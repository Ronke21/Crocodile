<text>X-ray binaries are a class of binary stars that are luminous in X-rays. 
The X-rays are produced by matter falling from one component, called the &quot;donor&quot; (usually a relatively common main sequence star), to the other component, called the &quot;accretor&quot;, which is either a neutron star or black hole. 
The infalling matter releases gravitational potential energy, up to 30 percent of its rest mass, as X-rays. (Hydrogen fusion releases only about 0.7 percent of rest mass.) The lifetime and the mass-transfer rate in an X-ray binary depends on the evolutionary status of the donor star, the mass ratio between the stellar components, and their orbital separation.

An estimated 1041 positrons escape per second from a typical low-mass X-ray binary.

==Classification==
X-ray binaries are further subdivided into several (sometimes overlapping) subclasses, that perhaps reflect the underlying physics better. Note that the classification by mass (high, intermediate, low) refers to the optically visible donor, not to the compact X-ray emitting accretor.

* Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs)
** Soft X-ray transients (SXTs)
** Symbiotic X-ray binaries
** Super soft X-ray sources or Super soft sources (SSXs), (SSXB)
** Accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs)
* Intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs)
** Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs)
* High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs)
** Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs)
** Supergiant X-ray binaries (SGXBs)
** Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs)
* Others
** X-ray bursters
** X-ray pulsars
** Microquasars (radio-jet X-ray binaries that can house either a neutron star or a black hole)

== Low-mass X-ray binary ==
A low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) is a binary star system where one of the components is either a black hole or neutron star. The other component, a donor, usually fills its Roche lobe and therefore transfers mass to the compact star. In LMXB systems the donor is less massive than the compact object, and can be on the main sequence, a degenerate dwarf (white dwarf), or an evolved star (red giant). Approximately two hundred LMXBs have been detected in the Milky Way, and of these, thirteen LMXBs have been discovered in globular clusters. The Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed LMXBs in many distant galaxies. 

A typical low-mass X-ray binary emits almost all of its radiation in X-rays, and typically less than one percent in visible light, so they are among the brightest objects in the X-ray sky, but relatively faint in visible light. The apparent magnitude is typically around 15 to 20. The brightest part of the system is the accretion disk around the compact object. The orbital periods of LMXBs range from ten minutes to hundreds of days.

The variability of LMXBs are most commonly observed as X-ray bursters, but can sometimes be seen in the form of X-ray pulsars. The X-ray bursters are created by thermonuclear explosions created by the accretion of Hydrogen and Helium.

== Intermediate-mass X-ray binary ==
An intermediate-mass X-ray binary (IMXB) is a binary star system where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole. The other component is an intermediate-mass star. An intermediate-mass X-ray binary is the origin for Low-mass X-ray binary systems.

== High-mass X-ray binary ==
A high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) is a binary star system that is strong in X rays, and in which the normal stellar component is a massive star: usually an O or B star, a blue supergiant, or in some cases, a red supergiant or a Wolf–Rayet star. 
The compact, X-ray emitting, component is a neutron star or black hole.
A fraction of the stellar wind of the massive normal star is captured by the compact object, and produces X-rays as it falls onto the compact object.

In a high-mass X-ray binary, the massive star dominates the emission of optical light, while the compact object is the dominant source of X-rays. 
The massive stars are very luminous and therefore easily detected. 
One of the most famous high-mass X-ray binaries is Cygnus X-1, which was the first identified black hole candidate. 
Other HMXBs include Vela X-1 (not to be confused with Vela X), and 4U 1700-37.

The variability of HMXBs are observed in the form of X-ray pulsars and not X-ray bursters. These X-ray pulsars are due to the accretion of matter magnetically funneled into the poles of the compact companion. The stellar wind and Roche lobe overflow of the massive normal star accretes in such large quantities, the transfer is very unstable and creates a short lived mass transfer.

Once a HMXB has reached its end, if the periodicity of the binary was less than a year, it can become a single red giant with a neutron core or a single neutron star. With a longer periodicity, a year and beyond, the HMXB can become a double neutron star binary if uninterrupted by a supernova.

== Microquasar ==

A microquasar (or radio emitting X-ray binary) is the smaller cousin of a quasar. Microquasars are named after quasars, as they have some common characteristics: strong and variable radio emission, often resolvable as a pair of radio jets, and an accretion disk surrounding a compact object which is either a black hole or a neutron star. In quasars, the black hole is supermassive (millions of solar masses); in microquasars, the mass of the compact object is only a few solar masses. In microquasars, the accreted mass comes from a normal star, and the accretion disk is very luminous in the optical and X-ray regions. Microquasars are sometimes called &quot;radio-jet X-ray binaries&quot; to distinguish them from other X-ray binaries. A part of the radio emission comes from relativistic jets, often showing apparent superluminal motion.

Microquasars are very important for the study of relativistic jets. The jets are formed close to the compact object, and timescales near the compact object are proportional to the mass of the compact object. Therefore, ordinary quasars take centuries to go through variations a microquasar experiences in one day.

Noteworthy microquasars include SS 433, in which atomic emission lines are visible from both jets; GRS 1915+105, with an especially high jet velocity and the very bright Cygnus X-1, detected up to the High Energy gamma rays (E &gt; 60 MeV). Extremely high energies of particles emitting in the VHE band might be explained by several mechanisms of particle acceleration (see Fermi acceleration and Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration).

<text>John Joly (; 1 November 1857 – 8 December 1933) was an Irish geologist and physicist known for his development of radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer. He is also known for developing techniques to more accurately estimate the age of a geological period, based on radioactive elements present in minerals, the uranium–thorium dating.

==Early life==
Joly was born in Holywood House (the Church of Ireland Rectory), Bracknagh, Kings&#x27;s County, Ireland. He was a second cousin of astronomer Charles Jasper Joly. He entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1876, graduating in Engineering in 1882 in first place with several special certificates in branches of engineering, at the same time obtaining a First Class Honours in modern literature. He worked as a demonstrator in Trinity&#x27;s Engineering and Physics departments before succeeding William Johnson Sollas in the Chair of Geology and Mineralogy in 1897, a position which he held until his death in 1933 in Dublin. A keen yachtsman, he served as a Commissioner for Irish Lights.

==Scientific career==
Joly joined the Royal Dublin Society in 1881 while still a student, and was a frequent contributor of papers. His first scientific paper was published in 1883, on the use of meteorological instruments at a distance. He published over 270 scientific papers.

In 1886, Joly proposed a theory on the slipperiness of ice. According to Joly, when the ice is forced to contract by the pressure applied, a film of liquid water is formed, upon which actual slipping occurs. Although this theory has recently been superseded, it was the first time someone tried to explain the mechanism behind ice low friction.

On 17 May 1899 Joly read his paper, &quot;An Estimate of the Geological Age of the Earth&quot;, to the Royal Dublin Society. In it, he proposed to calculate the age of the Earth from the accumulation of sodium in the waters of the oceans. He calculated the rate at which the oceans should have accumulated sodium from erosion processes, and determined that the oceans were about 80 to 100 million years old. The paper was quickly published, appearing 4 months later in the Society&#x27;s &quot;Scientific Transactions&quot;. Although this method was later considered inaccurate and was consequently superseded, it radically modified the results of other methods in use at the time.

In 1903 he published an article in &quot;Nature&quot; in which he discussed the possibility of using radium to date the Earth and went on to study the radioactive content of the Earth&#x27;s crust to formulate a theory of thermal cycles, and examined the radioactive constituents of certain rocks as a means of calculating their age. Working in collaboration with Sir Ernest Rutherford, he used radioactive decay in minerals to estimate, in 1913, that the beginning of the Devonian period could not be less than 400 million years ago, an estimate which is in line with modern calculations.

Joly served as President of Section C (Geology) when the British Association for the Advancement of Science which met in Dublin in 1908, during which he presented his paper &quot;Uranium and Geology&quot; an address to the society. This work described radioactive materials in rocks and their part in the generation of the Earth&#x27;s internal heat.

Along with his friend Henry Horatio Dixon, Joly also put forward the cohesion-tension theory which is now thought to be the main mechanism for the upward movement of water in plants.

In 1914, he developed a method of extracting radium and applied it in the treatment of cancer. As a Governor of Dr Steevens&#x27; Hospital in Dublin, in collaboration with Walter Stevenson he devised radiotherapy methods and promoted the establishment by the Royal Dublin Society of the Irish Radium Institute where they pioneered the &quot;Dublin method&quot; of using a hollow needle for deep radiotherapy, a technique that later entered worldwide use. The Radium Institute also supplied capillary tubes containing radon to hospitals for some years for use in the treatment of tumours.

==Inventions==
Joly invented a photometer for measuring light intensity, a for measuring the melting points of minerals, a differential steam calorimeter for measuring specific heats and a constant-volume gas thermometer, all of which bear his name, together with one of the first color photographic processes, the Joly colour screen. It was the first successful process for producing color images from a single photographic plate.

==Awards and honours==
===Awards===

*1892: Fellowship of the Royal Society
*1910: Royal Medal of the Royal Society
*1911: Boyle Medal of the Royal Dublin Society
*1923: Murchison Medal of the Geological Society of London

===Honours===
After his death, his friends subscribed the sum of £1,700 to set up a memorial fund which is still used to promote the annual Joly Memorial Lectures at the University of Dublin, which were inaugurated by Ernest Rutherford in 1935. He is also remembered by the Joly Geological Society, a student geological association established in 1960.

In 1930, Oliver Sheppard was commissioned by Trinity College Dublin and the Royal Dublin Society to make them copies of a bust of Joly.

In 1973, Joly, an impact crater on Mars, was named in his honour.

<text>In physics, a ripple tank is a shallow glass tank of water used to demonstrate the basic properties of waves. It is a specialized form of a wave tank. The ripple tank is usually illuminated from above, so that the light shines through the water. Some small ripple tanks fit onto the top of an overhead projector, i.e. they are illuminated from below. The ripples on the water show up as shadows on the screen underneath the tank. All the basic properties of waves, including reflection, refraction, interference and diffraction, can be demonstrated.

Ripples may be generated by a piece of wood that is suspended above the tank on elastic bands so that it is just touching the surface. Screwed to wood is a motor that has an off center weight attached to the axle. As the axle rotates the motor wobbles, shaking the wood and generating ripples.

==Demonstrating wave properties ==
A number of wave properties can be demonstrated with a ripple tank. These include plane waves, reflection, refraction, interference and diffraction.

==Plane waves==
When the rippler is lowered so that it just touches the surface of the water, plane waves will be produced.

==Circular waves==
When the rippler is attached with a point spherical ball and lowered so that it just touches the surface of the water, circular waves will be produced.

==Reflection==

===Demonstrating reflection and focusing of mirrors===
By placing a metal bar in the tank and tapping the wooden bar a pulse of three or four ripples can be sent towards the metal bar. The ripples reflect from the bar. If the bar is placed at an angle to the wavefront the reflected waves can be seen to obey the law of reflection. The angle of incidence and angle of reflection will be the same.

If a concave parabolic obstacle is used, a plane wave pulse will converge on a point after reflection. This point is the focal point of the mirror. Circular waves can be produced by dropping a single drop of water into the ripple tank. If this is done at the focal point of the &quot;mirror&quot; plane waves will be reflected back.

==Refraction==
If a sheet of glass is placed in the tank, the depth of water in the tank will be shallower over the glass than elsewhere. The speed of a wave in water depends on the depth, so the ripples slow down as they pass over the glass. This causes the wavelength to decrease. If the junction between the deep and shallow water is at an angle to the wavefront, the waves will refract. In the diagram above, the waves can be seen to bend towards the normal. The normal is shown as a dotted line. The dashed line is the direction that the waves would travel if they had not met the angled piece of glass.

In practice, showing refraction with a ripple tank is quite tricky to do. 
*The sheet of glass needs to be quite thick, with the water over it as shallow as possible. This maximizes the depth difference and so causes a greater velocity difference and therefore greater angle.
* If the water is &quot;too&quot; shallow, viscous drag effects cause the ripples to disappear very quickly.
* The glass should have smooth edges to minimize reflections at the edge.

==Diffraction==
If a small obstacle is placed in the path of the ripples, and a slow frequency is used, there is no shadow area as the ripples refract around it, as shown below on the right. A faster frequency may result in a shadow, as shown below on the right. If a large obstacle is placed in the tank, a shadow area will probably be observed.

If an obstacle with a small gap is placed in the tank the ripples emerge in an almost semicircular pattern. If the gap is large however, the diffraction is much more limited. &quot;Small&quot;, in this context, means that the size of the obstacle is comparable to the wavelength of the ripples.

==Diffraction from a grid==
A phenomenon identical to the x-ray diffraction of x-rays from an atomic crystal lattice can also be seen, thus demonstrating the principles of crystallography. If one lowers a grid of obstacles into the water, with the spacing between the obstacles roughly corresponding to the wavelength of the water waves, one will see diffraction from the grid. At certain angles between the grid and the oncoming waves, the waves will appear to reflect off the grid; at other angles, the waves will pass through. Similarly, if the frequency (wavelength) of the waves is altered, the waves will also alternately pass through or be reflected, depending on the precise relationship between spacing, orientation and wavelength.

==Interference==
Interference can be produced by the use of two dippers that are attached to the main ripple bar. In the diagrams below on the left the light areas represent crests of waves, the black areas represent troughs. Notice the grey areas: they are areas of destructive interference where the waves from the two sources cancel one another out. To the right is a photograph of two-point interference generated in a circular ripple tank.

<doc id="191724" wikidata="Q7615093" url="?curid=191724" title="Steven Norris">
<text>Steven John Norris (born 24 May 1945) is a British Conservative Party politician and businessman. Norris served as Member of Parliament for Oxford East from 1983 to 1987. After narrowly losing that marginal seat in 1987 he re-entered the House of Commons at a by-election for Epping Forest in 1988, which he held until stepping down to focus on his business career in 1997. He was subsequently chosen by Conservative Party members to be the Conservative candidate for Mayor of London in 2000 and 2004 in which he secured 42% and 45% respectively, coming second to Ken Livingstone but ahead of the Conservative Party&#x27;s vote share for the London Assembly.

==Early life and career==
Norris attended the Liverpool Institute for Boys, a grammar school, from 1956 to 1963 where he was Head Boy. He earned an open Exhibition in Social Studies and graduated from Worcester College, Oxford, where he was president of the University Law Society. After graduating, he pursued a career in the engineering and motor industries and entered politics upon election to Berkshire County Council in 1977, where he became deputy leader.

== Parliamentary and ministerial career ==
In 13 years as member of parliament, Norris was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to William Waldegrave, at the Department of the Environment; to Nicholas Ridley at the Department of Trade and Industry; and to Kenneth Baker at the Home Office. He was then promoted to minister for transport in London by John Major in 1992, where he was responsible for the Jubilee line Extension, the largest extension of the London Underground network to date, as well as the privatisation of London bus services.

== Public transport roles ==
Norris’ expertise on public transport issues led him to roles as chairman of the National Cycling Strategy Board, director general of the Road Haulage Association and president of the Motor Cycle Industry Association, and a commissioner with the Independent Transport Commission. He also served as patron of the cyclists charity, Sustrans, and of the Campaign for Better Transport (UK) Trust.

== Equality issues ==
Norris was a pioneer for equality for gays and lesbians before the law as a member of parliament and later as a mayoral candidate. In particular, Norris took the step of writing to the Conservative Party Chairman Chris Patten to suggest that the party include an equal age of consent in its next election manifesto. This change in the law was eventually achieved in 2001 under the Blair government.

Additionally, Norris registered the Conservative Parliamentary Group for Homosexual Law Reform with the party&#x27;s whips office and the 1922 Committee. Realising that the party would not make a manifesto commitment to age of consent equality, the group decided to lobby individual ministers and departments with an agenda for change. This included a review of the 1967 Sexual Offences Act to allow for an equal age of consent, as well as allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces; supporting a more liberal prosecution policy in Scotland; enforcement of existing Home Office advice against police entrapment and a more positive image for the Conservative Party on equality issues. Norris also was one of a handful of prominent Tories who lobbied against the discriminatory Section 28, ostensibly intended by its supporters to outlaw the teaching of homosexuality in schools, later was repealed by the Blair government and renounced by the Conservative Party under David Cameron. At the time of repeal, Norris opposed then leader William Hague’s support of the measure.

==London Mayoral bids==
===2000===
In September 1999, Norris contested Jeffrey Archer for the Conservative Party nomination for Mayor of London. Archer was initially selected as the candidate by party members, but was forced to withdraw later that year after it was revealed that he had committed perjury in a libel case. Archer was subsequently convicted of the crime and imprisoned. Norris was then selected as the Conservative Party candidate in a ballot of members in December of that year, going on to earn 42% of the vote against duly-elected London Mayor Ken Livingstone.

===2004===
In November 2002, Norris formally announced his intention to run again for the London mayoralty. In February 2003, he was again selected as the party&#x27;s candidate in a ballot of London party members. His platform included plans for after-hours London Underground services and an approach to crime based on the &#x27;broken windows&#x27; theory that had been championed by New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. Norris had met Giuliani during the campaign, and proposed an agreement with Giuliani Partners to advise him as mayor, should Norris be successful.

===2008===
Following speculation that he might run again for the mayoralty in 2008, and the extension of the party&#x27;s deadline for nominations in the hope of attracting a heavyweight candidate, Norris said in an interview that &quot;If I run, I&#x27;ll win&quot;, but ultimately chose not to apply. Subsequently, Boris Johnson became the party&#x27;s candidate.

==Business career==
 He is one of &quot;Property Week&quot;″s Property Power 100 and is chairman of Soho Estates, which controls around 60 acres of London&#x27;s Soho district. He is also chairman of London Resort Company Holdings, developers of the £3.5 billion entertainment resort project in Kent. He was Independent Non-Executive Chairman of This Land Limited, Cambridgeshire County Council&#x27;s arms- length property company from 2019 – 2022. He is Chairman of Future-Built Limited, a construction company, and of EVO.PM, a proptech maintenance company. He is also a partner with Craig Calder in Sanctuary Investments Limited.

In the infrastructure sector, he is chair of the Council of the National Infrastructure Planning Association and chairman of Driver Group plc. In the field of transportation, he was a member of the board of Transport for London under Mayor Boris Johnson. He is deputy chairman of bus manufacturer Optare. He was a main board member of Cubic Corporation of San Diego, California, a defence and transportation technology specialist, serving from 2014 until 2021, when the company was sold to Elliott and Veritas Capital. He remains an advisor to the UK business. He is Chairman of Evtec Automotive Limited, a Tier 1 supplier principally to Jaguar Land Rover. He was appointed chairman of Jarvis in 2003.

== Current voluntary roles ==
Norris is a former chairman of the Prince Michael International Road Safety Awards, currently a vice-president of both the Royal National Institute for the Deaf and the Institute of Advanced Motorists a Patron of The Urology Foundation and chairman of the Surrey Canal Sports Foundation. He is an Eminent Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Highways and Transportation, a Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers and an Honorary Fellow of the Association for Project Management. He is also president of Intelligent Transport Systems UK (ITS UK), the national industry association for transport technology. He holds an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of East London.

<text>Amberg () is a town in Bavaria, Germany. It is located in the Upper Palatinate about halfway between Regensburg and Bayreuth. 

== History ==

The town was first mentioned in 1034 with the name Ammenberg. It became an important trading centre in the Middle Ages, exporting mainly iron ore and iron products. In 1269, together with Bamberg, the town became subordinate to the Wittelsbach dynasty which ruled Bavaria.

In 1329 the town and the entire region fell to the Palatinate branch of the Wittelsbach family. The region adopted the name Upper Palatinate. It was no longer part of the duchy of Bavaria politically, though in geographic terms it was regarded as Bavarian and the region was part of the Bavarian circle in the organization of the Imperial Circles. In the 16th century, the rulers of Upper Palatinate turned to Protestantism. The town turned to Lutheranism. Later attempts of the ruling family to introduce the more radical Calvinism failed due to the reluctance of its citizens. In 1628 Amberg and Upper Palatinate became part of the electorate of Bavaria. The inhabitants were given the choice to return to Catholicism or emigrate. Many families left the town and moved to the Free Imperial Cities of Regensburg and Nuremberg.

On 24 August 1796, during the French Revolutionary Wars, a major battle, the Battle of Amberg was fought in the city and its environs at which 35,000 French, under the command of Jean Baptiste Jourdan fought with 40,000 Austrians under the command of Archduke Charles; the French suffered significantly more losses in the Austrian victory. Amberg was the regional capital of Upper Palatinate until 1810 when power was transferred to the larger city of Regensburg.

After World War II, when Bavaria fell into the American Sector, Amberg was home to Pond Barracks, a United States Army post. I.F.Stone writes about it in his book Underground to Palestine (pp. 31ff). The post was closed in 1992 and the facility turned over to the local community for housing, most of it for social housing.

In late 2018, the town was the site of the Amberg attacks resulting in Rainer Wendt asking the federal government to take a stand on the case. The city was reported to be &quot;in a state of emergency.&quot; Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian minister of the Interior, visited Amberg for consultations. Horst Seehofer, the federal minister of the Interior, said &quot;the violent attacks (were) worrisome.&quot;

=== Jewish history ===
Jews had settled in Amberg before 1294, when the first documentation can be found. Shortly after, in 1298, thirteen of the town Jews died during the Rindfleisch massacres. Nevertheless, in 1347 six families received permission to settle in Amberg and twenty years after, in 1367, a Yeshivah was opened in it, although the Jewish community was expelled from Amberg in 1403. Upon the expulsion, the synagogue was annexed to the nearby church. Twelve Jews remained in town in 1942. The few survivors returned to the town after 1945, and a displaced persons camp named Amberg-near the town-housed mostly Jewish refugees and survivors. As a result of immigration from the former USSR to Germany, the Jewish population grew to about 275 in 2003.There is a synagogue in town.

<text>The Skagerrak (, , ) is a strait running between the Jutland peninsula of Denmark, the east coast of Norway and the west coast of Sweden, connecting the North Sea and the Kattegat sea.

The Skagerrak contains some of the busiest shipping routes in the world, with vessels from every corner of the globe. It also supports an intensive fishing industry. The ecosystem is strained and negatively affected by direct human activities. Oslo and Gothenburg are the only large cities in the Skagerrak region.

The strait is likely named after Skagen, a town near the northern cape of Denmark, with &#x27;Rak&#x27; meaning &#x27;straight waterway&#x27;. The Skagerrak is 240 km long and 80–140 km wide, deepening towards the Norwegian coast. It has an average salinity comparable to other coastal waters, housing a variety of habitats.

Historically, the Skagerrak was the only access to the Baltic Sea until the construction of the Eider Canal in 1784. During both World Wars, the strait held strategic importance for Germany. Presently, it remains one of the busiest straits worldwide.

The Skagerrak is a habitat for approximately 2,000 marine species, including a unique variety of Atlantic cod. It also contains sandy and stony reefs and cold-water coral reefs. Environmental institutions have expressed concern about increasing pressure on the ecosystem due to human activities and climate change. Protections are in place, with several marine protected areas in Skagerrak, including Ytre Hvaler National Park in Norway and Kosterhavet National Park in Sweden.

==Name==
The meaning of &quot;Skagerrak&quot; is most likely the Skagen Channel/Strait. Skagen is a town near the northern cape of Denmark (The Skaw). In Dutch, means &#x27;straight waterway&#x27;, as seen in Dutch hydronyms such as Damrak, Gouderak, Langerak, Tuikwerderrak, and Volkerak), cognate with . The ultimate source of this syllable is the Proto-Indo-European root *reg-, &#x27;straight&#x27;. &quot;Rak&quot; means &#x27;straight&#x27; as in &#x27;straight ahead&#x27; in modern Norwegian and Swedish. &quot;Råk&quot; in both modern Norwegian and Swedish refers to a channel or opening of water in an otherwise ice-covered body of water. There is no evidence to suggest a connection with the modern Danish word &quot;rak&quot; (meaning rabble or riff-raff). It is therefore likely that the Skagerrak was named by Dutch seafarers, as was the adjacent Kattegat.

==Geography==
The Skagerrak is long and between wide. It deepens toward the Norwegian coast, reaching over 700 m at the Norwegian Trench. Some ports along the Skagerrak are Oslo, Larvik and Kristiansand in Norway, Skagen, Hirtshals and Hanstholm in Denmark and Uddevalla, Lysekil and Strömstad in Sweden.

The Skagerrak has an average salinity of 80 practical salinity units, which is very low, close to that of brackish water, but comparable to most other coastal waters. The area available to biomass is about and includes a wide variety of habitats, from shallow sandy and stony reefs in Sweden and Denmark to the depths of the Norwegian trench.

===Extent===

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Skagerrak as follows:

&quot;On the West.&quot; A line joining Hanstholm () and the Naze (Lindesnes, ).

&quot;On the Southeast.&quot; The Northern limit of the Kattegat [A line joining Skagen (The Skaw, North Point of Denmark) and Paternosterskären () and thence Northeastward through the shoals to Tjörn Island].

==History==
Older names for the combined Skagerrak and Kattegat were the &quot;Norwegian Sea&quot; or &quot;Jutland Sea&quot;; the latter appears in the Knýtlinga saga.

Until the construction of the Eider Canal in 1784 (a predecessor to the Kiel Canal), Skagerrak was the only way in and out of the Baltic Sea. For this reason, the strait has had busy international traffic for centuries. After the Industrial Revolution, the traffic increased and today Skagerrak is among the busiest straits in the world. In 1862, a short cut, the Thyborøn Channel at the Limfjord was constructed in Denmark through Skagerrak from the North Sea by going directly to the Kattegat. The Limfjord supports only minor transports though.

In both world wars, the Skagerrak was strategically very important for Germany. The biggest sea battle of the First World War, the Battle of Jutland, also known as the Battle of the Skagerrak, took place here May 31 to June 1, 1916. In the Second World War, the importance of controlling this waterway, the only sea access to the Baltic, was the motive for the German invasions of Denmark and Norway as well as the construction of the northern parts of the Atlantic Wall. Both of these naval engagements have contributed to the large number of shipwrecks in the Skagerrak.

== Traffic and industry ==
Skagerrak is a busy shipping lane, with c. 7,500 individual vessels (excluding fishing vessels) from all over the world visiting in 2013 alone. Cargo ships are by far the most common vessel in Skagerrak at c. 4,000 individual ships in 2013, followed by tankers, which are nearly half as frequent. When viewed in combination with the Baltic Sea area, ships from 122 different nationalities visited in 2013, with most of these carrying cargo or passengers within Europe, regardless of their flag state.

Nearly all commercial vessels in Skagerrak are tracked by the Automatic Identification System (AIS).

== Recreation ==
Skagerrak is popular for recreational activities in all three countries. There are many summer house residences and several marinas along the coasts.

==Biology==
The Skagerrak is habitat for approximately 2,000 marine species, many of them adapted to its waters. For example, a variety of Atlantic cod called the Skagerrak cod spawns off the Norwegian coast. The eggs are buoyant and the hatchlings feed on zooplankton. Juveniles sink to the bottom where they have a shorter maturity cycle (2 years). They do not migrate but remain local to Norwegian fjords.

The variety of habitats and the large volume of plankton on the surface support prolific marine life. Energy moves from the top to the bottom according to Vinogradov&#x27;s ladder of migrations; that is, some species are benthic and others pelagic, but there are graded marine layers within which species move vertically for short distances. In addition, some species are benthopelagic, moving between surface and bottom. The benthic species include &quot;Coryphaenoides rupestris&quot;, &quot;Argentina silus&quot;, &quot;Etmopterus spinax&quot;, &quot;Chimaera monstrosa&quot; and &quot;Glyptocephalus cynoglossus&quot;. On the top are &quot;Clupea harengus&quot;, &quot;Scomber scombrus&quot;, &quot;Sprattus sprattus&quot;. Some species that move between are &quot;Pandalus borealis&quot;, &quot;Sabinea sarsi&quot;, &quot;Etmopterus spinax&quot;.

=== Reefs ===
Apart from sandy and stony reefs, extensive cold water coral reefs, mostly of &quot;Lophelia&quot;, are growing in Skagerrak. The Säcken Reef in the Swedish marine protection of Koster Fjord is an ancient cold water coral reef and the only known coral reef in the country. The Tisler Reef in the Norwegian marine protection of Ytre Hvaler National Park is the largest known coral reef in Europe. Lophelia reefs are also present in the Norwegian trench and they are known from the shallow waters of many Norwegian fjords.

Skagerrak also holds a number of rare bubble reefs; biological reefs formed around cold seeps of geological carbohydrate outgassings, usually methane. These rare habitats are mostly known from the Danish waters of Skagerrak west of Hirtshals, but more might be discovered in future surveys. Bubbly reefs are very rare in Europe and supports a very varied ecosystem.

With the centuries-long heavy international seatraffic of Skagerrak, the seabed also holds an abundance of shipwrecks. Wrecks on shallow waters, provides a firm anchoring for several corals and polyps and explored wrecks have been revealed to support Dead Man&#x27;s Fingers corals, Brittle stars and large wolffish. A 2020 seafloor mapping project around Jammerbugten in Skaggerak, ran by Danish explorer Klaus Thymann, found evidence of much greater biodiversity in a range seafloor habitats previously thought to be sandy with a low density of wildlife. Dead Man’s Fingers corals were again among the species documented for the first time in these coastal habitats.

== Environmental concerns ==
Scientists and environmental institutions have expressed concern about the increasing pressure on the ecosystem in Skagerrak. The pressure has already had negative impacts and is caused by cumulative environmental effects, of which direct human activities are only one piece of the puzzle. Climate change and ocean acidification are expected to have increasing impacts on the Skagerrak ecosystem in the future.

Skagerrak and the North Sea receives considerable inputs of hazardous material and radioactive substances. Most is ascribed to long-range transport from other countries, but not all. Marine litter is also a growing problem. Until recently, waste water and sewage pouring into Skagerrak from settlements and industries was not treated at all. In combination with wash out of excessive nutrients from conventional farming, this has often led to large algae blooms.

== Protections ==
There are several marine protections in Skagerrak, including:

;Norway
* Ytre Hvaler National Park, established on 26 June 2009
* Raet National Park, established on 16 December 2016

;Sweden
* Kosterhavet National Park
* Bratten, a newly designated Natura 2000 sea area beyond Kosterhavet. Pockmarks and biogenic reefs at depths of . 
* Gullmarsfjorden, Sweden&#x27;s first marine conservation area from 1983.

;Denmark
* Grenen and a sea area immediately north.

<text>Sir Godfrey Kneller, 1st Baronet (born Gottfried Kniller; 8 August 1646 – 19 October 1723) was a German-born British painter. The leading portraitist in England during the late Stuart and early Georgian eras, he served as court painter to successive English and British monarchs, including Charles II of England and George I of Great Britain. Kneller also painted scientists such as Isaac Newton, foreign monarchs such as Louis XIV of France and visitors to England such as Michael Shen Fu-Tsung. A pioneer of the kit-cat portrait, he was also commissioned by William III of England to paint eight &quot;Hampton Court Beauties&quot; to match a similar series of paintings of Charles II&#x27;s &quot;Windsor Beauties&quot; that had been painted by Kneller&#x27;s predecessor as court painter, Peter Lely.

==Early life==
Kneller was born Gottfried Kniller in the Free City of Lübeck, the son of Zacharias Kniller, a portrait painter. Kneller studied in Leiden, but became a pupil of Ferdinand Bol and Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn in Amsterdam. He then travelled with his brother John Zacharias Kneller, who was an ornamental painter, to Rome and Venice in the early 1670s, painting historical subjects and portraits in the studio of Carlo Maratti, and later moved to Hamburg.

==Career==

The brothers came to England in 1676, and won the patronage of the Duke of Monmouth. He was introduced to, and painted a portrait of, Charles II.

In England, Kneller concentrated almost entirely on portraiture. In the spirit of enterprise, he founded a studio which churned out portraits on an almost industrial scale, relying on a brief sketch of the face with details added to a formulaic model, aided by the fashion for gentlemen to wear full wigs. His portraits set a pattern that was followed until William Hogarth and Joshua Reynolds.

Nevertheless, he established himself as a leading portrait artist in England. When Sir Peter Lely died in 1680, Kneller was jointly appointed Principal Painter in Ordinary with John Riley to the Crown by Charles II.

For about 20 years (–1702) he lived at No. 16-17 The Great Piazza, Covent Garden. Kneller&#x27;s studio manager was Edward Byng.

In the 1690s, Kneller painted the Hampton Court Beauties depicting the most glamorous ladies-in-waiting of the Royal Court for which he received, in 1692, his knighthood from William III. In 1695, he received, in the presence of the king, an honorary Doctorate of Law from the University of Oxford. In 1700, he was created a Knight of the Holy Roman Empire by Emperor Leopold I. He produced a series of &quot;Kit-cat&quot; portraits of 48 leading politicians and men of letters, members of the Kit-Cat Club.

Created a baronet by King George I on 24 May 1715, he was also head of the &quot;Kneller Academy of Painting and Drawing&quot; from 1711 until 1716 in Great Queen Street, London, which counted such artists as Thomas Gibson amongst its founding directors. His paintings were praised by Whig members including John Dryden, Joseph Addison, Richard Steele, and Alexander Pope.

On the landing in Horsham Museum in West Sussex hang works of art from the museum&#x27;s extensive painting collection, featuring a large 18th-century portrait of Charles Eversfield and his wife, of Denne Park House.

==Personal life==
He married a widow, Susanna Grave, on 23 January 1704 at St Bride&#x27;s Church, London. She was the daughter of the Reverend John Cawley, Archdeacon of Lincoln and Rector of Henley-on-Thames, and the granddaughter of regicide William Cawley. The couple had no children.

==Death==
Kneller died of fever in 1723 at Great Queen Street and his remains were interred at Twickenham. He had been a churchwarden at St Mary&#x27;s, Twickenham, when the 14th-century nave collapsed in 1713 and was active in the plans for the church&#x27;s reconstruction by John James. His widow was buried at Twickenham on 11 December 1729.

==Legacy==
A memorial was erected in Westminster Abbey. Kneller&#x27;s will gave a pension of £100 a year to his assistant Edward Byng and entrusted Byng with seeing that all unfinished work was completed. Byng also inherited the drawings in Kneller&#x27;s studio. Kneller and his wife had no children together. Most of his fortune was inherited by his grandson, Godfrey Kneller Huckle, who was the son of Agnes Huckle, Kneller&#x27;s illegitimate daughter by Mrs Voss, and who took his grandfather&#x27;s surname (Kneller) as a condition of his inheritance.

The site of the house Kneller built in 1709 in Whitton, near Twickenham, became occupied by the mid-19th century Kneller Hall, home of the Royal Military School of Music.

==Character==

==Works==
In his hometown Lübeck there are works to be seen in the St. Annen Museum and in Saint Catherine Church. His former works at St. Mary&#x27;s Church were destroyed by the Bombing of Lübeck 1942. A large oil portrait (84&quot; x 55&quot;) of James VII of Scotland (King James II of England) hangs on the main staircase of private members&#x27; Club, The Caledonian Club, in Belgravia, London.

A portrait of Queen Anne that belongs to Trinity Hospital in Retford, Nottinghamshire has been attributed to Kneller by the auctioneers Phillips – though it is unsigned. The hospital has a strong connection with Queen Anne, the founder being a first cousin of her grandmother. The portrait was restored and cleaned in 1999.

<text>Pantyhose, sometimes also called sheer tights, are close-fitting legwear covering the wearer&#x27;s body from the waist to the toes. Pantyhose first appeared on store shelves in 1959 for the advertisement of new design panties (Allen Gant&#x27;s product, &#x27;Panti-Legs&#x27;) as a convenient alternative to stockings and/or control panties which, in turn, replaced girdles.

Like stockings or knee highs, pantyhose are usually made of nylon, or of other fibers blended with nylon. Pantyhose are designed to:
* Be attractive in appearance,
* Hide physical features such as blemishes, bruises, scars, leg hair, spider veins, or varicose veins,
* Give skin a tanner, less pale appearance,
* Reduce visible panty lines, and
* Ease chafing between feet and footwear, or between thighs.

Besides being worn as fashion, in Western society pantyhose are sometimes worn by women as part of formal dress. Also, the dress code of some companies and schools may require pantyhose or fashion tights to be worn when skirts or shorts are worn as part of a uniform.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;pantyhose&quot; originated in the United States and rid the combination of &quot;panties&quot; (an American English term) with sheer nylon &quot;hosiery&quot;. In British English, these garments are called &quot;sheer tights&quot;. The term tights alone refers to all such garments regardless of whether they are sheer lingerie or sturdy outerwear.

In American English, the term &quot;tights&quot; typically refers to pantyhose-like garments made from thicker material, which are generally opaque or slightly translucent. Opaque leg wear made of material such as spandex are often worn by both sexes for athletic activities or as utility clothing, and are usually referred to as &quot;leggings&quot;, a term that includes casual wear. The primary difference between tights and leggings is that leggings can be worn as outerwear, whereas tights are not. In most cases, leggings will have a seam on the inside of the leg, whereas the legs of tights will be seamless. Leggings will often be footless, whereas tights usually will not.

==History==

The history of pantyhose, as for stockings, is tied to that of changes in styles of women&#x27;s hemlines. Before the 1920s, it was generally expected that women would cover their legs in public, including their ankles; dress and skirt hemlines were generally to the ground. The main exceptions were in sports and entertainment, making tights a more suitable choice. In cases of high-cut legs or fabrics that would produce a visible panty line, it was a practical necessity to wear them as the only lower undergarment. In the 1920s, fashionable hemlines for women began to rise, exposing the legs to just below the knees. Stockings also came into vogue to maintain leg coverage, as well as some level of warmth. The most popular stockings were sheer hosiery which were first made of silk or rayon (then known as &quot;artificial silk&quot;), and, after 1940, made of nylon, which had been invented by DuPont in 1938. During the 1940s and 1950s, stage and film producers would sew stockings to the briefs of their actresses and dancers, as testified to by singer-actress-dancer Ann Miller. These garments were seen in popular motion pictures such as &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot;.

In 1953, Allen Gant Sr. of Glen Raven Knitting Mills developed a commercial equivalent to these hose that he named &quot;Panti-Legs&quot;, but these were not brought to the open market until about 1959. During this time, Ernest G. Rice invented his own design for pantyhose similar to those worn today, and in 1956 he submitted a patent titled &quot;Combination Stockings and Panty&quot;. This design was adopted by other makers, and this caused disputes in U.S. courts for many years before the patent was upheld some time after Rice&#x27;s own death. Meanwhile, the yarn manufacturer Chemstrand already presented a product with an opaque panty part and gusset called &quot;leotard-stockings&quot; in November 1958. In 1974, actress Julie Newmar successfully filed a patent for &quot;Pantyhose with shaping band for cheeky derriere relief&quot;, a garment innovation made famous through the costume she designed in the 1960s for her role as Catwoman in the TV show Batman. 

Up until this time, there was little reason for women outside show business to wear &quot;panty hose&quot;, as the longer hemlines allowed for the use of over-the-knee stockings secured with a garter belt. Nonetheless, during the 1960s, improved textile manufacturing processes made pantyhose increasingly more affordable, while human-made textiles such as spandex (or elastane) made them more comfortable and durable. The advent of the fashionable miniskirt, which exposed the legs to well above the knee, made pantyhose a necessity to many women. In 1970, U.S. sales of pantyhose exceeded stockings for the first time, and it has remained so ever since. Pantyhose became a wardrobe staple throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

From 1995 a steady decline began, leveling off in 2006 with U.S. sales less than half of what they had once been. This decline has been attributed to bare legs in fashion, changes in workplace dress code, and the increased popularity of trousers.

While sales of traditional styles did not recover, the 2000s saw the rise of other specific styles. Fishnet hose, patterns and colors, opaque tights, low-rise pantyhose, footless shapewear, and pantyhose for men (playfully referred to as &quot;mantyhose&quot;) all experienced increased sales. In the 2010s, an increasing popularity for form-fitting opaque leggings paired with casual dress (and even some officewear) supplanted the fashion role previously held by pantyhose, although pantyhose remain popular as part of formalwear.

==Composition==

Pantyhose generally have a standard construction: the top of the waist is a strong elastic; the part covering the hips and the buttocks (the panty area) is composed of a thicker material than for the legs. The gusset or crotch covering the genitalia is a stronger material, sometimes made of porous cotton, but the legs of the pantyhose are made of the thinnest usable fabrics, and it has a consistent construction down to the wearer&#x27;s toes. These can be reinforced to guard against wear and tear.

Most pantyhose are composed of nylon and a mixture of spandex, which provides the elasticity and form-fitting that is characteristic of modern pantyhose. The nylon fabric is somewhat prone to tearing (&quot;running&quot;), and it is common for very sheer hose to &quot;run&quot; soon after snagging on anything that is rough or sharp.

Variations in pantyhose construction exist, such as with fishnet pantyhose. Pantyhose may be composed of other materials such as silk, cotton, cashmere or wool.

==Styles==
Pantyhose are available in a wide range of styles. The sheerness of the garment, expressed as a numerical &quot;denier&quot;/&#x27;dtex&quot;, ranges from 3 (extremely rare, very thin, barely visible) up to 20 (standard sheer), 30 (semi opaque) up to 250 (opaque). The term denier is often referred to the weight of the yarn that was used to produce the item of hosiery. A higher denier of yarn results in a thicker pair of tights.

Control-top pantyhose, intended to boost a slimmer figure, has a reinforced-panty section. The panty section may be visible when wearing short skirts or shorts.

Sheer-to-waist pantyhose is sheer throughout, with the panty portion being the same thickness and color as the leg portion, and are designed for use with high-slit gowns, miniskirts, hot pants, or lingerie. Often sheer-to-waist pantyhose will be reinforced along and on either side of the seam in the middle of the panty. Often sheer-to-waist pantyhose comes with sandal toes - invisibly reinforced toes part.

Open toe pantyhose starts from the waist and ends just before the toes, leaving toes free, which allows legs to be covered with the tights, but toes to be shown in sandals or peep toe shoes.

Open-crotch pantyhose, sometimes known as crotchless pantyhose, do not have a gusset. Instead, an opening is in place for hygiene or sexual-fetishism activities.

Some pantyhose have single- or double-panel gussets incorporated into them. In single-panel, there are two seams instead of the usual one, with a single seam on the opposite side; with double-panel gussets, there are two seams on either side.

==Concerns==
The disadvantages of pantyhose includes:
* Unlike cotton, nylon is not an absorbent material. As a result, perspiration is more likely to remain in contact with the feet, legs and genital area, thereby encouraging bacterial growth and associated odor. Some hosiery products contain silver to help prevent odor and sweating of the feet, thus making the wearing of hosiery a more pleasant experience. Wearing natural fiber silk stockings and tights is another means of reducing perspiration. 
* Some women do not wear pantyhose for environmental reasons, noting that they usually cannot be recycled, and nylon pantyhose are not biodegradable. Disposing of the item contributes to overuse of landfill. Burning nylon pantyhose sometimes releases toxins into the atmosphere. 

In the UK, local authorities accept clean, dry textiles along with other recyclables. This is both at recycling centres and curb-side collections. Textiles (including tights, pantyhose and stockings) which cannot be re-worn are recycled and turned into things like roofing felt. There are several internet sites which explain ways of reusing pantyhose (laddered or otherwise). In the US, nylon stockings, tights, and pantyhose can be sent to Recycled Crafts to be used in craft projects like pet toys, rugs, placemats, and table runners. Swedish Stockings, maker of hosiery, has a program to grind down old pantyhose for use in oil and grease traps. In the past, hosiery manufacturer No Nonsense had a recycling program, and so did Matter of Trust.

* Pantyhose have been criticized for being flimsy because the thin knit fabric is prone to tearing or laddering (or &quot;running&quot;). The wearer can cause a run in the hose by catching a toenail in the fabric when the hose is put on, by catching it on a rough surface like a corner of a desk, or a car, and by numerous other risks. Some women apply clear nail polish or hair spray to their hose to prevent runs from growing. Some of brands offer &quot;ladder-resist&quot; pantyhose which are more durable than regular ones.

==Use by men==
While considered to be a woman&#x27;s garment, pantyhose can also be worn by men as long johns and for super hero situations. . Race horse jockeys may wear pantyhose under their uniform to enable them to glide freely over the legs and waist when the jockey&#x27;s body moves at a rapid pace. Some fishermen who surf fish from tropical beaches may wear pantyhose for protection from jellyfish whose stingers are triggered by contact with a chemical on bare skin. In the late 1990s, several manufacturers introduced pantyhose styles designed for men to cater to this niche market.

<text>USS &quot;Kentucky&quot; (BB-6), was the second and final pre-dreadnought battleship built for the United States Navy in the 1890s. Designed for coastal defense, the &quot;Kearsarge&quot;-class battleships had a low freeboard and heavy armor. The ships carried an armament of four and four guns in an unusual two-story turret arrangement. The Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Virginia laid down her keel on 30 June 1896. She was launched on 24 March 1898 and was commissioned on 15 May 1900.

In her twenty years of service, &quot;Kentucky&quot; participated in no combat. Between 1901 and 1904, she served in East Asia, and from 1904 to 1907 she cruised the Atlantic. In 1907, she joined the Great White Fleet on its world tour, returning to the United States in 1909. She was modernized between 1909 and 1911, but did not operate again until 1915, when she sailed to the Mexican coast to participate in the American intervention in the Mexican Revolution, where she stayed until 1916. From 1917 until her decommissioning on 29 May 1920, she served as a training ship. She was sold for scrap on 24 March 1923.

== Design ==

The &quot;Kearsarge&quot;-class battleships were designed to be used for coastal defense. They had a displacement of , an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . The two 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines and five Scotch boilers, connected to two propeller shafts, produced a total of , and gave a maximum speed of . &quot;Kentucky&quot; was manned by 40 officers and 514 enlisted men, a total of 554 crew.

&quot;Kentucky&quot;, like , had two double turrets, with two /35 caliber guns and two /40 caliber guns each, stacked on two levels. The guns and turret armor were designed by the Bureau of Ordnance, while the turret itself was designed by the Bureau of Construction and Repair. The configuration caused the guns to be mounted far back in the turret, making the ports very large. Admiral William Sims claimed that as a result of the gun mounting, a shell fired into the port could reach the magazines below, disabling the guns. In addition to these guns, &quot;Kentucky&quot; carried fourteen /40 caliber guns, twenty 6-pounder () guns, eight 1-pounder () guns, four machine guns, and four  torpedo tubes. &quot;Kentucky&quot; had a very low freeboard, often making her guns unusable during bad weather.

The ship&#x27;s waterline armor belt was thick. Her main gun turrets were protected by of armor, while the secondary turrets had of armor. The barbettes were thick, and the conning tower had of armor. The ship&#x27;s armor was made of harveyized steel.

== Construction ==
&quot;Kentucky&quot; was authorized on 2 March 1895. The contract for her construction was awarded on 2 January 1896, and her keel was laid down on 30 June 1896 by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company in Virginia. The total cost was $4,998,119.43. In preparation for the &quot;Kentucky&quot;″s christening, the Navy asked Kentucky Governor William O&#x27;Connell Bradley to select a member of his family to perform the ceremony. Bradley chose his daughter, Christine, who was attending school in Washington, D.C. The Bradleys were a family of teetotalers, so Governor Bradley sent a bottle of water from Lincoln Spring in Hodgenville, Kentucky, for Christine to use during the ceremony. &quot;Kentucky&quot; was christened on 24 March 1898, the same day as her sister ship, &quot;Kearsarge&quot;. Soon after Miss Bradley broke the bottle of water over the &quot;Kentucky&quot;″s bow, a delegation from the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, led by Frances Beauchamp, presented the governor&#x27;s daughter with a gift of a silver tray, a water pitcher, and two goblets. The inscription read, &quot;Kentucky Christian Temperance Union to Miss Christine Bradley, as a tribute to her loyalty to conviction in the christening of the Battleship &quot;Kentucky&quot; with water. March 10, 1898.&quot; &quot;Kentucky&quot; was commissioned on 15 May 1900, under the command of Captain Colby Mitchell Chester.

== Service history ==
During the summer of 1900, &quot;Kentucky&quot; was fitted out in the New York Navy Yard. On 26 October, during the Boxer Rebellion, she left Tompkinsville, Staten Island for China, passing through Gibraltar and the Suez Canal. On 5 February 1901 she arrived at Manila, and on 23 March she replaced the protected cruiser as the flagship of Rear Admiral Louis Kempff. Between 1901 and 1904, &quot;Kentucky&quot; visited numerous ports in China and Japan, including Yantai, Wusong, Nanjing, Taku Forts, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Nagasaki, Kobe, and Yokohama. In 1902, &quot;Kentucky&quot; became the flagship of Rear Admiral Frank Wildes, although he moved his flag to the distilling ship on 12 April 1902. In November 1902, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans.

On 13 March 1904 she sailed from Manila, passing through the Suez Canal and the Strait of Gibraltar, and arriving at New York City on 21 May. After receiving upgrades at the New York Navy Yard, including the addition of smoke ejectors, &quot;Kentucky&quot; joined the North Atlantic Squadron. The battleship participated in the welcome of the British North Atlantic Squadron at Annapolis, Maryland, in October 1905. During the 1906 Cuban Insurrection, she carried Marines to Cuba, embarking them from Provincetown on 23 September, and landing them at Havana, Cuba, on 1 October. She remained there until 9 October, and then returned to New England. &quot;Kentucky&quot; attended the Jamestown Exposition at Norfolk, Virginia, on 15 April 1907, and then participated in exercises off the New England coast.

In 1907, the Great White Fleet was ordered by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to circle the world, as a demonstration of the might of the United States Navy. &quot;Kentucky&quot; was attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron, and was commanded by Captain Walter C. Cowles, while the fleet as a whole was commanded by Rear Admiral Evans, &quot;Kentucky&quot;″s former flag officer. On 16 December 1907, the fleet saluted the presidential yacht , and left from Hampton Roads. The fleet then sailed south, passing Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and going through the Straits of Magellan. From there she passed the west coast of South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet arrived at San Diego on 14 April 1908 and continued to San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later it arrived at Honolulu, and from there sailed to Auckland, New Zealand, arriving on 9 August. On 20 August, the fleet reached Sydney, Australia, and a week later sailed for Melbourne.

&quot;Kentucky&quot; departed Albany, Western Australia, on 18 September, passing through ports in the Philippine Islands, Japan, China, and Ceylon before traveling through the Suez Canal. The fleet split at Port Said on 8 January 1909, with &quot;Kentucky&quot; visiting Tripoli and Algiers before rejoining the other ships at Gibraltar. She returned to Hampton Roads on 22 February, and was inspected by President Roosevelt.

===Later service===
As with most of the Great White Fleet ships, &quot;Kentucky&quot; was modernized on her return. She was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 28 August 1909, and her modernization was completed in 1911, at a cost of $675,000. The ship received cage masts, new water-tube boilers, and another four 5-inch guns. The 1-pounder guns were removed, as were sixteen of the 6-pounders. On 4 June 1912, she was recommissioned in the Second Reserve, and on 31 May 1913 she was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in Philadelphia.

She was recommissioned again at Philadelphia on 23 June 1915. On 11 September that year, following the United States occupation of Veracruz, she sailed to Mexico, arriving at Veracruz on 28 September. She remained there during the Mexican Revolution, staying until 2 June 1916, except for a visit to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras festival in March 1916. The battleship stopped at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Santo Domingo on her way back to Philadelphia, arriving there on 18 June 1916. From July until September, she trained militiamen near Block Island and Boston. On 2 October &quot;Kentucky&quot; returned to New York, and entered the New York Naval Shipyard on 2 January 1917, remaining there until the United States entered World War I. She arrived at Yorktown, Virginia on 2 May, and trained recruits along the Atlantic coast, from Chesapeake Bay to Long Island Sound. During the war, she trained several thousand men, in 15 groups of recruits.

&quot;Kentucky&quot; was overhauled at the Boston Navy Yard, beginning on 20 December 1918. On 18 March 1919, she left for exercises in Guantánamo Bay, Norfolk, and along the New England coast. Between 29 May and 30 August 1919, &quot;Kentucky&quot; trained United States Naval Academy midshipmen. Following World War I, the United States agreed to the Washington Naval Treaty, which was aimed at preventing a naval arms race by limiting the size of the signatories&#x27; fleets. As a result, many old and obsolete ships were scrapped, including &quot;Kentucky&quot;. &quot;Kentucky&quot; was decommissioned on 29 May 1920. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 May 1922 and she was sold for scrap to Dravo Corporation on 24 March 1923.

<text>Simon Marius (latinized form of Simon Mayr; 10 January 1573 – 5 January 1625) was a German astronomer. He was born in Gunzenhausen, near Nuremberg, but spent most of his life in the city of Ansbach. He is best known for being among the first observers of the four largest moons of Jupiter, and his publication of his discovery led to charges of plagiarism.

==Early life==
Marius was the son of Reichart Mayr, a mayor of Gunzenhausen. On the recommendation of George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, he was admitted to the Margrave&#x27;s Academy in Heilsbronn in 1586, where he studied until 1601. During this time, he published observations about a comet as well as astronomical tables, which gave him a reputation as a good astronomer and mathematician, and the Margrave appointed him as his official mathematician. Marius wanted to attend the University of Königsberg, but was unable to get a scholarship. However, the Margrave wrote a letter of recommendation on 22 May 1601, so that Marius could study in Prague under Tycho Brahe, which he did for several months, although he may actually have worked directly with David Fabricius instead of Brahe himself.

By September 1601, Marius had already left Prague and he arrived in Padua in December 1601 to study medicine at the University of Padua. During this time, he tutored other students in astronomy, including one Baldassarre Capra, with whom he wrote a book on a new star (actually Kepler&#x27;s Supernova) which they had observed in 1604. Capra had a dispute with Galileo Galilei (both of them learned fencing from Capra&#x27;s father) on the invention of the proportional compass and Marius took his student&#x27;s side in the argument. Marius left the school in July 1605, returning to Ansbach to become the mathematician and physician to the new Margraves, Christian and Joachim Ernst.

In 1606, Marius married Felicitas Lauer (born 1590), the daughter of his publisher, in Ansbach, and in 1609 he published the first German translations of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. That year, he also built his own telescope and in November made observations of the Galilean moons, slightly before Galileo did himself; this became the source of a major dispute between the two.

== Dispute with Galileo ==
Capra published another book in 1607 which he actually plagiarised from Galileo, and Marius was implicated in the act due to his prior association with Capra, even though this was after Marius had left Padua. Galileo certainly was under that impression, as he referred to his &quot;old adversary&quot; (without explicitly naming Marius) as a &quot;poisonous reptile&quot;, and an &quot;enemy of all mankind&quot;.

In 1614, Marius published his work &quot;Mundus Iovialis&quot; (English: &quot;World of Jupiter&quot;) describing the planet Jupiter and its moons (he previously had published the discovery in 1611 in a local almanac). Here he claimed to have discovered the planet&#x27;s four major moons about a month before Galileo, who was naturally incensed. In &quot;The Assayer&quot; in 1623, he accused Marius of plagiarism.

Because of Galileo&#x27;s stature in the scientific community, for nearly 300 years, Marius&#x27;s reputation was tainted by Galileo&#x27;s accusations. However, a scientific committee in the Netherlands in 1903 examined the evidence extensively and ruled in favor of Marius&#x27;s independent discoveries, with results published by Johannes Bosscha in 1907. Apparently Marius discovered the moons independently, but did not start keeping notes until 29 December 1609. Marius used the Julian calendar, and that date is equivalent to 8 January 1610, in the Gregorian one used by Galileo, one day after Galileo&#x27;s letter in which he first described the moons.

Regardless of priority, the mythological names by which these satellites are known today (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) are those given them by Marius:
==Discoveries==
Simon Marius also observed the Andromeda &quot;nebula&quot;, which had also been known to Persian astronomers of the Middle Ages.

Discussion of Marius&#x27; work is scarce, but what exists tends to note his skill as an observer, including:
* That in 1612 he measured the diameter of the Andromeda nebula and discerned it as having a dull, pale light which increased in brightness toward its center, like &quot;a candle shining through horn&quot;.
* That he detected spurious disks of stars created by his telescope.
* That, from his observations of the Galilean moons he derived better periods of revolution and other orbital elements for them than did Galileo.
* That he observed the location of Tycho Brahe&#x27;s supernova of 1572 and found a star there which he estimated to be &quot;somewhat dimmer than Jupiter&#x27;s third moon&quot;.

Marius drew conclusions about the structure of the universe from his observations of the Jovian moons and the stellar disks. The stellar disks he observed were spurious (likely the Airy disk caused by diffraction, as stars are too distant for their physical disks to be detected telescopically), but Marius interpreted them to be physical disks, like the planetary disks visible through a telescope. He concluded that since he could see stellar disks, the stars could not be as distant as was required in the Copernican world system, and he said that the appearance of the stars as seen through a telescope actually argued against Copernicus. These findings are contrasting to those of Galileo, who utilized similar telescopic data alternatively to support the Copernican world system. This adherence by Galileo to the Copernican heliocentric theory arises due to its apparent mathematical grandeur and his prior commitment to the theory. Marius, however, showed no evident commitment to any theory but rather hypothesized based on telescopic observation. He also concluded from his observations of the Galilean moons that they must orbit Jupiter while Jupiter orbits the Sun. Therefore, Marius concluded that the geocentric Tychonic system, in which the planets circle the Sun while the Sun circles the Earth, must be the correct world system, or model of the universe.

<text>The First Moroccan Crisis or the Tangier Crisis was an international crisis between March 31, 1905, and April 7, 1906, over the status of Morocco. Germany wanted to challenge France&#x27;s growing control over Morocco, aggravating France and Great Britain. The crisis was resolved by the Algeciras Conference of 1906, a conference of mostly European countries that affirmed French control; this worsened German relations with both France and Britain and helped enhance the new Anglo-French Entente.

== Kaiser&#x27;s visit ==
On 31 March 1905 Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany arrived at Tangier, Morocco and conferred with representatives of Sultan Abdelaziz of Morocco. The Kaiser toured the city on the back of a white horse. In a speech given at the German legation, the Kaiser declared he had come to support the sovereignty of the Sultan—a statement which amounted to a provocative challenge to French influence in Morocco. The Sultan subsequently rejected a set of French-proposed governmental reforms and issued invitations to major world powers to a conference which would advise him on necessary reforms.

== French response ==
Germany sought a multilateral conference where the French could be called to account before other European powers. The French foreign minister, Théophile Delcassé, took a defiant line, holding that there was no need for such a conference. In response, Count Bernhard von Bülow, the German Chancellor, threatened war over the issue, although this was a bluff. Kaiser Wilhelm did not want war, stating in Bremen just before he set off: &quot;My study of history hasn&#x27;t encouraged me to strive for world domination. In the empire of which I dream, the German emperor will be trusted by other countries and must be seen as a honest and peaceful neighbour&quot;. The crisis peaked in mid-June. The French cancelled all military leave (15 June) and Germany threatened to sign a defensive alliance with the Sultan (22 June). French Prime Minister Maurice Rouvier refused to risk war with Germany over the issue. Delcassé resigned, as the French government would no longer support his policy. On 1 July France agreed to attend the conference.

The crisis continued up to the eve of the conference at Algeciras, with Germany calling up reserve units (30 December) and France moving troops to the German border (3 January).

=== Algeciras Conference ===
The Algeciras Conference, lasting from 16 January to 7 April 1906, was called to settle the dispute. Of the 13 nations present, the German representatives found that their only supporter was Austria-Hungary. A German attempt at compromise was rejected by all but Austria-Hungary. France had firm support from Britain, Russia, Italy, Spain, and the United States. The Germans decided to accept a face-saving compromise agreement that was signed on 31 March 1906.

== Consequence ==
Although the Algeciras Conference temporarily solved the First Moroccan Crisis, it only worsened the tensions between the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente that ultimately led to the First World War.

The First Moroccan Crisis also showed that the Entente Cordiale was strong, as Britain had defended France in the crisis. The crisis can be seen as a reason for the Anglo-Russian Entente and the Anglo-Franco-Spanish Pact of Cartagena being signed the following year. Kaiser Wilhelm II was angry at being humiliated and was determined not to back down again, which led to the German involvement in the Second Moroccan Crisis.

<text>USS &quot;Kentucky&quot; (BB-66) was an uncompleted battleship intended to be the last ship of the . Hull BB-66 was originally to be the second ship of the s. However, the urgent need for more warships at the outbreak of World War II and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s experiences in the Pacific theater led it to conclude that rather than battleships larger and more heavily armed than the , it quickly needed more fast battleships of that class to escort the new s being built. As a result, hulls BB-65 and BB-66 were reordered and laid down as &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships in 1942.

As such, she was intended to be the sixth and final member of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class constructed. At the time of her construction she was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the U.S. state of Kentucky. Like her sister ship , laid down as one of the last pair of &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ahead of her, &quot;Kentucky&quot; was still under construction at the end of hostilities and became caught up in the post-war draw-down of the armed services. Her construction was suspended twice, during which times she served as a parts hulk. In the 1950s, several proposals were made to complete the ship as a guided missile battleship, abandoned primarily due to cost concerns and the rapid pace of evolving missile technology. &quot;Kentucky&quot; ultimately was sold for scrap in 1958.

== Background ==

&quot;Kentucky&quot; was conceived in 1935, when the United States Navy initiated design studies for the creation of an extended that was not restricted by the Second London Naval Treaty. This resulted in one of the &quot;fast battleship&quot; designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the Bureau of Construction and Repair.

The passage of the Second Vinson Act in 1938 had cleared the way for construction of the four &quot;South Dakota&quot;-class battleships and the first two &quot;Iowa&quot;-class fast battleships (those with the hull numbers BB-61 and BB-62). The latter four battleships of the class, those designated with the hull numbers BB-63, BB-64, BB-65, and BB-66 (&quot;Missouri&quot;, &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, &quot;Illinois&quot;, and &quot;Kentucky&quot;, respectively) were not cleared for construction until 12 July 1940. While BB-63 and BB-64 were originally planned as the final ships in the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class, BB-65 and BB-66 were intended to be the first ships of the &quot;Montana&quot; class which was larger and slower while mounting twelve Mark 7 guns. However, the passage of an emergency war building program on 19 July 1940 resulting in &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&quot; being re-ordered as the fifth and sixth ships, respectively, of the in order to save time on construction, so the first ship of the would be reassigned as BB-67. The orders for BB-65 and BB-66 were placed on 9 September 1940, and the ships were laid down on 6 December 1942, and 7 March 1942, respectively.

By 1942 the United States Navy shifted its building focus from battleships to aircraft carriers after the successes of carrier combat in both the Battle of the Coral Sea, and to a greater extent, the Battle of Midway. As a result, the construction of the US fleet of s had been given the highest priority for completion in the US shipyards by the US Navy. The &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers were proving vital to the war effort by enabling the Allies to gain and maintain air supremacy in the Pacific War, and were rapidly becoming the principal striking arm of the United States Navy in the ongoing effort to defeat the Empire of Japan. Accordingly, the United States accepted shortcomings in the armor of their s in favor of additional speed, which could steam at a comparable speed with the &quot;Essex&quot;-class and provide the carriers with the maximum amount of anti-aircraft protection. As a result, construction of the was canceled before their keels could be laid.

== Construction ==
&quot;Kentucky&quot;″s main battery would have consisted of nine /50 cal Mark 7 guns, which could hurl armor-piercing shells some . Her secondary battery would have consisted of 20 /38 cal guns arranged in 10 turrets, which could fire at targets up to away. With the advent of air power and the mandate to gain and maintain air superiority came a need to protect the growing fleet of Allied aircraft carriers. To this end, &quot;Kentucky&quot; was to be fitted with an array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns to defend allied carriers from enemy airstrikes.

Like &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships from &quot;Missouri&quot; (hull number BB-63) onwards, the frontal bulkhead armor was increased from the original to in order to better protect against fire from frontal sectors. Because the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class torpedo defense was virtually the same as the preceding &quot;South Dakota&quot;-class battleships it was proposed that &quot;Illinois&quot;″s and &quot;Kentucky&quot;″s hull be redesigned to provide a greater degree of torpedo protection for the battleship. Under the original construction schematics for the class each side of the ship was protected below the waterline by two tanks mounted outside the belt armor, and separated by a bulkhead. These tanks were initially planned to be empty, but in practice were filled with water or fuel oil. The armored belt tapered to a thickness of below the waterline. Behind the armored belt there was a void, and then another bulkhead. The outer hull was intended to detonate a torpedo, with the outer two compartments absorbing the shock and with any splinters or debris being stopped by the armored belt and the empty compartment behind it. In 1939 the Navy discovered that this system was less effective than the earlier torpedo defense system of the &quot;North Carolina&quot;-class due to the excessive rigidity of the lower belt armor causing leakage into adjacent compartments. Subsequently, the design of the torpedo defense system was modified for &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&quot;, such as eliminating knuckles along certain holding bulkheads; the intended construction format was estimated to provide up to 20% improvement to the torpedo defense of the battleship while simultaneously reducing flooding in the event of a torpedo strike.

&quot;Kentucky&quot;″s construction was plagued by suspensions. Her keel was laid down at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 7 March 1942. However, work on the ship was suspended in June that year, and &quot;Kentucky&quot;″s bottom structure was launched to make room for LST construction on 10 June. Work on the ship resumed on 6 December 1944, when the keel structure was moved to Dry Dock 8. Work on the battleship proceeded at a slow pace, and her completion was projected for the third quarter of 1946. In December 1945 it was recommended that &quot;Kentucky&quot; be completed as an anti-aircraft battleship, and work on the ship was suspended in August 1946 while this was considered. Construction resumed again on 17 August 1948 without any decision having been made on her final design. Work on &quot;Kentucky&quot; continued until 20 January 1950, when it was decided to halt work on the ship. Following this, she was floated out of her drydock to clear a space for repairs to sister ship , which had run aground en route from Hampton Roads.

== Conversion proposals ==

While her construction was suspended, the Bureau of Ships considered an aircraft carrier conversion proposal for &quot;Kentucky&quot; and &quot;Illinois&quot; in the aftermath of the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway. As proposed, the converted &quot;Kentucky&quot; would have had an long by wide flight deck, with armament identical to the carriers of the : four twin 5-inch gun mounts and four more 5-inch guns in single mounts, along with six 40 mm quadruple mounts. The idea was abandoned after the Bureau of Ships decided that the converted ships would carry fewer aircraft than the &quot;Essex&quot; class, that more &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers could be built in the same amount of time, and that the conversion project would be significantly more expensive than new &quot;Essex&quot;es. Instead, &quot;Kentucky&quot; and &quot;Illinois&quot; were to be completed as battleships, but their construction was given very low priority.

As early as 1946, missile conversion projects for &quot;Kentucky&quot; (project SCB 19) and the incomplete large cruiser were discussed. In the early 1950s, the advances in guided missile technology led to a proposal to create a large warship armed with both guns and missiles. To this end, the incomplete &quot;Kentucky&quot; was chosen for conversion from an all gun ship into a &quot;guided missile battleship&quot;. This proposal would have been relatively conservative, and would have involved the installation of a pair of twin arm launchers for the RIM-2 Terrier surface-to-air missile (SAM) on the aft deckhouse, with a pair of antennas for the associated AN/APG-55 pulse doppler interception radar installed forward of these, and the AN/SPS-2B air search radar on a short mast. Since the battleship was already approximately 73% complete (construction had been halted at the second deck), installation of the missile system and associated electronics would have involved only adding the necessary equipment without any need to rebuild the ship to accommodate the system. Some guided missile concepts included one or two launchers for eight SSM-N-9 Regulus II or SSM-N-2 Triton nuclear cruise missiles. The guided missile battleship project was authorized in 1954, and &quot;Kentucky&quot; was renumbered from BB-66 to BBG-1, with the conversion due to be complete in 1956. However, the project was soon cancelled, with the conversion ideas transferred to a smaller platform that led to the guided missile cruiser. These partial conversions of two heavy cruisers proved only partially successful in their new role, as the pace of change in cruise missile technology rendered their new weapons systems obsolete, while their remaining heavy guns proved in demand.

Another conversion project in early 1956 called for the installation of two Polaris nuclear ballistic missile launchers with a capacity for sixteen weapons. Also proposed were four RIM-8 Talos SAM launchers with eighty missiles per launcher and twelve RIM-24 Tartar SAM launchers with 504 missiles. A July 1956 estimate projected completing the ship by July 1961, but the cost of the conversion ultimately forced the Navy to abandon the project.

== Fate ==
&quot;Kentucky&quot; was never completed, instead serving as a parts hulk while in the mothball fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard from about 1950 to 1958. Hurricane Hazel hit the area on 15 October 1954, causing &quot;Kentucky&quot; to break free from her moorings and run aground in the Delaware River. In 1956, &quot;Kentucky&quot;″s bow was removed and used in the repair of , which had been damaged in a collision with the destroyer on 6 May 1956. Congressman William Huston Natcher attempted to block the sale of the ship by objecting to the bill in August 1957. Nevertheless, &quot;Kentucky&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 June 1958 and her incomplete hulk was sold for scrapping to Boston Metals Company of Baltimore, Maryland on 31 October for $1,176,666. She was towed to their shipyard in Baltimore in February 1959.

&quot;Kentucky&quot;″s four 600 psi (4.1 MPa) boilers and turbine sets were used to power the first two s, laid down in 1961 and in 1964. When the Navy switched to 1,200 psi (8.3 MPa) boilers, sailors who had served aboard &quot;Sacramento&quot; and &quot;Camden&quot; provided the experience to operate the older lower-pressure boilers aboard during her combat tour in the Vietnam War and aboard all four of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s when they were recalled and modernized in the 1980s as part of the 600-ship Navy plan. A pair of mahogany doors that had been donated by the state of Kentucky while the ship was under construction were removed and used in an officer&#x27;s club in New York City before eventually being returned to the Kentucky Historical Society in early January 1994.

<text>The Adverts were an English punk rock band formed in 1976 that existed until late 1979. They were one of the first punk bands to achieve mainstream success in the UK; their 1977 single &quot;Gary Gilmore&#x27;s Eyes&quot; reached No. 18 on the UK singles chart. &quot;The Virgin Encyclopedia of 70s Music&quot; described bassist and founding member Gaye Advert as the &quot;first female punk star&quot;.

==History==
The band was formed in 1976 by T. V. Smith (Tim Smith) and Gaye Advert (Gaye Black). Smith was from the town of Okehampton in mid-Devon, and Advert was from Bideford, a small coastal town in North Devon. After relocating to London, the two young punks recruited guitarist Howard Pickup (Boak) and drummer Laurie Driver (Muscat), and the Adverts were born.

The Roxy, London&#x27;s first live punk venue, played a crucial role in the Adverts&#x27; early career. They were one of the pioneering bands who played at the club during its first 100 days. The Adverts played at the club no fewer than nine times between January and April 1977. In January 1977, after their first gig supporting Generation X, the band impressed Michael Dempsey so much that he became their manager. Their second gig supporting Slaughter &amp; the Dogs was recorded, and their anthem &quot;Bored Teenagers&quot; was included on the 1977 UK Top 30 album &quot;The Roxy London WC2&quot;. In February, shortly after the band&#x27;s third gig supporting the Damned, they signed a recording contract with Stiff Records. In March, the band supported the Jam at the Roxy.

In April, the Adverts recorded the first of four sessions for John Peel at BBC Radio 1. Days later, on 29 April 1977, their debut single &quot;One Chord Wonders&quot; was released by Stiff. The single, &quot;a headlong rush of energy&quot;, was recommended by both &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot;. Understanding the band&#x27;s limitations, the song&#x27;s lyrics, composed by TV Smith, were likeably self-deprecating:
I wonder what we’ll play for you tonight
Something heavy or something light
Something to set your soul alight
I wonder how we’ll answer when you say
&#x27;We don’t like you – go away
Come back when you’ve learnt to play
The Adverts were a prolific live act. Their first nationwide tour was with Stiff labelmates the Damned. The tour poster read: &quot;The Damned can now play three chords, The Adverts can play one. Hear all four of them at...&quot; Later they would support Iggy Pop on tour, as well as conducting their own headlining tours in Britain, Ireland and continental Europe.

On 19 August 1977, the band released the first of their two UK Top 40 hit singles on Anchor Records. Lyrically, &quot;Gary Gilmore&#x27;s Eyes&quot; was a controversial song based on the wishes of Gary Gilmore, an American murderer, that his eyes be donated to medical science after his execution. &quot;Sounds&quot; described it as &quot;the sickest and cleverest record to come out of the new wave&quot;. It was later included in &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the best punk rock singles of all time.

After the tabloid-fueled controversy surrounding the single, and an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the Adverts became big news. Observers focused on frontman Smith and bassist Gaye Advert. Reviewers noted Smith&#x27;s songwriting ability. He was said to have &quot;captured the spirit of the times few contemporaries could match&quot;. Another reviewer described Smith as the band&#x27;s &quot;raging heart, spitting out the failsafe succession of songs which still delineate punk’s hopes, aspirations and, ultimately, regrets&quot;. In contrast, Gaye Advert&#x27;s reputation was more fleeting. She was &quot;one of punk’s first female icons&quot;. Her &quot;photogenic&quot; looks, &quot;panda-eye make-up and omnipresent leather jacket defined the face of female punkdom until well into the next decade&quot;.

The band&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;Safety in Numbers&quot;, was released on 28 October but did not chart. A fourth single, &quot;No Time to Be 21&quot;, issued on CBS subsidiary Bright Records on 20 January 1978, scraped into the UK Top 40.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Crossing the Red Sea&quot; was released by Bright on 17 February 1978. It has since become one of the most highly regarded albums of the punk era, with Dave Thompson calling it &quot;a devastating debut, one of the finest albums not only of the punk era, but of the 1970s as a whole&quot;, &quot;Trouser Press&quot; calling it &quot;the equal of the first Sex Pistols or Clash LP, a hasty statement that captures an exciting time&quot;, and several other writers including it in lists of all-time greatest albums.

Switching to RCA Records, the Adverts released three additional well-regarded singles, &quot;Television&#x27;s Over&quot; on 10 November 1978, &quot;My Place&quot; on 1 June 1979 and &quot;Cast of Thousands&quot; on 19 October 1979, but were unable to maintain their momentum. Their career stalled after the release of their second album &quot;Cast of Thousands&quot;, issued by RCA on 12 October 1979. For that album, the lineup was augmented by drummer Rod Latter (replacing Driver) and keyboardist Tim Cross. Pickup and Latter were then replaced by Paul Martinez (guitar) and Rick Martinez (drums).

Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, the band were threatened with lawsuits by former members Pickup and Latter, who objected to the band continuing to use the Adverts name without them. They split up shortly after the accidental death by electrocution of manager Dempsey. Their last gig was at Slough College on 27 October 1979. After the band ended, T.V. Smith continued with Cross as T.V. Smith&#x27;s Explorers, then Cheap, and finally as a solo artist from the 1990s onward.

In regards to their legacy, critic and author Dave Thompson argued that &quot;nobody would make music like the Adverts and nobody ever has. In terms of lyric, delivery, commitment and courage, they were, and they remain, the finest British group of the late 1970s&quot;.

Former members who have died include Cross (died 9 July 2012) and Pickup (died 11 July 1997).

<text>Idolatry is the worship of an idol as though it were a deity. In Abrahamic religions (namely Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, Islam, and the Baháʼí Faith) idolatry connotes the worship of something or someone other than the Abrahamic God as if it were God. In these monotheistic religions, idolatry has been considered as the &quot;worship of false gods&quot; and is forbidden by texts such as the Ten Commandments. Other monotheistic religions may apply similar rules.

For instance, the phrase &quot;false god&quot; is a derogatory term used in Abrahamic religions to indicate cult images or deities of non-Abrahamic Pagan religions, as well as other competing entities or objects to which particular importance is attributed. Conversely, followers of animistic and polytheistic religions may regard the gods of various monotheistic religions as &quot;false gods&quot; because they do not believe that any real deity possesses the properties ascribed by monotheists to their sole deity. Atheists, who do not believe in any deities, do not usually use the term &quot;false god&quot; even though that would encompass all deities from the atheist viewpoint. Usage of this term is generally limited to theists, who choose to worship some deity or deities, but not others.

In many Indian religions, which include Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, idols (&quot;murti&quot;) are considered as symbolism for the absolute but not the Absolute, or icons of spiritual ideas, or the embodiment of the divine. It is a means to focus one&#x27;s religious pursuits and worship (&quot;bhakti&quot;). In the traditional religions of Ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, Africa, Asia, the Americas and elsewhere, the reverence of cult images or statues has been a common practice since antiquity, and idols have carried different meanings and significance in the history of religion. Moreover, the material depiction of a deity or more deities has always played an eminent role in all cultures of the world.

The opposition to the use of any icon or image to represent ideas of reverence or worship is called aniconism. The destruction of images as icons of veneration is called iconoclasm, and this has long been accompanied with violence between religious groups that forbid idol worship and those who have accepted icons, images and statues for veneration. The definition of idolatry has been a contested topic within Abrahamic religions, with many Muslims and most Protestant Christians condemning the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox practice of venerating the Virgin Mary in many churches as a form of idolatry.

The history of religions has been marked with accusations and denials of idolatry. These accusations have considered statues and images to be devoid of symbolism. Alternatively, the topic of idolatry has been a source of disagreements between many religions, or within denominations of various religions, with the presumption that icons of one&#x27;s own religious practices have meaningful symbolism, while another person&#x27;s different religious practices do not.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The term &quot;idolatry&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word &quot;eidololatria&quot; (), which itself is a compound of two words: &quot;eidolon&quot; ( &quot;image/idol&quot;) and &quot;latreia&quot; (λατρεία &quot;worship&quot;, related to ). The word &quot;eidololatria&quot; thus means &quot;worship of idols&quot;, which in Latin appears first as &quot;idololatria&quot;, then in Vulgar Latin as &quot;idolatria&quot;, therefrom it appears in 12th century Old French as &quot;idolatrie&quot;, which for the first time in mid 13th century English appears as &quot;idolatry&quot;.

Although the Greek appears to be a loan translation of the Hebrew phrase &quot;avodat elilim&quot;, (עבודת אלילים) which is attested in rabbinic literature (e.g., bChul., 13b, Bar.), the Greek term itself is not found in the Septuagint, Philo, Josephus, or in other Hellenistic Jewish writings. The original term used in early rabbinic writings is &quot;oved avodah zarah&quot; (&quot;AAZ&quot;, worship in strange service, or &quot;pagan&quot;), while &quot;avodat kochavim umazalot&quot; (&quot;AKUM&quot;, worship of planets and constellations) is not found in its early manuscripts. The later Jews used the term , &quot;avodah zarah&quot;, meaning &quot;foreign worship&quot;.

Idolatry has also been called idolism, iconolatry or idolodulia in historic literature.

==Prehistoric and ancient civilizations==
The earliest so-called Venus figurines have been dated to the prehistoric Upper Paleolithic era (35–40 ka onwards). Archaeological evidence from the islands of the Aegean Sea have yielded Neolithic era Cycladic figures from 4th and 3rd millennium BC, idols in &quot;namaste&quot; posture from Indus Valley civilization sites from the 3rd millennium BC, and much older petroglyphs around the world show humans began producing sophisticated images. However, because of a lack of historic texts describing these, it is unclear what, if any connection with religious beliefs, these figures had, or whether they had other meaning and uses, even as toys.

The earliest historic records confirming idols are from the ancient Egyptian civilization, thereafter related to the Greek civilization. By the 2nd millennium BC two broad forms of cult image appear, in one images are zoomorphic (god in the image of animal or animal-human fusion) and in another anthropomorphic (god in the image of man). The former is more commonly found in ancient Egypt influenced beliefs, while the anthropomorphic images are more commonly found in Indo-European cultures. Symbols of nature, useful animals or feared animals may also be included by both. The stelae from 4,000 to 2,500 BC period discovered in France, Ireland through Ukraine, and in Central Asia through South Asia, suggest that the ancient anthropomorphic figures included zoomorphic motifs. In Nordic and Indian subcontinent, bovine (cow, ox, -*gwdus, -*g&#x27;ou) motifs or statues, for example, were common. In Ireland, iconic images included pigs.

The Ancient Egyptian religion was polytheistic, with large idols that were either animals or included animal parts. Ancient Greek civilization preferred human forms, with idealized proportions, for divine representation. The Canaanites of West Asia incorporated a golden calf into their pantheon.

The ancient philosophy and practices of the Greeks, thereafter Romans, were imbued with polytheistic idolatry. They debate what is an image and if the use of image is appropriate. To Plato, images can be a remedy or poison to the human experience. To Aristotle, states Paul Kugler, an image is an appropriate mental intermediary that &quot;bridges between the inner world of the mind and the outer world of material reality&quot;, the image is a vehicle between sensation and reason. Idols are useful psychological catalysts, they reflect sense data and pre-existing inner feelings. They are neither the origins nor the destinations of thought but the intermediary in the human inner journey. Fervid opposition to the idolatry of the Greeks and Romans was of Early Christianity and later Islam, as evidenced by the widespread desecration and defacement of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures that have survived into the modern era.

==Abrahamic religions==

===Judaism===

Judaism prohibits any form of idolatry even if they are used to worship the one God of Judaism as occurred during the sin of the golden calf. According to the second word of the decalogue, Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. The worship of foreign gods in any form or through icons is not allowed.

Many Jewish scholars such as Rabbi Saadia Gaon, Rabbi Bahya ibn Paquda, and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi have elaborated on the issues of idolatry. One of the oft-cited discussions is the commentary of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) on idolatry. According to the Maimonidean interpretation, idolatry in itself is not a fundamental sin, but the grave sin is the denial of God&#x27;s omnipresence that occurs with the belief that God can be corporeal. In the Jewish belief, the only image of God is man, one who lives and thinks; God has no visible shape, and it is absurd to make or worship images; instead man must worship the invisible God alone.

The commandments in the Hebrew Bible against idolatry forbade the practices and gods of ancient Akkad, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. The Hebrew Bible states that God has no shape or form, is utterly incomparable, is everywhere and cannot be represented in a physical form of an idol.

Biblical scholars have historically focused on the textual evidence to construct the history of idolatry in Judaism, a scholarship that post-modern scholars have increasingly begun deconstructing. This biblical polemics, states Naomi Janowitz, a professor of Religious Studies, has distorted the reality of Israelite religious practices and the historic use of images in Judaism. The direct material evidence is more reliable, such as that from the archaeological sites, and this suggests that the Jewish religious practices have been far more complex than what biblical polemics suggest. Judaism included images and cultic statues in the First Temple period, the Second Temple period, Late Antiquity (2nd to 8th century CE), and thereafter. Nonetheless, these sorts of evidence may be simply descriptive of Ancient Israelite practices in some—possibly deviant—circles, but cannot tell us anything about the mainstream religion of the Bible which proscribes idolatry.

The history of Jewish religious practice has included idols and figurines made of ivory, terracotta, faience and seals. As more material evidence emerged, one proposal has been that Judaism oscillated between idolatry and iconoclasm. However, the dating of the objects and texts suggest that the two theologies and liturgical practices existed simultaneously. The claimed rejection of idolatry because of monotheism found in Jewish literature and therefrom in biblical Christian literature, states Janowitz, has been unreal abstraction and flawed construction of the actual history. The material evidence of images, statues and figurines taken together with the textual description of cherub and &quot;wine standing for blood&quot;, for example, suggests that symbolism, making religious images, icon and index has been integral part of Judaism. Every religion has some objects that represent the divine and stand for something in the mind of the faithful, and Judaism too has had its holy objects and symbols such as Torah scrolls and holy books, Tefillin, the Menorah, mezuzah and many more.

===Christianity===

Ideas on idolatry in Christianity are based on the first of Ten Commandments. 
This is expressed in the Bible in Exodus 20:3, Matthew 4:10, Luke 4:8 and elsewhere, e.g.:
The Christian view of idolatry may generally be divided into two general categories: the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox view which accepts the use of religious images, and the views of many Protestant churches that considerably restrict their use. However, many Protestants have used the image of the cross as a symbol.

====Catholicism====

The Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church have traditionally defended the use of icons. The debate on what images signify and whether reverence with the help of icons in church is equivalent to idolatry has lasted for many centuries, particularly from the 7th century until the Reformation in the 16th century. These debates have supported the inclusion of icons of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the Apostles, the iconography expressed in stained glass, regional saints and other symbols of Christian faith. It has also supported the practices such as the Catholic mass, burning of candles before pictures, Christmas decorations and celebrations, and festive or memorial processions with statues of religious significance to Christianity.

St. John of Damascus, in his &quot;On the Divine Image&quot;, defended the use of icons and images, in direct response to the Byzantine iconoclasm that began widespread destruction of religious images in the 8th century, with support from emperor Leo III and continued by his successor Constantine V during a period of religious war with the invading Umayyads. John of Damascus wrote, &quot;I venture to draw an image of the invisible God, not as invisible, but as having become visible for our sakes through flesh and blood&quot;, adding that images are expressions &quot;for remembrance either of wonder, or an honor, or dishonor, or good, or evil&quot; and that a book is also a written image in another form. He defended the religious use of images based on the Christian doctrine of Jesus as an incarnation.

St. John the Evangelist cited John 1:14, stating that &quot;the Word became flesh&quot; indicates that the invisible God became visible, that God&#x27;s glory manifested in God&#x27;s one and only Son as Jesus Christ, and therefore God chose to make the invisible into a visible form, the spiritual incarnated into the material form.
The early defense of images included exegesis of Old and New Testament. Evidence for the use of religious images is found in Early Christian art and documentary records. For example, the veneration of the tombs and statues of martyrs was common among early Christian communities. In 397 St. Augustine of Hippo, in his Confessions 6.2.2, tells the story of his mother making offerings for the tombs of martyrs and the oratories built in the memory of the saints.

The Catholic defense mentions textual evidence of external acts of honor towards icons, arguing that there are a difference between adoration and veneration and that the veneration shown to icons differs entirely from the adoration of God. Citing the Old Testament, these arguments present examples of forms of &quot;veneration&quot; such as in Genesis 33:3, with the argument that &quot;adoration is one thing, and that which is offered in order to venerate something of great excellence is another&quot;. These arguments assert, &quot;the honor given to the image is transferred to its prototype&quot;, and that venerating an image of Christ does not terminate at the image itself – the material of the image is not the object of worship – rather it goes beyond the image, to the prototype.

According to the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;:


It also points out the following:
The manufacture of images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and Christian saints, along with prayers directed to these has been widespread among the Catholic faithful.

====Orthodox Church====
The Eastern Orthodox Church has differentiated between &quot;latria&quot; and &quot;dulia&quot;. A &quot;latria&quot; is the worship due God, and &quot;latria&quot; to anyone or anything other than God is doctrinally forbidden by the Orthodox Church; however &quot;dulia&quot; has been defined as veneration of religious images, statues or icons which is not only allowed but obligatory. This distinction was discussed by Thomas Aquinas in section 3.25 of &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot;.
In Orthodox apologetic literature, the proper and improper use of images is extensively discussed. Exegetical Orthodox literature points to icons and the manufacture by Moses (under God&#x27;s commandment) of the Bronze Snake in Numbers 21:9, which had the grace and power of God to heal those bitten by real snakes. Similarly, the Ark of the Covenant was cited as evidence of the ritual object above which Yahweh was present.

Veneration of icons through &quot;proskynesis&quot; was codified in 787 AD by the Seventh Ecumenical Council. This was triggered by the Byzantine Iconoclasm controversy that followed raging Christian-Muslim wars and a period of iconoclasm in West Asia. The defense of images and the role of the Syrian scholar John of Damascus was pivotal during this period. The Eastern Orthodox Church has ever since celebrated the use of icons and images. Eastern Rite Catholics also accepts icons in their Divine Liturgy.

====Protestantism====
The idolatry debate has been one of the defining differences between papal Catholicism and anti-papal Protestantism. The anti-papal writers have prominently questioned the worship practices and images supported by Catholics, with many Protestant scholars listing it as the &quot;one religious error larger than all others&quot;. The sub-list of erring practices have included among other things the veneration of Virgin Mary, the Catholic mass, the invocation of saints, and the reverence expected for and expressed to pope himself. The charges of supposed idolatry against the Roman Catholics were leveled by a diverse group of Protestants, from Anglicans to Calvinists in Geneva.
Protestants did not abandon all icons and symbols of Christianity. They typically avoid the use of images, except the cross, in any context suggestive of veneration. The cross remained their central icon. Technically both major branches of Christianity have had their icons, states Carlos Eire, a professor of religious studies and history, but its meaning has been different to each and &quot;one man&#x27;s devotion was another man&#x27;s idolatry&quot;. This was particularly true not only in the intra-Christian debate, states Eire, but also when soldiers of Catholic kings replaced &quot;horrible Aztec idols&quot; in the American colonies with &quot;beautiful crosses and images of Mary and the saints&quot;.

Protestants often accuse Catholics of idolatry, iconolatry, and even paganism; in the Protestant Reformation such language was common to all Protestants. In some cases, such as the Puritan groups denounced all forms of religious objects, regardless of whether it was a statue or sculpture, or image, including the Christian cross. The Waldensians were accused of idolatry by inquisitors.

The body of Christ on the cross is an ancient symbol used within the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran Churches, in contrast with some Protestant groups, which use only a simple cross. In Judaism, the reverence to the icon of Christ in the form of cross has been seen as idolatry. However, some Jewish scholars disagree and consider Christianity to be based on Jewish belief and not truly idolatrous.

===Islam===

In Islamic sources, the concept of &quot;shirk&quot; (triliteral root: &quot;sh-r-k&quot;) can refer to &quot;idolatry&quot;, though it is most widely used to denote &quot;association of partners with God&quot;. The concept of &quot;Kufr&quot; (k-f-r) can also include idolatry (among other forms of disbelief). The one who practices &quot;shirk&quot; is called &quot;mushrik&quot; (plural &quot;mushrikun&quot;) in the Islamic scriptures. The Quran forbids idolatry. Over 500 mentions of &quot;kufr&quot; and &quot;shirk&quot; are found in the Quran, and both concepts are strongly forbidden.

The Islamic concept of idolatry extends beyond polytheism, and includes some Christians and Jews as &quot;muširkūn&quot; (idolaters) and &quot;kafirun&quot; (infidels). For example:

Shia classical theology differs in the concept of Shirk. According to Twelver theologians, the attributes and names of God have no independent and hypostatic existence apart from the being and essence of God. Any suggestion of these attributes and names being conceived of as separate is thought to entail polytheism. It would be even incorrect to say God knows by his knowledge which is in his essence but God knows by his knowledge which is his essence. Also God has no physical form and he is insensible. The border between theoretical Tawhid and Shirk is to know that every reality and being in its essence, attributes and action are from him (from Him-ness), it is Tawhid. Every supernatural action of the prophets is by God&#x27;s permission as Quran points to it. The border between the Tawhid and Shirk in practice is to assume something as an end in itself, independent from God, not as a road to God (to Him-ness). Ismailis go deeper into the definition of &quot;Shirk&quot;, declaring they don&#x27;t recognize any sort of &quot;ground of being&quot; by the esoteric potential to have intuitive knowledge of the human being. Hence, most Shias have no problem with religious symbols and artworks, and with reverence for Walis, Rasūls and Imams.

Islam strongly prohibits all form of idolatry, which is part of the sin of &quot;shirk&quot; (); &quot;širk&quot; comes from the Arabic root Š-R-K (), with the general meaning of &quot;to share&quot;. In the context of the Qur&#x27;an, the particular sense of &quot;sharing as an equal partner&quot; is usually understood as &quot;attributing a partner to Allah&quot;. &quot;Shirk&quot; is often translated as idolatry and polytheism. In the Qur&#x27;an, &quot;shirk&quot; and the related word (plural Stem IV active participle) &quot;mušrikūn&quot; (مشركون) &quot;those who commit shirk&quot; refers to the enemies of Islam (as in verse 9.1–15).

Within Islam, &quot;shirk&quot; is sin that can only be forgiven if the person who commits it asks God for forgiveness; if the person who committed it dies without repenting God may forgive any sin except for committing &quot;shirk&quot;. In practice, especially among strict conservative interpretations of Islam, the term has been greatly extended and means deification of anyone or anything other than the singular God. In Salafi-Wahhabi interpretation, it may be used very widely to describe behaviour that does not literally constitute worship, including use of images of sentient beings, building a structure over a grave, associating partners with God, giving his characteristics to others beside him, or not believing in his characteristics. 19th century Wahhabis regarded idolatry punishable with the death penalty, a practice that was &quot;hitherto unknown&quot; in Islam. However, Classical Orthodox Sunni thought used to be rich in Relics and Saint veneration, as well as pilgrimage to their shrines. Ibn Taymiyya, a medieval theologian that influenced modern days Salafists, was put in prison for his negation of veneration of relics and Saints, as well as pilgrimage to Shrines, which was considered unorthodox by his contemporary theologians.

According to Islamic tradition, over the millennia after Ishmael&#x27;s death, his progeny and the local tribes who settled around the oasis of Zam-Zam gradually turned to polytheism and idolatry. Several idols were placed within the Kaaba representing deities of different aspects of nature and different tribes. Several heretical rituals were adopted in the Pilgrimage (&quot;Hajj&quot;) including doing naked circumambulation.

In her book, &quot;Islam: A Short History&quot;, Karen Armstrong asserts that the Kaaba was officially dedicated to Hubal, a Nabatean deity, and contained 360 idols that probably represented the days of the year. But by Muhammad&#x27;s day, it seems that the Kaaba was venerated as the shrine of Allah, the High God. Allah was never represented by an idol. Once a year, tribes from all around the Arabian peninsula, whether Christian or pagan, would converge on Mecca to perform the &quot;Hajj&quot;, marking the widespread conviction that Allah was the same deity worshipped by monotheists. Guillaume in his translation of Ibn Ishaq, an early biographer of Muhammad, says the Ka&#x27;aba might have been itself addressed using a feminine grammatical form by the Quraysh. Circumambulation was often performed naked by men and almost naked by women. It is disputed whether al-Lat and Hubal were the same deity or different. Per a hypothesis by Uri Rubin and Christian Robin, Hubal was only venerated by Quraysh and the Kaaba was first dedicated to al-Lat, a supreme god of individuals belonging to different tribes, while the pantheon of the gods of Quraysh was installed in Kaaba after they conquered Mecca a century before Muhammad&#x27;s time.

==Indian religions==

===Provenance===
The first attested date in peer-reviewed academic literature for the worship of murti (Sanskrit) or vigraha (Sanskrit) in India is not clear, as different sources have different opinions and interpretations. However, the Indus Valley Civilization (circa 2500 - 1500 BCE) may have produced some of the earliest murtis or vigrahas in India, as evidenced by various terracotta and bronze figurines found in the archaeological sites. Some of these figurines have been interpreted as representations of deities, such as the so-called Pashupati seal, which depicts a horned figure surrounded by animals and possibly identified with Shiva. Another example is the bronze statuette of a Dancing Girl, which some scholars have associated with Parvati or Shakti. However, these interpretations are not universally accepted, and some scholars have argued that the Indus Valley Civilization did not practice murti or vigraha worship, but rather used symbols and signs to express their religious beliefs.

The Vedic period (circa 1500 - 500 BCE) is traditionally considered as the origin of Hinduism proper, but it also did not emphasize murti or vigraha worship, as the Vedic religion was mainly focused on fire sacrifices and hymns to various gods and goddesses. However, some Vedic texts do mention the use of clay or wooden images for ritual purposes, such as the Shatapatha Brahmana (circa 8th - 6th century BCE), which describes how a clay image of Prajapati (the creator god) was made and consecrated for the agnicayana ritual. Another example, is the Aitareya Brahmana (circa 8th - 6th century BCE), which mentions how a wooden image of Varuna (the god of water and law) was installed in a temple and worshipped by the king. These examples suggest that murti or vigraha worship was not unknown in the Vedic period, but it was not widespread nor dominant.

The post-Vedic period (circa 500 BCE - 300 CE) witnessed the emergence and development of various religious movements and schools, such as Buddhism, Jainism, Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism and others. This period also saw the rise of murti or vigraha worship as a prominent feature of Hinduism, as evidenced by various literary and archaeological sources. For instance, the Ramayana (circa 5th - 4th century BCE) and the Mahabharata (circa 4th - 3rd century BCE) contain several references to murti or vigraha worship, such as Rama worshipping a Shiva linga at Rameshwaram, or Krishna installing an image of Vishnu at Dwarka. Another example, is the Buddhist text Lalitavistara Sutra (circa 3rd century BCE - 3rd century CE), which mentions how Buddha&#x27;s mother Maya dreamt of a white elephant entering her womb, and how King Suddhodana made an image of this elephant and worshipped it. Moreover, many stone and metal sculptures of various deities and saints have been found from this period onwards, such as the famous Pancha Rathas at Mahabalipuram (circa 7th century CE), which depict five chariots dedicated to different gods and goddesses.

===General===

The oldest forms of the ancient religions of India apparently made no use of idols. While the Vedic literature leading up to Hinduism is extensive, in the form of Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads, and has been dated to have been composed over a period of centuries (1200 BC to 200 BC), historical Vedic religion appears not to have used idols up to around 500 BC at least. The early Buddhist and Jain (pre-200 BC) traditions suggest no evidence of idolatry. The Vedic literature mentions many gods and goddesses, as well as the use of Homa (votive ritual using fire), but it does not mention images or their worship. The ancient Buddhist, Hindu and Jaina texts discuss the nature of existence, whether there is or is not a creator deity such as in the Nasadiya Sukta of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, they describe meditation, they recommend the pursuit of simple monastic life and self-knowledge, they debate the nature of absolute reality as Brahman or Śūnyatā, yet the ancient Indian texts mention no use of images. Indologists such as the Max Muller, Jan Gonda, Pandurang Vaman Kane, Ramchandra Narayan Dandekar, Horace Hayman Wilson, Stephanie Jamison and other scholars state that &quot;there is no evidence for icons or images representing god(s)&quot; in the ancient religions of India. Use of idols developed among the Indian religions later, perhaps first in Buddhism, where large images of the Buddha appear by the 1st century AD.

According to John Grimes, a professor of Indian philosophy, Indian thought denied even dogmatic idolatry of its scriptures. Everything has been left to challenge, arguments and enquiry, with the medieval Indian scholar Vācaspati Miśra stating that not all scripture is authoritative, only scripture which &quot;reveals the identity of the individual self and the supreme self as the non-dual Absolute&quot;.

===Buddhism===

According to Eric Reinders, icons and idolatry have been an integral part of Buddhism throughout its later history. Buddhists, from Korea to Vietnam, Thailand to Tibet, Central Asia to South Asia, have long produced temples and idols, altars and malas, relics to amulets, images to ritual implements. The images or relics of Buddha are found in all Buddhist traditions, but they also feature gods and goddesses such as those in Tibetan Buddhism.

Bhakti (called &quot;Bhatti&quot; in Pali) has been a common practice in Theravada Buddhism, where offerings and group prayers are made to Cetiya and particularly images of Buddha. Karel Werner notes that Bhakti has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and states, &quot;there can be no doubt that deep devotion or &quot;bhakti / bhatti&quot; does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days&quot;.

According to Peter Harvey – a professor of Buddhist Studies, Buddha idols and idolatry spread into northwest Indian subcontinent (now Pakistan and Afghanistan) and into Central Asia with Buddhist Silk Road merchants. The Hindu rulers of different Indian dynasties patronized both Buddhism and Hinduism from 4th to 9th century, building Buddhist icons and cave temples such as the Ajanta Caves and Ellora Caves which featured Buddha idols. From the 10th century, states Harvey, the raids into northwestern parts of South Asia by Muslim Turks destroyed Buddhist idols, given their religious dislike for idolatry. The iconoclasm was so linked to Buddhism, that the Islamic texts of this era in India called all idols as &quot;Budd&quot;. The desecration of idols in cave temples continued through the 17th century, states Geri Malandra, from the offense of &quot;the graphic, anthropomorphic imagery of Hindu and Buddhist shrines&quot;.

In East Asia and Southeast Asia, worship in Buddhist temples with the aid of icons and sacred objects has been historic. In Japanese Buddhism, for example, &quot;Butsugu&quot; (sacred objects) have been integral to the worship of the Buddha (&quot;kuyo&quot;), and such idolatry considered a part of the process of realizing one&#x27;s Buddha nature. This process is more than meditation, it has traditionally included devotional rituals (&quot;butsudo&quot;) aided by the Buddhist clergy. These practices are also found in Korea and China.

===Hinduism===

In Hinduism, an icon, image or statue is called &quot;murti&quot; or &quot;pratima&quot;. Major Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism favor the use of a &quot;murti&quot; (idol). These traditions suggest that it is easier to dedicate time and focus on spirituality through anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic icons. The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; – a Hindu scripture, in verse 12.5, states that only a few have the time and mind to ponder and fix on the unmanifested Absolute (abstract formless Brahman), and it is much easier to focus on qualities, virtues, aspects of a manifested representation of god, through one&#x27;s senses, emotions and heart, because the way human beings naturally are.

A &quot;murti&quot; in Hinduism, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Religious Studies specializing on Indian Religions, is itself not god, it is an &quot;image of god&quot; and thus a symbol and representation. A &quot;murti&quot; is a form and manifestation, states Fowler, of the formless Absolute. Thus a literal translation of &quot;murti&quot; as idol is incorrect, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself. Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a &quot;murti&quot; is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer. When a person worships a &quot;murti&quot;, it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper&#x27;s spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality – called Brahman in Hinduism – is not confined in it.

Devotional (&quot;bhakti movement&quot;) practices centered on cultivating a deep and personal bond of love with God, often expressed and facilitated with one or more murti, and includes individual or community hymns, japa or singing (&quot;bhajan&quot;, &quot;kirtana,&quot; or &quot;arati&quot;). Acts of devotion, in major temples particularly, are structured on treating the &quot;murti&quot; as the manifestation of a revered guest, and the daily routine can include awakening the &quot;murti&quot; in the morning and making sure that it &quot;is washed, dressed, and garlanded.&quot;

In Vaishnavism, the building of a temple for the &quot;murti&quot; is considered an act of devotion, but non-murti symbolism is also common wherein the aromatic tulasi plant or &quot;shaligrama&quot; is an aniconic reminder of the spiritualism in Vishnu. In the Shaivism tradition of Hinduism, Shiva may be represented as a masculine idol, or half-man half woman Ardhanarishvara form, in an anicon linga-yoni form. The worship rituals associated with the &quot;murti&quot;, correspond to ancient cultural practices for a beloved guest, and the &quot;murti&quot; is welcomed, taken care of, and then requested to retire.

Christopher John Fuller states that an image in Hinduism cannot be equated with a deity and the object of worship is the divine whose power is inside the image, and the image is not the object of worship itself, Hindus believe everything is worthy of worship as it contains divine energy. The idols are neither random nor intended as superstitious objects, rather they are designed with embedded symbolism and iconographic rules which sets the style, proportions, the colors, the nature of items the images carry, their &quot;mudra&quot; and the legends associated with the deity. The &quot;Vāstusūtra Upaniṣad&quot; states that the aim of the &quot;murti&quot; art is to inspire a devotee towards contemplating the Ultimate Supreme Principle (Brahman). This text adds (abridged):
Some Hindu movements founded during the colonial era, such as the Arya Samaj and Satya Mahima Dharma reject idolatry.

===Jainism===

Devotional idolatry has been a prevalent ancient practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned Tirthankara (&quot;Jina&quot;) and human &quot;gurus&quot; have been venerated with offerings, songs and Āratī prayers. Like other major Indian religions, Jainism has premised its spiritual practices on the belief that &quot;all knowledge is inevitably mediated by images&quot; and human beings discover, learn and know what is to be known through &quot;names, images and representations&quot;. Thus, idolatry has been a part of the major sects of Jainism such as Digambara and Shvetambara. The earliest archaeological evidence of the idols and images in Jainism is from Mathura, and has been dated to be from the first half of the 1st millennium AD.

The creation of idols, their consecration, the inclusion of Jaina layperson in idols and temples of Jainism by the Jaina monks has been a historic practice. However, during the iconoclastic era of Islamic rule, between the 15th and 17th century, a Lonka sect of Jainism emerged that continued pursuing their traditional spirituality but without the Jaina arts, images and idols.

===Sikhism===
Sikhism is a monotheistic Indian religion, and Sikh temples are devoid of idols and icons for God. Yet, Sikhism strongly encourages devotion to God. Some scholars call Sikhism a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions.

In Sikhism, &quot;Nirguni Bhakti&quot; is emphasised – devotion to a divine without Gunas (qualities or form), but its scripture also accepts representations of God with formless (&quot;nirguni&quot;) and with form (&quot;saguni&quot;), as stated in Adi Granth 287. Sikhism condemns worshipping images or statues as if it were God, but have historically challenged the iconoclastic policies and Hindu temple destruction activities of Islamic rulers in India.
Sikhs house their scripture and revere the Guru Granth Sahib as the final Guru of Sikhism. It is installed in Sikh &quot;Gurdwara&quot; (temple), many Sikhs bow or prostrate before it on entering the gurdwara. Guru Granth Sahib is ritually installed every morning, and put to bed at night in many &quot;Gurdwaras&quot;.
In the Dasam Bani, Guru Gobind Singh wrote &quot;I am idol-breaker&quot; on line 95 of his Zafarnamah.

== Chinese and Sinosphere Traditions ==
=== Japan ===
In Japan, there are images of some kami (i.e. deities) such as those of Fūjin and Raijin at the Buddhist temple Sanjūsangen-dō.

=== North Korean Juche ===

Kim Il Sung instituted worship of himself amongst the citizens of North Korea, and this act is considered the only instance of a modern country deifying its ruler. As many citizens frequently bow before statues and portraits of him, scholars have considered the Juche state religion to be a form of idolatry.

== Traditional religions ==

===Africa===

Africa has numerous ethnic groups, and their diverse religious idea have been grouped as African Traditional Religions, sometimes abbreviated to ATR. These religions typically believe in a Supreme Being which goes by different regional names, as well as spirit world often linked to ancestors, and mystical magical powers through divination. Idols and their worship have been associated with all three components in the African Traditional Religions.

According to J.O. Awolalu, proselytizing Christians and Muslims have mislabelled idol to mean false god, when in the reality of most traditions of Africa, the object may be a piece of wood or iron or stone, yet it is &quot;symbolic, an emblem and implies the spiritual idea which is worshipped&quot;. The material objects may decay or get destroyed, the emblem may crumble or substituted, but the spiritual idea that it represents to the heart and mind of an African traditionalist remains unchanged. Sylvester Johnson – a professor of African American and Religious Studies, concurs with Awolalu, and states that the colonial era missionaries who arrived in Africa, neither understood the regional languages nor the African theology, and interpreted the images and ritualism as &quot;epitome of idolatry&quot;, projecting the iconoclastic controversies in Europe they grew up with, onto Africa.

First with the arrival of Islam in Africa, then during the Christian colonial efforts, the religiously justified wars, the colonial portrayal of idolatry as proof of savagery, the destruction of idols and the seizure of idolaters as slaves marked a long period of religious intolerance, which supported religious violence and demeaning caricature of the African Traditional Religionists. The violence against idolaters and idolatry of Traditional Religion practicers of Africa started in the medieval era and continued into the modern era. The charge of idolatry by proselytizers, state Michael Wayne Cole and Rebecca Zorach, served to demonize and dehumanize local African populations, and justify their enslavement and abuse locally or far off plantations, settlements or for forced domestic labor.

===Americas===

Statues, images and temples have been a part of the Traditional Religions of the indigenous people of the Americas. The Incan, Mayan and Aztec civilizations developed sophisticated religious practices that incorporated idols and religious arts. The Inca culture, for example, has believed in &quot;Viracocha&quot; (also called &quot;Pachacutec&quot;) as the creator deity and nature deities such as &quot;Inti&quot; (sun deity), and &quot;Mama Cocha&quot; the goddess of the sea, lakes, rivers and waters.
In Mayan culture, &quot;Kukulkan&quot; has been the supreme creator deity, also revered as the god of reincarnation, water, fertility and wind. The Mayan people built step pyramid temples to honor &quot;Kukulkan&quot;, aligning them to the Sun&#x27;s position on the spring equinox. Other deities found at Mayan archaeological sites include &quot;Xib Chac&quot; – the benevolent male rain deity, and &quot;Ixchel&quot; – the benevolent female earth, weaving and pregnancy goddess. A deity with aspects similar to &quot;Kulkulkan&quot; in the Aztec culture has been called &quot;Quetzalcoatl&quot;.

Missionaries came to the Americas with the start of Spanish colonial era, and the Catholic Church did not tolerate any form of native idolatry, preferring that the icons and images of Jesus and Mary replace the native idols. Aztec, for example, had a written history which included those about their Traditional Religion, but the Spanish colonialists destroyed this written history in their zeal to end what they considered as idolatry, and to convert the Aztecs to Catholicism. The Aztec Indians, however, preserved their religion and religious practices by burying their idols under the crosses, and then continuing their idol worship rituals and practices, aided by the syncretic composite of atrial crosses and their idols as before.

During and after the imposition of Catholic Christianity during Spanish colonialism, the Incan people retained their original beliefs in deities through syncretism, where they overlay the Christian God and teachings over their original beliefs and practices. The male deity &quot;Inti&quot; became accepted as the Christian God, but the Andean rituals centered around idolatry of Incan deities have been retained and continued thereafter into the modern era by the Incan people.

===Polynesia===
The Polynesian people have had a range of polytheistic theologies found across the Pacific Ocean. The Polynesian people produced idols from wood, and congregated around these idols for worship.

The Christian missionaries, particularly from the London Missionary Society such as John Williams, and others such as the Methodist Missionary Society, characterized these as idolatry, in the sense of islanders worshipping false gods. They sent back reports which primarily focussed on &quot;overthrow of pagan idolatry&quot; as evidence of their Christian sects triumph, with fewer mentions of actual converts and baptism.

==Religious tolerance and intolerance==
The term &quot;false god&quot; is often used throughout the Abrahamic scriptures (Torah, Tanakh, Bible, and Quran) to single out Yahweh (interpreted by Jews, Samaritans, and Christians) or Elohim/Allah (interpreted by Muslims) as the only true God. Nevertheless, the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament itself recognizes and reports that originally the Israelites were not monotheists but actively engaged in idolatry and worshipped many foreign, non-Jewish Gods besides Yahweh and/or instead of him, such as Baal, Astarte, Asherah, Chemosh, Dagon, Moloch, Tammuz, and more, and continued to do so until their return from the Babylonian exile (see Ancient Hebrew religion). Judaism, the oldest Abrahamic religion, eventually shifted into a strict, exclusive monotheism, based on the sole veneration of Yahweh, the predecessor to the Abrahamic conception of God.

The vast majority of religions in history have been and/or are still polytheistic, worshipping many diverse deities. Moreover, the material depiction of a deity or more deities has always played an eminent role in all cultures of the world. The claim to worship the &quot;one and only true God&quot; came to most of the world with the arrival of Abrahamic religions and is the distinguishing characteristic of their monotheistic worldview, whereas virtually all the other religions in the world have been and/or are still animistic and polytheistic. Some Neopagan religions such as Wicca utilize statues of deities within their worship experience.

The accusations and presumption that all idols and images are devoid of symbolism, or that icons of one&#x27;s own religion are &quot;true, healthy, uplifting, beautiful symbolism, mark of devotion, divine&quot;, while of other person&#x27;s religion are &quot;false, an illness, superstitious, grotesque madness, evil addiction, satanic, and cause of all incivility&quot; is more a matter of subjective personal interpretation, rather than objective impersonal truth. Regina Schwartz and some other contemporary scholars state allegations that idols only represent false gods, followed by iconoclastic destruction is only little more than religious intolerance. The Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume wrote in his essay &quot;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&quot; (1779) that the worship of different gods and idols in Pagan religions is premised on religious pluralism, tolerance, and acceptance of diverse representations of the divine. In contrast, Abrahamic monotheistic religions are intolerant, have attempted to destroy freedom of expression and have violently forced others to accept and worship their conception of God.

<text>In probability theory and statistics, a covariance matrix (also known as auto-covariance matrix, dispersion matrix, variance matrix, or variance–covariance matrix) is a square matrix giving the covariance between each pair of elements of a given random vector.

Intuitively, the covariance matrix generalizes the notion of variance to multiple dimensions. As an example, the variation in a collection of random points in two-dimensional space cannot be characterized fully by a single number, nor would the variances in the formula_1 and formula_2 directions contain all of the necessary information; a formula_3 matrix would be necessary to fully characterize the two-dimensional variation.

Any covariance matrix is symmetric and positive semi-definite and its main diagonal contains variances (i.e., the covariance of each element with itself).

The covariance matrix of a random vector formula_4 is typically denoted by formula_5, formula_6 or formula_7.

==Definition==
Throughout this article, boldfaced unsubscripted formula_4 and formula_9 are used to refer to random vectors, and Roman subscripted formula_10 and formula_11 are used to refer to scalar random variables.

If the entries in the column vector
formula_12
are random variables, each with finite variance and expected value, then the covariance matrix formula_5 is the matrix whose formula_14 entry is the covariance
formula_15
where the operator formula_16 denotes the expected value (mean) of its argument.

===Conflicting nomenclatures and notations===
Nomenclatures differ. Some statisticians, following the probabilist William Feller in his two-volume book &quot;An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications&quot;, call the matrix formula_5 the variance of the random vector formula_4, because it is the natural generalization to higher dimensions of the 1-dimensional variance. Others call it the covariance matrix, because it is the matrix of covariances between the scalar components of the vector formula_4.
formula_20

Both forms are quite standard, and there is no ambiguity between them. The matrix formula_5 is also often called the variance-covariance matrix, since the diagonal terms are in fact variances.

By comparison, the notation for the cross-covariance matrix &quot;between&quot; two vectors is 
formula_22

==Properties==
===Relation to the autocorrelation matrix===
The auto-covariance matrix formula_5 is related to the autocorrelation matrix formula_24 by
formula_25
where the autocorrelation matrix is defined as formula_26.

===Relation to the correlation matrix===

An entity closely related to the covariance matrix is the matrix of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients between each of the random variables in the random vector formula_4, which can be written as
formula_28
where formula_29 is the matrix of the diagonal elements of formula_5 (i.e., a diagonal matrix of the variances of formula_10 for formula_32).

Equivalently, the correlation matrix can be seen as the covariance matrix of the standardized random variables formula_33 for formula_32.
formula_35

Each element on the principal diagonal of a correlation matrix is the correlation of a random variable with itself, which always equals 1. Each off-diagonal element is between −1 and +1 inclusive.

===Inverse of the covariance matrix===
The inverse of this matrix, formula_36, if it exists, is the inverse covariance matrix (or inverse concentration matrix), also known as the &quot;precision matrix&quot; (or &quot;concentration matrix&quot;).

Just as the covariance matrix can be written as the rescaling of a correlation matrix by the marginal variances: 
formula_37

So, using the idea of partial correlation, and partial variance, the inverse covariance matrix can be expressed analogously:
formula_38
This duality motivates a number of other dualities between marginalizing and conditioning for Gaussian random variables.

===Basic properties===
For formula_39 and formula_40, where formula_41 is an formula_42-dimensional random variable, the following basic properties apply:
# formula_43
# formula_44 is positive-semidefinite, i.e. formula_45
 = \mathrm{cov}(\mathbf{X})&lt;/math&gt; by linear operator formula_46 s.a. formula_47, the covariation matrix is tranformed as
: formula_48.
As according to the property 3 matrix formula_49 is symmetric, it can be diagonalized by a linear orthogonal transformation, i.e. there exists such orthogonal matrix formula_46 (meanwhile formula_51), that
: formula_52
and formula_53 are eigenvalues of formula_49. But this means that this matrix is a covariation matrix for a random variable formula_47, and the main diagonal of formula_56 consists of variances of elements of formula_9 vector. As variance is always non-negative, we conclude that formula_58 for any formula_59. But this means that matrix formula_49 is positive-semidefinite.
# formula_44 is symmetric, i.e. formula_62
# For any constant (i.e. non-random) formula_63 matrix formula_46 and constant formula_65 vector formula_66, one has formula_67
# If formula_9 is another random vector with the same dimension as formula_4, then formula_70 where formula_71 is the cross-covariance matrix of formula_4 and formula_9.

=== Block matrices ===

The joint mean formula_74 and joint covariance matrix formula_75 of formula_4 and formula_9 can be written in block form
formula_78
where formula_79, formula_80 and formula_81.

formula_82 and formula_83 can be identified as the variance matrices of the marginal distributions for formula_84 and formula_85 respectively.

If formula_4 and formula_9 are jointly normally distributed,
formula_88
then the conditional distribution for formula_9 given formula_4 is given by
formula_91
defined by conditional mean
formula_92
and conditional variance
formula_93

The matrix formula_94 is known as the matrix of regression coefficients, while in linear algebra formula_95 is the Schur complement of formula_82 in formula_97.

The matrix of regression coefficients may often be given in transpose form, formula_98, suitable for post-multiplying a row vector of explanatory variables formula_99 rather than pre-multiplying a column vector formula_84. In this form they correspond to the coefficients obtained by inverting the matrix of the normal equations of ordinary least squares (OLS).

== Partial covariance matrix ==
A covariance matrix with all non-zero elements tells us that all the individual random variables are interrelated. This means that the variables are not only directly correlated, but also correlated via other variables indirectly. Often such indirect, common-mode correlations are trivial and uninteresting. They can be suppressed by calculating the partial covariance matrix, that is the part of covariance matrix that shows only the interesting part of correlations.

If two vectors of random variables formula_4 and formula_9 are correlated via another vector formula_103, the latter correlations are suppressed in a matrix
formula_104
The partial covariance matrix formula_105 is effectively the simple covariance matrix formula_106 as if the uninteresting random variables formula_103 were held constant.

== Standard deviation matrix ==
The standard deviation matrix formula_108 is the extension of the standard deviation to multiple dimensions. It is the symmetric square root of the covariance matrix formula_109. 

==Covariance matrix as a parameter of a distribution==
If a column vector formula_84 of formula_111 possibly correlated random variables is jointly normally distributed, or more generally elliptically distributed, then its probability density function formula_112 can be expressed in terms of the covariance matrix formula_113 as follows
formula_114
where formula_115 and formula_116 is the determinant of formula_113.

==Covariance matrix as a linear operator==

Applied to one vector, the covariance matrix maps a linear combination c of the random variables X onto a vector of covariances with those variables: formula_118. Treated as a bilinear form, it yields the covariance between the two linear combinations: formula_119. The variance of a linear combination is then formula_120, its covariance with itself.

Similarly, the (pseudo-)inverse covariance matrix provides an inner product formula_121, which induces the Mahalanobis distance, a measure of the &quot;unlikelihood&quot; of &quot;c&quot;.

==Which matrices are covariance matrices?==
From basic property 4. above, let formula_122 be a formula_123 real-valued vector, then
formula_124
which must always be nonnegative, since it is the variance of a real-valued random variable, so a covariance matrix is always a positive-semidefinite matrix.

The above argument can be expanded as follows:formula_125where the last inequality follows from the observation that formula_126 is a scalar.

Conversely, every symmetric positive semi-definite matrix is a covariance matrix. To see this, suppose formula_127 is a formula_128 symmetric positive-semidefinite matrix. From the finite-dimensional case of the spectral theorem, it follows that formula_127 has a nonnegative symmetric square root, which can be denoted by M1/2. Let formula_4 be any formula_131 column vector-valued random variable whose covariance matrix is the formula_128 identity matrix. Then
formula_133

==Complex random vectors==
The variance of a complex &quot;scalar-valued&quot; random variable with expected value formula_134 is conventionally defined using complex conjugation:
formula_135
where the complex conjugate of a complex number formula_136 is denoted formula_137; thus the variance of a complex random variable is a real number.

If formula_138 is a column vector of complex-valued random variables, then the conjugate transpose formula_139 is formed by &quot;both&quot; transposing and conjugating. In the following expression, the product of a vector with its conjugate transpose results in a square matrix called the covariance matrix, as its expectation:
formula_140
The matrix so obtained will be Hermitian positive-semidefinite, with real numbers in the main diagonal and complex numbers off-diagonal.

;Properties
* The covariance matrix is a Hermitian matrix, i.e. formula_141.
* The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are real.

===Pseudo-covariance matrix===
For complex random vectors, another kind of second central moment, the pseudo-covariance matrix (also called relation matrix) is defined as follows:
formula_142

In contrast to the covariance matrix defined above, Hermitian transposition gets replaced by transposition in the definition.
Its diagonal elements may be complex valued; it is a complex symmetric matrix.

==Estimation==

If formula_143 and formula_144 are centered data matrices of dimension formula_145 and formula_146 respectively, i.e. with &quot;n&quot; columns of observations of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; rows of variables, from which the row means have been subtracted, then, if the row means were estimated from the data, sample covariance matrices formula_147 and formula_148 can be defined to be
formula_149
or, if the row means were known a priori,
formula_150

These empirical sample covariance matrices are the most straightforward and most often used estimators for the covariance matrices, but other estimators also exist, including regularised or shrinkage estimators, which may have better properties.

==Applications==
The covariance matrix is a useful tool in many different areas. From it a transformation matrix can be derived, called a whitening transformation, that allows one to completely decorrelate the data or, from a different point of view, to find an optimal basis for representing the data in a compact way (see Rayleigh quotient for a formal proof and additional properties of covariance matrices).
This is called principal component analysis (PCA) and the Karhunen–Loève transform (KL-transform).

The covariance matrix plays a key role in financial economics, especially in portfolio theory and its mutual fund separation theorem and in the capital asset pricing model. The matrix of covariances among various assets&#x27; returns is used to determine, under certain assumptions, the relative amounts of different assets that investors should (in a normative analysis) or are predicted to (in a positive analysis) choose to hold in a context of diversification.

===Use in optimization===
The evolution strategy, a particular family of Randomized Search Heuristics, fundamentally relies on a covariance matrix in its mechanism. The characteristic mutation operator draws the update step from a multivariate normal distribution using an evolving covariance matrix. There is a formal proof that the evolution strategy&#x27;s covariance matrix adapts to the inverse of the Hessian matrix of the search landscape, up to a scalar factor and small random fluctuations (proven for a single-parent strategy and a static model, as the population size increases, relying on the quadratic approximation).
Intuitively, this result is supported by the rationale that the optimal covariance distribution can offer mutation steps whose equidensity probability contours match the level sets of the landscape, and so they maximize the progress rate.

===Covariance mapping===
In covariance mapping the values of the formula_151 or formula_152 matrix are plotted as a 2-dimensional map. When vectors formula_84 and formula_85 are discrete random functions, the map shows statistical relations between different regions of the random functions. Statistically independent regions of the functions show up on the map as zero-level flatland, while positive or negative correlations show up, respectively, as hills or valleys.

In practice the column vectors formula_155, and formula_156 are acquired experimentally as rows of formula_111 samples, e.g.
formula_158
where formula_159 is the &quot;i&quot;-th discrete value in sample &quot;j&quot; of the random function formula_160. The expected values needed in the covariance formula are estimated using the sample mean, e.g.
formula_161
and the covariance matrix is estimated by the sample covariance matrix
formula_162
where the angular brackets denote sample averaging as before except that the Bessel&#x27;s correction should be made to avoid bias. Using this estimation the partial covariance matrix can be calculated as
formula_163
where the backslash denotes the left matrix division operator, which bypasses the requirement to invert a matrix and is available in some computational packages such as Matlab.
Fig. 1 illustrates how a partial covariance map is constructed on an example of an experiment performed at the FLASH free-electron laser in Hamburg. The random function formula_160 is the time-of-flight spectrum of ions from a Coulomb explosion of nitrogen molecules multiply ionised by a laser pulse. Since only a few hundreds of molecules are ionised at each laser pulse, the single-shot spectra are highly fluctuating. However, collecting typically formula_165 such spectra, formula_166, and averaging them over formula_167 produces a smooth spectrum formula_168, which is shown in red at the bottom of Fig. 1. The average spectrum formula_169 reveals several nitrogen ions in a form of peaks broadened by their kinetic energy, but to find the correlations between the ionisation stages and the ion momenta requires calculating a covariance map.

In the example of Fig. 1 spectra formula_166 and formula_171 are the same, except that the range of the time-of-flight formula_172 differs. Panel a shows formula_173, panel b shows formula_174 and panel c shows their difference, which is formula_175 (note a change in the colour scale). Unfortunately, this map is overwhelmed by uninteresting, common-mode correlations induced by laser intensity fluctuating from shot to shot. To suppress such correlations the laser intensity formula_176 is recorded at every shot, put into formula_156 and formula_178 is calculated as panels d and e show. The suppression of the uninteresting correlations is, however, imperfect because there are other sources of common-mode fluctuations than the laser intensity and in principle all these sources should be monitored in vector formula_156. Yet in practice it is often sufficient to overcompensate the partial covariance correction as panel f shows, where interesting correlations of ion momenta are now clearly visible as straight lines centred on ionisation stages of atomic nitrogen.

===Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy===
Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy employs correlation analysis to obtain 2D spectra of the condensed phase. There are two versions of this analysis: synchronous and asynchronous. Mathematically, the former is expressed in terms of the sample covariance matrix and the technique is equivalent to covariance mapping.

<text>A mine plow (plough in British English) is a device designed to clear a lane through a minefield, allowing other vehicles to follow. A mine plow is typically mounted to a tank or military engineering vehicle. Buried land mines are plowed up and pushed outside the tank&#x27;s track path or tipped over. Since modern anti-tank mines rely on a focused explosion to destroy armored vehicles, they are useless when turned upside-down; as the tank runs over the mine, it will expend its blast down instead of upwards, causing insignificant damage, if any. 

==History==
Towards the end of the First World War, the French mounted a plow on their Renault FT tank. 

The British started work on plow designs in 1937, and a successful design was introduced for the Matilda Mk I tank though it was not used.

The first recorded combat use is by a &quot;Bullshorn&quot; plow on a Churchill tank of the British 79th Armoured Division, on Sword Beach during the Allied invasion of Normandy (this was one of &quot;Hobart&#x27;s Funnies&quot; specialized vehicles). The &quot;Bullshorn&quot; was one of a number of plow designs which were tested and used by the British Army.

The mine plow is still in use by many combat engineering units. The Royal Engineers have deployed the Trojan to Afghanistan where it was usually fitted with a plow on the front, which enables it to clear mines, either detonating them on contact, or pushing them out of the way to clear a safe channel for following vehicles.

<doc id="191756" wikidata="Q205194" url="?curid=191756" title="Grace in Christianity">
<text>In Western Christian beliefs, grace is God&#x27;s favor, and a &quot;share in the divine life of God&quot;. It is a spontaneous gift from God – &quot;generous, free and totally unexpected and undeserved&quot; – that cannot be earned. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, grace is the uncreated energies of God. Among Eastern Christians generally, grace is considered to be the partaking of the divine nature described in and grace is the working of God himself, not a created substance of any kind that can be treated like a commodity.

As an attribute of God, grace manifests most in the salvation of sinners, and Western Christianity holds that the initiative in the relationship of grace between God and an individual is always on the side of God.

The question of the means of grace has been called &quot;the watershed that divides Catholicism from Protestantism, Calvinism from Arminianism, modern theological liberalism from theological conservatism.&quot; The Catholic Church holds that it is because of the action of Christ and the Holy Spirit in transforming into the divine life what is subjected to God&#x27;s power that &quot;the sacraments confer the grace they signify&quot;: &quot;the power of Christ and his Spirit acts in and through [each sacrament], independently of the personal holiness of the minister. Nevertheless, the fruits of the sacraments also depend on the disposition of the one who receives them.&quot;

Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and Protestants agree that faith is a gift from God, as in : &quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.&quot; Lutherans hold that the means of grace are &quot;the gospel in Word and sacraments.&quot; That the sacraments are means of grace is also the teaching of John Wesley, who described the Eucharist as &quot;the grand channel whereby the grace of his Spirit was conveyed to the souls of all the children of God&quot;.

Calvinists emphasize &quot;the utter helplessness of people apart from grace.&quot; But God reaches out with &quot;first grace&quot; or &quot;prevenient grace&quot;. The Calvinist doctrine known as irresistible grace states that, since all persons are by nature spiritually dead, no one desires to accept this grace until God spiritually enlivens them by means of regeneration. God regenerates only individuals whom he has predestined to salvation. Arminians understand the grace of God as cooperating with one&#x27;s free will in order to bring an individual to salvation. According to Evangelical theologian Charles C. Ryrie, modern liberal theology &quot;gives an exaggerated place to the abilities of people to decide their own fate and to effect their own salvation entirely apart from God&#x27;s grace.&quot;

==Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible==
&quot;Grace&quot; is the English translation of the Greek () meaning &quot;that which brings delight, joy, happiness, or good fortune.&quot;

=== Old Testament ===
The Septuagint translates as the Hebrew word () as found in Genesis 6:8 to describe why God saved Noah from the flood. The Old Testament use of the word includes the concept that those showing favor do gracious deeds, or acts of grace, such as being kind to the poor and showing generosity. Descriptions of God&#x27;s graciousness abound in the Torah/Pentateuch, for example in Deuteronomy 7:8 and Numbers 6:24–27. In the Psalms, examples of God&#x27;s grace include teaching the Law (Psalm 119:29) and answering prayers (Psalm 27:7). Another example of God&#x27;s grace appears in Psalm 85, a prayer for restoration, forgiveness, and the grace and mercy of God to bring about new life following the Exile.

==Roman Catholicism==
In the definition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, &quot;grace is favour, the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God, adoptive sons, partakers of the divine nature and of eternal life&quot;. Grace is a participation in the life of God, which is poured unearned into human beings, whom it heals of sin and sanctifies.

The means by which God grants grace are many. They include the entirety of revealed truth, the sacraments and the hierarchical ministry. Among the principal means of grace are the sacraments (especially the Eucharist), prayers and good works. The sacramentals also are means of grace. The sacraments themselves, not the persons who administer or those who receive them, are &quot;the means of grace&quot;, although lack of the required dispositions on the part of the recipient will block the effectiveness of the sacrament.

The Catholic Church holds that &quot;by grace alone, in faith in Christ&#x27;s saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works.&quot; Both the Council of Orange (529) and the Council of Trent affirmed that we are &quot;justified gratuitously, because none of the things that precede justification, whether faith or works, merit the grace of justification&quot;.

The Council of Trent declared that the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam&#x27;s fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v).

The joint declaration between Catholics and Lutherans on the doctrine of justification affirms:

===Sanctifying and actual grace===
According to a commonly accepted categorization, made by St. Thomas Aquinas in his , grace can be given either to make the person receiving it pleasing to God () – so that the person is sanctified and justified – or else to help the receiver lead someone else to God (). The former type of grace, , in turn, can be described as sanctifying (or habitual) grace – when it refers to the divine life which, according to the Church, infuses a person&#x27;s soul once they are justified; or else as actual grace – when it refers to those punctual (not habitual) helps that are directed to the production of sanctifying grace where it does not already exist, or its maintenance and increase it where it is already present. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church:

The infusion of sanctifying grace, says the Church, transforms a sinner into a holy child of God, and in this way a person participates in the Divine Sonship of Jesus Christ and receives the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. For this reason, sanctifying grace is also called deifying grace and sanctification is deification. 

Sanctifying grace remains permanently in the soul as long as one does not reject one&#x27;s adopted sonship by committing a mortal sin, which severs one&#x27;s friendship with God. Less serious sins, venial sin, although they &quot;allow charity to subsist, they offend and wound it.&quot; However, God is infinitely merciful, and sanctifying grace can always be restored to the penitent heart, normatively in the Sacrament of Reconciliation (or Sacrament of Penance).

===Augustine versus Pelagius===

In the early 5th century, Pelagius, an ascetic who is said to have come from Britain, was concerned about the moral laxity of society that he witnessed in Rome. He blamed this laxity on the theology of divine grace preached by Augustine of Hippo, among others. He strongly affirmed that humans had free will and were able to choose good as well as evil. Augustine, drawing on the exaggerated statements of the followers of Pelagius rather than on Pelagius&#x27; own writings, began a debate that was to have long-reaching effects on subsequent developments of the doctrine in Western Christianity. Pelagianism was repudiated by the Council of Carthage in 418, largely at Augustine&#x27;s insistence. However, what Pelagius taught was likely what has come to be called semi-pelagianism.

In semi-Pelagian thought, both God and the human person always participate in the salvation process. Humans make free will choices, which are aided by God through creation, natural grace, &quot;supernatural&quot; grace, and God&#x27;s restrictions on demonic influences. God continually brings the human person to real choices, which God also aids, in the process of spiritual growth and salvation. Semi-Pelagianism involves synergism, which is the traditional patristic doctrine. John Cassian, in continuity with patristic doctrine, taught that though grace is required for persons to save themselves at the beginning, there is no such thing as total depravity, but there remains a moral or noetic ability within humans that is unaffected by original sin, and that persons must work together (synergism) with divine grace to be saved. This position is held by the Eastern Orthodox Church and by many Reformed Protestants, and in the Catholic Church has been especially associated with the Society of Jesus.

===Catholic versus Protestant===
In 1547, the Council of Trent, which sought to address and condemn Protestant objections, aimed to purge the Roman Catholic Church of controversial movements and establish an orthodox Roman Catholic teaching on grace and justification, as distinguished from the Protestant teachings on those concepts. It taught that justification and sanctification are elements of the same process. The grace of justification is bestowed through the merit of Christ&#x27;s passion, without any merits on the part of the person justified, who is enabled to cooperate only through the grace of God. The grace of justification may be lost through mortal sin, but can also be restored by the sacrament of Penance. The sacraments are, together with revealed truth, the principal means of the grace, a treasury of grace, that Christ has merited by his life and death and has given to the Church. This does not mean that other groups of Christians have no treasury of grace at their disposal, for, as the Second Vatican Council declared, &quot;many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside of (the Catholic Church&#x27;s) visible structure&quot;.

===Jansenists versus Jesuits===
At about the same time that Calvinists and Arminians were debating the meaning of grace in Protestantism, in Catholicism a similar debate was taking place between the Jansenists and the Jesuits. Cornelius Jansen&#x27;s 1640 work sought to refocus Catholic theology on the themes of original sin, human depravity, the necessity of divine grace, and predestination, as he found them in the works of Augustine. The Jansenists, like the Puritans, believed themselves to be members of a gathered church called out of worldly society, and banded together in institutions like the Port-Royal convents seeking to lead lives of greater spiritual intensity. Blaise Pascal attacked what he called moral laxity in the casuistry of the Jesuits. Jansenist theology remained a minority party within Catholicism, and during the second half of the 17th and 18th centuries it was condemned as a heresy for its similarities to Calvinism, though its style remained influential in ascetic circles.

=== Grace and merit ===

Citing the Council of Trent, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states:

==Eastern Christianity==

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, grace is identified with the uncreated Energies of God. Among Eastern Christians generally, grace is considered to be the partaking of the Divine Nature described in 2 Peter 1:4. The Holy Mysteries (Latin, &quot;sacraments&quot;) are seen as a means of partaking of divine grace because God works through his Church, not just because specific legalistic rules are followed; and grace is the working of God himself, not a created substance of any kind that can be treated like a commodity.

Orthodox theologians reject Augustine&#x27;s formulation of original sin and actively oppose the content and implications of John Calvin&#x27;s conceptions of total depravity and irresistible grace, characteristic of Reformed Protestantism, as well as the Thomistic and scholastic theology which would become official Roman Catholic pedagogy until the Second Vatican Council. Eastern Christians typically view scholasticism and similarly discursive, systematic theologies as rationalistic corruptions of the theology of the Cappadocian and early Desert Fathers that led the Western Church astray into heresy. Orthodoxy teaches that it is possible and necessary for the human will to cooperate with divine grace for the individual to be saved, or healed from the disease of sin. This cooperation is called synergism (see also semipelagianism and monergism), so that humans may become deified in conformity to the divine likeness – a process called &quot;theosis&quot; – by merging with the uncreated Energies of God (revealed to the senses as the Tabor Light of transfiguration), notably through a method of prayer called hesychasm.

===John Cassian===
In the works of John Cassian ( AD), &quot;Conference&quot; XIII recounts how the wise monk Chaeremon, of whom he is writing, responded to puzzlement caused by his own statement that &quot;man even though he strive with all his might for a good result, yet cannot become master of what is good unless he has acquired it simply by the gift of Divine bounty and not by the efforts of his own toil&quot; (Chapter 1). In Chapter 11, Cassian presents Chaeremon as speaking of the cases of &quot;Paul the persecutor&quot; and &quot;Matthew the publican&quot; as difficulties for those who say &quot;the beginning of free will is in our own power&quot;, and the cases of Zaccheus and the good thief on the cross as difficulties for those who say &quot;the beginning of our free will is always due to the inspiration of the grace of God&quot;. Chaeremon thus concludes; &quot;These two then; viz., the grace of God and free will seem opposed to each other, but really are in harmony, and we gather from the system of goodness that we ought to have both alike, lest if we withdraw one of them from man, we may seem to have broken the rule of the Church&#x27;s faith: for when God sees us inclined to will what is good, He meets, guides, and strengthens us: for &#x27;At the voice of thy cry, as soon as He shall hear, He will answer thee&#x27;; and: &#x27;Call upon Me&#x27;, He says, &#x27;in the day of tribulation and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me&#x27;. And again, if He finds that we are unwilling or have grown cold, He stirs our hearts with salutary exhortations, by which a good will is either renewed or formed in us.&quot;

Cassian did not accept the idea of total depravity, on which Martin Luther was to insist. He taught that human nature is fallen or depraved, but not totally. Augustine Casiday states that, at the same time, Cassian &quot;baldly asserts that God&#x27;s grace, not human free will, is responsible for &#x27;everything [that] pertains to salvation&#x27; – even faith&quot;. Cassian pointed out that people still have moral freedom and one has the option to choose to follow God. Colm Luibhéid says that, according to Cassian, there are cases where the soul makes the first little turn, but according to Casiday&#x27;s interpretation, any sparks of goodwill that may exist, not caused by God, are totally inadequate and only divine intervention ensures spiritual progress; and Lauren Pristas says that &quot;for Cassian, salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God&#x27;s grace&quot;.

==Protestant Reformation==
The Protestant Reformation reacted against the concepts of grace and merit as they were understood in late medieval Catholic theology.

===Luther and Lutheran theology===

Martin Luther&#x27;s posting of his ninety-five theses to the church door in Wittenberg in 1517 was a direct consequence of the perfunctory sacramentalism and treasury doctrines of the medieval church. The act was precipitated by the arrival of Johann Tetzel, authorized by the Vatican to sell indulgences.

The effectiveness of these indulgences was predicated on the doctrine of the treasury of grace proclaimed by Pope Clement VI. The theory was that merit earned by acts of piety could augment the believer&#x27;s store of sanctifying grace. Gifts to the Church were acts of piety. The Church, moreover, had a treasury full of grace above and beyond what was needed to get its faithful into heaven. The Church was willing to part with some of its surplus in exchange for earthly gold. Martin Luther&#x27;s anger against this practice, which seemed to him to involve the purchase of salvation, began a swing of the pendulum back towards the Pauline vision of grace, as opposed to James&#x27;s.

Luther taught that men were helpless and without a plea before God&#x27;s justice, and their acts of piety were utterly inadequate before his infinite holiness. Were God just, and not merciful, everyone would go to hell, because everyone, even the best of mankind, deserves to go to hell. Mankind&#x27;s inability to achieve salvation by its own effort suggests that even the best intentions are somehow tainted by mankind&#x27;s sinful nature. This doctrine is sometimes called total depravity, a term derived from Calvinism and its relatives.

It is by faith alone () and by grace alone () that men are saved. Good works are something the believers should undertake out of gratitude towards their Savior; but they are not sufficient for salvation and cannot earn anyone salvation; there is no room for the notion of &quot;merit&quot; in Luther&#x27;s doctrine of redemption. (There may, however, be degrees of reward for the redeemed in heaven.) Only the unearned, unmerited grace of God can save anyone. No one can have a claim of entitlement to God&#x27;s grace, and it is only by his generosity that salvation is even possible.

As opposed to the treasury of grace from which believers can make withdrawals, in Lutheranism salvation becomes a declaration of spiritual bankruptcy, in which penitents acknowledge the inadequacy of their own resources and trust only in God to save them. Accepting Augustine&#x27;s concern for legal justification as the base metaphor for salvation, the believers are not so much made righteous in Lutheranism as they are considered covered by Christ&#x27;s righteousness. Acknowledging that they have no power to make themselves righteous, the penalty for their sins is discharged because Jesus has already paid for it with his blood. His righteousness is credited to those who believe in and thus belong to him.

===Calvin and Reformed theology===
Calvin and Luther believed free will does not co-operate with God&#x27;s grace which, according to them, cannot be rejected (see monergism). The Lutheran Augsburg Confession says of baptism, &quot;Lutherans teach that it is necessary to salvation and that by baptism the grace of God is offered and that children are to be baptized, who by baptism, being offered to God, are received into God&#x27;s favor.&quot; The French reformer John Calvin expanded and further developed these Augustinian themes in his systematic &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot; in 1536.

The logical structure of Calvinism is often expressed as the acronym, TULIP. These five categories do not comprise Calvinism in its entirety; they simply encapsulate its central, definitive doctrines.

* Total depravity (also known as total inability, which is inexorably tied to a strong doctrine of original sin as having completely enslaved the human will)
* Unconditional election
* Limited Atonement (also known as definite atonement or particular redemption)
* Irresistible Grace
* Perseverance of the Saints (colloquially known as &quot;once saved, always saved&quot; or, as interpreted a distinct way among Reformed or Strict Baptists as well as non-Calvinist General Baptists, eternal security)

The notion that God has foreordained who will be saved is generally called predestination. The concept of predestination peculiar to Calvinism, &quot;double-predestination&quot;, (in conjunction with limited atonement) is the most controversial expression of the doctrine. According to Reformed theology, the &quot;good news&quot; of the gospel of Christ is that God has freely granted the gift of salvation to those the Holy Spirit causes to believe; what he freely grants to some (the &quot;elect&quot; individuals), he withholds from others (the &quot;reprobate&quot; individuals).

Calvin sought to provide assurance to the faithful that God would actually save them. His teaching implied what came to be known as the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, the notion that God would actually save those who were his Elect. The actual status and ultimate state of any man&#x27;s soul were unknown except to God. When assurance of election was rigorously pressed as an experience to be sought, especially by the Puritans, this led to a legalism as rigid as the one Protestantism sought to reject, as men were eager to demonstrate that they were among the chosen by the conspicuous works-righteousness of their lives.

The relatively radical positions of Reformed theology provoked a strong reaction from both Roman Catholics and Lutherans.

=== Classical and Wesleyan Arminian theology ===
In the beginning of the 17th century, the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius formulated Arminianism and departed from Calvin&#x27;s theology in particular on election and predestination. Arminianism affirms the compatibility between human free will and divine foreknowledge, and its incompatibility with theological determinism. Predestination in Arminianism is based on divine foreknowledge, unlike in Calvinism. Thus, the offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistibly in a purely cause-effect, deterministic method but rather in an influence-and-response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely denied. In Arminianism, God takes initiative in the salvation process and his grace comes to all people. This is done through prevenient grace which acts on all people to convince them of the Gospel, draw them strongly towards salvation, and enable the possibility of sincere faith. As Roger Olson put it: &quot;[Arminius]&#x27; evangelical synergism reserves all the power, ability and efficacy in salvation to grace, but allows humans the God-granted ability to resist or not resist it. The only &quot;contribution&quot; humans make is nonresistance to grace.&quot;

Later, John Wesley also rejected the Calvinist doctrine of predestination, and had the same Arminian understanding as expressed in Wesleyan theology. It remains the standard teaching of Methodist churches. Wesley also appealed to prevenient grace, stating that God makes the initial move in salvation, but human beings are free to respond or reject God&#x27;s graceful initiative. The doctrine of prevenient grace remains one of Methodism&#x27;s most important doctrines.

John Wesley distinguished three kinds of divine grace in the process of salvation: 1. &quot;Prevenient grace&quot; which is an enabling grace preceding regeneration (&quot;prevenient&quot; means preceding). 2. &quot;Justifying grace&quot; which can bring regeneration but which is resistible. 3. &quot;Sustaining grace&quot; which helps a person to remain into regeneration, and to reach sanctification and final salvation. In particular Wesley taught that Christian believers are to participate in the means of grace and to continue to grow in the Christian life, assisted by God&#x27;s sustaining grace.

===The Protestant Reformation and ecclesiology===
Protestantism in all three major schools of theology – Lutheran, Calvinist, and Arminian – emphasize God&#x27;s initiative in the work of salvation, which is achieved by grace alone through faith alone, in either stream of thinking – although these terms are understood differently, according to the differences in systems.

Classical Calvinism teaches that the sacraments are &quot;signs and seals of the covenant of grace&quot; and &quot;effectual means of salvation&quot;, and Lutheranism teaches that new life, faith, and union with Christ are granted by the Holy Spirit working through the sacraments. However, for a large portion of the Protestant world, the sacraments largely lost the importance that Luther (and to a slightly lesser degree, Calvin) attributed to them. This happened under the influence of ideas of the Anabaptists which were ideas also seen in the Donatists in North Africa in 311 AD, and these ideas then spread to Calvinists through the Congregationalist and Baptist movements, and to Lutherans through Pietism (although much of Lutheranism recoiled against the Pietist movement after the mid-19th century).

Where the sacraments are de-emphasized, they become &quot;ordinances&quot;, acts of worship which are required by Scripture, but whose effect is limited to the voluntary effect they have on the worshipper&#x27;s soul. This belief finds expression in the Baptist and Anabaptist practice of believer&#x27;s baptism, given not to infants as a mark of membership in a Christian community, but to adult believers after they have achieved the age of reason and have professed their faith. These ordinances are never considered works-righteousness. The ritual as interpreted in light of such ideas does not at all bring about salvation, nor does its performance bring about the forgiveness of sins; the forgiveness which the believer has received by faith is merely pictured, not effectively applied, by baptism; salvation and participation in Christ is memorialized (&quot;this do in remembrance of me&quot; in the Lord&#x27;s Supper and baptism picturing a Christian&#x27;s rebirth as death to sin and alive in Christ), not imparted, by the Eucharist. The Church to the Baptists becomes an assembly of true believers in Christ Jesus who gather together for worship and fellowship and remembering what Christ did for them.

==Churches of Christ==
The Churches of Christ believe that the grace of God that saves is the plan of salvation, rather than salvation itself. This plan includes two parts, 1) the perfect life, death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus the Christ, 2) the gospel/New Testament/the faith.

Concerning Ephesians 2:8 which states: &quot;For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God&quot;, it is noted that the word &quot;it&quot; is a pronoun and refers back to a noun. As the word &quot;saved&quot; is a verb, &quot;it&quot; does not refer to &quot;saved&quot; but to grace, giving the definition of grace as &quot;the gift of God&quot;. Furthermore, as the Book of James distinguishes between a dead faith (a faith without works) and a living faith (a faith accompanied by works of obedience), it is believed that God&#x27;s gift operates through an individual&#x27;s living faith resulting in that individual being saved.

# Grace is contrasted with the Law of Moses (Romans 6:14; Hebrews 10:4; John 1:17) and the church of Christ believes that Paul&#x27;s contrast between work and faith is as described under the Efforts to resolve the tension section, a contrast between works of the Old Covenant and obedient faith under the New Covenant.
# Grace saves (Ephesians 2:5); justifies (Romans 3:24; Titus 3:7).
# Grace can not be added to (Galatians 5:4).
# Grace teaches (Titus 2:11); can be preached (Ephesians 3:8).
# Grace calls mankind (2 Timothy 1:9; Galatians 1:15).
# Grace is brought by revelation (1 Peter 1:13).
# Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ (John 1:17)
# Grace is sufficient for mankind (2 Corinthians 12:9)

The Galatians were removed from the calling of the gospel (Galatians 1:6,7; 2 Thessalonians 2:14) unto another gospel (another message) which verse 7 says is not a gospel at all but a perversion.

The Church of Christ believes that grace provides the following plan, which, if followed, results in salvation:

* One must hear the gospel/word (Romans 10:17).
* Believe the gospel (Mark 16:15–16).
* Repent of their past sins (Acts 2:38).
* Confess their faith in Christ before men (Matthew 10:32; Romans 10:9–10).
* Be immersed in water into Christ for the remission of those sins (1 Peter 3:21; Romans 6:3–18; John 3:3,5; 1 John 5:6,8; Acts 2:38; Mark 16:16; etc.)
* Live faithfully even to the point of death (Revelation 2:10; Romans 11:17–22; James 5:19–20).

<text>A mine roller or mine trawl is a demining device mounted on a tank or armoured personnel carrier, designed to detonate anti-tank mines. It allows engineers to clear a lane through a minefield which is protected by enemy fire.

The device is usually composed of a fork or two push arm assemblies fitted to the front of a tank hull, with two banks of rollers that can be lowered in front of the tank&#x27;s tracks. Each roller bank has several heavy wheels studded with short projecting steel girders, which apply a higher ground pressure than the tank&#x27;s tracks. This ensures the explosion of pressure-fused anti-tank mines, which would otherwise explode under the track itself.

==History==
At the end of the First World War, the British Army Engineers Major Giffard Le Quesne Martel and Major Charles Inglis experimented with tank bridges and mine rollers based on the Mark V tank. Three special tank battalions were mustered for trials at Christchurch in Hampshire, England, in 1918. Because of the Armistice, these were never tested in battle, but some development work continued with the Experimental Bridging Company until 1925.

After great difficulties caused by minefields in the Winter War against Finland, the Soviet Red Army assigned P.M. Mugalev at the Dormashina Factory in Nikolayev to design a mine-clearing vehicle. Prototypes were tested based on the T-28 medium tank in 1940. Development was interrupted by the start of World War II, but resumed in 1942. T-60 and KV tank chassis underwent trials, but only the T-34 was deemed to have a sufficiently robust transmission and clutch.

Experimental detachments of PT-34 mine roller tanks were formed in May 1942, and saw action at Voronezh in August. The first Independent Engineer Tank Regiment with eighteen mine rollers was fielded in October 1943. At least five regiments were formed during the war.

The PT-34&#x27;s huge roller fork was semi-permanently mounted on a T-34 or T-34-85 tank. The rollers were usually removed for travel, and only installed for mine clearing operations. Adaptations for later tanks consisted of two lighter arms. The Mugalev system was adopted by U.S. and Israeli forces in the 1980s.

During WWII, the Germans created the experimental Räumer S 4-wheeled armoured mine clearance vehicle, built by Krupp. Weighing 130 tons and powered by a Maybach HL90 engine, the prototype was captured by the Americans at the end of the war.

The British developed the &quot;Anti Mine Roller Attachment&quot; (AMRA) for their Matilda II, Valentine, and Crusader tanks in the desert. The rollers only covered the width of each track rather than clearing a tank-width path for subsequent vehicles and troops. To these were added a Churchill tank with the evocatively named &quot;Canadian Indestructible Roller Device&quot; (CIRD). The British used mine rollers to detect the presence of minefields and then used mine flails for the clearance.

During World War II, the mine roller most used by US forces was the T1E3 Mine Exploder unit, attached to the M4 Sherman medium tank. It was nicknamed &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; because of its pancake-like appearance. It had two sets of five disc rollers, in diameter each.

==Post WW2==
Since 1945, a number of countries have developed mine rollers including:
* Russia - Stankomash Ltd. - TMT. 
* UK - Armtrac Limited - Armtrac Roller - capable of operating at 50 kph.
* UK - Pearson Engineering - Light Weight Mine Roller (LWMR). 
* USA - Axion Corporation - fits to Abrams tank.

<doc id="191761" wikidata="Q16928028" url="?curid=191761" title="Name binding">
<text>In programming languages, name binding is the association of entities (data and/or code) with identifiers. An identifier bound to an object is said to reference that object. Machine languages have no built-in notion of identifiers, but name-object bindings as a service and notation for the programmer is implemented by programming languages. Binding is intimately connected with scoping, as scope determines which names bind to which objects – at which locations in the program code (lexically) and in which one of the possible execution paths (temporally).

Use of an identifier in a context that establishes a binding for is called a binding (or defining) occurrence. In all other occurrences (e.g., in expressions, assignments, and subprogram calls), an identifier stands for what it is bound to; such occurrences are called applied occurrences.

==Binding time==
* &quot;Static binding&quot; (or &quot;early binding&quot;) is name binding performed before the program is run.
* &quot;Dynamic binding&quot; (or &quot;late binding&quot; or &quot;virtual binding&quot;) is name binding performed as the program is running.

An example of a static binding is a direct C function call: the function referenced by the identifier cannot change at runtime.

An example of dynamic binding is dynamic dispatch, as in a C++ virtual method call. Since the specific type of a polymorphic object is not known before runtime (in general), the executed function is dynamically bound. Take, for example, the following Java code:
public void foo(java.util.List&lt;String&gt; list) {
 list.add(&quot;bar&quot;);


codice_1 is an interface, so codice_2 must refer to a subtype of it. codice_2 may reference a codice_4, an codice_5, or some other subtype of codice_1. The method referenced by codice_7 is not known until runtime. In C, which does not have dynamic binding, a similar goal may be achieved by a call to a function pointed to by a variable or expression of a function pointer type, whose value is unknown until it is evaluated at run-time.

==Rebinding and mutation==
Rebinding should not be confused with mutation or assignment.

* &quot;Rebinding&quot; is a change to the &quot;referencing&quot; identifier.
* &quot;Assignment&quot; is a change to (the referenced) variable.
* &quot;Mutation&quot; is a change to an object in memory, possibly referenced by a variable or bound to an identifier.

Consider the following Java code:
LinkedList&lt;String&gt; list;
list = new LinkedList&lt;String&gt;();
list.add(&quot;foo&quot;);
list = null;
{ LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;(); list.add(Integer(2)); }
The identifier codice_2 is bound to a variable in the first line; in the second, an object (a linked list of strings) is assigned to the variable. The linked list referenced by the variable is then mutated, adding a string to the list. Next, the variable is assigned the constant codice_9. In the last line, the identifier is rebound for the scope of the block. Operations within the block access a new variable and not the variable previously bound to codice_2.

==Late static==
Late static binding is a variant of binding somewhere between static and dynamic binding. Consider the following PHP example:

class A
 public static $word = &quot;hello&quot;;
 public static function hello() { print self::$word; }

class B extends A
 public static $word = &quot;bye&quot;;

B::hello();
In this example, the PHP interpreter binds the keyword codice_11 inside codice_12 to class codice_13, and so the call to codice_14 produces the string &quot;hello&quot;. If the semantics of codice_15 had been based on late static binding, then the result would have been &quot;bye&quot;.

Beginning with PHP version 5.3, late static binding is supported. Specifically, if codice_15 in the above were changed to codice_17 as shown in the following block, where the keyword codice_18 would only be bound at runtime, then the result of the call to codice_14 would be &quot;bye&quot;:
class A
 public static $word = &quot;hello&quot;;
 public static function hello() { print static::$word; }

class B extends A
 public static $word = &quot;bye&quot;;

B::hello();

<doc id="191766" wikidata="Q333707" url="?curid=191766" title="Compile time">
<text>In computer science, compile time (or compile-time) describes the time window during which a language&#x27;s statements are converted into binary instructions for the processor to execute.
The term is used as an adjective to describe concepts related to the context of program compilation, as opposed to concepts related to the context of program execution (runtime).
For example, &quot;compile-time requirements&quot; are programming language requirements that must be met by source code before compilation and &quot;compile-time properties&quot; are properties of the program that can be reasoned about during compilation.
The actual length of time it takes to compile a program is usually referred to as &quot;compilation time&quot;.

== Compile time/Early binding vs Run time ==
The determination of execution model have been set during the compile time stage.
Run time- the method of execution and allocation - have been set during the run time and are based on the run time dynamicity.

==Overview==
Most compilers have at least the following compiler phases (which therefore occur at compile-time): syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.
During optimization phases, constant expressions in the source code can also be evaluated at compile-time using &quot;compile-time execution&quot;, which reduces the constant expressions to a single value.
This is not necessary for correctness, but improves program performance during runtime.

Programming language definitions usually specify compile time requirements that source code must meet to be successfully compiled.
For example, languages may stipulate that the amount of storage required by types and variables can be deduced.

Properties of a program that can be reasoned about at compile time include range-checks (e.g., proving that an array index will not exceed the array bounds), deadlock freedom in concurrent languages, or timings (e.g., proving that a sequence of code takes no more than an allocated amount of time).

Compile-time occurs before link time (when the output of one or more compiled files are joined) and runtime (when a program is executed).
Although in the case of dynamic compilation, the final transformations into machine language happen at runtime.

There is a trade-off between compile-time and link-time in that many compile time operations can be deferred to link-time without incurring run-time cost.

<doc id="191778" wikidata="Q2141583" url="?curid=191778" title="Placer deposit">
<text>In geology, a placer deposit or placer is an accumulation of valuable minerals formed by gravity separation from a specific source rock during sedimentary processes. The name is from the Spanish word &quot;placer&quot;, meaning &quot;alluvial sand&quot;. Placer mining is an important source of gold, and was the main technique used in the early years of many gold rushes, including the California Gold Rush. Types of placer deposits include alluvium, eluvium, beach placers, aeolian placers and paleo-placers.

Placer materials must be both dense and resistant to weathering processes. To accumulate in placers, mineral particles must have a specific gravity above 2.58.

Placer environments typically contain black sand, a conspicuous shiny black mixture of iron oxides, mostly magnetite with variable amounts of ilmenite and hematite. Valuable mineral components often occurring with black sands are monazite, rutile, zircon, chromite, wolframite, and cassiterite. Early mining operations were probably a result of placer deposits as they were easily accessible and potential size. The events known as gold/diamond rushes were caused by placer deposits and have proved to be plentiful.

== Characteristics of placer minerals ==

=== Density ===
Placer minerals are defined as having a specific gravity above 2.58. The separation of the valuable minerals from the most common non-economic mineral, quartz, depends on the difference in specific gravity / density.The weathering process allows for the accumulation of placer minerals, while less dense material such as quartz are swept away.

=== Hardness ===
Hardness allows placer minerals to resist mechanical breakdown and loss of mass from abrasion during transport. A hardness greater than quartz is desired, however substances such as gold typically deform and create irregularly shaped nuggets when subject to mechanical stress.

=== Stability ===
Chemical stability is important for a placer mineral to resist chemical breakdown such as oxidation, Minerals lacking chemical stability will form less desirable alteration when subject to chemical breakdown.

== Types of placers ==

=== Alluvial placers ===

Alluvial placers are those formed in river or stream sediments. Another name for alluvial placers are stream placers. Typical locations for alluvial gold placer deposits are on the inside bends of rivers and creeks; in natural hollows; at the break of slope on a stream; the base of an escarpment, waterfall or other barrier. Stream placers are the most economical and common types of placers and have provided many with riches in the past.

Alluvial placers are formed by the deposition of dense particles at a site where water velocity remains below that required to transport them further.

To form a placer deposit, the particles desired must show a marked density contrast with the gangue material, which is able to be transported away from the trap site. Only if the deposit is winnowed in this way can the minerals be concentrated to economic levels.

=== Beach placers ===
Beach placers are formed in sand and gravel deposited along the edge of large bodies of water and are typically found where streams or rivers flow into a large body of water. Materials collect as beach placers by continuous wave action and currents. Some important examples of beach placers include black sands of Oregon, gold deposits in Nome, Alaska, zircon sands in Brazil and Australia as well as diamond marine gravel in South Africa.

Gold bearing beach placers consist of large strips of black sands and are typically constantly changing as a result of storms or sporadic wave action. Typically beach placers are populated by ilmenite and magnetite, however gold, platinum and chromite are found in varying amounts. Some of the most productive beach placers are considered ancient beaches that are now far inland from the water, these placers no longer shift with storms and tidal action but with wind and rainfall.

=== Eluvial placers ===
Eluvial placers are deposits of metal formed on hillsides and slopes weathered by rainfall and wind. Lighter materials are carried away and weathered leaving concentrations of valuable metals.

Eluvial placers are typically not large enough to support large scale mining, however in one case in Nevada there has been large scale gold mining operations based on placer deposits at Round Mountain.

=== Aeolian placers ===
Aeolian placers are valuable minerals found in arid regions freed from their source rock by wind actions. Wind erosion leaves a cement like substance in which material like gold are found. Wind action blows sand and dirt away leaving the deposits close to the surface. Historically, aeolian placers have been mined by hand with simple tools by miners due to the proximity to the surface, and small concentration.

Aeolian placers are common in Australia and the Western United states, where the climate is arid and the ground is relatively level leaving wind as the primary erosion force.

=== Paleo-placers ===
Paleo-placer deposits are deposits of minerals from all of the above placer types that occurred millions of years ago. These deposits are typically very far underground in ancient riverbeds, beaches, or slopes. The Witwatersrand Basin, South Africa is the largest gold deposit in the world and is considered a paleo-placer, it has produced over 1.5 billion ounces of gold. The Witwatersrand Basin is considered an ancient alluvial placer.

== Substances mined ==
Substances commercially mined from placer deposits include:
* Diamond
* Gold
* Garnet
* Iron, from ironsands containing high concentrations of magnetite
* Platinum group metals
* Rare-earth elements, from the mineral monazite
* Ruby
* Sapphire
* Thorium, from monazite
* Tin, in the mineral cassiterite
* Titanium, from the minerals ilmenite and rutile
* Uranium, from Precambrian paleoplacers
* Zirconium, from the mineral zircon

== Source rock ==

=== Diamonds ===
Kimberlites are a major source of diamonds. Kimberlites are long &quot;pipes&quot; of lava brought up from the mantle where diamonds form at high temperatures and pressures. These diamonds are then weathered from the source and swept away by alluvial processes (transported by water) to a source that becomes a diamond deposit. Alluvial diamond deposits are mined after removing overburden from the top of the rich, diamond-gravel layer. Roughly 10 percent of diamonds are mined from alluvial diamond placer mines. The Witwatersrand Basin in Africa mentioned above is a recognized alluvial diamond deposit.

<doc id="191786" wikidata="Q247204" url="?curid=191786" title="Counting measure">
<text>In mathematics, specifically measure theory, the counting measure is an intuitive way to put a measure on any set – the &quot;size&quot; of a subset is taken to be the number of elements in the subset if the subset has finitely many elements, and infinity formula_1 if the subset is infinite.

The counting measure can be defined on any measurable space (that is, any set formula_2 along with a sigma-algebra) but is mostly used on countable sets.

In formal notation, we can turn any set formula_2 into a measurable space by taking the power set of formula_2 as the sigma-algebra formula_5 that is, all subsets of formula_2 are measurable sets. 
Then the counting measure formula_7 on this measurable space formula_8 is the positive measure formula_9 defined by
formula_10
for all formula_11 where formula_12 denotes the cardinality of the set formula_13

The counting measure on formula_8 is σ-finite if and only if the space formula_2 is countable.

==Integration on the set of natural numbers with counting measure==

Take the measure space formula_16, where formula_17 is the set of all subsets of the naturals and formula_7 the counting measure. Take any measurable formula_19. As it is defined on formula_20, formula_21 can be represented pointwise as formula_22 

Each formula_23 is measurable. Moreover formula_24. Still further, as each formula_23 is a simple function formula_26Hence by the monotone convergence theorem
formula_27

==Discussion==

The counting measure is a special case of a more general construction. With the notation as above, any function formula_28 defines a measure formula_7 on formula_30 via
formula_31
where the possibly uncountable sum of real numbers is defined to be the supremum of the sums over all finite subsets, that is, 
formula_32
Taking formula_33 for all formula_34 gives the counting measure.

<doc id="191788" wikidata="Q1000660" url="?curid=191788" title="Algebra over a field">
<text>In mathematics, an algebra over a field (often simply called an algebra) is a vector space equipped with a bilinear product. Thus, an algebra is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with operations of multiplication and addition and scalar multiplication by elements of a field and satisfying the axioms implied by &quot;vector space&quot; and &quot;bilinear&quot;.

The multiplication operation in an algebra may or may not be associative, leading to the notions of associative algebras where associativity of multiplication is assumed, and non-associative algebras, where associativity is not assumed (but not excluded, either). Given an integer &quot;n&quot;, the ring of real square matrices of order &quot;n&quot; is an example of an associative algebra over the field of real numbers under matrix addition and matrix multiplication since matrix multiplication is associative. Three-dimensional Euclidean space with multiplication given by the vector cross product is an example of a nonassociative algebra over the field of real numbers since the vector cross product is nonassociative, satisfying the Jacobi identity instead.

An algebra is unital or unitary if it has an identity element with respect to the multiplication. The ring of real square matrices of order &quot;n&quot; forms a unital algebra since the identity matrix of order &quot;n&quot; is the identity element with respect to matrix multiplication. It is an example of a unital associative algebra, a (unital) ring that is also a vector space.

Many authors use the term &quot;algebra&quot; to mean &quot;associative algebra&quot;, or &quot;unital associative algebra&quot;, or in some subjects such as algebraic geometry, &quot;unital associative commutative algebra&quot;.

Replacing the field of scalars by a commutative ring leads to the more general notion of an algebra over a ring. Algebras are not to be confused with vector spaces equipped with a bilinear form, like inner product spaces, as, for such a space, the result of a product is not in the space, but rather in the field of coefficients.

== Definition and motivation ==
===Motivating examples===
=== Definition ===
Let be a field, and let be a vector space over equipped with an additional binary operation from to , denoted here by (that is, if and are any two elements of , then is an element of that is called the &quot;product&quot; of and ). Then is an &quot;algebra&quot; over if the following identities hold for all elements in , and all elements (often called scalars) and in :
* Right distributivity: 
* Left distributivity: 
* Compatibility with scalars: .

These three axioms are another way of saying that the binary operation is bilinear. An algebra over is sometimes also called a &quot;-algebra&quot;, and is called the &quot;base field&quot; of . The binary operation is often referred to as &quot;multiplication&quot; in . The convention adopted in this article is that multiplication of elements of an algebra is not necessarily associative, although some authors use the term &quot;algebra&quot; to refer to an associative algebra.

When a binary operation on a vector space is commutative, left distributivity and right distributivity are equivalent, and, in this case, only one distributivity requires a proof. In general, for non-commutative operations left distributivity and right distributivity are not equivalent, and require separate proofs.

== Basic concepts ==

=== Algebra homomorphisms ===
Given -algebras and , a homomorphism of -algebras or -algebra homomorphism is a -linear map such that for all in . If and are unital, then a homomorphism satisfying is said to be a unital homomorphism. The space of all -algebra homomorphisms between and is frequently written as
:formula_1
A -algebra isomorphism is a bijective -algebra homomorphism.
=== Subalgebras and ideals ===

A subalgebra of an algebra over a field &quot;K&quot; is a linear subspace that has the property that the product of any two of its elements is again in the subspace. In other words, a subalgebra of an algebra is a non-empty subset of elements that is closed under addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication. In symbols, we say that a subset &quot;L&quot; of a &quot;K&quot;-algebra &quot;A&quot; is a subalgebra if for every &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;L&quot; and &quot;c&quot; in &quot;K&quot;, we have that &quot;x&quot; · &quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;cx&quot; are all in &quot;L&quot;.

In the above example of the complex numbers viewed as a two-dimensional algebra over the real numbers, the one-dimensional real line is a subalgebra.

A &quot;left ideal&quot; of a &quot;K&quot;-algebra is a linear subspace that has the property that any element of the subspace multiplied on the left by any element of the algebra produces an element of the subspace. In symbols, we say that a subset &quot;L&quot; of a &quot;K&quot;-algebra &quot;A&quot; is a left ideal if for every &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;z&quot; in &quot;A&quot; and &quot;c&quot; in &quot;K&quot;, we have the following three statements.
# &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; is in &quot;L&quot; (&quot;L&quot; is closed under addition),
# &quot;cx&quot; is in &quot;L&quot; (&quot;L&quot; is closed under scalar multiplication),
# &quot;z&quot; · &quot;x&quot; is in &quot;L&quot; (&quot;L&quot; is closed under left multiplication by arbitrary elements).

If (3) were replaced with &quot;x&quot; · &quot;z&quot; is in &quot;L&quot;, then this would define a &quot;right ideal&quot;. A &quot;two-sided ideal&quot; is a subset that is both a left and a right ideal. The term &quot;ideal&quot; on its own is usually taken to mean a two-sided ideal. Of course when the algebra is commutative, then all of these notions of ideal are equivalent. Conditions (1) and (2) together are equivalent to &quot;L&quot; being a linear subspace of &quot;A&quot;. It follows from condition (3) that every left or right ideal is a subalgebra.

This definition is different from the definition of an ideal of a ring, in that here we require the condition (2). Of course if the algebra is unital, then condition (3) implies condition (2).

=== Extension of scalars ===

If we have a field extension &quot;F&quot;/&quot;K&quot;, which is to say a bigger field &quot;F&quot; that contains &quot;K&quot;, then there is a natural way to construct an algebra over &quot;F&quot; from any algebra over &quot;K&quot;. It is the same construction one uses to make a vector space over a bigger field, namely the tensor product formula_2. So if &quot;A&quot; is an algebra over &quot;K&quot;, then formula_3 is an algebra over &quot;F&quot;.

== Kinds of algebras and examples ==

Algebras over fields come in many different types. These types are specified by insisting on some further axioms, such as commutativity or associativity of the multiplication operation, which are not required in the broad definition of an algebra. The theories corresponding to the different types of algebras are often very different.

=== Unital algebra ===

An algebra is &quot;unital&quot; or &quot;unitary&quot; if it has a unit or identity element &quot;I&quot; with &quot;Ix&quot; = &quot;x&quot; = &quot;xI&quot; for all &quot;x&quot; in the algebra.

=== Zero algebra ===
An algebra is called a zero algebra if for all &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot; in the algebra, not to be confused with the algebra with one element. It is inherently non-unital (except in the case of only one element), associative and commutative.

One may define a unital zero algebra by taking the direct sum of modules of a field (or more generally a ring) &quot;K&quot; and a &quot;K&quot;-vector space (or module) &quot;V&quot;, and defining the product of every pair of elements of &quot;V&quot; to be zero. That is, if and , then . If is a basis of &quot;V&quot;, the unital zero algebra is the quotient of the polynomial ring by the ideal generated by the &quot;E&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;E&quot;&quot;j&quot; for every pair .

An example of unital zero algebra is the algebra of dual numbers, the unital zero R-algebra built from a one dimensional real vector space.

These unital zero algebras may be more generally useful, as they allow to translate any general property of the algebras to properties of vector spaces or modules. For example, the theory of Gröbner bases was introduced by Bruno Buchberger for ideals in a polynomial ring over a field. The construction of the unital zero algebra over a free &quot;R&quot;-module allows extending this theory as a Gröbner basis theory for submodules of a free module. This extension allows, for computing a Gröbner basis of a submodule, to use, without any modification, any algorithm and any software for computing Gröbner bases of ideals.

=== Associative algebra ===
Examples of associative algebras include
* the algebra of all &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices over a field (or commutative ring) &quot;K&quot;. Here the multiplication is ordinary matrix multiplication.
* group algebras, where a group serves as a basis of the vector space and algebra multiplication extends group multiplication.
* the commutative algebra &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] of all polynomials over &quot;K&quot; (see polynomial ring).
* algebras of functions, such as the R-algebra of all real-valued continuous functions defined on the interval [0,1], or the C-algebra of all holomorphic functions defined on some fixed open set in the complex plane. These are also commutative.
* Incidence algebras are built on certain partially ordered sets.
* algebras of linear operators, for example on a Hilbert space. Here the algebra multiplication is given by the composition of operators. These algebras also carry a topology; many of them are defined on an underlying Banach space, which turns them into Banach algebras. If an involution is given as well, we obtain B*-algebras and C*-algebras. These are studied in functional analysis.

=== Non-associative algebra ===

A &quot;non-associative algebra&quot; (or &quot;distributive algebra&quot;) over a field &quot;K&quot; is a &quot;K&quot;-vector space &quot;A&quot; equipped with a &quot;K&quot;-bilinear map formula_4. The usage of &quot;non-associative&quot; here is meant to convey that associativity is not assumed, but it does not mean it is prohibited – that is, it means &quot;not necessarily associative&quot;.

Examples detailed in the main article include:
* Euclidean space R3 with multiplication given by the vector cross product
* Octonions
* Lie algebras
* Jordan algebras 
* Alternative algebras
* Flexible algebras
* Power-associative algebras

==Algebras and rings==
The definition of an associative &quot;K&quot;-algebra with unit is also frequently given in an alternative way. In this case, an algebra over a field &quot;K&quot; is a ring &quot;A&quot; together with a ring homomorphism

:formula_5

where &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is the center of &quot;A&quot;. Since &quot;η&quot; is a ring homomorphism, then one must have either that &quot;A&quot; is the zero ring, or that &quot;η&quot; is injective. This definition is equivalent to that above, with scalar multiplication
:formula_6
given by
:formula_7
Given two such associative unital &quot;K&quot;-algebras &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, a unital &quot;K&quot;-algebra homomorphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is a ring homomorphism that commutes with the scalar multiplication defined by &quot;η&quot;, which one may write as
:formula_8
for all formula_9 and formula_10. In other words, the following diagram commutes:
:formula_11

== Structure coefficients ==

For algebras over a field, the bilinear multiplication from &quot;A&quot; × &quot;A&quot; to &quot;A&quot; is completely determined by the multiplication of basis elements of &quot;A&quot;.
Conversely, once a basis for &quot;A&quot; has been chosen, the products of basis elements can be set arbitrarily, and then extended in a unique way to a bilinear operator on &quot;A&quot;, i.e., so the resulting multiplication satisfies the algebra laws.

Thus, given the field &quot;K&quot;, any finite-dimensional algebra can be specified up to isomorphism by giving its dimension (say &quot;n&quot;), and specifying &quot;n&quot;3 &quot;structure coefficients&quot; &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot;, which are scalars.
These structure coefficients determine the multiplication in &quot;A&quot; via the following rule:
: formula_12
where e1...,e&quot;n&quot; form a basis of &quot;A&quot;.

Note however that several different sets of structure coefficients can give rise to isomorphic algebras.

In mathematical physics, the structure coefficients are generally written with upper and lower indices, so as to distinguish their transformation properties under coordinate transformations. Specifically, lower indices are covariant indices, and transform via pullbacks, while upper indices are contravariant, transforming under pushforwards. Thus, the structure coefficients are often written &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;k&quot;, and their defining rule is written using the Einstein notation as
: e&quot;i&quot;e&quot;j&quot; = &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;k&quot;e&quot;k&quot;.
If you apply this to vectors written in index notation, then this becomes
: (xy)&quot;k&quot; = &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;y&quot;&quot;j&quot;.

If &quot;K&quot; is only a commutative ring and not a field, then the same process works if &quot;A&quot; is a free module over &quot;K&quot;. If it isn&#x27;t, then the multiplication is still completely determined by its action on a set that spans &quot;A&quot;; however, the structure constants can&#x27;t be specified arbitrarily in this case, and knowing only the structure constants does not specify the algebra up to isomorphism.

== Classification of low-dimensional unital associative algebras over the complex numbers ==

Two-dimensional, three-dimensional and four-dimensional unital associative algebras over the field of complex numbers were completely classified up to isomorphism by Eduard Study.

There exist two such two-dimensional algebras. Each algebra consists of linear combinations (with complex coefficients) of two basis elements, 1 (the identity element) and &quot;a&quot;. According to the definition of an identity element,
:formula_13
It remains to specify
:formula_14   for the first algebra,
:formula_15   for the second algebra.

There exist five such three-dimensional algebras. Each algebra consists of linear combinations of three basis elements, 1 (the identity element), &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Taking into account the definition of an identity element, it is sufficient to specify
:formula_16   for the first algebra,
:formula_17   for the second algebra,
:formula_18   for the third algebra,
:formula_19   for the fourth algebra,
:formula_20   for the fifth algebra.
The fourth of these algebras is non-commutative, and the others are commutative.

== Generalization: algebra over a ring ==

In some areas of mathematics, such as commutative algebra, it is common to consider the more general concept of an algebra over a ring, where a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; replaces the field &quot;K&quot;. The only part of the definition that changes is that &quot;A&quot; is assumed to be an &quot;R&quot;-module (instead of a &quot;K&quot;-vector space).

===Associative algebras over rings===
A ring &quot;A&quot; is always an associative algebra over its center, and over the integers. A classical example of an algebra over its center is the split-biquaternion algebra, which is isomorphic to formula_21, the direct product of two quaternion algebras. The center of that ring is formula_22, and hence it has the structure of an algebra over its center, which is not a field. Note that the split-biquaternion algebra is also naturally an 8-dimensional formula_23-algebra.

In commutative algebra, if &quot;A&quot; is a commutative ring, then any unital ring homomorphism formula_24 defines an &quot;R&quot;-module structure on &quot;A&quot;, and this is what is known as the &quot;R&quot;-algebra structure. So a ring comes with a natural formula_25-module structure, since one can take the unique homomorphism formula_26. On the other hand, not all rings can be given the structure of an algebra over a field (for example the integers). See &quot;Field with one element&quot; for a description of an attempt to give to every ring a structure that behaves like an algebra over a field.

<doc id="191797" wikidata="Q2004664" url="?curid=191797" title="Kolmogorov's zero–one law">
<text>In probability theory, Kolmogorov&#x27;s zero–one law, named in honor of Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, specifies that a certain type of event, namely a &quot;tail event of independent σ-algebras&quot;, will either almost surely happen or almost surely not happen; that is, the probability of such an event occurring is zero or one.

Tail events are defined in terms of countably infinite families of σ-algebras. For illustrative purposes, we present here the special case in which each sigma algebra is generated by a random variable formula_1 for formula_2. Let formula_3 be the sigma-algebra generated jointly by all of the formula_1. Then, a tail event formula_5 is an event the occurrence of which cannot depend on the outcome of a finite subfamily of these random variables. (Note: formula_6 belonging to formula_3 implies that membership in formula_6 is uniquely determined by the values of the formula_1, but the latter condition is strictly weaker and does not suffice to prove the zero-one law.) For example, the event that the sequence of the formula_1 converges, and the event that its sum converges are both tail events. If the formula_1 are, for example, all Bernoulli-distributed, then the event that there are infinitely many formula_2 such that formula_13 is a tail event. If each formula_1 models the outcome of the formula_15-th coin toss in a modeled, infinite sequence of coin tosses, this means that a sequence of 100 consecutive heads occurring infinitely many times is a tail event in this model.

Tail events are precisely those events whose occurrence can still be determined if an arbitrarily large but finite initial segment of the formula_1 is removed.

In many situations, it can be easy to apply Kolmogorov&#x27;s zero–one law to show that some event has probability 0 or 1, but surprisingly hard to determine &quot;which&quot; of these two extreme values is the correct one.

== Formulation ==
A more general statement of Kolmogorov&#x27;s zero–one law holds for sequences of independent σ-algebras. Let (Ω,&quot;F&quot;,&quot;P&quot;) be a probability space and let &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; be a sequence of σ-algebras contained in &quot;F&quot;. Let
:formula_17
be the smallest σ-algebra containing &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1, ... The &quot;terminal σ-algebra&quot; of the &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; is defined as formula_18.

Kolmogorov&#x27;s zero–one law asserts that, if the &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; are stochastically independent, then for any event formula_19, one has either &quot;P&quot;(&quot;E&quot;) = 0 or &quot;P&quot;(&quot;E&quot;)=1.

The statement of the law in terms of random variables is obtained from the latter by taking each &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; to be the σ-algebra generated by the random variable &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;. A tail event is then by definition an event which is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra generated by all &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, but which is independent of any finite number of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;. That is, a tail event is precisely an element of the terminal σ-algebra formula_20.

==Examples==
An invertible measure-preserving transformation on a standard probability space that obeys the 0-1 law is called a Kolmogorov automorphism. All Bernoulli automorphisms are Kolmogorov automorphisms but not &quot;vice versa&quot;. The presence of an infinite cluster in the context of percolation theory also obeys the 0-1 law.

Let formula_21 be a sequence of independent random variables, then the event formula_22 is a tail event. Thus by Kolmogorov 0-1 law, it has either probability 0 or 1 to happen. Note that independence is required for the tail event condition to hold. Without independence we can consider a sequence that&#x27;s either formula_23 or formula_24 with probability formula_25 each. In this case the sum converges with probability formula_25.

<text>Wilhelm Eduard Weber (; ; 24 October 1804 – 23 June 1891) was a German physicist and, together with Carl Friedrich Gauss, inventor of the first electromagnetic telegraph.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Weber was born in Schlossstrasse in Wittenberg, where his father, Michael Weber, was professor of theology. The building had previously been the home of Abraham Vater. 

Wilhelm was the second of three brothers, all of whom were distinguished by an aptitude for science. After the dissolution of the University of Wittenberg his father was transferred to Halle in 1815. Wilhelm had received his first lessons from his father, but was now sent to the Orphan Asylum and Grammar School at Halle. After that he entered the University, and devoted himself to natural philosophy. He distinguished himself so much in his classes, and by original work, that after taking his degree of Doctor and becoming a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; he was appointed Professor Extraordinary of natural philosophy at Halle.
===Career===
In 1831, on the recommendation of Carl Friedrich Gauss, he was hired by the University of Göttingen as professor of physics, at the age of twenty-seven. His lectures were interesting, instructive, and suggestive. Weber thought that, in order to thoroughly understand physics and apply it to daily life, mere lectures, though illustrated by experiments, were insufficient, and he encouraged his students to experiment themselves, free of charge, in the college laboratory. As a student of twenty years he, with his brother, Ernst Heinrich Weber, Professor of Anatomy at Leipzig, had written a book on the &quot;Wave Theory and Fluidity,&quot; which brought its authors a considerable reputation. Acoustics was a favourite science of his, and he published numerous papers upon it in &quot;Poggendorffs Annalen,&quot; Schweigger&#x27;s &quot;Jahrbücher für Chemie und Physik,&quot; and the musical journal &quot;Carcilia.&quot; The &#x27;mechanism of walking in mankind&#x27; was another study, undertaken in conjunction with his younger brother, Eduard Weber. These important investigations were published between the years 1825 and 1838. Gauss and Weber constructed the first electromagnetic telegraph in 1833, which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in Göttingen.

In December 1837, the Hanoverian government dismissed Weber, one of the Göttingen Seven, from his post at the university for political reasons. Weber then travelled for a time, visiting England, among other countries, and became professor of physics in Leipzig from 1843 to 1849, when he was reinstated at Göttingen. One of his most important works, co-authored with Carl Friedrich Gauss and Carl Wolfgang Benjamin Goldschmidt, was &quot;Atlas des Erdmagnetismus: nach den Elementen der Theorie entworfen&quot; (&quot;Atlas of Geomagnetism: Designed according to the elements of the theory&quot;), a series of magnetic maps, and it was chiefly through his efforts that magnetic observatories were instituted. He studied magnetism with Gauss, and during 1864 published his &quot;Electrodynamic Proportional Measures&quot; containing a system of absolute measurements for electric currents, which forms the basis of those in use. Weber died in Göttingen, where he is buried in the same cemetery as Max Planck and Max Born.
He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1855.

In 1855 with Rudolf Kohlrausch (1809–1858) he demonstrated that the ratio of electrostatic to electromagnetic units produced a number that matched the speed of light. This finding led to Maxwell&#x27;s conjecture that light is an electromagnetic wave. This also led to Weber&#x27;s development of his theory of electrodynamics. Also, the first usage of the letter &quot;c&quot; to denote the speed of light was in an 1856 paper by Kohlrausch and Weber.

==International recognition==

The SI unit of magnetic flux, the weber (symbol: Wb) is named after him.

<text>HMS &quot;Carnarvon&quot; was one of six armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She was assigned to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet upon completion in 1905 and was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet in 1907. She was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet in 1909 and became flagship of the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the reserve Second Fleet in 1912.

When World War I began in August 1914, she was assigned to the Cape Verde Station to search for German commerce raiders while protecting British shipping. &quot;Carnarvon&quot; was transferred to the South Atlantic two months later and assigned to the squadron that destroyed the German East Asia Squadron at the Battle of the Falklands. She was assigned to the North America and West Indies Station in 1915 and continued to patrol against German raiders and escort convoys to the end of the war. In 1919, she became a training ship and was then sold for scrap in 1921.

==Design and description==
&quot;Carnarvon&quot; was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by seventeen Niclausse and six cylindrical boilers. She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 610 officers and ratings.

Her main armament consisted of four breech-loading (BL) 7.5-inch Mk I guns mounted in four single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and one on each side. The guns fired their shells to a range of about . Her secondary armament of six BL 6-inch Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships. Four of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. They had a maximum range of approximately with their shells. &quot;Carnarvon&quot; also carried eighteen quick-firing (QF) 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes. Her two 12-pounder 8 cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore.

At some point in the war, the main deck six-inch guns of the &quot;Devonshire&quot;-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve seakeeping and the four 3-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were landed.

The ship&#x27;s waterline armour belt ranged from in thickness and was closed off by transverse bulkheads. The armour of the gun turrets was also five inches thick whilst that of their barbettes was six inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour.

==Construction and service==
&quot;Carnarvon&quot;, named to commemorate the Welsh county, was laid down by William Beardmore &amp; Company at their Dalmuir shipyard on 1 October 1902 and launched on 7 October 1903. She was completed on 29 May 1905 and was initially assigned to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. She was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet in June 1907 and was then assigned to the reserve Third Fleet at Devonport in April 1909. The ship was transferred to the Second Fleet at Devonport in March 1912 and subsequently became the flagship of the 5th Cruiser Squadron until the start of World War I. She participated in the fleet manoeuvres in July–August 1913 as well as those in July 1914. On 31 July, a few days before war was declared on Germany, she encountered the German light cruiser in the English Channel returning home and the two ships saluted each other.

When news of the outbreak of hostilities was received on 5 August, &quot;Carnarvon&quot;, now the flagship of Rear Admiral Archibald Stoddart, was at sea, making for the Canary Islands from Gibraltar. She was quickly sent to Cape Verde and captured the German merchant ship on 23 August 1914. She escorted her prize to Freetown, Sierra Leone for disposal and resumed patrolling. She moved to the Brazilian coast in October and then proceeded to the Falkland Islands with the squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Doveton Sturdee.

===Battle of the Falklands===

Upon arrival at Port Stanley on 7 December, Sturdee informed his captains that he planned to recoal the entire squadron the following day from the two available colliers and to begin the search for the East Asia Squadron, believed to be running for home around the tip of South America, the day after. Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, had other plans and intended to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley on the morning of 8 December. The appearance of two German ships at 07:30 caught Sturdee&#x27;s ships by surprise, but the Germans were driven off by shells fired by the predreadnought battleship when they came within range around 09:20. &quot;Carnarvon&quot; completed recoaling at 08:00 and the squadron cleared the harbour by 10:30. Sturdee ordered &quot;general chase&quot; at that time, but &quot;Carnarvon&quot; could only manage and fell behind the other British ships. His two battlecruisers were the fastest ships present and inexorably began to close on the German cruisers, opening fire at 12:55 that straddled the light cruiser , the rear ship in the German formation. It was clear to Spee that his ships could not outrun the battlecruisers and that the only hope for any of his ships to survive was to scatter. So he turned his two armoured cruisers around to buy time by engaging the battlecruisers and ordered his three light cruisers to disperse at 13:20. &quot;Carnarvon&quot;, now behind, had no hope of catching the scattering German ships and continued to trail the battlecruisers.

&quot;Carnarvon &quot;finally came within range of the German armoured cruisers and opened fire shortly before rolled over and capsized at 16:17. She then engaged until Sturdee ordered &quot;cease fire&quot; at 17:50. The German captain had started to scuttle his ship 10 minutes earlier when it was clear that the situation was hopeless and his ship sank at 18:00. &quot;Carnarvon&quot; rescued 20 survivors from &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, but only wreckage was visible when she later steamed through the area where &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; had sunk.

After the battle she participated in the hunt for the light cruiser that had escaped during the battle and investigated anchorages in Argentina, Chile and the island of South Georgia before proceeding north to Brazil in February. She struck a coral reef off the Abrolhos Archipelago on 22 February 1915 and had to be beached to avoid sinking. The ship received temporary repairs at Rio de Janeiro the following month. &quot;Carnarvon&quot; received permanent repairs in Montreal, Canada, from May to July after which she escorted several British H-class submarines from Halifax to the United Kingdom en route to Devonport. She then returned to Halifax where she was based for the rest of the year. Now assigned to the North America and West Indies Station, with its main base at the Royal Naval Dockyard in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, she resumed her duties protecting British shipping for the rest of the war. After the United States Navy destroyer USS Stewart grounded at Bermuda on 16 August 1917, a cricket team from &quot;Carnarvon&quot; played a match against one from &quot;Stewart&quot; at the Bermuda dockyard. In 1919, she began serving as a cadet training ship, remaining in that role until she was listed for sale in March 1921. &quot;Carnarvon&quot; was sold for scrap on 8 November 1921 and subsequently broken up in Germany.

<doc id="191813" wikidata="Q887716" url="?curid=191813" title="Leonard Wood">
<text>Leonard Wood (October 9, 1860 – August 7, 1927) was a United States Army major general, physician, and public official. He served as the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, Military Governor of Cuba, and Governor-General of the Philippines. He began his military career as an army doctor on the frontier, where he received the Medal of Honor. During the Spanish–American War, he commanded the Rough Riders, with Theodore Roosevelt as his second-in-command. Wood was bypassed for a major command in World War I, but then became a prominent Republican Party leader and a leading candidate for the 1920 presidential nomination.

Born in Winchester, New Hampshire, Wood became an army surgeon after earning a Doctor of Medicine degree from Harvard Medical School. He received the Medal of Honor for his role in the Apache Wars and became the personal physician to the President of the United States. At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Wood and Roosevelt organized the Rough Riders, a volunteer cavalry regiment. Wood was promoted to the rank of brigadier general during the war and fought in the Battle of San Juan Hill and other engagements. After the war, Wood served as the Military Governor of Cuba, where he instituted improvements to medical and sanitary conditions. President William Howard Taft made Wood the Army Chief of Staff in 1910, and Wood held that position until 1914. Several Republican leaders supported Wood for the role of commander of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I, but the Woodrow Wilson administration selected John J. Pershing.

After Roosevelt&#x27;s death in 1919, many of Roosevelt&#x27;s former supporters backed Wood for the presidential nomination at the 1920 Republican National Convention. Wood received the most votes on the first four ballots of the convention, but the Republicans nominated Warren G. Harding. Wood retired from the army in 1921 and was appointed Governor-General of the Philippines later that year. He held that position until his death in 1927.

Biographer Jack Lane sums up his importance:
==Early life and education==
Wood was born in Winchester, New Hampshire, on October 9, 1860, one of three children born to Dr. Charles Jewett Wood (1829–1880) and Caroline Elizabeth (Hagar) Wood (1836–1910). His family was of English descent, and Wood was descended from Mayflower passengers William White, Francis Cooke, Stephen Hopkins and Richard Warren. He served as Governor General of the Mayflower Society from 1915 to 1921. Wood was also a member of the General Society of Colonial Wars and the Sons of the Revolution. He was president of the Sons of the Revolution from 1910 to 1911.

Wood was raised in Pocasset, Massachusetts, and educated by a private tutor, then attended Pierce Academy in Middleborough, Massachusetts. Wood tried unsuccessfully for an appointment to the United States Naval Academy and considered going to sea on an Arctic expedition or as a commercial fisherman. In 1880, his sister Barbara died, followed soon after by the death of his father. Wood&#x27;s mother was able to support herself and Wood&#x27;s brother Jacob by taking in boarders, while Wood moved away to further his education and obtain a profession. With the assistance of a relative, Wood was introduced to wealthy businessman H. H. Hunnewell, a philanthropist who had provided college tuition for other promising young men. Hunnewell agreed to fund Wood&#x27;s education at Harvard Medical School, and Wood began attending courses in October 1880. According to Hunnewell, who considered his financial support to young men attending college loans and not grants, but did not attempt to obtain repayment, Wood was the only beneficiary who ever paid him back. Wood worked diligently and consistently improved his class standing to the point where he earned a scholarship that provided additional financial support for his studies.

In 1884, Wood received his MD degree. He interned at Boston City Hospital, but was fired near the end of the year for exceeding his authority by conducting surgical procedures without supervision. He then took over the struggling Boston office of a classmate who had been hired by the Southern Pacific Railway. Wood practiced medicine in late 1884 and into the following year, but business was not steady and he did not have a reliable income. In 1885, he completed the examinations for a commission in the Army Medical Corps, attracted to the military by the possibilities for immediate employment and a regular salary. He finished second of 59 applicants, but there was only one vacancy, so Wood was not immediately offered a commission.

==Early military career==

In June 1885, Wood was contracted by the U.S. Army to act as an assistant surgeon without rank, and he was posted to the Department of Arizona. In January 1877, Wood was nominated by the president for appointment in the U.S. Army as assistant surgeon with the rank of first lieutenant. His appointment was among several the United States Senate delayed confirming until July 27, 1886. Until that time, he continued as a contract surgeon and was stationed with the 4th Cavalry at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Wood participated in the last campaign against Geronimo in the summer of 1886.

===Medal of Honor action===
In 1898, Wood received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the 1886 Geronimo campaign, including carrying dispatches 100 miles through hostile territory, and commanding a detachment of the 8th Infantry Regiment whose officers had been killed in hand-to-hand combat against the Apaches. Nelson A. Miles, the overall commander of the expedition, and Henry Ware Lawton, Wood&#x27;s commander in the field, recommended Wood for a brevet promotion or a Medal of Honor, and lobbied persistently for 12 years until the medal was approved.

Citation for Medal of Honor
The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Assistant Surgeon Leonard Wood, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in the Summer of 1886, in action in the Apache Campaigns in Arizona Territory. Assistant Surgeon Wood voluntarily carried dispatches through a region infested with hostile Indians, making a journey of 70 miles in one night and walking 30 miles the next day. Also for several weeks, while in close pursuit of Geronimo&#x27;s band and constantly expecting an encounter, commanded a detachment of Infantry, which was then without an officer, and to the command of which he was assigned upon his own request.

Awarded for Actions During: Indian Campaigns Service: Army Unit: 4th U.S. Cavalry Date of Issue: April 8, 1898

In late July 1886, Wood&#x27;s appointment was confirmed and he received his commission as a first lieutenant. In February 1887, he was appointed acting captain and temporary medical director of the Department of Arizona during the illness of his superior. At the end of 1887, Wood&#x27;s medical duties took him to Fort Lowell, Arizona Territory, followed by duty at Fort Selden, Fort Stanton, and Fort Wingate, New Mexico. In 1888, Wood was assigned to surgeon&#x27;s duties at Fort McDowell, Arizona. In 1889, Wood was reassigned to the Presidio of San Francisco.

Wood was promoted to captain in 1891. In 1892, he was part of a contingent of Presidio soldiers that traveled to Benicia Barracks to assist units of the California National Guard during the conduct of their annual training encampment. 

===Georgia Tech football===

While stationed at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, Wood enrolled in graduate school at Georgia Tech in order to be eligible for the school&#x27;s football team. He organized the school&#x27;s 1893 team, served as coach, and played left guard. Wood led Georgia Tech to a 2–1–1 record, including a 28–6 victory over the University of Georgia.

==Spanish–American War==
Wood was personal physician to Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley through 1898. During his White House service, Wood developed a friendship with Theodore Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy. At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Wood and Roosevelt organized the 1st Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, popularly known as the Rough Riders. Wood successfully commanded the regiment during the June 24, 1898 Battle of Las Guasimas. When the brigade commander, Samuel B. M. Young, became ill, Wood received a field promotion to brigadier general of volunteers. He assumed command of 2nd Brigade, Cavalry Division, Fifth Army Corps (which included the Rough Riders) and led the brigade to a famous July 1, 1898, victory in the combined assaults on Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill that came to be known as the Battle of San Juan Heights.
After San Juan Heights, Wood led the 2nd Cavalry Brigade for the rest of the war. He stayed in Cuba afterward and was appointed military governor of Santiago later in 1898, then served as governor of Cuba from 1899 to 1902. In that capacity, he relied on his medical experience to institute improvements to medical and sanitary conditions. He also introduced numerous reforms similar to those of the Progressive Movement in the U.S., including improvements to the educational and court systems. Though he did institute these improvements, Wood&#x27;s motivations as military governor remain unclear. In a report to Washington in 1900, he outlined that Cuban stability would be reached when &quot;money can be borrowed at a reasonable rate of interest and when capital is willing to invest in the island.&quot; He was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army shortly before moving to his next assignment. On May 15, 1902, prior to leaving office as military governor, Wood issued an order excluding Chinese immigrants.

==Philippine–American War==
Wood visited several European countries in 1902. His tour included reviewing German troops during Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s annual parade in August, which he attended with Samuel B. M. Young and Henry C. Corbin, and a tour of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Military College at Sandhurst in November. In 1903, Wood proceeded to the Philippines during the Philippine–American War, where he served as governor of Moro Province until 1906, then commanded the Philippine Division from 1906 to 1908. He was promoted to major general in 1903 despite significant opposition from members of the United States Senate who believed he had not served long enough in the lower grades and had been promoted because of political influence, not merit. 

Wood received criticism for his command of U.S. Marines during the First Battle of Bud Dajo in March 1906, during which hundreds of women and children were killed. Though Wood did not directly command the assault, he took full responsibility for the resulting massacre, claiming that the high civilian casualties were the result of Moro men using women and children as human shields, as well as some Moro women dressing as men to join the fight. At Wood&#x27;s instigation, Governor-General Henry Clay Ide reported that the women and children killed were the result of collateral damage from artillery fire, but that there had been no massacre. Some of Wood&#x27;s critics accused him of being a &quot;glory hound&quot; for ordering Marines to storm the dormant volcano crater where the battle took place instead of besieging the Moro encampment. 

Due to the backlash over Bud Dajo, Wood resigned as governor of Moro Province in April 1906 and was succeeded by brigadier general Tasker H. Bliss. He returned to the United States in 1908 and was assigned to command the Department of the East, with headquarters in New York City. He remained in this post until 1910, when he was appointed Army Chief of Staff.

==Army Chief of Staff==

Wood was named Army Chief of Staff in 1910 by President William Howard Taft, whom he had met while both were in the Philippines; he is the only medical officer to have held the position. As Chief of Staff, Wood implemented several programs, among which were the forerunner of the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) program, and the Preparedness Movement, a campaign for universal military training and wartime conscription. The Preparedness Movement led to implementation of the Selective Service System shortly before World War I. As chief of staff, Wood reorganized the general staff into three divisions – Mobile Army, Coast Artillery, and War College – each headed by an assistant chief of staff. The three divisions he created did not last, but the overall result of his reorganization was the recognition that decentralization, which continued under his successors, enabled streamlined planning and decision making, which facilitated operations and training as the army began to prepare for U.S. entry into the war.

==Commander of Army Eastern Department==
In 1914, Wood completed his term as chief of staff and was succeeded by William Wallace Wotherspoon. As commander of the army&#x27;s Eastern Department for the second time, Wood was a strong advocate of the Preparedness Movement, led by Republicans, which alienated him from President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat who pursued an isolationist and pacifist foreign policy. Wood made speeches and wrote articles to advocate preparedness and in 1915 a collection of these works were published as a pro-preparedness book, &quot;The Military Obligation of Citizenship&quot;. In 1916 he was elected as an honorary member of the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati. He served as a member of Harvard University&#x27;s board of overseers from 1917 to 1923.

==World War I==

With American entry into World War I looming in early 1917, the most likely choice to lead American forces in France was Major General Frederick Funston. Funston died of a heart attack in February, leaving President Woodrow Wilson to choose from among the army&#x27;s six other major generals. Wood was recommended by several prominent Republicans, including Henry Cabot Lodge. Despite this support, when the U.S. entered the war in April, Wood&#x27;s prior criticism of the Wilson administration led Secretary of War Newton D. Baker to recommend John J. Pershing, the most junior of the serving major generals and a Republican, but one who had been less vocal than Wood.

During the war Wood was relegated to stateside roles, including command of the Southern Department in 1917. He then commanded the 89th and 10th Divisions, which he organized and trained at Camp Funston, Kansas. While on an inspection tour of the Western Front in January 1918, Wood was slightly injured by shrapnel from a US mortar round that exploded during a test. Wood was preparing to travel to France with the 89th Division in May 1918 when he was relieved by Wilson. He was disappointed at being continued in stateside service, but effectively organized and trained the 10th Division. During most of the war, Wood&#x27;s aide-de-camp was John C. H. Lee, who attained the rank of lieutenant general during World War II.

Wood received the Army Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Honor (Grand Officer) from France to recognize his superior service during the war. The citation for his Army DSM reads:

After the war, Wood was appointed to command the Sixth Corps Area, which he led from 1919 to 1921.

==1920 presidential campaign==

After having considered a presidential candidacy in 1916, in 1920 Wood was a serious contender for the Republican nomination. The major candidates were Senator Hiram Johnson of California, a progressive who opposed U.S. involvement in the League of Nations; Governor Frank Orren Lowden of Illinois, who supported women&#x27;s suffrage and Prohibition, and opposed U.S. entry into the League of Nations; and Wood, whose military career made him the personification of competence and ties to Theodore Roosevelt earned him the backing of many of Roosevelt&#x27;s former supporters, including William Cooper Procter. Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio was a dark horse candidate, running as a favorite son in order to maintain his hold on Ohio&#x27;s Republican Party and secure his reelection to the Senate. At the convention, Wood led on the first four ballots, was second on the fifth, tied for first with Lowden on the sixth, and led again on the seventh. With none of the three front runners able to obtain a majority, support for Harding started to grow and he won the nomination on the tenth ballot. Delegates nominated Calvin Coolidge for vice president, and the Harding-Coolidge ticket went on to win the general election.

==Governor-General of the Philippines==

Wood retired from the U.S. Army in 1921, after which he was chosen to serve as provost of the University of Pennsylvania. The college granted him a leave of absence before he assumed the position, enabling him to carry out a one-year appointment as Governor General of the Philippines. In 1922 he decided to remain in the Philippines, so he resigned the provost&#x27;s position.

His tenure in the Philippines was characterized by marked tension between him and key Filipino officials. In his first year, Wood vetoed 16 measures passed by the Philippine Legislature, an act denounced by critics as a &quot;misuse of the veto power&quot; when they noted that his predecessor, Francis Burton Harrison, had vetoed only five measures during his entire seven and a half year governorship.

The tension between Wood and Filipino members of the government became more heightened in 1923, precipitated by Wood&#x27;s actions with respect to Ray Conley, a Manila Police detective who was accused of immorality and misconduct in office. Interior Secretary Jose P. Laurel sought Conley&#x27;s removal but Wood ordered Laurel to reinstate him. Laurel then tendered his resignation. The Filipino members of the Wood cabinet, including the entire Council of State, tendered their resignations to protest Wood&#x27;s actions. These events, the &quot;Cabinet Crisis of 1923&quot;, strained relations between the U.S. colonial government under Wood and Filipino leaders, which lasted until his death in 1927.

==Death and burial==

Wood was diagnosed in 1910 with a benign meningioma, which was successfully resected by Harvey Cushing. He made a full recovery, but the tumor later recurred. Wood died in Boston on August 7, 1927, during surgery on the brain tumor. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 21, Grave S-10.

The successful removal of Wood&#x27;s first brain tumor represented an important milestone, indicating to the public the advances that had been made in the nascent field of neurosurgery and extending Wood&#x27;s life by almost two decades. His brain is held at the Yale University School of Medicine as part of an historic collection of Harvey Cushing&#x27;s patients&#x27; preserved brains.

==Family==

Wood was serving in Monterey, California, in 1888 when he met Louise Adriana Condit Smith (1869–1943), who was vacationing with her uncle and legal guardian, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Johnson Field. They married in Washington, DC on November 18, 1890, with the entire Supreme Court in attendance. 

The Woods had three children:
* Leonard Wood Jr. (1892–1931) was a Cornell University graduate who attained the rank of captain while serving in the Army during World War I, but was plagued by financial difficulties and ill health afterwards.
* Osborne Cutler Wood (1897–1950) left Harvard University to serve in World War I, and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel after the war. After leaving the Army he relocated to New Mexico, where he was commissioned as a brigadier general and appointed as adjutant general of the New Mexico National Guard.
* Louise Barbara Wood (1900–1960) served with Anne Morgan&#x27;s American Friends in France relief organization during World War I. Louise Wood took an interest in preserving her father&#x27;s legacy. In 1952, she attended the opening of a park in Cuba which included a plaque commemorating her father&#x27;s Spanish-American War service and the shack in which Walter Reed conducted the research that proved mosquitoes are the cause of malaria.

==Legacy==
In 1925, Dorothy Wade, wife of the head doctor at the Culion leper colony, and fundraiser Perry Burgess created a charitable committee that after Wood&#x27;s death became the Leonard Wood Memorial for the Eradication of Leprosy. The Wood Memorial supported leper colonies in Culion and Cebu, held the first international conference on leprosy in Manila in 1931, and helped support the International Leprosy Foundation. A statue of Wood was erected at Culion in 1931.

In January 1941, the newly constructed Seventh Corps Area Training Center in Missouri was designated Fort Leonard Wood.

<text>Marciano Cantero (born Horacio Eduardo Cantero Hernández, 25 August 1960 – 8 September 2022) was an Argentine musician. He was the lead singer and bassist of Enanitos Verdes, an Argentine pop/rock band.

==Biography==

Cantero was nine when he first heard the Beatles and The Beach Boys, which he credits as one of his most important influences in his music. Cantero bought a bass guitar that was on sale with his savings, and started to practice with the instrument, helped by his older brother. After graduating high school, his father bought him a brand new bass guitar. He also started attending concerts in the underground circuit during the civil military dictatorship of Argentina.

In 1979, he joined Felipe Staiti and Daniel Piccolo to form Enanitos Verdes (lit. &quot;Little Green Dwarves&quot;, but more accurately considered equivalent to the phrase &quot;Little Green Men&quot;); they struggled at first, but eventually became idols in Mendoza. They later moved to Buenos Aires, where they also struggled performing in bars and clubs before recording their first album. After a label change, the Enanitos began their internationalization with CBS Argentina and became famous around Latin America.

In 1990, Cantero started his solo career, recording &quot;Luna Nueva&quot; (1990) and Beat Club (1991). After that Marciano recorded numerous albums with &quot;Enanitos Verdes&quot; as well as releasing a Greatest Hits compilation in 1995, a Live CD in 2005, and their newest album titled &quot;Pescado Original&quot; in 2006 which includes the hit &quot;Mariposas&quot;.

He lived in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. In 2022, he returned to his birthplace, Mendoza, where he lived until his death.

== Illness and death ==
On 5 September 2022, he was hospitalized due to kidney illness. A surgery was performed, one kidney and part of his spleen were removed. He died three days later, on 8 September 2022, at the age of 62.

<text>Robert C. Christie Hunter (born Robert Burns; June 23, 1941 – September 23, 2019) was an American lyricist, singer-songwriter, translator and poet, best known for his work with the Grateful Dead. Born near San Luis Obispo, California, Hunter spent some time during his childhood in foster homes as a result of his father abandoning his family, and took refuge in reading and writing. He attended the University of Connecticut for a year before returning to Palo Alto, where he became friends with musician Jerry Garcia. Hunter and Garcia began a collaboration that lasted through the remainder of Garcia&#x27;s life.

Garcia and others formed the Grateful Dead in 1965, and later began working with lyrics from Hunter, whom Garcia invited to join the band as a lyricist. Hunter contributed substantially to many of their albums, beginning with &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot; in 1969. He wrote lyrics to a number of the band&#x27;s signature songs, including &quot;Dark Star&quot;, &quot;Ripple&quot;, &quot;Truckin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;China Cat Sunflower&quot;, and &quot;Terrapin Station&quot;. Hunter was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Grateful Dead in 1994, and is the only non-performer to be inducted as a member of a band. Upon his death, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described him as &quot;one of rock&#x27;s most ambitious and dazzling lyricists&quot;.

==Early life==
Hunter was born Robert Burns on June 23, 1941, in Arroyo Grande, California, near San Luis Obispo. He was a great-great-grandson of the Romantic poet Robert Burns, according to Charles Perry. Hunter&#x27;s father was an alcoholic, who deserted the family when Hunter was seven, according to Grateful Dead chronicler Dennis McNally. Hunter spent the next few years in foster homes before returning to live with his mother. These experiences drove him to seek refuge in books, and he wrote a 50-page fairy tale before he was 11. His mother married again, to Norman Hunter, whose last name Robert took. The elder Hunter was a publisher, who gave Robert lessons in writing. Hunter attended high school in Palo Alto, learning to play several instruments as a teenager. His family moved to Connecticut, where he attended the University of Connecticut. He played trumpet in a band called the Crescents. Hunter left the university after a year, and returned to Palo Alto. He enlisted in the National Guard, and spent six months training, before doing a six-month tour of duty.

Upon his return to Palo Alto, in 1961 he was introduced to Jerry Garcia by Garcia&#x27;s then-girlfriend, who had previously been in a relationship with Hunter. Garcia was 18 and Hunter 19. The duo began to perform together, spending their time in &quot;what passed for Palo Alto&#x27;s 1961 bohemian community&quot;, including a bookstore run by Roy Kepler. They formed a short-lived duo called &quot;Bob and Jerry&quot; that debuted at the graduation ceremony of the Quaker Peninsula School on May 5, 1961. According to McNally, the group did not last because of &quot;Hunter&#x27;s limits as a guitarist and Garcia&#x27;s ravenous drive to get better,&quot; but the two remained friendly. Garcia became involved with bluegrass groups in the area such as the Thunder Mountain Tub Thumpers and the Wildwood Boys; Hunter sometimes played the mandolin with these groups, but was more interested in writing. By 1962, he had written a book, &quot;The Silver Snarling Trumpet&quot;, described by McNally as a roman à clef. McNally writes that it shows Hunter&#x27;s &quot;skill at storytelling and his fantastic ear for dialogue&quot;. Recordings of folk and bluegrass bands that included Hunter and Garcia were later released on two albums – &quot;Folk Time&quot; (2016) and &quot;Before the Dead&quot; (2018).

Around 1962, Hunter volunteered for psychedelic chemical experiments at Stanford University, research covertly sponsored by the CIA in its MKULTRA program: other participants included Ken Kesey and Allen Ginsberg. He was paid to take LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, and then report on his experiences, which were creatively formative for him. After a friend attempted to dissuade him, he said, &quot;It&#x27;ll be fun! I&#x27;ll take my typewriter and no telling what&#x27;ll come out.&quot; This incident was the first substantial experience any of the Grateful Dead had with psychedelic drugs, and the creative surge he experienced would prove influential on their collective outlook. Around this time, Hunter was briefly involved with Scientology, and also struggled with addiction to methamphetamine and speed, which drove him to move briefly to Los Angeles and then to New Mexico. Some of his hallucinations later inspired his lyrics, such as those to &quot;China Cat Sunflower&quot;.

== Grateful Dead ==

While Hunter was in New Mexico, he wrote lyrics for three songs. These songs—&quot;China Cat Sunflower&quot;, &quot;St. Stephen&quot;, and &quot;Alligator&quot;—would become hits for the Grateful Dead. In 1965, Garcia, Ron McKernan, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh and Bill Kreutzmann formed a band, initially called the Warlocks, but soon renamed the Grateful Dead. They covered songs from other artists but soon began to form their own sound. They recorded and released their first album, which included only two original songs, but soon afterward began to develop more of their own, and started work on &quot;Alligator&quot;, using Hunter&#x27;s lyrics. As a result, they invited Hunter to join them in San Francisco to be their lyricist. He joined the Grateful Dead at a concert in Rio Nido, California, where he wrote the lyrics that later became &quot;Dark Star&quot;.

Hunter played a minimal role in the Grateful Dead&#x27;s next album, &quot;Anthem of the Sun&quot;, but he and Garcia worked together to write every song on &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot;, which came after it. Although their musical style was developing, the album produced several popular songs, including &quot;China Cat Sunflower&quot;, which became an enduring part of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s repertoire. A few months before &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot; was released, Hunter and his then-partner Christie Bourne began sharing a house with Garcia, his wife, and his step-daughter. Living in close proximity gave additional impetus to their collaborative songwriting. Hunter&#x27;s relationship with the band grew until he was officially a non-performing band member. The band&#x27;s reputation also grew; in 1970, a group led by Miles Davis opened a concert for the band.

After &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot;, the band shifted from an experimentalist approach toward Americana and country music, featured in their albums &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot;. This period produced some of their most successful songs, including &quot;Cumberland Blues&quot;, &quot;Box of Rain&quot;, and &quot;Sugar Magnolia&quot;. Many of these pieces were written by Hunter and would go on to become enduring folk songs; according to McNally, pieces such as &quot;Ripple&quot; grew to be &quot;part of the American canon.&quot; The band&#x27;s composition methods were varied. Hunter sometimes wrote lyrics the others composed music around; sometimes, he wrote lyrics to music; and sometimes, the group worked together to create music and lyrics simultaneously. Their musical improvisation was often inspired by psychedelic experiences under the influence of LSD, and by other hallucinatory experiences: Hunter wrote &quot;Dire Wolf&quot; inspired by a dream after watching a film adaptation of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;.

Hunter&#x27;s participation in the Grateful Dead was dominated by his collaboration with Garcia, based on, according to McNally, &quot;friendship, common experience, Hunter&#x27;s extraordinary capacity for empathy, and his sterling ability to translate that into lyrics.&quot; He also worked with other band members; on &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot; he worked with McKernan on &quot;Easy Wind&quot;, and on &quot;American Beauty&quot;, with Lesh on &quot;Box of Rain&quot;, and Weir on &quot;Sugar Magnolia&quot;. He eventually decided he could only work with Garcia, and the duo wrote numerous songs together over the next 25 years. Their relationship was often challenged by Garcia&#x27;s difficulties with drug addiction; in 2015, Hunter said he was unhappy with the extent of cocaine use among band members in the mid-1970s. Hunter was described as a &quot;proudly irascible&quot; presence in the band, who would often veto attempts to use the band&#x27;s songs for commercial purposes. After Garcia&#x27;s death from a heart attack at a heroin rehabilitation clinic in 1995, the Grateful Dead disbanded.

== Collaborations ==
Following the dissolution of the Grateful Dead, Hunter successfully continued his writing career, working on new songs with Jim Lauderdale, Elvis Costello, Cesar Rosas, and Bruce Hornsby, among others. He was seen occasionally playing solo acoustic guitar and performing his classic works, as well as newer songs. In 2004 he opened most of the summer tour of the Dead (a group made up of former Grateful Dead members). He also co-wrote, with David Nelson, many of the songs on the New Riders of the Purple Sage albums &quot;Where I Come From&quot; (2009) and &quot;17 Pine Avenue&quot; (2012). Hunter wrote &quot;Cyclone&quot; for Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers&#x27; &quot;Levitate&quot; album, released in 2009. Asked in a 2009 interview about some of the song&#x27;s more &quot;philosophical&quot; lyrics, such as the line &quot;I&#x27;ve got no answers of my own, and none have been provided&quot;, Hornsby said, &quot;You know those are Robert Hunter&#x27;s lyrics with a couple of additions from me.&quot; Hornsby commented on his work for &quot;Levitate&quot; (&quot;Cyclone&quot;), saying, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve always loved [Robert Hunter&#x27;s] writing. I&#x27;ve loved so many of the Garcia/Hunter songs. They&#x27;re just timeless sounding to me, could have been written hundreds of years ago. I had this song that had the same feeling as, say, &#x27;Brokedown Palace&#x27;.&quot;

Hunter collaborated with Bob Dylan on multiple occasions; he co-wrote two songs on Dylan&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Down in the Groove&quot;, all but one of the songs on Dylan&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Together Through Life&quot;, and &quot;Duquesne Whistle&quot; from Dylan&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Tempest&quot;. &quot;We could probably write a hundred songs together if we thought it was important or the right reasons were there,&quot; Dylan said of working with him in 2009. Hunter co-wrote the songs for two Jim Lauderdale albums – &quot;Patchwork River&quot; (2010) and &quot;Carolina Moonrise&quot; (2012). Hunter later said that working with Lauderdale was a productive experience, as they both liked working quickly, and wrote an album in a couple of days. Also in 2010 Hunter co-wrote the song &quot;All My Bridges Burning&quot; with Cesar Rosas for the Los Lobos&#x27; album &quot;Tin Can Trust&quot;. In the same year, Hunter wrote lyrics for 7 Walkers&#x27; debut album, including &quot;Louisiana Rain&quot;, &quot;Chingo&quot;, and &quot;Sue From Bogalusa&quot;. In 2012, Hunter co-wrote lyrics for the Mickey Hart Band&#x27;s albums &quot;Mysterium Tremendum&quot; and the follow-up &quot;Superorganism&quot;. In an interview with &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, Hart categorized Hunter&#x27;s lyrics compared to other great lyricists saying, &quot;When you&#x27;re in a situation in the future and you can&#x27;t explain it, very often a Hunter line or two or three will explain something that&#x27;s unexplainable.&quot; Also in 2012, Hunter co-wrote four songs on Little Feat&#x27;s album &quot;Rooster Rag&quot;.

== Awards and legacy ==
When the Grateful Dead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, Hunter was included as a band member, the only non-performer to ever be so honored. In 2013, Hunter received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Americana Music Association. He performed &quot;Ripple&quot; from the Grateful Dead&#x27;s album &quot;American Beauty&quot;. In 2015, Hunter and Garcia were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Hunter accepted the award along with Garcia&#x27;s daughter, Trixie Garcia, accepting on behalf of her father. Hunter once again performed &quot;Ripple&quot;. Hunter said his &quot;pretty much&quot; favorite line he wrote was in &quot;Ripple&quot;: &quot;Let it be known there is a fountain that was not made by the hands of men&quot;. &quot;And I believe it, you know?&quot; he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2015.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Hunter&#x27;s lyrics &quot;helped define the Grateful Dead as a counterculture touchstone&quot;. Analyzing his lyrics became a popular exercise among the band&#x27;s fans, something Hunter took pride in. His approach to songwriting is described as &quot;deeply literary&quot;, and responsible for differentiating the music of the Grateful Dead from mainstream popular music. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; compared his lyrical aesthetic to that of Bob Dylan and Randy Newman, and wrote he was one of the few lyricists who &quot;delved into the unique characteristics of the American psyche&quot;. Hunter was the only writer to collaborate extensively with Dylan. During the 2000s, Dylan said Hunter had &quot;a way with words&quot;, and &quot;we both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting.&quot; Hunter was famously averse to explaining his lyrics and avoided interviews.

Dennis McNally, author of a history of the Grateful Dead, said the band only &quot;developed their potential for greatness&quot; after they made Hunter their main lyricist. McNally writes that while Garcia was one of the &quot;outstanding guitar players and songwriters of his generation&quot;, his lyrical abilities were minor. Many of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s early lyrics were &quot;superficial&quot; and simple. From Hunter and Garcia&#x27;s collaboration came many of the songs McNally calls the band&#x27;s masterpieces, including &quot;Ripple&quot;, &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot;, and &quot;Attics of My Life&quot;. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;[considered] one of rock&#x27;s most ambitious and dazzling lyricists, Hunter was the literary counterpoint to the band&#x27;s musical experimentation&quot;, and his lyrics were &quot;as much a part of the band as Jerry Garcia&#x27;s singing and guitar.&quot;

After his death, his widow, Maureen, discovered a manuscript that details the Grateful Dead&#x27;s history to Hunter’s first encounter with guitarist Jerry Garcia in Palo Alto in 1961. This manuscript will be published posthumously.

== Personal life and death ==
Hunter married artist Maureen Hunter in 1982, and they had three children. One of these children, a son, died in the late 80s. His youngest child was born in 1991. Although an early member of the Church of Scientology, by 1999, Hunter no longer belonged to the organization. In 2013, he was compelled to go on a solo tour as a result of medical bills, after surviving a spinal cord abscess in the previous year. Hunter died at his home in San Rafael, California on September 23, 2019. He had had recent surgery before his death. Upon hearing news of his demise, tributes and remembrances were shared from his former bandmates Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, and Phil Lesh, alongside other musicians Jim Lauderdale, Trey Anastasio, John Mayer, Oteil Burbridge and Warren Haynes.

<doc id="191819" wikidata="Q157155" url="?curid=191819" title="Ernest Renan">
<text>Joseph Ernest Renan (; 27 February 18232 October 1892) was a French Orientalist and Semitic scholar, writing on Semitic languages and civilizations, historian of religion, philologist, philosopher, biblical scholar, and critic. He wrote works on the origins of early Christianity, and espoused popular political theories especially concerning nationalism, national identity, and the alleged superiority of White people over other human &quot;races&quot;. Renan is known as being among the first scholars to advance the debunked Khazar theory, which held that Ashkenazi Jews were descendants of the Khazars, Turkic peoples who had adopted the Jewish religion and allegedly migrated to central and eastern Europe following the collapse of their khanate.

==Life==
===Birth and family===

He was born at Tréguier in Brittany to a family of fishermen. His grandfather, having made a small fortune with his fishing smack, bought a house at Tréguier and settled there, and his father, captain of a small cutter and an ardent republican, married the daughter of a Royalist tradesman from the neighbouring town of Lannion. All his life, Renan was aware of the conflict between his father&#x27;s and his mother&#x27;s political beliefs. He was five years old when his father died, and his sister, Henriette, twelve years his senior, became the moral head of the household. Having in vain attempted to keep a school for girls at Tréguier, she departed and went to Paris as a teacher in a young ladies&#x27; boarding-school.

===Education===
Ernest was educated in the ecclesiastical seminary of his native town. His school reports describe him as &quot;docile, patient, diligent, painstaking, thorough&quot;. While the priests taught him mathematics and Latin, his mother completed his education. Renan&#x27;s mother was half Breton. Her paternal ancestors came from Bordeaux, and Renan used to say that in his own nature, the Gascon and the Breton were constantly at odds.

During the summer of 1838, Renan won all the prizes at the college of Tréguier. His sister told the doctor of the school in Paris where she taught about her brother, and he informed F. A. P. Dupanloup, who was involved in organizing the ecclesiastical college of Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet, a school in which the young Catholic nobility and the most talented pupils of the Catholic seminaries were to be educated together, with the idea of creating friendships between the aristocracy and the priesthood. Dupanloup sent for Renan, who was then fifteen years old and had never been outside Brittany. &quot;I learned with stupor that knowledge was not a privilege of the Church ... I awoke to the meaning of the words talent, fame, celebrity.&quot; Religion seemed to him wholly different in Tréguier and in Paris. He came to view Abbé Dupanloup as a father figure.

===Study at Issy-les-Moulineaux===
In 1840, Renan left St Nicholas to study philosophy at the seminary of Issy-les-Moulineaux. He entered with a passion for Catholic scholasticism. Among the philosophers, Thomas Reid and Nicolas Malebranche first attracted him, and, then he turned to G. W. F. Hegel, Immanuel Kant and J. G. Herder. Renan began to see a contradiction between the metaphysics which he studied and the faith he professed, but an appetite for verifiable truths restrained his scepticism. &quot;Philosophy excites and only half satisfies the appetite for truth; I am eager for mathematics&quot;, he wrote to Henriette. Henriette had accepted in the family of Count Zamoyski an engagement more lucrative than her former job. She exercised the strongest influence over her brother.

===Study at college of St Sulpice===
It was not mathematics but philology which was to settle Renan&#x27;s gathering doubts. His course completed at Issy, in 1844 he entered the college of St Sulpice in order to take his degree in philology prior to entering the church, and, here, he began the study of Hebrew. He realized that the second part of the &quot;Book of Isaiah&quot; differs from the first not only in style but in date, that the grammar and the history of the &quot;Pentateuch&quot; are later than the time of Moses, and that the &quot;Book of Daniel&quot; is clearly written centuries after the time in which it is set. At night he read the new novels of Victor Hugo; by day, he studied Hebrew and Syriac under Arthur-Marie Le Hir. In October 1845, Renan left St Sulpice for Stanislas, a lay college of the Oratorians. Still feeling too much under the domination of the church, he reluctantly ended the last of his associations with religious life and entered M. Crouzet&#x27;s school for boys as a teacher.

===Scholarly career===

Renan, educated by priests, was to accept the scientific ideal with an extraordinary expansion of all his faculties. He became ravished by the splendor of the cosmos. At the end of his life, he wrote of Amiel, &quot;The man who has time to keep a private diary has never understood the immensity of the universe.&quot; The certitudes of physical and natural science were revealed to Renan in 1846 by the chemist Marcellin Berthelot, then a young man of eighteen, his pupil at M. Crouzet&#x27;s school. To the day of Renan&#x27;s death, their friendship continued. Renan was occupied as usher only during evenings. During the daytime, he continued his researches in Semitic philology. In 1847, he obtained the Volney prize, one of the principal distinctions awarded by the Academy of Inscriptions, for the manuscript of his &quot;General History of Semitic Languages.&quot; In 1847, he took his degree as &quot;Agrégé de Philosophie&quot; – that is to say, fellow of the university – and was offered a job as master in the &quot;lycée&quot; Vendôme.

In 1856, Renan married in Paris Cornélie Scheffer, daughter of Hendrik Scheffer and niece of Ary Scheffer, both French painters of Dutch descent. They had two children, Ary Renan, born in 1858, who became a painter, and Noémi, born in 1862, who eventually married philologist Yannis Psycharis. In 1863, the American Philosophical Society elected him an international Member.

====&quot;Life of Jesus&quot;====
Within his lifetime, Renan was best known as the author of the enormously popular &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; (&quot;Vie de Jésus&quot;, 1863). Renan attributed the idea of the book to his sister, Henriette, with whom he was traveling in Ottoman Syria and Palestine when, struck with a fever, she died suddenly. With only a New Testament and copy of Josephus as references, he began writing. The book was first translated into English in the year of its publication by Charles E. Wilbour and has remained in print for the past 145 years. Renan&#x27;s &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; was lavished with ironic praise and criticism by Albert Schweitzer in his book &quot;The Quest of the Historical Jesus&quot;.

Renan argued Jesus was able to purify himself of &quot;Jewish traits&quot; and that he became an Aryan. His &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; promoted racial ideas and infused race into theology and the person of Jesus; he depicted Jesus as a Galilean who was transformed from a Jew into a Christian, and that Christianity emerged purified of any Jewish influences. The book was based largely on the Gospel of John, and was a scholarly work. It depicted Jesus as a man but not God, and rejected the miracles of the Gospel. Renan believed by humanizing Jesus he was restoring to him a greater dignity. The book&#x27;s controversial assertions that the life of Jesus should be written like the life of any historic person, and that the Bible could and should be subject to the same critical scrutiny as other historical documents caused controversy and enraged many Christians and Jews because of its depiction of Judaism as foolish and absurdly illogical and for its insistence that Jesus and Christianity were superior.

American historian George Mosse, in &quot;Toward the Final Solution. A History of European Racism&quot; (pp 88, 129–130) argues that according to Renan, the intolerance would be a Jewish and not a Christian characteristic, but biblical Judaism would have lost its importance even among the Jews themselves as civilization progressed. That is why modern Jews are no longer disadvantaged by their past and are able to make important contributions to modern progress.

===Continuation of scholarly career: social views===
In his book on St. Paul, as in the Apostles, he shows his concern with the larger social life, his sense of fraternity, and a revival of the democratic sentiment which had inspired &quot;L&#x27;Avenir de la Science&quot;. In 1869, he presented himself as the candidate of the liberal opposition at the parliamentary election for Meaux. While his temper had become less aristocratic, his liberalism had grown more tolerant. On the eve of its dissolution, Renan was half prepared to accept the Empire, and, had he been elected to the Chamber of Deputies, he would have joined the group of &quot;l&#x27;Empire liberal&quot;, but he was not elected. A year later, war was declared with Germany; the Empire was abolished, and Napoleon III became an exile. The Franco-Prussian War was a turning-point in Renan&#x27;s history. Germany had always been to him the asylum of thought and disinterested science. Now, he saw the land of his ideal destroy and ruin the land of his birth; he beheld the German no longer as a priest, but as an invader.
In &quot;La Réforme Intellectuelle et Morale&quot; (1871), Renan tried to safeguard France&#x27;s future. Yet, he was still influenced by Germany. The ideal and the discipline which he proposed to his defeated country were those of her conqueror—a feudal society, a monarchical government, an elite which the rest of the nation exists merely to support and nourish; an ideal of honor and duty imposed by a chosen few on the recalcitrant and subject multitude. The errors attributed to the &quot;Commune&quot; confirmed Renan in this reaction. At the same time, the irony always perceptible in his work grows more bitter. His &quot;Dialogues Philosophiques&quot;, written in 1871, his &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot; (1882) and his &quot;Antichrist&quot; (1876) (the fourth volume of the &quot;Origins of Christianity&quot;, dealing with the reign of Nero) are incomparable in their literary genius, but they are examples of a disenchanted and sceptical temper. He had vainly tried to make his country obey his precepts. The progress of events showed him, on the contrary, a France which, every day, left a little stronger, and he roused himself from his disbelieving, disillusioned mood and observed with interest the struggle for justice and liberty of a democratic society. The fifth and sixth volumes of the &quot;Origins of Christianity&quot; (the Christian Church and Marcus Aurelius) show him reconciled with democracy, confident in the gradual ascent of man, aware that the greatest catastrophes do not really interrupt the sure if imperceptible progress of the world and reconciled, also, if not with the truths, at least with the moral beauties of Catholicism and with the remembrance of his pious youth.

====Definition of nationhood====
Renan&#x27;s definition of a nation has been extremely influential. This was given in his 1882 discourse &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce qu&#x27;une nation?&quot; (&quot;What is a Nation?&quot;). Whereas German writers like Fichte had defined the nation by objective criteria such as a race or an ethnic group &quot;sharing common characteristics&quot; (language, etc.), Renan defined it by the desire of a people to live together, which he summarized by a famous phrase, &quot;having done great things together and wishing to do more&quot;. Writing in the midst of the dispute concerning the Alsace-Lorraine region, he declared that the existence of a nation was based on a &quot;daily plebiscite.&quot; Some authors criticize that definition, based on a &quot;daily plebiscite&quot;, because of the ambiguity of the concept. They argue that this definition is an idealization and it should be interpreted within the German tradition and not in opposition to it. They say that the arguments used by Renan at the conference &quot; What is a Nation? &quot; are not consistent with his thinking.

Karl Deutsch (in &quot;Nationalism and its alternatives&quot;) wrote &quot;&#x27;A Nation,&#x27; so goes a rueful European saying, &#x27;is a group of persons united by a common error about their ancestry and a common dislike of their neighbors.&#x27;&quot; This phrase is frequently, but mistakenly, attributed to Renan himself. He did indeed write that if &quot;the essential element of a nation is that all its individuals must have many things in common&quot;, they &quot;must also have forgotten many things. Every French citizen must have forgotten the night of St. Bartholomew and the massacres in the 13th century in the South.&quot;

Renan believed &quot;Nations are not eternal. They had a beginning and they will have an end. And they will probably be replaced by a European confederation&quot;.

Renan&#x27;s work has especially influenced 20th-century theorist of nationalism Benedict Anderson.

===Late scholarly career===
Shifting away from his pessimism regarding liberalism&#x27;s prospects during the 1870s while still believing in the necessity of an intellectual elite to influence democratic society for the good, Renan rallied to support the French Third Republic, humorously describing himself as a &quot;légitimiste&quot;, that is, a person who needs &quot;about ten years to accustom myself to regarding any government as legitimate,&quot; and adding &quot;I, who am not a republican &quot;a priori&quot;, who am a simple Liberal quite willing to adjust myself to a constitutional monarchy, would be more loyal to the Republic than newly converted republicans.&quot; The progress of the sciences under the Republic and the latitude given to the freedom of thought that Renan cherished above all had allayed many of his previous fears, and he opposed the deterministic and fatalist theories of philosophers like Hippolyte Taine.

As he got older, he contemplated his childhood. He was nearly sixty when, in 1883, he published the autobiographical &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;Enfance et de Jeunesse&quot; which, after the &quot;Life of Jesus&quot;, is the work by which he is chiefly known.

They showed the blasé modern reader that a world no less poetic, no less primitive than that of the &quot;Origins of Christianity&quot; still existed within living memory on the northwestern coast of France. It has the Celtic magic of ancient romance and the simplicity, the naturalness, and the veracity which the 19th century prized so highly. But his &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot;, published a few months earlier, his &quot;Drames Philosophiques&quot;, collected in 1888, give a more adequate image of his fastidious critical, disenchanted, yet optimistic spirit. They show the attitude towards uncultured Socialism of a philosopher liberal by conviction, by temperament an aristocrat. We learn in them how Caliban (democracy), the mindless brute, educated to his own responsibility, makes after all an adequate ruler; how Prospero (the aristocratic principle or the mind) accepts his dethronement for the sake of greater liberty in the intellectual world, since Caliban proves an effective policeman and leaves his superiors a free hand in the laboratory; how Ariel (the religious principle) acquires a firmer hold on life and no longer gives up the ghost at the faintest hint of change. Indeed, Ariel flourishes in the service of Prospero under the external government of the many-headed brute. Religion and knowledge are as imperishable as the world they dignify. Thus, out of the depths rises unvanquished the essential idealism of Renan.

Renan was prolific. At sixty years of age, having finished the &quot;Origins of Christianity&quot;, he began his &quot;History of Israel&quot;, based on a lifelong study of the &quot;Old Testament&quot; and on the &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum&quot;, published by the Académie des Inscriptions under Renan&#x27;s direction from the year 1881 till the end of his life. The first volume of the &quot;History of Israel&quot; appeared in 1887; the third, in 1891; the last two posthumously. As a history of facts and theories, the book has many faults; as an essay on the evolution of the religious idea, it is (despite some passages of frivolity, irony, or incoherence) of extraordinary importance; as a reflection of the mind of Renan, it is the most lifelike of images. In a volume of collected essays, &quot;Feuilles Détachées&quot;, published also in 1891, we find the same mental attitude, an affirmation of the necessity of piety independent of dogma. During his last years, he received many honors, and was made an administrator of the Collège de France and grand officer of the Legion of Honor. Two volumes of the &quot;History of Israel&quot;, his correspondence with his sister Henriette, his &quot;Letters to M. Berthelot&quot;, and the &quot;History of the Religious Policy of Philippe-le-Bel&quot;, which he wrote in the years immediately before his marriage, all appeared during the last eight years of the 19th century.

Renan died after a few days&#x27; illness in 1892 in Paris, and was buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre in the Montmartre Quarter.

==Reputation and controversies==
Hugely influential in his lifetime, Renan was eulogised after his death as the embodiment of the progressive spirit in western culture. Anatole France wrote that Renan was the incarnation of modernity. Renan&#x27;s works were read and appreciated by many of the leading literary figures of the time, including James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Matthew Arnold, Edith Wharton, and Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve. One of his greatest admirers was Manuel González Prada in Peru who took the &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; as a basis for his anticlericalism. In his 1932 document &quot;The Doctrine of Fascism&quot;, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini also applauded perceived &quot;prefascist intuitions&quot; in a section of Renan&#x27;s &quot;Meditations&quot; that argued against democracy and individual rights as &quot;chimerical&quot; and intrinsically opposed to &quot;nature&#x27;s plans&quot;.

===Statue===

In 1903 a major controversy accompanied the installation of a monument in Tréguier designed by Jean Boucher. Placed in the local cathedral square, it was interpreted as a challenge to Catholicism, and led to widespread protests, especially because the site was normally used for the temporary pulpit erected at the traditional Catholic festival of the Pardon of St Yves. It also included the Greek goddess Athena raising her arm to crown Renan gesturing in apparent challenge towards the cathedral. The local clergy organised a protest calvary sculpture designed by Yves Hernot as &quot;a symbol of the triumphant ultramontaine church.&quot;

===Views on race===
Renan believed that racial characteristics were instinctual and deterministic. Renan believed that the Semitic race was inferior to the Aryan race. Renan claimed that the Semitic mind was limited by dogmatism and lacked a cosmopolitan conception of civilisation. For Renan, Semites were &quot;an incomplete race.&quot; Some authors argue that Renan developed his antisemitism from Voltaire&#x27;s anti-Judaism.

He did not regard the Ashkenazi Jews of Europe as being a Semitic people. Renan is acknowledged for launching the so-called Khazar theory. This theory states that Ashkenazim had their origin in Turkic refugees that had converted to Judaism and later migrated from the collapsed Khazar Khanate westward into the Rhineland, and exchanged their native Khazar language for the Yiddish language while continuing to practice the Jewish religion. In his 1883 lecture &quot;Le Judaïsme comme race et comme religion&quot; he disputed the concept that Jewish people constitute a unified racial entity in a &quot;biological&quot; sense, which made his views unpalatable within racial antisemitism. Renan was also known for being a strong critic of German ethnic nationalism, with its antisemitic undertones. His notions of race and ethnicity were completely at odds with the European antisemitism of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Renan wrote the following about the long history of persecution of Jews:

When all nations and all ages have persecuted you, there must be some motive behind it all. The Jew, up to our own time, insinuated himself everywhere, claiming the protection of the common law; but, in reality, remaining outside the common law. He retained his own status; he wished to have the same guarantees as everyone else, and, over and above that, his own exceptions and special laws. He desired the advantages of the nations without being a nation, without helping to bear the burdens of the nations. No people has ever been able to tolerate this. The nations are military creations founded and maintained by the sword; they are the work of peasants and soldiers; towards establishing them the Jews have contributed nothing. Herein is the great fallacy inspired in Israelite pretensions. The tolerated alien can be useful to a country, but only on condition that the country does not allow itself to be invaded by him. It is not fair to claim family rights in a house which one has not built, like those birds which come and take up their quarters in a nest which does not belong to them, or like the crustaceans which steal the shell of another species.

However, during the 1880s, Renan shifted away from these views. In a lecture on &quot;Judaism as a Race and as a Religion&quot;, he stated:

When, in 1791, the National Assembly decreed the emancipation of the Jews, it concerned itself very little with race. It considered that men ought to be judged, not by the blood that runs in their veins, but by their moral and intellectual value. It is the glory of France to take these questions by their human side. The work of the nineteenth century is to tear down every ghetto, and I have no praise for those who seek to rebuild them. The Israelite race has in the past rendered the greatest services to the world. Blended with the different nations, in harmony with the diverse national unities of Europe, it will continue to do in the future what it has done in the past. By its collaboration with all the liberal forces of Europe, it will contribute eminently to the social progress of humanity.

In the aforementioned 1882 conference on &quot;What Is a Nation?&quot;, Renan had spoken out against the theories that were based on race: Both the principle of nations is right and legitimate, as that of the primordial right of races is wrong and full of dangers for true progress … The truth is that pure race does not exist and that to base politics on ethnographic analysis means to base it on a chimera.

And in 1883, in a lecture called &quot;The Original Identity and Gradual Separation of Judaism and Christianity&quot;:

Judaism, which has served so well in the past, will still serve in the future. It will serve the true cause of liberalism, of the modern spirit. Every Jew is a liberal ... The enemies of Judaism, however, if you only look at them more closely, you will see that they are the enemies of the modern spirit in general.

Other comments on race, have also proven controversial, especially his belief that political policy should take into account supposed racial differences:

Nature has made a race of workers, the Chinese race, who have wonderful manual dexterity and almost no sense of honor... A race of tillers of the soil, the Negro; treat him with kindness and humanity, and all will be as it should; a race of masters and soldiers, the European race. Reduce this noble race to working in the ergastulum like Negroes and Chinese, and they rebel... But the life at which our workers rebel would make a Chinese or a fellah happy, as they are not military creatures in the least. Let each one do what he is made for, and all will be well.

This passage, among others, was cited by Aimé Césaire in his &quot;Discourse on Colonialism&quot;, as evidence of the alleged hypocrisy of Western humanism and its &quot;sordidly racist&quot; conception of the rights of man.

===Republican racism===
During the arising of racism theories around Europe and specifically in French Third Republic, Renan had an important influence on the matter. He was a defender of people&#x27;s self-determination concept, but on the other hand was in fact convinced of a &quot;racial hierarchy of peoples&quot; that he said was &quot;established&quot;. Discursively, he subordinated the principle of self-determination of peoples to a racial hierarchy, i.e. he supported the colonialist expansion and the racist view of the Third Republic because he believed the French to be hierarchically superior (in a racial matter) to the African nations. This subtle racism, called by Gilles Manceron &quot;Republican racism&quot;, was common in France during the Third Republic and was also a well-known defensing discourse in politics. Supporters of colonialism used the concept of cultural superiority, and described themselves as &quot;protectors of civilization&quot; to justify their colonial actions and territorial expansion. There was also another motivation for his support of colonialism, Renan wrote that &quot;a nation which does not colonize is irrevocably doomed to socialism, to the war between rich and poor&quot;.

<text>The Genealogical Office is an office of the Government of Ireland containing genealogical records. It includes the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland (), the authority in Ireland for heraldry. The Chief Herald authorises the granting of arms to Irish bodies and Irish people, including descendants of emigrants. The office was constituted on 1 April 1943 as successor to the Ulster King of Arms, established during the Tudor period of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1552. The Ulster King of Arms&#x27; duties in relation to Northern Ireland were taken over by the Norroy and Ulster King of Arms.

The Genealogical Office was based in Dublin Castle until 1981. It was made part of the Department of Education in 1943. In 1987 it relocated to Kildare Street, occupying part of the former Kildare Street Club premises beside the National Library of Ireland (NLI). It was formally recognised as part of the NLI in 1997. In 2002, it was transferred from Education to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. 
The State Heraldic Museum was housed in the Genealogical Office until its closure in 2007.

As of 2025, a notice on the website of the Office of the Chief Herald states that the office is &quot;currently not accepting any new applications for grants or confirmations of arms [..or..] in a position to answer general queries about heraldry&quot;.

==Jurisdiction==
The tradition of the Irish abroad seeking grants of arms from the Chief Herald continues to the present. The office accepts petitions for grants of arms from the following:

*A citizen of Ireland or a person who has an entitlement to become a citizen.
*A person resident in the state for at least the five-year period immediately before the date of the application.
*A public or local authority, corporate body or other entity which has been located or functioning in Ireland for at least five years.
*An individual, corporate body or other entity, not resident or located in Ireland but who or which has substantial historical, cultural, educational, financial or ancestral connections with Ireland.

An application for a grant of arms should be made to the Chief Herald, on a prescribed form, setting out, in the case of a personal application, basic personal information and accompanied by supporting certificates or other appropriate documents. For a grant of arms to a corporate body or other entity, the application should include information about the legal status (if any) of the organisation, its structure, its activities and business, the length of time during which it has operated and, if relevant, information about membership. Where appropriate, a certified copy of the resolution of the council, board, or other controlling body should be submitted. If an application appears to be in order the matter is considered in detail by a herald of arms who will consult with the applicant about possible designs. A preliminary painting is then made for the approval of the applicant who will also be shown a draft of the letters patent. The final document is issued on vellum and includes a hand-painted exemplification of the arms. The grant of arms is recorded in the Register of Arms and is a matter of public record.

In November 1945 the Chief Herald granted the coat of arms of Ireland to the state itself.

At the request of the Irish government grants of arms were made to US presidents John F. Kennedy in 1963 and Bill Clinton in 1995.

==Titles of nobility==
Article 40.2.1 of the Constitution of Ireland prohibits the conferral of a new title of nobility by the State, and Article 40.2.2 prohibits acceptance by any citizen of any title of nobility or of honour &quot;without the prior approval of the Government.&quot;

The Constitution does not prohibit the granting of honours, other than titles of nobility, by the State. The Constitution is also silent as to untitled nobility. The Government acknowledges titles of nobility that have in the past derived from the British Crown as the &quot;fount of honour&quot; then exercising sovereignty over Ireland, and in fact, such titles continue to be mentioned in confirmations of arms by the Chief Herald of Ireland.

==Chiefs of the Name==

When the Kingdom of Ireland was created in 1541, the Dublin administration wanted to involve the Gaelic chiefs in the new entity, creating new titles for them such as the Baron Upper Ossory, Earl of Tyrone, or the Barons Inchiquin. In the process, they were granted new coats of arms from 1552. The associated policy of surrender and regrant involved a change to succession to a title by primogeniture, and not by tanistry where a group of male cousins of a chief were eligible to succeed by election. This was accepted by the new title-holders, but not by some of their cousins. Thereafter the chiefs of the name succeeded by primogeniture for several centuries, in a similar way to the clan chiefs in Scotland.

Many other clan chiefs were never given formal titles or knighthoods from the Kingdom of Ireland, but were issued with arms and usually registered their genealogies with the heralds in Dublin, and became a significant part of the landed gentry.

After the Battle of Kinsale in 1601 and the subsequent Flight of the Earls, some dozens of the old Gaelic aristocracy scattered throughout Catholic Europe. Some of their descendants were granted courtesy recognition in 1943 by the Chief Herald as Chiefs of the Name, signifying that they were the senior male line descendant from the last recognised chief of the name.

The issue of the chiefs&#x27; succession arose again after the creation of the Chief Herald of Ireland in 1943. Some Chiefs of the Name favoured tanistry, while others saw primogeniture as a more practical system. In an address to the Irish Senate in December 2006, John O&#x27;Donoghue then Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, expressed the opinion that it was a matter for those who bore these titles to decide on the system they used for succession, but that he found it strange that an English system had been used for the succession of titles originally created under a native Irish system.

Following advice from the Attorney General that the recognition of Chiefs of the Name was without basis in law, the practice of courtesy recognition was abandoned in July 2003.

==Questions over legal status of the office==
Due reportedly to uncertainty concerning the legal validity of grants of arms in Ireland, the post of Chief Herald remained vacant from September 2003 until August 2005. It had been assumed that the prerogatives of the British Crown, including the power to grant arms, had been inherited after Irish independence in 1922.

While many functions had passed under the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 to the then Provisional Government of the Irish Free State in April 1922, the pre-existing office of the Ulster King of Arms continued unchanged until 1943.

In May 2005 the government commenced section 13 of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997. This enables the Board of the National Library to &quot;designate a member of its staff to perform the duty of researching, granting and confirming coats of arms and such member shall use the appellation Chief Herald of Ireland or, in the Irish language, Príomh-Aralt na hÉireann, while performing such duties&quot;. While this was intended to legitimise the granting of arms in Ireland, it initiated a debate as to whether any grants made since 1943 were valid. These would include the 1945 grant of the coat of arms of Ireland to the state itself.

The Genealogy and Heraldry Bill 2006 was introduced into Seanad Éireann to reform the Office and provide a firm legal basis for grants and confirmations of arms. This bill was withdrawn on 12 December 2006 with the consent of the sponsoring senator and was referred to the board of the National Library for consideration by John O&#x27;Donoghue, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.

In September 2007 a notice was added to the National Library website noting the suspension of grants of arms until the legal situation was clarified. Following the receipt of legal advice, the Board of the National Library was &quot;satisfied that it can exercise the heraldic powers conferred on it by the 1997 Act&quot;, and grants are again being made.

The Board did, however, note that &quot;doubts exist regarding the legal basis of heraldic functions exercised in the State prior to the establishment of the Board&quot; and that &quot;with minor amendment, the wording of the Act could be made more succinct&quot;.

While the issue of the legality of grants of arms by the Chief Herald has been resolved, no penalties or jurisdiction have yet been legislated for to discourage anyone from designing and using a new coat of arms. The specific emblazonments of self-designed arms may be protected by the current copyright law of Ireland.

==Chief Heralds==

* Edward McLysaght (1943–54)
* Gerard Slevin (1954–81)
* Donal Begley (1981–95)
* Patricia Donlon (1995–97)
* Brendan O Donoghue (1997–2003)
* Post vacant 2003–05
* Fergus Gillespie (2005–2009)
* Collette Byrne (2009–2010)
* Colette O&#x27;Flaherty (2010–)

==Costs of granting and preparing arms==
An applicant will be expected to provide genealogical information including birth, marriage and death certificates back to an ancestor that bore arms. Alternatively, an entirely new grant of arms can be discussed and designed. Since 7 October 2013 the basic cost of a Grant of Arms (or confirmation of a prior grant) has been:

* Individual €4,400
* Corporate bodies (Commercial) €17,250
* Local authorities, government offices and agencies €8,600
* Schools, clubs, professional associations and other non-profit organizations €8,600

The sum of €400 is payable when lodging the application; half of the remaining fee is payable when work on the design begins, and the balance must be paid before work on the actual grant of arms is put in hand by the Herald Painter.

<doc id="191827" wikidata="Q864686" url="?curid=191827" title="Bioregionalism">
<text>Bioregionalism is a philosophy that suggests that political, cultural, and economic systems are more sustainable and just if they are organized around naturally defined areas called &quot;bioregions&quot; (similar to &quot;ecoregions&quot;). Bioregions are defined through physical and environmental features, including watershed boundaries and soil and terrain characteristics. Bioregionalism stresses that the determination of a bioregion is also a cultural phenomenon, and emphasizes local populations, knowledge, and solutions.

Bioregionalism is a concept that goes beyond national boundaries—an example is the concept of Cascadia, a region that is sometimes considered to consist of most of Oregon and Washington, the Alaska Panhandle, the far north of California and the West Coast of Canada, sometimes also including some or all of Idaho and western Montana. Another example of a bioregion, which does not cross national boundaries, but does overlap state lines, is the Ozarks, a bioregion also referred to as the Ozarks Plateau, which consists of southern Missouri, northwest Arkansas, the northeast corner of Oklahoma, southeast corner of Kansas.

Bioregions are not synonymous with ecoregions as defined by organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund or the Commission for Environmental Cooperation; the latter are scientifically based and focused on wildlife and vegetation. Bioregions, by contrast, are human regions, informed by nature but with a social and political element. In this way bioregionalism is simply political localism with an ecological foundation.

== Overview ==
The term was coined by Allen Van Newkirk, founder of the Institute for Bioregional Research, in 1975, given currency by Peter Berg and Raymond F. Dasmann in the early 1970s, and has been advocated by writers such as David Haenke and Kirkpatrick Sale.

The bioregionalist perspective opposes a homogeneous economy and consumer culture with its lack of stewardship towards the environment. This perspective seeks to:
*Ensure that political boundaries match ecological boundaries.
*Highlight the unique ecology of the bioregion.
*Encourage consumption of local foods where possible.
*Encourage the use of local materials where possible.
*Encourage the cultivation of native plants of the region.
*Encourage sustainability in harmony with the bioregion.

== Bioregions ==

Bioregions are a foundational concept within the philosophical system called Bioregionalism. A bioregion is defined along watershed and hydrological boundaries, and uses a combination of bioregional layers, beginning with the oldest &quot;hard&quot; lines; geology, topography, tectonics, wind, fracture zones and continental divides, working its way through the &quot;soft&quot; lines: living systems such as soil, ecosystems, climate, marine life, and the flora and fauna, and lastly the &quot;human&quot; lines: human geography, energy, transportation, agriculture, food, music, language, history, indigenous cultures, and ways of living within the context set into a place, and it&#x27;s limits to determine the final edges and boundaries. 

Peter Berg and Judy Goldhaft who founded the Planet Drum foundation in 1973 and helped to popularize the concept of bioregions and bioregionalism, located in San Francisco and which just celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2023 defines a bioregion as the following::

== Bioregional mapping ==

This idea of bioregionalism is also rooted in an important concept called bioregional mapping, a powerful tool to increase understanding, change the story and influence policy. Bioregional Mapping is a participatory approach to cartography that focuses on mapping the natural, ecological and human realities of that have emerged in a place within a bioregion—an area defined by its natural boundaries, such as watersheds, ecosystems, and cultures that arise form a place, rather than human borders. This method highlights the interconnectedness of the region&#x27;s natural systems and human communities, offering a holistic view of the landscape that integrates ecological data with cultural and historical insights.

A good bioregional map shows layers of geology, flora, fauna, and inhabitation over time. This approach empowers individuals to contribute to the documentation of local knowledge, history, and cultural significance, thereby creating maps that are more inclusive and representative of the lived experiences within the bioregion. Community mapping includes the identification of traditional pathways, local species, historical landmarks, stories, songs, how things change over time, and other culturally significant sites that might not appear on standard maps.

Bioregional mapping also aligns with Indigenous mapping practices by recognizing the importance of natural boundaries and the relationship between people and their environment. The idea of bioregional mapping largely grew from the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation, Nisga&#x27;a, Tsilhqotʼin, Wetʼsuwetʼen first nations who used Bioregional Mapping to create some of the first bioregional atlases as part of court cases to defend their sovereignty in the 1980s and 1990s, one such example being the Tsilhqotʼin Nation v British Columbia. 

One of the best examples of a richly communicative bioregional map is David McClosky&#x27;s new map of Cascadia.

== Relationship to environmentalism ==
Bioregionalism, while akin to modern environmentalism in certain aspects, such as a desire to live in harmony with nature, differs in certain ways from the 20th century movement.

According to Peter Berg, bioregionalism is proactive, and is based on forming a harmony between human culture and the natural environment, rather than being protest-based like the original environmental movement. Also, modern environmentalists saw human industry in and of itself an enemy of environmental stability, viewing nature as a victim needing to be saved; bioregionalists see humanity and its culture as a part of nature, focusing on building a positive, sustainable relationship with both the sociological and ecological environments, rather than a focus on &quot;completely&quot; preserving and segregating the wilderness from the world of humanity. 

In this way the sentiments of Bioregionalism echo those of &quot;Classical&quot; Environmentalism, and early environmentalists such as Henry David Thoreau are sometimes viewed as predecessors of the Bioregionalist movement. 

== History ==
Bioregionalism emerged in the 1970s, developing primarily along the western coast of North America, and specifically from a broad coalition of poets, artists, writers, community leaders, and back-to-the-landers, and from the Digger movement which had grown in the late 1960s Beat Scene in San Francisco, and as a counter to the mainstream environmental movement, which many felt was reactionary and negative. They envisioned a positive, place-based alternative to mainstream efforts within a capitalist framework, or those of nation-states or other international bodies. This included many different individuals, including &quot;Peter Berg, Judy Goldhaft, Raymond Dasmann, Kirkpatrick Sale, Judith Plant, Eleanor Wright, Doug Aberley, Stephanie Mills, Jim Dodge, Freeman House, Van Andruss, David Haenke, and Gary Snyder&quot;, working together through the Planet Drum foundation, and similar groups to create a new place-based philosophy they called bioregionalism.

Bioregionalism also directly grew from a relationship with the civil rights and American Indian Movement, and efforts to reclaim their languages, territories and maps, and what bioregionalists saw as the global collapse of traditional ecological knowledge, language suppression and revitalization, and a hope that maps reframing names from &quot;North America&quot; to &quot;Turtle Island&quot; would help bioregions become frameworks for decolonization, as well as more accurate cultural representation and recognition of Indigenous sovereignty. It also grew from civil rights movement, anti-war movement, anti-nuclear movement, the Diggers, as well as an increasing awareness of pervasive ecological pollution, especially in areas like Los Angeles.

=== Allen Van Newkirk and the Institute for Bioregional Research ===
The term bioregion as it relates to bioregionalism is credited to Allen Van Newkirk, a Canadian poet and biogeographer. In this field, the idea of &quot;bioregion&quot; probably goes back much earlier than published material suggests, being floated in early published small press zines by Newkirk, and in conversational dialogue. He would go on to found the Institute for Bioregional Research and issued a series of short papers using the term bioregion as early as 1970, which would start to circulate the idea of &quot;bioregion&quot;. Newkirk met Peter Berg (another early scholar on Bioregionalism) in San Francisco in 1969 and again in Nova Scotia in 1971 where he shared the idea with Berg. Peter Berg, who would go on to found the Planet Drum foundation, and become a leading proponent of &quot;bioregions&quot; learned of the term in 1971 while Judy Goldhaft and Peter Berg were staying with Allen Van Newkirk, before Berg attended the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm during June 1972. Berg would go on to found the Planet Drum Foundation in 1973, and they published their first Bioregional Bundle in that year, that also included a definition of a bioregion. Helping refine this definition, Author Kirkpatrick Sale wrote in 1974 that &quot;A bioregion is a part of the earth&#x27;s surface whose rough boundaries are determined by natural rather than human dictates, distinguishable from other areas by attributes of flora, fauna, water, climate, soils and landforms, and human settlements and cultures those attributes give rise to. in 1975 A. Van Newkirk published the first article calling for bioregionalism in a paper entitled &quot;Bioregions: Towards Bioregional Strategy for Human Cultures&quot; in which he advocates for the incorporation of human activity (&quot;occupying populations of the culture-bearing animal&quot;) within bioregional definitions.

=== Judy Goldhaft, Peter Berg and the Planet Drum Foundation ===
Starting in 1973, Planet Drum Foundation in San Franscisco became a leading institution promoting bioregionalism. They published a series of publications looking at place, poetry, cultural expression, politics, art and many other subjects. From this group, other early bioregional groups started, such as the Frisco Bay Mussel Group, Raise the Stakes newsletters, and Bioregional Bundles that would carry the bioregional movement forward for the next several decades.

This started by creating bioregional “Bundles” that they would publish each year, that would be distinct to a bioregion, and help the people within that place define that bioregion. Each envelope would contain many different pieces of poetry, art, writing, science documents, and place-specific technology booklets, articles, maps, posters, photographs, directories, and calendars. From 1973 to 1985 Planet Drum published nine Bundles, on topics ranging as far as North America, South America, the Arctic Circle, West Africa, Morocco, the Pacific Rim, Japan, and China. From 1979-2000, Planet Drum began publishing &quot;Raise The Stakes&quot;, &quot;the Planet Drum Review&quot;, a bi-annual international publication which became an important central voice for the bioregional movement, bioregional organizers around North America and world, and for defining the term bioregion among those using it. By 1990, Planet Drum served as node for more than 250 bioregionally oriented groups in North America, including Canada and Mexico, with emerging movements in Australia, Latin America, Italy and Spain.

=== Raymond Dasmann and Reinhabiting California ===
One of the other early proponents of bioregionalism, and who helped define what a bioregion is, was American biologist and environmental scientist Raymond F. Dasmann. Dasmann studied at UC Berkeley under the legendary wildlife biologist Aldo Leopold, and earned his Ph.D. in zoology in 1954. Working with Peter Berg, and also contemporary with Allen Van Newkirk, Dasmann was one of the pioneers in developing the definition for the term &quot;Bioregion&quot;, as well as conservation concepts of &quot;Eco-development&quot; and &quot;biological diversity,&quot; and identified the crucial importance of recognizing indigenous peoples and their cultures in efforts to conserve natural landscapes. He began his academic career at Humboldt State University, where he was a professor of natural resources from 1954 until 1965. During the 1960s, he worked at the Conservation Foundation in Washington, D.C., as Director of International Programs and was also a consultant on the development of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. In the 1970s he worked with UNESCO where he initiated the Man and the Biosphere Programme(MAB), an international research and conservation program. During the same period he was Senior Ecologist for the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Switzerland, initiating global conservation programs which earned him the highest honors awarded by The Wildlife Society, and the Smithsonian Institution.

This idea was carried forward and developed by ecologist Raymond Dasmann and Peter Berg in article they co-authored called Reinhabiting California in 1977, which argued that bioregions were more than just biotic provinces and biogeography, and that humans are a critical part of the idea of bioregions. Peter Berg and ecologist Raymond Dasmann said in their 1977 article &quot;Reinhabiting California&quot;:&quot;Reinhabitation involves developing a bioregional identity, something most North Americans have lost or have never possessed. We define bioregion in a sense different from the biotic provinces of Raymond Dasmann (1973) or the biogeographical province of Miklos Udvardy. The term refers both to geographical terrain and a terrain of consciousness—to a place and the ideas that have developed about how to live in that place. Within a bioregion, the conditions that influence life are similar, and these, in turn, have influenced human occupancy.&quot;This article defined bioregions as distinct from biogeographical and biotic provinces that ecologists and geographers had been developing by adding a human and cultural lens to the strictly ecological idea.

=== Murray Bookchin and the Institute for Social Ecology ===
This new movement grew strongly also on earlier work from Murray Bookchin, who ran the Institute for Social Ecology, and was deeply involved in influencing and helping define the early bioregional movement. Drawing on earlier traditions beginning with Ecology and Revolutionary Thought in 1964 Bookchin argued for the reorganization of American society based upon a decentralized regional model which would each encompass a single bioregion or ecosystem. His organization, the Institute for Social Ecology worked with the Planet Drum Foundation for the increased implementation of alternative forms of energy, reduction and restriction of carbon dioxide emissions, anti-globalism, and the implementation of a bioregional approach to economic development. For Bookchin, a bioregional approach to economic development accepted one of the basic assertions of Social Ecology that a human community is fundamentally a part of a total ecosystem. Furthermore, Bookchin felt that humans were a part of an earth society:

Peter Berg, writing about his experience helping to write the &quot;Bioregions&quot; issue of Coevolution Quarterly in the late 70&#x27;s worked with Bookchin&#x27; to use his Ecology of Freedom, which Berg claimed to be an &quot;invaluable help to set the autonomous and self-governing tone of bioregional discourse.&quot;

=== Bioregional Congresses ===

A major evolution in how bioregions were defined also occurred alongside this work in the mid-1980s, and can be attributed to David Haenke (b. 1945), Inspired by the call of Peter Berg, who released &quot;Amble towards a Continental Congress&quot; in 1976 for the bicentennial of the United States founding, Haenke conceptualized the Ozark Area Community Congress in 1977, started the Bioregional Project in 1982, launched the Ozarks Bioregional Congress in 1980, and then launched the first ever North American Bioregional Congress (NABC) in 1984.

David Haenke would also go on to be one of the founders of the United States Green Party, which he viewed as a political wing of the bioregional movement.

David Haenke had two questions he asked while defining a bioregion:

From 1984 through the 2010s, many regional groups, such as the Great Lakes, Kansas, Cascadia, would hold regional &quot;Bioregional Congresses&quot; for specific bioregions, and then every two years would gather as part of a North American bioregional congress. Cascadia for example held its first Cascadia Bioregional Congress at The Evergreen State College in 1986, an Ish River confluence in 1987, another Bioregional Congress in 1988 at Breitenbush in Oregon, and a third congress in Lillooet in British Columbia in 1989. This was also timed for the third North American Bioregional Congress which took place in Samish in 1988.

=== Bioregional Learning Centers ===
The idea of bioregions, and their uses was again expanded by Donella Meadows, author of The Limits to Growth in 1972, and was the primary premise for her to launch the Balaton Group in 1982. A big part of this for her, was using bioregions as the basis for &quot;bioregional learning centers&quot;, each of which would be responsible for a discrete bioregion. In her words, the purpose of a bioregion was to:

== In politics ==
North American Bioregional Assemblies have been meeting at bi-annual gatherings of bioregionalists throughout North America since 1984 and have given rise to national level Green Parties. The tenets of bioregionalism are often used by green movements, which oppose political organizations whose boundaries conform to existing electoral districts. This problem is perceived to result in elected representatives voting in accordance with their constituents, some of whom may live outside a defined bioregion, and may run counter to the well-being of the bioregion.

At the local level, several bioregions have congresses that meet regularly. For instance, the Ozark Plateau bioregion hosts a yearly Ozark Area Community Congress, better known as OACC, which has been meeting every year since 1980, most often on the first weekend in October. The Kansas Area Watershed, &quot;KAW&quot; was founded in 1982 and has been meeting regularly since that time. KAW holds a yearly meeting, usually in the spring.

The government of the Canadian province of Alberta created the &quot;land-use framework regions&quot; in 2007 roughly corresponding to each major river basin within the province. This is supported by local initiatives such as the Beaver Hills Initiative to preserve an ecoregion which encompasses Elk Island National Park and the surrounding area.

<doc id="191829" wikidata="Q30970737" url="?curid=191829" title="Political Islam">
<text>Political Islam is the interpretation of Islam as a source of political identity and action. It advocates the formation of state and society according to (the advocates understanding of) Islamic principles, where Islam serves as a source of political positions and concepts. Political Islam is generally used interchangeably with the term &quot;Islamism&quot; by authors inside and outside of academia, and thought of as the political element of the Islamic revival that began in the 20th century,
rather than just any form of political activity by Muslims. However, there have also been new attempts to distinguish between Islamism as religiously based political movements and political Islam as a national modern understanding of Islam shared by secular and Islamist actors.

== Development of the term==

The terminology which is used for the phenomenon of political Islam differs among experts. Martin Kramer was one of the first experts to start using the term &quot;political Islam&quot; in 1980. In 2003, he stated that &quot;political Islam&quot; can also be seen as tautology because nowhere in the Muslim world is a religion separated from politics. Some experts use terms like &quot;Islamism&quot;, pointing out the same set of occurrences or they confuse both terms. Dekmejian was among the first of the experts who made remarks on politicisation of Islam in the context of the failure of secular Islamic governments while he uses both &quot;Islamism&quot; and &quot;fundamentalism&quot; at the same time (rather than &quot;political Islam&quot;).

The term &quot;political Islam&quot; has been used in connection with foreign communities, referring to the movements or groups which have invested in a broad fundamentalist revival that is connected to a certain political agenda. M. A. Muqtedar Khan incorporates into political Islam all the Islamic movements promoting a political system based solely on Islam which must be followed by every Muslim. Some of the experts also use other descriptive terms in order to distinguish various ideological courses within political Islam: &quot;conservative&quot;, &quot;progressive&quot;, &quot;militant&quot;, &quot;radical&quot;, &quot;jihadist&quot;, etc. Bill Warner, a retired professor of physics and critic of political Islam, defines political Islam as that part of the text of the primary Islamic doctrine (Koran, Sira, Hadith) that affect non-Muslims (Kafirs) and non-Muslim societies. He has been criticised for identifying Islam with Islamism and for his methodology. In 2011, the Southern Poverty Law Center included him in a list of ten anti-Islam hardliners in the United States.

== Definitions ==
Islamic scholar Gudrun Krämer, a professor at the Free University of Berlin, writes:&quot;Political Islam is not synonymous with violent, radical, or extremist Islamism, and it is not restricted to opposition groups. The spectrum ranges from advocates of an Islamic republic to sympathizers of an Islamic monarchy or a resuscitated caliphate, and from self-declared liberals to uncompromising conservatives. Some Islamists are commonly classified as moderate or pragmatic, others as radical, militant, or extremist.&quot;

John L. Esposito (Georgetown University) and Emad El-Din Shahin (American University in Cairo) give the following definition in &quot;The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics&quot;:&quot;In recent years, political Islam has manifested itself in two diametrically opposed orientations: an increasing involvement in the democratization process by mainstream movements after the success of pro-democracy popular uprisings in toppling autocratic regimes and a growing inclination toward violence by fringe groups. Political Islam here refers to the attempts of Muslim individuals, groups and movements to reconstruct the political, economic, social and cultural basis of their society along Islamic lines. This process involves different views of the place of Shari`ah in society and the approach to bringing about change. While majorities of Islamic movements have engaged in the democratization process in their respective countries, some have embraced violence and terrorism as an ideological and strategic choice, with devastating consequences for the world and for Islam itself.&quot;

Mouhanad Khorchide (University of Münster), as head of the scientific advisory board of the Documentation Center for Political Islam in Austria, stated in 2020 that the term &quot;Political Islam&quot; should be treated as a technical term and therefore written with a capital &#x27;P&#x27;. He devoloped the following definition that is also the working definition of the term by the Documentation Center for Political Islam in Austria:&quot;Ideology of supremacy that aims at influencing or changing society, culture, state, policy, politics and/or polity according to such values and norms that are declared as Islamic by the actors of Political Islam, but are not shared by the majority of Muslims and are in clear contradiction to the rule of law, democracy and human rights.&quot;

The Routledge Handbook of Political Islam provides the following definition by political scientist Shahram Akbarzadeh, a professor at the University of Melbourne:&quot;Political Islam is a modern phenomenon that seeks to use religion to shape the political system. Its origins lie in the perceived failure of the secular ideologies of nationalism and socialism to deliver on their promises of anti-imperialism and prosperity.&quot;

In another paper, Rüdiger Lohlker criticizes numerous assumptions surrounding the discussion on Political Islam:&quot;All the categories we are discussing are affected by this &quot;dubious&quot; assumption that there is a transhistorical essence of religion. &quot;The most dubious&quot; of all these categories may be Political Islam with its background assumption that &quot;true&quot; religion has to be privatised but ignoring that the privatised need for belief is based on a universalised dominance of Christian traditions in public discourse and institutions. Even if political Catholicism may also be regarded as dubious, the notion ignores the fundamental difference of a phenomenon that strives for political dominance (sometimes successful) in the hegemonic European context. Thus, putting majority aspirations and some strands of minority discourses and organisations at the same level is a major failure of analysis. Talking about Political Islam means that we are referring to the ongoing discussion. To rethink this category and others we should think about Islam as a practice, not a transhistorical spectre of religion called Islam that is haunting the Western imaginaire.&quot;The editors of the &quot;Handbook of Political Islam in Europe&quot; (2024), the Cologne-based political scientist Thomas Jäger and the director of the European Institute for Counterterrorism and Conflict Prevention (EICTP), Ralph Thiele, offer the following definition:&quot;Actors of Political Islam pursue the political goals that are derived from the idea that Islam, as they understand it, should play the central role in shaping political, legal, and cultural systems worldwide. While it is a broad and diverse movement with various interpretations, variations, and organizations, there are core characteristics associated with Political Islam in general. The first and most important is the inseparability of religion and politics.&quot;

==In Muslim countries==
Some factions in the Middle East have come to associate the idea of modernities with the intrusions of colonial imperialism. In some Muslim countries, especially Egypt and Pakistan, political counter-movements with religious ideological leanings took root. The reasons are multifaceted. The collapse of the Ottoman Empire was a seismic event that created many aftershocks. The region experienced turbulence for many years as Arab countries fell within the cultural and colonial sphere of European nations. Under increasing cultural pressures Muslims asserted their national identities and cultural heritage, and some factions emphasized religious dimensions. In Egypt the weakness of Muslims was blamed on poor adherence to scripture. According to Hassan al-Banna, European culture was materialistic, immoral and based on class selfishness and usury. Other contributing factors may have been opposition to modernizing influences, overall poor governance and low levels of education in the population.

==Research in Europe==
In July 2020, the Austrian government made up of the ÖVP and the Greens set up the Documentation Centre Political Islam, an organization to research &quot;religiously motivated political extremism&quot; related to political Islam and to monitor related networks and social media. It was financed by the Austrian Foundation and through the 2015 Fund Act.

In the wake of the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran, the Austrian organization produced a report on the efforts of the Islamic Republic to exert influence abroad in the cultural, religious and educational sectors in Europe through foundations and religious centres, including the Islamic Center in Hamburg and the Imam Ali Center in Vienna. In 2022, the organization also investigated the Islamic Association in Austria, an organization that runs a mosque in Vienna&#x27;s Jewish neighbourhood that is allegedly responsible for propagating antisemitism, anti-Israel hatred, and support for Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.

<text>Mark-Anthony Turnage (born 10 June 1960) is an English composer of contemporary classical music.

==Life and career==
Mark-Anthony Turnage was born in Corringham, Essex on 10 June 1960. Turnage was the eldest of three children. His parents were lovers of classical music and were enthusiastic Pentecostal Christians.

He began composing at age nine and at fourteen began studying at the junior section of the Royal College of Music.

His initial musical studies were with Oliver Knussen, John Lambert, and later with Gunther Schuller. He also has been strongly influenced by jazz, in particular by the work of Miles Davis, and has composed works featuring jazz performers, including John Scofield, Peter Erskine, John Patitucci, and Joe Lovano.

Turnage has composed numerous orchestral and chamber works, and three full-length operas. &quot;Greek&quot;, composed with the encouragement of Hans Werner Henze and first performed in 1988 at the Munich Biennale, is based on Steven Berkoff&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;. &quot;The Silver Tassie&quot;, first performed in 2000, is based on the play by Seán O&#x27;Casey. &quot;Anna Nicole&quot;, with a libretto by Richard Thomas and first performed in 2011, relates the rise and fall of &quot;Playboy&quot; model and media celebrity Anna Nicole Smith. His opera for family audiences, &quot;Coraline&quot;, is based on the dark fantasy novel by Neil Gaiman, and was staged by The Royal Opera at the Barbican Theatre in 2018. His operas have been performed around the world including notably by New York City Opera (2013), Opernhaus Zurich (2019), Theater Dortmund (2013), Theater Freiburg (2018) and the Opera de Lille (2018).

Other works include &quot;Three Screaming Popes&quot; (after the paintings by Francis Bacon), &quot;Your Rockaby&quot; (a concerto for saxophone and orchestra), &quot;Yet Another Set To&quot; (a concerto for trombone and orchestra, dedicated to Christian Lindberg), and &quot;From the Wreckage&quot; (a concerto for trumpet and orchestra, written for Håkan Hardenberger). &quot;Blood on the Floor&quot; (1993–1996), for jazz quartet and large ensemble, contains nine sections with a shared theme of drug addiction, the section titled &quot;Elegy for Andy&quot; being a lament for the loss of his brother in a drug-related death.

More recent Turnage scores have included the orchestral work &quot;Remembering&quot;, conducted by Simon Rattle in 2017 with the London Symphony Orchestra and Berlin Philharmonic; double violin concerto &quot;Shadow Walker&quot; for soloists Vadim Repin and Daniel Hope, performed by the Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra in 2018; and &quot;Testament&quot; (2018), his setting of Ukrainian texts for soprano and orchestra. He has composed song cycles for a number of celebrated singers including Sarah Connolly, Gerald Finley and Allan Clayton.

Turnage&#x27;s work &quot;Blood on the Floor&quot; was choreographed by Wayne McGregor for Paris Opera Ballet in 2011 and in the same year he composed the score for Undance, collaborating with McGregor and visual artist Mark Wallinger. In 2012 &quot;Trespass&quot;, a ballet choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon and Alistair Marriott with score by Turnage, was first performed by The Royal Ballet. In 2017 he composed the score for Strapless, choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon for The Royal Ballet. Other choreographers that have made ballets to Turnage&#x27;s works include Heinz Spoerli (Zurich Ballet 2007 and Staatsballet Berlin 2012), Ashley Page (Rambert Dance Company 2013), Jorma Elo (Hubbard Street Dance Chicago 2007) and Gregor Zollig (Tanztheater Bielefeld 2006).

Turnage was the first Radcliffe Composer in Association with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from 1989 until 1993 and between 2000 and 2003 was the BBC Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s first Associate Composer. He was Composer in Residence with the London Philharmonic Orchestra from 2005 until 2010. Between 2006 and 2010, Turnage was a co-composer-in-residence of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a position he held alongside Argentinian composer Osvaldo Golijov.

In autumn 2005 he was appointed the Royal College of Music&#x27;s Research Fellow in Composition. In 2015 he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to music.

== Personal life ==
His partner is the director Rachael Hewer, who founded the Virtual Opera Project (VOPERA) in 2020.

In January 2025 Turnage was the castaway for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, where his choices included &quot;Notre Dame des Jouets&quot; by Oliver Knussen, &quot;Blue in Green&quot; by Miles Davis and &quot;Living for the City&quot; by Stevie Wonder. In the same programme he spoke about volunteering regularly at a food bank, and about working on music projects with prisoners.

<doc id="191836" wikidata="Q18425" url="?curid=191836" title="Marcellin Berthelot">
<text>Pierre Eugène Marcellin Berthelot (; 25 October 1827 – 18 March 1907) was a French chemist and Republican politician noted for the ThomsenBerthelot principle of thermochemistry. He synthesized many organic compounds from inorganic substances, providing a large amount of counter-evidence to the theory of Jöns Jakob Berzelius that organic compounds required organisms in their synthesis.
Berthelot was convinced that chemical synthesis would revolutionize the food industry by the year 2000, and that synthesized foods would replace farms and pastures. &quot;Why not&quot;, he asked, &quot;if it proved cheaper and better to make the same materials than to grow them?&quot;

He was considered &quot;one of the most famous chemists in the world.&quot; Upon being appointed to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs for the French government in 1895, he was considered &quot;the most eminent living chemist&quot; in France. 
In 1901, he was elected as one of the &quot;Forty Immortals&quot; of the Académie française.
He gave all his discoveries not only to the French government but to humanity.

==Personal life==
Berthelot was born in Rue du Mouton, Paris, France, on 25 October 1827, the son of a doctor. He decided with his friend, the great historian Ernest Renan, not to attend a where the vast majority of intellectuals were being educated. After doing well at school in history and philosophy, he became a scientist.

He was an atheist but was very influenced by his wife, who was a Calvinist (his wife came from Louis Breguet&#x27;s family).

==Discoveries==

The fundamental conception that underlay all Berthelot&#x27;s chemical work was that all chemical phenomena depend on the action of physical forces which can be determined and measured. When he began his active career it was generally believed that, although some instances of the synthetic production of organic substances had been observed, on the whole organic chemistry remained an analytical science and could not become a constructive one, because the formation of the substances with which it deals required the intervention of vital activity in some shape. He engaged in a long argument with Louis Pasteur on the subject of vitalism, in which Pasteur took the vitalist position on the basis of his work on alcoholic fermentation.

To this attitude he offered uncompromising opposition, and by the synthetic production of numerous hydrocarbons, natural fats, sugars and other bodies he proved that organic compounds can be formed by ordinary methods of chemical manipulation and obey the same principles as inorganic substances, thus exhibiting the &quot;creative character in virtue of which chemistry actually realizes the abstract conceptions of its theories and classifications—a prerogative so far possessed neither by the natural nor by the historical sciences.&quot;

==Recognition==
In 1863 he became a member of the Académie Nationale de Médecine; he was also awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1880. In 1881 he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1833. In 1895, he was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society.

Avenue Berthelot in Lyon was named after him on 25 March 1907.

==Publications==

His investigations on the synthesis of organic compounds were published in numerous papers and books, including &quot;Chimie organique fondée sur la synthèse&quot; (1860) and &quot;Les Carbures d&#x27;hydrogène&quot; (1901). He stated that chemical phenomena are not governed by any peculiar laws special to themselves, but are explicable in terms of the general laws of mechanics that are in operation throughout the universe; and this view he developed, with the aid of thousands of experiments, in his &quot;Mécanique chimique&quot; (1878) and his &quot;Thermochimie&quot; (1897). This branch of study naturally conducted him to the investigation of explosives, and on the theoretical side led to the results published in his work &quot;Sur la force de la poudre et des matières explosives&quot; (1872), while in practical terms it enabled him to render important services to his country as president of the scientific defence committee during the siege of Paris (1870–1871) and subsequently as chief of the French explosives committee. He performed experiments to determine gas pressures during hydrogen explosions using a special chamber fitted with a piston, and was able to distinguish burning of mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen from true explosions.

===Historical and philosophical work===
During later life he researched and wrote books on the early history of chemistry such as &quot;Les Origines de l&#x27;alchimie&quot; (1885) and &quot;Introduction à l&#x27;étude de la chimie des anciens et du moyen âge&quot; (1889), He also translated various old Greek, Syriac and Arabic treatises on alchemy and chemistry: &quot;Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs&quot; (1887–1888) and &quot;La Chimie au moyen âge&quot; (1893). He was the author of &quot;Science et philosophie&quot; (1886), which contains a well-known letter to Renan on &quot;&quot;La Science idéale et la science positive&quot;,&quot; of &quot;La Révolution chimique, Lavoisier&quot; (1890), of &quot;Science et morale&quot; (1897), and of numerous articles in &quot;La Grande Encyclopédie&quot;, which he helped to establish.

==Family==

Berthelot died suddenly on 18 March 1907, immediately after the death of his wife Sophie Niaudet (1837–1907), in Paris. His professorship was filled by Emil Jungfleisch.

He was buried with his wife in the Panthéon. He had six children: Marcel André (1862–1939), Marie-Hélène (1863–1895), Camille (1864–1928), Daniel (1865–1927), Philippe (1866–1934), and René (1872–1960).

<text>Antoine Jérôme Balard (; 30 September 1802 – 30 April 1876) was a French chemist and one of the discoverers of bromine.

==Career==
Born at Montpellier, France, on 30 September 1802, he started as an apothecary, but taking up teaching he acted as chemical assistant at the faculty of sciences of his native town, and then became professor of chemistry at the royal college and school of pharmacy and at the faculty of sciences. In 1826 he discovered in seawater a substance which he recognized as a previously unknown element and named it bromine. It had been independently prepared by Carl Jacob Löwig the previous year and the two are both regarded as having discovered the element.

This achievement brought him the reputation that secured his election as successor to Louis Jacques Thénard in the chair of chemistry at the faculty of sciences in Paris, and in 1851 he was appointed professor of chemistry at the College de France, where he had Marcellin Berthelot first as pupil, then as assistant and finally as colleague. Balard also had Louis Pasteur as a pupil when Pasteur was only 26 years old. It was in Balard&#x27;s laboratory that Pasteur discovered the difference between &quot;right-handed&quot; and &quot;left-handed&quot; crystals while he was working with tartaric acid. Balard died in Paris on 30 April 1876.

While the discovery of bromine and the preparation of many of its compounds was his most conspicuous piece of work, Balard was an industrious chemist on both the pure and applied sides. In his researches on the bleaching compounds of chlorine he was the first to advance the view that bleaching-powder is a double compound of calcium chloride and hypochlorite; and he devoted much time to the problem of economically obtaining soda and potash from seawater, though here his efforts were nullified by the discovery of the much richer sources of supply afforded by the Stassfurt deposits. In organic chemistry he published papers on the decomposition of ammonium oxalate, with formation of oxamic acid, on amyl alcohol, on the cyanides, and on the difference in constitution between ethyl nitrate and ethyl sulfate. He also helped Louis Pasteur devise the experiment that would prove spontaneous generation to be false.

==Botany and John Stuart Mill==
Antoine Jérôme Balard met John Stuart Mill while Mill was studying at the Montpellier Faculty of Sciences in the Winter of 1820. 
In Mill&#x27;s journal of the period he writes of visiting Balard at his home, being shown his herbarium and receiving from him a selection of his plants from the Montpellier area, in addition to other accounts of the two embarking on daytrips around the city of Montpellier and to the sea to look for coastal plants. In a later letter to Auguste Comte, Mill describes Balard as his first real friend. A ‘friend of my own choice as opposed to those given to me by family ties’. 
A portion of John Stuart Mill&#x27;s Herbarium, believed to be in the vicinity of 4000 specimens, is housed at the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL) and within the Mill Herbarium are contained these Balard collections, mainly from the area of Montpellier.

==Commemoration==
Balard is commemorated in the name of Balard station on the Paris Metro.

<text>The Handheld Device Markup Language (HDML) is a markup language intended for display on handheld computers, information appliances, smartphones, etc.. It is similar to HTML, but for wireless and handheld devices with small displays, like PDA, mobile phones and so on. 

It was originally developed in about 1996 by Unwired Planet, the company that became Phone.com and then Openwave. HDML was submitted to W3C for standardization, but was not turned into a standard. Instead it became an important influence on the development and standardization of WML, which then replaced HDML in practice. Unlike WML, HDML has no support for scripts.

<text>The Hare Krishna mantra, also referred to reverentially as the  (), is a 16-word Vaishnava mantra mentioned in the Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upaniṣad. In the 15th century, it rose to importance in the Bhakti movement following the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. This mantra is composed of three Sanskrit names – &quot;Krishna&quot;, &quot;Rama&quot;, and &quot;Hare&quot;.

Since the 1960s, the mantra has been widely known outside India through A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and his movement, International Society for Krishna Consciousness (commonly known as the Hare Krishnas or the Hare Krishna movement).

==Mantra==
The Hare Krishna mantra is composed of three Sanskrit names: &quot;Hare&quot;, &quot;Krishna&quot;, and &quot;Rama&quot;. It is a poetic stanza in meter (a quatrain of four lines () of eight syllables with certain syllable lengths for some of the syllables).

The mantra as rendered in the oldest extant written source, the Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upaniṣad, is as follows:

When followers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu teach and practice the Mahamantra, it is rendered with the name Krishna first.

Pronunciation of mantra in IPA (Sanskrit):
This mantra has multiple interpretations. &quot;Hare&quot; can be interpreted as the vocative form of &quot;Hari&quot;, another name of Vishnu meaning &quot;he who removes illusion&quot;. Another interpretation is as the vocative of , a name of Radha, Krishna&#x27;s eternal consort or his energy (). According to A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, refers to &quot;the energy/shakti of Supreme Personality of Godhead&quot; while &quot;Krishna&quot; and &quot;Rama&quot; refer to Supreme Godhead himself, meaning &quot;He who is All-Attractive&quot; and &quot;He who is the Source of All Pleasure&quot;. In the hymn chanted by Bhishma in praise of Krishna after the Kurukshetra War, Krishna is also called &quot;Rama&quot;.

It is sometimes believed that &quot;Rama&quot; in &quot;Hare Rama&quot; means &quot;Radharamana&quot; or the beloved of Radha (another name for Krishna). The more common interpretation is that Rāma refers to Rama of the Ramayana, an earlier avatar of Krishna. &quot;Rama can also be a shortened form of Balarama, Krishna&#x27;s first expansion.&quot; The mantra is repeated, either sung out loud (bhajan), congregationally (kirtan), or to oneself aloud or mentally on prayer beads made of tulasi (japa). A. C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada describes the process of chanting the Mahamantra as follows:

==History==
The mantra is first attested in the (Kali Santarana Upanishads), an Upanishad, which is commented on by Raghunandan Bhattacharya in his work . In this Upanishad, Narada is instructed by Brahma (in the translation of K. N. Aiyar):

Narada asks to be told this name of Narayana, and Brahma replies:

Some versions of the Kali Santarana Upanishad give the mantra with &quot;Hare Rama&quot; preceding &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; (as quoted above), and others with &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; preceding &quot;Hare Rama&quot;, as in Navadvipa version of the manuscript. The latter format is by far the more common within the Vaishnava traditions. It is a common belief that the mantra is equally potent when spoken in either order.

Tradition believe that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu received this mantra at his initiation (&quot;diksha&quot;). Emic tradition claims that the mantra was popularized by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu roughly around 1500 A.D. when he began his mission to spread Harinam publicly to &quot;every town and village&quot; in the world, traveling throughout India, and especially within the areas of Bengal and Odisha. A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada brought the teachings of Chaitanya from India and spread them around the Western world. Beginning in New York City 1965, he encircled the globe fourteen times in the final eleven years of his life, thus making &#x27;Hare Krishna&#x27; a well-known phrase in many parts of the world.

==Scriptural references==
The practice of chanting the Hare Krishna mantra is recommended in the Puranas, the Pancharatra, and throughout Vaishnava literature in general. For example:

==Popular culture==
The Hare Krishna mantra appears in a number of famous songs, notably those of George Harrison. His first solo single &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; topped charts around the world in 1970–71. Harrison put a Hare Krishna sticker on the back of the headstock of Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1964 Gibson ES-335; the sticker also appears on Gibson&#x27;s 2005 reproduction of the guitar.

Produced by Harrison, Radha Krishna Temple&#x27;s recording &quot;Hare Krishna Mantra&quot; was issued as a single on the Beatles&#x27; Apple record label in 1969. The single was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 in the UK, and led to the Temple devotees appearing on the popular British music chart television programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

The Broadway musical &quot;Hair&quot; has a song, &quot;Hare Krishna&quot;, containing the mantra, along with some additional lyrics.

The mantra also prominently appears in Jesus Loves You&#x27;s &quot;Bow Down Mister&quot; (1990) and in the Pretenders&#x27; &quot;Boots of Chinese Plastic&quot; from their 2008 album, &quot;Break Up the Concrete&quot;. Stevie Wonder used the devotees chanting Hare Krishna in his song &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot;.

Less well-known recordings of the Hare Krishna mantra include versions by the Fugs on their 1968 album Tenderness Junction (featuring poet Allen Ginsberg), by Nina Hagen, in multiple songs by English psychedelic rock band Quintessence (produced by John Barham, a frequent collaborator of George Harrison) and by Hüsker Dü on their 1984 album &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;. Kula Shaker, Boy George, and members of the Rubettes have recorded music tracks about Krishna Consciousness.

In a 2010 experimental study involving both devotees and non-devotees, singing vowels like &quot;ah&quot; and &quot;eh&quot; was found to be more joyful than singing vowels like &quot;oh&quot; and &quot;uh&quot;, possibly due to a facial feedback effect.

<text>Michel Eugène Chevreul (; 31 August 1786 – 9 April 1889) was a French chemist whose work contributed to significant developments in science, medicine, and art. Chevreul&#x27;s early work with animal fats revolutionized soap and candle manufacturing and led to his isolation of the heptadecanoic (margaric), stearic, and oleic fatty acids. In the process, Chevreul became the first scientist to define the concept of a chemical compound and the first to formally characterize the nature of organic compounds; he is consequently considered a founder of modern organic chemistry.

In the medical field, Chevreul was first to demonstrate that diabetics excrete glucose in the urine and to isolate creatine. Chevreul&#x27;s study of textile dyes while director of the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris led to color theories that &quot;provided the scientific basis for Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painting.&quot;

Chevreul is one of the 72 French scientists, mathematicians, and engineers whose names are inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. He lived to be 102 and was a pioneer in the field of gerontology.

==Biography==

Chevreul was born in the town of Angers, France, where his father was a physician. Chevreul&#x27;s birth certificate, kept in the registry book of Angers, bears the signature of his father, grandfather, and a great-uncle, all of whom were surgeons.

At around the age of seventeen, Chevreul went to Paris and entered L. N. Vauquelin&#x27;s chemical laboratory, afterwards becoming his assistant at the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle (National Museum of Natural History) in the &quot;Jardin des Plantes&quot;.

In 1813, Chevreul was appointed professor of chemistry at the Lycée Charlemagne, and subsequently undertook the directorship of the Gobelins tapestry works, where he carried out his research on colour contrasts. (In 1839, he published the results of his research under the title &quot;De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs;&quot; It was translated into English and published in 1854 under the title &quot;The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors.&quot; A new translation titled &quot;On the Law of Simultaneous Contrast of Colors&quot;, with commentary, additional chapters, and colour graphics by Dan Margulis, appeared in 2020.) In 1826, Chevreul became a member of the Academy of Sciences, and in the same year was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society of London, whose Copley Medal he was awarded in 1857. In 1829, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1868.

Chevreul succeeded his master, Vauquelin, as professor of organic chemistry at the National Museum of Natural History in 1830, and thirty-three years later assumed its directorship also; this he relinquished in 1879, though he still retained his professorship. A bronze medal was minted for the occasion of Chevreul&#x27;s 100th birthday in 1886, and it was celebrated as a national event. Chevreul received letters of commendation from many heads of state and monarchs, including Queen Victoria. He had a series of recorded meetings with Nadar, whose son Paul Nadar took photographs, resulting in the first photo-interview ever to appear in a magazine.

Chevreul began to study the effects of aging on the human body shortly before his death at the age of 102, which occurred in Paris on 9 April 1889. He was honoured with a public funeral. In 1901, a statue was erected to his memory in the museum with which he was connected for so many years.

==Chevreul&#x27;s work==

Chevreul&#x27;s scientific work covered a wide range, but he is best known for the classical researches he carried out on animal fats, published in 1823 (&quot;Recherches sur les corps gras d&#x27;origine animale&quot;). These enabled him to elucidate the true nature of soap; he was also able to discover the composition of stearin, a white substance found in the solid parts of most animal and vegetable fats, and olein, the liquid part of any fat, and to isolate stearic and oleic acids, the names of which he invented. This work led to important improvements in the processes of candle-manufacture.

Chevreul was a determined enemy of charlatanism in every form, and a complete sceptic as to the &quot;scientific&quot; psychical research or spiritualism which had begun in his time. His research on the &quot;magic pendulum&quot;, Dowsing rods and table-turning is revolutionary. In an open letter to André-Marie Ampère in 1833, and his 1854 paper &quot;De la baguette&quot;, Chevreul explains how human muscular reactions, totally involuntary and subconscious, are responsible for seemingly magical movements. In the end, Chevreul discovered that once a person holding divining rods/magic pendulum became aware of the brain&#x27;s reaction, the movements stopped and could not be willingly reproduced. His was one of the earliest explanations of the ideomotor effect.

In 1824, Chevreul was named director of the dye works at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris, in response to complaints about technical inadequacies. He found that some dyes were indeed deficient, but that the oft-criticized black dye was first-rate. Yet fabrics dyed with this black were perceived as weak and reddish when surrounded by deep blues and/or purples. Chevreul called this effect simultaneous contrast, defining it as the tendency for a color to appear to shift toward the complementary of its neighbor, both in terms of hue and darkness.

He explored the ramifications of the concept at book-length in 1839, intending to form a comprehensive theory for all the visual arts. It offered design principles for tapestries, carpets, furniture, mosaics, churches, museums, apartments, formal gardens, theaters, maps, typography, framing, stained glass, women&#x27;s clothing, and even military uniforms. It is most noted, however, for its influence on Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painting, particularly the Pointillist style developed by Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, which featured tiny juxtapositions of complementary colors. Camille Pissarro reported that he had interviewed Seurat, who had described the style as a search for &quot;the modern synthesis with scientifically based means which will be founded on the theory of colors discovered by M. Chevreul and in accordance with the experiments of Maxwell and the measurements of N. O. Rood.&quot;

Chevreul stressed the importance of accurate portrayal of lighting in promoting realism, but added, &quot;It is almost always so that accurate, yet exaggerated coloring is found more pleasing than absolute fidelity to the scene.&quot; Vincent van Gogh took the advice to heart, making lavish use of complementaries to intensify one another. Van Gogh wrote, &quot;this reciprocal heightening is what&#x27;s called the law of simultaneous contrast…If the complementary colors are taken at equal value, that is to say, at the same degree of brightness and light, their juxtaposition will raise both the one and the other to an intensity so violent that human eyes will scarcely be able to bear to look at it.&quot;

Chevreul was also influential in twentieth-century painting, especially that of Robert Delaunay, who was introduced to Chevreul&#x27;s theories by his friend Jean Metzinger. Delaunay&#x27;s style of mixing relatively large blocks of near-complementaries is today usually known as Orphism. Delaunay himself, however, preferred the name &quot;Simultanism,&quot; a clear nod to Chevreul.

Chevreul is also linked to what is sometimes called &quot;Chevreul&#x27;s illusion&quot;, the bright edges that seem to exist between adjacent strips of identical colors having different intensities. See Chevreul&#x27;s &quot;The Laws of Contrast of Colour&quot; for more information.

<text>Louis Nicolas Vauquelin FRS(For) HFRSE (; 16 May 1763 – 14 November 1829) was a French pharmacist and chemist. He was the discoverer of chromium and beryllium.

==Early life==
Vauquelin was born at Saint-André-d&#x27;Hébertot in Normandy, France, the son of Nicolas Vauquelin, an estate manager, and his wife, Catherine Le Charterier.

His first acquaintance with chemistry was gained as laboratory assistant to an apothecary in Rouen (1777–1779), and after various vicissitudes he obtained an introduction to A. F. Fourcroy, in whose laboratory he was an assistant from 1783 to 1791.

Moving to Paris, he became a laboratory assistant at the Jardin du Roi and was befriended by a professor of chemistry. In 1791 he was made a member of the Academy of Sciences and from that time he helped to edit the journal &quot;Annales de Chimie&quot; &quot;(Chemical annals)&quot;, although he left the country for a while during the height of the French Revolution. In 1798 Vauquelin discovered beryllium oxide by extracting it from an emerald (a beryl variety); Klaproth isolated the element from the oxide.

==Contributions to chemistry==
At first his work appeared as that of his master and patron Fourcroy, then in their joint names; in 1790 he began to publish on his own, and between that year and 1833 his name is associated with 376 papers. Most of these were simple records of patient and laborious analytical operations, and it is perhaps surprising that among all the substances he analysed he detected only two new elements, beryllium in 1798 in beryl and chromium in 1797 in a red lead ore from Siberia. He also managed to get liquid ammonia at atmospheric pressure.
Later with Fourcroy, he identified a metal in a platinum residue they called &quot;ptène&quot;, This name &quot;ptene&quot; or &quot;ptène&quot; was reported as an early synonym for osmium.

Either together or successively he held the offices of inspector of mines, professor at the School of Mines and at the Polytechnic School, assayer of gold and silver articles, professor of chemistry in the College de France and at the Jardin des Plantes, member of the Council of Industry and Commerce, commissioner on the pharmacy laws, and finally professor of chemistry to the Medical Faculty, to which he succeeded on Fourcroy&#x27;s death in 1809. His lectures, which were supplemented with practical laboratory teaching, were attended by many chemists who subsequently attained distinction.

A lesser-known contribution and finding of his included the study of hens fed a known amount of mineral. &quot;Having calculated all the lime in oats fed to a hen, found still more in the shells of its eggs. Therefore, there is a creation of matter. In what way, no one knows.&quot;

==Final achievements, days and legacy==
From 1809 he was professor at the University of Paris. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1811 and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1816. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1828. In 1806, working with asparagus, he and Pierre Jean Robiquet (future discoverer of the famous red dye alizarin, then a young chemist and his assistant) isolated the amino acid asparagine, the first one to be discovered. He also discovered pectin and malic acid in apples, and isolated camphoric acid and quinic acid.

His death occurred while he was on a visit to his birthplace.

Among his best known works is &quot;Manuel de l&#x27;essayeur&quot; (Manual of the assayer).

The plant genus &quot;Vauquelinia&quot; is named in his honour, as is the Vauquelin, a white of egg foam associated with molecular gastronomy, and the mineral vauquelinite, discovered at the same mine as the crocoite from which Vauquelin isolated chromium.

<doc id="191856" wikidata="Q525545" url="?curid=191856" title="Chinese Rites controversy">
<text>The Chinese Rites controversy () was a dispute among Catholic missionaries over the religiosity of Confucianism and Chinese rituals during the 17th and 18th centuries. The debate discussed whether Chinese ritual practices of ancestor veneration and other formal rites qualified as religious, and thus incompatible with Catholic belief. The Jesuits argued that these Chinese rites were secular rituals that were compatible with Christianity, within certain limits, and should thus be tolerated. The Dominicans and Franciscans disagreed and reported the issue to Rome.

Rome&#x27;s Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith sided with the Dominicans in 1645 by condemning the Chinese rites based on their brief. The same congregation sided with the Jesuits in 1656, thereby lifting the ban. It was one of the many disputes between the Jesuits and the Dominicans in China and elsewhere in Asia, including Japan and India. The conflict between the Jesuits and their opponents took on a historical dimension, with the former insisting that Europeans and the Chinese had a shared history, which was taken to legitimise the Jesuit &quot;accommodation&quot; of Chinese rites and names for the Christian God.

The controversy embroiled many European universities; the Kangxi Emperor and several popes, including Clement XI and Clement XIV, considered the case; the offices of the Holy See also intervened. Near the end of the 17th century, many Dominicans and Franciscans had shifted their positions in agreeing with the Jesuits&#x27; opinion, but Rome disagreed. Clement XI banned the rites in 1704. In 1742, Benedict XIV reaffirmed the ban and forbade debate.

In 1939, after two centuries, the Holy See re-assessed the issue. Pius XII issued a decree on 8 December 1939, authorizing Chinese Catholics to observe the ancestral rites and participate in Confucius-honoring ceremonies. The general principle of sometimes admitting native traditions even into the liturgy of the church, provided that such traditions harmonize with the true and authentic spirit of the liturgy, was proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65).

==Background==
===Early adaptation to local customs===

Unlike the American landmass, which had been conquered by military force by Spain and Portugal, European missionaries encountered in Asia united, literate societies that were as yet untouched by European influence or national endeavor.

Alessandro Valignano, Visitor of the Society of Jesus in Asia, was one of the first Jesuits to argue, in the case of Japan, for an adaptation of Christian customs to the societies of Asia, through his &quot;Résolutions&quot; and &quot;Cérémonial&quot;.

===Matteo Ricci&#x27;s policy of accommodation===
In China, Matteo Ricci reused the &quot;Cérémonial&quot; and adapted it to the Chinese context. At one point the Jesuits even started to wear the gown of Buddhist monks, before adopting the more prestigious silk gown of Chinese literati. In particular, Matteo Ricci&#x27;s Christian views on Confucianism and Chinese rituals, often called the &quot;&quot; (), were followed by Jesuit missionaries in China and Korea.

In a decree signed on 23 March 1656, Pope Alexander VII accepted practices &quot;favorable to Chinese customs&quot;, reinforcing 1615 decrees which accepted the usage of the Chinese language in liturgy, a notable exception to the contemporary Latin Catholic discipline which had generally forbidden the use of local languages.

In the 1659 instructions given by the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (known as the &quot;Propaganda Fidei&quot;) to new missionaries to Asia, provisions were clearly made to the effect that adapting to local customs and respecting the habits of the countries to be evangelized was paramount:

===Reception in China===

The Jesuit order was successful in penetrating China and serving at the Imperial court. They impressed the Chinese with their knowledge of European astronomy and mechanics, and in fact ran the Imperial Observatory. The Kangxi Emperor was at first friendly to the Jesuit Missionaries working in China. Their accurate methods allowed him to successfully predict eclipses, one of his ritual duties. He was grateful for the services they provided to him, in the areas of astronomy, diplomacy and artillery manufacture. Jesuit translators Jean-François Gerbillon and Thomas Pereira took part in the negotiations of the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689, where they assisted with translation. The Jesuits made an important contribution to the Empire&#x27;s military, with the diffusion of European artillery technology, and they directed the castings of cannons of various calibers. The Kangxi Emperor also retained several Jesuits in his court as scientists and artists. By the end of the seventeenth century, the Jesuits had made many converts. They in turn were impressed by the knowledge and intelligence of the Han Chinese Confucian scholar elite, and adapted to their ancient Chinese intellectual lifestyle.

In 1692, Kangxi issued an edict of toleration of Christianity ( or ).

This edict enabled Christianity to be perceived by the state with &quot;positive neutrality&quot; and acceptable in the eyes of Confucian orthodoxy.

==Controversy==
The Jesuits gradually developed and adopted a policy of accommodation on the issue of Chinese rites. The Chinese scholar elite were attached to Confucianism, and while Buddhism and Daoism were in decline and losing patronage, Confucianism was arguably at its golden age during this period of Chinese history; even the rich urban class of merchants pursued it. Despite this, all three provided the framework of both state and home life. Both Confucian and Taoist practices involved veneration of one&#x27;s ancestors.

Besides the Jesuits, other religious orders such as the Dominicans, Franciscans, and Augustinians started missionary work in China during the 17th century, often coming from the Spanish colony of the Philippines.
Contrary to the Jesuits, they refused any adaptation to local customs and wished to apply in China the same &quot;tabula rasa&quot; principle they had applied in other places, and were horrified by the practices of the Jesuits.

They ignited a heated controversy and brought it to Rome. They raised three main points of contention:
* Determination of the Chinese word for &quot;God&quot;, which was generally accepted as 天主 &quot;Tiānzhǔ&quot; (Lord of Heaven), while Jesuits were willing to allow Chinese Christians to use 天 &quot;Tiān&quot; (Heaven) or 上帝 &quot;Shàngdì&quot; (Lord Above / Supreme Emperor)
* Prohibition of Christians from participating in the seasonal rites for Confucius.
* Prohibition of Christians from using of tablets with the forbidden inscription &quot;site of the soul&quot;, and from following the Chinese rites for the ancestor worship.

In Rome, the Jesuits tried to argue that these &quot;Chinese Rites&quot; were civic rituals, rather than religious, and that converts should be allowed to continue to participate. They maintained that Chinese folk religion and offerings to the Emperor and departed ancestors were civil in nature and therefore not incompatible with Catholicism, while their opponents argued that these kinds of worship were an expression of native religion and thus incompatible with Catholic beliefs.

==Pope Clement XI&#x27;s decree==

Pope Clement XI condemned the Chinese rites and Confucian rituals, and outlawed any further discussion in 1704, with the anti-rites decree of 20 November 1704.
It forbade the use of &quot;Tian&quot; and &quot;Shangdi&quot;, while approving &quot;Tianzhu&quot; (&#x27;Lord of Heaven&#x27;).

In 1705, Clement sent a legate to the Kangxi Emperor to communicate the interdiction of Chinese rites. The mission, led by Charles-Thomas Maillard De Tournon, communicated the prohibition of Chinese rites in January 1707, but as a result was banished to Macao.

Clement issued the bull on 19 March 1715, which officially condemned the Chinese rites:

Clement&#x27;s decree was reiterated by Benedict XIV in the 1742 bull . Benedict demanded that missionaries in China take an oath forbidding them to discuss the issue again.

==Imperial ban and papal suppression==
In the early 18th century, Rome&#x27;s challenge to the Chinese Rites led to the expulsion of Catholic missionaries from China. In July 1706, the Papal Legate Charles-Thomas Maillard De Tournon angered the Kangxi Emperor, who issued an order that all missionaries, in order to obtain an imperial permit to stay in China, would have to declare that they would follow the rules of Matteo Ricci.

In 1721, the Kangxi Emperor disagreed with Clement&#x27;s decree and banned Christian missions in China. In the &quot;Decree of Kangxi&quot;, he stated,
Chinese converts were also involved in the controversy through letters of protest, books, pamphlets, etc. The Controversy debate was most intense between a group of Christian literati and a Catholic bishop (named Charles Maigrot de Crissey) in Fujian province, with the Chinese group of converts supporting the Jesuits and the bishop supported by less accommodating Iberian mendicants (Dominicans and Franciscans).

In 1724 the Yongzheng Emperor () proscribed the Heavenly Lord sect (the name given to Catholicism during that period). Persecution steadily increased during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor. While the Yongzheng Emperor appreciated and admired the Jesuit Giuseppe Castiglione&#x27;s artwork and western technologies, he also reinforced anti-Christian policies in 1737.

==Pope Pius XII&#x27;s decision==

The Rites controversy continued to hamper Church efforts to gain converts in China. In 1939, a few weeks after his election to the papacy, Pope Pius XII ordered the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples to relax certain aspects of Clement XI&#x27;s and Benedict XIV&#x27;s decrees. After the Apostolic Vicars had received guarantees from the Manchukuo Government that confirmed the mere &quot;civil&quot; characteristics of the so-called &quot;Chinese rites&quot;, the Holy See released, on 8 December 1939, a new decree, known as &quot;Plane Compertum&quot;, stating:

Overall, &quot;Plane Compertum&quot; asserted:
* Catholics are permitted to be present at ceremonies in honor of Confucius in Confucian temples or in schools;
* Erection of an image of Confucius or tablet with his name on is permitted in Catholic schools.
* Catholic magistrates and students are permitted to passively attend public ceremonies which have the appearance of superstition.
* It is licit and unobjectionable for head inclinations and other manifestations of civil observance before the deceased or their images.
* The oath on the Chinese rites, which was prescribed by Benedict XIV, is not fully in accord with recent regulations and is superfluous.

According to Pope Pius XII&#x27;s biographer, Jan Olav Smit, this meant that Chinese customs were no longer considered superstitious, but were an honourable way of esteeming one&#x27;s relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians. Confucianism was also thus recognized as a philosophy and an integral part of Chinese culture rather than as a heathen religion in conflict with Catholicism. Shortly afterwards, in 1943, the Government of China established diplomatic relations with the Vatican. The Papal decree substantially changed the ecclesiastical situation in China.

As the Church began to flourish, Pius XII established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy, and, on 18 February 1946, named Thomas Tien Ken-sin, who was from 18 July 1939 Apostolic Vicar of Qingdao, as the first Chinese national in the Sacred College of Cardinals and later that year – on 10 May 1946 – appointed him to the Archdiocese of Beijing.

<doc id="191859" wikidata="Q446875" url="?curid=191859" title="Antoine-François de Fourcroy">
<text>Antoine François Fourcroy (; 15 June 175516 December 1809) was a French chemist and a contemporary of Antoine Lavoisier. Fourcroy collaborated with Lavoisier, Guyton de Morveau, and Claude Berthollet on the &quot;Méthode de nomenclature chimique&quot;, a work that helped standardize chemical nomenclature.

==Early life==
Fourcroy was born in Paris, the son of an apothecary in the household of the Duke of Orléans. On the advice of the anatomist Félix Vicq-d&#x27;Azyr (1748–1794) he took up medical studies, and after many difficulties caused by lack of means he finally obtained his doctor&#x27;s diploma in 1780. He taught chemistry from (1783–1787) at the Veterinary School of Alfort. Fourcroy&#x27;s attention was turned specifically to chemistry by J. B. M. Bucquet (1746–1780), the professor of chemistry at the Medical School of Paris. In 1784 Fourcroy was chosen to succeed P. J. Macquer (1718–1784) as lecturer in chemistry at the college of the Jardin du Roi, where his lectures attained great popularity.

== Works ==
=== Chemical Work ===
Fourcroy was one of the earliest converts to the views of Lavoisier, which he helped to make widely known by his own voluminous writings. The Royal Society&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of Scientific Papers&quot; enumerates fifty-nine memoirs by Fourcroy alone, and fifty-eight written with others, mostly Louis Nicolas Vauquelin. Fourcroy&#x27;s 1785 publication, &quot;Entomologia Parisiensis, sive, Catalogus insectorum quae in agro Parisiensi reperiuntur ...&quot;, co-written with Étienne Louis Geoffroy, was a major contribution to systematic entomology.

Later with Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, he identified a metal in a platinum residue they called ‘&quot;ptène&quot;’.This name ‘ptene’ or ‘ptène’ was reported as an early synonym for osmium.

=== Biological and Neurochemical Work ===
Fourcroy&#x27;s views and studies grew from Bucquet. Fourcroy was a critic of earlier use of chemistry in medicine and saw great importance in studying the chemical materials of plants and animals, particularly for medical use. The majority of this work was done alongside Vauquelin, who became Fourcroy&#x27;s assistant in 1784. During this period of work with Vauquelin, Fourcroy founded his own journal: &quot;La Médecine éclairée par les sciences physiques, ou Journal des découvertes relatives aux differentes parties de l&#x27;art de guérir,&quot; which detailed his investigations of chemistry and body materials. Fourcroy was convinced that &quot;the successes of chemistry would one day change the face of medicine and result in beneficial revolution.&quot;

Although Fourcroy&#x27;s name appears on a large number of chemical and also physiological and pathological memoirs, he was as much a teacher and an organizer as an original investigator. Beginning in 1791, Fourcroy would go on to publish three memoirs compounding his series of biological experiments, most of which had to do with the chemistry of the human brain. In his first, he described the conditions of the brains of the cadavers that he studied. In his second, he would recount his continuing chemical experimentation on the fatty matter in the brain, now known as lipids, as well as the inorganic components present. By using newer methods than the alchemical tradition that had proceeded him, such as extraction and qualitative analysis, Fourcroy concluded that the brain was composed of fatty acids in combination with bases along with recording some physical properties of the substance. His third memoir was a continuation of the separations and extractions he performed on brain matter and addition to his growing compendium of the brain&#x27;s chemical constituents. One of the most fruitful results of this work was the rediscovery of phosphorus in the brain, reintroducing the 1719 discovery by Johann Thomas Hensing.

Fourcroy also had a prominent role in developing law that would affect medical education in France. Fourcroy collaborated with physician Francois Chaussier to create a report that would be the basis of the Law of 1794, which integrated medicine and surgery and established health schools that taught both of these fields to all students. Prior to this law, medical education was heterogeneous throughout France, with several different colleges and universities operating under varying standards. The law pushed by Fourcroy unified the French medical education system under centralized authority, and led to the issuing of national licensing years later.

=== Work in Laboratory and Medical Clinic Procedure ===
While observing the 18th century clinics of Fourcroy’s time, he observed several problems. Fourcroy noticed that physicians got accustomed to seeing the diseases of an individual patient but failed in considering a large number of cases comparatively. There was also practical problems with this idea, as physician’s individual practices were insufficient in accommodating for large numbers of people with large varieties of issues. To deal with this Fourcroy proposed a program in 1791 to establish more effective clinical laboratories. Along with proposing these hospitals, and the idea that they should be staffed by young physicians well versed in modern sciences, Fourcroy wanted to include material obtained in post-mortem examinations in analysis of humans and how they are affected by disease. This idea was important in linking clinical observations to post-mortem findings, allowing development of new medicine. Although many reform proposals of the time were ignored, Fourcroy had a degree of success because of his political positions. Ultimately, Fourcroy was able to set up a teaching laboratory at the Ecole de Sante in Paris, beginning the development of modern clinical laboratories.

=== Social Contributions ===
Outside the scope of his varied scientific work, Fourcroy was involved in the events taking place during the French Revolution, beginning his participation in 1793, where he strived to make positive impacts to French education. By the end of that year, after holding several positions in the National Convention, he was elected as the president of the Jacobin party, taking a seat on the Committee of Public Safety in the process, which he held for about ten months. He would subsequently hold other high ranking positions and directorships in educational institutes and museums during the revolutionary regime and Napoleon&#x27;s government as well. As an important counselor to Bonaparte, Fourcroy was appointed Minister of Public Instruction in 1802, responsible for education in France at all levels, which he held until his death in December 1809.

==Legacy==

=== &quot;The Chemical Revolution&quot; ===
Fourcroy was not the first to publish the phrase &quot;Chemical revolution,&quot; even Bucquet described new developments in pneumatic chemistry in 1778 as a &quot;great revolution in chemistry.&quot; However, it was Fourcroy that began to better describe the term by lengthening the time scale and broadening the map of nations that were contributing to the Chemical revolution in his written works. It was Fourcroy who had initially noted the division that chemistry had undergone from natural history, concluding that the two studies no longer shared objectives nor methods. While natural historians of his era merely described and preserved that which they studied, as Fourcroy believed, it was chemists who now sought to uncover the most fundamental structures of the natural world by experimental analysis. In his publications, Fourcroy referred to many other contemporary chemists as well as those from other nations, proposing that the extensive chemical reform being done was a collaborative effort.

=== Awards and honors ===
In 1801, Fourcroy was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

On 16 December 1809, the very day on which he died in Paris, Fourcroy was created a count of the French empire. He is buried in the Père-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Antoine-François de Fourcroy&#x27;s 1787 publication entitled &quot;Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique&quot;, published with colleagues Antoine Lavoisier, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented at the Académie des Sciences (Paris) in 2015.

It is believed that Cape Fourcroy, at the western tip of Bathurst Island, Northern Territory, Australia, is named after Fourcroy. The cape was named during Baudin&#x27;s expedition to Australia, and it is known that Baudin had a copy of one of Fourcroy&#x27;s texts with him on the &quot;Géographe&quot;.

===Controversy===
By his conduct as a member of the Convention, Fourcroy has been accused of contributing to Lavoisier&#x27;s death. Baron Cuvier, in his &quot;Eloge historique&quot; of Fourcroy, repelled such charges. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition: although active, though secret, participation cannot be proved against Fourcroy, &quot;he can scarcely be acquitted of time-serving indifference.&quot; See the works in the Bibliography below for other opinions.

=== Modern References ===
In 2014, PBS released a three episode documentary series about the search for the basic chemical elements, highlighting seven historical scientists in particular. In episode one of &quot;The Mystery of Matter: Search for the Elements&quot;, &quot;Out of Thin Air,&quot; Fourcroy&#x27;s character is played by Yan Tual as he assists Lavoisier in his discovery of oxygen.

<text>Michael Ronson (26 May 1946 – 29 April 1993) was an English musician, songwriter, arranger, and producer. He achieved critical and commercial success working with David Bowie as the guitarist of the Spiders from Mars. He was a session musician who recorded five studio albums with Bowie followed by four with Ian Hunter, and also worked as a sideman in touring bands with Van Morrison and Bob Dylan. A classically trained musician, Ronson was known for his melodic approach to guitar playing.

Ronson and Bowie produced Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Transformer&quot; with Ronson playing lead guitar and piano and writing string arrangements, which brought mainstream recognition. The album is considered an influential landmark of the glam rock genre, anchored by Reed&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. The next decade, John Cougar Mellencamp credited Ronson for helping to arrange his most successful hit single, &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot;.

Ronson recorded five solo studio albums, the most popular being &quot;Slaughter on 10th Avenue&quot;, which reached No. 9 on the UK Albums Chart. He played with various bands after his time with Bowie. He was named the 64th-greatest guitarist of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2003 and 41st in 2012 by the same magazine.

==Early life==

Michael Ronson was born in Kingston upon Hull in 1946. He was the first son of George and Minnie Ronson and had two younger siblings, Maggi and David. As a child he was trained classically to play piano, recorder, violin, and (later) the harmonium. He initially wanted to be a cellist, but moved to guitar upon discovering the music of Duane Eddy, whose sound on the bass notes of his guitar sounded to Ronson similar to that of the cello.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter/Ronson1&quot;&gt;Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: &lt;/ref&gt; He joined his first band, The Mariners, in November 1963, when he was 17. His stage debut with The Mariners was in support of the Keith Herd Band at Brough Village Hall, a gig for which the band travelled 35 miles and got paid 10 shillings (50p). While Ronson was working with The Mariners, another local Hull group – The Crestas – recruited him on the advice of The Mariners&#x27; bassist John Griffiths. With Ronson on board the Crestas gained a solid reputation, making regular appearances at local halls: Mondays at the Halfway House in Hull, Thursdays at the Ferryboat Hotel, Fridays at the Regal Ballroom in Beverley, and Sundays at the Duke of Cumberland in North Ferriby.

In 1965, Ronson left The Crestas, moving to London to seek work. He took a part-time job as a mechanic, and joined a band called The Voice, replacing Miller Anderson. Soon afterwards, Crestas&#x27; drummer Dave Bradfield travelled to London, replacing the Voice&#x27;s previous drummer. After playing a few dates with the group, Ronson and Bradfield returned from a weekend in Hull to find their gear piled at their flat and a note explaining that the rest of the group had gone to The Bahamas. Ronson stayed in London and teamed up briefly with a soul band called The Wanted, before eventually returning to Hull. In 1966, he joined Hull&#x27;s top local band, The Rats, joining singer Benny Marshall, bassist Geoff Appleby, and drummer Jim Simpson (who was subsequently replaced by Clive Taylor and then John Cambridge). The group played the local circuit, and made a few unsuccessful trips to London and Paris.

In 1967 The Rats recorded the one-off psychedelic track &quot;The Rise and Fall of Bernie Gripplestone&quot; at Fairview Studios in Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire and can be heard on the 2008 release, &quot;Front Room Masters – Fairview Studios 1966–1973&quot;. 1968 saw the band change their name briefly to Treacle and book another recording session at Fairview Studios in 1969, before reverting to their original name. Around this time, Ronson was recommended by Rick Kemp to play guitar on Michael Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Fully Qualified Survivor&quot; album.

In 1968 Keith &#x27;Ched&#x27; Cheesman joined The Rats replacing Geoff Appleby on bass and the line up of Ronson, Marshall, Cheesman and Cambridge entered Fairview studio to record &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot;, &quot;Stop and Get A Hold of Myself&quot; and &quot;Morning Dew&quot;.
When John Cambridge left The Rats to join his former Hullaballoos bandmate Mick Wayne in Junior&#x27;s Eyes, he was replaced by Mick &quot;Woody&quot; Woodmansey. In November 1969, the band recorded a final session at Fairview, taping &quot;Telephone Blues&quot; and &quot;Early in Spring&quot;.

In March 1970, during the recording sessions for Elton John&#x27;s album &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;, Ronson played guitar on the track &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot;. This song, however, was not included in the original release. The recording featuring Ronson was released on the 1992 compilation album, &quot;Rare Masters&quot;, as well as the 1995 reissue and 2008 deluxe edition of &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;.

==Bowie era==
Early in 1970, John Cambridge came back to Hull in search of Ronson, intent upon recruiting him for a new David Bowie backing band called The Hype. He found Ronson marking out a rugby pitch, one of his duties as a Parks Department gardener for Hull City Council. Having failed in his earlier attempts in London, Ronson was reluctant, but eventually agreed to accompany Cambridge to a meeting with Bowie. Two days later, on 5 February, Ronson made his debut with Bowie on John Peel&#x27;s national BBC Radio 1 show.

The Hype played their first gig at The Roundhouse on 22 February with a line-up that included Bowie, Ronson, Cambridge, and producer/bassist Tony Visconti. The group dressed up in superhero costumes, with Bowie as Rainbowman, Visconti as Hypeman, Ronson as Gangsterman, and Cambridge as Cowboyman. Also on the bill that day were Bachdenkel, The Groundhogs and Caravan. The following day they performed at the Streatham Arms in London under the pseudonym of &#x27;Harry The Butcher&#x27;. They also performed on 28 February at the Basildon Arts Lab experimental music club at the Basildon Arts Centre in Essex, billed as &#x27;David Bowie&#x27;s New Electric Band&#x27;. Also on the bill were High Tide, Overson and Iron Butterfly. Strawbs were due to perform but were replaced by Bowie&#x27;s New Electric Band. John Cambridge left in March, again replaced by Woody Woodmansey. In April 1970, Ronson, Woodmansey, and Visconti started recording Bowie&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; album.

During the sessions for &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, the trio of Ronson, Visconti, and Woodmansey – still under The Hype moniker – signed to Vertigo Records. The group recruited Benny Marshall from The Rats as vocalist, and entered the studio to record an album. By the time a single appeared, The Hype had been renamed Ronno. &quot;4th Hour of My Sleep&quot; was released on Vertigo to an indifferent reception in January 1971. The song was written by Tucker Zimmerman. The B-side was a Ronson/Marshall song called &quot;Powers of Darkness&quot;. The Ronno album was never completed.

Bowie&#x27;s backing ensemble, which now included Trevor Bolder, who had replaced Visconti on bass guitar, and keyboardist Rick Wakeman, were used in the recording of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. The departure of Visconti also meant that Ronson, with Bowie, took over the arrangements, while Ken Scott co-produced with Bowie. &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; featured Ronson&#x27;s string arrangements on several tracks, including &quot;Life On Mars?&quot;.

It was this band, minus Wakeman, that became known as The Spiders from Mars from the title of the next Bowie album. Again, Ronson was a key part of &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;, providing string arrangements and various instrumentation, as well as playing lead guitar. Ronson&#x27;s guitar and arranging during the Spiders from Mars era provided much of the underpinning for later punk rock musicians. In 1972 Ronson provided a strings-and-brass arrangement for the song &quot;Sea Diver&quot; on the Bowie-produced &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; album for Mott the Hoople. Ronson co-produced Lou Reed&#x27;s album &quot;Transformer&quot; with Bowie, playing lead guitar and piano on the songs &quot;Perfect Day&quot; and &quot;Satellite of Love&quot;. Again with Bowie, he re-recorded and produced the track &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; for Lulu, released as a single in the UK, and played on a few tracks on the Dana Gillespie album &quot;Weren&#x27;t Born a Man&quot;. Ronson appeared on the 1972 country rock album &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; by Pure Prairie League, where he undertook string ensemble arrangements. Ronson recorded &quot;Angel #9&quot; for his second solo LP &quot;Play Don&#x27;t Worry&quot;, and string arrangements on &quot;Boulder Skies&quot; and &quot;Call Me, Tell Me&quot; .

His guitar work was next heard on Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; and 1973 covers album &quot;Pin Ups&quot;. However, he was absent from the subsequent &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; album. In September 1983 he was a special guest at the Toronto leg of the Serious Moonlight Tour, playing lead guitar during the performance of &quot;The Jean Genie&quot;. He had only been asked to play the day before, and later recalled:
Bowie said in a 1994 interview that &quot;Mick was the perfect foil for the Ziggy character. He was very much a salt-of-the-earth type, the blunt northerner with a defiantly masculine personality, so that what you got was the old-fashioned Yin and Yang thing. As a rock duo, I thought we were every bit as good as Mick and Keith or Axl and Slash. Ziggy and Mick were the personification of that rock n roll dualism.&quot;

==Later work==
After leaving Bowie&#x27;s entourage after the &quot;Farewell Concert&quot; in 1973, Ronson released three solo albums. His solo debut &quot;Slaughter on 10th Avenue&quot;, featured a version of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, as well as Ronson&#x27;s most famous solo track, &quot;Only After Dark&quot;. In addition, his sister, Margaret (Maggi) Ronson, provided the backing vocals for the set. Between this and the 1975 follow-up, Ronson had a short-lived stint with Mott the Hoople.

He then became a long-time collaborator with Mott&#x27;s former leader Ian Hunter, commencing with the album &quot;Ian Hunter&quot; (UK No. 21) and featuring the UK Singles Chart No. 14 hit &quot;Once Bitten, Twice Shy&quot;, including a spell touring as the Hunter Ronson Band. In 1980, the live album &quot;Welcome to the Club&quot; was released, including a couple of Ronson contributions, although it also contained a few studio-based tracks – one of which was a Hunter/Ronson song. In 1974, Ronson secured the No. 2 spot from a reader&#x27;s poll in &quot;Creem&quot; magazine as the best guitarist that year (with Jimmy Page taking first place), and Eric Clapton in third place after Ronson.

After having recorded, on his &quot;Slaughter on Tenth Avenue&quot; album, Annette Peacock&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m The One&quot; from her album of the same name, he played on tracks on her &quot;X-Dreams&quot; album. 

Ronson contributed guitar to the title track of the 1976 David Cassidy release &quot;Getting It in the Street&quot;. On 11 February 1977 the single &quot;Billy Porter&quot; (b/w &quot;Seven Days&quot;) was released on RCA Victor Records, but did not chart. Roger Daltrey employed Ronson&#x27;s guitar on his 1977 solo release &quot;One of the Boys&quot;. Ronson played guitar on two tracks on the Slaughter &amp; The Dogs album &quot;Do It Dog Style&quot; in 1978. In 1979, Ronson and Hunter produced and played on the Ellen Foley debut album, &quot;Night Out&quot;, with &quot;We Belong to the Night&quot; and the hit single &quot;What&#x27;s a Matter Baby&quot;.

He also played guitar on Roger C. Reale&#x27;s &quot;Reptiles in Motion&quot; album recorded in 1979 and not released until 2019, after the master tapes were acquired from the family of the original rights owners. The label Big Sound, based in Connecticut, had gone bust and the album remained unreleased for forty years.

In 1982, Ronson worked with John Mellencamp on his &quot;American Fool&quot; album, and in particular the song &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot;: &quot;I owe Mick Ronson the hit song &#x27;Jack &amp; Diane&#x27;. Mick was very instrumental in helping me arrange that song, as I&#x27;d thrown it on the junk heap. Ronson came down and played on three or four tracks and worked on the American Fool record for four or five weeks. All of a sudden, for &#x27;Jack &amp; Diane&#x27;, Mick said &#x27;Johnny, you should put baby rattles on there.&#x27; I thought, &#x27;What the fuck does put baby rattles on the record mean? So he put the percussion on there and then he sang the part &#x27;let it rock, let it roll&#x27; as a choir-ish-type thing, which had never occurred to me. And that is the part everybody remembers on the song. It was Ronson&#x27;s idea.&quot; (John Mellencamp, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, January 2008, p.61) Both &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; and &quot;American Fool&quot; topped their respective US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

Ronson was recruited to Midge Ure&#x27;s band for Ure&#x27;s Gift tour in 1985. After weeks of rehearsal, Ronson left the band due to financial disagreements and was replaced by Zal Cleminson.
In 1990, Ronson again collaborated with Hunter on the album &quot;YUI Orta&quot;, this time getting joint credit, as &quot;Hunter/Ronson&quot;. One of the backing singers on the album was Carola Westerlund. While in Sweden, Ronson wrote and produced three new songs with Estelle Millburne and Westerlund as EC2: &quot;I&#x27;m So Sorry&quot;/&quot;Kiss Me&quot; (1990), then a second single as ECII: &quot;Passion&quot; with a B-side cover of J. Kilette and K. Brown&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot;.

In 1993, he again appeared on a Bowie album, &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot;, playing on the track &quot;I Feel Free&quot;, originally recorded by Cream. Ronson and Bowie had already covered this track live 20 years earlier, while touring as Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Ronson also produced Bowie&#x27;s cover of the Morrissey-penned &quot;I Know It&#x27;s Gonna Happen&quot;.

His second and third solo albums were &quot;Play Don&#x27;t Worry&quot; in 1975, and &quot;Heaven and Hull&quot; in 1994. The latter set was only partly completed at the time of Ronson&#x27;s death, and was released posthumously. Artists involved with the album included Bowie, John Mellencamp, Joe Elliott, Ian Hunter, Chrissie Hynde, and Martin Chambers.

Besides Bowie and Hunter, Ronson went on to work as a musician, songwriter and record producer with many other acts. He did not restrict his influence behind the recording desk only to established acts; his production work appears on albums by more obscure artists, such as Payolas, Phil Rambow and Los Illegals, The Mundanes, the Italian band Moda and the Dutch band Fatal Flowers. Ronson produced The Visible Targets, a Seattle, Washington-based group, on their 1983 five track EP, &quot;Autistic Savant&quot;. In 1985, he produced and played on the four song EP &quot;Stillwell Avenue&quot; with the NYC based band XDAVIS.

Ronson was also a member of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Rolling Thunder Revue&quot; live band, and can be seen both on and off-stage in the film of the tour. He made a connection with Roger McGuinn during this time, which led to his producing and contributing guitar and arrangements to McGuinn&#x27;s 1976 solo album &quot;Cardiff Rose&quot;.

In 1982, he participated on lead guitar in a short-lived band with Hilly Michaels on drums and Les Fradkin on bass guitar. One of their recordings from this group, &quot;Spare Change&quot;, appeared on Fradkin&#x27;s 2006 album, &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;. In 1987, Ronson made an appearance on a record by The Toll. Ronson played lead on the band&#x27;s song, &quot;Stand in Winter&quot;, from the album &quot;The Price of Progression&quot;.

In 1991, Ronson produced the Swedish cult band The Leather Nun&#x27;s album, &quot;Nun Permanent&quot;, adding backing vocals and guitar overdubs on several tracks. At the end of the production, during a short visit to his sister in London, Ronson was diagnosed with cancer. In 1992 he produced Morrissey&#x27;s album, &quot;Your Arsenal&quot;. The same year, Ronson&#x27;s final high-profile live performance was his appearance at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. He played on &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; with Bowie and Hunter; and &quot;Heroes&quot; with Bowie. Ronson&#x27;s final recorded session was as a guest on the 1993 Wildhearts album &quot;Earth vs the Wildhearts&quot;, where he played the guitar solo on the song &quot;My Baby is a Headfuck&quot;. Liner notes for the Earth vs The Wildhearts album give credit to Mick Ronson for guitar on the track &quot;My Baby Is A Headfuck&quot; and the &quot;album is dedicated to Mick Ronson&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ronson was married in Bearsville, New York, in March 1977 to Suzanne (Suzi) Fussey, a hairdresser, who worked for David Bowie at the same time that Ronson did. They had a daughter, Lisa, born 10 August 1977, a former vocalist with The Secret History. Ronson had two sons, Nicholas (born 1971) with his girlfriend Denise, as well as Joakim (born 1990) with Carola Westerlund.

==Death and legacy==
Ronson died of liver cancer on 29 April 1993, aged 46. On 6 May, his funeral was held in a Mormon chapel in London, as he had been raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In his memory, the Mick Ronson Memorial Stage was constructed in Queen&#x27;s Gardens, Hull. In 2015, Steve Harley of Cockney Rebel pledged to help raise funds for a new memorial to Ronson. In April 2016, Harley played for free at the Hull City Hall to help kick start the appeal.
A new guitar sculpture memorial to Ronson, designed by student Janis Skodins, was unveiled on 2 June 2017 in Hull&#x27;s East Park, where Ronson used to work as a gardener, now known as the Michael Ronson Garden of Reflection. As part of the Hull 2017 UK City of Culture event programme, a show entitled &quot;Turn and Face the Strange&quot; was created to tell Ronson&#x27;s story, comprising audio recordings of people who grew up with him in Hull.

The show was written by Garry Burnett and Rupert Creed, and featured audio clips from friends and family, video, live narration and songs performed by a live rock band, which included ex-Rats bass player Keith &#x27;Ched&#x27; Cheesman on guitar, Hull-born John Bentley (from Squeeze and a friend of Ronson&#x27;s) on bass, plus John Cambridge, the ex-Rats and Hype drummer who introduced Ronson to Bowie, on drums, fronted on vocals by Hull musician Kristian Eastwood (ex JoKeRz) and rounded out with Hull singer/guitarist Bobby Joyce.

In August 2017 there were six sell-out performances, at the Freedom Centre on Preston Road, close to where Ronson had grown up and is buried. There was a second run of the show, at the larger Hull Truck Theatre, which played to another six sell-out audiences, in February 2018, followed by a further ten show sell-out run in April and May 2019. In August 2019, a new mural designed by artists Lydia Caprani and the Spray Creative group was completed in Bilton Grange.

In October 2017 the documentary, &quot;Beside Bowie: The Mick Ronson Story&quot;, was released by Gross US and directed by Jon Brewer. The documentary covers Ronson&#x27;s life and his first meeting with David Bowie, along with his influence on Bowie&#x27;s rise to fame. With narration by David Bowie, archive footage and contributions from Angie Bowie, Ronson&#x27;s sister, Maggi, and his wife, Suzanne Fussey, Lou Reed, Rick Wakeman, Toni Visconti, Ian Hunter, Bob Harris and many others who knew or worked with Ronson.

<text>Camino (from the Spanish word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;path&quot;) is a discontinued free, open source, GUI-based Web browser based on Mozilla&#x27;s Gecko layout engine and specifically designed for the OS X operating system. In place of an XUL-based user interface used by most Mozilla-based applications, Camino used Mac-native Cocoa APIs. On May 30, 2013, the Camino Project announced that the browser is no longer being developed.

As Camino&#x27;s aim was to integrate as well as possible with OS X, it used the Aqua user interface and integrated a number of OS X services and features such as the Keychain for password management and Bonjour for scanning available bookmarks across the local network. Other notable features included an integrated pop-up blocker and ad blocker, and tabbed browsing that included an overview feature allowing tabs to be viewed all at once as pages.

The browser was developed by the Camino Project, a community organization. Mike Pinkerton had been the technical lead of the Camino project since Dave Hyatt moved to the Safari team at Apple Inc. in mid-2002.

==History==

In late 2001, Mike Pinkerton and Vidur Apparao started a project within Netscape to prove that Gecko could be embedded in a Cocoa application. In early 2002 Dave Hyatt, one of the co-creators of Firefox (then called Phoenix), joined the team and built Chimera, a small, lightweight browser wrapper, around their work. &quot;Chimera&quot; is a mythological beast with parts taken from various animals and as the new browser represented an early example of Carbon/C++ code interacting with Cocoa/Objective-C code, the name must have seemed apt.

The first downloadable build of Chimera 0.1 was released on February 13, 2002. The early releases became popular due to their fast page-loading speeds (as compared with then-dominant Mac browser, Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer version 5 or OmniGroup&#x27;s OmniWeb, which then used the Cocoa text system as its rendering engine).

Hyatt was hired by Apple Computer in mid-2002 to start work on what would become Safari. Meanwhile, the Chimera developers got a small team together within Netscape, with dedicated development and QA, to put together a Netscape-branded technology preview for the January 2003 Macworld Conference. However, two days before the show, AOL management decided to abandon the entire project. Despite this setback, a skeleton crew of QA and developers released Camino 0.7 on March 3, 2003.

The name was changed from Chimera to Camino for legal reasons. Because of its roots in Greek mythology, &quot;Chimera&quot; has been a popular choice of name for hypermedia systems. One of the first graphical web browsers was called Chimera, and researchers at the University of California, Irvine, have also developed a complete hypermedia system of the same name. is Spanish for &quot;path&quot; or &quot;road&quot; (as in El Camino Real, aka the Royal Road), and the name was chosen to continue the &quot;Navigator&quot; motif.

While version 0.7 was primarily a Netscape-driven release kept afloat at the end by open source, version 0.8 was, according to lead developer Pinkerton, &quot;a triumph of open source and open process. People from all around the world helped with patches, QA, bug triage, localization, artwork, and evangelism.&quot;

In March 2005, Camino&#x27;s Web site was moved from the Mozilla Foundation&#x27;s domain &quot;mozilla.org&quot; to the Camino Project&#x27;s domain &quot;caminobrowser.org&quot;.

In September 2005, Pinkerton accepted a position at Google where he worked closely with Google&#x27;s Firefox team and continued to work on Camino during his &quot;twenty percent&quot; time.

Camino 1.0, released on February 14, 2006, was the first browser of the Mozilla family to appear as a universal binary, thanks largely to the efforts of Mark Mentovai, another of the Camino developers.

Camino 2.0, released on November 18, 2009, introduced many new interface features to the browser including movable tabs and tab preview. It was the first Camino release to be Acid2-compliant.

With the release of Camino 2.1 in 2011, the developers announced plans to transition to WebKit for future versions, as Mozilla had dropped support for Gecko embedding.

The final release was 2.1.2 released on March 14, 2012.

On May 30, 2013, Stuart Morgan announced on Camino Blog that Camino had reached its end and was no longer being developed.

== Standards compliance ==
Camino 2.0, released on November 18, 2009, introduced many new interface features to the browser including moveable tabs and tab preview. It was the first Camino release to be Acid2-compliant.

The final release (2.1.2) scores a 99/100 on the Acid3 test.

Camino&#x27;s HTML5 support via the &quot;HTML5 test&quot; standards testbed is limited.

== Multilingual support ==
Camino 2.1.2 is available in the following languages:
* Dutch

<doc id="191863" wikidata="Q219554" url="?curid=191863" title="Kiteboarding">
<text>Kiteboarding or kitesurfing is a sport that involves using wind power with a large power kite to pull a rider across a water, land, snow, sand, or other surface. It combines the aspects of paragliding, surfing, windsurfing, skateboarding, snowboarding, and wakeboarding. Kiteboarding is among the less expensive and more convenient sailing sports.

After some concepts and designs that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s were successfully tested, the sport received a wider audience in the late 1990s and became mainstream at the turn of the century.

It has freestyle, wave-riding, and racing competitions.

The sport held the speed sailing record, reaching before being eclipsed by the Vestas Sailrocket.

Worldwide, there are 1.5 million kitesurfers, while the industry sells around 100,000 to 150,000 kites per year.
Most power kites are leading-edge inflatable kites or foil kites attached by about of flying lines to a control bar and a harness. The kitesurfer rides on either a bidirectional board (a &quot;twin-tip&quot;, similar to a wakeboard), a directional surfboard, or a foil board. They often wear a wetsuit in mild to cold waters. In the early days of the sport, there were significant injuries and some fatalities, but the safety record has improved with better equipment and instruction.

==History==

===Late 20th century===


In October 1977 Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise (Netherlands) received the first patent for KiteSurfing. The patent covers, specifically, a water sport using a floating board of a surfboard type where a pilot standing up on it is pulled by a wind-catching device of a parachute type tied to his harness on a trapeze-type belt. This patent did not result in any commercial interest.

Through the 1980s, there were occasionally successful attempts to combine kites with canoes, ice skates, snow skis, water skis and roller skates.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Dieter Strasilla from Germany developed parachute-skiing and later perfected a kite-skiing system using self-made paragliders and a ball-socket swivel allowing the pilot to sail upwind and uphill but also to take off into the air at will. Strasilla and his Swiss friend Andrea Kuhn also used this invention in combination with surfboards and snowboards, grasskies, and self-made buggies. One of his patents describes in 1979 the first use of an inflatable kite design for kitesurfing.

Two brothers, Bruno Legaignoux and Dominique Legaignoux, from the Atlantic coast of France, developed kites for kitesurfing in the late 1970s and early 1980s and patented an inflatable kite design in November 1987, a design that has been used by companies to develop their own products.

Bill Roeseler, a Boeing aerodynamicist, and his son Cory Roeseler patented the &quot;KiteSki&quot; system, which consisted of water skis powered by a two-line, delta style kite, controlled via a bar-mounted combined winch/brake. The KiteSki was commercially available in 1994. The kite had a rudimentary water launch capability and could go upwind. In 1995, Cory Roeseler visited Peter Lynn at New Zealand&#x27;s Lake Clearwater in the Ashburton Alpine Lakes area, demonstrating the speed, balance, and upwind angle on his &#x27;ski&#x27;. In the late 1990s, Cory&#x27;s ski evolved into a single board similar to a surfboard.

The development of modern-day kitesurfing by the Roeselers in the United States and the Legaignoux in France was carried on in parallel with that of buggying.

In 1996, Laird Hamilton and Manu Bertin were instrumental in demonstrating and popularising kitesurfing off the coast of Maui, while, in Florida, Raphaël Baruch changed the name of the sport from flysurfing to kitesurfing by starting and promoting the first commercial brand of the industry: &quot;Kitesurf&quot;.

In 1997, the Legaignoux brothers developed and sold the breakthrough &quot;Wipika&quot; kite design that had a structure of preformed inflatable tubes and a simple bridle system to the wingtips, both of which greatly assisted water re-launch. Bruno Legaignoux continued to improve kite designs, including developing the bow kite design, which has been licensed to many kite manufacturers.

In 1997, specialized kiteboards were developed by Raphaël Salles and Laurent Ness. By the end of 1998 kitesurfing had become an extreme sport, distributed and taught through shops and schools worldwide. The first competition was held on Maui in September 1998 and was won by Flash Austin.

Starting in 1999, kitesurfing became a mainstream sport with the entry of key windsurfing manufacturers, namely Robby Naish and Neil Pryde. Single direction boards derived from windsurfing and surfing designs became the dominant form of kiteboard.

===21st century===
In 2000, a new freestyle competition, sponsored by Red Bull was launched in Maui. The competition, named Red Bull King of the Air, judged riders on height, versatility, and style. The competition is still held annually in Cape Town, South Africa.

From 2001 onward, twin-tip bi-directional boards became more popular for most flat water riders, with directional boards still in use for surf conditions.

In May 2012, the course racing style of kitesurfing was announced as a sport for the 2016 Rio Olympics, replacing windsurfing. However, after a vote by the General Assembly of the ISAF in November 2012, the RSX windsurfer was reinstated for both Men and Women, resulting in kitesurfing being left out. The ISAF mid-year meeting of May 2013 proposed seeking an eleventh medal to include kitesurfing in 2020 without making any changes to existing events.

In 2014, course-racing kiteboarding was included in the ISAF World Sailing World Cup program. In November 2014, 20 athletes attended the final competition in Abu Dhabi. The first place among women was taken by Elena Kalinina, while the men&#x27;s champion was Great Britain&#x27;s Oliver Bridge.

In 2015, Elena Kalinina won again and received the title of the world champion, ahead of Great Britain&#x27;s Steph Bridge and the Russian Anastasia Akopova. The world champion among men was Maxime Nocher from Monaco, making him the youngest world champion, ahead of Oliver Bridge and Polish native Blazek Ozog.

Kitesurfing was named an official event at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires.

Mixed Kite - Formula Kite was chosen by World Sailing for inclusion in the 2024 Summer Olympics.

==Kitesurfing Records==
===Jump records (height, length, time)===

On August 8, 2023 South African athlete Joshua Emanuel ascended 36.2 meters in the North Sea near Hanstholm, riding the CORE XR Pro 7m kite. The previous record holder for the height of a single jump was Jamie Overbeek at 35.3m.
Nick Jacobsen achieved a previous world record for the highest kite jump, measured by WOO Sports on February 19, 2017 in Cape Town, South Africa, during a session with 40-knot winds. Jacobsen&#x27;s jump reached 28.6 meters high, with an airtime of 8.5 seconds. The record has been broken several times since then, and WOO Sports maintains jump-related leaderboards in different categories (airtime, height, etc.) based on the data recorded and uploaded by its users.

Jesse Richman holds the record for hangtime at 22 seconds, set at Crissy Field in San Francisco, California. Airton Cozzolino holds the record for strapless hangtime at 19 seconds.

===Speed records===
French kitesurfer became the first sailor to break the 50 knots barrier by reaching 50.26 knots on 3 October 2008 at the Lüderitz Speed Challenge in Namibia. On 4 October, (also of France) broke this record with a 50.57 knots run. Similar speeds have been reached in the same location by windsurfers Anders Bringdal and Antoine Albeau, respectively 50.46 and 50.59 knots. These speeds are verified, but are still subject to ratification by the World Sailing Speed Record Council. Earlier in the event, on 19 September, American Rob Douglas reached 49.84 knots (92.30 km/h), becoming the first kitesurfer to establish an outright world record in speed sailing. Previously the record was held only by sailboats or windsurfers. Douglas also became the world&#x27;s third over-50 knots sailor, when on 8 October he made a 50.54 knots (93.60 km/h) run.

On 14 November 2009, Alex Caizergues completed another run of 50.98 knots in Namibia.

October 2010, Rob Douglas became the outright record holder for the short distance 500 meters with 55.65 knots. Sébastien Cattelan became the record holder of France and Europe with 55.49 and was the first rider to reach 55 knots.

On 13 November 2017, French rider became the new world speed record holder in France (Salin-de-Giraud) reaching 57.97 knots or 107.36 km/h.
=== Largest kitesurfing wave ===
While Nuno &quot;Stru&quot; Figueiredo held the record at 62-foot (19-meter) from a 2018 ride at Praia do Norte in Nazaré, Portugal, Patri McLaughlin set a new Guinness World Record on January 22, 2023 (72 feet and four inches (22.04 meters)).

=== Long distance ===

=== Notable journeys ===
Louis Tapper completed the longest recorded solo kite journey, completing 2000 km between Salvador and Sao Luis, Brazil. The journey was completed between July/August 2010 and took over 24 days of kitesurfing. This trip is also the longest solo journey, completed without a support crew, using one kite and a 35-liter backpack .

The previous longest recorded kite journey was by Eric Gramond who completed a 13-day trip of 1450 km along the coast of Brazil.

=== Bering Strait crossing ===
Constantin Bisanz, a 41-year-old Austrian, crossed a stretch of the Bering Strait, embarking from Wales, Alaska, US on 12 August 2011 at 04:00, and arriving in easternmost Russia two hours later, after which he returned by boat to Alaska. It occurred after 2 previously failed attempts, the first of which was on 28 July 2011, in which an incident occurred where he found himself floating in 36 °F water with no board, kite, or GPS unit for 1 hour before being rescued. On his second attempt on 2 August he and two friends sailed half the distance before turning around due to poor wind conditions.

=== Transatlantic crossing ===
A team of six kitesurfers, Filippo van Hellenberg Hubar, Eric Pequeno, Max Blom, Camilla Ringvold, Ike Frans, and Dennis Gijsbers crossed the Atlantic Ocean, from the Canary Islands to the Turks and Caicos Islands a distance of about , from 20 November 2013, to 17 December 2013. Each of the six spent four hours each day surfing, broken into two sessions of two hours each, one during the day, and the other during the night.

==Environments==
Kitesurfing on water includes freestyle and big air using a kiteboard similar to a wakeboard, kiting in waves using small surfboards with or without footstraps or bindings, foiling, and speed kiting.

Land kiting needs a short and light mountain board, feet steered buggies, rollerskates, or sand boards for sand kiteboarding, which is also referred to as &quot;sand kiting&quot;. It is a great cross-training for kitesurfing as many of the mechanisms for kite control transfer to water use.

Skis or snowboards are used on snow for snowkiting.

==Market==
, the number of kitesurfers was estimated by the ISAF and IKA at 1.5 million persons worldwide (pending review). The global market for kite gear sales was then worth US$250 million.
The Global Kitesports Association (GKA) estimates 10% of the kitesurfers continue during winter.
After substantial growth, activity was levelling by 2017 at around 85,000 kites sold yearly by GKA members, twintip boards sales decreased from 37,000 in 2013 to 28,000 in 2016 and directional boards from 8,000 to 7,000.

The largest manufacturers are Boards and More (previously under the North brand, now Duotone), then Cabrinha (Neil Pryde) with 25–35,000 kites a year each.
They are followed by Naish, F-One, Core kiteboarding, Slingshot sports, Liquid Force, Airush, Ozone Kites, Flysurfer and others.
The GKA recorded 100,000 kites sales in 2017 for its members, giving an estimated 140–150,000 total kites sales for 2017.
Technavio predicted a global kiteboarding equipment market reaching US$2,120 million by 2021, growing at a CAGR of almost 9% from 2017.

==Governance==

International kiteboarding has several promoting organizations and has undergone many changes in the governance of the sport, including long-lasting disputes between several of those entities, trying to negate each other the right to promote sporting events. The significance of the associated economic activity could explain part of such turbulence, but the intense rate of innovation and of adoption made it difficult to conceive, regulate and formalize the new competitions, and offer opportunities for new players specializing in new variants of the sport.

Some of those international organizations are (or were):

* The Professional Kiteboard Riders Association (PKRA), and the Kiteboard Pro World Tour (KPWT), both of which promoted several international tour competitions since 2002, however not as Kiting governing bodies.
* The Global Kitesports Association (GKA) - Industry association that federates several industry stakeholders organizers of competition world tours.
* The International Federation of Kitesports Organizations (IFKO), established in 2016 as a not-for-profit kiters association, covering also land and snow kiting, claiming to be the only legal kiting governing body over WS.
* The World Kiteboarding League (WKL) promoted freestyle competitions in 2017.
* The Kiteboarding Riders United (KRU) is an informal union of the professional kiteboarders, since 2016.
* The Kite Park League (KPL) is dedicated to international competitions in kiteboarding parks.
* The International Kiteboarding Association (IKA), based in Gibraltar, a company, not an association, created by World Sailing to unite kite national associations. Organizer of several racing events tours.
* World Sailing (WS), formerly the International Sailing Federation (ISAF), a private company that has promoted sail and boating since 1907. Since 2008, the WS claims to affiliate the IKA as its kiteboard racing body.

Several world cup events are sanctioned by the WS on behalf of the International Olympic Committee, a private association.

KPWT exchanged endorsements with IKA in 2009. Both become opposing parties as the IKA also got an agreement with PKRA. IKA threatened and banned riders who take part in competitions without its endorsement.

In 2015, the PKRA was sold to a group of investors, becoming the Virgin Kitesurfing World Championship (VKWC).

The WS itself has split the governance of its own events between the GKA for the expression disciplines and the IKA for the racing disciplines. The GKA has then split the expression disciplines, choosing to run the Wave and Strapless Tour themselves, while ceding to the World Kiteboarding League to run the freestyle events and the Kite Park League to run the park events. The freestyle events were then handed to the Kiteboarding Riders United (KRU).

==Styles==

Several different kitesurfing styles are evolving, some of which cross over. Styles of kiteboarding include freestyle, freeride, speed, course racing, wakestyle, big air, park, and surfing.

==Techniques==

Kiteboarding can pose hazards to surfers, beachgoers, bystanders and others on the water. Many problems and dangers that may be encountered while learning kiting can be avoided or minimized by taking professional instruction through lesson centers. Kitesurfing schools provide courses and lessons to teach entry-level skills and more advanced ones, including:
* Kite, lines and bar handling and maintenance
* True and relative wind concepts, including basic kite navigation in the wind window
* Landing and launching the kite
* Kite assisted swimming, known as &#x27;body dragging&#x27;
* Water start
* Relaunch and self-rescue techniques
* Navigation rules and best practices regarding safety
* Up-wind and down-wind navigation
* Basic turning or jibing up to &quot;heel turn jibe&quot;
* Dealing with surf and waves
* Pop and controlled jumping and flying
* Board grabs, tricks performed while a rider is jumping or has gained air from popping by grabbing the board in a number of positions with either hand. Each grab has a different name dependent on which part of the board is grabbed and with which hand grabs it. The names generally originate from other board sports like skateboarding and snowboarding
==The wind==
===Wind strength and kite sizes===
Kitesurfers change kite size and/or line length depending on wind strength — stronger winds call for a smaller kite to prevent overpower situations. Kitesurfers determine the wind strength using either an anemometer or, more typically, visual clues as shown in the Beaufort scale. Modern kites dedicated to kitesurfing provide a &quot;depower&quot; option to reduce the power in the kite. By using depower, the kite&#x27;s angle of attack to the wind is reduced, thereby catching less wind in the kite and reducing the pull.

Bow kites have a wider wind range than C-kites, so two kite sizes (such as 7 m2 and 12 m2) could form an effective quiver for winds ranging from 10 to 30+ knots for a 75 kg (165 lb) rider.

===Wind direction and speed===
Cross-shore and cross-onshore winds are the best for unassisted kiteboarding. Direct onshore winds carry the risk of being thrown onto land or stuck in shallows. Direct offshore winds pose the danger of being blown away from the shore in the event of equipment failure or loss of control. However offshore winds can be quite suitable in confined waters, like in a lake or estuary, or when a safety boat is assisting.

The kiter must maintain a clear perception of the wind direction but also of the wind speed. The Beaufort scale is of great assistance in helping users assess the situation. A range of wind up to 33 knots covers the conditions for a safe practice for an experienced rider. A less experienced one should avoid riding with more than 15 knots. Most twintip boards and inflatable kites would be barely rideable below 11 knots, therefore for most cases a user should focus on the winds classified as moderate up to strong.

=== Apparent wind ===
Even if there is no wind blowing, a kiter can act on the kite lines and force it to move, and then, like with a row, it generates some force resulting from the incidence of the air into the kite&#x27;s surface. In a gentle breeze, if the user action increases the air speed around the kite 10 times, the generated force increases 100 times, since the wind force acting on a kite is proportional to the square of the wind speed acting on it. Thus the relevant notion of &quot;apparent&quot; wind, which is the actual wind acting on the moving kite, sail or wing.

The apparent wind is measured taking the moving kite as the reference frame, therefore its other name as &quot;relative wind&quot;. By opposition, the wind measured relatively to the ground is called &quot;true wind&quot;.

While the other wind sports can generate considerable apparent wind, their wind forces are limited by the movement of the user platform, since it is attached more or less rigidly to the wing or sail. In this aspect, kiteboarding seems unique among other wind sports, since it allows the user to generate apparent wind independently of the movement of the user platform, the board. For instance, in the initiating kiteboard technic called &quot;waterstart&quot;, while the user prepares to start in the water, the kite is sent aggressively, generating a propulsive impulse. Then the resulting movement of the board increases tension on the kite lines, which the user controls to manage the riding speed and to navigate at will. The composition of the movements of both the kite and the board, offer the user a great deal of navigation flexibility and creativity, including the possibility to jump significantly, making this a true 3-dimensional sport.

=== Wind power, control lines and kite paths ===
In some way all wind sports harvest the energy of the wind. The greater the volume of the atmosphere available to be harvested by the sails, the bigger the available energy to propel the users. As a taller sailing ship harvests more energy from the wind, so does a kiteboarder with longer lines. Compared to a kiteboarder, a windsurfer can extract a higher ratio of wind energy from the available atmosphere volume, but since such volume is much smaller, the resulting energy could be much less than in kiteboarding.

To increase the power, the kiteboarder typically navigates the kite along an S-shape path, increasing the harvesting of energy since it is traversing most of the atmosphere volume around him. This S-shaped movement is most common when the kiters need a moderate improvement of power. If the user needs an intense improvement of power, it loops the kite. Such loops are stronger when the loop radius is large, and traverses a larger atmosphere volume. The kite loop is an advanced practice, and its power can be quite dangerous. With most modern kites and control bars, to end a kite loop the user just pushes away or releases the bar.

Regarding the length of the lines connecting the kite to the user, longer lines allow the user to harvest wind energy in a larger volume. Due to the boundary layer effect longer lines also allow to harvest stronger winds higher up in the atmosphere. But longer lines make the kite slower to respond to the user actions on the control bar, since the lines form a more pronounced spring-like catenary. Therefore, kitesurfers, who need to react fast to incoming waves, tend to use shorter lines than the other kiters. For safety reasons the newcomers to the sport are usually trained with short lines, limiting the power build up.

=== Wind window ===
The &quot;wind window&quot; is the 180 degree arc of the sky downwind of the rider in which the kite can be flown - roughly one fourth of a sphere&#x27;s surface, which radius is the length of the lines. It is the atmosphere volume in which the kiter can navigate the kite to harvest wind energy.

If the rider is facing downwind on a surface, like the ocean, the wind window covers roughly all the area the rider can see, from the rider&#x27;s peripheral vision on one side, along the horizon to the other side, and then directly overhead back to the first side. If the rider somehow puts the kite out of the window — for example, by riding downwind too quickly and sending the kite directly overhead and behind, the kite stalls and often falls out of the sky.

The eventual inefficiency of the kite can obviate for it to reach the edge of the wind window. In such cases the magnitude of the wind window can be reduced to as little as a 120 degree arc, instead of the expected 180 degree.

The wind window is centered in the user location. Since the user is carried by the board, the wind window is affected by the movement of the board. Therefore, the wind window rotates as the board moves and generates apparent wind into itself. For instance, when the kiter navigates perpendicular to the true wind at a speed equal to the true wind&#x27;s, the apparent wind felt on the board increases 42% compared to the true wind, but rotates 45º against the movement. With such rotation, even if the user keeps the kite at the edge of the wind window for trying to keep it pulling in the travelling direction, the kite lines would be at an angle of 45º downwind of the board path, forcing the kiter to edge the board to oppose its tendency to slip downwind. Such board edging is an indispensable technique for navigating upwind, and can be made at a much more extreme angle to the kite lines, almost up to 90º.

The wind window rotation degrades the performance when riding fast in a path upwind. To minimize the wind window rotation and sail upwind as much as possible, the kiter should keep the slowest board speed without sinking the board by lack of hydrodynamic lift. High flotation boards like surfboards are preferable in such cases. Also, keeping the kite high in window, pulling up the user and the board, is quite efficient in coping both with the reduced hydrodynamic lift of the board and with the intended reduction of the board speed.

=== Arbitrary atmosphere volume swept by the kite ===
The kite is a peculiar sail because it can be swept arbitrarily through the atmosphere, usually in specific patterns, so the user can harvest a significant amount of wind energy, much larger than with an equivalent sail fixed to a mast.

The kite and the lines are light, in the range between 2 and 4 kg, but the aerodynamic drag can be significant since the kite can travel much faster than a windsurf sail. Therefore, part of the energy harvested is spent in the movement of the kite itself, but the remainder propels the user and the board.

For instance, a user riding toward the beach raises the kite to slow it down and convert traction into lift. Then, instead of speed he feels an increase of the force upward, necessary to keep himself above the breaking waves.

Another specific advantage of the kite being able to be swept at will, is that the user can take advantage of the atmosphere boundary layer, either rising the kite to harvest the stronger winds blowing in the higher zone of the wind window, or during overpowering gusts he can drive the kite low, skimming the water near the edge of the wind window.

=== Air temperature and humidity ===
Seasoned kiteboarders frequently attribute to moist and hotter air a notable reduction in kite performance. In fact the lift force of a kite is proportional to the air density. Since both the temperature and the relative humidity are important detrimental factors in the air density, the kiters subjective valuation is correct.

In the range between 10 °C and 40 °C a kite loses approximately 0.4% of lift per degree Celsius. It means that a kiter practicing one given day in the Baltic, and then travelling to the Mediterranean, could experience 10% less pull using the same kite at the same wind speed.

== Equipment ==
With the development of Internet markets for used goods, used but reliable kiteboarding equipment has become much less expensive, significantly reducing the barrier to the adoption of the sport. Moreover, the sport is convenient regarding transportation and storage, since the kites are foldable and the boards are smaller than most surf and paddling boards.

Equipment depreciation can cost between £270 per year for second hand gear, to £1360 per year for brand new, not discounted kites and accessories.
In 2017, 150,000 kites were sold globally, compared to 400,000 surfboards sold each year.

===Power kites===

A power kite is available in two major forms: leading edge inflatables and foil kites.

====Leading edge inflatables====
Leading edge inflatable kites, known also as inflatables, LEI kites, are typically made from ripstop polyester with an inflatable plastic bladder that spans the front edge of the kite with separate smaller bladders that are perpendicular to the main bladder to form the chord or foil of the kite. The inflated bladders give the kite its shape and also keep the kite floating once dropped in the water. LEIs are the most popular choice among kitesurfers thanks to their quicker and more direct response to the rider&#x27;s inputs, easy relaunchability if crashed into the water and resilient nature. If an LEI kite hits the water or ground too hard or is subjected to substantial wave activity, bladders can burst or it can be torn apart.

In 2005, Bow kites (also known as flat LEI kites) were developed with features including a concave trailing edge, a shallower arc in planform, and a distinctive bridle with multiple attachment points along the leading edge. These features allow the kite&#x27;s angle of attack to be altered more and thus adjust the amount of power being generated to a much greater degree than previous LEIs. These kites can be fully depowered, which is a significant safety feature. They can also cover a wider wind range than a comparable C-shaped kite. The ability to adjust the angle of attack also makes them easier to re-launch when lying front first on the water. Bow kites are popular with riders from beginner to advanced levels. Most LEI kite manufacturers developed a variation of the bow kite by 2006. Bow kites with a straight trailing edge are named ´delta´ kites, given their triangular outline.

Early bow kites had some disadvantages compared to classic LEI kites:

* They can become inverted and then not fly properly
* They can be twitchy and not as stable
* Heavier bar pressure makes them more tiring to fly
* Lack of &quot;sled boosting&quot; effect when jumping

In 2006, second generation flat LEI kites were developed, combining near total depower and easy, safe relaunch with higher performance, no performance penalties, and reduced bar pressure. Called Hybrid or SLE kites (Supported Leading Edge), these kites are suitable for both beginners and experts.

In 2008, Naish introduced another kite design, with their &quot;Sigma Series&quot; of kites. These kites are a SLE design and feature a unique &quot;bird in flight&quot; shape with the center of the kite swept back to put much of the sail area behind the tow point, which Naish claims has multiple benefits.

In 2009, the performance revolution shows no sign of slowing. Bridled designs feel more like C kites, and five-line hybrids have better depower capability than ever before. There are more than thirty companies manufacturing Leading edge inflatable kites. The delta-kites are growing in popularity since 2008 with around 12 companies offering delta-kites since 2008/2009.

Between 2009 and 2013 kite technology has continued to grow. Kites have become lighter, more durable, much easier to launch and safer. Manufacturers have continued to add new safety features. This has resulted in a growing number of new riders, both younger and older. In 2013, there are at least 20 &quot;major&quot; kite manufacturers, each with multiple models available. Many of the manufacturers are on their third or fourth generation of kites.

====Foil kites====
Foil kites are also mostly fabric (ripstop nylon) with air pockets (air cells) to provide it with lift and a fixed bridle to maintain the kite&#x27;s arc-shape, similar to a paraglider. Foil kites have the advantage of not needing to have bladders manually inflated, a process which, with an LEI, can take up to ten minutes.
Foil kites are designed with either an open or closed cell configuration.

; Open Cell
: Open cell foils rely on a constant airflow against the inlet valves to stay inflated, but are generally impossible to relaunch if they hit the water, because they have no means of avoiding deflation, and quickly become soaked.

; Closed Cell
: Closed cell foils are almost identical to open cell foils except they are equipped with inlet valves to hold air in the chambers, thus keeping the kite inflated (or, at least, making the deflation extremely slow) even once in the water. Water relaunches with closed cell foil kites are simpler; a steady tug on the power lines typically allows them to take off again. An example for a closed cell kite is the Arc Kite.

====Kite sizes====
Kites come in sizes ranging from 0.7 square meters to 21 square meters, or even larger. In general, the larger the surface area, the more power the kite has. Kite power is also directly linked to speed, and smaller kites can be flown faster in stronger winds. The kite size—wind speed curve tapers off, so going to a larger kite to reach lower wind ranges becomes futile at a wind speed of around eight knots. Kites come in a variety of designs. Some kites are more rectangular in shape; others have more tapered ends; each design determines the kite&#x27;s flying characteristics. &#x27;Aspect ratio&#x27; is the ratio of span to length. High aspect ratios (ribbon-like kites) develop more power in lower wind speeds.

Seasoned kiteboarders may have three or more kite sizes to accommodate various wind levels, although bow kites may change this, as they present an enormous wind range; some advanced kiters use only one bow kite. Smaller kites are used by light riders, or in strong wind conditions; larger kites are used by heavier riders or in light wind conditions. Larger and smaller kiteboards have the same effect: with more available power a given rider can ride a smaller board. In general, however, most kiteboarders only need one board and one to three kites (7-12 sq m in size).

===Other equipment===
* Flying lines are made of a strong material such as ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, to handle the dynamic load in unpredictable wind while maintaining a small cross-sectional profile to minimize drag. They come in lengths generally between seven and thirty-three meters. Experimentation with line lengths is common in kiteboarding. The lines attach the rider&#x27;s control bar to the kite using attachment cords on the kite edges or its bridle. Most power kites use a 3, 4 or 5-line configuration. Most control bars have 4 lines, 2 for most of the propulsive power and 2 for steering and for control of the angle of attack. The 5th line is used to aid in re-launching or to further adjustment of the kite&#x27;s angle of attack, mostly in C-kites.
* The control bar is a solid metal or composite bar that attaches to the kite via the lines. The rider holds on to this bar and controls the kite by pulling at its ends, causing the kite to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise like a bicycle. Typically a &quot;chicken loop&quot; from the control bar is attached to a latch or hook on a spreader bar on the rider&#x27;s harness. Most bars also provide a quick-release safety-system and a control strap to adjust the kite&#x27;s minimum angle of attack. Kite control bars, while lightweight and strong, are usually heavier than water; &quot;bar floats&quot; made of foam may be fixed to the lines right above the harness to keep the bar from sinking if lost in the water. Control bars can be specific to a particular kite type and size and not suitable for use with different kite types.
* A kite harness comes in seat (with leg loops), waist, or vest types. The harness together with a spreader bar attaches the rider to the control bar. The harness reduces the strain of the kite&#x27;s pull from the rider&#x27;s arms, spreading it across part of the rider&#x27;s body. This allows the rider to perform jumps and other tricks while remaining attached to the kite via the control bar. Waist harnesses are the most popular harnesses among advanced riders, although seat harnesses make it possible to kitesurf with less effort from the rider, and vest harnesses provide both flotation and impact protection. Kite harnesses resemble windsurfing harnesses, but with different construction; a windsurfing harness is likely to fail when used for kiteboarding.

* Kiteboard, a small composite, wooden, or foam board. There are now several types of kiteboards: directional surf-style boards, wakeboard-style boards, hybrids that can go in either direction but are built to operate better in one of them, and skim-type boards. Some riders also use standard surfboards, or even long boards, although without foot straps much of the high-jump capability of a kite is lost. Twin tip boards are the easiest to learn on and are by far the most popular. A new trend is kitesurfing with hydrofoil boards, which is difficult but opens new horizons to the riders by allowing them to ride in low winds. The boards generally come with sandal-type footstraps that allow the rider to attach and detach from the board easily; this is required for doing board-off tricks and jumps. Bindings are used mainly by the wakestyle riders wishing to replicate wakeboarding tricks such as KGBs and other pop initiated tricks. Kiteboards come in shapes and sizes to suit the rider&#x27;s skill level, riding style, wind and water conditions.

* A wetsuit is often worn by kitesurfers, except in warmer conditions with light winds. When kitesurfing in strong winds, body heat loss is reduced by wearing a wetsuit. A &quot;shortie&quot; is worn to protect the torso only, and a full suit is used for protection against cool conditions, from marine life such as jellyfish, and also from abrasions if the rider is dragged by the kite. Neoprene boots are required if the beach has much shellfish or hard rocks. Dry suits are also used to kitesurf in cold conditions in winter.
* A safety hook knife is considered required equipment. The corrosion resistant stainless steel blade is partially protected by a curved plastic hook. It can be used to cut entangled or snagged kite lines, or to release the kite if the safety release system fails. Some kitesurfing harnesses are equipped with a small pocket for the knife.
* A helmet is often worn by kitesurfers to protect the head from blunt trauma. Helmets prevent head lacerations, and can also reduce the severity of impact injuries to the head, as well as compression injuries to the neck and spine.
* A personal flotation device or PFD may be required if the kitesurfer is using a boat or personal water craft for support. It is also recommended for kitesurfing in deep water in case the kitesurfer becomes disabled and must wait for rescue.
* An impact vest provides some protection against impacts to the torso area. They also provide some flotation and preclude the harness to climb the chest and hurt the ribs, during high power maneuvers.
* A board leash that attaches the board to the kitesurfer&#x27;s leg or harness is used by some riders. However, many kitesurfing schools discourage the use of board leashes due to the risk of recoil, where the leash can yank the board to impact the rider, which can result in serious injury or even death. Generally, kitesurfers that use a board leash also wear a helmet to help protect against this.
* Signaling devices are useful if the kitesurfer needs to be rescued. This may be as simple as a whistle attached to the knife, or retro-reflective tape applied to the helmet. Some kitesurfers carry a mobile phone or two-way radio in a waterproof pouch to use in an emergency. A small Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) can be carried and activated to send out a distress signal.
* A buddy is important to help with launching and retrieving the kite, and to assist in an emergency.
* A GPS can be used to measure distance travelled, tracks and speed during a session.
* Poncho towels and changing robes are commonly used to dry off and get changed into and out of a wetsuit or swimwear waterside. Poncho towels are more commonly used in warmer weather, whereas changing robes typically have a waterproof shell and provide more insulation for colder temperatures.

== Physical practice ==

Kiteboarding is seen as a mid to high intensity exercise, but freeriding can be a low intensity practice like walking, and is usually done in long sessions of up to 2–3 hours. It is amenable to almost all ages, at least from teenagers up to 70 years old or more. It can be seen as a supplement or a substitute for other fitness practices.

== Safety ==
Power kites are powerful enough to pull the rider like a boat in wakeboarding and to lift their users to diving heights. An uncontrolled kite can be dangerous, especially in environments with solid obstacles. A rider can lose control from falling or from sudden wind gusts, which can occur in the presence of strong winds from squalls or storms (&quot;collard&quot;).

It is possible to be seriously injured after being lofted, dragged, carried off, blown downwind or dashed, resulting in a collision with hard objects including sand, buildings, terrain or power lines or even by hitting the water surface with sufficient speed or height (&quot;kitemare&quot;, a portmanteau of kite and nightmare). Adequate quality professional kiteboarding training, careful development of experience and consistent use of good judgement and safety gear should result in fewer problems in kiteboarding.

=== Weather ===

Weather forecasting and awareness is the principal factor to safe kiteboarding. Lack of weather awareness and understanding the figures is frequent, but avoiding weather problems is possible. Choice of inappropriate locations for kiteboarding where the wind passes over land creating wind shadow, rotor with pronounced gusts and lulls has also factored in many accidents. Paying attention to the weather and staying within the limits of the rider&#x27;s ability provides the safest experience. Kitesurfing close to storm fronts can be particularly dangerous due to rapid changes in wind strength and direction.

=== Aggravating factors ===
Lack of a sufficient downwind buffer distance between the kiter and hard objects has contributed to accidents reducing the available distance and time for reaction. Jumping and being airborne at inappropriate places such as shallow water or near fixed or floating objects can be hazardous. Collisions with wind surfers, other kite boarders or water craft are hazards, particularly at busy locations.

Solo kiteboarding has been a frequent contributing cause to accidents; kiteboarders should try to kite with friends and keep an eye on one another. A kitesurfer can get farther from shore than an easy swim, which is the primary reason kitesurfing in directly offshore winds is discouraged. Marine hazards include sharks, jellyfish, sea otters, dolphins, and even crocodiles, depending on the location. Potential conflicts can also arise from the migratory movements of birds. Drowning has been a factor in severe accidents as well and may have been avoided in some cases through the use of an appropriate flotation aid or impact vest and development of acceptable swimming skills.

=== Safety equipment ===
Some kite designs from late 2005 and onward have included immediate and almost full depower integrated with the control bar and improved quick release mechanisms, both of which are making the sport much safer. However, lack of sufficient practice of emergency depowering the kite and going out in excessively strong or unstable weather can reduce the benefit of high depower kites.Another important part of the safety equipment is the impact vest, which doubles as an improved floatation device. It reduces the severity of eventual impacts, but also improves the user endurance in the long procedures of self-rescue in deep waters, which almost every freeriding kiter experiences sooner or later. It is also important and overlooked as a complement to the harness, precluding it to climb along the chest during powerful kite loops, which otherwise would hurt the ribs.The other important pieces of a reasonable safety kit are the safety hook knife to cut tangled lines, the helmet in a high visibility colour, a wet suit of reasonable thickness, depending on the water temperature, and possibly neoprene boots if the beach has much shellfish or hard rocks.

=== Statistics ===

Accidents can generate serious injuries or even be deadly. 105 accidents were reported in the Kiteboarding Safety Information Database between 2000 and September 2003, with 14 fatalities. In South Africa between October 2003 and April 2004, 83% of search &amp; rescue missions involving kitesurf were in offshore winds with the kite still attached to the harness, uncontrolled in strong winds or impossible to relaunch in weak winds. On 30 missions, there were five injuries: two had bone fractures after being hit by their boards, two others were suffering from critical hypothermia and exhaustion and the fifth was exhausted and lacerated. There were no fatalities.

Advances in hybrid and bow kite designs leads to a better ability to control the power that they provide and effective safety release systems. In 2005, the U.S. kiteboarding fatality rate was 6 to 12 deaths for each 100,000 participants. This is higher than SCUBA diving (~4 to 5 per 100,000) and walking (~2 per 100,000), comparable to motor vehicle traffic (~15 per 100,000), and below paragliding (~88 per 100,000).

However these figures have to be correctly interpreted, since they do not account for the rate of accidents per hour of practice, which would be the telling index. Kiteboarding lends itself to a rather frequent practice, much like a gym program, arguably more frequent than other risky sports like scuba diving. Therefore, further data is required to properly evaluate the risk associated with kiteboarding.

===Kitesurfing safety rules===
While some countries have specific regulations on flying kites that may also apply to kitesurfing, most do not. However a kitesurfer should comply to the sailing rules regulating water crafts in many countries, like the U.S. Coast Guard regulations. Developed from such generic rules a set of kitesurf specific rules or recommendations has been taking form since the beginning of the sport.
The first such rule is the prudential rule: with so many people just discovering water sports, a kiter shouldn&#x27;t assume others adequate knowledge, training or even proper attitude, and be prepared to observe self-preserving distances and always let the others perceive clearly its intentions and its intended path.

Waterstarters have priority: the rider going out from the beach has always priority over the riders coming in.

Kite High Rule - A kiter who is upwind (closest to the wind) must keep their kite high to avoid their lines crossing those of downwind kiters. Similarly, the downwind kiter must keep their kite low to avoid their lines crossing upwind kites. This applies regardless of whether kiters are on the same, or opposing courses.

Clearance Rule - A kiter while jumping must have a clear safety zone of at least 50m downwind because they move downwind during the jump. A rider must also have a clear safety zone of 30m upwind to jump as his lines could touch the kite or the lines of another rider kiteboarding close by (see Kite High rule). It&#x27;s important to also consider potential hazards downwind and crosswind of the rider such as people, buildings, trees and other fixed obstacles. Because of the clearance rule a jumper never has the right of way.

Kiters are also considered as sailing vessels – so all the standard sailing rules apply such as:

Starboard Rule When kiters approach from opposite directions the kiter who has the wind on the starboard (right side, right leg/arm leads in direction of travel) has right of way. The kiter who has the wind on the port side (left side, left leg/arm are leads in direction of travel) shall keep out of the way of the other. In simple terms, this means &quot;keep right&quot; with the kiter coming in the opposite direction passing on the left.

In sailing terms, a sailor or kiter with right of way is entitled to &quot;insist&quot; on exercising that right (warning opposing kiters) by shouting &quot;starboard&quot; clearly and in good time.

Many of the sailing rules of right of way are different expressions that the most maneuverable craft should give way to the less maneuverable one. Therefore, kiters should give way to fishing vessels, but not to a jet ski. Other boating rules such as no-go zones, distance from shore and swimmers also apply. Also surfing rules do apply, so for instance, the rider to catch a wave closer to the crest has the right of way even if not on a starboard tack, freeriders included.

== Terminology and jargon ==
* Air time: the amount of time spent in the air while jumping. This can be remarkably long; the record is Jesse Richman&#x27;s 22 second long jump. Five to ten seconds is not unusual.
* Apparent wind: the kite&#x27;s speed relative to the surrounding air. When kitesurfing in a straight line, the kite&#x27;s apparent wind is a combination of the wind speed and the speed of the kite over the surface, but since the kite is highly steerable the apparent wind can vary widely depending on how the kite is being flown. Most ways of increasing power from the kite involve giving it a higher apparent wind somehow, i.e. diving the kite, riding faster, or riding at a greater angle into the wind. Any of these raises the kite&#x27;s apparent wind speed.
* Back stall: A condition in which the kite ceases to move forward through the air and becomes difficult to control, often resulting in the kite flying backward and crashing. Back stall is often caused by lack of wind or by flying the kite with too great of an angle of attack.
* Big air: performing a high jump utilizing the lift of the kite. The jump is often assisted in its initial stage by the rider being catapulted off the lip of a wave.
* Body dragging: being pulled through the water without standing on a board. This is an early step in the learning process, and is essential before trying the board after flying a trainer kite.
* Boost: to suddenly become airborne.
* Brain fart: to forget an intended trick mid air, resulting in crashing or landing on the water.
* Chicken loop: a hard rubber loop attached to the middle line that has been fed through the control bar. It is used to attach the control bar to the harness so the kitesurfer can produce tension in the lines using their entire bodyweight instead of using purely arm strength.
* Chicken dick / chicken finger/ donkey dick / donkey tail: a hard rubber &quot;tongue&quot; attached to the chicken loop that the rider feeds through the spreader bar hook to prevent the rider from becoming &quot;unhooked&quot;.
*Deathloop: when a kite performs an uncontrollable loop with the kiteboarder still attached, often resulting in serious injuries. See also Kitemare.
* De-power: to reduce the kite&#x27;s power (pull), generally by adjusting the angle of attack of the kite. Most kites and control bars now allow a rider to rig a kite for a number of different power levels before launching, in addition to powering the kite up and down &quot;on the fly&quot; by moving the bar up and down. Depowerability makes a kite safer and easier to handle. Some new kite models, especially &quot;bow&quot; kites, can be de-powered to practically zero power, giving them an enormous wind range.
* DP: dawn patrol; an early morning session.
* Downwind: the direction the wind is blowing toward; to leeward. When a rider is facing downwind the wind is at their back.
* Downwinder: a kitesurfing &quot;trip&quot; (could actually be as short as a few minutes) where the rider starts at one point and ends up at another point downwind of their original position.
* Edge: tilting the board with its edge into the water. Used to control the direction of travel. Learning to edge properly is critical for learning to tack upwind. Edging is one of the fundamental skills of kitesurfing and is one of the ways kitesurfing is different from windsurfing or wakeboarding. While windsurf boards have daggerboards and/or skegs to steer the board upwind while lift and planing is provided by the board itself, generally kiteboards actually combine both functions and the bottom of the board lifts the rider and steers simultaneously. Kiteboard fins are generally much smaller and are for keeping the board in the water (see &quot;tea-bagging&quot;), but are not essential. Because kite boards have a small rocker, a deep edge can allow the board to act as a large low drag fin. Edging in wakeboarding is used for steering the board; whereas in kite boarding not only does edging steer the kite board, it is essential for kite control and controlling board speed. Riding downwind toward the kite subtracts massively from the kite&#x27;s power and helps control board speed as well.
* Facial: total loss of flying kite control while on the beach, resulting in the harnessed rider being dragged face first downwind across rocks and sand.
* Freeride: kiteboarding style. Plain kiteboarding that does not involve tricks or jumping. The main goal is keeping a good edge and ability to traverse upwind. This would normally require a board with little rocker.
* Freestyle: kiteboarding style. Freestyle involves tricks (or combinations of tricks) where the rider is jumping off the water and experiencing enhanced elevation using lift generated from the kite. Freestyle is, weather-wise, a multi-condition concept and is to some degree equipment-specific. &quot;Big air&quot; is commonly associated with freestyle.
* Goofy: the footedness of the rider, with the right foot leading.
* Guinea pig: a person who goes out to test if the wind is rideable or not. If it is, others start riding too. Also known as a Wind-dummy.
* Heel side: the side of a board on the edge where a rider&#x27;s heels are (opposite of toe side). &quot;Riding heel side&quot; is riding with heels down.
* Hindenburg: a kite falling out of the air due to the loss of tension in the control lines, and therefore the loss of kite control. Hindenburging can be caused either by lack of wind or by the kite advancing to a position upwind of the kitesurfer in the wind window, also called &quot;overflying the kite&quot;. The term is a reference to the Hindenburg disaster of 1937.
* Handlepass: while unhooked, passing the control bar behind a riders back while in the air. This is one of the main trick categories in Wakestyle.
* Hot launch: recovering and launching the kite from a position deep inside the wind window so the kite is immediately under maximum power (potentially dangerous). 
* Kiter: the person driving the kite. 
* Kiteloop: is a powered group of tricks where a rider loops the kite through the power zone.
* Kitemare: a kiteboarding accident or dangerous mishap. Kitemares can be deadly.
* Launch: getting the kite in the air. The kite may be launched assisted or unassisted. An assisted launch is generally safer than an unassisted launch.
* Lofted: to get lifted vertically into the air by the kite due to a strong gust of wind. Being lofted has resulted in fatalities when kiters on or near land were dragged into obstacles. The danger can be avoided by minimizing time on land with the kite flying directly overhead, and by not kiting in overpowered situations.
* Luff: when the air flow stalls around the kite. It may then stall and fall out of the sky. Like sails, a luffing kite has rippling and flapping panels. When launching the kite, if the kite is luffing, the rider should move farther upwind, or the person holding the kite should move downwind.
* Mobe: this term has two meanings: either a class of wakestyle tricks involving an invert with a 360-degree spin or a specific trick involving a back roll with a frontside 360 handlepass (while keeping the kite below 45 degrees). The former meaning stems from the latter, which was the first type of mobe to ever be landed. Other types of mobes include: mobe 540, mobe 720, slim chance, KGB, crow mobe, moby dick, Pete Rose, blind pete, crow mobe 540, etc.
* Nuking: wind blowing at great speeds (30-40 knots). These extreme conditions are dangerous for most riders.
* Offshore: wind blowing at the water from the shore. Never ride in offshore winds without some means of recovery, i.e. a chase boat. This is somewhat less important in smaller bodies of water, of course.
* Onshore: wind blowing perpendicular to and directly at the shore from the water. A challenging condition for beginners, especially if waves are present.
* Dookie dive: loss of power during air time resulting in a crash into the water.
* O-Shit loop: two loops on either ends of the bar that are attached to the kite lines and run through rings attached to the bar. A standard leash attachment point.
* Overhead waves: waves or larger from trough to crest.
* Overpowered: the condition of having too much power from the kite. Can be a result of an increase in wind, incorrect kite choice (too large for the conditions), incorrect adjustment, simply going too fast, etc. Experienced riders who are overpowered can switch to a smaller board to compensate, to a degree, although it&#x27;s common to have just one board.
* Pop: height gained above the water using only the board and tension in the lines to get lift, with the kite usually positioned at 45 degrees. Lower kite angles are possible for more experienced riders. Used as a basis for many tricks and regarded as an essential skill for progressing.
* Port: the left side of a vehicle, as perceived by a person on board facing the bow (front).
* Power up: when the kite&#x27;s power increases (suddenly), because of wind gusts or the kite&#x27;s movement.
* Power zone: is the area in the sky where the kite generates the most lift (pull), this is generally between 0 and 60 degrees arc from the center of the downwind direction.
* Raley / Railey: a trick where the rider unhooks and then pops in order to fully extend his body into a &quot;superman&quot; position, before landing. This is a power move that&#x27;s often performed relatively low to the water and forms the basis of more advanced tricks.
* Regular: the footedness of the rider, with the left foot leading.
* Re-launch: a general term for getting the kite back up in the air after crashing it (on land or water). A relaunch is unassisted and requires the rider to follow a kite-specific procedure. As years of development have gone by, the more recent kites are easier to relaunch.
* Rider: kiteboarder.
* S-Bend: when the rider unhooks and performs a raley followed by a front roll. 
* Self rescue: a maneuver by which a rider with a downed kite manipulates the kite in the water to assist them in swimming back to shore. The rider generally wraps up their lines until they reach their kite, then positions their kite so that it is on its back as it would be carried on land but with the wing-tip closer to shore catching the wind. This wing tip acts as a sail and helps pull the rider to shore. This is considered an important manoeuvre to learn.
* Send it: to move the kite aggressively up through the power zone.
* Schlogging: this is riding extremely underpowered. A rider has no power to plane and definitely not enough to jump. A rider and their board bounce from planing on the surface to being dragged in the water.
* Shit hot: the art of stylish smooth moves.
* SLE: Supported Leading Edge. A C-shaped kite with an inflatable leading edge, currently the most advanced kite design available allowing massive de-power.
* Side offshore: wind blowing between sideshore and at a 45-degree angle away from the shore.
* Side onshore: wind blowing between sideshore and at a 45-degree angle toward the shore.
* side shore: winds blowing parallel to the shore. Usually the most desirable direction for kitesurfing.
* Spreader bar: a stainless steel bar that attaches to the rider&#x27;s harness. It has a hook that holds the &quot;chicken loop&quot; when riding hooked in.
* Starboard: the right side of a vehicle as perceived by a person on board facing the bow (front).
* Stomp: to successfully perform a trick.
* Surfstyle: wave riding using surfboards. Ideal conditions are cross shore to cross offshore with the wind blowing in the same direction that the wave is breaking. Boards can be ridden with or without foot straps.
* Tack: the direction being sailed, normally either starboard tack or port tack. In a starboard tack the wind is coming in from the rider&#x27;s starboard (right-hand) side, similar to sailing a boat. In normal riding, the kitesurfer takes a heading as close to into the wind as possible, and in any event leads at some angle slightly upwind, sometimes as much as 45 degrees; jumping or wave riding usually results in traveling downwind, so the net result is to maintain relative position. Alternatively, see &quot;downwinder&quot;.
* Tea-bagging: popping out of and falling back into the water intermittently due to light or gusty wind, poor flying skills, twisted lines etc.
* Toe side: the side of a board on the edge where a riders toes are (opposite of heel side). &quot;Riding toe side&quot; is riding with toes down.
* Underpowered: the condition of having insufficient power from the kite. Can be a result of insufficient wind, choosing a kite that is too small for the wind, rigging incorrectly, board too small, water current in the same direction as the wind, not riding fast enough, etc. A rider who is continuously diving the kite and sending it back up in a sine-wave pattern is usually underpowered.
* Unhooked: riding while the chicken loop is not attached to the harness.
* Upwind: the direction from which the wind is blowing; windward; into the wind.
* VaS conditions: Victory at Sea; rough sea conditions characterized by overhead wind waves causing severe shore break.
* Wakestyle: A style of kiteboarding in which the rider usually uses wakeboarding (or kiteboarding) &quot;boots&quot; for their kiteboard (as opposed to straps and pads), ensuring their feet remain firmly attached at all times (hense the term &quot;Wakestyle&quot;). This style is also associated with performing powered tricks with the kite as low to the water as possible (something generally perceived by kiteboarders to be more difficult and stylish).
* Walk of shame: the act of beach walking back upwind to the location where the kite was originally launched. It could mean that the kiter wasn&#x27;t able to sail upwind.
* Wind-dummy: a person who goes out to test if the wind is rideable or not. If it is, others start riding too. Also known as a Guinea pig.
* Zenith: the location in the wind window directly over the kiter&#x27;s head. This is the neutral position where kitesurfers can place the kite to stop moving or prior to movement. This places the kite in a position more vulnerable to &quot;Hindenburgs&quot; than any other.

== Market data ==
, the number of kitesurfers was estimated by the ISAF and IKA at 1.5 million persons worldwide (pending review). The global market for kite gear sales is worth US$250 million. The markets related to kiteboarding continue developing, as seen in these statistics from 2012:

* 60,000 new kiters annually 
* 180,000 kites sold annually 
* 75,000 boards sold annually 
* 14 board builders 
* 19 kite builders

Evolution of kite sales, worldwide:

* 1999: 29,000
* 2006: 114,465
* 2008: 140,000
* 2012: 180,000

A kiteboarding quiver for a single user could typically include 2-4 kites and 2-3 boards. With the exception of foil kites, these equipment pieces are quite rugged and would last from 3 up to 10 years of active use, and be repaired and resold several times. This aftermarket further improves the market development, removing cost barriers for newcomers. In locations like Portugal in 2018, a newcomer to kiteboarding typically buys a proper hands-on tutorial and then buys a basic set of used equipment for an overall total below €1000.

Transportation and storage is easy because the kites are foldable and the boards are smaller than surf and paddling boards. Compared to other sailing sports, kiteboarding is among the less expensive and more convenient. Moreover, nearby most metropolitan areas, it can be practised almost all year long, since it just requires some wind and a reasonably flat surface, like an estuary, a lake, a sandy strip, or a snow flat.

Despite the image of a youth radical sport, many newcomers are middle age, older than the typical wakeboard or snowboard practitioners. Such trends are quite conspicuous, not so much in the trendy summer holiday locations, but in the low season in metropolitan areas around the globe, where kiteboarding is becoming a regular practice for people of middle income, living in apartments not so close to the waterfront, for a short evasion and substituting for the gym.

<text>Léon Victor Auguste Bourgeois (; 21 May 185129 September 1925) was a French statesman. His ideas influenced the Radical Party regarding a wide range of issues. 

He promoted progressive taxation such as progressive income taxes and social insurance schemes, along with economic equality, expanded educational opportunities, and cooperative solidarism. In foreign policy, he called for a strong League of Nations, and the maintenance of peace through compulsory arbitration, controlled disarmament, economic sanctions, and perhaps an international military force.

==Biography==
Bourgeois was born in Paris in to a modest Republican family of a watchmaker of Burgundian descent, and was trained in law, graduating from his university in 1874. After holding a subordinate office (1876) in the department of public works, he became successively prefect of the Tarn (1882) and the Haute-Garonne (1885), and then returned to Paris to enter the Ministry of the Interior. 

He became Prefect of Police in November 1887 at the critical moment of Jules Grévy&#x27;s resignation from the presidency. In the following year, he entered the Chamber, being elected deputy for the Marne, in opposition to George Boulanger, and joined the Radical Left. He was undersecretary for Home Affairs in Charles Floquet&#x27;s ministry of 1888 and resigned with it in 1889, being then returned to the chamber for Reims. In Pierre Tirard&#x27;s ministry, which succeeded, he was Minister of the Interior, and subsequently, on 18 March 1890, Minister of Public Instruction in the cabinet of Charles Louis de Saulces de Freycinet, a post for which he had qualified himself by the attention he had given to educational matters. In this capacity, he was responsible for some important reforms in secondary education in 1890. 

He retained his office in Émile Loubet&#x27;s cabinet in 1892, and was Minister of Justice under Alexandre Ribot at the end of that year, when the Panama scandals were making the office one of peculiar difficulty. He energetically pressed the Panama prosecution, so much so that he was accused of having put wrongful pressure on the wife of one of the defendants in order to procure evidence. To meet the charge, he resigned in March 1893 but again took office and retired only with the rest of the Freycinet ministry.

In November 1895, he formed his own cabinet, distinctively radical, which fell as the result of a constitutional crisis arising from the persistent refusal of the Senate to vote supply. He was an eminent Freemason and eight of his cabinet members were Freemasons.

The Bourgeois ministry seemed to think that popular opinion would enable them to override what they regarded as an unconstitutional action on the part of the upper house. However, the public was indifferent, and the Senate triumphed. The blow damaged Bourgeois&#x27;s career as an &quot;homme de gouvernement&quot;. As Minister of Public Instruction in the Brisson cabinet of 1898, he organized courses for adults in primary education. After the short ministry, he represented his country with dignity and effect at the Hague Peace Convention, and in 1903 was nominated a member of the permanent court of arbitration.

He held somewhat aloof from the political struggles of the Waldeck-Rousseau and Combes ministries, travelling considerably in foreign countries. In 1902 and 1903, he was elected president of the Chamber. In 1905, he replaced the duc d&#x27;Audiffret-Pasquier as senator for the department of Marne, and in May 1906, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Sarrien cabinet. He was responsible for the direction of French diplomacy in the conference at Algeciras. He was delegate to both Hague Conferences held in 1899 and 1907. Bourgeois also became delegate to Paris Peace Conference and strongly supported the Japanese Racial Equality Proposal as &quot;an indisputable principle of justice&quot;.

Following World War I, he became President of the Assembly of the League of Nations and won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 1920.

A social republican, Bourgeois sought a middle ground between socialism and capitalism which he termed &quot;solidarism&quot;. He believed that the rich had a social debt to the poor which they should pay by the income tax, thus providing the state with the necessary revenue to finance social measures for those living in poverty. However, the Senate opposed his proposal, and opposition grew until his resignation as prime minister.

<text>Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service. RADIUS was developed by Livingston Enterprises in 1991 as an access server authentication and accounting protocol. It was later brought into IEEE 802 and IETF standards.

RADIUS is a client/server protocol that runs in the application layer, and can use either TCP or UDP. Network access servers, which control access to a network, usually contain a RADIUS client component that communicates with the RADIUS server. RADIUS is often the back-end of choice for 802.1X authentication. A RADIUS server is usually a background process running on UNIX or Microsoft Windows.

The Blast-RADIUS attack breaks RADIUS when it is run on an unencrypted transport protocol like UDP.

==Protocol components==
RADIUS is an AAA (authentication, authorization, and accounting) protocol that manages network access. RADIUS uses two types of packets to manage the full AAA process: Access-Request, which manages authentication and authorization; and Accounting-Request, which manages accounting. Authentication and authorization are defined in RFC 2865 while accounting is described by RFC 2866.

===Authentication and authorization===
The user or machine sends a request to a Network Access Server (NAS) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials. The credentials are passed to the NAS device via the link-layer protocol—for example, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) in the case of many dialup or DSL providers or posted in an HTTPS secure web form.

In turn, the NAS sends a RADIUS &quot;Access Request&quot; message to the RADIUS server, requesting authorization to grant access via the RADIUS protocol.

This request includes access credentials, typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user. Additionally, the request may contain other information which the NAS knows about the user, such as its network address or phone number, and information regarding the user&#x27;s physical point of attachment to the NAS.

The RADIUS server checks that the information is correct using authentication schemes such as PAP, CHAP or EAP. The user&#x27;s proof of identification is verified, along with, optionally, other information related to the request, such as the user&#x27;s network address or phone number, account status, and specific network service access privileges. Historically, RADIUS servers checked the user&#x27;s information against a locally stored flat file database. Modern RADIUS servers can do this, or can refer to external sources—commonly SQL, Kerberos, LDAP, or Active Directory servers—to verify the user&#x27;s credentials.
The RADIUS server then returns one of three responses to the NAS: 1) Access Reject, 2) Access Challenge, or 3) Access Accept.

; Access Reject: The user is unconditionally denied access to all requested network resources. Reasons may include failure to provide proof of identification or an unknown or inactive user account.
; Access Challenge: Requests additional information from the user such as a secondary password, PIN, token, or card. Access Challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the Radius Server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the NAS.
; Access Accept: The user is granted access. Once the user is authenticated, the RADIUS server will often check that the user is authorized to use the network service requested. A given user may be allowed to use a company&#x27;s wireless network, but not its VPN service, for example. Again, this information may be stored locally on the RADIUS server, or may be looked up in an external source such as LDAP or Active Directory.

Each of these three RADIUS responses may include a Reply-Message attribute which may give a reason for the rejection, the prompt for the challenge, or a welcome message for the accept. The text in the attribute can be passed on to the user in a return web page.

Authorization attributes are conveyed to the NAS stipulating terms of access to be granted. For example, the following authorization attributes may be included in an Access-Accept:
* The specific IP address to be assigned to the user
* The address pool from which the user&#x27;s IP address should be chosen
* The maximum length of time that the user may remain connected
* An access list, priority queue or other restrictions on a user&#x27;s access
* L2TP parameters
* VLAN parameters
* Quality of Service (QoS) parameters

When a client is configured to use RADIUS, any user of the client presents authentication information to the client. This might be with a customizable login prompt, where the user is expected to enter their username and password. Alternatively, the user might use a link framing protocol such as the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which has authentication packets which carry this information.

Once the client has obtained such information, it may choose to authenticate using RADIUS. To do so, the client creates an &quot;Access- Request&quot; containing such Attributes as the user&#x27;s name, the user&#x27;s password, the ID of the client and the port ID which the user is accessing. When a password is present, it is hidden using a method based on the RSA Message Digest Algorithm MD5.

===Accounting===

Accounting is described in RFC 2866.

When network access is granted to the user by the NAS, an &quot;Accounting Start&quot; (a RADIUS Accounting Request packet containing an Acct-Status-Type attribute with the value &quot;start&quot;) is sent by the NAS to the RADIUS server to signal the start of the user&#x27;s network access. &quot;Start&quot; records typically contain the user&#x27;s identification, network address, point of attachment and a unique session identifier.

Periodically, &quot;Interim Update&quot; records (a RADIUS Accounting Request packet containing an Acct-Status-Type attribute with the value &quot;interim-update&quot;) may be sent by the NAS to the RADIUS server, to update it on the status of an active session. &quot;Interim&quot; records typically convey the current session duration and information on current data usage.

Finally, when the user&#x27;s network access is closed, the NAS issues a final &quot;Accounting Stop&quot; record (a RADIUS Accounting Request packet containing an Acct-Status-Type attribute with the value &quot;stop&quot;) to the RADIUS server, providing information on the final usage in terms of time, packets transferred, data transferred, reason for disconnect and other information related to the user&#x27;s network access.

Typically, the client sends Accounting-Request packets until it receives an Accounting-Response acknowledgement, using some retry interval.

The primary purpose of this data is that the user can be billed accordingly; the data is also commonly used for statistical purposes and for general network monitoring.

==Roaming==
RADIUS is commonly used to facilitate roaming between ISPs, including by:
* Companies which provide a single global set of credentials that are usable on many public networks;
* Independent, but collaborating, institutions issuing their own credentials to their own users, that allow a visitor from one to another to be authenticated by their home institution, such as in eduroam.

RADIUS facilitates this by the use of &quot;realms&quot;, which identify where the RADIUS server should forward the AAA requests for processing.

===Realms===
A realm is commonly appended to a user&#x27;s user name and delimited with an &#x27;@&#x27; sign, resembling an email address domain name. This is known as &quot;postfix&quot; notation for the realm. Another common usage is &quot;prefix&quot; notation, which involves prepending the realm to the username and using &#x27;\&#x27; as a delimiter.
Modern RADIUS servers allow any character to be used as a realm delimiter, although in practice &#x27;@&#x27; and &#x27;\&#x27; are usually used.

Realms can also be compounded using both prefix and postfix notation, to allow for complicated roaming scenarios; for example, somedomain.com\username@anotherdomain.com could be a valid username with two realms.

Although realms often resemble domains, it is important to note that realms are in fact arbitrary text and need not contain real domain names. Realm formats are standardized in RFC 4282, which defines a Network Access Identifier (NAI) in the form of &#x27;user@realm&#x27;. In that specification, the &#x27;realm&#x27; portion is required to be a domain name. However, this practice is not always followed. RFC 7542 replaced RFC 4282 in May 2015.

===Proxy operations===
When a RADIUS server receives an AAA request for a user name containing a realm, the server will reference a table of configured realms. If the realm is known, the server will then &quot;proxy&quot; the request to the configured home server for that domain. The behavior of the proxying server regarding the removal of the realm from the request (&quot;stripping&quot;) is configuration-dependent on most servers. In addition, the proxying server can be configured to add, remove or rewrite AAA requests when they are proxied over time again.

Proxy Chaining is possible in RADIUS and authentication/authorization and accounting packets are usually routed between a NAS Device and a Home server through a series of proxies. Some of advantages of using proxy chains include scalability improvements, policy implementations and capability adjustments. But in roaming scenarios, the NAS, Proxies and Home Server could be typically managed by different administrative entities. Hence, the trust factor among the proxies gains more significance under such Inter-domain applications. Further, the absence of end to end security in RADIUS adds to the criticality of trust among the Proxies involved. Proxy Chains are explained in .

===Security===
Roaming with RADIUS exposes the users to various security and privacy concerns. More generally, some roaming partners establish a secure tunnel between the RADIUS servers to ensure that users&#x27; credentials cannot be intercepted while being proxied across the internet. This is a concern as the MD5 hash built into RADIUS is considered insecure.

==Packet structure==
RADIUS is transported over UDP/IP on ports 1812 and 1813.

The RADIUS packet data format is shown to the right. The fields are transmitted from left to right, starting with the code, the identifier, the length, the authenticator and the attributes.

Assigned RADIUS Codes (decimal) include the following:

The Identifier field aids in matching requests and replies.

The Length field indicates the length of the entire RADIUS packet including the Code, Identifier, Length, Authenticator and optional Attribute fields.

The Authenticator is used to authenticate the reply from the RADIUS server, and is used in encrypting passwords; its length is 16 bytes.

===Attribute value pairs===

The RADIUS Attribute Value Pairs (AVP) carry data in both the request and the response for the authentication, authorization, and accounting transactions. The length of the radius packet is used to determine the end of the AVPs.

==Vendor-specific attributes==

RADIUS is extensible; many vendors of RADIUS hardware and software implement their own variants using Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs). Microsoft has published some of their VSAs. VSA definitions from many other companies remain proprietary and/or ad hoc, nonetheless many VSA dictionaries can be found by downloading the source code of open source RADIUS implementations, for example FreeRADIUS.

RFC 2865 Section 5.26 provides a suggested encoding which most vendors follow:

Some vendors use different formats. For example, some vendors drop the &quot;Vendor Length&quot; field, or they use 2 octets for the &quot;Vendor Type&quot; and/or the &quot;Vendor Length&quot; fields.

RFC 8044 Section 3.14 defines the &quot;vsa&quot; data type which mandates the RFC 2865 Section 5.26 format.

==Security==
The RADIUS protocol transmits obfuscated passwords using a shared secret and the MD5 hashing algorithm. As this particular implementation provides only weak protection of the user&#x27;s credentials, additional protection, such as IPsec tunnels or physically secured data-center networks, should be used to further protect the RADIUS traffic between the NAS device and the RADIUS server. Additionally, the user&#x27;s security credentials are the only part protected by RADIUS itself, yet other user-specific attributes such as tunnel-group IDs or VLAN memberships passed over RADIUS may be considered sensitive (helpful to an attacker) or private (sufficient to identify the individual client) information as well..

The RadSec protocol addresses the issue with legacy RADIUS/UDP security by &quot;wrapping&quot; the RADIUS protocol in TLS. However, the packets inside of the TLS transport still use MD5 for packet integrity checks and for obfuscating the contents of certain attributes.

The Blast-RADIUS attack breaks RADIUS when it is transported by plain UDP by attacking MD5 within RADIUS. RadSec blocks this attack. Another recommended mitigation is to require Message-Authenticator attributes for all requests and responses. has been assigned for the Blast-RADIUS attack.

==History==
As more dial-up customers used the NSFNET a request for proposal was sent out by Merit Network in 1991 to consolidate their various proprietary authentication, authorization and accounting systems. Among the early respondents was Livingston Enterprises and an early version of the RADIUS was written after a meeting. The early RADIUS server was installed on a UNIX operating system. Livingston Enterprises was acquired by Lucent Technologies and together with Merit steps were taken to gain industry acceptance for RADIUS as a protocol. Both companies offered a RADIUS server at no charge. In 1997 RADIUS was published as RFC 2058 and RFC 2059, current versions are RFC 2865 and RFC 2866.

The original RADIUS standard specified that RADIUS is stateless and should run over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). For authentication it was envisaged that RADIUS should support the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) over the Point-to-Point Protocol. Passwords are hidden by taking the MD5 hash of the packet and a shared secret, and then XORing that hash with the password. The original RADIUS also provided more than 50 attribute-value pairs, with the possibility for vendors to configure their own pairs.

The choice of the hop-by-hop security model, rather than end-to-end encryption, meant that if several proxy RADIUS servers are in use, every server must examine, perform logic on and pass on all data in a request. This exposes data such as passwords and certificates at every hop. RADIUS servers also did not have the ability to stop access to resources once an authorisation had been issued. Subsequent standards such as RFC 3576 and its successor RFC 5176 allowed for RADIUS servers to dynamically change a users authorization, or to disconnect a user entirely.

Now, several commercial and open-source RADIUS servers exist. Features can vary, but most can look up the users in text files, LDAP servers, various databases, etc. Accounting records can be written to text files, various databases, forwarded to external servers, etc. SNMP is often used for remote monitoring and keep-alive checking of a RADIUS server. RADIUS proxy servers are used for centralized administration and can rewrite RADIUS packets on the fly for security reasons, or to convert between vendor dialects.

The Diameter protocol was intended as the replacement for RADIUS. While both are Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols, the use-cases for the two protocols have since diverged. Diameter is largely used in the 3G space. RADIUS is used elsewhere. One of the largest barriers to having Diameter replace RADIUS is that switches and Access Points typically implement RADIUS, but not Diameter. Diameter uses SCTP or TCP while RADIUS typically uses UDP as the transport layer. As of 2012, RADIUS can also use TCP as the transport layer with TLS for security.

<doc id="191869" wikidata="Q1896277" url="?curid=191869" title="Stupid White Men">
<text>Stupid White Men ...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation! is a book by American filmmaker Michael Moore published in 2001. Although the publishers were convinced it would be rejected by the American reading public after the September 11 attacks, it spent 50 consecutive weeks on &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list (including eight weeks at number 1) for hardcover nonfiction and went to 53 printings. It is generally known by its short title, &quot;Stupid White Men&quot;.

The book is highly critical of then-recent U.S. government policies in general, especially the policies of the Clinton and then-nascent Bush administrations. Moore&#x27;s &quot;A Prayer to Afflict the Comfortable&quot; was originally published in this book.

==Publication issues==

Moore completed &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; shortly before the September 11, 2001 attacks. His publisher, HarperCollins, initially refused to release the book, fearing bad publicity in the wake of the attacks (despite an advance printing of over 50,000 copies).

HarperCollins wanted Moore to rewrite half of the book. They asked him to tone down criticism of George W. Bush, who had just been elected as President. They also wanted to change the title to &quot;Michael Moore: The American&quot; and remove the chapters &quot;Kill Whitey&quot; (which criticizes what Moore perceives as negative aspects of white American culture), &quot;Dear George&quot; (a negative open letter to Bush), and &quot;A Very American Coup&quot; (which discusses the election in Florida and accuses the Bush campaign of winning via electoral fraud). Furthermore, they demanded that Moore personally pay the $100,000 cost of printing the revised book. If he didn&#x27;t comply, they would abandon the project and pulp the copies already printed. In the book, Moore suggests that Rupert Murdoch, owner of News Corporation and HarperCollins, &quot;passed down&quot; this decision.

On December 1, Moore made a presentation in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He told the audience about the struggle to get his book published and that the only copies in existence were about to be recycled and probably would come back as Rush Limbaugh or Bill O&#x27;Reilly books. Moore read the first chapters of his book to the group. In the audience that day was Ann Sparanese, a librarian from Englewood, New Jersey. Sparanese sent word to various email lists including the Social Responsibilities Round Table (SRRT) and Library Juice, explaining Moore&#x27;s predicament. She said, &quot;[T]his battle wasn&#x27;t just one man&#x27;s struggle with a publishing house, but was a battle to preserve free speech and to stop censorship&quot;. Moore was unaware of this until he received an angry phone call from HarperCollins two days after the reading.

Despite HarperCollins&#x27; predictions—and, according to Moore, their deliberately limited promotion of the book—it became enormously popular, becoming the highest-selling nonfiction book in 2002 at such major outlets as Barnes &amp; Noble and Amazon.com. It became the top-selling title in its native United States and other countries including the United Kingdom (including being the number one seller on Amazon.co.uk before a British printing was even proposed), Germany, and Ireland.

This book and other works by Moore were subsequently criticized in another book, &quot;Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man&quot;, which HarperCollins published.

<text>William Thomas Gaddis Jr. (December 29, 1922 – December 16, 1998) was an American novelist.
The first and longest of his five novels, &quot;The Recognitions&quot;, was named one of TIME magazine&#x27;s 100 best novels from 1923 to 2005
and two others, &quot;J R&quot; and &quot;A Frolic of His Own&quot;, won the annual U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.
A collection of his essays was published posthumously as &quot;The Rush for Second Place&quot; (2002). &quot;The Letters of William Gaddis&quot; was published by Dalkey Archive Press in February 2013.

A MacArthur Fellow, Gaddis is widely considered one of the first and most important American postmodern writers.

==Life and career==
Gaddis was born in New York City to William Thomas Gaddis, who worked &quot;on Wall Street and in politics&quot;, and Edith (Charles) Gaddis, who worked her way up from being secretary to the president of the New York Steam Corporation to an executive position as its chief purchasing agent. When he was three, his parents separated and Gaddis was subsequently raised by his mother in Massapequa, Long Island. At age 5 he was sent to Merricourt Boarding School in Berlin, Connecticut. He continued in private school until the eighth grade, after which he returned to Long Island to receive his diploma at Farmingdale High School in 1941. He entered Harvard in 1941 where he was a member of &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot; (where he eventually served as president), but was asked to leave in 1944 due to an altercation with police. He worked as a fact checker for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for little over a year (late February 1945 until late April 1946), then spent five years traveling in Mexico, Central America, Spain, France, England, and North Africa, returning to the United States in 1951.

His first novel, &quot;The Recognitions&quot;, appeared in 1955. A lengthy, complex, and allusive work, it had to wait to find its audience. Newspaper reviewers considered it overly intellectual, overwritten, and disgusting. Seven years later, the book was defended by Jack Green in a series of broadsheets blasting the critics; the series was collected later under the title &quot;Fire the Bastards!&quot;.

Gaddis then turned to public relations work and the making of documentary films to support himself and his family. In this role he worked for Pfizer, Eastman Kodak, IBM, and the United States Army, among others. He also received a National Institute of Arts and Letters grant, a Rockefeller grant, and two National Endowment for the Arts grants, all of which helped him write his second novel. In 1975 he published &quot;J R&quot;, told almost entirely in unattributed dialogue. Its eponymous protagonist, an 11-year-old, learns enough about the stock market from a class field trip to build a financial empire of his own. Critical opinion had caught up with him, and the book won the National Book Award for Fiction.

&quot;Carpenter&#x27;s Gothic&quot; (1985) offered a shorter and more accessible picture of Gaddis&#x27;s sardonic worldview, focusing on religious fundamentalism and apocalyptic thinking. Instead of struggling against misanthropy (as in &quot;The Recognitions&quot;) or reluctantly giving ground to it (as in &quot;J R&quot;), &quot;Carpenter&#x27;s Gothic&quot; wallows in it. The continual litigation that was a theme in that book becomes the central theme and plot device in &quot;A Frolic of His Own&quot; (1994)—which earned him his second National Book Award and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction.

Gaddis died at home in East Hampton, New York, of prostate cancer on December 16, 1998, but not before creating his final work, &quot;Agapē Agape&quot; (the first word of the title is the Greek &quot;agapē&quot;, meaning divine, unconditional love), which was published in 2002, a novella in the form of the last words of a character similar but not identical to his creator. &quot;The Rush for Second Place&quot;, published at the same time, collected most of Gaddis&#x27;s previously published nonfiction.

==Family life==
In May 1955 Gaddis eloped with Patsy Thompson Black (1928–2000), a model and actress who had come to New York from North Carolina to break into theater. They had two children: Sarah (b. September 1955)—who wrote a novel, &quot;Swallow Hard&quot; (1991), inspired by her relationship with her father—and Matthew (b. January 1958). Their marriage ended in divorce in 1965. In 1968 Gaddis married Judith Thompson (1940–2022), a journalist and later an antiques dealer. They separated in 1978, and the following year he reunited with Muriel Murphy Oxenberg (1926–2008), whom he had first met in 1953. They lived together until around the time when &quot;A Frolic of His Own&quot; was published (1994), which is dedicated to her. Gaddis lived alone for the remainder of his life.

==Legacy and influence==
Among fans of post-modern fiction, Gaddis is often acknowledged as being one of the greatest of American post-war novelists. A critic who early on appreciated his work and recognized its value is Steven Moore: in 1982 he published &quot;A Reader&#x27;s Guide to William Gaddis&#x27;s &quot;The Recognitions&quot;&quot; and in 1989 a monograph on Gaddis in the Twayne series. Gaddis&#x27;s influence is vast (although frequently subterranean): for example, postmodern authors such as Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon seem to have been influenced by Gaddis (indeed, upon publication of &quot;V.&quot;, Pynchon was actually speculated to have been a pen name for Gaddis due to the similarity of styles and the dearth of information about the two authors; the Wanda Tinasky letters also claimed that Gaddis, Pynchon, and Jack Green were the same person), as well as authors such as Joseph McElroy, William Gass, David Markson, and David Foster Wallace, who have all stated their admiration for Gaddis in general and &quot;The Recognitions&quot; in particular.

Jonathan Franzen, who in an essay in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called Gaddis &quot;an old literary hero of mine&quot;, dubbed him &#x27;Mr. Difficult&#x27;, stating that &quot;by a comfortable margin, the most difficult book I ever voluntarily read in its entirety was Gaddis&#x27; nine-hundred-and-fifty-six-page first novel, &quot;The Recognitions&quot;.&quot; Franzen continued: &quot;In the four decades following the publication of &quot;The Recognitions&quot;, Gaddis&#x27;s work grew angrier and angrier. It&#x27;s a signature paradox of literary postmodernism: the writer whose least angry work was written first.&quot;

Characters in fiction based on Gaddis include Harry Lees in Chandler Brossard&#x27;s 1952 novel &quot;Who Walk in Darkness&quot;, Harold Sand in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s autobiographical 1958 novella &quot;The Subterraneans&quot; and possibly Bill Gray in Don DeLillo&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;Mao II&quot;. (DeLillo was a friend of Gaddis.) The characters Richard Whitehurst in Kurt Wenzel&#x27;s &quot;Lit Life: A Novel&quot; (2001) and Joshua Gel in Stephen Dixon&#x27;s &quot;I: A Novel&quot; (2002) likely are based on Gaddis. Other authors who allude to Gaddis in their books include Jonathan Franzen (&quot;The Corrections&quot;), David Markson (&quot;Epitaph for a Tramp&quot;), Joseph McElroy (&quot;A Smuggler&#x27;s Bible&quot;) and Stanley Elkin (&quot;The Magic Kingdom&quot;).

His life and work are the subject of a comprehensive website, The Gaddis Annotations, which has been noted in at least one academic journal as a superior example of scholarship using new media resources. Gaddis&#x27;s papers are collected at Washington University in St. Louis. The first book-length biography, Joseph Tabbi&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Grew but the Business: On the Life and Work of William Gaddis,&quot; was published by Northwestern University Press in May 2015.

His works have been translated into a number of foreign languages, including French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Swedish, Chinese, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Russian.

*The MacArthur Foundation’s &quot;Genius Award&quot; (1982);

<doc id="191871" wikidata="Q11866" url="?curid=191871" title="The Emperor's New Clothes">
<text>&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; ( ) is a literary folktale written by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, about a vain emperor who gets exposed before his subjects. The tale has been translated into over 100 languages.

&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; was first published with &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; in Copenhagen, Denmark, by C. A. Reitzel, on 7 April 1837, as the third and final installment of Andersen&#x27;s &quot;Fairy Tales Told for Children&quot;. The tale has been adapted to various media, and the story&#x27;s title, the phrase &quot;the Emperor has no clothes&quot;, and variations thereof have been adopted for use in numerous other works and as idioms.

==Plot==
The tale concerns an emperor who has an obsession with fancy new clothes, and spends lavishly on them, at the expense of state matters. One day, two con-men visit the emperor&#x27;s capital. Posing as weavers, they offer to supply him with magnificent clothes that are invisible to those who are either incompetent or stupid. The gullible emperor hires them, and they set up looms and pretend to go to work. A succession of officials, starting with the emperor&#x27;s wise and competent minister, and then ending with the emperor himself, visit them to check their progress. Each sees that the looms are empty but pretends otherwise to avoid being thought a fool.

Finally, the weavers report that the emperor&#x27;s suit is finished. They mime dressing him and he sets off in a procession before the whole city. The townsfolk uncomfortably go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear inept or stupid, until a child blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all. The people then realize that they have all been fooled. The emperor is startled, but opts to continue the procession, walking more proudly than ever.

==Sources==
Andersen&#x27;s tale is based on a 1335 story from the (or ), a medieval Spanish collection of fifty-one cautionary tales with various sources such as Aesop and other classical writers and Persian folktales, by Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena (1282–1348). Andersen did not know the Spanish original but read the tale in a German translation titled (&quot;That&#x27;s the way of the world&quot;). In the source tale, a king is hoodwinked by weavers who claim to make a suit of clothes invisible to any man not the son of his presumed father; whereas Andersen altered the source tale to direct the focus on courtly pride and intellectual vanity rather than adulterous paternity.

There is also an Indian version of the story, which appears in the &quot;Līlāvatīsāra&quot; by Jinaratna (1283), a summary of a now-lost anthology of fables, the &quot;Nirvāṇalīlāvatī&quot; by Jineśvara (1052). The dishonest merchant Dhana from Hastināpura swindles the king of Śrāvastī by offering to weave a supernatural garment that cannot be seen or touched by any person of illegitimate birth. When the king is supposedly wearing the garment, his whole court pretends to admire it. The king is then paraded about his city to show off the garment; when the common folk ask him if he has become a naked ascetic, he realizes the deception, but the swindler has already fled.

==Commentaries==
Hollis Robbins, in &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Critique&quot; (2003), argues that the tale is itself so transparent &quot;that there has been little need for critical scrutiny&quot;. Robbins argues that Andersen&#x27;s tale &quot;quite clearly rehearses four contemporary controversies: the institution of a meritocratic civil service, the valuation of labor, the expansion of democratic power, and the appraisal of art&quot;. Robbins concludes that the story&#x27;s appeal lies in its &quot;seductive resolution&quot; of the conflict by the truth-telling boy.

Naomi Wood of Kansas State University challenges Robbins&#x27; reading, arguing that before the World Trade Center attacks of 2001, &quot;Robbins&#x27;s argument might seem merely playful, anti-intuitive, and provocative.&quot; Wood concludes: &quot;Perhaps the truth of &#x27;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&#x27; is not that the child&#x27;s truth is mercifully free of adult corruption, but that it recognizes the terrifying possibility that whatever words we may use to clothe our fears, the fabric cannot protect us from them.&quot;

In 2017, Robbins returned to the tale to suggest that the courtiers who pretend not to see what they see are models of men in a workplace who claim not to see harassment.

==Adaptations==

Various adaptations of the tale have appeared since its first publication.

===Film and television===
1919 Russian short film directed by Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky

In 1953, theatrical short titled &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, produced by UPA.

In 1961, Croatian feature film &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; directed by Ante Babaja, writer Božidar Violić (see IMDb).

In the 1965 Doctor Who serial &quot;The Romans&quot;, the Doctor uses the story as inspiration to avoid his disguise as a lyre player being discovered. He later claims to have given Andersen the original idea for the story in the first place.

In 1970, Patrick Wymark appeared as the Emperor in &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot;, an Australian musical and comedy television special highlighting three of Andersen&#x27;s most famous stories. It was broadcast five weeks after Wymark&#x27;s untimely death in Melbourne.

In 1972, Rankin/Bass Productions adapted the tale as the first and only musical episode of ABC series &quot;The Enchanted World of Danny Kaye&quot;, featuring Danny Kaye (who, 20 years earlier, had portrayed Hans Christian Andersen in the musical of the same name), Cyril Ritchard, Imogene Coca, Allen Swift, and Bob McFadden. The television special features eight songs with music by Maury Laws and lyrics by Jules Bass, and combines live action filmed in Aarhus, Denmark, animation, special effects, and the stop motion animation process &quot;Animagic&quot; made in Japan.

In 1978, this story was used to create a four-episode special of El Chapulín Colorado, a Mexican TV show created by Roberto Gomez Bolaños. In the special, Bolaños is the helper of an arts and crafts worker who pretends to have a fantastic fabric that only smart people can see, using it to trick the king. The special compiled several children stories, from Andersen to Brothers Grimm. The episode is known as &quot;The Valiant Little Tailor&quot;, inspired from the Grimm&#x27;s tale.

In 1985, &quot;Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; adapted the fairy tale, starring Dick Shawn as the Emperor while Alan Arkin and Art Carney starred as the con artists.

The 1987, Japanese war documentary film &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Naked Army Marches On&quot;, by director Kazuo Hara, centers on 62-year-old Kenzō Okuzaki, veteran of Japan&#x27;s Second World War campaign in New Guinea, and follows him around as he searches out those responsible for the unexplained deaths of two soldiers in his old unit.

&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, a 1987 musical comedy adaptation of the fairy tale starring Sid Caesar, part of the Cannon Movie Tales. series

&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; (1991) animated film, by Burbank Animation Studios.

&quot;Muppet Classic Theater&quot; has an adaptation of the story with Fozzie Bear as the emperor, and with Rizzo the Rat and two of his fellow rats as the swindlers.

Despite the phrasing of the title, the 2000 film &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; by Walt Disney Animation Studios is not related to Andersen&#x27;s classic tale, although both stories involve a vain emperor being tricked.

An original video animation (OVA) episode of the anime franchise &quot;Bikini Warriors&quot; humorously adapts the tale, wherein the main characters are stripped nude by an unseen deity under the pretense that it has actually gifted them with a new, legendary bikini armor that only &quot;idiots&quot; are unable to see.

HBO Family aired an animated adaptation called &quot;The Emperor’s Newest Clothes&quot; in 2018. Alan Alda narrated the tale and Jeff Daniels was the voice of the Emperor.

===Music===
On 1 March 1957, Bing Crosby recorded a musical adaptation of the story for children which was issued as an album &quot;Never Be Afraid&quot; by Golden Records in 1957.

In 1968, on their &quot;Four Fairy Tales and Other Children&#x27;s Stories&quot; album, the Pickwick Players performed a version of this story that is actually a version of &quot;The King&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; from the film &quot;Hans Christian Anderson&quot;. In this version, two swindlers trick the Emperor into buying a nonexistent suit, only for a boy to reveal the truth in the end. There are several differences from the original Danny Kaye version, most importantly a new verse (&quot;This suit of clothes put all together is altogether / The most remarkable suit of clothes, that you&#x27;ve already said. The shirt is white, the cape is ermine, the hose are blue,/ And the doublet is a lovely shade of red!&quot;
To which the emperor replies &quot;Green! Glorious Green!&quot; and the Court asks &quot;How could we think it was red!&quot;

The song &#x27;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&#x27; was written and released by Sinead O&#x27;Connor in 1990 on her sophomore album &#x27;I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got.&#x27; She speaks of a system that will be exposed in time &quot;through their own words&quot; - most likely referencing the Catholic Church. 

In 2001, Elton John wrote a song titled &#x27;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&#x27;, for his 26th album Songs from the West Coast, telling the tale of a young couple who &#x27;cheat the system, living a lie wearing a disguise&#x27;. 

==Idiom==
As an idiom, use of the story&#x27;s title refers to something widely accepted as true or professed as being praiseworthy, due to an unwillingness of the general population to criticize it or be seen as going against popular opinion. The phrase &quot;emperor&#x27;s new clothes&quot; has become an idiom about logical fallacies. The story may be explained by pluralistic ignorance or collective illusions. In the story, townspeople pretend to see the emperor&#x27;s non-existent outfit to fit in. Everyone is ignorant to whether the emperor has clothes on or not, but believes that everyone else is not ignorant. This is an example of a situation where &quot;no one believes, but everyone believes that everyone else believes.&quot; Simply put, collective illusions arise when individuals conform to a group&#x27;s false beliefs, often out of social pressure.

== In pop culture ==
In the 2020 video game &quot;Crusader Kings III&quot;, an achievement is titled &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, requiring the player to become an emperor while naked.
