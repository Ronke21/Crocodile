<text>Sir Edward William Watkin, 1st Baronet (26 September 1819 – 13 April 1901) was a British Member of Parliament and railway entrepreneur. He was an ambitious visionary, and presided over large-scale railway engineering projects to fulfil his business aspirations, eventually rising to become chairman of nine different British railway companies.

Among his more notable projects were: his expansion of the Metropolitan Railway, part of today&#x27;s London Underground; the construction of the Great Central Main Line, a purpose-built high-speed railway line; the creation of a pleasure garden with a partially constructed iron tower at Wembley; and a failed attempt to dig a Channel Tunnel under the English Channel to connect his railway empire to the French rail network.

== Early life ==
Watkin was born in Salford, Lancashire, the son of wealthy cotton merchant Absalom Watkin. After a private education, Watkin worked in his father&#x27;s mill business. Watkin&#x27;s father was closely involved in the Anti-Corn Law League, and Edward soon joined him, rising to become a key League organiser in Manchester. Through this work, Watkin gained the friendship of the Radical leader Richard Cobden, with whom he remained in contact for the rest of Cobden&#x27;s life.

From 1839 to 1840 Watkin was one of the directors of the Manchester Athenaeum. In 1843 he wrote a pamphlet entitled &quot;A Plea for Public Parks&quot; and was involved in a committee which successfully sought the provision of parks in Manchester and Salford. He also took a prominent role in the Saturday Half-holiday Movement. In 1845, Watkin co-founded the &quot;Manchester Examiner&quot;, by which time he had become a partner in his father&#x27;s business.

== Railways ==
Watkin began to show an interest in railways and in 1845 he took on the secretaryship of the Trent Valley Railway, which was sold the following year to the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), for £438,000. He then became assistant to Captain Mark Huish, general manager of the LNWR. He visited USA and Canada and in 1852 he published a book about the railways in these countries. Back in Great Britain he was appointed secretary of the Worcester and Hereford Railway.

In January 1854 he became the general manager of the Manchester Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR), a position held until 1861. In 1863 he was persuaded to return as a director of the company and shortly afterward became chairman, holding the position from 1864 to 1894. He was knighted in 1868 and made a baronet in 1880.

Manager from 1858, then president 1862–69, of the Grand Trunk Railway of eastern Canada, he promoted the Intercolonial Railway, which eventually connected Halifax with the GTR system in Quebec. His grand vision was a transcontinental railway lying largely within Canada, but owing to the sparse population west of Lake Superior, the scheme could not be profitable in the absence of government financial backing. Opposition to the idea within the company led to Watkin&#x27;s ouster. The GTR would later miss various opportunities to build a viable Canadian transcontinental railway.

Abroad, he helped to build the Athens–Piraeus Electric Railways, advised on the Indian Railways and organised transport in the Belgian Congo.

Watkin was involved with other railway companies. In 1866 he became a director of the Great Western Railway and in January 1868 the Great Eastern Railway. In fact it was Watkin who recommended Robert Cecil, who is credited with leading the GER out of its financial crisis. Watkin resigned as a director of the GER in August 1872.

By 1881 he was a director of nine railways and trustee of a tenth. These included the Cheshire Lines Committee, the East London, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire, the Manchester, South Junction &amp; Altrincham, the Metropolitan, the Oldham, Ashton &amp; Guide Bridge, the Sheffield &amp; Midland Joint, the South Eastern, the Wigan Junction and the New York, Lake Erie and Western railways.

He was instrumental in the creation of the MS&amp;LR&#x27;s &#x27;London Extension&#x27;, Sheffield to Marylebone, the Great Central Main Line, opened in 1899.

=== Channel tunnel ===
For Watkin, opening an independent route to London was crucial for the long-term survival and development of the MS&amp;LR, but it was also one part of a grander scheme: a line from Manchester to Paris. His chairmanships of the South Eastern Railway, the Metropolitan Railway, in addition to the MS&amp;LR meant that he controlled railways from England&#x27;s south coast ports, through London and (with the London Extension) through the Midlands to the industrial cities of the North; he was also on the board of the Chemin de Fer du Nord, a French railway company based in Calais. Watkin&#x27;s ambitious plan was to develop a railway route which could carry passenger trains directly from Liverpool and Manchester to Paris, crossing from Britain to France via a tunnel under the English Channel. The Great Central Railway&#x27;s main line to London was also built to a comparatively generous structure gauge, but contrary to popular belief it was not built to a &#x27;continental&#x27; gauge, not least because there were no agreed dimensions for such a gauge until the Berne Gauge Convention was signed in 1912. Healy mentions two bridges which were built to &quot;unusual dimensions ... to provide for possible widenings in case the Channel Tunnel project ever took off ...&quot;

Watkin started his tunnel works with the South Eastern Railway in 1880–81. Digging began at Shakespeare Cliff between Folkestone and Dover and reached a length of . The project was highly controversial and fears grew of the tunnel being used as a route for a possible French invasion of Great Britain; notable opponents of the project were the War Office Scientific Committee, Lord Wolseley and Prince George, Duke of Cambridge;

Queen Victoria reportedly found the tunnel scheme &quot;objectionable&quot;. Watkin was skilled at public relations and attempted to garner political support for his project, inviting such high-profile guests as the Prince and Princess of Wales, Liberal Party Leader William Gladstone and the Archbishop of Canterbury to submarine champagne receptions in the tunnel. In spite of his attempts at winning support, his tunnel project was blocked by parliament, then cancelled in the interests of national security. The original entrance to Watkin&#x27;s tunnel works remains in the cliff face but is now closed for safety reasons.

== Wembley Park and Watkin&#x27;s Tower ==

Watkin&#x27;s last project was the construction of a large iron tower, called Watkin&#x27;s Tower, in Wembley Park, north-west London. The tower was to be the centrepiece of a large public amusement park which he opened in May 1894 to attract London passengers onto his Metropolitan Railway. The park was served by Wembley Park station, which officially opened in the same month, though it had in fact been open on Saturdays since October 1893 to cater for football matches in the pleasure gardens.

Watkin&#x27;s vision of Wembley Park as a day-out destination for Londoners had far-reaching consequences, shaping the history and use of the area to the present day. Without Watkin&#x27;s pleasure gardens and station it is unlikely that the British Empire Exhibition would have been held at Wembley, which in turn would have prevented Wembley becoming either synonymous with English football or a successful popular music venue. Without Watkin, it is likely that the district would have simply become inter-war semi-detached suburbia like the rest of west London.

The tower was intended to rival the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The foundations of the tower were laid in 1892, the first stage was completed in September 1895 and it was opened to the public in 1896.

After an initial burst of popularity, the tower failed to draw large crowds. Of the 100,000 visitors to the Park in 1896 rather less than a fifth paid to go up the Tower. Furthermore, the marshy site proved unsuitable for such a structure. Whether the original design (which was to have had eight legs) would have distributed the weight more evenly cannot be known, but by 1896 the four-legged tower was clearly tilting. In addition, Watkin had retired from the chairmanship of the Metropolitan in 1894 after suffering a stroke, so the tower&#x27;s enthusiastic champion was gone. In June 1897 the tower was illuminated for Queen Victoria&#x27;s 60th Jubilee, but it was never extended beyond the first stage.

In 1902 the Tower, now known as ‘Watkin&#x27;s Folly’, was declared unsafe (though this was because of concerns about the safety of the lifts, rather than directly about the subsidence) and closed to the public. In 1904 it was decided to demolish the structure, a process that ended with the foundations being destroyed by explosives in 1907, leaving four large holes in the ground. The Empire Stadium (later known as Wembley Stadium) was built on the site in 1923.

== Political career ==
Throughout his life, Watkin was a strong supporter of Manchester Liberalism. This did not equate to consistent support for a single party. Watkin was first elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Great Yarmouth (1857–1858), and then Stockport (1864–1868). He unsuccessfully contested the East Cheshire seat in 1869. He was knighted in 1868 and became a baronet in 1880. He was also High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1874.

In 1874, he was elected Liberal MP for Hythe in Kent. He increasingly moved away from the Liberal party under William Ewart Gladstone and in 1880 it was claimed that he had taken the Conservative whip. He never stood for election as a Conservative and continued to sit with the Liberals. Between 1880 and 1886, he was regarded variously as a Liberal, a Conservative and an independent. In 1886, he voted against Gladstone&#x27;s Irish Home Rule bill and was thereafter commonly described as a Liberal Unionist.

The confusion over his status came to the fore when he resigned his Hythe seat in 1895. The Liberal Unionists and the Conservatives were in alliance and each claimed incumbency and the right to nominate his replacement. Watkin for his part insisted that he was a Liberal, albeit one who had moved away from the official party. The Conservative Aretas Akers-Douglas commented that no one knew what his politics were, except that he had voted for anyone or anything to get support for his Channel Tunnel. The Conservatives forced the Liberal Unionists to back down and won the seat in the 1895 United Kingdom general election.

== Personal life ==

Watkin lived at Rose Hill, a large house in Northenden, Manchester. The family home was purchased by his father in 1832 and Edward inherited it upon his father&#x27;s death in 1861.

Watkin married Mary Briggs Mellor in 1845, with whom he had two children. Their son, Alfred Mellor Watkin, became locomotive superintendent of the South Eastern Railway in 1876 and Member of Parliament for the Great Grimsby constituency in 1877. A daughter, Harriette Sayer Watkin, was born in 1850. Mary Watkin died on 8 March 1888.

After four years a widower, Watkin married Ann Ingram, widow of Herbert Ingram, on 6 April 1892.

Edward Watkin died on 13 April 1901 and was buried in the family grave in the churchyard of St Wilfrid&#x27;s, Northenden, where a memorial plaque commemorates his life.

<text>The peritrichs (Latin: Peritrichia) are a large and distinctive group of ciliates.

The peritrichs were first defined by Friedrich von Stein in 1859. Initially they were considered spirotrichs, then treated as a separate category, before receiving their modern placement.

==Structure==
They are usually bell or disc shaped, with a prominent paroral membrane arising from the oral cavity and circling counter-clockwise around the anterior of the cell, accompanied by a smaller series of membranelles. The oral cavity is apical and funnel shaped, with a contractile vacuole discharging directly into it. When disturbed, the anterior of the cell can contract. The rest of the body is unciliated, except for a &quot;telotroch band&quot; circling the posterior in mobile species and stages.

==Order Sessilida==
The larger order of Peritrichia are the Sessilida. Most of these have modified posterior kinetosomes which secrete a contractile stalk. The unattached stage, called a telotroch, is mouthless. These are common in both freshwater and marine environments, and many live attached to aquatic plants and animals. They are either solitary or produce branched colonies. A few secrete a lorica. &quot;Vorticella&quot; is one of the best-known genera. Stalks may be as long as 2 mm, and in some cases where they are highly contractile can be extended up to 3 mm.

==Order Mobilida==
The other peritrichs make up the order Mobilida. In these the posterior of the cell is enlarged and modified to form a complex holdfast, allowing the cell to temporarily attach to some host organism. Most live on the integument or gills of freshwater and marine invertebrates, but other hosts occur, including fish and even other ciliates, and other locations as well. Some can be pathogenic for fish.

<text>Slade are a rock band formed in Wolverhampton, England in 1966. They rose to prominence during the glam rock era in the early 1970s, achieving 17 consecutive top 20 hits and six number ones on the UK Singles Chart. The &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; names them the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles. They were the first act to have three singles enter the charts at number one; all six of the band&#x27;s chart-toppers were written by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. As of 2006, total UK sales stood at over 6,500,000. Their best-selling single, &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot;, has sold in excess of one million copies. According to the 1999 BBC documentary &quot;It&#x27;s Slade&quot;, the band have sold more than 50 million records worldwide.

All four members of Slade grew up in the area of England known as the Black Country. After a period in different groups, the four members came together by 1966 as &#x27;N Betweens, and recorded some unsuccessful singles. In 1969 Jack Baverstock of Philips Records signed them and recorded their debut album, changing their name to &quot;Ambrose Slade&quot;, a name inspired by Baverstock&#x27;s secretary, who had named her handbag Ambrose and her shoes Slade. Slade dominated the UK singles charts during the early 1970s. Slade achieved twelve Top 5 hit singles in the UK between 1971 and 1974, three of which went straight to No. 1. Of the 17 Top 20 hits between 1971 and 1976, six made No. 1, three reached No. 2 and two peaked at No. 3. No other UK act of the period enjoyed such consistently high chart placings in the UK Top 40 or sold as many singles. In 1973 alone, &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; sold over one million copies globally, obtaining gold disc status. They toured Europe in 1973 and the US in 1974. Slade have released over 30 albums, three of which reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. Their releases have spent 315 weeks in the UK charts and they have earned 24 top-30 UK hits .

Following an unsuccessful move to the U.S. in 1975, Slade&#x27;s popularity in the UK waned, but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last-minute replacements for Ozzy Osbourne at the Reading Rock Festival. The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career. The original line-up split in 1992, but re-formed later in the year as Slade II. The band have continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have also shortened the group name back to Slade. Slade&#x27;s career was unexpectedly revived when the band were asked to perform at the 1980 Reading Festival when Ozzy Osbourne pulled out at the last minute. For the next two years, the band produced material tailored towards the heavy-metal scene and by 1984, they finally cracked the American market with the hits &quot;Run Runaway&quot; and &quot;My Oh My&quot;. This new-found success did not last long, however, and despite a top-25 UK hit in the early 1990s the band split shortly after in 1992. A number of artists from diverse genres have cited Slade as an influence. &quot;The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Music&quot; tells of Holder&#x27;s powerful vocals, guitarist Dave Hill&#x27;s equally arresting dress sense and the deliberate misspelling of their song titles (such as &quot;Cum On Feel the Noize&quot; and &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot;) for which they became well known.

==Career==
===Early years (1966–1970)===
All the members of Slade grew up in the Black Country. Drummer Don Powell and bassist Jim Lea were born and brought up in Wolverhampton, lead vocalist Noddy Holder was born and brought up in nearby Caldmore in Walsall, and lead guitarist Dave Hill moved to Wolverhampton from Holbeton, Devon as a child. 

In 1964, drummer Don Powell and guitarist Dave Hill were part of a Midland-based group called the Vendors. Regulars on the club circuit, they had also recorded a privately pressed four-track EP. At the time, Noddy Holder was playing guitar and contributing to vocals in Steve Brett &amp; the Mavericks. Signed to Columbia Records, the band released three singles in 1965. After listening to American blues artists such as Sonny Boy Williamson II, John Lee Hooker and Howlin&#x27; Wolf, the Vendors decided on a change of direction and name: As the &#x27;N Betweens they gained greater recognition and began to get supporting gigs with acts such as the Hollies, the Yardbirds, Georgie Fame and Spencer Davis.

The Mavericks and the &#x27;N Betweens were on their way to separate gigs in Germany when they met on a ferry in 1965. Powell and Hill asked Holder if he would be interested in joining The &#x27;N Betweens, but Holder declined. Later, back in their home town of Wolverhampton, the musicians met again and this time Holder agreed to join the group. Jim Lea, whose musical background and strong bass guitar skills were considered an asset, had already been recruited. Lea, who also played the piano and violin, had been in the Staffordshire Youth Orchestra and had gained first class honours in a London music-school practical exam.

By 1966, this new version of the &#x27;N Betweens had recorded a promo single of the Otis Redding track &quot;Security&quot; and a self-penned song, &quot;Evil Witchman&quot;, released on Highland Records. A further single, &quot;You Better Run&quot; was released on Columbia Records and produced by Kim Fowley. This last single was reported by Powell to have topped the regional Midland chart, although it failed to make any national impact. Between 1966 and 1967, the band&#x27;s performance centred on the R&amp;B and Tamla Motown styles, while Holder&#x27;s flair for showmanship began to give the band a focus. During 1967, the band recorded the Honeybus track &quot;Delighted to See You&quot; which remained unreleased until 1994, where it featured on the various artists compilation &quot;Psychedelia at Abbey Road&quot;. Although the group did not record again for roughly two years, they built up a respectable reputation on the live circuit.

A local promoter, Roger Allen spotted the group in 1969 and alerted the head of A&amp;R at Philips Records, Jack Baverstock. The group spent a week in the Philips studio at Stanhope Place recording an album, after which Baverstock offered to sign the group to Fontana Records if they changed their name and obtained London-based management. The band were initially hesitant because of the reputation gained as the &#x27;N Betweens, but eventually agreed to &quot;Ambrose Slade&quot;, a name inspired by Baverstock&#x27;s secretary, who had named her handbag Ambrose and her shoes Slade. Baverstock also found the group an agent, John Gunnel, who had previously worked with the entertainment entrepreneur Robert Stigwood.

The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Beginnings&quot;, released in mid-1969, was a commercial failure, as was the instrumental single &quot;Genesis&quot; and the follow-up single &quot;Wild Winds Are Blowing&quot;. While the album was being recorded, the band were visited by Gunnel and his business partner, Animals&#x27; bassist Chas Chandler. Chandler was impressed with what he heard in the studio, and after seeing the band live the following day, offered to manage them. As Chandler had previous managerial experience with Jimi Hendrix, the band accepted. Chandler was not pleased with the debut album and thought the band would benefit from writing their own material and a change of image. The band adopted a skinhead look as an attempt to gain publicity from what was a newsworthy youth fashion trend, but this also added an unwelcome association with football hooliganism. Noddy Holder and Don Powell were particularly tough-looking individuals already, and the skinhead look exacerbated the disturbing effect of having &quot;toughs&quot; in the band. In 1970, the band shortened their name to Slade and released a new single, a cover of &quot;Shape of Things to Come&quot; which, despite a performance on United Kingdom music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, failed to chart.

Chandler moved Slade to Polydor Records, believing a higher-profile label would boost sales. Lyrics were added to the instrumental &quot;Genesis&quot; from the band&#x27;s debut album, the result being released as &quot;Know Who You Are&quot;, but again, the single failed to make any impression on the UK chart as did the album &quot;Play It Loud&quot;, released in late 1970 and produced by Chandler himself. Later the album was retrospectively well received by fans and critics, and earned a silver disc for sales.

===Glam rock, success and peak (1971–1974)===
Chandler had been managing the band for almost two years without success when he suggested releasing a version of the Bobby Marchan song &quot;Get Down and Get With It&quot;, originally performed by Little Richard. Slade still enjoyed a good reputation as a live act and the song had been used in their performances for many years. Always popular, the song&#x27;s lyrics demanded audience participation and it was hoped that the feeling of a live gig would be projected into the studio recording. The song was released in mid-1971, and by August it entered the top 20 in the UK chart, peaking at number 16.

The band members grew their hair long and allied themselves to the glam rock movement of the early 1970s. Hill&#x27;s stage costumes also became notable during this period. Chandler now demanded the band write a follow-up single themselves which led to Lea and Holder writing &quot;Coz I Luv You&quot;. The song was written in half an hour and started a writing partnership which would continue throughout Slade&#x27;s career. Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one. While recording, the band felt the song&#x27;s sound to be too soft, and so clapping and bootstamping were added. The song&#x27;s misspelled title also became a trademark for Slade while causing a furore among British school teachers. The attendant appearance on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; brought Slade to a wider audience as well as pushing &quot;Coz I Luv You&quot; to number one in the UK Singles Chart. In November 1971, &quot;NME&quot; reported that Slade had turned down a multimillion-dollar campaign, including a television series and a heavily promoted tour of the US. &quot;But&quot;, commented Holder, &quot;acceptance would have meant the cancellation of many commitments here – and the last thing we want to do is to mess around the people who have put us where we are&quot;.

A second single entitled &quot;Look Wot You Dun&quot;, was released at the start of 1972, peaking at number four and a live album was released in March. The album &quot;Slade Alive!&quot; proved to be successful, spending 52 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number two. It also did well abroad, topping the Australian chart and giving the band their first chart entry in America. The album was recorded over three nights at a newly built studio in Piccadilly in front of 300 fan-club members. Today the album is regarded as one of the finest live albums ever made.

Two months later, the band released &quot;Take Me Bak &#x27;Ome&quot;. The single became Slade&#x27;s second UK number one and charted in a number of other countries, including the United States, where it reached number 97 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Slade achieved their third number one when &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot; was released later that year.

Released in November 1972, the album &quot;Slayed?&quot; peaked at number one both in the UK and Australia, where it relegated &quot;Slade Alive&quot; to the second spot; and reaching number 69 in America. Both &quot;Slade Alive!&quot; and &quot;Slayed?&quot; are widely considered to be two of the finest albums of the glam rock era. The final single of 1972, &quot;Gudbuy T&#x27; Jane&quot;, was released shortly after, peaking at number two in the UK. The single was a big worldwide hit but only managed to reach number 68 in the American Billboard Chart.

In early 1973, &quot;Cum on Feel the Noize&quot; was released and went straight to number one, the first time a single had done so since The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Get Back&quot; in 1969. Another worldwide hit for Slade, the single again failed to impress in America where it made number 98. The follow-up single &quot;Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me&quot;, again went straight to number one. Despite being a hit single, &quot;Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me&quot; was never performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; because the producers of the show would not allow Slade to perform as a three-piece band. A promotional video with dancers was shown instead. A car crash in Wolverhampton on 4 July 1973 left Powell in a coma and his 20-year-old girlfriend, Angela Morris, dead. The band&#x27;s future was left in the balance as Slade refused to continue without their drummer; however, Lea&#x27;s brother, Frank, covered Powell&#x27;s position at the Isle of Man Festival to avoid disappointing fans. Powell, who had suffered breaks to both ankles and five ribs, successfully recovered after surgery and was able to rejoin the band ten weeks later in New York, where they recorded &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; – in the middle of a heatwave. Powell still suffers with acute short-term memory loss and sensory problems as a result of the accident. Whilst Powell was recovering, and in an attempt to keep up momentum, the band released a compilation album &quot;Sladest&quot;, which topped the UK and Australian charts in the first week of its release. A new single, &quot;My Friend Stan&quot;, was also released. It marked a change from previous records, being more piano based and sounding more like a novelty song. During the recording sessions, Powell who was walking with the aid of a stick, had to be lifted up to his drum kit. The single was successful, peaking at number two in the UK and number one in Ireland.

The Christmas-themed song &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; was Slade&#x27;s last single of 1973 and became the band&#x27;s last number one in the UK. Prompted by a challenge from Lea&#x27;s mother-in-law to write a seasonal song, the chorus was the melody from a discarded song written by Holder six years previously. It became Slade&#x27;s best-selling single. The song has remained popular and has been released many times since, charting on a number of occasions.

The band began to experiment with different musical styles, moving away from their usual successful rock anthems. Following the success of &quot;My Friend Stan&quot;, Slade released the album &quot;Old, New, Borrowed and Blue&quot;, in February 1974 which went to number one in the UK. Re-titled &quot;Stomp Your Hands, Clap Your Feet&quot;, the album was another disappointment in the US, failing to break into the top 100. The following month saw a new single released. &quot;Everyday&quot; was a piano led ballad which made number three in the UK chart. The next single, &quot;The Bangin&#x27; Man&quot; saw a return to a more guitar-based sound, again reaching the number three position.

===Decline in popularity (1974–1975)===
In the latter half of 1974, the possibility of making a film was being discussed. The band considered a number of screenplays before settling on &quot;Slade in Flame&quot;, a gritty tale of the rise and fall of a fictional 1960s group called Flame; the story was based on true music business events involving Slade and various other groups of the time. A track from the film was released, &quot;Far Far Away&quot;; this reached number two in the UK and topped the charts in Norway and other parts of Scandinavia. Holder has cited the single as his favourite Slade song.

The soundtrack album was released in late November and despite a positive reception from the critics, the disappointing chart position of number six was seen by some as an indication of the band&#x27;s decline in popularity. The film, released in January 1975, received a somewhat mixed reception. Critics loved it, but it was thought that its bleak, noir atmosphere confused Slade fans who were used to Slade delivering a good time. Directed by Richard Loncraine and written by Andrew Birkin, the film featured Tom Conti in his first major film role.

The number 15 position of the film&#x27;s main theme song, &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;, was seen as further proof of the band&#x27;s decline. The ballad, featuring brass instruments and flute, was at the time thought to be too far from the fans&#x27; expectations. Noel Gallagher of the British band Oasis however has claimed the track to be, &quot;one of the best songs written, in the history of pop, ever&quot;. The follow-up in May &quot;Thanks for the Memory (Wham Bam Thank You Mam)&quot; fared slightly better, peaking at number seven in the UK and doing well in a number of other European countries. The single became Slade&#x27;s last top 10 hit of the 1970s.

===Stateside (1975–1977)===
By mid-1975, the band had become disillusioned with their lack of success in America. Feeling that they were becoming stale and had achieved all they could in Europe, Slade decided to a make a permanent move to the States and try to build a solid reputation from live performances; just as they had previously done in the UK. According to the Slade Fan Club newsletter of August and September 1975, the band took twelve tons of equipment, worth approximately £45,000 at the time. Throughout the remainder of 1975 and 1976, Slade toured the US, often with other bands such as Aerosmith, ZZ Top and Black Sabbath, only returning to the UK for TV performances of new singles.

Between tours, Holder and Lea began writing for a new album which was heavily influenced by the US and aimed at an American audience. The group booked themselves into New York&#x27;s Record Plant Studios in mid-1975 to record the album &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fools&quot;. Featuring backing vocals from Tasha Thomas, it contained elements of soul, country and funk music. The first two singles from the new album, &quot;In For a Penny&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Call It Quits&quot; were released in November 1975 and January 1976 respectively, both made number 11 in the UK chart although the latter made no impression outside of the UK. The album, released in March 1976, failed to make any impact in America and was also a disappointment in the UK where it peaked at number 14 and dropped out of the chart completely after four weeks. The final track from the album was the title track &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;. Released in April, it failed to chart at all, the first to do so since the band&#x27;s rise to fame in 1971. Fans within the UK accused the band of &#x27;selling out&#x27; and forgetting about their fan base at home.

===Wilderness years (1977–1980)===

Overall, Slade&#x27;s American venture was seen as a failure, although the band felt improved and rejuvenated. The live success in many cities such as St. Louis, Philadelphia, and New York was not translated into US airplay, however, and the band returned to the UK at the beginning of 1977 to find that punk rock was the new popular style of rock and that they were largely forgotten and out of fashion. Chandler decided not to renew the band&#x27;s contract with Polydor Records, instead signing them to his own record label, Barn Records.

The band&#x27;s first release with Barn Records was the single &quot;Gypsy Roadhog&quot;, in January 1977. The track was performed on the children&#x27;s show &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, but complaints arose due to supposed drug references and the record was subsequently banned by the BBC. This in turn led to the single&#x27;s stalling at number 48 in the UK chart. The title of the subsequent album was taken from a piece of graffiti seen in London, and made reference to the band&#x27;s current position in the public eye: &quot;Whatever Happened to Slade&quot; was released in March and failed to make any chart appearance in the UK. Chandler was reportedly disappointed in the material that Holder and Lea were writing, claiming that the album was not commercial enough, but despite its lack of mainstream success, the album was met with critical praise and support from the English punk movement of the time. Since their return to the UK, the band continued to tour but mainly in smaller venues such as universities and clubs.

&quot;Burning in the Heat of Love&quot;, released a month later, also failed to chart. In October, the band released an amalgamation of two Arthur Crudup songs, entitled &quot;My Baby Left Me/ That&#x27;s All Right&quot; as a tribute to the recent death of Elvis Presley. The single proved to be a moderate success, peaking at number 32 in the UK. Slade was unable to keep momentum for the next single, &quot;Give Us a Goal&quot;, released in March 1978. Based on English football chants, it was intended to appeal to fans of the sport but failed to make any impact, other than making the airplay-based charts of Radio Luxembourg and Manchester&#x27;s Piccadilly Radio. It has however been used in successful advertising campaigns in recent years.

In August 1978, Holder was reportedly involved in a brawl with a bouncer (Desmond Brothers) backstage at The Stoneleigh Club in Porthcawl, South Wales. The bouncer was later jailed for three months for instigating the attack on Holder, after he had told the club bouncers to stop hurting the kids in the crowd who were pushed up against the stage, during the show. Holder showed his mettle by performing the next night as planned, although he had a broken nose, at a club in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire. The story of the attack would later be written into the 1981 single &quot;Knuckle Sandwich Nancy&quot;, which Holder insisted would be released as a single. The band said in contemporary interviews that RCA and Chas Chandler objected to the single&#x27;s release, so it came out on the Cheapskate label, rather than on RCA, the label that they were contracted to.

In late 1978, the band released &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Bolero&quot;, which was another commercial failure. As the band were still a respected live act, and because the 1972 album &quot;Slade Alive!&quot; had been so successful, the group decided to release another live album. &quot;Slade Alive, Vol. 2&quot; consisted of performances recorded during the 1976 Autumn tour of America and the 1977 Spring tour of the UK.

In 1979, the band released a further three singles: &quot;Ginny, Ginny&quot;, &quot;Sign of the Times&quot; and a cover of the party track &quot;Okey Cokey&quot;. All failed to chart. The Slade newsletter of the time announced that &quot;Ginny, Ginny&quot; had made the top 200 in the UK but not the official top 100. In October 1979, the band released a new studio album &quot;Return to Base&quot;, the first album not to have Chandler as producer. Disagreements between Lea and Chandler, centring on business problems and Lea&#x27;s desire to produce Slade&#x27;s material, had been brewing since the recording of &quot;Whatever Happened to Slade&quot; in 1977. Lea in particular disagreed with Chandler on production decisions. As a result, Chandler offered to sever his association with the band. Slade, not wishing to be rid of Chandler entirely, asked him to stay on for the time being as their manager, which Chandler agreed to do. The album was a failure in the UK but the following year it topped both the Telemoustique chart and the official album chart in Belgium. Released exclusively in Belgium, the album&#x27;s version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Rocker&quot; also made number 1.

Slade&#x27;s failures and lack of airplay led Lea to wonder if their material would be better received if recorded by another band. In late 1979, Lea formed The Dummies as a side project, with his brother Frank. They released three singles, which received plenty of radio airplay but sales suffered from distribution problems. In February 1980, Holder was briefly considered as a replacement for Bon Scott, the recently deceased singer of AC/DC. Holder was said to have turned the position down, despite Slade&#x27;s current situation, because of his loyalty to the band. In mid-1980, Slade released their first extended play titled &quot;Six of the Best&quot; which featured three tracks from the &quot;Return to Base&quot; album and three brand new rock tracks. Even though it was being sold for a lower than usual price of £1.49, it still failed to sell enough to make a chart appearance. As a result, the band stopped working together and Hill started driving couples to their weddings in his own Rolls-Royce, to earn money. The business never really took off, as Hill only drove one couple (a pair of fans).

Hill later recalled that during this period Slade &quot;played the difficult gigs, the gigs where people have chicken in a basket and then go on the dancefloor&quot; but noted that they &quot;had an armour of fantastic songs so nobody was going to argue with [them].&quot;

===Comeback and heavy metal following (1980–1982)===

Ozzy Osbourne was due to play the Reading Festival in August 1980, during his Blizzard of Ozz tour, but cancelled at short notice as his band was not ready, leaving the organisers searching for a last-minute replacement. Slade were suggested, but Hill, still demoralised, had effectively left the band and initially refused to take part when asked by the other band members. Eventually, Chandler went to his home and convinced Hill to play what should have been a farewell performance in front of 65,000 rock fans, instead of Slade&#x27;s disbanding and disappearing without a trace. To Hill&#x27;s astonishment, the band stole the show and quickly became the darlings of the music press and radio. Highlights of their performance were broadcast on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Friday Rock Show&quot; Reading special. Afterwards, the band signed to Cheapskate Records, owned by Chandler, Lea and his brother Frank, which gave the band more control of their material and products.

The band&#x27;s new-found success led to a hurriedly released extended play, &quot;Alive at Reading&quot;, which reached number 44, the band&#x27;s first chart action in the UK since 1977. Another extended play followed in November, titled &quot;Xmas Ear Bender&quot; which peaked at number 70. Polydor Records also saw an opportunity to capitalise on the band&#x27;s new success and released the compilation &quot;Slade Smashes!&quot; at the beginning of November. The album was given plenty of promotion and spent 15 weeks in the UK chart, peaking at number 21. The album was certified UK Gold in December, having by then sold over 200,000 copies.

Keen to keep momentum with their new fans, the band set out to write a song with hit potential. The idea for the new track came after a performance in Amsterdam at the Paradiso Club. An enthusiastic audience who would not go home were overheard chanting by Lea, who was downstairs in the dressing room. Realising the potential of the chant, the song &quot;We&#x27;ll Bring the House Down&quot; was written and released in January 1981. Aimed at the new audience which consisted of mainly heavy metal fans, it showed Slade&#x27;s heavier rock sound. The single hit the number 10 spot in the UK, becoming Slade&#x27;s first top ten hit since 1976. In March, an album consisting of four new tracks and six tracks from the previous album &quot;Return to Base&quot; was released. Also called &quot;We&#x27;ll Bring the House Down&quot; it peaked at number 25.

&quot;Wheels Ain&#x27;t Coming Down&quot;, which originally appeared as the opening track on the album &quot;Return to Base&quot;, was released in March 1981 and reached number 60 in the UK. Although not a hit, it served to keep Slade in the public eye while they were writing new material and planning a European tour. Slade&#x27;s success at the 1980 Reading festival was helping them fill large venues and led to their being asked about a return in 1981. The band refused to return so soon, and opted to play the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington.

In May, the band released &quot;Knuckle Sandwich Nancy&quot; which featured lyrics commenting on the assault on Holder in the Welsh nightclub. Although eagerly wanted as a single by the band, Chandler was not entirely convinced and thus it was half-heartedly released and failed to chart. The band blamed Chandler for losing interest, and began to manage themselves. Chandler sold his share of Cheapskate Records and negotiated a favourable deal for the band with RCA Records. The new deal meant that Slade&#x27;s records would get worldwide release except in the US and Canada. The next couple of UK singles were still released under the Cheapskate label but with RCA pressing and distributing the records, then a full RCA release could start.

The band&#x27;s first full release on the RCA label was the European hit single &quot;Lock Up Your Daughters&quot; in late 1981. The track continued to follow a more heavy metal sound and made number 29 in the UK. The album &quot;Till Deaf Do Us Part&quot; followed in November 1981 and peaked at number 68. It remains Slade&#x27;s most metal-directed and heaviest sounding album to date. An article in &quot;NME&quot; shortly after release claimed Slade were in trouble over the album cover, which featured an &#x27;offensive&#x27; picture of a nail piercing an ear drum, and that many dealers were refusing to stock it. The cover was later changed on the CD reissue to a picture of the band in flames. In December, RCA released &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; for the first time since its initial outing. This time, however, it only managed to get to number 32.

By early 1982, the band had released a new single from the &quot;Till Deaf Do Us Part&quot; album, &quot;Ruby Red&quot;. Although a gatefold release with two extra live tracks, it only managed to reach 51 in the UK chart. The opening track from the album, &quot;Rock and Roll Preacher&quot; was released exclusively in Germany in April. The first Slade single to have a 12&quot; single version, it peaked at number 49. The song also became Slade&#x27;s new show opener. In November, the band released a new single, &quot;(And Now the Waltz) C&#x27;est La Vie&quot;, which was aimed directly at the Christmas market. It only made number 50 in the UK but was a hit in Poland where it reached number two. The band&#x27;s version of the party track &quot;Okey Cokey&quot; was also re-released that year but failed to make an impact, much like the original release in 1979. Lastly, &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; was again re-released, this time only managing to get to number 67. December saw the release of Slade&#x27;s third and final live album, &quot;Slade on Stage&quot;, which peaked at number 58 in the UK but received a positive response from critics. Lea continued working on solo projects throughout despite the upturn in Slade&#x27;s fortunes.

===American breakthrough (1983–1984)===
Although Slade enjoyed some minor success, RCA Records had higher expectations and sent them away to write songs to be considered for release in 1983. The band came back with two possible singles, &quot;My Oh My&quot; and &quot;Run Runaway&quot;. A raw demo of Holder singing &quot;My Oh My&quot; over Lea&#x27;s piano was received with particular enthusiasm by RCA. The label was delighted with both the tracks and hired outside producer John Punter to work with the band to record them. This was the first time the band had another producer since Chandler. Punter&#x27;s methods differed from those Slade were used to, in that the band recorded all their parts separately. This method eventually met with the band&#x27;s approval, except for Holder, who believed this method was ruining their unique chemistry and was losing their rock and roll edge. The power ballad &quot;My Oh My&quot; was released in November 1983, where it slowly climbed the charts and by December, Slade found themselves competing for the Christmas number 1 spot. The single peaked at number 2 behind a cappella group The Flying Pickets with their cover of Yazoo&#x27;s &quot;Only You&quot;. The single was a success across Europe and topped the charts in Norway and Sweden. &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot;, again re-released, made number 20 that year.

The album &quot;The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome&quot;, co-produced by Lea and Punter, was also released in December but, despite the strength of &quot;My Oh My&quot;, had only made number 74 by the end of the year. To try to push the album further up the charts, January 1984 saw the release of &quot;Run Runaway&quot;, a Celtic-flavoured rock jig featuring the return of Lea&#x27;s fiddle. The single peaked at number seven in the UK and was also successful in a number of other European countries. The tactic of releasing a second single appeared to work and &quot;The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome&quot; eventually reached number 49 in the UK. The album was far more successful in Sweden and Norway, where it peaked at number 1 and number 2 respectively. By the end of 1983, the band had finished what would prove to be their final UK tour.

In late 1983, Holder joined Lea in record production producing, among other things, Girlschool&#x27;s cover of the T-Rex song &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; and the album &quot;Play Dirty&quot; which featured two Slade tracks, &quot;Burning in the Heat of Love&quot; and &quot;High and Dry&quot;. Toward the end of the year, American glam metal band Quiet Riot released a cover version of &quot;Cum on Feel the Noize&quot; on Pasha Records and distributed by Columbia Records. It became a hit, peaking at number five in the Billboard 100, and helping their debut album &quot;Metal Health&quot; to the top, selling seven million copies on the way. As a result, Slade&#x27;s original was re-released in the UK but only reached number 98. However, the success of a Slade track in the US charts prompted CBS Records to sign Slade to their CBS Associated label and in mid-1984, released the single &quot;Run Runaway&quot;. The single eventually peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a total of 17 weeks, and topped the American mainstream rock chart. It was Slade&#x27;s first and only top 20 hit in the States. Its success, it has been suggested, was partly due to the accompanying music video which was filmed at Eastnor Castle in Ledbury, Herefordshire, England and was heavily shown on the MTV music channel. In August 1984, &quot;My Oh My&quot; was released in the US as a follow-up; it peaked at number 37 for a total of 11 weeks, again with the help of a heavily rotated music video on MTV. Quiet Riot meanwhile released another Slade song, &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot;, which peaked at number 51.

&quot;The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome&quot; was reworked with a couple of alternative tracks and different artwork, and was released in North America as &quot;Keep Your Hands Off My Power Supply&quot;. The album was a success, getting to number 33 in the US and number 26 in Canada. The final single from the album was &quot;Slam the Hammer Down&quot; which peaked at number 92. A tour with Ozzy Osbourne was cancelled after several warm-up gigs, when Lea collapsed in the dressing room after a performance. He was later diagnosed with hepatitis C. The band returned to the UK and did not tour again, mainly due to differences within the band and problems in Holder&#x27;s family life.

===Second decline in popularity (1985–1990)===
In mid-1984, Polydor released a new compilation, &quot;Slade&#x27;s Greats&quot;, which peaked at number 89, and during the autumn a full European tour was announced to promote the album. Tickets were being sold before the band had agreed that the tour would actually take place: shortly afterwards, it was cancelled because Holder, who was facing a divorce from his first wife, was furious arrangements for the tour had gone ahead without his agreement. In late 1984, a new single, similar in style to &quot;My Oh My&quot; was released in the UK. Entitled &quot;All Join Hands&quot;, the song made number 15 in the chart. &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; was also re-released, peaking at number 47 in the UK.

At the beginning of 1985, Slade released the single &quot;7 Year Bitch&quot; which stalled at number 60 in the UK when it failed to make radio playlists. The band protested that there had been no reaction to Elton John&#x27;s &quot;The Bitch Is Back&quot; which was a hit record. The single did make number 39 in the German chart. A following single was released in March entitled &quot;Myzsterious Mizster Jones&quot;. The single marked a return for Slade&#x27;s trademark of spelling titles incorrectly, which had not been done since the 1973 hit &quot;Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me&quot;. Despite being a radio-friendly track, the single only peaked at number 50 in the UK Neither &quot;7 Year Bitch&quot; nor &quot;Myzsterious Mizster Jones&quot; was released in America but the single &quot;Little Sheila&quot; was, where it reached number 86 in the Billboard chart and number 13 in the American mainstream rock chart. It was also released in Canada, where it got to number 50, and Germany.

&quot;Rogues Gallery&quot;, an album heavily reliant on Lea playing on synthesizer and the majority of instruments, was released in the UK during March, and in America during May. Reported to be one of the band&#x27;s most polished productions, the band aimed to produce an album where all tracks were potential hit singles. Despite receiving critical acclaim in both Europe and America, the album failed to live up to commercial expectations, partly due to the lack of live appearances, and Slade were unable to retain their new-found American audience or rekindled British following, causing the band to largely fade from sight once more. In the UK, the album reached number 60, whilst in America it made number 132. The album was a hit in Norway, peaking at number 5. It also charted in other European countries.

In November, the band released a party album called &quot;Crackers – The Christmas Party Album&quot; which peaked at number 34 and was certified UK gold sales later that month. Repackaged on several occasions under various names such as &quot;The Party Album&quot; and &quot;Slade&#x27;s Crazee Christmas&quot;; it contained Slade hits and songs that had been successful for other artists. Amazed at what Bob Geldof had achieved with Live Aid, Holder penned the lyrics to &quot;Do You Believe in Miracles&quot; which was also released in November. The single&#x27;s earnings went to charity but it only peaked at number 54 in the UK. The final release of the year was another re-release of &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; which peaked at number 48 in the UK.

In 1986, two new Slade tracks, &quot;We Won&#x27;t Give In&quot; and &quot;Wild Wild Party&quot;, were used for the British film, &quot;Knights &amp; Emeralds&quot;. That same year, the rock band The Redbeards From Texas released a cover of the 1972 Slade hit, &quot;Gudbuy T&#x27;Jane&quot; and in late 1986; &quot;Okey Cokey&quot; was re-released for the second time but failed to chart, whilst &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; was once again re-released, peaking at number 71. 1986 also saw Slade&#x27;s first official fan convention at the Finsbury Leisure Centre, Old Street, London.

To avoid becoming a &#x27;Christmas&#x27; hit band, Slade did not release the single &quot;Still the Same&quot; in December 1986 but left it until February 1987. The single was not a major hit, reaching number 73 in the UK, leaving RCA wondering whether it might have been a better idea to release it at Christmas. Released in April, &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; suffered a similar fate, peaking at number 95. Slade&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;You Boyz Make Big Noize&quot;, was released a week later. It was produced by Roy Thomas Baker, Lea and Punter. The album was poorly promoted with no accompanying tour or music videos and spent just one week in the UK chart, peaking at number 98. Like much of Slade&#x27;s later material, it fared better in Norway where it got to number 12.

Following the album&#x27;s failure, RCA agreed to let Slade return to their own Cheapskate Records label, although RCA still continued distributing. A new single, also called &quot;You Boyz Make Big Noize&quot; was released in August. Influenced by the Beastie Boys&#x27; musical style, it lacked the synthesiser sound of the album. It was another commercial failure, just creeping into the top 100 at number 94. The single did not feature on the European version of the album but became the title track for the American version which was also released in August. The album was not successful in America, neither was the single &quot;Ooh La La in L.A.&quot; despite receiving radio play in Los Angeles. In late 1987, &quot;We Won&#x27;t Give In&quot; was released as a single in the UK, where it peaked at No. 121. The band&#x27;s 1987 official fan convention was held at The Royal Standard Convention, Walthamstow, London.

In 1988, Slade released a cover of the Chris Montez song &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;; a re-mix of the track from &quot;Crackers – The Christmas Party Album&quot;. The band held their third official fan club convention at Drummonds Convention, King&#x27;s Cross, London. In late 1989, after what was initially supposed to be an 18-month break, Holder announced plans for a new album. Due to be released in 1990, the album never materialised, nor did the tour that would have followed had the album been a success. 1989 saw &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; make another new chart appearance, this time reaching number 99 the week after &quot;Let&#x27;s Party&quot; by Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers, which sampled the song, topped the chart.

In 1989, Hill formed his own group, Blessings in Disguise, with ex-Wizzard keyboard player Bill Hunt, Craig Fenney and Bob Lamb. During 1990, Lea released his own version of Slade&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;ll Bring the House Down&quot; under the name The Clout. At the end of the year, &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; was again re-released and peaked at number 93.

In late 1990, both Holder and Lea produced a cover of &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; by the band The Metal Gurus, known mainly as The Mission. The single peaked at number 55 in the UK and both Holder and Lea appeared in the song&#x27;s music video, whilst Holder provided lead vocals on one of the single&#x27;s b-sides, another Slade cover, &quot;Gudbuy T&#x27;Jane&quot;. All artist royalties from the sale of the single were donated to Childline.

===Brief comeback and break-up (1991–1992)===
In April 1991, the Slade fan club-organised a 25th anniversary party. The band, who were invited, played one song, Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; which turned out to be their last live performance. In that same year, Lea produced the single &quot;Where Have All the Good Girls Gone&quot; for the Crybabys, which was not a success. Later, Polydor Records contacted Slade about a new compilation album. It was hoped that Slade would promote it by releasing two brand new singles and, if successful, would record a new studio album. The first single, &quot;Radio Wall of Sound&quot;, written by Lea and originally intended for a solo project, was released in October. The compilation album, &quot;Wall of Hits&quot; was released the following month, along with a video compilation under the same name. Both the single and the album were moderately successful reaching number 21 and number 34 respectively. The album later went certified UK silver and in an attempt to promote it further, a second single, &quot;Universe&quot; was released in December. Despite a number of TV performances, the single failed to reach the top 100 of the UK Singles Chart. As a result, in January 1992, Polydor withdrew the option for a new album and future singles.

In March 1992, the band returned to Rich Bitch Studios to record a new house/dance-style version of &quot;We&#x27;ll Bring the House Down&quot;. However, by the end of the month, Holder had decided to finally leave the band. He had become weary of the constant arguing and discontent within the band, and effectively managing their day-to-day affairs. He left after 26 years with the band to explore other career paths. Lea briefly considered Slade continuing with a new singer and thought about approaching Ian Hunter, but ultimately chose to retire from the band as well. Powell filled the gap by helping out in a hotel his partner managed, but would soon re-join Hill to form Slade II later in the year.

===Aftermath and recent years (1993–present)===

Slade II was formed in 1992 by Hill with Powell and three other musicians - Craig Fenney (bass), Steve Makin (guitar) and Steve Whalley (lead vocals and guitar). The suggestion to call the group Slade II came from Holder, but Lea was not happy with the Slade name being used at all. The group&#x27;s name was only shortened to Slade again ten years later. Working solidly on the UK theatre circuit during the winter months and throughout Europe the rest of the year, the band released one studio album in 1994 entitled &quot;Keep on Rockin&#x27;&quot;, which featured Steve Whalley on vocals. The album was not successful, nor were the singles &quot;Hot Luv&quot; and &quot;Black and White World&quot;. The band have seen many line-ups (including Dave Glover on bass, plus present incumbents Mal McNulty on guitar and vocals and John Berry on bass and vocals) but Hill and Powell have remained constant throughout.

Slade were reunited for two events during 1996: the funeral of long-time Slade manager Chas Chandler and an episode of the television show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; which featured Holder as the subject. Also in 1996, a compilation entitled &quot;The Genesis of Slade&quot; was released, which contained rare and some previously unreleased material from The Vendors, Steve Brett &amp; The Mavericks and The &#x27;N Betweens. During 1997, a new Slade compilation, &quot;Feel the Noize – Greatest Hits&quot;, reached number 19 in the UK, while in the following year, a remix of &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot;, released under the name Slade Vs. Flush, made number 30.

In 1999, BBC One broadcast a newly made documentary on the band, titled &quot;It&#x27;s Slade&quot;, which featured new interviews with all four members of the band, along with various other musical artists and celebrities such as Ozzy Osbourne, Noel Gallagher, Status Quo, Toyah Wilcox and Suzi Quatro. It was narrated by Radio One&#x27;s Mark Radcliffe. In 2000, Holder was appointed as a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his services to music and his voice was famously recorded for lift announcements at the Walsall New Art Gallery.

In 2002, Slade II shortened their name to Slade and re-released their album &quot;Keep on Rockin&#x27; &quot; with a handful of new tracks included, retitled &quot;Cum on Let&#x27;s Party&quot;. The band also released two new singles, titled &quot;Some Exercise&quot; and &quot;Take Me Home&quot;. Both singles were released in Belgium through Virgin Records. In 2003, incarcerated serial killer Rosemary West announced her supposed engagement to bassist Dave Glover. The supposed engagement was called off shortly afterwards and Glover was summarily fired from Slade by Dave Hill. Glover admitted having written to her about the case, but denied any romantic involvement. An American compilation was released by Shout! Factory in 2004, titled &quot;Get Yer Boots On: The Best of Slade&quot;.

In 2005, Steve Whalley, original singer for Slade II, left the band and was replaced by Mal McNulty, who has sung for the band since. In November 2005, Polydor released a new Slade compilation, &quot;The Very Best of Slade&quot;, which peaked at number 39 in the UK. A DVD was also released for the first time, featuring a collection of Slade videos and promos. From 2006 to 2007, music label Salvo remastered and released all of Slade&#x27;s catalogue, including a four-disc anthology set entitled &quot;The Slade Box (Anthology 1969–1991)&quot; and a package of all live albums in one &quot;Slade Alive! - The Live Anthology&quot;. The remastered series also included the release of a new compilation called simply &quot;B-Sides&quot;, which featured all of the band&#x27;s B-sides. Shout! Factory also released the compilation &quot;In for a Penny: Raves &amp; Faves&quot; in 2007.

In late 2006, UK chart rules changed to allow downloads of old singles eligible to chart, which allowed &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody&quot; to return to the chart. It has re-entered the UK Top 75 every Christmas since then, most successfully in 2007 when it peaked at number 20 and in 2018 when it peaked at number 16. In 2009, a new compilation was released, &quot;Live at the BBC&quot;. It featured songs recorded for BBC sessions between 1969 and 1972, Radio 1 jingles recorded in 1973 and 1974, and, on the second disc, songs recorded live at the Paris Theatre, London, in August 1972. In November 2009, Universal Music released a new compilation entitled &quot;Merry Xmas Everybody: Party Hits&quot;, which peaked at number 151 in the UK. In 2010, all four original members of Slade attended a business meeting hoping that maybe this could lead to the band reuniting for a farewell tour. However, the meeting soon dissolved into the same continued arguments on matters spanning back to the band&#x27;s original break-up, and led to such an idea being dismissed. Holder said in 2015: “It really saddens me that the four guys who were in Slade can’t get together and sit round the dinner table. Five years ago I got the four of us together so we could air our grievances face to face, but it was so painful I’d never want to repeat it. I was shocked.”

In 2011, Salvo released a remastered version of &quot;Sladest&quot; which included a previously unreleased studio version of the live track &quot;Hear Me Calling&quot;. On the evening of 21 December 2012, BBC Four held Slade Night, which consisted of a showing of the 1999 documentary &quot;It&#x27;s Slade&quot;, Slade at the BBC, and the band&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Slade in Flame&quot; respectively. &quot;Slade at the BBC&quot; is a compilation of the band&#x27;s performances from the BBC archives throughout their career from 1969 to 1991, introduced by Noddy Holder. According to BARB, the viewing figure for &quot;It&#x27;s Slade&quot; was 608,000 whilst &quot;Slade at the BBC&quot; had a total of 477,000 viewers.

After years of working with Lise Lyng Falkenberg, since 2006, Powell&#x27;s biography &quot;Look Wot I Dun – My Life in Slade&quot; was released on 14 October 2013, by Omnibus Press (Music Sales Ltd). The book is based on more than 50 hours of interviews with Powell as well as his own 20 years of diaries and notebooks he kept due to his problems with short-term memory following his 1973 accident. Additionally the book featured contributions and quotes from interviews of 28 of Powell&#x27;s friends, colleagues and family members. It looks in detail at Slade&#x27;s long career and Powell&#x27;s life, which included booze-ups with Ozzy Osbourne. To promote the book, Powell appeared at a number of Waterstones book signings, as well as a charity &quot;Tea with Don Powell&quot; event, a question and answer session, where Powell discussed his life with Clive Eakin of BBC Coventry &amp; Warwick. It was in support of the National Autistic Society. In 2015, the box set &quot;When Slade Rocked the World&quot; was released.

On 3 February 2020, Powell announced on his official website that Hill had sent him a &quot;cold email&quot; informing him that his services were no longer required. Hill disputes this version of events, stating that Don Powell&#x27;s version of the circumstances of the break-up were inaccurate. Powell also announced that he would be forming &quot;Don Powell&#x27;s Slade&quot; with former Slade II bassist Craig Fenney. Powell was replaced by Alex Bines. Powell&#x27;s statement was removed from his website shortly afterwards.

During 2020 and 2021, Powell, Holder and Lea conducted an extensive series of Zoom video interviews for the www.slayed.co.uk website and its forum at www.sladeforum.co.uk - comments from which were mined for the expanded second edition of the book on their unauthorised discography, &quot;THE NOIZE&quot;.

In late 2022, Lea and Powell reunited in the recording studio (with Johnny Howells and Mick Marson of the pre-Slade group The &#x27;N Betweens) to record a number of songs for a Lea project. The only track that has been released so far was the very limited edition CD single of &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot;, on the Noize Recordings label. A video was made for the song. &quot;The Train Kept A Rollin&#x27;&quot; reached number 3 on the Heritage Chart on 14 May 2023.

==Musical style==

Many Slade songs were written specifically for audience participation, such as &quot;Get Down and Get With It&quot;, &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot;, &quot;Cum on Feel the Noize&quot;, &quot;Give Us a Goal&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ll Bring The House Down&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Preacher&quot; and &quot;My Oh My&quot;. In the days before Slade, Holder, Lea, Hill and Powell were influenced by American blues artists such as Sonny Boy Williamson II, John Lee Hooker and Howlin&#x27; Wolf but then became interested in the work of Little Richard. Later they were to draw artistic influence from contemporary rock acts including the Beatles, Chuck Berry, Joe Brown, Cream, the Kinks, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, the Rolling Stones, Rufus Thomas, the Who, the Pretty Things, and Screaming Lord Sutch. Chas Chandler&#x27;s connections with The Animals and Jimi Hendrix also had an influence.

The 1969 album &quot;Beginnings&quot;, released under the name Ambrose Slade, featured many songs that basically comprised their live act with covers of psychedelic rock and classic 1960s rocksongs by Steppenwolf, Ted Nugent, Frank Zappa, The Moody Blues, The Beatles and Marvin Gaye.

&quot;Play It Loud&quot; (1970), the first album that was released as Slade, showed more of a progressive rock sound.

Their 1972 live album, &quot;Slade Alive!&quot;, featured cover versions of songs by Ten Years After, The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, Bobby Marchan and Steppenwolf and is considered a strong classic rock effort. Their sound was toughening up and they would soon find their classic sound and commence the tremendously successful Holder / Lea songwriting partnership.

The 1971 single &quot;Coz I Luv You&quot;, and the 1973 B-side Kill &#x27;Em At The Hot Club Tonite were inspired by the gypsy swing of the Quintette du Hot Club de France, especially the guitar and violin styles of Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli.

&quot;Slayed?&quot; (1972) merged glam rock with classic rock, and whilst the 1974 album, &quot;Old New Borrowed and Blue&quot;, continued in this vein, it also featured pop-rock, rock ballads and novelty tracks. The next album was the 1974 soundtrack &quot;Slade in Flame&quot; which saw a return to 1960s classic rock, to fit with the theme of the film. The single from the album, &quot;Far Far Away&quot; had an acoustic rock sound, whereas the following single &quot;How Does It Feel?&quot; featured the use of brass and woodwind instruments.

In 1975, while residing in the States, Slade was influenced by Southern boogie rock bands and as a result, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fools&quot; featured a wide mixture of styles including soul, country, rock, funk, folk and blues. The album also featured some soulful female backing vocalists. After the band returned to the UK in 1977, they began to merge their American influences with a classic, hard rock. &quot;Return to Base&quot; (1979) featured elements of classic rock, acoustic rock, rock ballads, ambient rock and rock and roll. Two albums, released in 1981; &quot;We&#x27;ll Bring the House Down&quot; and &quot;Till Deaf Do Us Part&quot; adopted a hard rock and heavy metal sound, as a result of the band&#x27;s revival amongst heavy metal fans, following their success at the Reading Festival.

The 1983 album &quot;The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome&quot; featured a change in musical direction, with a more commercial-friendly rock sound on some tracks, mixed with hard rock and glam metal influences. Some of the tracks hinted at a motor racing theme. One single from the album, &quot;My Oh My&quot; followed a power ballad sound, whilst the next single, &quot;Run Runaway&quot; was reminiscent of a Scottish jig. Slade&#x27;s next album, &quot;Rogues Gallery&quot; featured a strong use of synthesisers, which were a popular instrument in the latter half of the 1980s as did the band&#x27;s final album &quot;You Boyz Make Big Noize&quot;, although this album had a slightly grittier hard rock sound.

==Legacy and influence==

Slade have influenced numerous artists including: Nirvana, the Smashing Pumpkins, the Ramones, Sex Pistols, the Clash, Kiss, Mötley Crüe, Quiet Riot, Poison, Def Leppard, Cheap Trick, Twisted Sister, the Undertones, the Replacements and the Runaways. Other artists include Hanoi Rocks, Queen, Kirka, Hot Leg, Candlebox, Cock Sparrer and Girlschool. Their anarchic attitude was adopted by the Damned, the Wonder Stuff, and Oasis, the latter of whom covered &quot;Cum on Feel the Noize&quot;. Comedians Vic Reeves, Bob Mortimer, Paul Whitehouse and Mark Williams affectionately parodied the band in a number of what the band called &#x27;hysterically accurate&#x27; &quot;Slade in Residence&quot; and &quot;Slade on Holiday&quot; sketches, in their &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot; television programme in the early 1990s.

Joey Ramone stated &quot;I spent most of the early 70s listening to &quot;Slade Alive!&quot; thinking to myself, &quot;Wow – this is what I want to do. I want to make that kind of intensity for myself. A couple of years later I was at CBGB&#x27;s doing my best Noddy Holder.&quot; Steve Jones of Sex Pistols stated &quot;Slade never compromised. We always had the feeling that they were on our side. I don&#x27;t know but I think we were right.&quot; NME commented on Slade&#x27;s legacy in a review of a greatest hits album, &quot;They embodied the glorious absurdity of the greatest pop, in the sideburns, the mirrored top hat and Dave Hill&#x27;s pudding bowl haircut. As such they were the simplest, most effective possible, riposte to prog rock&#x27;s bloated pretensions and pseudo-intellect.&quot; In 1981, Adam and the Ants&#x27; lead guitarist and co-songwriter Marco Pirroni, who now owns Dave Hill&#x27;s original trademark &#x27;Superyob&#x27; guitar, stated that he was greatly influenced by the first gig he ever attended which was Slade at Wembley Pool in 1973.

TV presenter Gareth Jones, also known as Gaz Top, is a known Slade fan who hosted the 1986 Slade documentary &quot;Slade Perseverance&quot;. Jones also appeared at the 1986 and 1987 official Slade fan club conventions. Other famous Slade fans include English ex-football player Gary Lineker and Welsh football player Nigel Vaughan, whom Lea and Hill visited on Boxing Day 1989 at the football ground of Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Ozzy Osbourne commented during a Slade documentary, &quot;Noddy Holder&#x27;s got one of greatest voices in rock ever.&quot; On his show, &#x27;Breakfast With Alice&#x27; on Planet Rock, Alice Cooper stated &quot;I love Slade. One of the oddest-looking bands of all time... Twisted Sister lived on Slade, and so did Quiet Riot pretty much. They wrote the catchiest songs around.&quot; In 2008, Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe said, &#x27;&quot;...like with Alice Cooper and Bowie and Slade – those fucking bands gave 150 percent. It was about fashion, it was about music, it was about pushing the envelope&quot;. Status Quo bassist John &quot;Rhino&quot; Edwards stated in a 2010 interview, &quot;I thought the best violin player was Jimmy Lea out of Slade. Oh, he&#x27;s just brilliant. He&#x27;s a brilliant musician, that guy. He&#x27;s a serious bass player. That band (Slade) are so underrated as players. So original.&quot; Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore said of them, &quot;They are a good group because they don&#x27;t care about the notes and there is a public wanting that. Another group might be too inhibited to do what they do.&quot;

Twisted Sister vocalist Dee Snider once described Twisted Sister as Slade meets the Sex Pistols. Twisted Sister&#x27;s guitarist Jay Jay French stated &quot;I would say our direct lineage these days is a bit of Slade and Alice Cooper.&quot; On the 2011 final &quot;Mark Radcliffe &amp; Stuart Maconie&quot; BBC Radio Two show, Manic Street Preachers bassist Nicky Wire stated that he believed Slade&#x27;s post-Reading material was very underrated.

Kiss bassist Gene Simmons stated that his band&#x27;s early songwriting ethos and stage performance was influenced by Slade. In his book &quot;Kiss and Make-Up&quot;, Simmons wrote &quot;... we liked the way they (Slade) connected with the crowd and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity&quot;. Tom Petersson of Cheap Trick said that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they (Slade) used &quot;every cheap trick in the book&quot;, thus inadvertently coining his group&#x27;s name. Cheap Trick covered the song &quot;When the Lights Are Out&quot; on their 2009 release, &quot;The Latest&quot;.
Quiet Riot had US hits with covers of &quot;Cum on Feel the Noize&quot; and &quot;Mama Weer All Crazee Now&quot;. The origins of Slade&#x27;s influence on Quiet Riot date back to the early 1970s, when Kevin DuBrow photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearance at the Whisky a Go Go. However, Quiet Riot drummer Frankie Banali claims that DuBrow was not a fan of Slade, favouring fellow British rock bands Queen and Humble Pie.

In 1971, &quot;Record Mirror&quot; magazine voted Slade number 10 in the top UK groups based on singles for the year. During 1972, the then popular teen magazine, &quot;Fab 208&quot;, voted the band &quot;Group of the Year&quot; whilst in the &quot;Record Mirror&quot; magazine that same year; Slade were voted number two in the most promising British groups list, number five in the top 18 groups list and number 17 in the male groups category. Also in 1972, Slade were voted number one top band and leading recording act in the NME magazine chart points survey, and number one top live band. Radio Luxembourg presented Slade with the award for &quot;Britain&#x27;s act/group of the year&quot; in 1973.

In February 1973, Slade were voted Best Live Band by the Disc Music Awards. The same year, the band were again voted the world&#x27;s top group in the NME Poll and top group in the BBC World Service Poll. In April 1973, Record Mirror magazine ranked Slade at number three of top 10 in both the album and singles band chart. Record Mirror&#x27;s exclusive chart survey was based on a point system allocated according to position and length of time in UK charts for the first three months of the year. In July 1973, Record Mirror magazine ranked Slade at number six of 10 in the UK group singles chart and number 3 in the UK group albums chart. In 1973 and 1974, the band received the Carl-Alan award for Top Group.

In early 1974, the band were voted the number one foreign group by Spain&#x27;s biggest music magazine of the time and were voted best overseas group in Finland, Belgium and Ireland. The Disc Music Awards rated Slade as the best live group and top British group. Slade made number four in the &quot;top groups in the world&quot; category. Individual members were also acknowledged; Noddy Holder was number five in the best British male singers whilst Jim Lea made number nine in the top songwriter list. In the &quot;Record and Radio Mirror&quot; poll results of 1974, Slade were voted top British group, with Holder number two in the top British male singer list. Dave Hill and Jim Lea made the top British guitarist list at number one and seven respectively. Lea also appeared at number nine in the top British keyboardist list and number two in the miscellaneous instruments list. Don Powell was voted top British percussionist. The band collected the 1974 Belgian award for Best World Group.

In February 1976, Record Mirror magazine voted Slade the third best UK group with Noddy Holder number eight in the best male singer and number six in the best songwriter categories. In 1980, Record Mirror voted the band number one for the most inspired comeback of the year.

<text>are an East Asian ethnic group native to the Japanese archipelago. Japanese people constitute 97.4% of the population of the country of Japan. Worldwide, approximately 125 million people are of Japanese descent, making them one of the largest ethnic groups. Approximately 120.8 million Japanese people are residents of Japan, and there are approximately 4 million members of the Japanese diaspora, known as .

In some contexts, the term &quot;Japanese people&quot; may be used to refer specifically to the Yamato people, who are primarily from the historically principal islands of Honshū, Kyūshū and Shikoku and constitute by far the largest group. In other contexts, the term may include other groups native to the Japanese archipelago, including Ryukyuan people, who share connections with the Yamato but are often regarded as distinct, and Ainu people. In recent decades, there has also been an increase in the number of people with both Japanese and non-Japanese roots, including half Japanese people.

==History==
===Theories of origins===

Archaeological evidence indicates that Stone Age people lived in the Japanese archipelago during the Paleolithic period between 39,000 and 21,000 years ago. Japan was then connected to mainland Asia by at least one land bridge, and nomadic hunter-gatherers crossed to Japan. Flint tools and bony implements of this era have been excavated in Japan.

In the 18th century, Arai Hakuseki suggested that the ancient stone tools in Japan were left behind by the Shukushin. Later, Philipp Franz von Siebold argued that the Ainu people were indigenous to northern Japan. Iha Fuyū suggested that Japanese and Ryukyuan people have the same ethnic origin, based on his 1906 research on the Ryukyuan languages. In the Taishō period, Torii Ryūzō claimed that Yamato people used Yayoi pottery and Ainu used Jōmon pottery.

After World War II, Kotondo Hasebe and Hisashi Suzuki claimed that the origin of Japanese people was not newcomers in the Yayoi period (300 BCE – 300 CE) but the people in the Jōmon period. However, Kazuro Hanihara announced a new racial admixture theory in 1984 and a &quot;dual structure model&quot; in 1991. According to Hanihara, modern Japanese lineages began with Jōmon people, who moved into the Japanese archipelago during Paleolithic times, followed by a second wave of immigration, from East Asia to Japan during the Yayoi period (300 BC). Following a population expansion in Neolithic times, these newcomers then found their way to the Japanese archipelago sometime during the Yayoi period. As a result, replacement of the hunter-gatherers was common in the island regions of Kyūshū, Shikoku, and southern Honshū, but did not prevail in the outlying Ryukyu Islands and Hokkaidō, and the Ryukyuan and Ainu people show mixed characteristics. Mark J. Hudson claims that the main ethnic image of Japanese people was biologically and linguistically formed from 400 BCE to 1,200 CE. Currently, the most well-regarded theory is that present-day Japanese people formed from both the Yayoi rice-agriculturalists and the various Jōmon period ethnicities. However, some recent studies have argued that the Jōmon people had more ethnic diversity than originally suggested or that the people of Japan bear significant genetic signatures from three ancient populations, rather than just two.

===Jōmon and Yayoi periods===

Some of the world&#x27;s oldest known pottery pieces were developed by the Jōmon people in the Upper Paleolithic period, dating back as far as 16,000 years. The name &quot;Jōmon&quot; (縄文 &quot;Jōmon&quot;) means &quot;cord-impressed pattern&quot;, and comes from the characteristic markings found on the pottery. The Jōmon people were mostly hunter-gatherers, but also practicized early agriculture, such as Azuki bean cultivation. At least one middle-to-late Jōmon site (, –1000 BC) featured a primitive rice-growing agriculture, relying primarily on fish and nuts for protein. The ethnic roots of the Jōmon period population were heterogeneous, and can be traced back to ancient Southeast Asia, the Tibetan plateau, ancient Taiwan, and Siberia.

Beginning around 300 BC, the Yayoi people originating from Northeast Asia entered the Japanese islands and displaced or intermingled with the Jōmon. The Yayoi brought wet-rice farming and advanced bronze and iron technology to Japan. The more productive paddy field systems allowed the communities to support larger populations and spread over time, in turn becoming the basis for more advanced institutions and heralding the new civilization of the succeeding Kofun period.

The estimated population of Japan in the late Jōmon period was about eight hundred thousand, compared to about three million by the Nara period. Taking the growth rates of hunting and agricultural societies into account, it is calculated that about one-and-a-half million immigrants moved to Japan in the period. According to several studies, the Yayoi created the &quot;Japanese-hierarchical society&quot;.

===Consolidation and feudal periods===

===Colonial period===

During the Japanese colonial period of 1895 to 1945, the phrase &quot;Japanese people&quot; was used to refer not only to residents of the Japanese archipelago, but also to people from colonies who held Japanese citizenship, such as Taiwanese people and Korean people. The official term used to refer to ethnic Japanese during this period was . Such linguistic distinctions facilitated forced assimilation of colonized ethnic identities into a single Imperial Japanese identity.

After the end of World War II, the Soviet Union classified many Nivkh people and Orok people from southern Sakhalin, who had been Japanese imperial subjects in Karafuto Prefecture, as Japanese people and repatriated them to Hokkaidō. On the other hand, many Sakhalin Koreans who had held Japanese citizenship until the end of the war were left stateless by the Soviet occupation.

==Language==

The Japanese language is a Japonic language that is related to the Ryukyuan languages and was treated as a language isolate in the past. The earliest attested form of the language, Old Japanese, dates to the 8th century. Japanese phonology is characterized by a relatively small number of vowel phonemes, frequent gemination and a distinctive pitch accent system. The modern Japanese language has a tripartite writing system using hiragana, katakana and kanji. The language includes native Japanese words and a large number of words derived from the Chinese language. In Japan the adult literacy rate in the Japanese language exceeds 99%. Dozens of Japanese dialects are spoken in regions of Japan. For now, Japanese is classified as a member of the Japonic languages or as a language isolate with no known living relatives if Ryukyuan is counted as dialects.

==Religion==
Japanese religion has traditionally been syncretic in nature, combining elements of Buddhism and Shinto (Shinbutsu-shūgō). Shinto, a polytheistic religion with no book of religious canon, is Japan&#x27;s native religion. Shinto was one of the traditional grounds for the right to the throne of the Japanese imperial family and was codified as the state religion in 1868 (State Shinto), but was abolished by the American occupation in 1945. Mahayana Buddhism came to Japan in the sixth century and evolved into many different sects. Today, the largest form of Buddhism among Japanese people is the Jōdo Shinshū sect founded by Shinran.

A large majority of Japanese people profess to believe in both Shinto and Buddhism. Japanese people&#x27;s religion functions mostly as a foundation for mythology, traditions and neighborhood activities, rather than as the single source of moral guidelines for one&#x27;s life.

A significant proportion of members of the Japanese diaspora practice Christianity; about 60% of Japanese Brazilians and 90% of Japanese Mexicans are Roman Catholics, while about 37% of Japanese Americans are Christians (33% Protestant and 4% Catholic).

==Literature==
Certain genres of writing originated in and are often associated with Japanese society. These include the haiku, tanka, and I Novel, although modern writers generally avoid these writing styles. Historically, many works have sought to capture or codify traditional Japanese cultural values and aesthetics. Some of the most famous of these include Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; (1021), about Heian court culture; Miyamoto Musashi&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; (1645), concerning military strategy; Matsuo Bashō&#x27;s &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; (1691), a travelogue; and Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki&#x27;s essay &quot;In Praise of Shadows&quot; (1933), which contrasts Eastern and Western cultures.

Following the opening of Japan to the West in 1854, some works of this style were written in English by natives of Japan; they include &quot;&quot; by Nitobe Inazō (1900), concerning &quot;samurai&quot; ethics, and &quot;The Book of Tea&quot; by Okakura Kakuzō (1906), which deals with the philosophical implications of the Japanese tea ceremony. Western observers have often attempted to evaluate Japanese society as well, to varying degrees of success; one of the most well-known and controversial works resulting from this is Ruth Benedict&#x27;s &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot; (1946).

Twentieth-century Japanese writers recorded changes in Japanese society through their works. Some of the most notable authors included Natsume Sōseki, Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, Osamu Dazai, Fumiko Enchi, Akiko Yosano, Yukio Mishima, and Ryōtarō Shiba. Popular contemporary authors such as Ryū Murakami, Haruki Murakami, and Banana Yoshimoto have been translated into many languages and enjoy international followings, and Yasunari Kawabata and Kenzaburō Ōe were awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Arts==
Decorative arts in Japan date back to prehistoric times. Jōmon pottery includes examples with elaborate ornamentation. In the Yayoi period, artisans produced mirrors, spears, and ceremonial bells known as &quot;dōtaku.&quot; Later burial mounds, or &quot;kofun,&quot; preserve characteristic clay figures known as &quot;haniwa,&quot; as well as wall paintings.

Beginning in the Nara period, painting, calligraphy, and sculpture flourished under strong Confucian and Buddhist influences from China. Among the architectural achievements of this period are the Hōryū-ji and the Yakushi-ji, two Buddhist temples in Nara Prefecture. After the cessation of official relations with the Tang dynasty in the ninth century, Japanese art and architecture gradually became less influenced by China. Extravagant art and clothing were commissioned by nobles to decorate their court, and although the aristocracy was quite limited in size and power, many of these pieces are still extant. After the Tōdai-ji was attacked and burned during the Genpei War, a special office of restoration was founded, and the Tōdai-ji became an important artistic center. The leading masters of the time were Unkei and Kaikei.

Painting advanced in the Muromachi period in the form of ink wash painting under the influence of Zen Buddhism as practiced by such masters as Sesshū Tōyō. Zen Buddhist tenets were also incorporated into the tea ceremony during the Sengoku period. During the Edo period, the polychrome painting screens of the Kanō school were influential thanks to their powerful patrons (including the Tokugawa clan). Popular artists created &quot;ukiyo-e&quot;, woodblock prints for sale to commoners in the flourishing cities. Pottery such as Imari ware was highly valued as far away as Europe.

In theater, Noh is a traditional, spare dramatic form that developed in tandem with kyōgen farce. In stark contrast to the restrained refinement of noh, kabuki, an &quot;explosion of color&quot;, uses every possible stage trick for dramatic effect. Plays include sensational events such as suicides, and many such works were performed both in kabuki and in bunraku puppet theater.

Since the Meiji Restoration, Japanese art has been influenced by many elements of Western culture. Contemporary decorative, practical, and performing arts works range from traditional forms to purely modern modes. Products of popular culture, including J-pop, J-rock, manga, and anime have found audiences around the world.

==Citizenship==
Article 10 of the Constitution of Japan defines the term &quot;Japanese&quot; based upon Japanese nationality (citizenship) alone, without regard for ethnicity. The Government of Japan considers all naturalized and native-born Japanese nationals with a multi-ethnic background &quot;Japanese&quot;, and in the national census the Japanese Statistics Bureau asks only about nationality, so there is no official census data on the variety of ethnic groups in Japan. While this has contributed to or reinforced the widespread belief that Japan is ethnically homogeneous, as shown in the claim of former Japanese Prime Minister Tarō Asō that Japan is a nation of &quot;one race, one civilization, one language and one culture&quot;, some scholars have argued that it is more accurate to describe the country of Japan as a multiethnic society.

Children born to international couples receive Japanese nationality when one parent is a Japanese national. However, Japanese law states that children who are dual citizens must choose one nationality before the age of 20. Studies estimate that 1 in 30 children born in Japan are born to interracial couples, and these children are sometimes referred to as &quot;hāfu&quot; (half Japanese).

==Diaspora==
The term is used to refer to Japanese people who emigrated from Japan and their descendants.

Emigration from Japan was recorded as early as the 15th century to the Philippines and Borneo, and in the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of traders from Japan also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population. However, migration of Japanese people did not become a mass phenomenon until the Meiji era, when Japanese people began to go to the United States, Brazil, Canada, the Philippines, China, and Peru. There was also significant emigration to the territories of the Empire of Japan during the colonial period, but most of these emigrants and settlers repatriated to Japan after the end of World War II in Asia.

According to the Association of Nikkei and Japanese Abroad, there are about 4.0 million &quot;Nikkeijin&quot; living in their adopted countries. The largest of these foreign communities are in the Brazilian states of São Paulo and Paraná. There are also significant cohesive Japanese communities in the Philippines, East Malaysia, Peru, the U.S. states of Hawaii, California, and Washington, and the Canadian cities of Vancouver and Toronto. Separately, the number of Japanese citizens living abroad is over one million according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<doc id="186933" wikidata="Q4865798" url="?curid=186933" title="Barts Health NHS Trust">
<text>Barts Health NHS Trust is an NHS trust based in London, England. Established in 2012, it runs five hospitals throughout the City of London and East London, and is one of the largest NHS trusts in England.

== History ==
The trust was established on 1 April 2012 following the dissolution and merger of Barts and The London NHS Trust, Newham University Hospital NHS Trust and Whipps Cross University Hospital NHS Trust.

== Hospitals ==
The trust runs five hospitals:

* Mile End Hospital in Mile End
* Newham University Hospital in Plaistow
* Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel
* St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in West Smithfield
* Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone

It also used to run the London Chest Hospital in Bethnal Green, which closed in 2015.
In 2022 the outstanding maintenance bill was £315 million, the fifth largest in the English NHS.

==Covid==
The trust took on formal legal responsibility for the operation of the NHS Nightingale Hospital London, a temporary hospital set up at ExCeL London to treat patients during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. On 11 January 2021, the Trust opened the NHS COVID-19 Vaccination Centre, Newham at the ExCeL London site. On 26 June 2021 the vaccination operation moved to a site at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, London.

== Services ==
The trust serves a population of over 2.6 million people, in an area characterised by significant diversity and health inequalities. It is one of the largest NHS trusts in England and accounts for 1.5% of hospital activity in England. It provides district general hospital services to the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest and Newham, and also specialist, or &quot;tertiary&quot;, services to a wider area, including some on a national basis. It runs the largest cardiovascular centre in the United Kingdom, the second largest cancer centre in London, and leading stroke and renal units.

In addition to its five hospitals, the trust also runs a number of other facilities, including two birthing centres and some dental and primary care services.

== Performance ==
As of March 2021, the trust holds the Requires Improvement rating from the Care Quality Commission for the quality of its services. It is rated Good for being effective, caring and well-led. It is rated Requires Improvement for being safe and responsive to people&#x27;s needs.

== Finances ==
The trust has the largest private finance initiative (PFI) scheme within the NHS in England, with a capital value of £1.149 billion, and spends £116 million on its annual repayments, amounting to around 8% of its annual income.

=== Overseas patients ===
The trust issued invoices to patients thought to be ineligible for NHS treatment totaling £10.1 million in 2018–9, but only collected £1.1 million. In 2019-20 it charged 144 women who used the maternity services (out of 14,270 babies delivered that year) but had to cancel 35 of them, presumably because they were actually found to be entitled to NHS services free-at-the-point-of-use. In 2021 it wrote off about £25 million in NHS charges to overseas patients accumulated over the previous ten years.

== Patient entertainment (hospital radio) ==
The Trust is served by the following hospital radio services:
* Bedrock Radio (a registered charity established in 2002) provide a community health (hospital radio) service across East London, South Essex and immediate surrounding areas. Bedrock Radio began serving Barts Health Trust in November 2022 when Whipps Cross Hospital Radio (WXHR) closed down.

<doc id="186935" wikidata="Q1373538" url="?curid=186935" title="Japanese diaspora">
<text>The Japanese diaspora and its individual members, known as Nikkei (, ) or as Nikkeijin (, ), comprise the Japanese emigrants from Japan (and their descendants) residing in a country outside Japan. Emigration from Japan was recorded as early as the 15th century to the Philippines, but did not become a mass phenomenon until the Meiji period (1868–1912), when Japanese emigrated to the Philippines and to the Americas. There was significant emigration to the territories of the Empire of Japan during the period of Japanese colonial expansion (1875–1945); however, most of these emigrants repatriated to Japan after the 1945 surrender of Japan ended World War II in Asia.

According to the Association of Nikkei and Japanese Abroad, about 4 million Nikkei live in their adopted countries. The largest of these foreign communities are in Brazil, the United States, the Philippines, China, Canada and Peru. Descendants of emigrants from the Meiji period still maintain recognizable communities in those countries, forming separate ethnic groups from Japanese people in Japan. The largest of these foreign communities are in the Brazilian states of São Paulo and Paraná. There are also significant cohesive Japanese communities in the Philippines, Peru and in the American state of Hawaiʻi. Nevertheless, most emigrant Japanese are largely assimilated outside of Japan.

, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported the five countries with the highest number of Japanese expatriates as the United States (418,842), China (102,066), Australia (94,942), Thailand (78,431) and Canada (74,362).

== Terminology ==
The term Nikkei, from the Japanese word , is often used to refer to Japanese people who emigrated from Japan and their descendants. These groups were historically differentiated by the terms &quot;issei&quot; (first-generation Nikkei), &quot;nisei&quot; (second-generation Nikkei), &quot;sansei&quot; (third-generation Nikkei) and &quot;yonsei&quot; (fourth-generation Nikkei). In this context emigration refers to permanent settlers, excluding transient Japanese abroad, although the term may not strictly relate to citizenship status. The Japanese government defines Nikkei people as foreign citizens with the ability to provide proof of Japanese lineage within three generations. On the other hand, in the United States and some other places where Nikkei people have developed their own communities and identities, first-generation Japanese immigrants with Japanese citizenship tend to be included if they are involved in the local community.

The Japanese American National Museum, based upon a collaborative project that involved more than 100 scholars from 10 countries, has defined Nikkei as follows: 

== Early history ==
Japanese emigration to the rest of Asia was noted as early as the 15th century to the Philippines; early Japanese settlements included those in Lingayen Gulf, Manila, the coasts of Ilocos and in the Visayas when the Philippines was under the influence of Srivijaya and Majapahit Empire. In 2009, Japanese and Filipino archaeologists, from the Sumitomo Foundation-funded Boljoon Archaeological Project conducted by the University of San Carlos with the National Museum of the Philippines, discovered ancient Japanese pottery that is believed to have been in existence since the early 1700s. The ancient Japanese pottery that was discovered there has proven that there was trading activity between Japan and Cebu Island Philippines going back to the 16th century. In the 16th century the Japanese settlement was established in Ayutthaya, Thailand and in early 17th century Japanese settlers was first recorded to stay in Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). A larger wave came in the 17th century, when red seal ships traded in Southeast Asia and Japanese Catholics fled from the religious persecution imposed by the &quot;shōguns&quot; and settled in the Philippines, among other destinations. Many of them also intermarried with the local Filipina women (including those of pure or mixed Chinese and Spanish descent), thus forming the new &quot;Japanese-Mestizo&quot; community. In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of traders from Japan also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population. In the 15th century AD, &quot;shimamono&quot; tea-jars were bought by the &quot;shōguns&quot; to Uji in Kyoto from the Philippines by merchants such as Luzon Sukezaemon which was used in the Japanese tea ceremony. In the latter half of the 16th century the Portuguese Empire purchased and sold on Japanese slaves.

From the 15th through the early 17th century, Japanese seafarers traveled to China and Southeast Asia countries, in some cases establishing early Japantowns. This activity ended in the 1640s, when the Tokugawa shogunate imposed maritime restrictions which forbade Japanese from leaving the country and from returning if they were already abroad. This policy would not be lifted for over two hundred years. Travel restrictions were eased once Japan opened diplomatic relations with Western nations. In 1867, the bakufu began issuing travel documents for overseas travel and emigration.

Before 1885, few Japanese people emigrated from Japan, in part because the Meiji government was reluctant to allow emigration, both because it lacked the political power to adequately protect Japanese emigrants and because it believed that the presence of Japanese as unskilled laborers in foreign countries would hamper its ability to revise the unequal treaties. A notable exception to this trend was a group of 153 contract laborers who immigrated—without official passports—to Hawai&#x27;i and Guam in 1868. A portion of this group stayed on after the expiration of the initial labor contract, forming the nucleus of the Nikkei community in Hawai&#x27;i. In 1885, the Meiji government began to turn to officially sponsored emigration programs to alleviate pressure from overpopulation and the effects of the Matsukata deflation in rural areas. For the next decade, the government was closely involved in the selection and pre-departure instruction of emigrants. The Japanese government was keen on keeping Japanese emigrants well-mannered while abroad in order to show the West that Japan was a dignified society, worthy of respect. By the mid-1890s, immigration companies (&quot;imin-kaisha&quot;, 移民会社), not sponsored by the government, began to dominate the process of recruiting emigrants, but government-sanctioned ideology continued to influence emigration patterns.

== Asia ==

=== Before 1945 ===
In 1898, the Dutch East Indies colonial government statistics showed 614 Japanese in the Dutch East Indies (166 men, 448 women). During the American colonial era in the Philippines, the Japanese population of Davao, most of whom first started out as laborers working in abaca plantations in Davao, were recorded in statistics as only numbering 30 in 1903, then 5,533 by 1920, then 12,469 by 1930, then later increased to 20,000 by 1941. The number of Japanese laborers working in plantations rose so high that in the early 20th century, Davao City soon became dubbed as &quot;Davaokuo&quot; (in Philippine and American media) or (in ) with a Japanese school, a Shinto shrine, and a diplomatic mission from Japan. The place that used to be &quot;Little Tokyo&quot; in Davao was Mintal. There is even a popular restaurant called &quot;The Japanese Tunnel&quot;, which includes a tunnel made by the Japanese in time of the war.

In the Philippines, Halo-halo is believed to be an indigenized version of the Japanese &quot;kakigori&quot; class of desserts, originating from pre-war Japanese migrants into the islands. &quot;Odong&quot; or of Davao Region and Visayas is inspired by Japanese udon. During the early 1900s, there was a large community of Japanese laborers in Davao, half of them Okinawans, and in this period, the Japanese manufactured &quot;odong&quot;.

There was also a significant level of emigration to the overseas territories of the Empire of Japan during the Japanese colonial period, including Korea, Taiwan, Manchuria and Karafuto. Unlike emigrants to the Americas, Japanese going to the colonies occupied a higher rather than lower social niche upon their arrival.

In 1938 about 309,000 Japanese lived in Taiwan. By the end of World War II, there were over 850,000 Japanese in Korea and more than 2 million in China, most of them farmers in Manchukuo (the Japanese had a plan to bring in 5 million Japanese settlers into Manchukuo).

Over 400,000 people lived on Karafuto (Southern Sakhalin) when the Soviet offensive began in early August 1945. Most were of Japanese or Korean descent. When Japan lost the Kuril Islands, 17,000 Japanese were expelled, most from the southern islands.
=== After 1945 ===
During and after World War II, most of these overseas Japanese repatriated to Japan. The Allied powers repatriated over 6 million Japanese nationals from colonies and battlefields throughout Asia. Only a few remained overseas, often involuntarily, as in the case of orphans in China or prisoners of war captured by the Red Army and forced to work in Siberia. During the 1950s and 1960s, an estimated 6,000 Japanese accompanied Zainichi Korean spouses repatriating to North Korea, while another 27,000 prisoners-of-war are estimated to have been sent there by the Soviet Union; see Japanese people in North Korea.

There is a community of Japanese people in Hong Kong largely made up of expatriate businessmen. Additionally, there are 19,612 Japanese expatriates in Indonesia based mostly in the cities of Jakarta and Bali.

== Americas ==

The Japanese diaspora has been unique in the absence of new emigration flows in the second half of the 20th century. However, research reports that during the post-war many Japanese migrated individually to join existing communities abroad.

===North America===
People from Japan began migrating to the U.S. and Canada in significant numbers following the political, cultural and social changes stemming from the 1868 Meiji Restoration. (see Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians)

====Canada====
In Canada, small multi-generational communities of Japanese immigrants developed and adapted to life outside Japan.

====Caribbean====
There was a small amount of Japanese settlement in the Dominican Republic between 1956 and 1961, in a program initiated by Dominican Republic leader Rafael Trujillo. Protests over the extreme hardships and broken government promises faced by the initial group of migrants set the stage for the end of state-supported labor emigration in Japan.

====Mexico==== 

Mexico received Japanese immigrants in 1897, when the first thirty five arrived in Chiapas to work on coffee farms. Immigration into Mexico died down in the following years, but was eventually spurred again in 1903 due to the acceptance of mutually recognized contracts on immigration by both countries. Immigrants coming in the first four years of these contracts worked primarily on sugar plantations, coal mines, and railroads. Japanese immigrants (particularly from the Okinawa Prefecture, including Okinawans) arrived in small numbers during the early 20th century.

====United States==== 

In the United States, particularly after the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, Japanese immigrants were sought by industrialists to replace Chinese immigrants. In the early years of the 20th century, anxiety about the rapid growth of cheap Japanese labor in California came to a head when in 1906, when the School Board of San Francisco passed a resolution barring children of Japanese heritage from attending regular public schools. President Roosevelt intervened to rescind the resolution, but only on the understanding that steps would be taken to put a stop to further Japanese immigration. In 1907, in the face of Japanese government protests, the so-called &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement&quot; between the governments of Japan and the United States ended immigration of Japanese workers (i.e., men), but permitted the immigration of spouses of Japanese immigrants already in the US. The Immigration Act of 1924 banned the immigration of all but a token few Japanese, until the Immigration Act of 1965, there was very little further Japanese immigration. But afterward, the Japanese American community increased heavily.

The majority of Japanese settled in Hawaii, where today a third of the state&#x27;s population are of Japanese descent and the rest in the West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska) and Southwestern United States (Arizona, New Mexico, and adjacent parts of Colorado, Nevada, Texas, and Utah), but other significant communities are found in the Northeast (Maine, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania) and Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin) states.

===South America===
====Argentina====

Argentina is home to about 80,000 people of Japanese descent. Most of them live in Buenos Aires and districts like Balvanera and Monserrat have many Japanese restaurants, shops and izakayas. Buenos Aires also has the largest Japanese garden outside Japan, called Jardín Japonés, located in Palermo district.

====Brazil====
Japanese Brazilians are the largest ethnic Japanese community outside Japan (numbering about 2 million, compared to about 1.5 million in the United States) and São Paulo contains the largest concentration of Japanese outside Japan. Paraná and Mato Grosso do Sul also have a large Japanese community. The first Japanese immigrants (791 people, mostly farmers) came to Brazil in 1908 on the &quot;Kasato Maru&quot; from the Japanese port of Kobe, moving to Brazil in search of better living conditions. Many of them ended up as laborers on coffee farms (for testimony of &quot;Kasato Maru&quot; travelers that continued to Argentina see :es:Café El Japonés, &quot;see also Shindo Renmei&quot;). Immigration of Japanese workers in Brazil was actually subsidized by São Paulo up until 1921, with around 40,000 Japanese emigrating to Brazil between the years of 1908 and 1925, and 150,000 pouring in during the following 16 years. The most immigrants to come in one year peaked in 1933 at 24,000, but restrictions due to ever growing anti-Japanese sentiment caused it to die down and then eventually halt at the start of World War II. Japanese immigration into Brazil actually saw continued traffic after it resumed in 1951. Around 60,000 entered the country during 1951 and 1981, with a sharp decline happening in the 1960s due to a resurgence of Japan&#x27;s domestic economy.

====Colombia====

The Japanese Colombian colony migrated between 1929 and 1935 in three waves. Their community is unique in terms of their resistance against the internal conflict occurring in Colombia during the decade of the 1950s, a period known as La Violencia.

====Peru====

Japanese Peruvians form another notable ethnic Japanese community with an estimated 6,000 Issei and 100,000 Japanese descendants (Nisei, Sansei, Yonsei), and including a former Peruvian president, Alberto Fujimori. Japanese food known as Nikkei cuisine is a rich part of Peruvian-Japanese culture, which includes the use of seaweed broth and sushi-inspired versions of ceviche. As a result of Peru&#x27;s gastronomic revolution and global gastrodiplomacy campaign, Nikkei is now recognized among international culinary networks as a cuisine that is uniquely a fusion of Japanese and Peruvian influences. This change has created revenues for Japanese-Peruvian communities in Lima and enabled Nikkei chefs to open up restaurants in other metropolitan cities around the world.

== Europe ==

In recent years, many young Japanese have been migrating from Japan to Britain to engage in cultural production and to become successful artists in London.

There are also small numbers of Japanese people in Russia some whose heritage date back to the times when both countries shared the territories of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands; some Japanese communists settled in the Soviet Union, including Mutsuo Hakamada, the brother of former Japanese Communist Party chairman Satomi Hakamada, whose daughter Irina Hakamada is a notable Russian political figure. The 2002 Russian census showed 835 people claiming Japanese ethnicity (nationality).

There is a sizable Japanese community in Düsseldorf, Germany of nearly 8,400 () Japanese nationals (not ethnics). Many of them are expatriates who stay there only for a few years.

== Oceania ==

Early Japanese immigrants were particularly prominent in Broome, Western Australia, where until the Second World War they were the largest ethnic group, who were attracted to the opportunities in pearling. Several streets of Broome have Japanese names, and the town has one of the largest Japanese cemeteries outside Japan. Other immigrants were involved in the sugar cane industry in Queensland. During the Second World War, the Japanese population was detained and later expelled at the cessation of hostilities. The Japanese population in Australia was later replenished in the 1950s by the arrival of 500 Japanese war brides, who had married AIF soldiers stationed in occupied Japan. In recent years, Japanese migration to Australia, largely consisting of younger age females, has been on the rise.

There is also a small but growing Japanese community in New Zealand, primarily in Auckland and Wellington.

In the census of December 1939, the total population of the South Seas Mandate was 129,104, of which 77,257 were Japanese. By December 1941, Saipan had a population of more than 30,000 people, including 25,000 Japanese. There are Japanese people in Palau, Guam and Northern Mariana Islands.

== Return migration to Japan ==
In the 1980s, with Japan&#x27;s growing economy facing a shortage of workers willing to do so-called three &quot;K&quot; jobs (, &quot;kitsui&quot; [difficult], , &quot;kitanai&quot; [dirty] and , &quot;kiken&quot; [dangerous]), Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Labor began to grant visas to ethnic Japanese from South America to come to Japan and work in factories. The vast majority—estimated at 300,000—were from Brazil, but there is also a large population from Peru and smaller populations from other South American countries.

As a response to the Great Recession, the Japanese government offered ¥300,000 ($3,300) for unemployed Japanese descendants from South America to return to their country of origin with the stated goal of alleviating the country&#x27;s worsening labor shortage. Another ¥200,000 ($2,200) is offered for each additional family member to leave. Emigrants who took this offer were not allowed to return to Japan with the same privileged visa with which they had entered the country. Arudou Debito, columnist for English-language newspaper &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, denounced the policy as &quot;racist&quot; as it only offered Japanese-blooded foreigners who possessed the special &quot;person of Japanese ancestry&quot; visa the option to receive money in return for repatriation to their home countries. Some commentators also accused it of being exploitative since most nikkei had been offered incentives to immigrate to Japan in 1990, were regularly reported to work 60+ hours per week, and were finally asked to return home when the Japanese became unemployed in large numbers. At the same time, return migration to Japan, along with repatriation to their home countries, has also created complex relationships with both their homeland and hostland, a condition which has been called a &quot;&#x27;squared diaspora&#x27; in which the juxtaposition of homeland and hostland itself becomes questionable, instable and fluctuating.&quot; This has also taken on new forms of circular migration as first and second generation nikkei travel back and forth between Japan and their home countries.

<text>Polykleitos () was an ancient Greek sculptor, active in the 5th century BCE. Alongside the Athenian sculptors Pheidias, Myron and Praxiteles, he is considered as one of the most important sculptors of classical antiquity. The 4th century BCE catalogue attributed to Xenocrates (the &quot;Xenocratic catalogue&quot;), which was Pliny&#x27;s guide in matters of art, ranked him between Pheidias and Myron. He is particularly known for his lost treatise, the &quot;Canon of Polykleitos&quot; (a canon of body proportions), which set out his mathematical basis of an idealised male body shape.

None of his original sculptures are known to survive, but many marble works, mostly Roman, are believed to be later copies.

==Name==

His Greek name was traditionally Latinized &quot;Polycletus&quot;, but is also transliterated &quot;Polycleitus&quot; (, Classical Greek , &quot;much-renowned&quot;) and, due to iotacism in the transition from Ancient to Modern Greek, &quot;Polyklitos&quot; or &quot;Polyclitus&quot;. He is called Sicyonius (lit. &quot;The Sicyonian&quot;, usually translated as &quot;of Sicyon&quot;) by Latin authors including Pliny the Elder and Cicero, and Ἀργεῖος (lit. &quot;The Argive&quot;, trans. &quot;of Argos&quot;) by others like Plato and Pausanias. He is sometimes called the Elder, in cases where it is necessary to distinguish him from his son, who is regarded as a major architect but a minor sculptor.

==Early life and training==
As noted above, Polykleitos is called &quot;The Sicyonian&quot; by some authors, all writing in Latin, and who modern scholars view as relying on an error of Pliny the Elder in conflating another more minor sculptor from Sikyon, a disciple of Phidias, with Polykleitos of Argos. Pausanias is adamant that they were not the same person, and that Polykleitos was from Argos, in which city state he must have received his early training, and a contemporary of Phidias (possibly also taught by Ageladas).

==Works==

Polykleitos&#x27;s figure of an Amazon for Ephesus was admired, while his colossal gold and ivory statue of Hera which stood in her temple—the Heraion of Argos—was favourably compared with the Olympian Zeus by Pheidias. He also sculpted a famous bronze male nude known as the &quot;Doryphoros&quot; (&quot;Spear Bearer&quot;), which survives in the form of numerous Roman marble copies. Further sculptures attributed to Polykleitos are the &quot;Discophoros&quot; (&quot;Discus-bearer&quot;), &quot;Diadumenos&quot; (&quot;Youth tying a headband&quot;) and a Hermes at one time placed, according to Pliny, in Lysimachia (Thrace). Polykleitos&#x27;s &quot;Astragalizontes&quot; (&quot;Boys Playing at Knuckle-bones&quot;) was claimed by the Emperor Titus and set in a place of honour in his atrium. Pliny also mentions that Polykleitos was one of the five major sculptors who competed in the fifth century B.C. to make a wounded Amazon for the temple of Artemis; marble copies associated with the competition survive.

===Diadumenos===
The statue of &quot;Diadumenos&quot;, also known as &quot;Youth Tying a Headband&quot; is one of Polykleitos&#x27;s sculptures known from many copies. The gesture of the boy tying his headband represents a victory, possibly from an athletic contest. &quot;It is a first-century A.D. Roman copy of a Greek bronze original dated around 430 B.C.&quot; Polykleitos sculpted the outline of his muscles significantly to show that he is an athlete. &quot;The thorax and pelvis of the Diadoumenos tilt in opposite directions, setting up rhythmic contrasts in the torso that create an impression of organic vitality. The position of the feet poised between standing and walking give a sense of potential movement. This rigorously calculated pose, which is found in almost all works attributed to Polykleitos, became a standard formula used in Greco-Roman and, later, western European art.&quot;

===Doryphoros===
Another statue created by Polykleitos is the &quot;Doryphoros&quot;, also called the &quot;Spear bearer&quot;. It is a typical Greek sculpture depicting the beauty of the male body. &quot;Polykleitos sought to capture the ideal proportions of the human figure in his statues and developed a set of aesthetic principles governing these proportions that was known as the Canon or &#x27;Rule&#x27;. He created the system based on mathematical ratios. &quot;Though we do not know the exact details of Polykleitos’s formula, the end result, as manifested in the Doryphoros, was the perfect expression of what the Greeks called &quot;symmetria&quot;. On this sculpture, it shows somewhat of a contrapposto pose; the body is leaning most on the right leg. The Doryphoros has an idealized body, contains less of naturalism. In his left hand, there was once a spear, but if so it has since been lost. The posture of the body shows that he is a warrior and a hero. Indeed, some have gone so far as to suggest that the figure depicted was Achilles, on his way to the Trojan War, as a similar depiction of Achilles carrying a shield is seen on a vase painted by the Achilles Painter at around the same time.

==Style==

Polykleitos, along with Phidias, created the Classical Greek style. Although none of his original works survive, literary sources identifying Roman marble copies of his work allow reconstructions to be made. Contrapposto, a pose that visualizes the shifting balance of the body as weight is placed on one leg, was a source of his fame.

The refined detail of Polykleitos&#x27;s models for casting executed in clay is revealed in a famous remark repeated in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Moralia&quot;, that &quot;the work is hardest when the clay is under the fingernail&quot;.

==The &quot;Canon of Polykleitos&quot; and &quot;symmetria&quot; ==
Polykleitos consciously created a new approach to sculpture, writing a treatise (an artistic canon () and designing a male nude exemplifying his theory of the mathematical basis of ideal proportions. Though his theoretical treatise is lost to history, he is quoted as saying, &quot;Perfection ... comes about little by little () through many numbers&quot;. By this he meant that a statue should be composed of clearly definable parts, all related to one another through a system of ideal mathematical proportions and balance. Though his Canon was probably represented by his &quot;Doryphoros&quot;, the original bronze statue has not survived, but later marble copies exist.

References to the &quot;Kanon&quot; by other ancient writers imply that its main principle was expressed by the Greek words , the Hippocratic principle of (&quot;equilibrium&quot;), and . Galen wrote that Polykleitos&#x27;s &quot;Kanon&quot; &quot;got its name because it had a precise commensurability (&quot;symmetria&quot;) of all the parts to one another.&quot; He also wrote that the &quot;Kanon&quot; defines beauty &quot;in the proportions, not of the elements, but of the parts, that is to say, of finger to finger, and of all the fingers to the palm and the wrist, and of these to the forearm, and of the forearm to the upper arm, and of all the other parts to each other.&quot;

The art historian Kenneth Clark observed that &quot;[Polykleitos&#x27;s] general aim was clarity, balance, and completeness; his sole medium of communication the naked body of an athlete, standing poised between movement and repose&quot;.

===Conjectured reconstruction===

In a 1975 paper, art historian Richard Tobin suggested that earlier work to reconstruct the Canon had failed because previous researchers had made a flawed assumption of a foundation in linear ratios rather than areal proportion. He conjectured that the Canon begins from the length of the outermost part (the &quot; phalange&quot;) of the little finger. The length of the diagonal of a square of this side (mathematically, , about 1.4142) gives the length of the middle phalange. Repeating the process gives the length of the phalange; doing so again gives the length of the metacarpal plus the carpal bones the distance from knuckle to the head of the ulna. Next, a square of side equal to the length of the hand from little finger to wrist yields a diagonal of length equal to that of the forearm. This &quot;diagonal of a square&quot; process gives the relative ratios of many other key reference distances in the human male body. The process would not require measurement of square roots: the artist could take a long cord and make knots separated from each other by a distance which equals the diagonal of the square drawn on the preceding length. On the body proper, the process is repeated but the geometric progression is taken and retaken from the top of the head (rather than additively, as on the hand/arm): the head from crown to chin is the same size as the fore-arm; from crown to clavicle is as long as the upper arm; a diagonal on that square yields the distance from the crown to the line of the nipples. Tobin validated his calculation by comparing his theoretical model with a Roman copy of &quot;Doryphoros&quot; in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples.

==Followers==

Polykleitos and Phidias were among the first generation of Greek sculptors to attract schools of followers. Polykleitos&#x27;s school lasted for at least three generations, but it seems to have been most active in the late 4th century and early 3rd century BCE. The Roman writers Pliny and Pausanias noted the names of about twenty sculptors in Polykleitos&#x27;s school, defined by their adherence to his principles of balance and definition. Skopas and Lysippus are among the best-known successors of Polykleitos, along with other, more obscure statuaries, such as Athenodoros of Cleitor and Asopodorus.

Polykleitos&#x27;s son, Polykleitos the Younger, worked in the 4th century BCE. Although the son was also a sculptor of athletes, his greatest fame was won as an architect. He designed the great theatre at Epidaurus.

<text>The Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&amp;MR) was the first inter-city railway in the world. It opened on 15 September 1830 between the Lancashire towns of Liverpool and Manchester in England. It was also the first railway to rely exclusively on locomotives driven by steam power, with no horse-drawn traffic permitted at any time; the first to be entirely double track throughout its length; the first to have a true signalling system; the first to be fully timetabled; and the first to carry mail.

Trains were hauled by company steam locomotives between the two towns, though private wagons and carriages were allowed. Cable haulage of freight trains was down the steeply-graded Wapping Tunnel to Liverpool Docks from Edge Hill junction. The railway was primarily built to provide faster transport of raw materials, finished goods, and passengers between the Port of Liverpool and the cotton mills and factories of Manchester and surrounding towns.

Designed and built by George Stephenson, the line was financially successful, and influenced the development of railways across Britain in the 1830s. In 1845 the railway was absorbed by its principal business partner, the Grand Junction Railway (GJR), which in turn amalgamated the following year with the London and Birmingham Railway and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway to form the London and North Western Railway.

== History ==

=== Background ===
During the Industrial Revolution, huge tonnages of raw material were imported through Liverpool and carried to the textile mills near the Pennines where water, and later steam power, enabled the production of the finished cloth, much of which was then transported back to Liverpool for export. The existing means of water transport, the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, the Bridgewater Canal and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, dated from the 18th century, and were felt to be making excessive profits from the cotton trade and throttling the growth of Manchester and other towns. Goods were transported between Liverpool and the factories around Manchester either by the canals or by poor-quality roads; the turnpike between Liverpool and Manchester was described as &quot;crooked and rough&quot; with an &quot;infamous&quot; surface. Road accidents were frequent, including waggons and coaches overturning, which made goods traffic problematic.

The proposed railway was intended to achieve cheap transport of raw materials, finished goods and passengers between the Port of Liverpool and east Lancashire, in the port&#x27;s hinterland. There was support for the railway from both Liverpool and London but Manchester was largely indifferent and opposition came from the canal operators and the two local landowners, the Earl of Derby and the Earl of Sefton, over whose land the railway would cross.

The proposed Liverpool and Manchester Railway was to be one of the earliest land-based public transport systems not using animal traction power. Before then, public railways had been horse-drawn, including the Lake Lock Rail Road (1796), Surrey Iron Railway (1801) and the Oystermouth Railway near Swansea (1807).

===Formation===

The original promoters are usually acknowledged to be Joseph Sandars, a rich Liverpool corn merchant, and John Kennedy, owner of the largest spinning mill in Manchester. They were influenced by William James. James was a land surveyor who had made a fortune in property speculation. He advocated a national network of railways, based on what he had seen of the development of colliery lines and locomotive technology in the north of England.

The Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company was founded on 20 May 1824. It was established by Henry Booth, who became its secretary and treasurer, along with merchants from Liverpool and Manchester. Charles Lawrence was the Chairman, Lister Ellis, Robert Gladstone, John Moss and Joseph Sandars were the Deputy Chairmen.
A bill was drafted in 1825 to Parliament, which included a 1-inch to the mile map of the railway&#x27;s route. The first bill was rejected but the second passed as the (7 Geo. 4. c. xlix) in May the following year. In Liverpool 172 people bought 1,979 shares, in London 96 took 844, Manchester 15 with 124, 24 others with 286. The Marquess of Stafford held 1,000, making 308 shareholders with 4,233 shares.

=== Survey and authorisation ===
The first survey for the line was carried out by James in 1822. The route was roughly the same as what was built, but the committee were unaware of exactly what land had been surveyed. James subsequently declared bankruptcy and was imprisoned that November. The committee lost confidence in his ability to plan and build the line and, in June 1824, George Stephenson was appointed principal engineer. As well as objections to the proposed route by Lords Sefton and Derby, Robert Haldane Bradshaw, a trustee of the Duke of Bridgewater&#x27;s estate at Worsley, refused any access to land owned by the Bridgewater Trustees and Stephenson had difficulty producing a satisfactory survey of the proposed route and accepted James&#x27; original plans with spot checks.
The survey was presented to Parliament on 8 February 1825, but was shown to be inaccurate. Francis Giles suggested that putting the railway through Chat Moss was a serious error and the total cost of the line would be around £200,000 instead of the £40,000 quoted by Stephenson. Stephenson was cross examined by the opposing counsel led by Edward Hall Alderson and his lack of suitable figures and understanding of the work came to light. When asked, he was unable to specify the levels of the track and how he calculated the cost of major structures such as the Irwell Viaduct. The bill was thrown out on 31 May.

In place of George Stephenson, the railway promoters appointed George and John Rennie as engineers, who chose Charles Blacker Vignoles as their surveyor. They set out to placate the canal interests and had the good fortune to approach the marquess directly through their counsel, W. G. Adam, who was a relative of one of the trustees, and the support of William Huskisson who knew the marquess personally. Implacable opposition to the line changed to financial support.

The second bill received royal assent as the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Act 1826 (7 Geo. 4. c. xlix) on 5 May 1826. The railway route ran on a significantly different alignment, south of Stephenson&#x27;s, avoiding properties owned by opponents of the previous bill. From Huyton the route ran directly east through Parr Moss, Newton, Chat Moss and Eccles. In Liverpool, the route included a tunnel from Edge Hill to the docks, avoiding crossing any streets at ground level. It was intended to place the Manchester terminus on the Salford side of the River Irwell, but the Mersey and Irwell Navigation withdrew their opposition to a crossing of the river at the last moment in return for access for their carts over the intended railway bridge. The Manchester station was therefore fixed at Liverpool Road in Castlefield.

=== Construction ===

The first contracts for draining Chat Moss were let in June 1826. The Rennies insisted that the company should appoint a resident engineer, recommending either Josias Jessop or Thomas Telford, but would not consider George Stephenson except in an advisory capacity for locomotive design. The board rejected their terms and re-appointed Stephenson as engineer with his assistant Joseph Locke. Stephenson clashed with Vignoles, leading to the latter resigning as resident Surveyor.

The line was long. Management was split into three sections. The western end was run by Locke, the middle section by William Allcard and the eastern section including Chat Moss, by John Dixon. The track began at the Wapping Tunnel beneath Liverpool from the south end of Liverpool Docks to Edge Hill. It was the world&#x27;s first tunnel to be bored under a metropolis. Following this was a long cutting up to deep through rock at Olive Mount, and a nine-arch viaduct, each arch of span and around high) over the Sankey Brook valley.

The railway included the crossing of Chat Moss. It was found impossible to drain the bog and so the engineers used a design from Robert Stannard, steward for William Roscoe, that used wrought iron rails supported by timber in a herring bone layout. About of spoil was dropped into the bog; at Blackpool Hole, a contractor tipped soil into the bog for three months without finding the bottom. The line was supported by empty tar barrels sealed with clay and laid end to end across the drainage ditches either side of the railway. The railway over Chat Moss was completed by the end of 1829. On 28 December, the &quot;Rocket&quot; travelled over the line carrying 40 passengers and crossed the Moss in 17 minutes, averaging . In April the following year, a test train carrying a 45-ton load crossed the moss at without incident. The line now supports locomotives 25 times the weight of the &quot;Rocket&quot;.

The railway needed 64 bridges and viaducts, all built of brick or masonry, with one exception: the Water Street bridge at the Manchester terminus. A cast iron beam girder bridge was built to save headway in the street below. It was designed by William Fairbairn and Eaton Hodgkinson, and cast locally at their factory in Ancoats. It is important because cast iron girders became an important structural material for the growing rail network. Although Fairbairn tested the girders before installation, not all were so well designed, and there were many examples of catastrophic failure in the years to come, resulting in the Dee bridge disaster of 1847 and culminating in the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879.

The line was laid using fish-belly rails at , laid either on stone blocks or, at Chat Moss, wooden sleepers.

The physical work was carried out by a large team of men, known as &quot;navvies&quot;, using hand tools. The most productive teams could move up to 20,000 tonnes of earth in a day and were well paid. Nevertheless, the work was dangerous and several deaths were recorded.

==== Cable or locomotive haulage ====


In 1829 adhesion-worked locomotives were not reliable. The experience on the Stockton and Darlington Railway was well-publicised, and a section of the Hetton colliery railway had been converted to cable haulage. The success of the cable haulage was indisputable but the steam locomotive was still untried. The had sought to de-emphasise the use of steam locomotives during the passage of the bill, the public were alarmed at the idea of monstrous machines which, if they did not explode, would fill the countryside with noxious fumes.

Attention was turning towards steam road carriages, such as those of Goldsworthy Gurney&#x27;s and there was a division in the board between those who supported Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;loco-motive&quot; and those who favoured cable haulage, the latter supported by the opinion of the engineer, John Rastrick. Stephenson was not averse to cable haulage—he continued to build such lines where he felt it appropriate—but knew its main disadvantage, that any breakdown anywhere would paralyse the whole line.

The line&#x27;s gradient was designed to concentrate the steep grades in three places, at either side of Rainhill at 1 in 96 ) and make the rest of the line very gently graded, no further than 1 in 880. When the line opened, the passenger section from Edge Hill to Crown Street railway station was cable hauled, as was the section through the Wapping Tunnel, as the act of Parliament forbade the use of locomotives on this part of the line.

To determine whether and which locomotives would be suitable, in October 1829 the directors organised a public competition, known as the Rainhill trials, which involved a run along a stretch of track. Ten locomotives were entered for the trials, but on the day of the competition only five were available to compete: &quot;Rocket&quot;, designed by George Stephenson and his son, Robert, was the only one to successfully complete the journey and, consequently, Robert Stephenson and Company were awarded the locomotive contract.

==== Double track ====
The line was built to (standard gauge) and double track. A decision had to be made about how far apart the two tracks should be. It was decided to make the space between the separate tracks the same as the track gauge itself, so that it would be possible to operate trains with unusually wide loads up the middle during quiet times. Stephenson was criticised for this decision; it was later decided that the tracks were too close together, restricting the width of the trains, so the gap between tracks (track centres) was widened. The narrowness of the gap contributed to the first fatality, that of William Huskisson, and also made it dangerous to perform maintenance on one track while trains were operating on the other. Even in the 21st century, adjacent tracks on British railways tend to be laid closer together than elsewhere.

=== Opening ===

The line opened on 15 September 1830 with termini at Manchester, Liverpool Road (now part of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester) and Liverpool Crown Street. The festivities of the opening day were marred when William Huskisson, the Member of Parliament for Liverpool, was killed. The southern line was reserved for the special opening train, drawn by the locomotive &quot;Northumbrian&quot; conveying the Duke of Wellington, the Prime Minister, in an ornamental carriage, together with distinguished guests in other carriages. When the train stopped for water at Parkside, near Newton-le-Willows, it was intended that the other trains should pass in review on the northern line. It was easy for passengers to get down and stretch their legs, despite being instructed not to, particularly as there was an interval between the delayed passing trains. Huskisson decided to alight and stroll alongside the train, and on spotting the Duke decided to start a conversation. The &quot;Rocket&quot; was spotted heading in the opposite direction as people shouted at Huskisson to get back on the train.
The Austrian ambassador was pulled back into the carriage, but Huskisson panicked. He tried to climb into the carriage, but grabbed the open door, which swung back, causing him to lose his grip. He fell between the tracks and the &quot;Rocket&quot; ran over his leg, shattering it. He is reported to have said, &quot;I have met my death—God forgive me!&quot;

The &quot;Northumbrian&quot; was detached from the Duke&#x27;s train and rushed him to Eccles, where he died in the vicarage. Thus he became the world&#x27;s first widely reported railway passenger fatality. The somewhat subdued party proceeded to Manchester, where, the Duke being deeply unpopular with the weavers and mill workers, they were given a lively reception, and returned to Liverpool without alighting. A grand reception and banquet had been prepared for their arrival.

===Operation===


The was successful and popular, and reduced journey times between Liverpool and Manchester to two hours. Most stage coach companies operating between the two towns closed shortly after the railway opened as it was impossible to compete. Within a few weeks of the line opening, it ran its first excursion trains and carried the world&#x27;s first railway mail carriages; by the summer of 1831, it was carrying special trains to the races. The railway was a financial success, paying investors an average annual dividend of 9.5% over the 15 years of its independent existence: a level of profitability that would never again be attained by a British railway company.

The railway was purposefully designed for the benefit of the public, carrying passengers as well as freight. Shares in the company were limited to ten per person and profits from these were limited. Although the intention had been to carry goods, the canal companies reduced their prices, leading to a price war between them and the railway. The line did not start carrying goods until December, when the first of some more powerful engines, &quot;Planet&quot;, was delivered.

The line&#x27;s success in carrying passengers was universally acclaimed. The experience at Rainhill had shown that unprecedented speed could be achieved and travelling by rail was cheaper and more comfortable than travel by road. The company concentrated on passenger travel, a decision that had repercussions across the country and triggered the &quot;railway mania of the 1840s&quot;. John B. Jervis of the Delaware and Hudson Railway some years later wrote: &quot;It must be regarded ... as opening the epoch of railways which has revolutionised the social and commercial intercourse of the civilized world&quot;.

At first trains travelled at carrying passengers and carrying goods because of the limitations of the track. Drivers could, and did, travel more quickly, but were reprimanded: it was found that excessive speeds forced apart the light rails, which were set onto individual stone blocks without cross-ties. In 1837 the original fish-belly parallel rail of , on sleepers started to be replaced.

The railway directors realised that Crown Street was too far away from the centre of Liverpool to be practical, and decided in 1831 to construct a new terminus at Lime Street. The tunnel from Edge Hill to Lime Street was completed in January 1835 and opened the following year. The station opened on 15 August 1836 before it had been completed.

On 30 July 1842, work started to extend the line from Ordsall Lane to a new station at Hunts Bank in Manchester that also served the Manchester and Leeds Railway. The line opened on 4 May 1844 and Liverpool Road station was then used for goods traffic.

On 8 August 1845, the was absorbed by its principal business partner, the Grand Junction Railway (GJR), which had opened the first trunk railway from Birmingham to Warrington in 1837. The following year the formed part of the London and North Western Railway.

== Signalling ==
The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the first railway to have a system of signalling. This was undertaken by policemen, who were stationed along the line at distances of a mile or less. Initially these policemen signalled that the line was clear by standing straight with their arms outstretched. If the policeman was not present, or was standing at ease, this indicated that there was an obstruction on the line ahead. Gradually a system of hand-held flags was developed, with a red flag being used to stop a train, green indicating that a train should proceed at caution, blue indicating to drivers of baggage trains that there were new wagons for them to take on and a black flag being used by platelayers to indicate works on the track. Any flag waved violently, or at night a lamp waved up and down, indicated that a train should stop. Until 1844 handbells were used as emergency signals in foggy weather, though in that year small explosive boxes placed on the line began to be used instead.

Trains were controlled on a time interval basis: policemen signalled for a train to stop if less than ten minutes had elapsed since a previous train had passed; the signal to proceed at caution was given if more than ten minutes but less than seventeen minutes had passed; otherwise the all clear signal was given. If a train broke down on the line, the policeman had to run a mile down the track to stop oncoming traffic.

After the opening of the Warrington and Newton Railway four policemen were placed constantly on duty at Newton Junction, at the potentially dangerous points where the two lines met. Initially a gilt arrow was used to point towards Warrington to indicate that the points were set in that direction, with a green lamp visible from the line being used to indicate this at night. Later a fixed signal was used, with red and white chequered boards on 12-foot high posts being turned to face trains from one direction if another train was ahead.

In 1837 the London and Birmingham Railway conducted trials using a Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph to direct signalling and in 1841 held a conference to propose a uniform national system of coloured signals to control trains, but despite these advances elsewhere the Liverpool and Manchester Railway continued to be controlled by policemen and flags until its merger with the Grand Junction Railway in 1845.

== Significance ==
On opening the represented a significant advance in railway operation, introducing regular commercial passenger and freight services by steam locomotives with significant speed and reliability improvements from their predecessors and horse carriages. The operation was studied by other upcoming railway companies as a model to aspire to. More recently some have claimed the operation was the first Inter-city railway, though that branding was not introduced until many years later and neither Manchester or Liverpool achieved city status until 1853 and 1880 respectively, nor would the distance between them qualify as &quot;long-haul&quot;.

The subsequently widely adopted gauge of was derived from a George Stephenson recommendation that was accepted at an board meeting in July 1826: &quot;Resolved that the width of the Wagon Way between the rails to be the same as the Darlington Road, namely 4 feet 8 inches clear, inside the rails&quot;. This enabled the Stephensons to test their locomotives on the lines around Newcastle on Tyne before shipment to Lancashire.

The used left-hand running on double track, following practice on British roads. The form of couplings using buffers, hooks and chains, and their dimensions, set the pattern for European practice and practice in many other places.

Even before the opened, connecting and other lines were planned, authorised or under construction, such as the Bolton and Leigh Railway.

==Incidents==
The best-known accident associated with the was the death of William Huskisson, hit by the locomotive &quot;Rocket&quot; on the opening day. Thereafter the pioneering and evolving nature of the early days of the meant accidents were not uncommon. All were investigated by the board or Management Committee. Fatal accidents to travelling passengers were rare, the first two years seeing one for over a million passengers carried, though injuries were more commonplace. These were often caused by passengers failing to heed company regulations and advice. Staff accidents were more commonplace, with some staff preparing to take what later would be considered to be inadvisable risks and disregarding regulations. Locomotives, wagons and infrastructure were involved in a variety of collisions and derailments. 

On 23 December 1832, a passenger train ran into the rear of another passenger train at Rainhill. A passenger was killed and several were injured. On 17 April 1836, a passenger train was derailed whilst travelling at when an axle of a carriage broke. There were no fatalities.

== Modern line ==

The original Liverpool and Manchester line still operates as a secondary line between the two cities—the southern route, the former Cheshire Lines Committee route via Warrington Central is for the moment the busier route. This however has already started to change (from the May 2014 timetable) with new First TransPennine Express services between Newcastle/Manchester Victoria and Liverpool and between Manchester (Airport) and Scotland (via Chat Moss, Lowton and Wigan). From December 2014, with completion of electrification (see below) the two routes between Manchester and Liverpool will have much the same frequency of service.

On the original route, a new (May 2014) hourly First TransPennine Express non-stop service runs between Manchester Victoria and Liverpool (from/to) Newcastle), an hourly fast service is operated by Northern Rail, from Liverpool to Manchester, usually calling at Wavertree Technology Park, St Helens Junction, Newton-le-Willows and Manchester Oxford Road, and continuing via Manchester Piccadilly to Manchester Airport. Northern also operates an hourly service calling at all stations from Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Victoria. This is supplemented by an additional all-stations service between Liverpool and Earlestown, which continues to Warrington Bank Quay.

Between Warrington Bank Quay, Earlestown and Manchester Piccadilly, there are additional services (at least one per hour) operated by Transport for Wales, which originate from Chester and the North Wales Coast Line.

=== Electrification ===
In 2009, electrification at 25 kV AC was announced. The section between Manchester and Newton, including the Chat Moss section, was completed in 2013; the line onwards to Liverpool opened on 5 March 2015.

===Ordsall Chord===
The historic passenger railway station of Manchester Liverpool Road is a Grade I Listed building, and was threatened by the Northern Hub plan. This included the construction of the Ordsall Chord to provide direct access between Victoria and Piccadilly, in turn cutting off access from Liverpool Road. The Science &amp; Industry Museum, that is based at the former station premises, had initially objected to the scheme and an inquiry was set up in 2014 to investigate the potential damage to the historic structure. The chord opened in November 2017 without any damage to the original Liverpool Road station structures.

<doc id="186955" wikidata="Q155002" url="?curid=186955" title="Frederick VI of Denmark">
<text>Frederick VI (Danish and ; 28 January 1768 – 3 December 1839) was King of Denmark from 13 March 1808 until his death in 1839 and King of Norway from 13 March 1808 to 7 February 1814. He was the last king of Denmark–Norway. From 1784 until his accession, he served as regent during his father&#x27;s mental illness and was referred to as the &quot;Crown Prince Regent&quot; (). For his motto he chose &quot;God and the just cause&quot; (). Instead of the customary latin, he used Danish, which established a precedent for later Danish kings who used Danish as well.

Born in Christiansborg Palace, Copenhagen, Frederick VI was the eldest of two children and the only son of Christian VII and Caroline Mathilde. In 1790, Frederick VI married Marie Sophie. Together, they had eight children, though only two daughters, Princess Caroline and Princess Wilhelmine, survived to adulthood. Additionally, He was the last Danish king to have an official mistress, Frederikke Dannemand, with whom he had five children.

His reign as regent is highlighted by the abolition of serfdom, the end of hanging as a capital punishment in the kingdom, and the withdrawal of Dano-Norwegian involvement in the Transatlantic slave trade. Other significant events during his time as regent include the Battle of Copenhagen of 1801 and the Battle of Copenhagen of 1807. His later reign as king is highlighted by his patronage of astronomy, the introduction of primary schools, the creation of the Assemblies of Estate, and the ensurement of full civil rights to the Jews. Other significant events during his reign as king include the end of the Napoleonic Wars the, Congress of Vienna, the loss of Norway, and an economic depression. 

With no surviving legitimate sons, Frederick VI was succeeded by his half-cousin, Christian.

==Early life==
===Birth and family===
The future King Frederick VI was born between 10 and 11 p.m. on 28 January 1768 in the Queen&#x27;s Bedchamber at Christiansborg Palace, the royal residence in central Copenhagen. He was the first child born to King Christian VII and Queen Caroline Mathilde of Denmark and Norway. He was born 15 months after his parents&#x27; wedding, the day before his father&#x27;s 19th birthday, and while his mother was just 16 years old. The King had shown little interest in the Queen after the marriage and only reluctantly visited her in her chambers. The King&#x27;s advisors had to step in, among other things with love letters written in the King&#x27;s name, in an attempt to make the marriage lead to a pregnancy and thus an heir to the throne.
The young prince was baptised already two days after the birth on 30 January at Christiansborg Palace by the royal confessor Ludvig Harboe, Bishop of Zealand, and was named after his late grandfather, King Frederick V. His godparents were King Christian VII (his father), the dowager queen Juliana Maria (his step-grandmother) and his half-uncle, Hereditary Prince Frederick.

===Childhood and upbringing===

At the time of Crown Prince Frederick&#x27;s birth, conditions at the Danish court were characterized by Christian VII&#x27;s increasing mental illness, including suspected schizophrenia expressed by catatonic periods. In the resulting intrigues and power struggles which followed, Christian&#x27;s personal physician, the progressive and radical thinker Johann Friedrich Struensee, became the King&#x27;s advisor and rose steadily in power during the late 1760s, and from 1770 to 1772, Struensee was de facto regent of the country. Struensee soon also became the confidant of Queen Caroline Mathilde, Frederick&#x27;s mother, partly because during a smallpox epidemic in the autumn of 1769, in which over 1,000 children died, he successfully inoculated Crown Prince Frederick with good results. In doing so, Struensee won the gratitude and trust of the neglected Queen and soon became her lover as well. It is widely believed that Struensee was also the biological father of Prince Frederick&#x27;s only sister Princess Louise Augusta, who was born in 1771.

Both the Queen and Struensee were ideologically influenced by Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Therefore, the Queen also fully approved the harsh education recommended by Struensee for the Crown Prince, who was perceived as weak and needed to be strengthened physically and mentally. While Struensee was in power, the young Frederick was raised at Hirschholm Palace following an interpretation of the educational approach advocated by Rousseau in his famous work &quot;Émile&quot;. Instead of receiving direct instruction, Frederick was expected to learn everything through his own efforts through playing with two commoner boys as per Struensee&#x27;s instructions.
The general ill will against Struensee found expression in a conspiracy against him in the name of the Queen Dowager Juliana Maria, and in the early morning of 17 January 1772 Struensee was deposed in a palace coup. Struensee was later executed, while the King and Queen were divorced. Queen Caroline Mathilde was exiled, and the four-year-old Frederick and his sister were left behind, never to see their mother again. After the revolt against Struensee, Frederick&#x27;s 18-year-old half-uncle Hereditary Prince Frederick was made regent. The real power, however, was held by Hereditary Prince Frederick&#x27;s mother (Crown Prince Frederick&#x27;s step-grandmother), Queen Dowager Juliana Maria, aided by Ove Høegh-Guldberg. Frederick was raised under the supervision of Margrethe Marie Thomasine Numsen and then under his chamberlain, Johan Bülow.

==Crown prince&#x27;s regency==
===Coup d&#x27;état in 1784===

Already in 1782, Crown Prince Frederick came in contact with the minister Andreas Peter Bernstorff, who had been dismissed two years earlier. Later the Crown Prince entered into a conspiracy with other disaffected persons who were in opposition to the government. Despite the Crown Prince&#x27;s age, the government deliberately postponed his confirmation that would confirm his adult status. But in 1784, as Crown Prince Frederick turned 16, it could no longer be postponed, and he was finally confirmed on 4 April, and was declared of legal majority. Already, on 14 April 1784, he proceeded to seize the full powers of the regency, dismissing the ministers loyal to the Queen Dowager. It is said that during the coup, he engaged in a fistfight with his half-uncle over the regency. He continued as regent of Denmark-Norway under his father&#x27;s name until the latter&#x27;s death in 1808.

=== Early reforms===

During the first years of the regency, Frederick instituted widespread liberal reforms in the spirit of enlightened absolutism with the assistance of Chief Minister Andreas Peter Bernstorff, including the abolition of serfdom in Denmark in 1788 and hanging as a capital punishment was abolished in 1789 in both Denmark and Norway. In 1803, Dano-Norwegian involvement in the Transatlantic slave trade was abolished by government decree.

===Marriage===

After Crown Prince Frederick was declared of legal majority and assumed the regency in 1784, the Danish royal court started to make inquiries to arrange a marriage for him. There was speculation that he was to marry a Prussian princess, a choice supported by his step-grandmother Juliana Maria and her brother-in-law Frederick the Great. To demonstrate his independence, however, he personally selected his first-cousin Marie Sophie of Hesse-Kassel, a member of a German family with close marriage links with the royal families of both Denmark-Norway and Great Britain. They married in Gottorp on 31 July 1790 and had eight children. Their eldest daughter, Princess Caroline married her father&#x27;s first cousin, Ferdinand, Hereditary Prince of Denmark. The youngest, Princess Wilhelmine, became the wife of the future Frederick VII of Denmark.
== King of Denmark and loss of Norway ==

On 13 March 1808, Christian VII died at the age of 59 at Rendsburg during a stay in the Duchy of Holstein. At the death of his father, Frederick finally ascended the thrones of Denmark and Norway in name also as their seventh absolute monarch at the age of 40. When the throne of Sweden seemed likely to become vacant in 1809, Frederick was interested in being elected there as well. Frederick actually was the first monarch of Denmark and Norway to descend from Gustav I of Sweden, who had secured Sweden&#x27;s independence in the 1520s after the period of the Kalmar Union with other Scandinavian countries. However, Frederick&#x27;s brother-in-law, Prince Christian Augustus of Augustenborg, was first elected to the throne of Sweden, followed by the French Marshal Bernadotte.

In order to maintain neutrality, and avoid the Franco-British conflict, Denmark joined the Second League of Armed Neutrality and continued shipping. However, a disagreement occurred with the British over said neutral shipping as well as refusing to withdraw from the alliance. The English, led by Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, then attacked the Danish fleet in the Battle of Copenhagen of 1801. 

Due to a treaty between tsar Alexander I and Napoleon bonaparte, a promise was made to extend the Continental system to include Denmark and Sweden. In response, England sent an ultimatum to Denmark; become England&#x27;s ally, or hand over their fleet. 
Frederik VI was in Holstein at the time. He did return to the Capital, but then returned to Holstein the next day- without responding to the British. The British then bombarded Copenhagen for three days during the Battle of Copenhagen of 1807. This caused Frederik VI to declare war on England and enter an alliance with France. 

The conflict continued in the Gunboat War between Denmark-Norway and the United Kingdom, which lasted until the Treaty of Kiel in 1814. After the French defeat in Russia in 1812, the Allies asked him to change sides, but he refused. Many historians portray the King as stubborn, incompetent, and motivated by a misconceived loyalty towards Napoleon. However, this narrative has changed over the recent years and some historians have provided a new perspective on the King; Frederick VI stayed with Napoleon in order to protect the exposed situation with his kingdom&#x27;s territory in nowadays Norway, which was dependent on grain imports and had become a target of Swedish territorial ambitions. He expected the wars would end with a great international conference in which Napoleon would have a major voice, and would help protect the crown&#x27;s interests, especially towards the Norwegian region.

After the French defeat in the Napoleonic Wars in 1814 and the loss of the Norwegian crown (as a result of the Treaty of Kiel), Frederick VI carried through an authoritarian and reactionary course, giving up the liberal ideas of his years as a prince regent. Censorship and suppression of all opposition together with the poor state of the country&#x27;s economy made this period of his reign somewhat gloomy, though the King himself in general maintained his position of a well-meaning autocrat. From the 1830s the economic depression was eased a bit and from 1834 the King accepted a small democratic innovation by the creation of the Assemblies of the Estate (purely consultative regional assemblies); this had the unintended result of later exacerbating relations between Danes and Germans in Schleswig, whose regional assembly became a forum for constant bickering between the two national groups.

==Later life and succession==
Frederick VI was known as a patron of astronomy and in 1832 offered gold medal prizes to anyone who discovered a comet using a telescope. His successors continued this until 1850. The prize was terminated in the aftermath of the Three Years&#x27; War. On 23 February 1827, he granted a Royal Charter giving Serampore College in Danish India the status of a university to confer degrees. It became the third Danish University after those in Copenhagen and Kiel. After the discovery of the Haraldskær Woman in a peat bog in Jutland in the year 1835, Frederick VI ordered a royal interment in an elaborately carved sarcophagus for the Iron Age mummy, decreeing it to be the body of Queen Gunnhild. Later this identification proved incorrect, but the action suited his political agenda at the time.

Frederick VI died at the age of 71 at Amalienborg Palace and was buried in Frederick V&#x27;s chapel in Roskilde Cathedral. Frederick reigned over Denmark for a total of 55 years; 24 years as crown prince regent and 31 years as king. He was the 894th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Spain and the 654th Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1822. The Royal Frederick University (now University of Oslo) in Oslo was named in his honour.

As Frederick VI had no surviving sons to succeed him, so he was succeeded on the throne of Denmark by his paternal half-first cousin Christian.

==Descendants==

Frederick VI and his wife Marie of Hesse-Kassel were the parents of eight children, six of whom died in infancy. Two daughters grew to adulthood and neither of them had children. The eight children of Frederick and Marie were:
* Christian (Copenhagen, 22 September 1791 – Copenhagen, 23 September 1791) died in infancy

Both her marriages were without issue.

<text>The Science and Industry Museum in Manchester, England, traces the development of science, technology and industry with emphasis on the city&#x27;s achievements in these fields. The museum is part of the Science Museum Group, a non-departmental public body of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, having merged with the National Science Museum in 2012.

There are extensive displays on the theme of transport (cars, railway locomotives and rolling stock), power (water, electricity, steam and gas engines), Manchester&#x27;s sewerage and sanitation, textiles, communications and computing.

The museum is an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage and is on the site of the world&#x27;s first passenger railway station – Manchester Liverpool Road – which opened as part of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway in 1830. The railway station frontage and 1830 warehouse are both Grade I listed.

== History ==

The museum was called the North Western Museum of Science and Industry when it opened in 1969 in temporary premises on Grosvenor Street in Chorlton-on-Medlock. It had close ties with the University of Manchester Institute of Science &amp; Technology, having mostly grown out of the Department of History of Science &amp; Technology, and UMIST&#x27;s Richard L. Hills was the museum&#x27;s first lecturer in charge.

In 1978, Greater Manchester Council purchased the earliest part of the former Liverpool Road station from British Rail, which had been closed in 1975. The council paid the nominal sum of £1 for the site. The museum opened at this site on 15 September 1983 and later expanded to include the whole of the former station.

Since 2007 the museum has organised an annual science festival in Manchester.

In 2014, it was announced Sally MacDonald would become the director. MacDonald left her role as head of collections at University College London and succeeded Jean Franczyk as director.

In July 2021, the permanent closure of the Air and Space Hall was announced. A spokeswoman has also said that the objects displayed would be returned to their original owners, and the objects owned by the museum would be displayed in future exhibits. The collection was dispersed over the winter of 2021–22.

== Exhibitions ==
Exhibits at the Science and Industry Museum include:

===Computing and communications===
* A replica of the Manchester Baby
* A Connected Earth gallery that tells the history of communications in Manchester and the North West of England opened in October 2007.

===Locomotives===

*Ericsson&#x27;s &quot;Novelty&quot; – A replica incorporating parts from the original locomotive of 1829
*British Rail Class 77 No. 27001, liveried as Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways) No. 1505, &quot;Ariadne&quot; – A 1.5 kV DC electric locomotive built by Metropolitan-Vickers in 1953
*South African Railways GL class Garratt No. 2352 – Built in 1929 by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company, Manchester
*Pakistan Railways 4–4–0 No. 3157 (broad gauge) Originally built for North Western Railway of India by Vulcan Foundry, Newton-le-Willows (around 1911–1914).

==Former galleries==

Previous permanent exhibition galleries which have now been decommissioned include:
* Electricity Gallery - generation, distribution and use of electricity
* Gas Gallery - past to present look at the gas industry
* Underground Manchester - sanitation and water supply
* A space-themed gallery, with exhibits encompassing historical space flight, space science and also science-fiction, formerly took up the majority of the upper balcony of the Air and Space hall. This was eventually considered outdated and removed in its entirety.

===Some past exhibitions===
* Body Worlds 4 between 22 February and 29 June 2008
* LMR 57 Lion Britain&#x27;s oldest steamable locomotive (in the Museum of Liverpool since 2007)
*Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Rocket&quot; – from 25 September 2018 to 8 September 2019

== Railway ==

Until 2018, demonstration passenger trains ran within the museum grounds on selected dates. Trains were hauled by the museum&#x27;s two operational steam locomotives:
*&quot;Planet&quot; – A replica of Robert Stephenson &amp; Company&#x27;s Planet class locomotive, built by the Friends of the Museum of Science and Industry in 1992. The original locomotive was constructed in 1830 and hauled trains on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.
*&quot;Agecroft No. 1&quot; – An 0–4–0 saddle tank built by Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorns in 1948 for use at Agecroft Power Station. Restored to working order in 2011.

The museum&#x27;s railway line was connected to the national rail network near Ordsall Lane Junction. However, construction by Network Rail of the Ordsall Chord railway link, which was completed in 2017, severed this connection and significantly shortened the museum&#x27;s running line despite a legal battle to save it.

As of 2019, railway operations at the museum were suspended indefinitely. In June 2024, the museum confirmed that the railway would not resume operations, citing both the shortened line and concerns over loadbearing issues on the historic structures on the site. The tracks will be incorporated into a redevelopment of the site that will improve accessibility to the area.

== Industrial machines ==
The museum exhibits the large collection of stationary steam engines, hot air engines, diesel engines, hydraulic pumps, large electric generators and other similar machines. Most of these machines are operational and occasionally can be seen running. This exhibit includes the last stationary steam engine built to power a mill.

There is also the exhibit of spinning and weaving machines, covering all the steps from wool to textile. These machines are run for a few minutes at scheduled times.

== Adjacent St John&#x27;s Quarter ==
The museum is adjacent to a £1 billion redevelopment area on the former site of Granada Studios. Work on the area, which will be known as St John&#x27;s Quarter, is expected to be completed by 2022. The Manchester International Festival&#x27;s new Factory venue opened alongside the MSI in 2023 as part of the redevelopment.

The MSI have been granted planning permission to build a new Special Exhibition Gallery on the ground floor of the New Warehouse. Architectural firm Carmody Groarke won a competition to design the new gallery which is set to be complete by October 2020.

In July 2016 the council stated that, along with development partner Allied London, they had been in talks with the MSI &quot;exploring how the presence of Factory opens up new possibilities for revitalising the whole area below Deansgate as a creative hub, with a joined up and extensive public realm. MSI&#x27;s own developments plans are being aligned with this creative vision and the museum itself will become part of the creative public realm, with MSI&#x27;s creative science offer balancing the creative and cultural production of Factory.&quot;

<doc id="186963" wikidata="Q3505077" url="?curid=186963" title="Morlet wavelet">
<text>In mathematics, the Morlet wavelet (or Gabor wavelet) is a wavelet composed of a complex exponential (carrier) multiplied by a Gaussian window (envelope). This wavelet is closely related to human perception, both hearing and vision.

== History ==

In 1946, physicist Dennis Gabor, applying ideas from quantum physics, introduced the use of Gaussian-windowed sinusoids for time-frequency decomposition, which he referred to as &quot;atoms&quot;, and which provide the best trade-off between spatial and frequency resolution. These are used in the Gabor transform, a type of short-time Fourier transform. In 1984, Jean Morlet introduced Gabor&#x27;s work to the seismology community and, with Goupillaud and Grossmann, modified it to keep the same wavelet shape over equal octave intervals, resulting in the first formalization of the continuous wavelet transform.

== Definition ==
The wavelet is defined as a constant formula_1 subtracted from a plane wave and then localised by a Gaussian window:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is defined by the admissibility criterion,
and the normalisation constant formula_4 is:

:formula_5

The Fourier transform of the Morlet wavelet is:

:formula_6

The &quot;central frequency&quot; formula_7 is the position of the global maximum of formula_8 which, in this case, is given by the positive solution to:

:formula_9

which can be solved by a fixed-point iteration starting at formula_10 (the fixed-point iterations converge to the unique positive solution for any initial formula_11).

The parameter formula_12 in the Morlet wavelet allows trade between time and frequency resolutions. Conventionally, the restriction formula_13 is used to avoid problems with the Morlet wavelet at low formula_12 (high temporal resolution).

For signals containing only slowly varying frequency and amplitude modulations (audio, for example) it is not necessary to use small values of formula_12. In this case, formula_1 becomes very small (e.g. formula_17) and is, therefore, often neglected. Under the restriction formula_13, the frequency of the Morlet wavelet is conventionally taken to be formula_19.

The wavelet exists as a complex version or a purely real-valued version. Some distinguish between the &quot;real Morlet&quot; vs the &quot;complex Morlet&quot;. Others consider the complex version to be the &quot;Gabor wavelet&quot;, while the real-valued version is the &quot;Morlet wavelet&quot;.

== Uses ==
=== Use in medicine ===
In magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging, the Morlet wavelet transform method offers an intuitive bridge between frequency and time information which can clarify the interpretation of complex head trauma spectra obtained with Fourier transform. The Morlet wavelet transform, however, is not intended as a replacement for the Fourier transform, but rather a supplement that allows qualitative access to time related changes and takes advantage of the multiple dimensions available in a free induction decay analysis.

The application of the Morlet wavelet analysis is also used to discriminate abnormal heartbeat behavior in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Since the variation of the abnormal heartbeat is a non-stationary signal, this signal is suitable for wavelet-based analysis.

=== Use in music ===
The Morlet wavelet transform is used in pitch estimation and can produce more accurate results than Fourier transform techniques. The Morlet wavelet transform is capable of capturing short bursts of repeating and alternating music notes with a clear start and end time for each note.

A modified morlet wavelet was proposed to extract melody from polyphonic music. This methodology is designed for the detection of closed frequency. The Morlet wavelet transform is able to capture music notes and the relationship of scale and frequency is represented as the follow:

formula_20

where formula_21 is the pseudo frequency to scale formula_22, formula_23 is the center frequency and formula_24 is the sampling time.

Morlet wavelet is modified as described as:

formula_25

and its Fourier transformation:

formula_26

== Application ==
* Signals with time-varying frequencies is a common characteristic in rotating machinery faults, making Morlet wavelet a suitable approach to perform the analysis. By adapting the Morlet wavelet, the system can enhance its ability to capture subtle variations and abnormalities in the machinery signals that may indicate faults. The adaptability of the Morlet wavelet provides a robust method of preprocessing the input signals, therefore ensuring that the system can effectively handle the varying frequencies associated with different fault conditions.
*By treating the Morlet wavelet as a neural network, the researchers aim to enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of HIV prevention measures. The neural network, based on the Morlet wavelet, is designed to recognize intricate patterns indicative of potential HIV risks or vulnerabilities. The adaptability of the Morlet wavelet-based neural network and its integration with existing strategies mark a significant step forward in the ongoing efforts to combat the HIV epidemic.
*The Morlet wavelet, known for its versatility in analyzing signals and its adaptability to nonlinear systems, serves as a key component in corneal system associated with eye surgery. Traditional numerical methods may struggle to capture the intricacies of such systems, making innovative approaches necessary. The Morlet wavelet artificial neural network emerges as a promising tool due to its ability to effectively handle nonlinearities and provide accurate numerical solutions.
*Researchers leveraged the Morlet wavelet transform to extract meaningful features from ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning system signals, taking advantage of its efficacy in preserving temporal and spectral characteristics. This transformative step in preprocessing lays the foundation for robust line-of-sight (LOS) / non-line-of-sight (NLOS) classification. Morlet wavelet has superiority over conventional methods in capturing intricate signal features, contributing significantly to the overall success of the LOS / NLOS identification system.
*By combining Morlet wavelet filtering with phase analysis, it is able to improve the signal-to-noise ration and subsequently reduce the limit of detection(LOD) of thin film optical biosensors. The Morlet wavelet filtering process involves transforming the sensor&#x27;s output signal into the frequency domain. By convolving the signal with the Morlet wavelet, which is a complex sinusoidal wave with a Gaussian envelope, the technique allows for the extraction of relevant frequency components from the signal. This process is particularly advantageous for analyzing signals with non-stationary and time-varying characteristics, making it well-suited for biosensing applications where the target analyte concentrations may vary over time.

<text>William Webb Ellis (24 November 1806 – 24 February 1872) was an English Anglican clergyman who, by tradition, has been credited as the inventor of rugby football while a pupil at Rugby School. According to legend, Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it during a school football match in 1823, thus creating the &quot;rugby&quot; style of play. Although the story has become firmly entrenched in the sport&#x27;s folklore, it is not supported by first-hand evidence, and is discounted by most rugby historians as an origin myth.

The Webb Ellis Cup is presented to the winners of the Rugby World Cup.

==Biography==
William Webb Ellis was born in Salford, Lancashire, the youngest of three sons of James Ellis, a cornet in the 7th Dragoon Guards. The eldest son, James, died aged three and the second son, Thomas, of Dunchurch, Warwickshire, became a surgeon. Third son William was made a Lieutenant of the 3rd Dragoon Guards in 1809, joining them in Portugal. William&#x27;s father James was married for a second time in Exeter in 1804 to Ann, daughter of William Webb, a surgeon, of Alton, Hampshire. His paternal grandfather was from Pontyclun in South Wales, a descendant of the Ellis family of Kiddal Hall, just off the A64 near Potterton, West Riding of Yorkshire.
After his father was killed during the Peninsular War in a cavalry action near Albuera on 1 July 1812, Mrs Ellis, in receipt of an allowance of £30 from His Majesty&#x27;s Royal Bounty in recognition of her husband&#x27;s service, decided to move to Rugby, Warwickshire, so that William and his elder brother, Thomas, would receive an education at Rugby School with no cost as a local foundationer (i.e. a pupil living within a radius of 10 miles of the Rugby Clock Tower). He attended the school in Town House from 1816 to 1825 and was recorded as being a good scholar and cricketer, although it was noted that he was &quot;rather inclined to take unfair advantage at cricket&quot;. The incident in which William Webb Ellis supposedly caught the ball in his arms during a football match (which was allowed) and ran with it (which was not) is supposed to have happened in the latter half of 1823.

After leaving Rugby in 1826, he went to Brasenose College, Oxford, aged 20. He played cricket for his college, and for Oxford University against Cambridge University in a first-class match in 1827. He graduated with a B.A. in 1829 and received his M.A. in 1831. He entered the Church and became chaplain of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Albemarle Street, London (closed ), and then rector of St Clement Danes in the Strand. He became well known as a low church evangelical clergyman. In 1855, he became rector of Magdalen Laver in Essex. A picture of him (the only known portrait) appeared in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; in 1854 after he gave a particularly stirring sermon on the subject of the Crimean War.

He never married and died in the south of France in 1872, leaving an estate of £9,000, mostly to various charities. His grave in &quot;le cimetière du vieux château&quot; at Menton in Alpes Maritimes was rediscovered by Ross McWhirter in 1958, was renovated by the Riviera Hash House Harriers in 2003 and is now maintained by the French Rugby Federation.

==Legend==
===Origin===

The sole source of the story of Webb Ellis picking up the ball originates with one Matthew Bloxam, a local antiquarian and former pupil of Rugby. On 10 October 1876, he wrote to &quot;The Meteor&quot;, the Rugby School magazine, that he had learnt from an unnamed source that the change from a kicking game to a handling game had &quot;...originated with a town boy or foundationer of the name of Ellis, Webb Ellis&quot;.

On 22 December 1880, in another letter to &quot;The Meteor&quot;, Bloxam elaborates on the story:

Bloxam&#x27;s first account differed from his second one four years later. In his first letter, in 1876, Bloxham claimed that Webb Ellis committed the act in 1824, a time by which Webb Ellis had left Rugby. In his second letter, in 1880, Bloxham put the year as 1823.

===1895 investigation===
The claim that Webb Ellis invented the game did not surface until four years after his death, and doubts have been raised about the story since 1895 when the Old Rugbeian Society first investigated it. The sub-committee conducting the investigation was &quot;unable to procure any first-hand evidence of the occurrence&quot;.

Among those giving evidence, Thomas Harris and his brother John, who had left Rugby in 1828 and 1832 respectively (i.e. after the alleged Webb Ellis incident) recalled that handling of the ball was strictly forbidden. Thomas Harris, who requested that he &quot;not [be] quote[d] as an authority&quot;, testified that Webb Ellis had been known as someone to take an &quot;unfair advantage at football&quot;. John Harris, who would have been aged 10 years at the time of the alleged incident, did not claim to have been a witness to it. Additionally, he stated that he had not heard the story of Webb Ellis&#x27;s creation of the game.

Thomas Hughes (author of &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;) was asked to comment on the game as played when he attended the school (1834–1842). He is quoted as saying &quot;In my first year, 1834, running with the ball to get a try by touching down within goal was not absolutely forbidden, but a jury of Rugby boys of that day would almost certainly have found a verdict of &#x27;justifiable homicide&#x27; if a boy had been killed in running in.&quot;

It has been suggested by Dunning and Sheard (2005) that it was no coincidence that this investigation was conducted in 1895, at a time when divisions within the sport led to the schism: the split into the sports of rugby league and rugby union. Dunning and Sheard suggest that the endorsement of a &quot;reductionist&quot; origin myth by the Rugbeians was an attempt to assert their school&#x27;s position and authority over a sport that they were losing control of.

===Alternative theories===
====Caid====
One theory is that Webb Ellis was playing the ancient Irish game Caid, which was similar to Rugby. His father may have been familiar with this game as he had been stationed in Ireland as a soldier with the Dragoons.

====Jem Mackie====
An article by Gordon Rayner in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; about the origin of Rugby football says that Thomas Hughes told the 1895 investigation that in 1838–1839 a Rugby School boy called Jem Mackie &quot;was the first great runner-in&quot;, and that later (in or before 1842) Jem Mackie was expelled from Rugby School for an unspecified incident; in 1845 boys at the school first wrote down an agreed set of rules for the version of football played at Rugby School, which is now rugby football. Gordon Rayner says that the reason for Jem Mackie&#x27;s expulsion may have damaged Mackie&#x27;s reputation so much that Bloxam transferred Mackie&#x27;s part in inventing Rugby football to Webb Ellis, and that a big donation by Bloxam to Rugby School&#x27;s library may have influenced school official acceptance of this Webb Ellis version.

Another theory is that Mackie&#x27;s role may have been disregarded because the committee was seeking to prove Rugby School had invented the game, and thus may have preferred the earliest possible date. England Rugby says that William Webb Ellis&#x27;s action (if it happened) did not lead to any immediate change in the rules but may well have inspired later imitators, though not Mackie, as Thomas Hughes said the Webb Ellis story had not survived into his own time (1834, which was before Mackie popularised running-in during 1838/39).

===Plaque===
A plaque, erected in 1895, at Rugby School, bears the inscription:

THIS STONE&lt;br&gt;
COMMEMORATES THE EXPLOIT OF&lt;br&gt;
WILLIAM WEBB ELLIS&lt;br&gt;
WHO WITH A FINE DISREGARD FOR THE RULES OF FOOTBALL&lt;br&gt;

THUS ORIGINATING THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF&lt;br&gt;
THE RUGBY GAME&lt;br&gt;
A.D. 1823&lt;br&gt;

<doc id="186968" wikidata="Q7718818" url="?curid=186968" title="The Blue Ox Babes">
<text>The Blue Ox Babes were an English pop group, formed in early 1981 by former Dexys Midnight Runners guitarist Kevin &#x27;Al&#x27; Archer, together with his girlfriend Yasmin Saleh, guitarist Nick Bache and former Dexys keyboard player Andy Leek. Archer was keen to mix the soul sounds of his previous group with folk styles. To this end he recruited fiddle player Helen O&#x27;Hara to play on demo tapes of the new songs he had written. When former colleague Kevin Rowland heard these demo tapes, he invited O&#x27;Hara to join Dexys, and adopted a similarly folk-influenced sound for his own group.

By the time the Blue Ox Babes finally released their debut single &quot;There&#x27;s No Deceiving You&quot; on Go! Discs in 1988, the line-up consisted of Archer (guitar and vocals), Saleh (backing vocals), Pete Wain (piano), Nick Smith (saxophone), Ian Pettitt (drums), former Dexys members Steve &#x27;Brennan&#x27; Shaw (fiddle), and Steve Wynne (bass).

&quot;There&#x27;s No Deceiving You&quot; was only a minor chart entry, peaking at No. 94 in the UK. Two other singles, &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot; and &quot;Walking on the Line&quot;, were released but did not chart. A planned album &quot;Apples &amp; Oranges&quot; was recorded by the group but was shelved, and the Blue Ox Babes broke up shortly thereafter. In 2009, a CD of &quot;Apples &amp; Oranges&quot; was finally released, containing all their recordings for Go! Discs, through Cherry Red Records. The package includes all their singles plus many unreleased songs, and several additional demos were also made available as downloads.

<text>In mathematics, Hall&#x27;s marriage theorem, proved by , is a theorem with two equivalent formulations. In each case, the theorem gives a necessary and sufficient condition for an object to exist:
* The combinatorial formulation answers whether a finite collection of sets has a transversal—that is, whether an element can be chosen from each set without repetition. Hall&#x27;s condition is that for any group of sets from the collection, the total unique elements they contain is at least as large as the number of sets in the group.
* The graph theoretic formulation answers whether a finite bipartite graph has a perfect matching—that is, a way to match each vertex from one group uniquely to an adjacent vertex from the other group. Hall&#x27;s condition is that any subset of vertices from one group has a neighbourhood of equal or greater size.

== Combinatorial formulation ==
===Statement===
Let formula_1 be a finite family of sets (note that although formula_1 is not itself allowed to be infinite, the sets in it may be so, and formula_1 may contain the same set multiple times). Let formula_4 be the union of all the sets in formula_1, the set of elements that belong to at least one of its sets. A transversal for formula_1 is a subset of formula_4 that can be obtained by choosing a distinct element from each set in formula_1. This concept can be formalized by defining a transversal to be the image of an injective function formula_9 such that formula_10 for each formula_11. An alternative term for &quot;transversal&quot; is &quot;system of distinct representatives&quot;.

The collection formula_1 satisfies the marriage condition when each subfamily of formula_1 contains at least as many distinct members as its number of sets. That is, for all formula_14,
formula_15
If a transversal exists then the marriage condition must be true: the function formula_16 used to define the transversal maps formula_17 to a subset of its union, of size equal to formula_18, so the whole union must be at least as large. Hall&#x27;s theorem states that the converse is also true:

=== Examples ===

;Example 1
: Consider the family formula_19 with formula_20 and formula_21 The transversal formula_22 could be generated by the function that maps formula_23 to formula_24, formula_25 to formula_26, and formula_27 to formula_28, or alternatively by the function that maps formula_23 to formula_28, formula_25 to formula_24, and formula_27 to formula_26. There are other transversals, such as formula_35 and formula_36. Because this family has at least one transversal, the marriage condition is met. Every subfamily of formula_1 has equal size to the set of representatives it is mapped to, which is less than or equal to the size of the union of the subfamily.
;Example 2
: Consider formula_38 with formula_39 No valid transversal exists; the marriage condition is violated as is shown by the subfamily formula_40. Here the number of sets in the subfamily is formula_41, while the union of the three sets formula_42 contains only two elements.

A lower bound on the different number of transversals that a given finite family formula_1 of size formula_44 may have is obtained as follows: If each of the sets in formula_1 has cardinality formula_46, then the number of different transversals for formula_1 is either formula_48 if formula_49, or formula_50 if formula_51.

Recall that a transversal for a family formula_1 is an ordered sequence, so two different transversals could have exactly the same elements. For instance, the collection formula_53, formula_54 has formula_55 and formula_56 as distinct transversals.

== Graph theoretic formulation ==

Let formula_57 be a finite bipartite graph with bipartite sets formula_4 and formula_59 and edge set formula_60. An &quot;formula_4-perfect matching&quot; (also called an &quot;formula_4-saturating matching&quot;) is a matching, a set of disjoint edges, which covers every vertex in formula_4.

For a subset formula_64 of formula_4, let formula_66 denote the neighborhood of formula_64 in formula_68, the set of all vertices in formula_59 that are adjacent to at least one element of formula_64. The marriage theorem in this formulation states that there is an formula_4-perfect matching if and only if for every subset formula_64 of formula_4: formula_74 In other words, every subset formula_64 of formula_4 must have sufficiently many neighbors in formula_59.

=== Proof ===
====Necessity====
In an formula_4-perfect matching formula_79, every edge incident to formula_64 connects to a distinct neighbor of formula_64 in formula_59, so the number of these matched neighbors is at least formula_83. The number of all neighbors of formula_64 is at least as large.

====Sufficiency====
Consider the contrapositive: if there is no formula_4-perfect matching then Hall&#x27;s condition must be violated for at least one formula_86. Let formula_79 be a maximum matching, and let formula_88 be any unmatched vertex in formula_4. Consider all &quot;alternating paths&quot; (paths in formula_68 that alternately use edges outside and inside formula_79) starting from formula_88. Let formula_64 be the set of vertices in these paths that belong to formula_4 (including formula_88 itself) and let formula_96 be the set of vertices in these paths that belong to formula_59. Then every vertex in formula_96 is matched by formula_79 to a vertex in formula_64, because an alternating path to an unmatched vertex could be used to increase the size of the matching by toggling whether each of its edges belongs to formula_79 or not. Therefore, the size of formula_64 is at least the number formula_103 of these matched neighbors of formula_96, plus one for the unmatched vertex formula_88. That is, formula_106. However, for every vertex formula_107, every neighbor formula_108 of formula_109 belongs to formula_96: an alternating path to formula_108 can be found either by removing the matched edge formula_112 from the alternating path to formula_109, or by adding the unmatched edge formula_112 to the alternating path to formula_109. Therefore, formula_116 and formula_117, showing that Hall&#x27;s condition is violated.

=== Equivalence of the combinatorial formulation and the graph-theoretic formulation ===
A problem in the combinatorial formulation, defined by a finite family of finite sets formula_1 with union formula_4 can be translated into a bipartite graph formula_120 where each edge connects a set in formula_1 to an element of that set. An formula_1-perfect matching in this graph defines a system of unique representatives for formula_1. In the other direction, from any bipartite graph formula_57 one can define a finite family of sets, the family of neighborhoods of the vertices in formula_4, such that any system of unique representatives for this family corresponds to an formula_4-perfect matching in formula_68. In this way, the combinatorial formulation for finite families of finite sets and the graph-theoretic formulation for finite graphs are equivalent.

The same equivalence extends to infinite families of finite sets and to certain infinite graphs. In this case, the condition that each set be finite corresponds to a condition that in the bipartite graph formula_57, every vertex in formula_4 should have finite degree. The degrees of the vertices in formula_59 are not constrained.

== Topological proof ==
Hall&#x27;s theorem can be proved (non-constructively) based on Sperner&#x27;s lemma.

==Applications==
The theorem has many applications. For example, for a standard deck of cards, dealt into 13 piles of 4 cards each, the marriage theorem implies that it is possible to select one card from each pile so that the selected cards contain exactly one card of each rank (Ace, 2, 3, ..., Queen, King). This can be done by constructing a bipartite graph with one partition containing the 13 piles and the other partition containing the 13 ranks. The remaining proof follows from the marriage condition. More generally, any regular bipartite graph has a perfect matching.

More abstractly, let formula_68 be a group, and formula_132 be a finite index subgroup of formula_68. Then the marriage theorem can be used to show that there is a set formula_134 such that formula_134 is a transversal for both the set of left cosets and right cosets of formula_132 in formula_68.

The marriage theorem is used in the usual proofs of the fact that an formula_138 Latin rectangle can always be extended to an formula_139 Latin rectangle when formula_140, and so, ultimately to a Latin square.

== Logical equivalences ==

This theorem is part of a collection of remarkably powerful theorems in combinatorics, all of which are related to each other in an informal sense in that it is more straightforward to prove one of these theorems from another of them than from first principles. These include:

* The König–Egerváry theorem (1931) (Dénes Kőnig, Jenő Egerváry)
* König&#x27;s theorem
* Menger&#x27;s theorem (1927)
* The max-flow min-cut theorem (Ford–Fulkerson algorithm)
* The Birkhoff–Von Neumann theorem (1946)
* Dilworth&#x27;s theorem.

In particular, there are simple proofs of the implications Dilworth&#x27;s theorem ⇔ Hall&#x27;s theorem ⇔ König–Egerváry theorem ⇔ König&#x27;s theorem.

== Infinite families ==

=== Marshall Hall Jr. variant ===
By examining Philip Hall&#x27;s original proof carefully, Marshall Hall Jr. (no relation to Philip Hall) was able to tweak the result in a way that permitted the proof to work for infinite formula_1. This variant extends Philip Hall&#x27;s Marriage theorem.

Suppose that formula_142, is a (possibly infinite) family of finite sets that need not be distinct, then formula_1 has a transversal if and only if formula_1 satisfies the marriage condition.

===Marriage condition does not extend===
The following example, due to Marshall Hall Jr., shows that the marriage condition will not guarantee the existence of a transversal in an infinite family in which infinite sets are allowed.

Let formula_1 be the family, formula_146, formula_147 for formula_148. The marriage condition holds for this infinite family, but no transversal can be constructed.

===Graph theoretic formulation of Marshall Hall&#x27;s variant===
The graph theoretic formulation of Marshal Hall&#x27;s extension of the marriage theorem can be stated as follows: Given a bipartite graph with sides &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, we say that a subset &quot;C&quot; of &quot;B&quot; is smaller than or equal in size to a subset &quot;D&quot; of &quot;A&quot; &quot;in the graph&quot; if there exists an injection in the graph (namely, using only edges of the graph) from &quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot;, and that it is strictly smaller in the graph if in addition there is no injection in the graph in the other direction. Note that omitting &quot;in the graph&quot; yields the ordinary notion of comparing cardinalities. The infinite marriage theorem states that there exists an injection from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; in the graph, if and only if there is no subset &quot;C&quot; of &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;N&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) is strictly smaller than &quot;C&quot; in the graph.

The more general problem of selecting a (not necessarily distinct) element from each of a collection of non-empty sets (without restriction as to the number of sets or the size of the sets) is permitted in general only if the axiom of choice is accepted.

== Fractional matching variant ==
A &quot;fractional matching&quot; in a graph is an assignment of non-negative weights to each edge, such that the sum of weights adjacent to each vertex is at most 1. A fractional matching is &quot;X&quot;-perfect if the sum of weights adjacent to each vertex is exactly 1. The following are equivalent for a bipartite graph &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;X+Y, E&quot;):

* &quot;G&quot; admits an X-perfect matching.
* &quot;G&quot; admits an X-perfect fractional matching. The implication follows directly from the fact that &quot;X&quot;-perfect matching is a special case of an &quot;X&quot;-perfect fractional matching, in which each weight is either 1 (if the edge is in the matching) or 0 (if it is not).
* &quot;G&quot; satisfies Hall&#x27;s marriage condition. The implication holds because, for each subset &quot;W&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, the sum of weights near vertices of &quot;W&quot; is |&quot;W&quot;|, so the edges adjacent to them are necessarily adjacent to at least &quot;|W|&quot; vertices of &quot;Y&quot;.

== Quantitative variant ==
When Hall&#x27;s condition does not hold, the original theorem tells us only that a perfect matching does not exist, but does not tell what is the largest matching that does exist. To learn this information, we need the notion of deficiency of a graph. Given a bipartite graph &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;X&quot;+&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), the &quot;deficiency of G w.r.t. X&quot; is the maximum, over all subsets &quot;W&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, of the difference |&quot;W&quot;| - |&quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;W&quot;)|. The larger is the deficiency, the farther is the graph from satisfying Hall&#x27;s condition. 

Using Hall&#x27;s marriage theorem, it can be proved that, if the deficiency of a bipartite graph &quot;G&quot; is &quot;d&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; admits a matching of size at least |&quot;X&quot;|-&quot;d&quot;.

== Generalizations ==

* A characterization of perfect matchings in general graphs (that are not necessarily bipartite) is provided by the Tutte theorem.
* A generalization of Hall&#x27;s theorem to bipartite hypergraphs is provided by various Hall-type theorems for hypergraphs.

<text>USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; (CVN-68) is an aircraft carrier of the United States Navy, and the lead ship of her class. One of the largest warships in the world, she was laid down, launched, and commissioned as CVAN-68, &quot;aircraft carrier, attack, nuclear powered&quot;, but she was later redesignated as CVN-68, &quot;aircraft carrier, , nuclear-powered&quot;, on 30 June 1975, as part of a fleet-wide realignment that year.

The ship was named after World War II Pacific fleet commander Chester W. Nimitz, USN, (1885–1966), who was the Navy&#x27;s third fleet admiral. &quot;Nimitz&quot; had her homeport at Naval Station Norfolk until 1987, when she was relocated to Naval Station Bremerton in Washington (now part of Naval Base Kitsap). Following her Refueling and Complex Overhaul in 2001, her home port was changed to Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego County, California. The home port of &quot;Nimitz&quot; was again moved to Naval Station Everett in Washington in 2012.

In January 2015, &quot;Nimitz&quot; changed home port from Everett back to Naval Base Kitsap. With the inactivation of in 2012 and decommissioning in 2017, &quot;Nimitz&quot; is now the oldest U.S. aircraft carrier in service, and the oldest serving aircraft carrier in the world.

==Construction==
&quot;Nimitz&quot; was authorized by the U.S. Congress in fiscal year 1967 and Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. in Newport News, Virginia, was awarded the $106.5 million contract (equivalent to $ million today). The keel was laid down on 22 June 1968. The vessel was christened on 13 May 1972, by Catherine Nimitz Lay, the daughter of the late Admiral Nimitz, six years after his death. &quot;Nimitz&quot; was delivered to the Navy in 1975, and was commissioned at Naval Station Norfolk on 3 May 1975, by the 38th President of the United States, Gerald R. Ford.

==&quot;Nimitz&quot; Carrier Strike Group==
&quot;Nimitz&quot; is part of Carrier Strike Group Eleven (CSG-11) with Carrier Air Wing Seventeen (CVW-17) embarked, with &quot;Nimitz&quot; as the flagship of the strike group and the home of the commander of Destroyer Squadron 9.

==Service history==
===1970s===

USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; first deployed to the Mediterranean Sea on 7 July 1976, with Carrier Air Wing 8 embarked in company with the nuclear-powered cruisers and . In November 1976, &quot;Nimitz&quot; was awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; from Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet, for being the most efficient and foremost aircraft carrier in the Atlantic Fleet. The cruise was uneventful, and the carrier returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 7 February 1977.

A second uneventful Mediterranean cruise was conducted from 1 December 1977, to 20 July 1978. The third deployment began on 10 September 1979, to the Mediterranean. The ship moved to the Indian Ocean in response to the Iran hostage crisis in which the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran, was overtaken and 52 hostages were held. Prior to this trip, the ship took part in the shooting of the 1980 film &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, whose story was specifically set aboard the &quot;Nimitz&quot;. After four months on station, Operation Evening Light was launched from &quot;Nimitz&quot;″s decks in an attempt to rescue the U.S. Embassy staff. The mission was aborted after a helicopter crashed at a refueling point in the Iranian desert. The ship returned home 26 May 1980, having spent 144 days at sea.

===1980s===
On 26 May 1981, a Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler assigned to Carrier Air Wing 8 (CVW-8) crashed on the flight deck, killing 14 crewmen and injuring 45 others. The Prowler was fuel-critical after a &quot;bolter&quot; (missed approach), and its crash and the subsequent fire and explosions destroyed or damaged nineteen other aircraft. Autopsies showed later that the pilot had had six times the normal level of the stimulant brompheniramine in his blood.
Despite having no connection to the accident, the media focused on the autopsy results of several members of the &quot;Nimitz&quot;″s enlisted flight deck crew who were killed, who tested positive for marijuana. In an article by Robert Reinhold in the 17 June 1981, edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it was reported that &quot;Experts at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say that it would probably be impossible to establish conclusively that any of the Nimitz crew had been smoking marijuana on the night of the crash because the test does not directly detect the component of marijuana smoke that acts on the brain. Because the metabolites may persist in the blood for many days, the test may detect marijuana that was used many days earlier long after the effects have worn off&quot;. As a result, President Ronald Reagan instituted a &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; drug policy across all of the U.S. armed services, which started the mandatory drug testing of all U.S. military personnel.
&quot;Nimitz&quot; deployed again to the Mediterranean on 3 August 1981. The ship, in company with , conducted a Freedom of Navigation exercise in international waters in the Gulf of Sidra near Libya on 18 and 19 August 1981. On the morning of 19 August 1981, two Grumman F-14 Tomcats of VF-41 were engaged by two Libyan Su-22s, resulting in the two Libyan aircraft being shot down in what became known as the Gulf of Sidra incident.

&quot;Nimitz&quot;″s fourth deployment, from 10 November 1982, to 20 May 1983, was to the Caribbean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;Nimitz&quot; deployed for a fifth time on 8 March 1985. On 14 June 1985, two Lebanese gunmen hijacked TWA Flight 847, which carried 153 passengers and crew and included Americans. In response, &quot;Nimitz&quot; was deployed to the coast of Lebanon, where the ship remained until August 1985. The embarked Airwing 8 flew continuous sorties for 67 days, bombing several sites in Beirut including the runways of Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport. The ship returned to Norfolk on 4 October 1985.

&quot;Nimitz&quot;, again with CVW-8 embarked, departed Norfolk for the sixth and final Mediterranean deployment on 30 December 1986. After four months and numerous Mediterranean port visits, the carrier crossed the equator en route to Rio de Janeiro. From Rio de Janeiro, she proceeded south around Cape Horn and into the Pacific Ocean. After a brief stop in San Diego, to offload the East Coast air wing, &quot;Nimitz&quot; arrived at her new home port of Bremerton, Washington, on 2 July 1987.

&quot;Nimitz&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific with Carrier Air Wing 9 embarked on 2 September 1988. During the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, &quot;Nimitz&quot; provided security off the coast of South Korea, then in October, operated in the North Arabian Sea participating in Operation Earnest Will, the protection of reflagged Kuwaiti tankers. On 30 November 1988, while in the Arabian Sea, a 20 mm cannon accidentally fired during maintenance, striking a KA-6 Intruder. The ensuing fire spread to six other aircraft, and two sailors were killed. &quot;Nimitz&quot; returned to Bremerton on 2 March 1989.

===1990s===
On 25 February 1991, &quot;Nimitz&quot; departed Bremerton for the Persian Gulf in relief of in the aftermath of Operation Desert Storm, returning to Bremerton on 24 August 1991. &quot;Nimitz&quot; again deployed to the Persian Gulf on 1 February 1993, in support of Operation Southern Watch, returning on 1 August 1993.

On 27 November 1995, &quot;Nimitz&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf with Carrier Air Wing Nine (CVW-9). In March 1996, the ship patrolled the waters off Taiwan amid missile tests conducted by the Chinese in the area, becoming the first American warship to pass through the Taiwan Strait since 1976. &quot;Nimitz&quot; also cruised the Persian Gulf in support of Southern Watch prior to returning from deployment on 20 May 1996.

Between 14 and 24 July 1997, &quot;Nimitz&quot; participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 97-2 (JTFEX 97–2) off the coast of southern California, which also served as a &quot;Revolution in Strike Warfare&quot; demonstration. The latter event was designed to demonstrate the capability of an aircraft carrier and an embarked air wing to project carrier-based airpower into littoral warfare. On 20 July 1997, &quot;Nimitz&quot; and Carrier Air Wing Nine began a high-intensity strike campaign. When flight operations were completed four days later, &quot;Nimitz&quot; and Carrier Air Wing Nine had carried out 771 strike sorties while dropping 1,337 bombs on target. Carrier Air Wing Nine flew 975 fixed-wing sorties during this four-day surge operation. Almost 80 percent of the sorties flown were strike sorties, with strike support accounting for another 10 percent. F/A-18 Hornet strike fighters flew nearly 80 percent of the strike sorties. Of the 771 strike sorties, 727 were loaded with ordnance, while 44 were electronic support by EA-6B Prowlers. During this four-day period, only a portion of the medium-range interdiction strikes required tanking support. KC-135 and KC-130 tanker aircraft provided most of this support. S-3 Vikings conducted recovery tanking and supplied more than one-third of the fuel passed to Carrier Air Wing Nine aircraft during this surge operation. This surge had been preceded by a 16-hour preparation after undergoing four days that had generated about 700 fixed-winged sorties. A following study by the Center for Naval Analyses determined that &quot;Nimitz&quot; and Carrier Air Wing Nine could have maintained this high-sortie operational tempo for another twelve to twenty-four hours before requiring equipment maintenance, rest for the crews while ordnance and aviation fuel stocks to be replenished.

On 1 September 1997, &quot;Nimitz&quot; began an around the world cruise, again supporting Southern Watch, which ended in Newport News, Virginia on 2 March 1998. She next spent the next three years undergoing a nuclear Refueling and Complex Overhaul that ended on 25 June 2001.

===2000s===

On 21 September 2001, after sea trials in the Virginia Capes, &quot;Nimitz&quot; began to transit around South America to the new home port of NAS North Island in San Diego, California, arriving there on 13 November 2001. Aircraft from Carrier Air Reserve Wing 20 were embarked for the transit. From January to May 2002, a four-month post-shakedown maintenance availability was completed at North Island; during this time Advanced Combat Direction System was installed.

&quot;Nimitz&quot;″s eleventh operational deployment began on 3 March 2003. The group relieved in the Persian Gulf in mid-April 2003, launching Carrier Air Wing 11 aircraft sorties over Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). She returned to San Diego on 5 November 2003. &quot;Nimitz&quot; and CVW-11 were awarded the 2003 Battle &quot;E&quot; and Flatley Award in early 2004.

In November 2004, &quot;Nimitz&quot; was contacted by , which was tracking reported unidentified flying objects. &quot;Princeton&quot; subsequently contacted two Navy F/A-18F fighters from &quot;Nimitz&quot; whose cockpit instrumentation recorded data and imagery that some pilots interpreted as an object accelerating and maneuvering at extraordinary speeds. The incident was publicized in December 2017 along with details of the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program.

&quot;Nimitz&quot;, again with CVW-11 embarked, deployed to the Persian Gulf on 7 May 2005, returning on 8 November 2005. This deployment marked three decades of service, and was depicted in the Emmy award-winning 2008 PBS documentary series &quot;Carrier&quot;. In June 2006, &quot;Nimitz&quot; was awarded the 2005 Battle &quot;E&quot;.

The carrier departed North Island for her thirteenth deployment on 2 April 2007, to the Arabian Sea, relieving in support of OIF. The carrier anchored off Chennai, India on 2 July 2007, as part of efforts to expand bilateral defense cooperation between India and the United States. Sailors participated in community work in Chennai prior to departing, on 5 July 2007, along with the destroyer towards the Persian Gulf, and then returned to North Island on 30 September 2007.

On 24 January 2008, &quot;Nimitz&quot; deployed to the Pacific for a &quot;surge&quot;-deployment. On 9 February 2008, two Russian Tu-95 &#x27;Bear&#x27; bombers overflew the carrier in the Western Pacific. Four F/A-18C Hornets were launched when the bombers were away from the US ships, and intercepted the bombers south of &quot;Nimitz&quot;. Two F/A-18s trailed one of the bombers, which twice flew over the deck of the carrier at an altitude of , while the other two F/A-18s trailed another Tu-95 circling about away from the carrier. Reportedly, there was no radio communication between the American and Russian aircraft. According to the Department of Defense, one of the two aircraft was said to have flown above &quot;Nimitz&quot; at an altitude of . On the same day, Russian aircraft entered Japanese airspace, which caused the Japanese to raise protest to the Russian ambassador in Tokyo.

Again, on 5 March 2008, a Russian bomber came within and flew above &quot;Nimitz&quot;, and the battle group. Two F/A-18 fighters intercepted the Russian aircraft and escorted it out of the area.

&quot;Nimitz&quot; was awarded the Navy Battle &quot;E&quot; for battle efficiency for 2007 along with the Ney award for food service excellence, and returned to her home port of San Diego on 3 June 2008.

The &quot;Nimitz&quot; Strike Group, including CVW-11, departed the States for a scheduled Western Pacific deployment on 31 July 2009, and began to fly combat missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 21 September.

===2010s===

In January 2010, while in the Persian Gulf, the ship was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for back-to-back deployments in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008. The award was presented by Admiral Gary Roughead in a ceremony on the ship on 6 January 2010.

&quot;Nimitz&quot; visited Hong Kong for five days in February 2010 to allow the crew to rest and visit the city. The visit occurred despite China previously preventing a visit by the carrier .

On 9 December 2010, the Navy formally announced that Everett, Washington was to be the new home port for &quot;Nimitz&quot;. This move was expected to save the Navy $100 million. On 9 March 2012, &quot;Nimitz&quot; arrived at her new homeport of Naval Station Everett after spending nearly a week at sea conducting post overhaul sea trials.

In March 2012, &quot;Nimitz&quot; arrived at the new home port of Naval Station Everett in Washington state after more than a year of maintenance work in Bremerton, replacing sister carrier, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. On 3 August 2012, &quot;Nimitz&quot; departed from Pearl Harbor after a two-day port call, arriving at NAS North Island on 9 August 2012, to begin Fleet Replacement Squadron carrier qualifications. On 6 October 2012, a Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft from squadron VMM-165 landed and refueled on board &quot;Nimitz&quot;. This operation was part of an evaluation of the feasibility of the MV-22 as a potential replacement for the C-2 Greyhound carrier onboard delivery (COD) cargo transport aircraft.


The BBC reported that &quot;Nimitz&quot; was located in the Persian Gulf, ready to contribute to an operation against Syria when President Obama ordered a military strike. Two days later it was reported that the carrier task group had been re-routed westwards across the Arabian Sea.

It was reported that &quot;Nimitz&quot;, after eight months at sea, transited the Suez Canal on 20 October 2013, into the U.S. 6th Fleet area of responsibility, where the Navy intended to keep her for a few weeks conducting joint training with allied nations before returning home. &quot;Nimitz&quot; returned to Everett on 16 December 2013.

In late 2014, following the completion of work up qualifications, &quot;Nimitz&quot; participated in her first deployment, a two-week multi-national fleet exercise involving the Third Fleet, as well as ships from the Royal Canadian Navy and JMSDF. Following the conclusion of the exercise, on 3 November the first F-35C Lightning II to land on an aircraft carrier recovered aboard &quot;Nimitz&quot; to begin a two-week Development Testing I deployment. This saw a pair of aircraft from VX-23 undertaking carrier operations of launch, recovery and handling aboard ship in both day and night conditions. The initial deployment was completed on 14 November 2014. In 2015, &quot;Nimitz&quot; transferred to Bremerton to undergo a 16-month maintenance cycle.

On 1 June 2017, &quot;Nimitz&quot; left Naval Base Kitsap for her next scheduled deployment. This deployment was against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Her F/A-18s played an important role in the Battle of Tal Afar, providing precision air support for advancing Iraqi soldiers.

On 1 March 2018, &quot;Nimitz&quot; entered dry dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for ten months of overhaul.

=== 2020s ===
In April 2020, the coronavirus was reported to have spread to &quot;Nimitz&quot; when the first case was reported on 7 April. One sailor had received a positive result the previous week after exhibiting symptoms, and was subsequently placed in isolation and removed from the ship. Another crew member also tested positive, but was reported to have not been working on the ship. On 27 April, &quot;Nimitz&quot; completed a 27-day quarantine and began COMPTUEX training.

On 5 July 2020, the ship was deployed in the South China Sea along with . On 31 December, acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller ordered &quot;Nimitz&quot; to return directly to her home port following a nearly ten-month deployment in the Fifth Fleet area of operation. The carrier was at the time supporting the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Somalia along with and her amphibious ready group. On 3 January 2021, in an abrupt reversal, acting Defense Secretary Miller ordered &quot;Nimitz&quot; to redeploy due to &quot;Recent threats issued by Iranian leaders against President Trump and other U.S. government officials.&quot;

In May 2022, &quot;Nimitz&quot; led Carrier Strike Group 11 in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. On 28 November 2022, &quot;Nimitz&quot; departed Kitsap and sailed to San Diego to pick up the carrier strike group leadership. She left San Diego on 3 December, for her Pacific deployment leading Carrier Strike Group 11 and embarking Carrier Air Wing 17.

&quot;Nimitz&quot; logged her 350,000th arrested landing on 22 April 2023.

===Planned retirement===
The &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years. Estimates on decommissioning for &quot;Nimitz&quot; herself were updated in April 2022, with the Navy Press Corps indicating that, “USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; (CVN 68) is planned to be removed from the battle force in fiscal year (FY) 2025, when the ship&#x27;s Terminal Off-load Program begins, with inactivation scheduled to begin in 2027.”

==In popular culture==

&quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, a 1980 alternate history science fiction film about a contemporary aircraft carrier that travels through time to the day before the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, was set and filmed on board the real-life USS &quot;Nimitz&quot;.

&quot;Nimitz&quot; is the focus of &quot;The Big Aircraft Carrier&quot; in Little Mammoth Media&#x27;s &quot;BIG Adventure Series&quot;. In it, they talk how the navy ship works for children including a complete tour of the carrier, how the sailors and pilots work and even all the training they undertake.

The PBS series &quot;Carrier&quot; followed the May–November 2005 deployment of &quot;Nimitz&quot; to the Persian Gulf, documenting the life and shipboard routines of the crew over ten episodes.

<text>This article gives an overview of well-known professional and amateur players of the board game Go throughout the ages. The page has been divided into sections based on the era in which the Go players played and the country in which they played. As this was not necessarily their country of birth, a flag of that country precedes every player&#x27;s name. For a complete list of player articles, see :Category:Go players.

The important dates that this separation is based on are:
* The establishment of the Four go houses at the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate.
* The demise of the houses in the Meiji Period (end 19th century) followed by their replacement by the Nihon Kiin in 1924.
* The start of international tournament Go in 1989

A Japanese census on Go players performed in 2002 estimates that over 24 million people worldwide play Go, most of whom live in Asia. Most of the players listed on this article are professionals, though some top level amateurs have been included. Players famous for achievements outside Go are listed in their own section.

== Prior to 17th century ==
Wei Qi was recorded throughout the history of China. The first record of Wei Qi player was by Mencius.
===China===
==17th through 19th centuries==
In the 17th, 18th and 19th century, Go was popular in both Japan (Edo period) and China (period of the Qing dynasty). In Korea, a Go variant called Sunjang baduk was played.

===Japan===
At the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate, four Go academies were established. This table lists all heads of these houses, as well as some that were appointed heir but died before they became head of the house. Tokugawa also established the post of Godokoro (minister of Go), which was awarded to the strongest player of a generation. Such players were dubbed Meijin (brilliant man), which was considered equal to a 9 dan professional grade. Over the 300-year period covered here, only ten players received the title of Meijin. Several other players (16 total) received the title of Jun-Meijin (half-Meijin), which is considered to equal an 8 dan professional grade and listed as such below. In some houses it was the custom that the head of the house was always named the same according to the iemoto system (家元). All heads of the house Inoue (井上) were named Inseki (因碩), heads of the house Yasui (安井 ) were named Senkaku (仙角) from the 4th head onward, and heads of the house Hayashi (林) were named Monnyu (門入) from the second head onward. To distinguish between these players, the names listed below are the names they had before becoming head of their house, or after their retirement. The house Honinbo (本因坊) had no such tradition, although heads would often take one character from the name of their predecessor into their own name, notably the character Shu (秀) from the 14th head onward.
*All ranks are professional dan grades unless otherwise noted.

<doc id="186977" wikidata="Q7720624" url="?curid=186977" title="The Bureau (band)">
<text>The Bureau were an English new wave soul group formed in November 1980 in Birmingham, England, when the original line-up of Dexys Midnight Runners split up. The Bureau retained their Dexys roots and played powerful brass-driven soul sounds. They are best known for their single &quot;Only For Sheep&quot;, which reached No. 5 in Australia.

==History ==
===Formation===
Ex-Dexys members Pete Williams (bass), Geoff Blythe (tenor saxophone), Steve Spooner (alto saxophone), Stoker (drums) and Mick Talbot (keyboards) engaged the services of manager Dave Corke, a previous manager of Dexys Midnight Runners, and promoted concerts in Birmingham to raise money to finance the group.

In December 1980, the band was joined by Rob Jones (guitar and trumpet), Tony Bischoff (bass) and Archie Brown (vocals) from a group called The Upset, which had supported Dexys on tour. The Bureau began rehearsals with a trombonist known only as Jake (formerly of the R&amp;B, soul, funk act Gonzalez), who came and went.

===&quot;Only For Sheep&quot;===
In February 1981, The Bureau signed a deal with record label WEA and recorded their debut single, &quot;Only For Sheep&quot; / &quot;The First One&quot;, with producer Pete Wingfield (who had produced Dexys&#x27; album &quot;Searching for the Young Soul Rebels&quot;) at London&#x27;s Vineyard Studios. A video was recorded for &quot;Only For Sheep&quot; before the band left the UK for debut tour dates in the Netherlands and Belgium. Permanent trombone player Paul Taylor was recruited at the eleventh hour and joined the group for the dates. The first gig in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, was reviewed in UK music paper &quot;NME&quot; and the second gig at the Paradiso Club, Amsterdam, was recorded for Dutch radio. &quot;Only For Sheep&quot; was released in March 1981 and was a hit in Australia, reaching No. 5, but failed to reach the UK Singles Chart.

On 12 March, The Bureau played their first British gig, a showcase, at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in London. At the end of March 1981, the band rehearsed and recorded new songs for their debut album including the follow-up single &quot;Let Him Have It&quot;, inspired by the Derek Bentley/Christopher Craig case. In April 1981, The Bureau made a debut live TV appearance on BBC Midlands show &quot;Look Here&quot; and recorded four more songs for the debut album. They embarked on an extensive UK and Ireland tour beginning at the Forum Ballroom in Kentish Town, London, on 16 April and ending at The Lyceum on 17 May. The single &quot;Let Him Have It&quot; / &quot;The Noose&quot; was released in May 1981 and listed as &quot;Record Of The Week&quot; in UK music paper &quot;Record Mirror&quot; but failed to chart. In June 1981, The Bureau played a gig supporting Hazel O&#x27;Connor and The Specials at Butts Athletic Stadium in Coventry. Their performance was described as &quot;triumphant&quot; by music journalist Simon Tebbutt. They then supported The Pretenders on tours of the UK and America between July and September 1981. Some gigs included members of The Bureau appearing with The Pretenders for a cover of Jackie Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Higher And Higher&quot;, a recording of which appears on the CD reissue of The Pretenders album &quot;Pretenders II&quot;.

=== Albums===
The album &quot;The Bureau&quot; was released in 1981, but only in Canada and Australia. The Canadian version of the album (catalogue number XWEA 58357) was eponymous but, in Australia, the album was titled &quot;Only For Sheep&quot; (catalogue number 600104). In Australia the song &quot;Let Him Have It&quot; was titled &quot;Let Him Have It (Sweet Revenge)&quot;.

The Bureau embarked on a second UK tour in November and December 1981 sharing the bill with the Mo-dettes, and Roddy Radiation and The Tearjerkers. The tour was dubbed &quot;The Good, The Bad And The Ugly Tour&quot; and ended at The Venue, Victoria, London, on 23 December 1981. The band dissolved soon after completing the tour.

The album finally became available in the UK when it received a CD release in 2005. The CD includes extra tracks not available on the original release, including an eleven-track concert and the video for &quot;Only For Sheep&quot;.

The band reunited to play two launch gigs in London and Birmingham in February 2005, prompting the members to write and rehearse new material. October 2008 saw the release of a second, new album in the UK entitled &quot;And Another Thing...&quot;, which was released through the band&#x27;s website and promoted via live gigs in Newcastle, Birmingham and London, and an appearance on Jools Holland&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show.

===Post-breakup===
Talbot went on to enjoy greater success as the co-founder with Paul Weller of The Style Council, while Brown formed Flag with ex-Secret Affair guitarist Dave Cairns. His current band, Archie Brown and The Young Bucks, is based in Newcastle, with a catalogue of nine albums and a line-up of Brown (vocals, saxophone, guitar), Patrick Rafferty (vocals, accordion, guitar, lap steel guitar, keyboards), Ian Thompson (bass), Phil Screaton (lead guitar) and Neil Ramshaw (drums). Blythe teamed up with former colleague Big Jim Paterson in The TKO Horns. Pete Williams went on to form the band These Tender Virtues in the mid-1980s and, more recently, Baseheart.

During the early 2000s, Williams and Talbot joined Kevin Rowland in a reformed Dexys to record new material, but nothing was released at that time.

2011 saw the emergence of a new project, GI Blythe, featuring Geoff Blythe (saxophones) and Archie Brown (vocals), along with Big Jim Paterson (ex-Dexys Midnight Runners, trombone), Larry Baeder (guitars), Joe &quot;Bearclaw&quot; Burcaw (bass), Pete Levin (keyboards) and Crispin Taylor (drums). The band released a debut album entitled &quot;Lost In Space&quot; in January 2012. At the same time, Williams, Talbot, and Paterson were recording &quot;One Day I&#x27;m Going to Soar&quot; with Rowland and the new Dexys, which was released in June 2012.

Pete Williams also released a solo album, &quot;SEE&quot;, in January 2012 to critical acclaim; Richard Hawley guests on guitar along with Paul Taylor on trombone. Williams released &quot;Roughnecks and Roustabouts&quot; in March 2015 with guests Mick Talbot and Josie Lawrence.

<text>Wu Chuan (), courtesy name Wu Ching-yuan () (June 12, 1914 – November 30, 2014), better known by the Japanese pronunciation of his courtesy name, , was a Han Chinese master of the game of Go. He is considered by many players to have been the greatest Go player in the 20th century.

== Biography ==
Born on June 12, 1914, in Minhou County, Fujian Province, southeast China, Go Seigen did not start learning Go until he was nine, a relatively late age for a professional (Honinbo Dosaku first learned go at seven and Honinbo Shusaku before he was six). His father, who had taken go lessons from Honinbo Shuho while studying in Japan, was responsible for introducing him to the game. Go Seigen quickly excelled and soon became known as a Go prodigy. By the time he was 12, less than three years after first learning the game, he was already of professional strength, as evidenced by his games against the visiting Japanese player Iwamoto Kaoru, 6p in 1926. 
The next year, he was able to reach a draw in a two-game match against another Japanese professional, Inoue Kohei, 5p. In 1928, still only 14 years old, he twice defeated Hashimoto Utaro, 4p. Go Seigen&#x27;s reputation spread to Japan, then the leading Go powerhouse, and a movement was started there to bring him to Japan. He subsequently emigrated to Japan in 1928, at the invitation of Baron Kihachiro Okura and Inukai Tsuyoshi (later prime minister of Japan), and embarked on a professional career. He was tutored by Segoe Kensaku, the same teacher as Hashimoto Utaro and Cho Hunhyun.

Go Seigen began his rise to the top of the professional go world early. By the time he was 18 he was already a top-flight player belonging to a very small elite. In 1933, along with his great friend Kitani Minoru, Go Seigen developed and popularized the &quot;Shinfuseki&quot; that broke away from the traditional opening patterns. It is for this very important contribution that Go Seigen and Kitani are recognized as the fathers of modern Go.

Starting in 1939, Go Seigen began a spectacular series of Jubango matches against other top players of the day. It was through these matches that Go Seigen convincingly demonstrated an overwhelming dominance over his contemporaries. Go Seigen had only two formal disciples—Rin Kaiho, Honorary Tengen and Rui Naiwei, who was the strongest female go player ever and won open Guksu title.

In the 1940s, Go Seigen became involved in the Jiu () shinshūkyō, which sprouted out of Oomoto. After the Jikoson incident in 1947, he and his wife distanced themselves from the cult. In November 1948, both had formally left.

===Retirement and death===
In the summer of 1961, Go Seigen was struck by a motorcycle and was hospitalized for two months, and again for a longer period a year later. He suffered nerve damage, and his stamina and concentration greatly deteriorated as a result. The accident marked the beginning of the end for Go Seigen&#x27;s career, as he was unable to play effectively in grueling long matches due to nausea and dizziness. He gradually played less and less often, and went into virtual retirement in 1964, although he did not &quot;officially&quot; retire until 1983.

After his retirement, Go Seigen remained active in the Go community by teaching, writing, and promoting the game around the world. He authored a number of books on go, some of which include &quot;A Way of Play for the 21st Century&quot;, &quot;Modern Joseki Application Dictionary&quot;, and &quot;Fuseki and Middle-game Attack and Defense&quot;. Go Seigen held study sessions with other professional players such as O Rissei, Michael Redmond, Rui Naiwei, and others.

In 1987, Go Seigen was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd Class, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, for his lifetime contributions to Go.

In 1999 Mr. Teramoto, Go Seigen&#x27;s manager, told go writer Pieter Mioch &quot;He [Go Seigen] is one of three Go players who will still be notable several hundred years from now. The other two are Dosaku (1645 – 1702) and Shusaku (1829 – 1862).&quot;

In the early morning of 30 November 2014, Go Seigen died of natural causes at a hospital in Odawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, at the age of 100. 

According to his wishes, he was buried at his hometown Fuzhou, China.

==Professional record==

Go Seigen is commonly considered to be among the best to have ever played go, and is frequently deemed to have been the best player of the 20th century. He dominated professional go for more than a quarter of a century. He maintained a brilliant match record and successively defeated all the leading players of the day in a series of notable jubango (contests between two players consisting of ten games), even forcing them down to handicaps. Some of the defeated were Kitani Minoru, Karigane Junichi, Hashimoto Utaro, Iwamoto Kaoru, Fujisawa Hosai, Sakata Eio, and Takagawa Kaku. Go lost just one jubango, and that was against Fujisawa Hosai. However, the match was played with Fujisawa taking the josen handicap throughout, and Fujisawa only managed to win with a score of 6 to 4. Some ten years later, Go Seigen took revenge on Fujisawa by beating him in two consecutive jubango with lopsided scores of 7–2 and 5–1 respectively. These jubango matches were all played without komi, and indeed the same applied to the vast majority of games Go Seigen played during his career. Go Seigen won the Oteai six times, and won a special Nihon Ki-in championship tournament in 1933.

A table of Go&#x27;s jubango record is below.

==Style==
Go Seigen was notable for his fast-paced development and playing, fighting style, positional judgment and accurate reading. He settled his groups quickly, got to the big points first, and regularly used much less time in a game than his opponents. He was exceptional at using thickness and making large exchanges. His reading was fast and accurate, and his intuition and positional judgment were often praised. It was also noted that he rarely lost a ko fight that he initiated. Like many players of his time he mastered the Shusaku Opening before switching to his later style.

==Theory==
In addition to being a peerless match player, Go Seigen has also made great contributions to go theory, especially in the area of fuseki. He is well known, along with Kitani Minoru, as one of the two leading exponents and innovators of the &quot;shinfuseki&quot;, a period of revolutionary experimentation in the opening of the game that broke away from traditional moves. Go attributed some of his ideas to Honinbo Shuei, for whom he had much respect. As a result of their substantial contributions to go theory, Go Seigen and Kitani Minoru are regarded as the founders of modern go. He was inventor of the notable and revolutionary &quot;uchimagari&quot; (inward bending) avalanche joseki variation. It was first played during a match against Takagawa Kaku in 1957.

==Matches against the Honinbos==
During the 1950s, apart from playing the &quot;jubango&quot;, Go Seigen participated in many three-game special matches against the Honinbo title holders and other notable players. His opponents in these matches included many illustrious names, such as Hashimoto Utaro, Sakata Eio, Takagawa Shukaku, and the ex-Honinbo Iwamoto Kaoru. Go Seigen was also matched against Kubouchi Shuchi, a player from the Kansai Ki-in who had a strong individual style. In these matches, Go Seigen demonstrated an equal dominance over his rivals. He had an excellent record against Takagawa, whose main achievement was winning the Honinbo title for nine consecutive years. In the period between 1951 and 1960, Go won 22 of their games, and Takagawa won 13. By 1960, Sakata had emerged as Go Seigen&#x27;s most serious rival, but the results of their games between 1950 and 1960 told the same kind of story. Go had 14 wins to Sakata&#x27;s 9 and one &quot;jigo&quot;, or draw.
At the time the games were played, there was no Komi (in modern era, Black&#x27;s initial advantage of moving first is offset by komi of 6.5–7.5 points). Because Go Seigen held white most of the time, his record is even more impressive than it appears.

===Notable game against Honinbo Shusai===

In 1933, Go Seigen won a special Nihon Ki-in tournament to have the opportunity to play a game against Honinbo Shusai Meijin. At that juncture, Honinbo Shusai embodied the highest go authority and tradition in Japan. In addition to inheriting the hereditary title of Honinbo, he was also the holder of the prestigious position of Meijin. The game between Go Seigen and Shusai was thus highly anticipated. The newspapers thought it would be a good business idea to publicize the game as a confrontation between Japan and China. As a consequence, Go Seigen became the unfortunate victim of rising Japanese nationalism. Before and during the game, he was often harassed and threatened by nationalists, and the windows of his house were smashed in.

The game itself began on October 16, 1933, with Go Seigen taking black and lasted for a period of almost three months. During the opening of the game, Go Seigen caused quite a sensation by playing his first three moves at 3-3 (San San), 4-4 (Hoshi) and center (Tengen) points. Such a fuseki had never before been witnessed in a professional game, and the newspapers covering the game recorded top sales all throughout the match. This marked one of the seminal events that pushed the &quot;Shin Fuseki&quot; movement into the mainstream.

The match ended with Honinbo Shusai winning by two points. However, his victory was surrounded by controversies. At the time of the match, the tradition dictated that the player holding white had the right to adjourn the game at any time, and there was no sealing of moves before adjournment. This meant that Shusai, being the nominally stronger player and thus holding white, could adjourn the match whenever it was his turn to move and continue deliberating at home before the match resumed. Shusai shamelessly abused this privilege by adjourning the game more than a dozen times, all at his turn to play. For instance, on the eighth day of the match, Shusai played first, and Go Seigen replied within two minutes, Shusai then thought for three and a half hours, only to adjourn the game. It was no secret that Shusai, during adjournments, discussed and studied the game with his students to come up with the best moves. Go Seigen was therefore put into an especially adverse position for having to take on the entire Honinbo establishment.

Shusai had been trailing all throughout the match when, on the 13th day of the game, he made a brilliant move (W160) that in a single stroke brought him back into the game and guaranteed his victory. However, it was widely rumored that it was not Shusai but one of his students—Maeda Nobuaki—who authored this ingenious move. Even Maeda himself hinted that this move was indeed his idea. Years later, when presented with the opportunities to debunk this rumor, he neither confirmed nor denied it. The game became known as the game of the century.

Five years later in 1938, Go Seigen&#x27;s great friend Kitani Minoru also played a notable game against Honinbo Shusai (see &quot;The Master of Go&quot; by Yasunari Kawabata). Due in no small part to having witnessed the treatment Go Seigen received from Shusai in their previous match, Kitani Minoru demanded that the moves be sealed before each adjournment. Initially, Shusai&#x27;s camp opposed this, but Kitani vehemently insisted, and Shusai eventually gave in. Kitani won that game by a comfortable margin of five points.

==In popular culture==
In 2006, Chinese director Tian Zhuangzhuang made an award-winning biopic film about him entitled &quot;The Go Master&quot;, starring Taiwanese actor Chang Chen as Go Seigen.

In another film, &quot;An Unfinished Game&quot;, a 1982 Sino-Japanese co-production, the life of one of the characters has similarities with the life of Go Seigen. The film marked the 10th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Japan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. This film is informally known as &quot;The Go Masters&quot; in the United States, and also is award-winning.

==Rank promotion record==
==Tournament victories and runners-up==

Go was often not allowed or invited to participate in the Japanese tournaments of the day due to political reasons involving his racial background. Additionally, half of Go&#x27;s career was before the rise of title matches. As such, there are very few title or tournament victories by him. Nonetheless, his strength was most aptly demonstrated in his famed one-on-one matches with the peers of his day.

<text>This is a list of heads of state of Finland; that is, the kings of Sweden with regents and viceroys of the Kalmar Union, the grand dukes of Finland, a title used by most Swedish monarchs and Russian emperors, up to the two-year regency following the independence in 1917, with a brief flirtation with a truly domestic monarchy.

==Kingdom of Sweden (until 1809)==

&quot;Finland as an integral part of Sweden under the King of Sweden&quot;

Some texts suggest the Swedish rule of Finland started as early as during the Houses of Sverker and Eric (Sverker I of Sweden 1130–1156 and Eric the Saint 1156–1160). But the first historic documents suggesting rule by Swedish kings in Finland not limited to sparse crusades and conquests are dated at around 1249.

After the civil war, regents (valtionhoitaja) were appointed by the parliament and a new king elected.

<text>The TKO Horns were a horn section formed in 1982 when Big Jim Paterson (trombone), Paul Speare (tenor saxophone) and Brian Maurice (alto saxophone) left Dexys Midnight Runners. After a brief spell touring with Paul Young&#x27;s Q Tips they began performing on a regular basis with Elvis Costello. Another former Dexy&#x27;s sax player, Geoff Blythe, soon replaced Maurice and Dave Plews (trumpet) was added as The TKO Horns featured prominently on Costello&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Punch The Clock&quot;.

Over the next few years they performed on records by numerous other artists including Madness, Squeeze, Nick Lowe, Howard Jones and The Fixx. Paul Speare also appeared on The Special A.K.A.&#x27;s &quot;Nelson Mandela&quot; while Paterson and Blythe teamed up again in 1989 as part of a group called The Neighbourhood. More recently Blythe has been a member of Irish-American rock group Black 47.

<doc id="186986" wikidata="Q610999" url="?curid=186986" title="Dragon School">
<text>The Dragon School is a private school across two sites in Oxford, England. The Dragon Pre-Prep (children aged 4–7) and Prep School (children aged 8–13) are both co-educational schools. The Dragon Prep School was founded in 1877 as the Oxford Preparatory School. It takes day pupils and boarders.

Originally established for boys, the Dragon School also accepted a small number of day girls with a close connection to the school, first admitting girls as boarders in 1994. The school educates children aged 4 to 13 in two sites in North Oxford: Bardwell Road and Richards Lane. Boarding starts at 8 and there are 10 boarding houses, including one weekly-boarding house. Dragon Lane runs along the edge of the school immediately to the west.

==History==

The school was founded by a committee of Oxford dons, among whom the most active was a Mr George. In honour of Saint George, the group decided to call themselves Dragons.

Teaching started in September 1877 at rooms in Balliol Hall, located in St Giles&#x27;, central Oxford, under A. E. Clarke. The school expanded and moved within two years to 17 Crick Road, which became known as &quot;School House&quot;. Charles Cotterill Lynam (known as the &quot;Skipper&quot;) took over as headmaster in 1886.

In 1894, Lynam took out a lease on land at the current site at Bardwell Road in central North Oxford, just to the west of the River Cherwell. £4,000 was raised through subscriptions from local parents for the erection of new school buildings and the move was completed within a year. The school was known as Oxford Preparatory School and also Lynam&#x27;s, but gradually its current name was adopted.

The Dragon School became the second school to take part in the Harrow History Prize in 1895. Over the years, many of its pupils have won this prize, an early winner being Kit Lynam. The school was run for many years by the Lynam family.

<doc id="186987" wikidata="Q559026" url="?curid=186987" title="Ship class">
<text>A ship class is a group of ships of a similar design. This is distinct from a ship type, which might reflect a similarity of tonnage or intended use. For example, is a nuclear aircraft carrier (ship type) of the (ship class).

In the course of building a class of ships, design changes might be implemented. In such a case, the ships of different design might not be considered of the same class; each variation would either be its own class, or a subclass of the original class (see for an example). If ships are built of a class whose production had been discontinued, a similar distinction might be made.

Ships in a class often have names linked by a common factor: e.g. s&#x27; names all begin with T (, , ); and s are named after American battles (, , , ). Ships of the same class may be referred to as sister ships.

==Naval ship class naming conventions==
===Overview===
The name of a naval ship class is most commonly the name of the lead ship, the first ship commissioned or built of its design. However, other systems can be used without confusion or conflict. A descriptive name may be used; for example it was decided to group destroyers made to the same design as HMS &quot;Tomahawk&quot;, all named after weapons, as the rather than &quot;Tomahawk&quot; class.

===Europe in general===

In European navies, a class is named after the first ship commissioned regardless of when it was ordered or laid down. In some cases this has resulted in different class names being used in European and U.S. references; for example, European sources record the s of the United States Navy as the &quot;&quot;Maryland&quot; class&quot;, as was commissioned before .

===Germany===
The West German Navy (&quot;Bundesmarine&quot;) used a three-digit type number for every class in service or in advanced project state. Modified versions were identified by a single letter suffix. After the reunification of Germany the German Navy (&quot;Deutsche Marine&quot;) kept the system. Informally, classes are also traditionally named after their lead ships.
===Indonesia===
The Indonesian Navy has a traditional naming system for its ships. In addition, the ship&#x27;s type and missions can be identified by the first number on the ship&#x27;s three-digit hull number, which is placed on the front bows and the back of the stern. The naming convention is:
* Hull number beginning with 1 (reserved for aircraft carriers): ancient empires and kingdoms
* Hull number beginning with 2 (cruisers and destroyers): Indonesia&#x27;s main islands
* Hull number beginning with 3 (frigates, ocean escorts, corvettes): national heroes
* Hull number beginning with 4 (submarines, submarine tenders): mythical weapons (for submarines), National heroes (for submarine tenders)
* Hull number beginning with 5 (amphibious ships, LSTs, LPDs, LCUs, command ships): main and strategic bays (for LSTs), big cities (for LPDs), small cities (for LCUs), National figures (for command ships)
* Hull number beginning with 6 (fast attack ships): mythical weapons (previous names for missile boats), traditional weapons (current names for fast missile boats), wild animals (for fast torpedo boats)
* Hull number beginning with 7 (minesweepers, minehunters ships): every island begin with letter &quot;R&quot;, letter &quot;F&quot; (mine countermeasure vessel)
* Hull number beginning with 8 (patrol boats): native fishes and sea creatures, native snakes and wild reptiles, wild insects, geographical places (such as towns, lakes or rivers begin with &quot;si-&quot;, like &quot;Sikuda&quot;, &quot;Sigurot&quot;, &quot;Sibarau&quot;)
* Hull number beginning with 9 (supporting ships, oilers, tugs, troops transports, oceanographic research ships, sailing ships, etc.): volcanoes, cities, mythical figures, geographical capes and straits

===Russia/Soviet Union===

Russian (and Soviet) ship classes are formally named by the numbered project that designed them. That project sometimes, but not always, had a metaphorical name, and almost always had a NATO reporting name. In addition, the ships of the class would have a number prefixed by a letter indicating the role of that type of vessel. For example, Project 641 had no name, though NATO referred to its members as s.

The ship classification does not completely correspond common designation, particularly for destroyers, frigates and corvettes. Russia has its own classification system for these ships:
*Squadron Torpedo Carriers () are traditionally referred to as Destroyers (formerly torpedo boat destroyers). The Russian word for destroyer is used in the air force for fighter aircraft.
*Destroyers can also be classified as Big Anti-submarine Ships () or Big ASW Ships (e.g. Udaloy-class destroyer). They are alternatively classified as cruisers (e.g. Kara-class cruiser). The Russian Big Anti-submarine Ships type also has its sub-type of Guard (or Patrol) Ships. 
*Guard (or Patrol) Ships () are usually referred to as frigates (e.g. Gepard-class frigate).
*Another substantial type in Russia are Small Anti-submarine Ships () or Small ASW Ships. These are referred to as corvettes (e.g. Grisha-class corvette). Corvettes are also classified as Small Missile Ships (; e.g. Buyan-class corvette) or Missile Boats (; e.g. Tarantul-class corvette) in Russia.

===United Kingdom===

The British Royal Navy (RN) has used several methods of naming classes. In addition to the accepted European convention, some classes have been named after a common theme in the included ships&#x27; names, e.g., s, and some classes were implemented as an organizational tool, making traditional methods of naming inefficient. For instance, the is also known as the A class. Most destroyer classes were known by the initial letter used in naming the vessels, e.g., s. Classification by letter also helped to conflate similar smaller classes of ships as in the case of the A-class destroyers of 1913 whose names spread across the alphabet. Since the end of the Second World War, Royal Navy ship classes have also been known by their type number (e.g. Type 45 destroyer.)

===United States===
For the United States Navy, the first ship in a class to be authorized by Congress is the designated class leader and gives the name to the class, regardless of the order in which the ships of that class are laid down, launched or commissioned. Due to numbering conventions, the lead ship often has the lowest hull number of its class. (During World War II, the award of construction contracts was not always congruent with completion, so several ships had higher hull numbers than later ships.)

Before the 1920s, naval vessels were classified according to shared characteristics. 

The unofficial retro-applying of ship classes can occasionally lead to confusion. For example, while American works consistently adhere to the &quot;City&quot;- and &quot;Columbia&quot;-class monikers, works of British origin refer to the same classes as &quot;Cairo&quot; class and &quot;Tennessee&quot; class respectively, in compliance with the modern Royal Navy naming conventions.

By the time the United States entered World War II, the current naming convention was in place, though it remains unclear as to exactly how and when the practice originated.

==Merchant vessel class==
Merchant ships are almost always classed by a classification society. These vessels are said to be &quot;in class&quot; when their hull, structures, machinery, and equipment conform to International Maritime Organization and MARPOL standards. Vessels &quot;out of class&quot; may be uninsurable and/or not permitted to sail by other agencies.

A vessel&#x27;s class may include endorsements for the type of cargo such as &quot;oil carrier&quot;, &quot;bulk carrier&quot;, &quot;mixed carrier&quot; etc. It may also include class notations denoting special abilities of the vessel. Examples of this include an ice class, fire fighting capability, oil recovery capability, automated machinery space capability, or other special ability.

<doc id="186989" wikidata="Q5330714" url="?curid=186989" title="Eastlake movement">
<text>The Eastlake movement was a nineteenth-century architectural and household design reform movement started by British architect and writer Charles Eastlake (1836–1906). The movement is generally considered part of the late Victorian period in terms of broad antique furniture designations. In architecture the Eastlake style or Eastlake architecture is part of the Queen Anne style of Victorian architecture.

Eastlake&#x27;s book &quot;Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery, and Other Details&quot; posited that furniture and decor in people&#x27;s homes should be made by hand or machine workers who took personal pride in their work. Manufacturers in the United States used the drawings and ideas in the book to create mass-produced Eastlake Style or Cottage furniture.

The geometric ornaments, spindles, low relief carvings, and incised lines were designed to be affordable and easy to clean; nevertheless, many of the designs which resulted are artistically complex.

Although Charles Eastlake did not make furniture, his movement influenced the interior design of American homes with English designs that were easy to clean, functional, and simple. The ‘Eastlake’ style is of Victorian architecture and one of the core principles of this style was that Eastlake thought that the furniture in people&#x27;s homes should be good looking and be made by manufacturers who enjoyed their work. This was contrary to the previous style of furniture, with pieces that were large, heavy, and thick, and that collected dust and germs.

== History ==
Eastlake movement was named after the English architect Charles Locke Eastlake (nephew of Sir Charles Lock Eastlake) following the release of his influential book &quot;Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and Other Details&quot;. Eastlake was originally a painter who trained in Rome and was considered to have great knowledge in art however he had a specific preference.

In &quot;Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and Other Details&quot;, Eastlake promoted Victorian style furniture which had opposed the curved features of the French Baroque Revival Styles. Instead, Eastlake style had &quot;angular, notched and carved&quot; features and although he did not produce any furniture himself, cabinet makers produced them. His book influenced custom designers as well as machine-made manufacturers who Eastlake abhorred. His quote &quot;I find American tradesmen continually advertising what they are pleased to call Eastlake furniture, the production of which I have had nothing whatever to do, and for the taste of which I should be very sorry to be considered responsible&quot; shows his stance on this.

This influence later led to the Eastlake movement in the United States where Eastlake style furniture were being produced for the middle-class. It was known to be affordable while also being handcrafted and easy to clean which shows the transformative nature of Eastlake&#x27;s ideas to furniture.

== Characteristics ==
Eastlake style applied to houses as well as furniture. Characteristics of these houses include the lathe-shaped wooden forms and mechanical jigsaw wooden forms. Porch posts and railings had intricate wooden designs and curved brackets and scrolls were placed at corners. The façade also included &quot;perforated gables and pediments, carved panels and a profusion of beaded spindles, and lattice work found along porch eaves.&quot; Mansardic porches were another characteristic and had wrought iron crestings. The color combination of the houses also emphasized the contrast between the lighter colors of the details and the darker colors of the house body. In the United States, especially in California, American home builders in the 1880s replaced flat-cut gingerbread ornamental elements that were popular in the 1860s and 1870s with lathe-tuned spindlework for balusters and wall surface decoration. Charles Eastlake criticized the American adaptation as &quot;extravagant and bizarre&quot;. However, the style lived on and it was later combined with Italianate and Second Empire elements to create the &quot;San Francisco Style&quot;.

In furniture, Eastlake was particularly fond of oak and cherry wood grains; however, American manufacturers still used ebonized wood despite Eastlake&#x27;s suggestions. The forms of the furniture were often rectilinear and had &quot;geometric ornament, turnings, brackets, trestles, and incised linear decoration.&quot; Additionally, the designs were easily made by machines. Eastlake also believed that the prices of his furniture should be &quot;as cheap as that which is ugly&quot; as he could not understand why anyone would buy a more expensive piece of furniture for a more intricate design. Eastlake&#x27;s furniture was for the middle-class home, and being easy to clean was another one of the characteristics.

== Gallery ==
=== William S. Clark House ===
One example of an Eastlake movement building is William S. Clark House in Eureka, California. The house was built in 1888 and contains &quot;an elaborately decorated entrance porch, flanking square bays, side slant bays, and roof gables&quot;. Eastlake ornamentation can be seen in the bays, gables, windows, frieze, and porch. The entrance is decorated with spools, sunbursts, holes, buttons, brackets, scallops, and pierced cylinders, and is supported by large chamfered columns. The glass planes of the recessed double doors are decorated with panels above and below. The square and slant bays contain brackets, panels, moldings, and buttons. The gables contain a grillwork of stickwork, knobs, bevelled sticks, and pierced scallops that hang from the edge of the roof. The gable bracing of William S. Clark House is untraditional as most gable bracings of Eastlake Style would connect to the edge of the roof. The gable bracing instead hangs from the edge which provides shadows on the house wall. The frieze contains vertical and zigzag bevelled sticks, and pierced and chamfered brackets that surround the cornice. Below the bays, the corners of the stringcourse are filled by bevelled sunbursts. The slant bays have side porches that extend to the back of the house and there is a rear hall that connects the house with a storage/laundry annex at the back of the property. On the north side of the house, there are small, squared windows on either side of the round headed window, which create a Palladian effect.

The entrance hall, double parlors, and dining rooms are significant in that the décor and character is preserved. The unpainted windows and stairway banister have natural wood finishes that have darkened over time. The doors, stairway panels below the railing, and dining room wainscoting have the same 19th century oak graining. The wallpapers, picture railings, period furnishings, and potted ferns are in the same style as the Victorian features of the interior. In the fireplaces in the rear parlor, family room, and dining room, there are highly polished, hardwood mantels above small fireplaces. Mirrors, polished tiles, and intricate shelves extend close to the picture railing. The entrance hall stairway has a banister and a light-topped newel post leading to the second-floor hallway which is surrounded by another open-work banister. There is a contrast between the white-painted woodwork and light embossed wallpaper with the darker woodwork and paper of the parlors and dining room. The doors upstairs are painted and panelled and each has a glass of transom above. The bathroom still has an old pull-chain tank toilet and the bath has an old clawfoot tub.

=== Winters House ===
Winters House is an Eastlake movement-building in Sacramento, California and was built in 1890. It has 3 stories and is approximately 4500 square feet. Some exterior features of the house include ornamental details, such as &quot;sunburst pediments, a frieze of scrollwork sunbursts, dentil work in the gables, a mansard porch canopy, and a decorative balustrade with spindles and stick work. &quot; The house has not had any significant deviations from the original design, materials and workmanship.

The characteristics of Winters House can be seen in the &quot;steel pitched hip and gable roof, asymmetrical front façade, two-story angled bay under forward gable, mansard front porch and second story bay windows on both sides of the house&quot;. The roof of the house made of asphalt shingles and the walls are made from pattern siding covered heart redwood. The foundation of the building is a cement parged brick stem wall and the decorative brick chimneys are part of a coal burning fuel system. The interior of the house reflects the Eastlake style in the mantel spindles, the ornate tile work surrounding the two fireplaces, 12-foot second story coved ceilings and other details. The wall cladding in the main house is a horizontal shiplap with vertical lapboard. All of the windows are framed with grooved vertical moulding and other trim work, such as sunbursts above the second story windows. Below the cornice, the house also has a frieze board which includes scrollwork sunbursts and stars. In the front porch, above the front doors are cut window panels in jewel tones. The porch has a framing of fans, flowers, dentils, and spindlework. The spindlework and stickwork is repeated from the upper porch to the lower porch balustrade.

=== Thomas F. Ricks House ===
Thomas F. Ricks House is an Eastlake movement-building in Eureka, California. It was built in 1885 and in Eureka, the building is the most prominent example of Eastlake style. The building had several renovations to parts of the building, leading to the interior having a mixture of period styles. Many of the interior millwork were replaced during the hospital renovation in 1907 and in 1952 the dining room and kitchen were constructed in the style of that year. On the second floor, there are two Eastlake style bedrooms that have been unchanged.

The entry hall of Thomas F. Ricks House contains a recessed ceiling panel that is outlined with molding ornamented with modillions. A bead course is used for decoration for the staircase newel post and squared balusters have a simple railing. The entry to the living rooms are double pocket doors and the living room ceiling is surrounded with box molding and underneath it, a picture rail. The floor is a carpeted hardwood floor with a plain 12-inch baseboard and all other rooms contain the same floor and ceiling finishes with a few variations in the walls. The Victorian rooms’ surrounds had bullseye corner blocks and lower ceiling finishes. The building is unique in that in Eureka, it is the only two-story building that is symmetrical with squared bay windows. Other Eastlake features of the house include: &quot;the vertical stripes in the frieze, the brackets extending from the vertical strips, the narrow belt course, the cornice and brackets over the windows, and the wide band of trim under the cornice&quot;.

== Spread in the United States ==

Although Eastlake&#x27;s book &quot;Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and Other Details&quot; was originally released in England and was positively received, its influence was greater in the United States. The book was reprinted four times in England and six times in the United States. However, following the Civil War, the middle class desired a design reform due to the increasing awareness of the English movement. In England, Eastlake was one of many who desired a design reform, but in America his simplicity and taste were exposed to &quot;unprecedented new readers&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the home furniture was becoming simpler and that &quot;the demand for extravagant and florid goods for household use&quot; was gone.

In the nineteenth century, as machine-production became more mainstream, many household artists thought that the designs produced lacked artistic characteristics and had untraditional craftsmanship. Unlike manmade furniture, artists believed that machine-made furniture did not have holistic designs and &quot;had a basic form, a skeleton so to speak, to which various moldings and appendages of different styles were hastily applied.&quot; Eastlake, like many others, disliked the machine-produced furniture that replicated handcraftsmanship. He stated that the &quot;elaboration and finish&quot; should be a lower priority and most artists concurred that the &quot;educated ideas of construction and proportion&quot; were preferred.

One person who popularized Eastlake&#x27;s ideas was Henry Hudson Holly, an architect who wrote multiple articles using Eastlake&#x27;s book but only cited him once. Although Holly profited from Eastlake&#x27;s ideas, he echoed his ideas on furniture.

Eastlake&#x27;s book led to a demand in Eastlake furniture; however, Eastlake himself denied that there was an Eastlake style. This led to furniture manufacturers—who initially thought that Eastlake&#x27;s ideas would be more harmful than good—to invent their own Eastlake furniture, with it reaching a point that it was &quot;seen everywhere&quot;. In 1876, the Centennial Exhibition showcased Eastlake&#x27;s ideas from his book to thousands of Americans. While the ‘old’ Renaissance style was featured in most of the exhibitions, manufacturers were criticized for prioritizing profits over creating well-designed pieces of furniture. Following George W. Gay&#x27;s comment on Eastlake having &quot;far reaching influence&quot; which could be compared to the best of America&#x27;s and Europe&#x27;s manufacturers, manufacturers of cheap furniture began to use Eastlake style whereas before little attention was paid to the appearance.

Two well-known Eastlake style houses in the Los Angeles area, in Echo Park and Angelino Heights, are both on Carroll Avenue. The first is at 1330 Carroll Avenue. It was used in Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; music video, as well as in episodes of the television show &quot;Charmed&quot;, and was a focus set in the episode &quot;Size Matters&quot;.

The second house is at 1329 Carroll Avenue. The exterior of this house has been shown, in one way or another, in all 178 episodes of &quot;Charmed&quot;, through eight seasons, from 1999 to 2006. In the show the house was dubbed &quot;Halliwell Manor&quot;. The house depicted in the show shares the same house number, 1329, but is on the fictional Prescott Street in San Francisco. 

Chateau-sur-Mer, on Bellevue Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island, was altered and expanded during the Gilded Age to incorporate an Eastlake style billiard room and bedrooms.

Glenview Mansion in Yonkers, New York, also known as the John Bond Trevor Home, was completed in 1877. Glenview is now part of the Hudson River Museum and has six interpreted period rooms in the Eastlake style.

<doc id="186991" wikidata="Q132992" url="?curid=186991" title="Nectocaris">
<text>Nectocaris is a genus of squid-like animal of controversial affinities known from the Cambrian period. The initial fossils were described from the Burgess Shale of Canada. Other similar remains possibly referrable to the genus are known from the Emu Bay Shale of Australia and Chengjiang Biota of China.

&quot;Nectocaris&quot; was a free-swimming, predatory or scavenging organism. This lifestyle is reflected in its binomial name: &quot;Nectocaris&quot; means &quot;swimming shrimp&quot; (from the Ancient Greek , &#x27;, meaning &quot;swimmer&quot; and ,&#x27;, &quot;shrimp&quot;). Two morphs are known: a small morph, about an inch long, and a large morph, anatomically identical but around four times longer.

Nectocaridids have controversial affinities. Some authors have suggested that they represent the earliest known cephalopods. However, their morphology is strongly dissimilar to confirmed early cephalopods, and thus their affinities to cephalopods and even to molluscs more broadly are rejected by most authors. Their affinities to any animal group beyond Bilateria are uncertain, though they have been suggested to be members of Lophotrochozoa.

The closely related Ordovician taxon &quot;Nectocotis&quot; is a second genus, closely resembling &quot;Nectocaris&quot;, but suggested to have had an internal skeletal element.

== Anatomy ==

&quot;Nectocaris&quot; had a flattened, kite-shaped body with a fleshy fin running along the length of each side. The small head had two stalked eyes, a single pair of tentacles, and a flexible funnel-shaped structure opening out to the underside of the body. The funnel often gets wider away from the head. The funnel has been suggested to represent an eversible (able to be turned inside out) pharynx. Internally, a long cavity runs along the body axis, which is suggested to represent the digestive tract. The body contains a pair of gills; the gills comprise blades emerging from a zig-zag axis. Muscle blocks surrounded the axial cavity, and are now preserved as dark blocks in the lateral body. The fins also show dark blocks, with fine striations superimposed over them. These striations often stand in high relief above the rock surface itself.

== Diversity ==
Although &quot;Nectocaris&quot; is known from Canada, China and Australia, in rocks spanning some 20 million years, there does not seem to be much diversity; size excepted, all specimens are anatomically very similar. Historically, three genera have been erected for nectocaridid taxa from different localities, but these &#x27;species&#x27; – &quot;Petalilium latus&quot; and &quot;Vetustovermis planus&quot; – likely belong to the same genus or even the same species as &quot;N. pteryx&quot;. Within &quot;N. pteryx&quot;, there seem to be two discrete morphs, one large (~10 cm in length), one small (~3 cm long). These perhaps represent separate male and female forms.

== Ecology ==

The unusual shape of the nectocaridid funnel has led to its interpretation as an eversible proboscis. Martin R. Smith and Jean-Bernard Caron have suggested that it was used for jet propulsion, though this has been questioned by other authors. The eyes of &quot;Nectocaris&quot; would have had a similar visual acuity to modern &quot;Nautilus&quot; (if they lacked a lens) or squid (if they did not). They are thought to have been freely-swimming nektonic organisms, that were either scavengers or predators on soft-bodied animals, using their tentacles to manipulate food items.

== Affinity ==
The affinity of &quot;Nectocaris&quot; is controversial. Martin R. Smith and Jean-Bernard Caron have suggested that nectocaridids represent early cephalopods. In a 2010 publication in Nature, they suggested that the ancestor of modern cephalopods and nectocaridids probably lacked a mineralised shell, while Smith in a later 2013 publication suggested that it may be more plausible that nectocaridids had instead lost a mineralised shell and developed a morphology convergent on modern coleoids. However, other authors contend that the morphology of nectocaridids is contrary to what is known about cephalopod and mollusc evolution, and they cannot be accommodated within these groups, and can only be confidently placed as members of Bilateria.

==History of study==
&quot;Nectocaris&quot; has a long and convoluted history of study. Charles Doolittle Walcott, the discoverer of the Burgess Shale, had photographed the one specimen he had collected in the 1910s, but never had time to investigate it further. As such, it was not until 1976 that &quot;Nectocaris&quot; was formally described, by Simon Conway Morris.

Because the genus was originally known from a single, incomplete specimen and with no counterpart, Conway Morris was unable to deduce its affinity. It had some features which were reminiscent of arthropods, but these could well have been convergently derived. Its fins were very unlike those of arthropods.

Working from photographs, the Italian palaeontologist Alberto Simonetta believed he could classify &quot;Nectocaris&quot; within the chordates. He focussed mainly on the tail and fin morphology, interpreting Conway Morris&#x27;s &#x27;gut&#x27; as a notochord – a distinctive chordate feature.

The classification of &quot;Nectocaris&quot; was revisited in 2010, when Martin Smith and Jean-Bernard Caron described 91 additional specimens, many of them better preserved than the type. These allowed them to reinterpret &quot;Nectocaris&quot; as a primitive cephalopod, with only 2 tentacles instead of the 8 or 10 limbs of modern cephalopods. The structure previous researchers had identified as an oval carapace or shield behind the eyes was suggested to be a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods. The interpretation would push back the origin of cephalopods by at least 30 million years, much closer to the first appearance of complex animals, in the Cambrian explosion, and implied that – against the widespread expectation – cephalopods evolved from non-mineralized ancestors.

Later independent analyses questioned the cephalopod interpretation, stating that it did not square with the established theory of cephalopod evolution, and that nectocaridids should be considered &quot;incertae sedis&quot; among Bilateria.

===&quot;Vetustovermis&quot;===
Vetustovermis (from Latin: &quot;very old worm&quot;) is a soft-bodied middle Cambrian animal, known from a single reported fossil specimen from the South Australian Emu Bay shale. It is probably a junior synonym of &quot;Nectocaris pteryx&quot;.

The original description of &quot;Vetustovermis&quot; hedged its bets regarding classification, but tentatively highlighted some similarities with the annelid worms. It was later considered an arthropod, and in 2010 Smith and Caron, agreeing that &quot;Petalilium&quot; was at least a close relative of &quot;Vetustovermis&quot; (but that treating it as a synonym was premature, given the poor preservation of the &quot;Vetustovermis&quot; type), placed it with &quot;Nectocaris&quot; in the clade Nectocarididae.

Early press reports misspelled the genus name as &quot;Vetustodermis&quot;.

===&quot;Petalilium&quot;===

Petalilium (sometimes misspelled Petalium) is an enigmatic genus of Cambrian organism known from the Haikou area, from the Maotianshan mudstone member of the Chengjiang biota. The taxon is a junior synonym of &quot;Nectocaris pteryx&quot;.

Fossils of &quot;Petalilium&quot; show a dorsoventrally flattened body, usually 5 to 6 centimetres, but ranging from 1.5 to 10 cm. It has an ovate trunk region and a large muscular foot, and a head with stalked eyes and a pair of long tentacles. The trunk region possesses about 50 soft, flexible, transverse bars, lateral serialised structures of unknown function. The upper part of the body, interpreted as a mantle, is covered with a random array of spines on the back, while gills project underneath. A complete, tubular gut runs the length of the body.

Whilst it was originally described as a phyllocarid, and a ctenophore affinity has been suggested, neither interpretation is supported by any compelling evidence.

Some of the characters observed in Chen &quot;et al&quot;.&#x27;s (2005) study suggested that &quot;Petalilium&quot; may be related to &quot;Nectocaris&quot;.

<doc id="187010" wikidata="Q4341553" url="?curid=187010" title="Pinocchio (1940 film)">
<text>Pinocchio is a 1940 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. Loosely based on Carlo Collodi&#x27;s 1883 Italian children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, it is the studio&#x27;s second animated feature film, as well as the third animated film overall produced by an American film studio, after Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) and Fleischer Studios&#x27; &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1939).

With the voices of Cliff Edwards, Dickie Jones, Christian Rub, Walter Catlett, Charles Judels, Evelyn Venable, and Frankie Darro, the film follows a wooden puppet, Pinocchio, who is created by an old woodcarver, Geppetto, and brought to life by a blue fairy. Wishing to become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself to be &quot;brave, truthful, and unselfish.&quot; Along his journey, Pinocchio encounters several characters representing the temptations and consequences of wrongdoing, as a cricket named Jiminy, who takes the role of Pinocchio&#x27;s conscience, attempts to guide him in matters of right and wrong.

The film was adapted by several storyboard artists from Collodi&#x27;s book. The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske, and the film&#x27;s sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, and Bill Roberts. &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles and machinery as well as natural elements such as rain, water, lightning, smoke, and shadow. After premiering at the Center Theatre in New York City on February 7, 1940, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was released in theatres on February 23, 1940.

Although it received critical acclaim and became the first animated feature to win a competitive Academy Award – winning two for Best Music, Original Score and for Best Music, Original Song for &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; – it was initially a commercial failure, mainly due to World War II cutting off the European and Asian markets. It eventually made a profit after its 1945 rerelease, and is considered one of the greatest animated films ever made, with a rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes. The film and characters are still prevalent in popular culture, featuring at various Disney parks and other forms of entertainment. In 1994, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was added to the United States National Film Registry for being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

In 2000, a live-action made-for-television semi-remake and musical film titled &quot;Geppetto&quot;, told from Geppetto&#x27;s perspective, was released via ABC. A live-action remake of the same title directed by Robert Zemeckis was released in 2022 on Disney+.

== Plot ==
In late-19th century Italy, Jiminy Cricket arrives at the shop of a woodworker and toymaker named Geppetto, who creates a puppet he names Pinocchio. As he falls asleep, Geppetto wishes upon a star for Pinocchio to be a real boy. Late that night, the Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself to be brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy. When Jiminy reveals himself, the Blue Fairy assigns him to be Pinocchio&#x27;s conscience. Geppetto awakens upon hearing the commotion from Pinocchio falling, and is overjoyed to discover that he is alive and will become a real boy.

The next morning, while walking to school, Pinocchio is led astray by con artist fox Honest John and his sidekick Gideon the Cat. Honest John convinces him to join Stromboli&#x27;s puppet show, despite Jiminy&#x27;s protestations. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli&#x27;s star attraction, but when he tries to go home, Stromboli locks him in a bird cage and leaves to tour the world with Pinocchio. After Jiminy unsuccessfully tries to free his friend, the Blue Fairy appears, and an anxious Pinocchio lies about what happened, causing his nose to grow and become a tree branch with a bird&#x27;s nest. The Blue Fairy restores his nose and frees Pinocchio when he promises to make amends, but warns him that she can offer no further help.

Meanwhile, a mysterious Coachman hires Honest John to find disobedient and naughty boys for him to take to Pleasure Island, a notorious and infamous place. Honest John, despite the legal risks and the Coachman&#x27;s implication of what happens to the boys, accepts the job out of fear, and finds Pinocchio, persuading him to take a vacation on Pleasure Island. On the way to the island, Pinocchio befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. At Pleasure Island, without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio, Lampwick, and many other boys soon engage in vices such as vandalism, fighting, smoking and drinking. Jiminy eventually finds Pinocchio in a bar smoking and playing pool with Lampwick, and the two have a falling out after Pinocchio defends Lampwick for his actions. As Jiminy tries leaving Pleasure Island, he discovers that the island hides a horrible curse that transforms the boys into donkeys after making &quot;jackasses&quot; of themselves, and they are sold by the Coachman into slave labor. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick transform into a donkey, and with Jiminy&#x27;s help, he flees before he can be fully transformed, though he still has a donkey&#x27;s ears and tail.

Upon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find Geppetto&#x27;s workshop deserted, and obtain a letter from the Blue Fairy in the form of a dove, stating that Geppetto had sailed to Pleasure Island in search of Pinocchio. He was swallowed by a gigantic and vicious sperm whale called Monstro and is now trapped in its belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the Mediterranean Sea with Jiminy and is soon swallowed by Monstro, where he reunites with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze and allow them to escape, but the whale chases them and destroys their raft with his tail. Pinocchio selflessly pulls Geppetto to safety in a cove just as Monstro crashes into it and Pinocchio is killed.

Back at home, Geppetto, Jiminy, Figaro, and Cleo mourn Pinocchio. Having succeeded in proving himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, Pinocchio is revived and turned into a real human boy by the Blue Fairy, much to everyone&#x27;s joy. As the group celebrates, Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.

* Clarence Nash as Figaro, Geppetto&#x27;s pet cat who is prone to sulk. Cleo, Geppetto&#x27;s pet goldfish with a habit of being Figaro&#x27;s counselor, is unvoiced. Figaro and Cleo were original characters not present in the original story, and were added to the script by the Disney team. Nash also voices the rough house statue and makes the braying sounds for the donkeys on Pleasure Island, after the boys have been transformed into them.
* Walter Catlett as &quot;Honest&quot; John Worthington Foulfellow, an anthropomorphic red fox con artist who swindles Pinocchio.
** Gideon the Cat, Honest John&#x27;s mute anthropomorphic feline partner and sidekick who serves as comic relief. He was originally intended to be voiced by Mel Blanc, in his second work for Disney until his final work in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but the filmmakers instead went with a mute performance for the character. However, Gideon&#x27;s hiccups were provided by Blanc.
* Charles Judels as Stromboli, a puppeteer who buys Pinocchio for a miserable amount of money from Honest John &amp; Gideon and intends to force said Pinocchio to perform onstage to make money and use as &quot;firewood&quot; once he gets &quot;too old&quot; to perform. He speaks English with an Italian accent, and curses in Italian gibberish when angry. He is called &quot;gypsy&quot; by Honest John, likely due to his theatre and caravan always travelling, as well as other names like &quot;rascal&quot; and &quot;faker&quot;.
** Judels also voiced the Coachman, the owner and operator of Pleasure Island with a Cockney accent.
* Evelyn Venable as the Blue Fairy, who brings Pinocchio to life and promises to turn him into a real boy if he proves himself brave, truthful, and selfless. Live-action references for the Blue Fairy were provided by Marge Champion, who served as the live-action reference for the titular heroine in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;.
* Frankie Darro as Lampwick, a boy whom Pinocchio befriends on his way to Pleasure Island and is turned into a donkey for his mischief.
* Stuart Buchanan as the Carnival Barker, the announcer at Pleasure Island. In a book adaptation of the film, &quot;Barker&quot; is the Coachman&#x27;s name or alias.
* Thurl Ravenscroft as Monstro, the sperm whale. He swallows Pinocchio, Geppetto, Figaro, and Cleo, then tries to kill them after they escape from his belly by making him sneeze.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
In September 1937, during the production of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, animator Norman Ferguson brought a translated version of Carlo Collodi&#x27;s 1883 Italian children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; to the attention of Walt Disney. After reading the book, &quot;Walt was busting his guts with enthusiasm,&quot; as Ferguson later recalled. Disney then commissioned storyboard artist Bianca Majolie to write a new story outline for the book, but after reading it, he felt her outline was too faithful. &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was intended to be the studio&#x27;s third feature, after &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942). However, due to difficulties with &quot;Bambi&quot; (adapting the story and animating the animals realistically), Disney announced that &quot;Bambi&quot; would be postponed while &quot;Pinocchio&quot; would move ahead in production. Ben Sharpsteen was then re-assigned to supervise the production while Jack Kinney was given directional reins.

=== Writing and design ===
Unlike &quot;Snow White&quot;, which was a short story that the writers could expand and experiment with, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was based on a novel with a very fixed, although episodic, story. Therefore, the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation. In the original novel, Pinocchio is a cold, rude, ungrateful, inhuman brat that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons the hard way. The writers decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen&#x27;s dummy Charlie McCarthy, but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book. The story was still being developed in the early stages of animation.

Early scenes animated by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio&#x27;s design was exactly like a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap, and bare wooden hands. Disney, however, was not impressed with the work that was being done on the film. He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production. Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing, but the design still retained a wooden feel.

Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas, Johnston, and Moore were &quot;rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet&quot; and felt that they should &quot;forget that he was a puppet and get a cute little boy; you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards.&quot; Co-supervising director Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence.

Kahl then showed Disney an animation test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father. From this scene, Kahl re-envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy, with a child&#x27;s Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four-fingered (or three and a thumb) hands with Mickey Mouse-type gloves. The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms, legs, and little button wooden nose. Disney embraced Kahl&#x27;s scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent, naïve, somewhat coy personality reflecting Kahl&#x27;s design.

However, Disney discovered that the new Pinocchio was too helpless and was far too often led astray by deceiving characters. Therefore, in the summer of 1938, Disney and his story team established the character of the cricket. Originally, the talking cricket was only a minor character whom Pinocchio abruptly killed by squashing with a mallet and who later returned as a ghost. Disney dubbed the cricket &quot;Jiminy&quot;, and made him a character who would try to guide Pinocchio into the right decisions. Once the character was expanded, he was depicted as a realistic cricket with toothed legs and waving antennae, but Disney wanted something more likable. Ward Kimball had spent several months animating two sequences—a soup-eating musical number and a bed-building sequence—in &quot;Snow White&quot;, which was cut from the film due to pacing reasons. Kimball was about to quit when Disney rewarded him for his work by promoting him to the supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket. Kimball then conjured up the design for Jiminy Cricket, whom he described as a little man with an egg head and no ears. Jiminy &quot;was a cricket because we called him a cricket,&quot; Kimball later joked.

=== Casting ===

Due to the huge success of &quot;Snow White&quot;, Walt Disney wanted more famous voices for &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, which marked the first time an animated film had used celebrities as voice actors. He cast popular singer Cliff Edwards, also known as &quot;Ukulele Ike&quot;, as Jiminy Cricket. Disney rejected the idea of having an adult play Pinocchio and insisted that the character be voiced by a real child. He cast 11-year-old child actor Dickie Jones, who had previously been in Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939). He also cast Frankie Darro as Lampwick, Walter Catlett as &quot;Honest&quot; John Foulfellow the Fox, Evelyn Venable as the Blue Fairy, Charles Judels as both the villainous Stromboli and the Coachman, and Christian Rub as Geppetto, whose design was even a caricature of Rub. Another actor voiced Geppetto originally, but Disney recast him with Rub after feeling that his voice was &quot;too harsh&quot;.

Another voice actor recruited was Mel Blanc, best remembered for voicing many of the characters in Warner Bros. cartoon shorts, including &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;. Blanc recorded the voice of Gideon the Cat in sixteen days. However, it was eventually decided that Gideon would be mute, so all of Blanc&#x27;s recorded dialogue was subsequently deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard three times in the finished film.

=== Animation ===

Animation on the film began in January 1938, but work on Pinocchio&#x27;s animation was discontinued as the writers sought to re-work his characterization and the film&#x27;s narrative structure. However, animation on the film&#x27;s supporting characters started in April 1938. Animation would not resume again with the revised story until September.

During the production of the film, story artist Joe Grant formed a character model department, which would be responsible for building three-dimensional clay models of the characters in the film, known as maquettes. These models were then given to the staff to observe how a character should be drawn from any given angle desired by the artists. The model makers also built working models of Geppetto&#x27;s elaborate cuckoo clocks designed by Albert Hurter, as well as Stromboli&#x27;s gypsy wagon and wooden cage, and the Coachman&#x27;s carriage. However, owing to the difficulty of animating a realistic moving vehicle, the artists filmed the carriage maquettes on a miniature set using stop motion animation. Then, each frame of the animation was transferred onto animation cels using an early version of a Xerox. The cels were then painted on the back and overlaid on top of background images with the cels of the characters to create the completed shot on the rostrum camera. Like &quot;Snow White&quot;, live-action footage was shot for &quot;Pinocchio&quot; with the actors playing the scenes in pantomime, supervised by Luske. Rather than tracing, which would result in stiff unnatural movement, the animators used the footage as a guide for animation by studying human movement and then incorporating some poses into the animation (though slightly exaggerated).

&quot;Pinocchio&quot; was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, led by Joshua Meador. In contrast to the character animators who concentrate on the acting of the characters, effects animators create everything that moves other than the characters—vehicles, machinery, and natural effects such as rain, lightning, snow, smoke, shadows and water, as well as the fantasy or science-fiction type effects like the pixie dust of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953). The influential abstract animator Oskar Fischinger, who mainly worked on &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), contributed to the effects animation of the Blue Fairy&#x27;s wand. Effects animator Sandy Strother kept a diary about his year-long animation of the water effects, which included splashes, ripples, bubbles, waves, and the illusion of being underwater. To help give depth to the ocean, the animators put more detail into the waves on the water surface in the foreground, and put in less detail as the surface moved further back. After the animation was traced onto cels, the assistant animators would trace it once more with blue and black pencil leads to give the waves a sculptured look. To save time and money, the splashes were kept impressionistic. These techniques enabled &quot;Pinocchio&quot; to be one of the first animated films to have highly realistic effects animation. Ollie Johnston called it &quot;one of the finest things the studio&#x27;s ever done, as Frank Thomas said, &#x27;The water looks so real a person can drown in it, and they do.&#x27;&quot;

== Music ==

The songs in &quot;Pinocchio&quot; were composed by Leigh Harline with lyrics by Ned Washington. Harline and Paul J. Smith composed the incidental music score. The climactic Whale Chase was co-composed by Edward H. Plumb. The soundtrack was first released on February 9, 1940. Jiminy Cricket&#x27;s song, &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot;, became a major hit and is still identified with the film, and later as the theme song of The Walt Disney Company itself. The soundtrack won an Academy Award for Best Original Score.

== Themes ==
M. Keith Booker considers the film to be the most down-to-earth of the Disney animated films despite its theme song and magic, and notes that the film&#x27;s protagonist has to work to prove his worth, which he remarked seemed &quot;more in line with the ethos of capitalism&quot; than most of the Disney films. Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh believe that the male protagonists of films like &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942) were purposefully constructed by Disney to appeal to both boys and girls. Mark I. Pinsky said that it is &quot;a simple morality tale—cautionary and schematic—ideal for moral instruction, save for some of its darker moments&quot;, and noted that the film is a favorite of parents of young children.

Nicolas Sammond argues that the film is &quot;an apt metaphor for the metaphysics of midcentury American child-rearing&quot; and that the film is &quot;ultimately an assimilationist fable&quot;. He considered it to be the central Disney film and the most strongly middle class, intended to relay the message that indulging in &quot;the pleasures of the working class, of vaudeville, or of pool halls and amusement parks, led to a life as a beast of burden&quot;. For Sammond, the purpose of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; is to help convey to children the &quot;middle-class virtues of deferred gratification, self-denial, thrift, and perseverance, naturalized as the experience of the most average American&quot;.

Author and illustrator Maurice Sendak, who saw the film in theaters in 1940, called the film superior to Collodi&#x27;s novel in its depiction of children and growing up. &quot;The Pinocchio in the film is not the unruly, sulking, vicious, devious (albeit still charming) marionette that Collodi created. Neither is he an innately evil, doomed-to-calamity child of sin. He is, rather, both lovable and loved. Therein lies Disney&#x27;s triumph. His Pinocchio is a mischievous, innocent and very naive little wooden boy. What makes our anxiety over his fate endurable is a reassuring sense that Pinocchio is loved for himself – and not for what he should or shouldn&#x27;t be. Disney has corrected a terrible wrong. Pinocchio, he says, is good; his &quot;badness&quot; is only a matter of inexperience,&quot; and also that &quot;Pinocchio&#x27;s wish to be a real boy remains the film&#x27;s underlying theme, but &quot;becoming a real boy&quot; now signifies the wish to grow up, not the wish to be good.&quot;

Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson has spoken about the film in his lectures extensively, citing it as an example of &quot;the manner in which great mythological and archetypal themes inform and permeate narrative.&quot;

== Home media ==
On July 16, 1985, it was released on VHS, Betamax, CED, and LaserDisc in North America for the first time as part of the Walt Disney Classics label, the second title with the Classics label after &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973) which was released the previous December. It would become the best-selling home video title of the year selling 130–150,000 units at $80 each. It was re-issued on October 14, 1986 to advertise the home video debut of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959), this release also helped leave out the preview of &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; from the original 1985 VHS release due to the preview being too dark and scary for kids. Then, for the first time, it was released on VHS in the UK in 1988, 1995, and 2000. The digital restoration that was completed for the 1992 cinema re-issue was released on VHS and Laserdisc on March 26, 1993 and sold 13.5 million copies. Its fourth VHS release and first release on Disney DVD was the 60th Anniversary Edition released on October 25, 1999. For this version, both releases would now be THX certified.

The film was re-issued on DVD and one final time on VHS as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection release on March 7, 2000. Along the film, the VHS edition also contained a making-of documentary while the DVD had the film&#x27;s original theatrical trailer as supplemental features. The Gold Classic Collection release was returned to the Disney Vault on January 31, 2002.

A special edition VHS and DVD of the film was released in the United Kingdom on March 3, 2003. The fourth DVD release and first Blu-ray Disc release (the second Blu-ray in the Walt Disney Platinum Editions series) was the 70th Anniversary Edition released on March 10, 2009. Like the 2008 &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; Blu-ray release, the &quot;Pinocchio&quot; Blu-ray package featured a new restoration by Lowry Digital in a two-disc Blu-ray set, with a bonus DVD version of the film also included. This set returned to the Disney Vault on April 30, 2011. A Signature Edition was released on Digital HD on January 10, 2017 and was followed by a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack on January 31, 2017.

== Reception ==
=== Initial release ===
Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film five out of five stars, saying &quot;&quot;Pinocchio&quot; is here at last, is every bit as fine as we had prayed it would be—if not finer—and that it is as gay and clever and delightful a fantasy as any well-behaved youngster or jaded oldster could hope to see.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine gave the film a positive review, stating &quot;In craftsmanship and delicacy of drawing and coloring, in the articulation of its dozens of characters, in the greater variety and depth of its photographic effects, it tops the high standard &quot;Snow White&quot; set. The charm, humor and loving care with which it treats its inanimate characters puts it in a class by itself.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; praised the animation as superior to &quot;Snow White&quot;″s writing the &quot;[a]nimation is so smooth that cartoon figures carry impression of real persons and settings rather than drawings to onlooker.&quot; In summary, they felt &quot;Pinocchio&quot; &quot;will stand on [its] own as a substantial piece of entertainment for young and old, providing attention through its perfection in animation and photographic effects. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Pinocchio&quot; is entertainment for every one of every age, so completely charming and delightful that there is profound regret when it reaches the final fade-out. Since comparisons will be inevitable, it may as well be said at once that, from a technical standpoint, conception and production, this picture is infinitely superior to &quot;Snow White&quot;.&quot;

=== Box office ===
At first, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was not a box-office success. The box office returns from the film&#x27;s initial release were both below &quot;Snow White&#x27;s&quot; unprecedented success and below studio expectations. Of the film&#x27;s $2.6 million negative cost—twice the cost of &quot;Snow White&quot;—Disney only recouped $1 million by late 1940, with studio reports of the film&#x27;s final original box office take varying between $1.4 million and $1.9 million. Animation historian Michael Barrier notes that &quot;Pinocchio&quot; returned rentals of less than one million by September 1940, and in its first public annual report, Walt Disney Productions charged off a $1 million loss to the film. Barrier relays that a 1947 &quot;Pinocchio&quot; balance sheet listed total receipts to the studio of $1.4 million. This was primarily due to the fact that World War II and its aftermath had cut off the European and Asian markets overseas, and hindered the international success of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and other Disney releases during the early and mid-1940s. Joe Grant recalled Walt Disney being &quot;very, very depressed&quot; about &quot;Pinocchio&#x27;s&quot; initial returns at the box office. The distributor RKO recorded a loss of $94,000 for the film from worldwide rentals of $3,238,000.

=== Accolades ===
The film was nominated and won two Academy Awards in 1940 for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (for &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;), the first Disney film to win either category. &lt;br&gt; To date, only six other Disney films have made this achievement: &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995).

=== Reissues ===
With the re-release of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in 1944 came the tradition of re-releasing Disney films every seven to ten years. &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was theatrically re-released in 1945, 1954, 1962, 1971, 1978, 1984, and 1992. RKO handled the first two reissues in 1945 and 1954, while Disney itself reissued the film from 1962 on through its Buena Vista Distribution division. The 1992 re-issue was digitally restored by cleaning and removing scratches from the original negatives one frame at a time, eliminating soundtrack distortions, and revitalizing the color.

Despite its initial struggles at the box office, a series of reissues in the years after World War II proved more successful and allowed the film to turn a profit. By 1973, the film had earned rentals of $13 million in the United States and Canada from the initial 1940 release and four reissues. After the 1978 reissue, the rentals had increased to $19.9 million from a total gross of $39 million. The 1984 reissue grossed $26.4 million in the U.S. and Canada, bringing its total gross there to $65.4 million and $145 million worldwide. The 1992 reissue grossed $18.9 million in the U.S. and Canada bringing &quot;Pinocchio&quot;&#x27;s lifetime gross to $84.3 million at the U.S. and Canadian box office.

=== Modern acclaim ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The general consensus of the film on the site is &quot;Ambitious, adventurous, and sometimes frightening, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; arguably represents the pinnacle of Disney&#x27;s collected works – it&#x27;s beautifully crafted and emotionally resonant.&quot;. On Metacritic, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; has a weighted score of 99 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. It is currently the highest-rated animated film on the site, as well as the highest-rated Disney animated film.

Many film historians consider this to be the film that most closely approaches technical perfection of all the Disney animated features. Film critic Leonard Maltin said, &quot;with &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, Disney reached not only the height of his powers, but the apex of what many critics consider to be the realm of the animated cartoon.&quot;

In 1994, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Filmmaker Terry Gilliam selected it as one of the ten best animated films of all time in a 2001 article written for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and in 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named it one of the 100 best films of the last 80 years, and then in June 2011 named it the best animated movie of &quot;The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films&quot;.

In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;Ten top Ten&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was acknowledged as the second best film in the medium of animation, after &quot;Snow White&quot;. It was nominated for the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies,
and received further nominations for their Thrills and Heroes and Villains (Stromboli in the villains category) lists. The song &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot; ranked number 7 on their 100 Songs list, and the film ranked 38th in the 100 Cheers list. The quote &quot;A lie keeps growing and growing until it&#x27;s as plain as the nose on your face&quot; was nominated for the Movie Quotes list, and the film received further nomination in the AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals list.

On June 29, 2018, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; was named the 13th best Disney animated film by IGN. Film critic Roger Ebert, adding it to his list of &quot;Great Movies&quot;, wrote that the movie &quot;isn&#x27;t just a concocted fable or a silly fairy tale, but a narrative with deep archetypal reverberations.&quot; In November 2024, &quot;IndieWire&quot; listed it first in its ranking of every Walt Disney Animation Studios film. Writer Christian Blauvelt elaborated: &quot;This is not a film you&#x27;ll ever fully wrap your head around, never &#x27;solve&#x27;, never stop finding things to wonder at. It&#x27;s a singular work of depth and ambition, the kind that all artists would aspire to from the core of their being.&quot;

== Legacy ==
After the film, Jiminy Cricket became an iconic Disney character, making numerous other appearances in a major role, including the film &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot; (1947), educational serials from &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; (1955–1977), the featurette &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983), and the video game &quot;Disney&#x27;s Villains&#x27; Revenge&quot; (1999).

Figaro, Geppetto&#x27;s kitten, primarily animated by Eric Larson, has been described as a &quot;hit with the audiences&quot;, which resulted in him making appearances in several subsequent Disney short films in the 1940s. He continues to appear in multiple media, mostly as the pet of Minnie Mouse.

The Blue Fairy is the main character in the prequel novel &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; which is mostly set 40 years prior to the events of the film. It was written by Elizabeth Lim and published on April 4, 2023 as part of Disney&#x27;s &quot;A Twisted Tale&quot; anthology series. The story details her origins as Chiara Belmagio, a baker&#x27;s eldest daughter and philanthropist in the small Italian town of Pariva, her complex relationship with her narcissistic younger sister Ilaria and her eventual transformation into a fairy.

Many of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;″s characters are costumed characters at Disney parks. Pinocchio&#x27;s Daring Journey is a popular ride at the original Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Park in Paris. Pinocchio Village Haus is a quick service restaurant at Walt Disney World that serves pizza and macaroni and cheese. There are similar quick-service restaurants at the Disneyland parks in Anaheim and Paris as well, with almost identical names.

&quot;Disney on Ice&quot; starring &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, toured internationally from 1987 to 1992. A shorter version of the story is also presented in the current Disney on Ice production &quot;One Hundred Years of Magic&quot;.

Like other Walt Disney Animation Studios characters, the characters from &quot;Pinocchio&quot; have cameo appearances in the short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; (2023).

=== Cancelled sequel ===
In the mid-2000s, Disneytoon Studios began development on a direct-to-video sequel to &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Robert Reece co-wrote the film&#x27;s screenplay, which saw Pinocchio on a &quot;strange journey&quot; for the sake of something dear to him. &quot;It&#x27;s a story that leads Pinocchio to question why life appears unfair sometimes,&quot; said Reece. John Lasseter cancelled &quot;Pinocchio II&quot; soon after being named Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios in 2006.

===Live-action adaptations===
==== &quot;Geppetto&quot; ====

A Disney&#x27;s made-for-television movie titled &quot;Geppetto&quot; was released in 2000. It was based on a book by David Stern, which was a re-telling of the original 1883 original Pinocchio book but told from Geppetto&#x27;s perspective. While not a direct adaptation of the 1940 animated film, it features few commons elements such as the character of Figaro, the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Got No Strings&quot;, and Pleasure Island. It stars Drew Carey as Geppetto and Seth Adkins as Pinocchio, and features music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.

The movie was in turn adapted into a musical, &quot;Disney&#x27;s My Son Pinocchio: Geppetto&#x27;s Musical Tale&quot;, which premiered at The Coterie Theatre, Kansas City, Missouri in 2006.

==== 2022 remake ====

A live-action adaptation directed by Robert Zemeckis who also co-produced and co-written with Chris Weitz, and stars Tom Hanks as Geppetto, Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Pinocchio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jiminy Cricket, Cynthia Erivo as the Blue Fairy, Keegan-Michael Key as Honest John, Luke Evans as the Coachman and Lorraine Bracco as a new character named Sofia the Seagull. The film was released to the streaming service Disney+ on September 8, 2022.

=== In other media ===
The &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; Sunday comic strip published an adaptation of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; from December 24, 1939 to April 7, 1940. The sequences were scripted by Merrill De Maris and drawn by Hank Porter.

==== Video games ====
Aside from the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Boy, and SNES games based on the animated film, the characters appear in several Disney video games.

Jiminy Cricket appears as a main character in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Villains&#x27; Revenge&quot;, being player&#x27;s guide during the progress of the game.

In the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, Jiminy Cricket appears acting as a recorder, keeping a journal of the game&#x27;s progress in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, and &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;. Pinocchio, Geppetto and Cleo also appear as characters in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. and the inside of Monstro is also featured as one of the worlds. Pinocchio&#x27;s home world was slated to appear in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;, but was omitted due to time restrictions, although talk-sprites of Pinocchio, Geppetto, Honest John and Gideon have been revealed. As compensation, this world appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;, under the name &quot;Prankster&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, with Dream world versions of Pinocchio, Jiminy Cricket, Geppetto, Monstro and the Blue Fairy appearing.

Pinocchio, Jiminy Cricket, Geppetto, Figaro, the Blue Fairy, Honest John and Stromboli appear as playable characters in the video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, along with some attractions based on locations of the film. Monstro also appeared temporarily as a non-player character for a Boss Battle during the limited time &quot;&quot;Pinocchio&quot; Event&quot; in which the characters and material related to the film were included. In the game, the characters are involved in new storylines that serve as a continuation of the film.

<text>And/or is an English grammatical conjunction used to indicate that &quot;one, more, or all&quot; of the cases it connects may occur. It is used as an inclusive &quot;or&quot; (as in logic and mathematics), because saying &quot;or&quot; in spoken or written English might be inclusive or exclusive.

The construction has been used in official, legal, and business documents since the mid-19th century, and evidence of broader use appears in the 20th century. It has been criticized as both ugly in style—by many style guides, including the classic &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; (from William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White)—and ambiguous in legal documents—by American and British courts.

== Alternatives ==
Two alternatives have been proposed. The first, when used for just two items, is to replace &quot;&quot;x&quot; and/or &quot;y&quot; with &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot; or both.&quot; The second is to simply choose which of &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot; to use.

== Mutual exclusivity ==
The word &quot;or&quot; does not entail mutual exclusivity by itself. The word &quot;either&quot; can be used to convey mutual exclusivity. &quot;When using &quot;either&quot; as a conjunction, [it can be applied] to more than two elements in a series.&quot; Thus,

appropriately indicates that the choices are mutually exclusive. If the function of &quot;or&quot; is clear from the context, it is not necessary to use &quot;either&quot; as a conjunction:

== Criticism ==
References on English usage strongly criticize the phrase as &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;Janus-faced&quot;. William Strunk, Jr., and E.B. White, in their classic &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;–recognized by &quot;Time&quot; one of the 100 best and most influential non-fiction books written in English since 1923, say &quot;and/or&quot; is &quot;A device, or shortcut, that damages a sentence and often leads to confusion or ambiguity&quot;. Roy H. Copperud, in &quot;A Dictionary of Usage and Style&quot;, says that the phrase is &quot;Objectionable to many, who regard it as a legalism&quot;.

===Legal criticism===
The phrase has come under criticism in both American and British courts. Judges have called it a &quot;freakish fad&quot;, an &quot;accuracy-destroying symbol&quot;, and &quot;meaningless&quot;. In a Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion from 1935, Justice Chester A. Fowler referred to it as &quot;that befuddling, nameless thing, that Janus-faced verbal monstrosity, neither word nor phrase, the child of a brain of someone too lazy or too dull to know what he did mean&quot;. The Kentucky Supreme Court has said it was a &quot;much-condemned conjunctive-disjunctive crutch of sloppy thinkers&quot;. Finally, the Florida Supreme Court has denounced the use of &quot;and/or&quot;, stating
...we take our position with that distinguished company of lawyers who have condemned its use. It is one of those inexcusable barbarisms which were sired by indolence and damned by indifference, and has no more place in legal terminology than the vernacular of Uncle Remus has in Holy Writ. I am unable to divine how such senseless jargon becomes current. The coiner of it certainly had no appreciation for terse and concise law English.

Other authorities point out that it is usually quite unambiguous and can be the most efficient way to indicate the inclusive &quot;or&quot; in some contexts. Kenneth Adams, lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and Alan S. Kaye, professor of linguistics at California State University, write, &quot;It does, after all, have a specific meaning—&quot;X and/or Y&quot; means &quot;X or Y or both&quot;.&quot; However, the authors state that it should not be used in language of obligation.

The legal usage authority Bryan A. Garner stated that use of the term is particularly harmful in legal writing because a bad-faith reader of a contract can pick whichever suits them, the &quot;and&quot; or the &quot;or.&quot; Courts called on to interpret it have applied a wide variety of standards, with little agreement.

<doc id="187015" wikidata="Q1057542" url="?curid=187015" title="Republic of Hawaii">
<text>The Republic of Hawaii (Hawaiian: &quot;Lepupalika o Hawaii&quot;) was a short-lived one-party state in Hawaii between July 4, 1894, when the Provisional Government of Hawaii had ended, and August 12, 1898, when it became annexed by the United States as an unincorporated and unorganized territory. In 1893, the Committee of Public Safety overthrew Queen Liliuokalani, the monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, after she rejected the 1887 Bayonet Constitution. The Committee of Public Safety intended for Hawaii to be annexed by the United States; however, President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat opposed to imperialism, refused. A new constitution was subsequently written while Hawaii was being prepared for annexation.

The leaders of the Republic, such as Sanford B. Dole and Lorrin A. Thurston, were Hawaii-born descendants of American settlers who spoke the Hawaiian language but had strong financial, political, and family ties to the United States. They intended the Republic to become a territory of the United States. Dole was a former member of the Royal Legislature from Koloa, Kauai, and Justice of the Kingdom&#x27;s Supreme Court, and he appointed Thurston—who had served as Minister of the Interior under King Kalākaua—to lead a lobbying effort in Washington, D.C., to secure Hawaii&#x27;s annexation by the United States. The issue of overseas imperialism was controversial in the United States due to its colonial origins. Hawaii was annexed under Republican President William McKinley on 12 August 1898, during the Spanish–American War. The Territory of Hawaii was formally established as part of the U.S. on June 14, 1900.

The Blount Report &quot;first provided evidence that officially identified the United States&#x27; complicity in the lawless overthrow of the lawful, peaceful government of Hawaii.&quot; American officials immediately recognized the new government and troops from the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) were sent by the U.S. Minister to aid in the overthrow. The Queen&#x27;s supporters claimed that the Marines presence frightened the Queen and thus enabled the revolution. Blount concluded that the United States had carried out unauthorized partisan activities, including the landing of U.S. Marines under a false or exaggerated pretext, to support the anti-royalist conspirators; that these actions were instrumental to the success of the revolution; and that the revolution was carried out against the wishes of a majority of the population of Hawaii.

==Establishment of the Republic==

In 1887, members of the Reform Party of Hawaii forced the King to accept a new constitution limiting the monarch&#x27;s constitutional power as defined by the Constitution of 1864. The Constitution of 1887, also called the Bayonet Constitution for the threats used to secure the King&#x27;s approval, was enacted without legislative approval, leaving the monarch as a figurehead. In 1893, a coup d&#x27;état against the monarch was carried out by more than 1,000 armed local men who were led by wealthy sugar planters and businessmen. There was no bloodshed as the royal armed forces did not resist. A temporary Provisional Government of Hawaii was formed by the Committee of Safety. The leaders of the coup, who had strong economic ties with the United States, wanted Hawaii to join the United States, lest the Japanese Empire take control. Annexation was delayed by two petitions with over 20,000 signatures representing over half of the Native Hawaiian population. Because U.S. President Cleveland opposed annexation, the Queen herself took up residence in Washington to lobby for her restoration.

President Cleveland sent an investigator who wrote the Blount Report, which concluded that Minister Stevens had manipulated and orchestrated the revolt. Cleveland decided that the United States should restore the Queen; he asked for Dole&#x27;s resignation; however, Dole ignored the request. The U.S. Senate held hearings regarding another report called the Morgan Report, which undermined the Blount Report&#x27;s claims. Public opinion in the United States favored annexation. In May 1894 the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution opposing restoration of the Queen, opposing intrusion into the affairs of the Dole government, and opposing American action that could lead immediately to annexation. President Cleveland thereupon dropped the issue, leaving the Republic of Hawaii to effectively fend for itself.

The Provisional Government convened a constitutional convention, limited to Hawaiians, and taxpayers of American or European origins, not including Asians.

==Politics==
The President of Hawaii was the head of state and head of government of the Republic of Hawaii. The constitution provided that the presidential term of office would be six years and specified that individuals could not be elected to consecutive terms in office. The President had the authority to veto legislation, which could be overridden by two-thirds majority in both houses of the legislature, and he was also commander-in-chief of the military. The President appointed, subject to the confirmation of the Senate, members of his Cabinet. Cabinet members were considered users of both houses of the Legislature, they could participate in proceedings, but could not vote as they were not elected members of the Legislature. If the presidency became vacant, the Minister of Foreign Affairs could serve as Acting President until the Legislature voted to elect a successor.

Article 23 of the constitution of 1894 specifically named Sanford B. Dole as the republic&#x27;s first President. He would also be the nation&#x27;s only President, as it was annexed by the United States in 1898. Upon annexation, Hawaii became a U.S. territory and Dole became its first Governor.

The republic&#x27;s Legislature consisted of a senate and a house of representatives. Each had fifteen members with the former having six-year terms and the latter only two with the exception of the first legislature which was constitutionally granted a three-year term. Appropriation bills originated from the Minister of Finance and were delivered to the Senate. The Senate also held the right to confirm presidential appointments and ratify treaties which made it more powerful in every aspect over the lower house. It was possible for legislators to concurrently serve as president, Cabinet minister, or Supreme Court justice.

As royalists had boycotted the republic and refused to take the oath of allegiance to run for office, the American Union Party won every seat in the 1894 and 1897 elections. There was also a property requirement of $1500 net worth to vote for Senators, kept from the 1887 constitution, which ran counter to the prevailing trends of that period. The 1897 election had the lowest turnout in Hawaii&#x27;s history with less than one percent of the population going to the polls. The new Republic Constitution allowed only men that were natural born citizens of the Hawaiian Kingdom, or naturalized Citizens of the Kingdom to vote in the new Republic. This eliminated most all Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, and European immigrants from voting. As a result, Native Hawaiians had a two-thirds majority voting block and were the highest represented group in the Republic Legislature. The Speaker of the House of the Republic was also a Hawaiian, John Lot Kaulukoʻu.

==Wilcox Rebellion of 1895==

Robert William Wilcox was a Hawaiian native revolutionary. In 1889, he led an army of 150 Hawaiians, Europeans and Chinese in rebellion against the Hawaiian Kingdom. In 1895, Wilcox participated in another attempt, this time to overthrow the Republic of Hawaii and to restore Queen Liliuokalani to power. Royalist supporters landed a cargo of arms and ammunition from San Francisco, California in a secret Honolulu location. At the location on January 6, 1895, a company of royalists met to draft plans to capture the government buildings by surprise. A premature encounter with a squad of police alarmed Honolulu and the plans were abandoned as the royalists were quickly routed. Wilcox spent several days in hiding in the mountains before being captured. The son of one annexationist was killed. Several other skirmishes occurred during the following week resulting in the capture of the leading conspirators and their followers. The government found arms and ammunition and some potentially evidential documents on the premises of Washington Place, Liliuokalani&#x27;s private residence, outlining in her own handwriting who she would select for her cabinet after the counter revolution, further implicating her in the plot.

==Liliuokalani&#x27;s trial==

The Republic of Hawaii put the former Queen on trial. The prosecution asserted that Liliuokalani had committed misprision of treason, because she allegedly knew that guns and bombs for the Wilcox attempted counter-revolution had been hidden in the flower bed of her personal residence at Washington Place. Liliuokalani denied these accusations.

She was sentenced to 5 years&#x27; imprisonment at hard labor and a fine of $10,000. However, the imprisonment was served in a large bedroom with a piano, bathroom with hot and cold running water bathtub and sink at Iolani Palace where she was allowed two maids in waiting while under guard by military personnel at all times. After eight months she was allowed to go to her Washington Place home and kept under house arrest by President Sanford B. Dole. A year later she was granted a full pardon, including the right to travel, and President Dole gave her a passport to travel to Washington D.C. to visit her friends and in-laws. However, she used that opportunity to lobby the U.S. Senate in 1897 against annexation.

==End and annexation of the Republic==


Upon the inauguration of William McKinley as the 25th President of the United States on March 4, 1897, the Republic of Hawaii resumed negotiations for annexation, which continued into the summer of 1898. In April 1898, the United States went to war with Spain, and Republic of Hawaii declared its neutrality. In practice, it gave enormous support to the United States, demonstrating its value as a naval base in wartime, and winning widespread American approval for its non-neutral behavior.

With the opposition weakened, Hawaii was annexed by means of the Newlands Resolution, which required only a majority vote in both houses. Most of the support came from Republicans. It passed the house by a vote of 209 to 91. It was approved on July 4, 1898, and signed on July 7 by McKinley. The transfer of sovereignty over the Hawaiian islands took place on August 12, 1898, with the lowering of the Flag of Hawaii and hoisting of the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; flag of the United States over the former royal Iolani Palace in its place. It was renamed from the Republic of Hawaii to the Territory of Hawaii, which was formally organized as an organized incorporated territory of the United States two years later.

===Popular controversy===

The issue of annexation became a major political issue heatedly debated across the United States, which carried over into the 1900 presidential election. By then the national consensus was in favor of the annexation of both Hawaii and the Philippines.

Historian Henry Graff says that in the mid-1890s, &quot;Public opinion at home seemed to indicate acquiescence... Unmistakably, the sentiment at home was maturing with immense force for the United States to join the great powers of the world in a quest for overseas colonies.&quot;

President Cleveland&#x27;s biographer Alyn Brodsky argues his position was a deeply personal conviction that would not tolerate an immoral action against the little kingdom:
:Just as he stood up for the Samoan Islands against Germany because he opposed the conquest of a lesser state by a greater one, so did he stand up for the Hawaiian Islands against his own nation. He could have let the annexation of Hawaii move inexorably to its inevitable culmination. But he opted for confrontation, which he hated, as it was to him the only way a weak and defenseless people might retain their independence. It was not the idea of annexation that Grover Cleveland opposed, but the idea of annexation as a pretext for illicit territorial acquisition.

Cleveland had to mobilize support from Southern Democrats to fight the treaty. He sent former Georgia Congressman James H. Blount as a special representative to Hawaii to investigate and provide a solution. Blount was well known for his opposition to imperialism. Blount was also a leader in the white supremacy movement that in the 1890s was ending the right to vote by southern Blacks. Some observers speculated he would support annexation on grounds of the inability of the Asiatics to govern themselves. Instead, Blount opposed imperialism, and called for the U.S. military to restore Queen Liliuokalani. He argued that the Hawaii natives should be allowed to continue their &quot;Asiatic ways.&quot;

A vigorous nationwide anti-expansionist movement, organized as the American Anti-Imperialist League, emerged that listened to Cleveland and Carl Schurz, as well as Democratic leader William Jennings Bryan, industrialist Andrew Carnegie, author Mark Twain, and sociologist William Graham Sumner. The anti-imperialists opposed expansion, believing that imperialism violated the fundamental principle that just republican government must derive from &quot;consent of the governed.&quot; The League argued that such activity would necessitate the abandonment of American ideals of self-government and non-intervention—ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence, George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address and Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address.

However, the Antis could not stop the even more energetic forces of imperialism. They were led by Secretary of State John Hay, naval strategist Alfred T. Mahan, Republican congressman Henry Cabot Lodge, Secretary of War Elihu Root, and young politician Theodore Roosevelt. These expansionists had vigorous support from newspaper publishers William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, whipping up popular excitement. Mahan and Roosevelt took the forging a global strategy calling for a competitive modern navy, Pacific bases, an isthmian canal through Nicaragua or Panama, and, above all, an assertive role for America as the largest industrial power. President McKinley&#x27;s position was that Hawaii could never survive on its own. It would quickly be gobbled up by Japan—already a fourth of the islands&#x27; population was Japanese. Japan would then dominate the Pacific and undermine American hopes for large-scale trade with Asia.

<doc id="187017" wikidata="Q333691" url="?curid=187017" title="Sanford B. Dole">
<text>Sanford Ballard Dole (April 23, 1844 – June 9, 1926) was a Hawaii-born lawyer and jurist. He lived through the periods when Hawaii was a kingdom, provisional government, republic, and territory. Dole advocated the westernization of Hawaiian government and culture. After the overthrow of the monarchy, he served as the President of the Republic of Hawaii until his government secured Hawaii&#x27;s annexation by the United States.

==Early life==
Dole was born April 23, 1844, in Honolulu to Protestant Christian missionaries from Maine in the United States. His father was Daniel Dole (1808–1878), principal at Oahu College (known as Punahou School after 1934), and his mother was Emily Hoyt Ballard (1808–1844). His mother died from complications within a few days of his birth. Dole was named after his maternal uncle, Sanford K. Ballard, a classmate of his father&#x27;s at Bowdoin College who died in 1841. He was nursed by a native Hawaiian, and his father married Charlotte Close Knapp in 1846. In 1855 the family moved to Kōloa on the island of Kauaii, where they operated another school, which Sanford attended.

Dole attended Oahu College for one year and then Williams College in 1866–1867. He worked in a law office in Boston for another year, at this time in the United States admission to the bar was by reading for the bar and thirty years later he would receive an honorary LL.D. degree from Williams, in 1897, in recognition of his service as the first and only elected president of Hawaii.

In 1873 he married Anna Prentice Cate. In December 1880 he was commissioned as a Notary Public in Honolulu. Dole won the 1884 and 1886 elections to the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom as a representative from Kauai, serving from 1884 to 1887, during which time he was active in securing the constitution of 1887.

==Bayonet Constitution==
In June 1887, local businessmen, sugar planters, and politicians backed by the Honolulu Rifles forced the dismissal of the cabinet of controversial Walter M. Gibson and forced the adoption of the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The new documents limited voting rights to the literate males of Hawaiian, European, and American descent, while imposing income and wealth requirements to be eligible to vote for the House of Nobles. This effectively consolidated power among the elite residents of the island. In addition, the new Constitution minimized the power of the Monarch in favor of more influential governance by the cabinet. Dole and other lawyers of American descent drafted this document, which became known as the &quot;Bayonet Constitution&quot;.

King Kalākaua appointed Dole a justice of the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawaii on December 28, 1887, and to a commission to revise judiciary laws on January 24, 1888. After Kalākaua&#x27;s death, his sister Queen Liliuokalani appointed him to her Privy Council on August 31, 1891.

==End of the monarchy==
The monarchy ended on January 17, 1893, after the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii organized by many of the same actors involved in the 1887 revolt. Although Dole declined to officially be part of the Committee of Safety, he helped draft their declaration.

Dole was named president of the Provisional Government of Hawaii that was formed after the coup and was recognized within 48 hours by all nations with diplomatic ties to the Kingdom of Hawaii, including the United Kingdom.
His cabinet (called the &quot;executive council&quot;) included James A. King as minister of the interior, William Owen Smith as attorney general, and banker Peter Cushman Jones as minister of finance. Dole acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs himself until February 15, 1894.
Later Samuel Mills Damon would serve as Minister of Finance.

With Grover Cleveland&#x27;s election as President of the United States, the Provisional Government&#x27;s hopes of annexation were derailed for a time. Indeed, Cleveland tried to directly help reinstate the monarchy, after an investigation led by James Henderson Blount. The Blount Report of July 17, 1893, commissioned by President Cleveland, concluded that the Committee of Safety conspired with U.S. ambassador John L. Stevens to land the United States Marine Corps, to forcibly remove Queen Liliuokalani from power, and declare a Provisional Government of Hawaii consisting of members from the Committee of Safety.

On November 16, 1893, Albert Willis presented the Queen with Cleveland&#x27;s request that she grant amnesty to the revolutionists in return for being restored to the throne. This request she flatly refused, stating that the revolutionists should be punished and should have their lands confiscated. According to Willis, she recommended that they be put to death. Though she later denied ever having recommended any such thing, her alleged attitude lost her the goodwill of the Cleveland administration, which thereupon recognized the Republic of Hawaii on July 4, 1894.

The Morgan Report of February 26, 1894, concluded that the overthrow was locally based, that it had its origins in monarchical corruption, and that American troops had not tried to bring about the monarchy&#x27;s collapse: rather, that the troops had acted merely to protect American property and citizens. Not long afterward, the Provisional Government held a constitutional convention. On July 4, 1894, this convention proclaimed the formal establishment of the Republic of Hawaii.

==President of the Republic of Hawaii==
Lorrin A. Thurston declined to run for the presidency of the Republic of Hawaii, and Dole ran instead, winning election in 1894. Dole would serve as the first and only elected president of the Republic of Hawaii from 1894 to 1898. Dole in turn appointed Thurston to lead the lobbying effort in Washington, D.C., to secure Hawaii&#x27;s annexation by the United States.

Dole&#x27;s government secured diplomatic recognition from every nation that had recognized the Kingdom of Hawaii, and weathered several attempts to restore the monarchy, including a January 1895 counter-rebellion led by Robert William Wilcox. After being defeated, Wilcox and the other conspirators were captured and sentenced to death, but had their sentences reduced or commuted by Dole. Queen Liliuokalani abdicated and, under duress, swore allegiance to the Republic of Hawaii, declaring, &quot;I hereby do fully and unequivocally admit and declare that the Government of the Republic of Hawaii is the only lawful Government of the Hawaiian Islands, and that the late Hawaiian monarchy is finally and forever ended and no longer of any legal or actual validity, force or effect whatsoever.&quot; She later provided a more detailed accounting of the events from her perspective in her book, &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s story by Hawaii&#x27;s queen, Liliuokalani&quot;.

==State Visit to the United States==
As president of the republic, Dole traveled to Washington, D.C., in early 1898 to personally urge annexation of Hawaii by the United States. Dole and his party traveled from Honolulu to San Francisco via steamship, arriving in the Bay on January 16. This marked the United States&#x27;s fifth state visit by a foreign leader, the first being King Kalakaua&#x27;s visit to the United States in 1874. After arriving in San Francisco, President Dole stayed in San Francisco&#x27;s Occidental Hotel, before leaving the city for Washington D.C on January 19. On the President&#x27;s last day in San Francisco, he was given a tour of the Presidio of San Francisco by General William Rufus Shafter, with the military band playing upon his arrival, and also had a luncheon with San Francisco&#x27;s mayor James D. Phelan. President Dole and his party took off for Washington D.C via railroad, using a private railcar called &quot;Guadalupe&quot;, supplied by Henry E. Huntington.

Dole&#x27;s travels would eventually take him to Chicago, where he was received by infantry and cavalry troops from Fort Sheridan. Eventually the President would reach his destination of Washington, D.C., on January 26, where he was met by Secretary of State John Sherman, and had a short conversation with President William McKinley. Sanford Dole and his party would leave Washington, D.C., on February 6, towards California, arriving in the city of Riverside on February 12.

==Governor and federal judge==
On July 4, 1898, the U.S. Congress passed a joint resolution to annex the Republic of Hawaii. Known as the Newlands Resolution after its sponsor, U.S. Representative Francis Newlands (D-Nevada), it came into effect on August 12, 1898. A formal ceremony marking the transfer of Hawaiian state sovereignty to the United States was held that day on the steps of ʻIolani Palace where the Hawaiian flag was lowered and the American flag raised in its place.

Under the terms of the Resolution, Dole retained the powers he previously exercised as President of Hawaii while Congress developed a new Hawaiian territorial frame of government. Later, when one was established through the Hawaiian Organic Act, President William McKinley appointed Dole as the first governor of the Territory of Hawaii. Dole assumed the office on June 14, 1900, but resigned November 23, 1903, to accept an appointment by President Theodore Roosevelt as judge for the U.S. District Court of Hawaii after the death of Morris M. Estee. He served in that post until his retirement on December 16, 1915, and was replaced by Horace Worth Vaughan.

Dole also served on commissions for Honolulu parks and the public archives. He died after a series of strokes on June 9, 1926. His ashes were interred in the cemetery of Kawaiahao Church.

==Family and legacy==
Dole&#x27;s cousin, Edmund Pearson Dole, came to Hawaii to practice law in 1895, and became Attorney General of Hawaii from 1900 to 1903. Another cousin, James Dole, came to Hawaii in 1899 and founded the Hawaiian Pineapple Company on Oahu, which later became the Dole Food Company. James&#x27; father Charles Fletcher Dole also came to Hawaii in 1909.

Dole Middle School, located in Kalihi Valley on the island of Oahu, was named after him in April 1956, about a century after his father founded the school in Kōloa.
In the film &quot;Princess Kaiulani&quot;, his role was played by Will Patton.

In Hawaiian, the pale and hair-like Spanish moss is called &quot;ʻumiʻumi-o-Dole&quot;, meaning &quot;Dole&#x27;s beard&quot;. His wife Anna had the bird species &quot;Ciridops anna&quot; named after her.

<doc id="187022" wikidata="Q649090" url="?curid=187022" title="Cupronickel">
<text>Cupronickel or copper–nickel (CuNi) is an alloy of copper with nickel, usually along with small quantities of other metals added for strength, such as iron and manganese. The copper content typically varies from 60 to 90 percent. (Monel is a nickel–copper alloy that contains a minimum of 52 percent nickel.)

Despite its high copper content, cupronickel is silver in colour. Cupronickel is highly resistant to corrosion by salt water, and is therefore used for piping, heat exchangers and condensers in seawater systems, as well as for marine hardware. It is sometimes used for the propellers, propeller shafts, and hulls of high-quality boats. Other uses include military equipment and chemical industry, petrochemical industry, and electrical industries.

In decorative use, a cupronickel alloy called nickel silver is common, although it contains additional zinc but no silver.

Another common 20th-century use of cupronickel was silver-coloured coins. For this use, the typical alloy has 3:1 copper to nickel ratio, with very small amounts of manganese. In the past, true silver coins were debased with cupronickel, such as coins of the pound sterling from 1947 onward having their content replaced.

== Name ==
Cupronickel, as the German &quot;kupfernickel&quot;, originally referred to the mineral form of nickel arsenide; natural deposits had superficial similarities to copper ores, and local folklore blamed the sprite Nickel (compare Old Nick) for the absence of usable copper and health issues from arsenic exposure. It was from a sample of this &quot;kupfernickel&quot; that Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt first isolated elemental nickel in 1751, naming the new metal for the sprite. The mineral was given its modern names, nickeline and niccolite, by the mid-19th century.

Aside from &quot;cupronickel&quot; and &quot;copper–nickel&quot;, several other terms have been used to describe the material: the tradenames &quot;Alpaka&quot; or &quot;Alpacca&quot;, &quot;Argentan Minargent&quot;, the registered French term &quot;cuivre blanc&quot;, &quot;Chinese silver&quot;, and the romanized Cantonese term &quot;Paktong&quot;, 白銅 (the French and Cantonese terms both meaning &quot;white copper&quot;).

Cupronickel alloys containing zinc are referred to as &quot;nickel silver&quot;, also sometimes &quot;hotel silver&quot;, &quot;German silver&quot;, &quot;plata alemana&quot; (Spanish for &quot;German silver&quot;).

==Applications==

===Marine engineering===
Cupronickel alloys are used for marine applications due to their resistance to seawater corrosion, good fabricability, and their effectiveness in lowering macrofouling levels. Alloys ranging in composition from 90% Cu–10% Ni to 70% Cu–30% Ni are commonly specified in heat exchanger or condenser tubes in a wide variety of marine applications.

Important marine applications for cupronickel include:
* Shipbuilding and repair: hulls of boats and ships, seawater cooling, bilge and ballast, sanitary, fire fighting, inert gas, hydraulic and pneumatic chiller systems.
* Desalination plants: brine heaters, heat rejection and recovery, and in evaporator tubing.
* Offshore oil and gas platforms and processing and FPSO vessels: systems and splash zone sheathings.
* Power generation: steam turbine condensers, oil coolers, auxiliary cooling systems and high pressure pre-heaters at nuclear and fossil fuel power plants.
* Seawater system components: condenser and heat exchanger tubes, tube sheets, piping, high pressure systems, fittings, pumps, and water boxes.

===Coinage===


The successful use of cupronickel in coinage is due to its corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity, durability, malleability, low allergy risk, ease of stamping, antimicrobial properties and recyclability.

In Europe, Switzerland pioneered cupronickel-based &quot;billon&quot; coinage in 1850, with the addition of silver and zinc, for coins of 5, 10 and 20 Rappen. Starting in 1860/1861, Belgium issued 5, 10 and 20 Centimes in pure cupronickel (75% copper, 25% nickel, without additional silver and zinc), and Germany issued 5 and 10 Pfennig in the same 75:25 ratio from 1873/1874 (until 1915/1916). In 1879, Switzerland, for 5 and 10 Rappen coins, also adopted that cheaper 75:25 copper to nickel ratio then being used in Belgium, the United States and Germany. From 1947 to 2012, all &quot;silver&quot; coinage in the UK was made from cupronickel (but from 2012 onwards the two smallest UK cupronickel denominations were replaced with lower-cost nickel-plated steel coins). Moreover, when silver prices rose in the 1960s/1970s also some other European countries replaced remaining silver denominations by cupronickel, e.g. the 1/2 to (pictured) 5 Swiss franc coins starting 1968 and German 5 Deutsche Mark 1975–2001. Since 1999, cupronickel is also used for the inner segment of the 1 euro coin and the outer segment of the 2 euro coin.

In part due to silver hoarding in the Civil War, the United States Mint first used cupronickel for circulating coinage in three-cent pieces starting in 1865, and then for five-cent pieces starting in 1866. Prior to these dates, both denominations had been made only in silver in the United States.
Cupronickel is the cladding on either side of United States half-dollars (50¢) since 1971, and all quarters (25¢) and dimes (10¢) made after 1964. Currently, some circulating coins, such as the United States Jefferson nickel (5¢), the Swiss franc, and the South Korean 500 and 100 won are made of solid cupronickel (75:25 ratio).

===Decorative housewares===
Nickel silver cupronickels are used extensively as a substitute for silver in tableware and other decorative housewares. Nickel silver is also used as a base for silver plating, where the product is known as electro-plated nickel silver, or EPNS.

===Other usage===
A thermocouple junction is formed from a pair of thermocouple conductors such as iron-constantan, copper-constantan or nickel-chromium/nickel-aluminium. The junction may be protected within a sheath of copper, cupronickel or stainless steel.

Cupronickel is used in cryogenic applications. It retains high ductility and thermal conductivity at very low temperatures. Where other metals like steel or aluminum would shatter and become thermally inert, cupronickel&#x27;s unusual thermal and mechanical performance at these low temperatures facilitate a number of niche uses. Machinery that must perform many duty cycles at continuously low-temperatures and heat exchangers at cryogenic plants are the main industrial destinations of cupronickel in cryogenic applications. Niche applications also exist, for example the alloy&#x27;s high thermal conductivity at low temperatures has made cupronickel ubiquitous in freeze branding operations.

Beginning around the turn of the 20th century, bullet jackets were commonly made from this material. It was soon replaced with gilding metal to reduce metal fouling in the bore.

Currently, cupronickel and nickel silver remain the basic material for silver-plated cutlery. It is commonly used for mechanical and electrical equipment, medical equipment, zippers, jewelry items, and both for strings for instruments in the violin family, and for guitar frets. Fender Musical Instruments used &quot;CuNiFe&quot; magnets in their &quot;Wide Range Humbucker&quot; pickup for various Telecaster and Starcaster guitars during the 1970s.

For high-quality cylinder locks and locking systems, cylinder cores are made from wear-resistant cupronickel.

Cupronickel has been used as an alternative to traditional steel hydraulic brake lines (the pipes containing the brake fluid), as it does not rust. Since cupronickel is much softer than steel, it bends and flares more easily, and the same property allows it to form a better seal with hydraulic components.

==Physical and mechanical properties==
Cupronickel lacks a copper color due to nickel&#x27;s high electronegativity, which causes a loss of one electron in copper&#x27;s d-shell (leaving 9 electrons in the d-shell versus pure copper&#x27;s typical 10 electrons).

Important properties of cupronickel alloys include corrosion resistance, inherent resistance to macrofouling, good tensile strength, excellent ductility when annealed, thermal conductivity and expansion characteristics amenable for heat exchangers and condensers, good thermal conductivity and ductility at cryogenic temperatures and beneficial antimicrobial touch surface properties.

Subtle differences in corrosion resistance and strength determine which alloy is selected. Descending the table, the maximum allowable flow rate in piping increases, as does the tensile strength.

In seawater, the alloys have excellent corrosion rates which remain low as long as the maximum design flow velocity is not exceeded. This velocity depends on geometry and pipe diameter. They have high resistance to crevice corrosion, stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement that can be troublesome to other alloy systems. Copper–nickels naturally form a thin protective surface layer over the first several weeks of exposure to seawater and this provides its ongoing resistance. Additionally, they have a high inherent biofouling resistance to attachment by macrofoulers (e.g. seagrasses and molluscs) living in the seawater. To use this property to its full potential, the alloy needs to be free of the effects of, or insulated from, any form of cathodic protection.

However, Cu–Ni alloys can show high corrosion rates in polluted or stagnant seawater when sulfides or ammonia are present. It is important, therefore, to avoid exposure to such conditions, particularly during commissioning and refit while the surface films are maturing. Ferrous sulfate dosing to sea water systems can provide improved resistance.
As copper and nickel alloy with each other easily and have simple structures, the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated. Strength and hardness for each individual alloy is increased by cold working; they are not hardened by heat treatment. Joining of 90–10 (C70600) and 70–30 (C71500) is possible by both welding or brazing. They are both weldable by the majority of techniques, although autogenous (welding without weld consumables) or oxyacetylene methods are not recommended. The 70–30 rather than 90–10 weld consumables are normally preferred for both alloys and no after-welding heat treatment is required. They can also be welded directly to steel, providing a 65% nickel–copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects. The C71640 alloy tends to be used as seamless tubing and expanded rather than welded into the tube plate. Brazing requires appropriate silver-base brazing alloys. However, great care must be taken to ensure that there are no stresses in the Cu–Ni being silver brazed, since any stress can cause intergranular penetration of the brazing material, and severe stress cracking (see image). Thus, full annealing of any potential mechanical stress is necessary.

Applications for Cu–Ni alloys have withstood the test of time, as they are still widely used and range from seawater system piping, condensers and heat exchangers in naval vessels, commercial shipping, multiple-stage flash desalination and power stations. They have also been used as splash zone cladding on offshore structures and protective cladding on boat hulls, as well as for solid hulls themselves.

Due to its ductility, cupronickel alloys can be readily fabricated in a wide variety of product forms and fittings. Cupronickel tubing can be readily expanded into tube sheets for the manufacturing of shell and tube heat exchangers.

Details of fabrication procedures, including general handling, cutting and machining, forming, heat treatment, preparing for welding, weld preparations, tack welding, welding consumables, welding processes, painting, mechanical properties of welds, and tube and pipe bending are available.

==Standards==
ASTM, EN, and ISO standards exist for ordering wrought and cast forms of cupronickel.

Thermocouples and resistors whose resistance is stable across changes in temperature contain alloy constantan, which consists of 55% copper and 45% nickel.

==History==
===Chinese history===
Cupronickel alloys were known as &quot;white copper&quot; to the Chinese since about the third century BC. Some weapons made during the Warring States period were made with Cu-Ni alloys. The theory of Chinese origins of Bactrian cupronickel was suggested in 1868 by Flight, who found that the coins considered the oldest cupronickel coins yet discovered were of a very similar alloy to Chinese &quot;paktong&quot;.

The author-scholar, Ho Wei, precisely described the process of making cupronickel in about 1095 AD. The &quot;paktong&quot; alloy was described as being made by adding small pills of naturally occurring &quot;yunnan&quot; ore to a bath of molten copper. When a crust of slag formed, saltpeter was added, the alloy was stirred and the ingot was immediately cast. Zinc is mentioned as an ingredient but there are no details about when it was added. The ore used is noted as solely available from Yunnan, according to the story:

&quot;San Mao Chun were at Tanyang during a famine year when many people died, so taking certain chemicals, Ying projected them onto silver, turning it into gold, and he also transmuted iron into silver – thus enabling the lives of many to be saved [through purchasing grain through this fake silver and gold]
Thereafter all those who prepared chemical powders by heating and transmuting copper by projection called their methods &quot;Tanyang techniques&quot;.
The late Ming and Qing literature have very little information about &quot;paktong&quot;. However, it is first mentioned specifically by name in the &quot;Thien Kung Khai Wu&quot; of &quot;circa&quot; 1637:

&quot;When &quot;lu kan shih&quot; (zinc carbonate, calamine) or &quot;wo chhein&quot; (zinc metal) is mixed and combined with &quot;chih thung&quot; (copper), one gets &#x27;yellow bronze&#x27; (ordinary brass). When &quot;phi shang&quot; and other arsenic substances are heated with it, one gets &#x27;white bronze&#x27; or white copper: &quot;pai thong&quot;. When alum and niter and other chemicals are mixed together one gets &quot;ching thung&quot;: green bronze.&quot;
Ko Hung stated in 300 AD: &quot;The Tanyang copper was created by throwing a mercuric elixir into Tanyang copper and heated- gold will be formed.&quot; However, the &quot;Pha Phu Tsu&quot; and the &quot;Shen I Ching&quot; describing a statue in the Western provinces as being of silver, tin, lead and Tanyang copper – which looked like gold, and could be forged for plating and inlaying vessels and swords.

Joseph Needham &quot;et al.&quot; argue that cupronickel was at least known as a unique alloy by the Chinese during the reign of Liu An in 120 BC in Yunnan. Moreover, the Yunnanese State of Tien was founded in 334 BC as a colony of the Chu. Most likely, modern &quot;paktong&quot; was unknown to Chinese of the day – but the naturally occurring Yunnan ore cupronickel alloy was likely a valuable internal trade commodity.

===Greco-Bactrian coinage===

In 1868, W. Flight discovered a Greco-Bactrian coin comprising 20% nickel that dated from 180 to 170 BCE with the bust of Euthydemus II on the obverse. Coins of a similar alloy with busts of his younger brothers, Pantaleon and Agathocles, were minted around 170 BCE. The composition of the coins was later verified using the traditional wet method and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. Cunningham in 1873 proposed the &quot;Bactrian nickel theory,&quot; which suggested that the coins must have been the result of overland trade from China through India to Greece. Cunningham&#x27;s theory was supported by scholars such as W. W. Tarn, Sir John Marshall, and J. Newton Friend, but was criticized by E. R. Caley and S. van R. Cammann.

In 1973, Cheng and Schwitter in their new analyses suggested that the Bactrian alloys (copper, lead, iron, nickel and cobalt) were closely similar to the Chinese &quot;paktong&quot;, and of nine known Asian nickel deposits, only those in China could provide the identical chemical compositions. Cammann criticized Cheng and Schwitter&#x27;s paper, arguing that the decline of cupronickel currency should not have coincided with the opening of the Silk Road. If the Bactrian nickel theory were true, according to Cammann, the Silk Road would have increased the supply of cupronickel. However, the end of Greco-Bactrian cupronickel currency could be attributed to other factors such as the end of the House of Euthydemus.

===Judeo-Christian history===
The alloy seems to have been rediscovered by the West during alchemy experiments. Notably, Andreas Libavius, in his &quot;Alchemia&quot; of 1597, mentions a surface-whitened copper &quot;aes album&quot; by mercury or silver. But in &quot;De Natura Metallorum&quot; in &quot;Singalarum&quot; Part 1, published in 1599, the same term was applied to &quot;tin&quot; from the East Indies (modern-day Indonesia and the Philippines) and given the Spanish name, &quot;tintinaso&quot;.

Richard Watson of Cambridge appears to be the first to discover that cupronickel was an alloy of three metals. In attempting to rediscover the secret of white-copper, Watson critiqued Jean-Baptiste Du Halde&#x27;s &quot;History of China&quot; (1688) as confusing the term &quot;paktong&#x27;., He noted the Chinese of his day did not form it as an alloy but rather smelted readily available unprocessed ore:

&quot;...appeared from a vast series of experiments made at Peking- that it occurred naturally as an ore mined at the region, the most extraordinary copper is &quot;pe-tong&quot; or white copper: it is white when dug out of the mine and even more white within than without. It appears, by a vast number of experiments made at Peking, that its colour is owing to no mixture; on the contrary, all mixtures diminish its beauty, for, when it is rightly managed it looks exactly like silver and were there not a necessity of mixing a little tutenag or such metal to soften it, it would be so much more the extraordinary as this sort of copper is found nowhere but in China and that only in the Province of Yunnan&quot;. Notwithstanding what is here said, of the colour of the copper being owing to no mixture, it is certain the Chinese white copper as brought to us, is a mixt [sic: mixed] metal; so that the ore from which it was extracted must consist of various metallic substances; and from such ore that the natural &quot;orichalcum&quot; if it ever existed, was made.&quot;
During the peak European importation of Chinese white-copper from 1750 to 1800, increased attention was made to its discovering its constituents. Peat and Cookson found that &quot;the darkest proved to contain 7.7% nickel and the lightest said to be indistinguishable from silver with a characteristic bell-like resonance when struck and considerable resistance to corrosion, 11.1%&quot;.

Another trial by Andrew Fyfe estimated the nickel content at 31.6%. Guesswork ended when James Dinwiddie of the Macartney Embassy brought back in 1793, at considerable personal risk (smuggling of &quot;paktong&quot; ore was a capital crime by the Chinese Emperor), some of the ore from which &quot;paktong&quot; was made. Cupronickel became widely understood, as published by E. Thomason, in 1823, in a submission, later rejected for not being new knowledge, to the Royal Society of Arts.

Efforts in Europe to exactly duplicate the Chinese &quot;paktong&quot; failed due to a general lack of requisite complex cobalt–nickel–arsenic naturally occurring ore. However, the Schneeberg district of Germany, where the famous &quot;Blaufarbenwerke&quot; made cobalt blue and other pigments, solely held the requisite complex cobalt–nickel–arsenic ores in Europe.

At the same time, the Prussian &quot;Verein zur Beförderung des Gewerbefleißes&quot; (Society for the Improvement of Business Diligence/Industriousness) offered a prize for the mastery of the process. Unsurprisingly, Dr E.A. Geitner and J.R. von Gersdoff of Schneeberg won the prize and launched their &quot;German silver&quot; brand under the trade names &quot;Argentan&quot; and &quot;Neusilber&quot; (new silver).

In 1829, Percival Norton Johnston persuaded Dr. Geitner to establish a foundry in Bow Common behind Regents&#x27; Park Canal in London, and obtained ingots of nickel-silver with the composition 18% Ni, 55% Cu and 27% Zn.

Between 1829 and 1833, Percival Norton Johnson was the first person to refine cupronickel on the British Isles. He became a wealthy man, producing in excess of 16.5 tonnes per year. The alloy was mainly made into cutlery by the Birmingham firm William Hutton and sold under the trade-name &quot;Argentine&quot;.

Johnsons&#x27; most serious competitors, Charles Askin and Brok Evans, under the brilliant chemist Dr. EW Benson, devised greatly improved methods of cobalt and nickel suspension and marketed their own brand of nickel-silver, called &quot;British Plate&quot;.

John Fairfield Thompson writes that the 3:1 copper-nickel alloy was developed for coinage by Belgium in 1860. In 1866, the US Congress passed a law authorizing the creation of a 3-cent coin consisting of 75% copper and 25% nickel, and the nickel, as it became known, was created. Brazil adopted the alloy for coin in 1870, and Imperial Germany followed in 1873. France and Greece adopted of this technology in the 20th century.

After the unification of Germany cupronickel coinage was introduced by the German Coinage Act, and sudden demand of nickel for tens of millions of 5 and 10 pfennig coins minted in 1873-1876 caused such a shock on the previously tranquil market that price more than tripled, leading to a significant expansion of supply.

By 1902 the alloy was used in the UK for bullet jackets.

By the 1920s, a 70–30 copper–nickel grade was developed for naval condensers. Soon afterwards, a 2% manganese and 2% iron alloy now known as alloy C71640 was introduced for a UK power station which needed better erosion resistance because the levels of entrained sand in the seawater. A 90–10 alloy first became available in the 1950s, initially for seawater piping, and is now the more widely used alloy for this purpose.

<text>Coombs&#x27; method is a ranked voting system. Like instant-runoff (IRV-RCV), Coombs&#x27; method is a sequential-loser method, where the last-place finisher according to one method is eliminated in each round. However, unlike in instant-runoff, each round has electors voting against their least-favorite candidate; the candidate ranked last by the most voters is eliminated.

The method fails most voting system criteria, including Condorcet&#x27;s majority criterion, monotonicity, participation, and clone-independence. However, it does satisfy Black&#x27;s single-peaked median voter criterion.

== History ==
The method was popularized by Clyde Coombs. It was described by Edward J. Nanson as the &quot;Venetian method&quot; (which should not be confused with the Republic of Venice&#x27;s use of score voting in elections for Doge).

==Procedures==
Each voter rank-orders all of the candidates on their ballot. Otherwise, the candidate ranked last by the largest number (plurality) of voters is eliminated, making each individual round equivalent to anti-plurality voting. Conversely, under instant-runoff voting, the candidate ranked first (among non-eliminated candidates) by the fewest voters is eliminated.

In some sources, the elimination proceeds regardless of whether any candidate is ranked first by a majority of voters, and the last candidate to be eliminated is the winner. This variant of the method can result in a different winner than the former one (unlike in instant-runoff voting, where checking to see if any candidate is ranked first by a majority of voters is only a shortcut that does not affect the outcome).

==An example==
Assuming all of the voters vote sincerely (strategic voting is discussed below), the results would be as follows, by percentage:

* In the first round, no candidate has an absolute majority of first-place votes (51).
* Memphis, having the most last-place votes (26+15+17=58), is therefore eliminated.
* In the second round, Memphis is out of the running, and so must be factored out. Memphis was ranked first on Group A&#x27;s ballots, so the second choice of Group A, Nashville, gets an additional 42 first-place votes, giving it an absolute majority of first-place votes (68 versus 15+17=32), and making it the winner.
* Note that the last-place votes are only used to eliminate a candidate in a voting round where no candidate achieves an absolute majority; they are disregarded in a round where any candidate has more than 50%. Thus last-place votes play no role in the final round.

== In practice ==
The voting rounds used in the reality television program &quot;Survivor&quot; could be considered a variation of Coombs&#x27; method but with sequential voting rounds. Everyone votes for one candidate they support for elimination each round, and the candidate with a plurality of that vote is eliminated. A strategy difference is that sequential rounds of voting means the elimination choice is fixed in a ranked ballot Coombs&#x27; method until that candidate is eliminated.

== Potential for strategic voting ==
Like anti-plurality voting, Coombs&#x27; rule is extremely vulnerable to strategic voting. As a result, it is more often used as an example of a pathological voting rule than a serious proposal. The equilibrium position for Coombs&#x27; method is extremely sensitive to incomplete ballots and strategic nomination because the vast majority of voters&#x27; effects on the election come from how they fill out the bottom of their ballots. As a result, voters have a strong incentive to rate the strongest candidates last to defeat them in earlier rounds.

<doc id="187036" wikidata="Q6132697" url="?curid=187036" title="James Dole">
<text>James Drummond Dole (September 27, 1877 – May 20, 1958), the &quot;Pineapple King&quot;, was an American industrialist who developed the pineapple industry in Hawaii. He established the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (HAPCO) which was later reorganized to become the Dole Food Company that operates in over 90 countries. Dole was a cousin (once removed) of Sanford B. Dole, President of the Republic of Hawaii.

==Early life==
James Dole was born on September 27, 1877, in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts (now part of Boston), to an American Puritan family long settled in the country since colonial America times. His father was Charles Fletcher Dole, a Unitarian minister, and his mother was Frances Drummond. His paternal great-grandfather was Wigglesworth Dole (1779–1845). His maternal grandfather was also a clergyman, James Drummond. Growing up, Dole attended Roxbury Latin School in Roxbury, Massachusetts, from which he graduated.

In 1899, Dole obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in agriculture from the Bussey Institution of Harvard University. After receiving US$50 as a gift, Dole began saving money for a future business. After accumulating $16,240, Dole moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, at the age of 22, arriving on November 16, 1899, (then governed by his cousin Sanford B. Dole, after the 1893 overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani). He purchased a government homestead in the central plains of the island of Oahu at .
After experimenting with a number of crops, he settled on planting pineapple.

==Hawaiian Pineapple Company==
His farm grew, and Dole constructed a cannery and packing plant in the town of Wahiawa. Soon, yields and popularity of his product proved greater than he expected and Dole built a new cannery and packing plant near Honolulu Harbor. That same year, 1907, Dole purchased magazine advertisements to promote his canned pineapples. He developed the first nationwide consumer ad campaign in the United States and was successful. Demand for Hawaiian pineapple grew even more.

In 1913, Dole invested in a new machine invented by Henry Gabriel Ginaca that could peel and core 35 pineapples every minute. Before the invention, Dole had to contend with the slow pace of having hundreds of workers peel and core each pineapple by hand. With a fully mechanized outfit, Dole&#x27;s business boomed once more. Rival pineapple companies slowly began to adopt the Ginaca machine, seeing how much Dole improved his business with the introduction of new technologies. During this period, the Hawaiian pineapple sector was at its most profitable as various small companies operating on comparatively modern small land made middling income for the operators. However, this was about to change as Dole was soon to corner the market and turn it into a single mighty industry dominated by a small group of companies who mass-produced the fruit for the rest of the global market.

By 1922, Dole had managed to convince his family&#x27;s network in Hawaii and in Boston to arrange for a sizable capital investment fund with which he purchased the island of Lānai and developed it as a vast pineapple plantation. It became the largest plantation in the world with over 20,000 acres (8,100 ha) devoted exclusively to growing pineapple. Utilizing large mechanized production and importing large numbers of foreign workers who were paid at indentured servitude levels, Dole managed to reduce the price of his pineapples to such a level that it drove every other producer out of the business which didn&#x27;t fall into line with his scheme. With this vast pineapple cultivation at the company&#x27;s disposal, throughout the 20th century, Lānai produced over seventy-five percent of the world&#x27;s pineapple crop, thereby dominating the market, and in turn, the place acquired the nickname of Pineapple Island. Dole also purchased land on the island of Maui. The largest competitors in the production of pineapple in Hawaii were Maui based affiliates of Alexander &amp; Baldwin.

In 1927, inspired by Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s successful trans-Atlantic flight, and seeing the potential air transportation could play in delivering his fruit, thereby making an end-run around what remained of his competitors in the Alexander &amp; Baldwin affiliated Matson Navigation Company, Dole sponsored the Dole Air Race, putting up a prize of US$25,000 for the first airplane to fly from Oakland, California, to Honolulu, and US$10,000 for second place. Those prizes were won by the only two airplanes to survive the flight.
Ten other people died in their attempts. Dole contributed reward money to find the missing planes, but no trace was ever found. A third plane who joined the rescue efforts was also lost and unrecovered.

However, these investments in land, mechanization, and finally air transportation combined with the resulting decrease in the price of pineapples, placed the company in a vulnerable price position. Because pineapples take two years to grow to maturity, the Great Depression of the 1930s and the resulting decrease in demand caused the company to lose money. By December 1932 Dole was removed from management of the company and replaced by Atherton Richards, the grandson of Joseph Ballard Atherton. At that time, Castle &amp; Cooke took a stake in the company.

==Family and retirement==
Dole married Belle Dickey (1880–1972) in Jamaica Plain on November 23, 1906. His wife was the sister of architect Charles William Dickey, a member of another missionary family. They had five children: Richard Alexander Dole was born on October 28, 1907, James Drummond Dole, Jr. was born on February 6, 1910, Elisabeth Dole was born on April 25, 1911, Charles Herbert Dole was born on October 30, 1914, and Barbara Dole (married to Tambi Larsen) was born on October 10, 1916.

Sanford Dole had asked to avoid using the Dole name for products, but it had become well-known, at least within Hawaii. The first product to actually bear his name was the canned Dole pineapple juice. 
Dole retired in 1948. He suffered from various ailments in retirement; the worst were a series of strokes. A heart attack finally took Dole&#x27;s life on May 20, 1958.

Dole was buried in Makawao Union Church cemetery near Makawao, Hawaii, on the island of Maui. His grave overlooked the slopes of Haleakala and the vast pineapple fields of what was at the time his Maui pineapple plantation. His wife Belle inscribed the words on his gravestone, &quot;He was a Man, Take Him All in All. I Shall Not Look Upon His Like Again.&quot;

==Legacy==
About of the original estate, including surrounding horticultural gardens, was kept in the Dole family until 1972. Although his original three-room house collapsed in 1971, a kitchen house from 1901, and a prefabricated building constructed in 1905 and expanded around 1909 for his growing family, remained but were deteriorating. In the late 1970s, the new owners developed the land into suburban residences. The remaining structures were removed from Wahiawa for the new subdivision. The Waipahu Cultural Garden in Waipahu, Hawaii, at recreated a Hawaiian plantation village.
The tourist attraction known as the Dole Plantation was established in 1950 as a small fruit stand in the middle of Dole&#x27;s original pineapple fields. In 1989, the fruit stand was transformed into a plantation home mounted on what looks like a hill of red dirt, characteristic of Wahiawa. The plantation home became a living museum and historical archive of the life and work of the industrialist.
It is located off of Kamehameha Highway (Route 99), at .

The plantation features the world&#x27;s largest maze, grown entirely out of Hawaiian plants.
Originally built in 1998, it lost its place in the Guinness Book of World Records until it was expanded in July 2007. The maze covers and paths are long.

The &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; is a two-mile (3 km) train ride through the plantation that is fully animated, while explaining the history of the pineapple. The plantation garden tour gives information about North Shore, the Hibiscus, native species, the Lei, irrigation, Bromeliads, the Ti Leaf, and Life on the plantation.

In 1991, the Dole Cannery closed its operations and was transformed into a multi-purpose facility with media studios, conference rooms and ballrooms. The lower levels houses a modern shopping center and an 18-screen multiplex cinema owned by Regal Entertainment Group. The actual ginaca machines and cannery storage were preserved and turned into a museum of Hawaiian Pineapple Company history. The cannery is located in the area known as Iwilei, between Honolulu Harbor and Kapālama, at 650 Iwilei Road Honolulu, , and ballrooms across the street.

<text>SoapCity is a defunct soap opera website, owned by Sony Pictures Digital. The site was the former home to the official websites for two soap operas produced by Columbia TriStar Television, (now Sony Pictures Television) NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. In addition, Procter &amp; Gamble Productions contracted with SoapCity to handle the web presence for their two CBS series, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. 

When announced in 1999, SoapCity was planned to be the online component to a Sony-produced cable channel of the same name, which would air same-day repeats and archives of these same shows. However the channel would never air after being beaten to the market by ABC/Disney&#x27;s SoapNet, contractual objections by NBC and CBS at the time disallowing re-airs on a network not owned by them, and distribution and programming complications with Sony&#x27;s Game Show Network which made launching a second channel untenable. 

In addition to standard coverage of daytime soap operas, including news stories, catch-up synopses and story analysis, the site was one of the first to allow day-and-day digital downloads of &quot;Days&quot; and &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;, along with archived episodes dating back to the series&#x27; 1965 and 1973 launches. Eventually the site became a landing page redirecting viewers to the sites of their soap operas on their television networks, though as of 2017, the domain is defunct, but still held by Sony Pictures Television.

SoapCity was created and executive produced by soap opera journalist Michael Fairman.

<text>Vendôme (, ) is a subprefecture of the department of Loir-et-Cher, France. It is also the department&#x27;s third-biggest commune with 15,856 inhabitants (2019).
It is one of the main towns along the river Loir. The river divides itself at the entrance of Vendôme, intersecting it into numerous different arms. The town has a rich medieval history and many historical monuments.

==History==
Vendôme (in ) appears originally to have been a Gallic , replaced later by a feudal castle, around which the modern town arose. Christianity was introduced by in the 5th century, and the important abbey of the Trinity (which claimed to possess a tear shed by Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus) was founded about 1030. When the reign of the House of Capet began, Vendôme formed the chief town of a county belonging to Bouchard, called &quot;the Venerable&quot;, who died in the monastery of in 1007.

The succession passed by various marriages to the houses of , and . Bouchard VI, Count of Vendôme and Castres (died ), left as his heiress his sister Catherine, the wife of John of Bourbon, count of La Marche. The county of Vendôme was raised to the rank of a duchy and a peerage of France for Charles of Bourbon (1515); his son , king of Navarre, was the father of Henry IV, who gave the duchy of Vendôme in 1598 to his illegitimate son César de Bourbon (1594–1665). , Duke of Vendôme, took part in the disturbances which went on in France under the government of and of ; he was the father of Louis, Duke of Vendôme, who married a niece of Mazarin, and . The last of his family in the male line was Louis XIV&#x27;s famous general, (1645–1712).

, King of Brittany, died undefeated in Vendôme in 851, after conquering the counties of and .

The , leader of 6,000 French troops in the American Revolutionary War, was born in Vendôme.

Place Vendôme in Paris had been the site of the , a mansion which belonged to , the illegitimate son of Henry IV and his mistress .

==Geography==
Vendôme is located northwest of the city of Blois and 40 minutes from Paris by TGV train (Vendôme-Villiers-sur-Loir TGV station). The town lies on the river Loir, which here divides into numerous arms intersecting the town.

==Administration==
Vendôme is the capital of the arrondissement of Vendôme in the Loir-et-Cher department, of which it is a sub-prefecture. It has a tribunal of first instance.

==Population==
==Sights==
On the south, it is overlooked by an eminence on which stand the ruins of the castle of the counts of Vendôme. The abbey-church of the Holy Trinity has a façade in the florid Gothic style. Abbey buildings of various periods lie round the church. The church of &quot;La Madeleine&quot; (15th century) is surmounted by a stone spire, an imitation of that of the abbey. The tower of &quot;Saint-Martin&quot; (16th century) represents the vanished church of that name.

Other monuments are: the old gate, the &quot;Porte Saint-Georges&quot;; its river front is composed of two large crenelated and machicolated towers, connected by a pavilion, and the ancient hospital of Saint-Jacques that afterwards became a college of the Oratorians, then a &quot;lycée&quot; for boys and that is now occupied by the town administration offices. The charming chapel, in the most florid Gothic style, is preserved. In the garden surrounding, is located the tourism office in an ancient building called &quot;l&#x27;Orangerie&quot; (facing the public library). The town has a well-known archaeological and scientific society, and possesses a library with more than three hundred manuscripts, and a museum, mostly archaeological, in front of which stands a statue of the poet Pierre de Ronsard. There is also a statue of Marshal Rochambeau, born at Vendôme in 1725. Some interesting houses of the 15th and 16th centuries survive.

<doc id="187067" wikidata="Q166056" url="?curid=187067" title="Cardinal Mazarin">
<text>Jules Mazarin (born Giulio Raimondo Mazzarino or Mazarini; 14 July 1602 – 9 March 1661), from 1641 known as Cardinal Mazarin, was an Italian Catholic prelate, diplomat and politician who served as the chief minister to the Kings of France Louis XIII and Louis XIV from 1642 to his death. He was made a cardinal in 1641.

After serving as a papal diplomat for Pope Urban VIII, Mazarin offered his diplomatic services to Cardinal Richelieu and moved to Paris in 1640. After the death of Richelieu in 1642, Mazarin took his place as first minister of Louis XIII, and then of Louis XIV, when he succeeded to the throne in 1643. Mazarin acted as the head of the government for Anne of Austria, the regent for the young Louis XIV, and was also responsible for the king&#x27;s education until he came of age. The first years of Mazarin in office were marked by military victories in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, which he used to make France the main European power and establish the Peace of Westphalia (1646–1648). A major uprising against Anne of Austria and Mazarin, called the Fronde and led by the nobles of the Parlement of Paris, broke out in Paris in 1648, followed by a second Fronde, led by Louis, Grand Condé, who had turned from his chief ally to his chief enemy. Mazarin took Anne of Austria and Louis XIV out of Paris and then shifted his base to Germany for a time. Turenne, a general loyal to Louis XIV and Mazarin, defeated Condé, and Mazarin made a triumphal return to Paris in 1653.

The last years of Mazarin&#x27;s life, between 1657 and his death in 1661, were marked by a series of major diplomatic victories. In 1657 he made a military alliance with England. In 1658 he unveiled the League of the Rhine. The same year, Marshal Turenne decisively defeated the army of Condé at the Battle of the Dunes in Flanders. On 7 November 1659, Spain signed the Treaty of the Pyrenees, which added three new provinces to France. In 1660 Mazarin arranged the marriage of Louis XIV to Maria Theresa of Spain, which ended the long and costly wars between the Habsburgs and France. Exhausted by his diplomatic efforts, Mazarin died in 1661.

Mazarin, as the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of France for nearly two decades, played a crucial role in establishing the Westphalian principles that would guide European states&#x27; foreign policy and the prevailing world order. Some of the principles, such as the nation state&#x27;s sovereignty over its territory and domestic affairs and the legal equality among states, have remained the basis of international law to this day. In addition to his diplomacy, Mazarin was an important patron of the arts. He introduced Italian opera on a grand scale to Paris and assembled a remarkable art collection, much of which today can be seen in the Louvre. He also founded the Bibliothèque Mazarine, the first true public library in France, which is now found in the Institut de France, across the Seine from the Louvre.

==Early life==
Giulio Mazzarino was born on 14 July 1602 in Pescina in the Abruzzo region of Italy, about 120 km from Rome. His parents were residents of Rome, spending the summer in Pescina to escape the summer heat. His father, Pietro Mazzarino (1576–1654), had moved to Rome from Sicily in 1590 to become a chamberlain in the family of Filippo I Colonna, the Grand Constable of Naples. His father became a citizen of Rome in 1608. His mother Ortensia Bufalini (1575–1644) was a native of Rome, from the Bufalini family of nobility whose origins were in Città di Castello in Umbria. The family had moved to Rome in the Middle Ages. She was the goddaughter of Filippo I Colonna, her husband&#x27;s employer. Giulio was the eldest of six children, two boys and four girls.

Through the influence of the Colonnas, Giulio was admitted at the age of seven to the Jesuit College in Rome, the most respected school in the city. Though he declined to join their order, he excelled in his studies. In 1618, at the age of sixteen, he gave a public lecture on theories explaining Halley&#x27;s comet, which appeared in that year. He also excelled in theatrics; he was chosen to play the part of the newly sainted Ignatius of Loyola in a religious pageant. He also acquired the habit of gambling at cards, and was frequently in debt. A particular favourite game of his was a variant of Hoc named after him: Hoc Mazarin.

When he was twenty his father decided to send him away from the bad influences of Rome. Giulio accompanied Girolamo Colonna, one of the sons of Filippo I Colonna, who was eighteen, to the Complutense University of Madrid (then located in Alcalá de Henares) in Spain. He studied law with Girolamo during the daytime and in the evenings continued to gamble and again was in debt. A notary who had advanced some cash to cover gaming debts urged the charming and personable young Mazarino to take his daughter as bride, with a substantial dowry, and Giulio accepted. Girolamo Colonna wrote urgently to his father in Rome, and Giulio was ordered to return immediately to Rome, without his fiancée.

==Papal envoy==
Upon his return to Rome, he resumed his studies, this time in law. In 1628 he received the title of doctor &quot;in utroque jure&quot;, meaning he could practice both civil and canonical law. In the same year Ferdinand II, the Habsburg emperor, laid claim to a papal territory, the Valtellina, in the Italian alps. Pope Urban VIII raised an army to defend his territory. The Prince of Palestrina, who was also a member of the Colonna family, commanded a new regiment of the Papal army, and invited Giulio to become a lieutenant in the regiment. Since neither the regiment nor Giulio had any military experience, they were assigned to a town far from the front line. Giulio knew little of military discipline. He received a message from Rome informing that his mother was seriously ill. Without asking permission from his commander, he immediately rode to Rome, and stayed there until his mother had recovered. He was summoned before the Pope, Urban VIII, to explain why he had deserted his post. He threw himself at the feet of the Pope, and pleaded to be pardoned for his excess of loyalty to his family. The Pope was impressed by Giulio&#x27;s spontaneity and eloquence, forgave his desertion, and invited him to become a Papal emissary.

In 1628 Mazarin was named the secretary to Jean-François Sacchetti, a senior papal diplomat, who was trying to prevent the impending War of the Mantuan Succession between the armies of France and Spain for dominance of that region of northern Italy. Throughout 1629 and 1630 he shuttled between Milan, Mantua, Turin, Casale and France, trying to find a solution to the crisis before the fighting began. This became, throughout his career, his standard method of diplomacy; traveling continually, getting to know and win the trust of as many decision-makers as possible. During this time he came to know Cardinal Francesco Barberini, the head of diplomacy for the papacy, and, more important, Cardinal Richelieu of France, his future mentor, whom he first met in Lyon on 29 January 1630. Richelieu was aloof and confrontational; he wrote afterwards: &quot;This Mazarini is here more to spy than to negotiate...He is so Spanish and so Savoyard that what he says shouldn&#x27;t be taken as gospel truth.&quot;

Richelieu at first decided to ignore Mazarin&#x27;s diplomacy and to send the French army across the Alps into Italy. On 26 October 1630 the French and Spanish armies met outside the walls of the French-held town of Casale, ready to fight. Suddenly, a man on horseback with a flag appeared, galloping toward them, crying &quot;Pace! Pace!&quot; (&quot;Peace! Peace!&quot;) It was Mazarin, carrying an agreement from the Spanish commander to evacuate their soldiers from the town if the French would leave Montferrat to Charles Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. Mazarin brought together the Spanish and French commanders and explained the terms of the agreement, which were readily accepted by both sides. Mazarin had achieved his first diplomatic success.

The result of Mazarin&#x27;s first diplomatic efforts was the Treaty of Cherasco, 6 April 1631, in which the Emperor and the Duke of Savoy recognized the possession of Mantua and part of Monferrat by Charles Gonzaga and the French occupation of the strategic stronghold of Pinerolo, the gate to the valley of the Po, to the great satisfaction of Richelieu and King Louis XIII of France.

The Pope sent Mazarin to Paris at the beginning of 1631 to work out the final details of the agreement. He returned to France again from April to July 1632. He had his first interview with Lous XIII and with the Queen, Anne of Austria, in May 1632. He tried to persuade Louis XIII to send a military expedition to capture Geneva, the fortress of the Protestant movement, but the King, who had good relations with the Swiss cantons, rejected the idea. Mazarin returned to Rome in November 1632, and made a new friend and ally, Antonio Barberini, the nephew of the Pope and one of his chief diplomats, and his older brother, Francesco Barberini, the Cardinal Secretary of State. With their assistance, he established himself as a guardian of French interests in Rome, and then of papal interests in France. In 1632, he was named papal vice-legate at Avignon, appointed a prelate, and began to wear ecclesiastical dress, though he was not and never became a priest.

While in Rome, Mazarin sent regular gifts of flowers, perfumes and delicacies to the women of the French court, and more valuable gifts, including statues and Renaissance paintings, to Richelieu. In 1634 he was named nuncio extraordinary to Paris by Urban VIII, and entrusted with the mission of persuading Louis XIII to undertake a grand naval crusade against the Turks. The goal was to create a combined fleet of the ships of Christian nations to seize the Turkish ports around the Mediterranean. Mazarin, a realist, knew that, given the rivalries between European powers, this project would never take place.

A new crisis arrived on 19 May 1635; France declared war on the Habsburg rulers of Austria and Spain. Mazarin wrote later that he had done his best to persuade Richelieu to avoid a war. He wrote that in March 1635 he gave Richelieu all his reasons to maintain the peace. &quot;His Eminence told me, as he stood up,&quot; Mazarin wrote, &quot;that I courted Peace as if she were the woman of my dreams. Then he shook my hand, and concluded, &#x27;You are no longer on the side of France.&#x27;&quot; Mazarin returned to Avignon on 7 April 1636.

During all of his negotiations, Mazarin was very careful not to be too critical of the French court and Richelieu, and they remained in contact. In November 1636 he left Avignon to return to Rome, carrying instructions from Richelieu that made him a discreet ambassador for the king of France.

The atmosphere within the papal curia was hostile to France and to Richelieu; Spanish priests occupied many positions in the hierarchy and they considered him, with reason, an agent of France. When the Pope refused to send him back to France, or to represent the papacy at a peace conference, he wrote: &quot;I am not a subject of the King of France, but I believe I can truly say that the declarations of the Spanish have declared me to be French, so that with justice one can say that France is my country.&quot;

His position in Rome was increasingly difficult. He had the affection of Pope Urban VIII, but he was disliked by Cardinal Barberini, the chief of Papal diplomacy, and by the large contingent of Spaniards in the papal household. He spent his time collecting sculpture and other works of art which he sent to Richelieu for the Cardinal&#x27;s new palace in Paris. He considered serving the rulers of Savoy, Poland, or Queen Henriette of England, but in the end he decided to enter the service of Richelieu and France. However, Richelieu was in no hurry to bring him to Paris; he valued the diplomatic contributions Mazarin was making in Rome, as well as the art treasures he was acquiring. He kept Mazarin in Rome for two more years. Richelieu did one important favor for Mazarin; in October 1638 he put forward Mazarin&#x27;s name as a candidate for Cardinal when the next vacancy opened up. In December 1638, when a sitting Cardinal died, Mazarin was nominated as a Cardinal. He had to wait the entire year of 1639 before his new position was confirmed. Then on 14 December 1639, he departed Rome for the port of Civitavecchia, boarded an armed French ship to Marseille, and then traveled from Lyon to Paris, where he arrived on 5 January 1640.

==Cardinal and deputy of Richelieu==

When he arrived in Paris, Mazarin was welcomed warmly by the King, by Richelieu, and by the Queen, Anne of Austria, to whom Mazarin had regularly sent perfumes, fans, gloves and other gifts. The Queen was at this time pregnant with her second child, and it was already anticipated that she would be the regent when King Louis XIII died. Mazarin advised Richelieu on both political and cultural matters. He recommended artists to bring from Rome to Paris, and in 1640 he commissioned a bust of Richelieu from the sculptor Bernini in Rome, sending Bernini pictures of Richelieu. The bust of Richelieu arrived in August 1641. Mazarin declared that it was perfect, so lifelike that, as he wrote, &quot;it seemed about to speak&quot;, but French tastes did not approve of the Baroque style. The other members of the Court condemned the work, and Mazarin wrote back to Bernini, sending him more pictures of Richelieu and asking him to try again.

Richelieu sent Mazarin on several delicate diplomatic missions, including a long trip to Savoy to straighten out the tangled political affairs there: the regency of Christine, the Duchess of Savoy, and sister of Louis XIII, was challenged by her brothers-in-law, the princes Maurice and Thomas of Savoy. (See Piedmontese Civil War) Mazarin successfully secured Christine&#x27;s position, and established a solid alliance between Savoy and France. This task kept him away from Paris for nine months, until June 1641. On 16 December 1641, though he had not reached his fortieth birthday, he received what he most desired, he was formally made a Cardinal.

He had established a cordial relationship with Richelieu; Richelieu jokingly referred to him as &quot;Rinzama&quot; (an anagram of his name), or &quot;Nunzinicardo&quot; (&quot;dear little envoy&quot;), or, most frequently, &quot;Colmarduccio&quot;, or &quot;Colmardo&quot;. When was asked what it meant, he translated into French as &quot;Frère Coupechou&quot;, the term for a junior candidate monk who was assigned to chop cabbage in the kitchen of the abbey. However, he did not send Mazarin on the mission that he most wanted, as delegate of France to a Europe-wide peace conference. Richelieu&#x27;s attention was devoted to making war; Richelieu, who was elderly and in poor health, took the King, who was also in poor health, the court and Mazarin on a series of long military expeditions, to suppress a rebellion in Catalonia, to capture Roussillon, and, in January 1642, to lay siege to Narbonne.

On 11 June 1642, while in Tarascon on one of the long military expeditions, Mazarin was presented with evidence that Gaston, Duke of Orléans, the brother of Louis XIII, and the Marquis of Cinq-Mars, one of the King&#x27;s closest advisors, had made a secret agreement with the King of Spain, without the knowledge of Richelieu or the King. It appeared probable that the Queen, Anne of Austria, was also aware of this secret betrayal of Richelieu, but did not tell him or the King. Cinq-Mars was arrested, Gaston was disgraced, and another conspirator, the Duke of Bouillon, was granted a pardon on the condition of revealing all the details of the plot to Mazarin, and surrendering the important fortress of Sedan to the King. Mazarin did not reveal the participation of the Queen in the conspiracy, but his knowledge gave him even greater leverage at the court. The destruction of the conspiracy against the King was one of the last acts of Cardinal Richelieu. He fell ill and died on 4 December 1642.

==Chief minister of France – Diplomacy==
The succession of Mazarin to the position of chief minister of Louis XIII was not automatic or immediate. Despite the accounts of some later historians, Richelieu did not name Mazarin as his successor. Richelieu did, according to Mazarin himself, advise the King to employ Mazarin, who until that time had no official position at court.

After the death of Richelieu, Louis XIII named three prominent figures to advise him; François Sublet de Noyers, Léon Bouthillier, comte de Chavigny and Mazarin. Mazarin and de Chavigny immediately joined together to get rid of de Noyers. They hinted to the King that de Noyers had secretly made an agreement with Anne of Austria to make her the regent of France after the King&#x27;s death. The King, who had little love for the Queen and in his will had refused to make her his regent, was furious; de Noyers was forced to resign on 10 April 1643.

Louis XIII died 14 May 1643, just five months after Richelieu. His successor, Louis XIV, was just four years old. The King had specifically instructed that his wife, Anne of Austria, not rule in his place as regent. However, as soon as he was dead, she applied to the body of nobles known as the Parlement of Paris, and had his will annulled. She was declared Regent on 18 May. The Queen had a particular dislike of de Chavigny, the other chief advisor chosen by Louis XIII. He had been close to Richelieu and was the only real rival in experience to Mazarin. The evening that she became regent, she declared that Mazarin would be her chief minister and head of her government.

The management style of Mazarin was entirely different from that of Richelieu. The contrast was described by Cardinal Retz, the future enemy of Mazarin, in his Memoires: &quot;One saw on the steps of the throne, where the sharp and fearsome Richelieu had thundered rather than governed the people, a leader who is gentle, benevolent, and demands nothing...He has the spirit, the insinuation, the playfulness, the manners, but also a certain laziness...&quot;

Cardinal Retz and other rivals in the court underestimated Mazarin&#x27;s skills, energy and determination. Mazarin continued Richelieu&#x27;s costly war against the chief rivals of France in Europe, the Habsburgs of Austria and Spain. The victories of Condé and Turenne finally brought Austria to the bargaining table and ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War with the Peace of Westphalia (1646–48)

Mazarin&#x27;s policies also added Alsace (though not Strasbourg) to France. He settled Protestant princes in secularized bishoprics and abbacies in reward for their political opposition to the Habsburgs, building a network of French influence as a buffer in the western part of the Empire. In 1657, he made an attempt to get Louis XIV elected as Holy Roman Emperor. In 1658 he formed the League of the Rhine, which was designed to check the House of Austria in central Germany. In 1659 he made peace with Habsburg Spain in the Peace of the Pyrenees, which added to French territory Roussillon and northern Cerdanya—as French Cerdagne—in the far south as well as part of the Low Countries.

Towards Protestantism at home, Mazarin pursued a policy of promises and calculated delay to defuse the armed insurrection of the Ardèche (1653), for example, and to keep the Huguenots disarmed: for six years they believed themselves to be on the eve of recovering the protections of the Edict of Nantes, but in the end they obtained nothing.

There was constant friction with the pontificate of the Spanish Cardinal Pamphilj, elected pope on 15 September 1644 as Innocent X. Mazarin protected the Barberini cardinals, nephews of the late pope, and the bull against them was voted by the Parlement of Paris &quot;null and abusive&quot;; France made a show of preparing to take Avignon by force, and Innocent backed down. Mazarin was more consistently an enemy of Jansenism, in particular during the formulary controversy, more for its political implications than out of theology. On his deathbed he warned young Louis XIV &quot;not to tolerate the Jansenist sect, not even their name.&quot; After his death, Louis XIV did not appoint a new principal minister and instead governed himself, marking the beginning of a new era of centralized government in France.

==Discontent – The Fronde (1648–53)==
Mazarin&#x27;s long war against the Habsburgs, the final part of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, was successful, but the cost was enormous. Resentment grew against the Spanish Queen and her Italian prime minister, and culminated in the Fronde, a rebellion against the government by members of the nobility and discontented citizens of Paris, which lasted from 1648 until 1653.

Mazarin was forced to raise money by any means possible to support the war against the Habsburgs. His financial counselor was Michel Particelli d&#x27;Emery, also Italian. When taxes, loans, and the sale of titles did not bring in enough, he sought new sources of income. He discovered an old law dating to Henry IV which forbade Parisians to build houses outside the city limits. Since the city had grown well outside its old boundaries, in 1644 he imposed heavy fines on all those who lived outside the city limits. In addition, he taxed all merchandise being brought into the city. One measure caused particular resentment among the nobility; he imposed a special tax on all the nobles who served on the various royal courts and councils, amounting to four years of their fees.

===The Fronde of the Parliament===

The center of resistance was the Paris &quot;parlement&quot;, an ancient assembly of nobles which served as a high court of appeals. It was a period of rebellion against monarchs across Europe; independence movements appeared in the Spanish provinces of Catalonia and Portugal, a revolutionary seized power in Naples, and Charles I of England, the brother-in-law of Louis XIII, was deposed and executed in 1649. In Paris, the members of the &quot;parlement&quot; called a special session to debate Mazarin&#x27;s measures. The meeting was forbidden by Regent, Anne of Austria, but went ahead anyway. The &quot;parlement&quot; issued a charter, inspired by the writ of Habeas Corpus in England, which revoked the authority of the King&#x27;s justice officials, forbade any new taxes without the approval of the &quot;parlement&quot;, and declared that no royal subjects could be imprisoned without due process of law.

Mazarin recommended to the Queen that she listen to the &quot;parlement&quot; and modify her decrees, but she was furious at their opposition. She waited until the right moment to strike back. The occasion she chose was the celebration of a major victory of the French Army over the Spanish at the Battle of Lens in Belgium on 26 August 1648. On the day that a special mass was held at the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris to celebrate the victory, she gave orders to the Captain of her guards to arrest the leaders of the &quot;parlement&quot;, including the popular Pierre Broussel. News of the arrest quickly spread in Paris, and crowds came out into the street to protest and to build barricades. That evening Mazarin wrote in his journal, &quot;the &quot;parlement&quot; has performed the functions of the King, and the people have deferred to it entirely.&quot;

During the Fronde, the anti-Mazarin crowds of Paris enjoyed listening to &quot;Mazarinades&quot;, popular songs with verses mocking the Cardinal. Dozens were written and published, accusing him of virtually all possible faults and crimes. Mazarin had a sense of humor, and when the Fronde was finished, he had the best &quot;Mazarinades&quot; collected and performed in a concert at his palace.

The rebellion lasted for three years. It took its popular name, Fronde, from the children&#x27;s slings (&quot;frondes&quot;) which were used by the mobs in the Paris streets to hurl stones. It combined the anger of the Parisians against the new taxes with the resentment of the nobility against the reduction of their ancient privileges. It was led over time by an odd assortment of allies; Gaston d&#x27;Orleans, the brother of Louis XIII; Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé a brilliant general but poor politician, and the Cardinal Paul de Gondi, a consummate intriguer. Each of them had different goals, but all agreed that Mazarin should fall.

When the Fronde began, the French Army, commanded by the Prince de Condé was far from Paris, fighting the Austrians. Mazarin quickly sent an envoy to the Emperor in Vienna, calling for a truce and peace conference. The Peace of Westphalia, ending the war, was signed 24 October 1648. Despite the peace, disturbances continued in the streets of Paris. During the night of January 6, 1649, Mazarin secretly took the young Louis XIV, Anne of Austria and the court to the safety of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, just west of Paris. Mazarin then set to work intriguing to divide the different factions of the Fronde. His goal was to separate the members of the Parlement and the more radical Parisian street demonstrators, who were united only by their dislike of Mazarin and Anne of Austria.

As soon as the war was concluded, he brought Condé and his army back to Paris and placed the city under blockade. He then persuaded the &quot;Parlement&quot; that they had more to fear from an uprising of the &quot;Parisiens&quot; than they did from him. On 14 March 1649 Mazarin accepted many of the reforms demanded by the &quot;Parlement&quot;. In return, the Parlement supporters laid down their weapons and allowed Anne of Austria, the young Louis XIV and Mazarin to return to Paris.

===The Fronde of the Princes===
The &quot;Parlement&quot; accepted Mazarin and his government, but the Fronde was still not finished. Many &quot;frondeurs&quot; were unhappy with the compromise reached in 1649. Once in Paris, Condé made endless demands on Anne of Austria until she finally angrily dismissed him. One of the other leaders of the Fronde, Jean François Paul de Gondi, soon persuaded Condé to join him in bringing down both Mazarin and Anne of Austria. Mazarin had an excellent network of agents, and immediately learned of the plot. On 18 January 1650 Mazarin had Condé, Condé&#x27;s brother, Armand de Bourbon, prince de Conti and his brother-in-law, Henri II d&#x27;Orléans, duc de Longueville arrested.

The agreements of 1649 had brought peace to Paris, but the unrest of the Fronde continued in other parts of France. Opponents of Mazarin disrupted tax collection and administration. As the rebellion grew, Mazarin observed that the rebels were only united in opposition to him. He decided it was wisest to resign his position and leave France while he could. He had Condé freed from prison, and, after a long journey to different cities, settled in Brühl near Cologne, as the guest of the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne.

From Germany, he sent daily instructions to Anne of Austria and to his agents in France. The strategy was to sow distrust among the different factions of the Fronde. Mazarin&#x27;s instructions were carried out meticulously by Anne of Austria. His intrigues succeeded in preventing the proposed marriage between one of the leading Frondeurs, the Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti with Princess Charlotte-Marie of Lorraine, Mademoiselle de Chevreuse, another of his principal enemies in Paris. He was greatly aided by the political ineptitude of Condé, who offended many of his natural allies. Mazarin urged Anne of Austria to bring him back to Paris as soon as possible, &quot;to correct the greatest attack ever made against the royal authority&quot;.

Once back in Paris, Mazarin soon made an alliance with his old enemy, Cardinal Jean François Paul de Gondi. Condé departed to Bordeaux to gather reinforcements. He raised an army of Spanish and French soldiers, and marched on Paris, arriving on 2 July. The soldiers loyal to the Queen, commanded by Turenne, were waiting, and trapped Condé&#x27;s army against the walls of Paris. An ally of Condé, the Grande Mademoiselle, ordered the gates of the city opened to rescue Condé&#x27;s army. The battle was witnessed from the hills of Charonne by the young Louis XIV.

As soon as Condé&#x27;s soldiers entered Paris, he demanded an immediate purge of Mazarin&#x27;s supporters. Riots broke out around the Bastille, and were suppressed with great difficulty. The Presidents of the &quot;Parlement&quot;, now allies of Mazarin, demanded that the violence be stopped and that Condé take his army out of Paris. Reluctantly, Condé left the city, going to the Spanish Netherlands, pursued by Turenne.

Louis XIV, now of age to claim his throne, re-entered Paris in October 1652, accompanied by his mother and by Turenne. Mazarin had to wait longer to make his return, which was carefully orchestrated with his help. The Parlement de Paris was first transferred by Anne of Austria from Paris to Pontoise, to see how many members would accept her authority. A majority appeared at the meeting. Following the prepared plan, the Parlement respectfully asked that Mazarin be dismissed, and Anne of Austria agreed. Mazarin, knowing this was the plan, accepted this decision, and waited a respectful time in exile. He made his return to Paris in February 1653. He was welcomed with a triumphal banquet at the Hotel de Ville, where crowds earlier had demanded his downfall.

Once he was restored to power, Mazarin began arranging for his nieces, known as the Mazarinettes, to marry powerful French and Italian noblemen. In order to entice the prospective grooms to marry them despite their lower rank, Mazarin provided large dowries. Among his seven nieces, Laura Mancini and Anne Marie Martinozzi married into the royal House of Bourbon; Olympia Mancini married into the House of Savoy; and Laura Martinozzi married Duke Alfonso IV d&#x27;Este of Modena.

==Financing the Kingdom – Fouquet and Colbert==
Finding money was a primary preoccupation for Mazarin throughout his entire time as first minister. His new taxes on Parisians and the nobility had provoked the first Fronde, but the end of the Fronde did not resolve the problem. The government had borrowed huge amounts to finance the campaigns against the first Fronde and against Condé, and also had to pay for the continual travels of the Regent and the young King, and the elaborate festivities, parades, and cavalcades that accompanied their travel and every major event. The royal budget for 1653 was about 109 million &quot;livres&quot;, which amounted to eight hundred tons of silver or sixty tons of gold. Expenditures were the greatest between 1656 and 1659. Twenty-seven agreements were made with bankers, who loaned the government 98 million &quot;livres&quot; to supplement the money collected through ordinary taxes.

Following the death of his first finance minister, La Vieuville, on 2 February 1653, Mazarin chose a new minister, Nicolas Fouquet. At the age of twenty-five, Fouquet had inherited a very large fortune after the death of his young first wife, and an even greater fortune when he married the second time, to Marie-Madeleine de Castille, whose family was one of the wealthiest in Europe. Fouquet began as a master of receipts at age twenty, then an intendant to the army, then Procuror-General for the Parlement of Paris at the age of thirty-five.

Through his family connections, Fouquet had amassed a fortune of three to four million livres. One of the reasons for Fouquet&#x27;s rapid rise was his willingness to lend very large sums to Mazarin for his various projects. In November 1657 Mazarin needed 11.8 million livres to pay the Army of the North. Fouquet, drawing upon his wealthy relatives, was able to provide the money. In 1659 he provided another loan of five million livres. 

One effect of the enormous amount of money in the market during the period of the Regency of Anne of Austria and Mazarin was a decline in the value of the &quot;Livre tournois&quot;, the French royal unit of account, lost twenty percent of its value against the gold Florentine Florin coin. However, without the money lent by Fouquet and other aristocratic financiers, Louis XIV could never have accomplished his early military and diplomatic successes.

The great rival of Fouquet was Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who was also recommended to Louis XIV and brought into the government by Mazarin. Soon after he became an assistant to Mazarin, he wrote a &quot;mémoire&quot; to Mazarin, claiming that of the taxes paid by the people, not one-half reached the King. The paper also accused Fouquet of using royal funds for his own enrichment. Mazarin did not defend Fouquet; shortly before his own death, he agreed that Fouquet had to go. Shortly after Mazarin&#x27;s death, Fouquet was accused by Colbert of misuse of state funds, his property was confiscated, and he was put into prison until his death, with Colbert eventually taking his place.

==Personal wealth and purchase of titles==
In 1645, Marie Louise Gonzaga, the aunt of Charles Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, had been granted in marriage to Władysław IV of Poland. She and her family did not have enough money to pay the agreed upon dowry of 2,100,000 livres. As a result, they went deeply in debt to Louis XIV, and their duchies of Mayenne, Nevers, and Rethel were mortgaged for this purpose. The negotiations, begun by Chancellor Séguier, were taken over by Mazarin, probably because Séguier was unable to put together enough money. Through various machinations, Mazarin and Colbert were eventually able to force Charles to pay off these debts by selling to Mazarin in 1654, the duchy of Mayenne (for 756,000 livres), and in 1659, that of Nevers (valued at 1,800,000 livres, at a discount of 1,534,675 livres), as well as the duchies of Donzy and Rethel. Thus, on 18 October 1660, less than five months before his death, Mazarin was confirmed by letters patent, issued by the young Louis XIV, as duke and peer of France.

The personal fortune of Mazarin at the time of his death was immense, amounting to 35 million livres, not counting the sums he left to his nieces. It exceeded the second-greatest personal fortune of the century, that of Richelieu, worth some 20 million livres. About one third of the personal fortune of Mazarin came from some twenty-one abbeys around France, each of which paid him an annual share of their revenue. Unlike members of the nobility, he did not have any large estates; his only real estate was the palace in Paris which he purchased in 1649, and added several surrounding houses. It was valued at 1.2 million livres. Thirty-seven percent of his fortune was in easily transportable jewels and cash. Within the ebony cabinets of his rooms at the Louvre his heirs found 450 pearls of high quality, plus quantities of gold chains and crosses, and rings with precious stones, altogether adding another 400,000 livres. He left to his family jewels worth an estimated 2.5 million livres, and gave a collection of diamonds worth 50,000 livres to the new Queen, and a 14-carat diamond called &quot;The Rose of England&quot;, valued at 73,000 livres, to the Queen Mother. The most valuable legacies of all, including a set of eighteen diamonds known as the &quot;Mazarins&quot;, worth two million livres, were given to the young Louis XIV.

==Patron of the arts==
Mazarin was second only to Louis XIV as a patron of the arts in France in the 17th century. In 1648 he founded the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. After his death in 1661, the inventory of his art collection at the Mazarin Palace recorded 858 paintings, 128 statues, 185 busts, plus 150 carpets, 514 pieces of jewelry and fine silver, and 317 precious stones, not counting the famous Mazarin diamonds, which he left to Louis XIV. His collection included works by most of the major French and Italian artists of his time and before, going back to the Renaissance. His acquisitions included works by Poussin, Rubens, Corregio, Van Dyck, Titian, and many others, as well as the famous &quot;Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione&quot; by Raphael, which had belonged to Charles I of England, and had been bought by Richelieu. Just before his death, he visited his gallery for the last time with his deputy Brienne, and told him: &quot;Ah, my poor friend, I must leave all this. Farewell, dear paintings, which cost me so much and which I so much loved.&quot; Many of the paintings he owned are now in the Louvre.

The Palais Mazarin (Mazarin Palace) was created by Mazarin beginning in 1643, soon after he became first minister, when he rented four adjacent &quot;hôtels&quot; on the north side of the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs between the Rue Vivienne to the east and the Rue de Richelieu on the west and across from the Palais Royal, which was the King&#x27;s residence. He commissioned François Mansart to add a garden wing with two superimposed galleries running north from the west end of the easternmost building, the Hôtel Tubeuf, where he could display his art collection, including paintings and antique sculpture. Between 1645 and 1647 he commissioned the Italian painter Giovanni Francesco Romanelli to create scenes from the works of Ovid on the ceiling of the upper gallery (although much modified, now known as the Galerie Mazarine).

In 1721, the Palais Mazarin became the site of the King&#x27;s Library (Bibliothèque du Roi), now the Richelieu site of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Mazarin spent little time in his Palace; he lived most of the time in the Palais Royal, when Louis XIV was in residence there, or in the Louvre. Near the end of his life he resided in the Château de Vincennes, where he decorated a suite of rooms. He also had the moats of the chateau turned into a kind of zoo, with lions, tigers, bears and other exotic animals, for the amusement of the young King.

Mazarin also played an important role in bringing Italian music to Paris. Before Mazarin, Italian opera was very little known or appreciated in Paris. Louis XIII, Catherine de Medici and Marie de Medici had all brought Italian musicians to Paris, but Mazarin did it more systematically and on a much larger scale. After his arrival as a minister in 1643, he invited the famous soprano Leonora Baroni and the castrato Atto Melani. Melani doubled as a diplomat; Mazarin sent him on several secret missions to other courts in Europe.

Due to Mazarin&#x27;s efforts, seven Italian operas were performed in Paris between 1645 and 1662. In 1645 Mazarin brought to Paris the famous scenery designer Giacomo Torelli, who staged Sacrati&#x27;s opera &quot;La finta pazza&quot;. In 1647, for Carnaval, he staged a lavish production of the premiere of &quot;Orfeo&quot; by Luigi Rossi. Later on Torelli became involved more in the &quot;ballet de cour&quot; than in opera, reflecting the passion of the king for dancing. Torelli&#x27;s career in France came to a definitive end in 1661, when he worked on sets for Molière&#x27;s &quot;Les fâcheux&quot;, presented by Nicholas Fouquet as part of his grand fête at Vaux-le-Vicomte in honor of the King, the overly ostentatious display which ultimately led to Fouquet&#x27;s imprisonment.

Mazarin was also a famous collector of books. In 1646, he brought to Paris his collection of nine thousand volumes, which he installed in his residence. It was the second-largest library in Paris, second only to the library of the King. However, when Mazarin was forced to leave Paris during the Fronde, his library was seized by the Fronde leaders, and was dispersed. He then began a second library with what was left of the first. The library grew to over 25,000 volumes and was open to all scholars after 1643. It is recognized as the first true public library in France. In his will, he gave his library to the Collège des Quatre-Nations which he had founded in 1661. The original bookcases of his library were transferred to the reading room of the College of Quatre-Nations when it was built.

==Educator of Louis XIV==
From the eighth birthday of the young Louis XIV, Mazarin took the title &quot;Superintendent of the Royal Education&quot; and managed every aspect of the young King&#x27;s studies. All of the King&#x27;s activities were governed and scheduled by Mazarin; his time of rising, his prayers, his physical exercise (&quot;paume&quot; fencing, and dance) followed by a morning lesson in politics with Mazarin himself. In the afternoons he was charged to write an essay each day for Mazarin on what he had learned. The education he gave Louis was purely practical, not theoretical. Among other topics, he instructed the King in the fine art of dissimulation, or lying, when needed, and always, when making an agreement, to leave a way out.

Beginning in 1659, as the King reached the age of twenty-one, and Mazarin approached the end of his life, he wrote a series of guidelines in political affairs for the King. When the King set off on his journey to Spain to be married, Mazarin wrote to him: &quot;Remember, I ask you, what I have had the honor to tell you, when you asked me the way to take to become a great King...it is necessary to begin by making the greatest efforts to not be dominated by any passion...because, otherwise, if any misfortune arrives, regardless of what good will you have, you will not be able to do what has to be done.&quot;

Despite Mazarin&#x27;s instructions, Louis XIV continued to correspond with Mazarin&#x27;s niece Marie, with the tacit collusion of his mother. Mazarin immediately adopted a stricter tone: &quot;God established Kings...for watching over the well-being, safety and peace of their subjects; and not to sacrifice this well-being and safety for their personal passions...you must remember your responsibilities to God for your actions and for your safety, and to the world for the support of your glory and your reputation.&quot; Mazarin also threatened to depart France with his family if the King did not agree to stop communicating with Marie. In response, Louis wrote a new letter to his mother, promising that henceforth he would forget Marie and concentrate exclusively on &quot;the great occupation of King&quot;. (&quot;Grand metier du Roi&quot;)

==Final military and diplomatic accomplishments (1658–1661)==
The last years of Mazarin&#x27;s life, between 1658 and his death in 1661, were marked by a series of major diplomatic victories, including the marriage of Louis XIV. In 1658, after long and intense preparation, Mazarin unveiled the League of the Rhine, a new group of fifty small German principalities which were now linked by a treaty with France. They promised not to allow enemy forces pass through them to invade France. This treaty weakened both the old Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Empire of the Habsburgs, This gave a new measure of security to France&#x27;s eastern border. In the same month, Marshal Turenne decisively defeated the army of Condé at the Battle of the Dunes in Flanders. This marked the end of the threats to France from the north, from the Spanish Netherlands.

Negotiation of a draft peace treaty between France and Spain took place between February and June 1659, but many critical details remained unresolved. Mazarin and Spain&#x27;s Dom Luis de Haro personally took charge of the negotiations on 13 August. Their conferences, which continued for three months, were held on the French-Spanish border on the island of Faisans, midway between French Hendaye and Spanish Fuenterrabía, in the river Bidassoa. The resulting Treaty of the Pyrenees was signed on 7 November 1659 and added Artois, Cerdanya, and Roussillon as new provinces of France. It also provided for an even more important diplomatic event carefully arranged by Mazarin, the marriage of Louis XIV with Maria Theresa of Spain, the French celebration of which followed in June 1660 in nearby Saint-Jean-de-Luz. The couple made a triumphant entry into Paris on 26 August 1660. This marriage and accompanying agreements ended, at least for a time, the long and costly wars between the Austrians and France.

Mazarin, as the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of France, played a crucial role in establishing the Westphalian principles that would guide European states&#x27; foreign policy and the prevailing world order. Some of these principles, such as the nation state&#x27;s sovereignty over its territory and domestic affairs and the legal equality among states, remain the basis of international law to this day.

==Death==

In his last months, Mazarin resided mainly in the Louvre Palace. A large fire broke out in the Galerie des Rois, the main picture gallery of the Petite Galerie of the Louvre, and destroyed many pictures, greatly upsetting Mazarin. It was the beginning of his decline. When his doctor informed him that his end was near, Mazarin asked, &quot;How long?&quot; The Doctor replied &quot;two months.&quot; Mazarin responded, &quot;That&#x27;s enough.&quot;

Mazarin had already prepared several wills. Knowing that his enemies at court were telling Louis XIV that he was taking money that belonged rightfully to the King, his first will, which he made public, cleverly left all of his fortune to Louis XIV. Mazarin probably calculated that the King would be too embarrassed to take all of his mentor&#x27;s and chief Minister&#x27;s wealth. The King waited for three days, then refused to accept it. Mazarin had also prepared a different will, which left a large sum for the establishment of the Collège des Quatre-Nations, which he had founded for students from the four new provinces which he had added to the territory of France by the Treaty of Westphalia. The college, now the Institut de France, was eventually built directly across the Seine from the Louvre, where it is visible from the Palace. Mazarin asked that his remains be interred there, where they rest today in a marble monument beneath the dome. The college is home to the five French academies, including the Academie Française.

<doc id="187068" wikidata="Q7707865" url="?curid=187068" title="Texas Monthly">
<text>Texas Monthly (stylized as TexasMonthly) is a monthly American magazine headquartered in Downtown Austin, Texas. Founded in 1973 by Michael R. Levy, &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; chronicles life in contemporary Texas, writing on politics, the environment, industry, and education. The magazine also covers leisure topics such as music, art, dining, and travel. It is a member of the City and Regional Magazine Association (CRMA). 

After being sold to Emmis Publishing, L.P. in 1998, the magazine was later sold to Genesis Park LP in 2016 for $25 million, and is currently owned by Randa Williams . In 2021, &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; began expanding into video production through its acquisition of Phillips Productions, best known as the producers of &quot;Texas Country Reporter&quot;.

==Subject matter==
&quot;Texas Monthly&quot; takes as its premise that Texas began as a distinctive place and remains so. It is the self-appointed arbiter of all things culturally Texan, with past articles on Texas BBQ, the Texas Rangers (including Joaquin Jackson&#x27;s famous 1994 cover appearance), and Texas musicians.

&quot;Texas Monthly&quot;″s annual &quot;Bum Steer Awards&quot; poke fun at Texas politicians and policies, odd Texas-related news items and personalities from the previous year. Anna Nicole Smith (prior to her death) was a perennial &quot;winner&quot;. Other Bum Steer &quot;Hall of Famers&quot; include Ross Perot, Tom DeLay, and Jessica Simpson. It releases biennial lists with explanations of the &quot;Ten Best&quot; and &quot;Ten Worst&quot; Texas state legislators.

Since the establishment of the magazine, barbecue enthusiasts have been among the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; staff. The magazine&#x27;s first article about barbecue in Texas was published in 1973. The magazine often ranks what it considers to be the best barbecue restaurants in Texas. Calvin Trillin of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said in 2008 that East Texas barbecue often did not interest the Austin-based staff of the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;, who were more focused on Central Texas barbecue.

In December 2021, the magazine signed a three-year first-look deal with HBO and HBO Max.

==Headquarters==

It has its headquarters at 816 Congress Ave. in Downtown Austin. It occupies a area on the 17th floor of the building. it has about 80 employees.

Around 2009 the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; headquarters moved to University Park, on the site of the former Concordia University. The headquarters was scheduled to move to its current location in Downtown Austin in the summer of 2011.

Previously the headquarters was in Suite 1600 of 701 Brazos in Downtown Austin.

==Awards==
The magazine has received ten National Magazine Awards:
* General Excellence—2009, 2003, 1992, 1990
* Public Interest—1996, for &quot;Not What the Doctor Ordered&quot; by Mimi Swartz
* Photography—1990
* Reporting—1985, for &quot;The Man in the Black Hat&quot; (part 1 and 2) by Paul Burka
* Public Service—1980, for &quot;Why Teachers Can&#x27;t Teach&quot; by Gene Lyons
* Reporting—1979, for a three-part series by Richard West
* Outstanding Editorial Achievement in Special Journalism—1974

==Archives==
The complete archives of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; (1972–present) are located at the Wittliff collections of Southwestern Writers, Texas State University.

==Texas Monthly Press==

In the 1980s, Texas Monthly Press published such books as &quot;Goodbye to a River&quot; and &quot;Hank the Cowdog&quot; and authors such as Bud Shrake, Stephen Harrigan and Gary Cartwright. Gulf Publishing Company purchased Texas Monthly Press in 1989.

She began her career as part of a nightclub act before working in Broadway plays and musicals. Her success as Billie Dawn in the 1946 stage production of &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; led to her being cast in the 1950 film version for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. She was known for her performance on Broadway in the musical &quot;Bells Are Ringing,&quot; winning a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical and reprising her role in the 1960 film adaptation.

In 1952, Holliday was called to testify before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee to answer claims she was associated with communism.

==Early life==
Holliday was born Judith Tuvim (she took her stage name from &quot;yomim tovim&quot;, which is Hebrew for &quot;holidays&quot;) in New York City, the only child of Abe and Helen Tuvim (née Gollomb). Her father was executive director of the foundation for the Jewish National Fund of America (1951–1958), and a political activist who ran unsuccessfully six times between 1919 and 1938 as a Socialist Party candidate for the New York state Legislature. Her mother taught piano. Both were of Russian-Jewish descent. Judith grew up in Sunnyside, Queens, New York, and graduated from Julia Richman High School in Manhattan. Her first job was as an assistant switchboard operator at the Mercury Theatre, which was administered by Orson Welles and John Houseman.

==Early career==
Holliday began her show business career in 1938 as part of a nightclub act called The Revuers, whose other members were Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Alvin Hammer, John Frank and Esther Cohen. They played engagements in New York night clubs including the Village Vanguard, Spivy&#x27;s Roof, the Blue Angel, and the Rainbow Room, and the Trocadero in Hollywood, California. Leonard Bernstein, a friend of the group who shared an apartment with Green, occasionally provided piano accompaniment for their performances. In 1940, The Revuers released a 78-rpm album entitled &quot;Night Life in New York.&quot; The troupe filmed a scene for the 1944 Carmen Miranda movie &quot;Greenwich Village.&quot; Although the Revuers&#x27; performance was cut, Holliday was an unbilled extra in another scene. The group disbanded in early 1944. Holliday remembered her years in the Revuers as unpleasant, saying she was initially a bad actress and so shy that she vomited between shows. She found it difficult to perform on stage in smoke-filled rooms while patrons over-imbibed, heckled and fought with each other, but deemed entertainers successful if they persevered in such atmospheres.

In her first film role, Holliday played an airman&#x27;s wife in Twentieth Century Fox’s version of the U.S. Army Air Forces&#x27; play &quot;Winged Victory&quot; (1944). She made her Broadway debut on March 20, 1945, at the Belasco Theatre in &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot;, and was one of the recipients that year of the Clarence Derwent Award for Most Promising Female Actress.

In 1946, she returned to Broadway as the scatterbrained Billie Dawn in &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;. Author Garson Kanin wrote the play for Jean Arthur; but when Arthur left New York for personal reasons, Kanin selected Holliday, two decades Arthur&#x27;s junior, as her replacement. When Columbia bought the rights to adapt &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; to film, studio boss Harry Cohn initially would not consider casting the Hollywood unknown, even though Holliday received rave reviews for her Broadway performance. Kanin, along with George Cukor, Spencer Tracy, and Katharine Hepburn conspired to promote Holliday by offering her a key part in the Tracy-Hepburn film &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; (1949).

Cohn eventually relented and offered Holliday the chance to repeat her role for the film version, but only after a screen test (which at first was used only as a &quot;benchmark against which to evaluate&quot; other actresses being considered for the role). For her film performance in &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, Holliday won the first Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy; and at the 23rd Academy Awards, won the Academy Award for Best Actress, defeating Gloria Swanson, nominated for &quot;Sunset Boulevard;&quot; Eleanor Parker, for &quot;Caged;&quot; and Bette Davis and Anne Baxter, both for &quot;All About Eve&quot;.

Holliday starred opposite newcomer Jack Lemmon in his first two feature films, the comedies &quot;It Should Happen to You&quot; and &quot;Phffft&quot; (both 1954).

Film historian Bernard Dick summed up Holliday&#x27;s acting: &quot;Perhaps the most important aspect of the Judy Holliday persona, both in variations of Billie Dawn and in her roles as housewife, is her vulnerability...her ability to shift her mood quickly from comic to serious is one of her greatest technical gifts.&quot; Director George Cukor also observed that Holliday had &quot;that depth of emotion, that unexpectedly touching emotion, that thing which would unexpectedly touch your heart.&quot;

===Investigation for Communist sympathies===
In 1950, Holliday&#x27;s name appeared on a list of 151 &quot;pro-Communist&quot; artists in the conservative publication &quot;Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and TV&quot;. The next year, she was subpoenaed by Senator Pat McCarran&#x27;s Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, which was investigating subversion and Communist activity in the entertainment industry. Holliday was one of several actors accused of fundraising for Communist front organizations. She appeared before the committee on March 26, 1952, with Simon H. Rifkind as her legal counsel.

Holliday was advised to play dumb, as in her film portrayal of Billie Dawn, and she did – often to comedic effect. She denounced Stalinism and authoritarianism generally, but defended the free speech rights of those who espoused such views. Holliday later wrote of the experience to her friend Heywood Hale Broun: &quot;Woodie, maybe you&#x27;re ashamed of me, because I played Billie Dawn ... But I&#x27;m not ashamed of myself, because I didn&#x27;t name names. That much I preserved.&quot; The investigation &quot;did &quot;not&quot; reveal positive evidence of any membership in the Communist Party&quot;. The investigation concluded after three months and, unlike others whose careers were severely damaged by communist allegations, her career was relatively untarnished.

==Later career==
Holliday starred in the film version of &quot;The Solid Gold Cadillac&quot;, which was released in August 1956. In November 1956, Holliday returned to Broadway, starring in the musical &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; with book and lyrics by her Revuers friends, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and directed by Jerome Robbins. In 1957, she won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Of Holliday&#x27;s performance in the stage musical, Brooks Atkinson wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
Nothing has happened to the shrill little moll whom the town loved in &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;. The squeaky voice, the embarrassed giggle, the brassy naivete, the dimples, the teeter-totter walk fortunately remain unimpaired ... Miss Holliday now adds a trunk-full of song-and-dance routines...Without losing any of that doll-like personality, she is now singing music by Jule Styne and dancing numbers composed by Jerome Robbins and Bob Fosse. She has gusto enough to triumph in every kind of music hall antic.

Returning to her film career after a gap of several years, Holliday starred in the film version of &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (1960), her last film.

In October 1960, Holliday started out-of-town tryouts on the play &quot;Laurette&quot;, based on the life of Laurette Taylor. The show was directed by José Quintero with background music by Elmer Bernstein and produced by Alan Pakula. When Holliday became ill and had to leave the show, it closed in Philadelphia without opening on Broadway.

Holliday had surgery for a throat tumor shortly after leaving the production in October 1960. Her last role was in the stage musical &quot;Hot Spot&quot;, co-starring newcomers such as Joseph Campanella and Mary Louise Wilson, which closed after 43 performances on May 25, 1963.

==Personal life==
In 1948, Holliday married clarinetist David Oppenheim, later a classical music and television producer, and academic. Oppenheim struggled with his sexual orientation; Leonard Bernstein, a mutual friend, suggested that Oppenheim marry Holliday as a beard. (In 1943, Bernstein himself wrote in a letter to Oppenheim, then in the U.S. Army, that he had thought of marrying Holliday.) The couple had one child, Jonathan, before they divorced in 1957. In the late 1950s, Holliday had a long-term relationship with jazz musician Gerry Mulligan.

Holliday supported Henry Wallace in the 1948 presidential election and Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

In 1960, she was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6901 Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.

==Death==
Holliday died on June 7, 1965, at Manhattan&#x27;s Mount Sinai Hospital from metastatic breast cancer. She was interred in the Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

<doc id="187079" wikidata="Q942680" url="?curid=187079" title="Calvin Johnson (musician)">
<text>Calvin Johnson (born November 1, 1962) is an American guitarist, vocalist, songwriter, music producer, and disc jockey. Known for his uniquely deep and droning singing voice, Johnson was a founding member of the bands Cool Rays, Beat Happening, Dub Narcotic Sound System, The Go Team (not to be confused with The Go! Team) and The Halo Benders.

Calvin Johnson is also the founder and owner of the influential indie label K Records and has been cited as a major player in the beginning of the modern independent music movement.

== Career ==

=== Early years ===
Johnson was born in Olympia, Washington. His first introduction to underground culture was in 1977 when he became a volunteer at Olympia&#x27;s community radio station, KAOS-FM, at the age of fifteen. The station&#x27;s uniquely progressive programming policy mandated a focus on music available through independent and artist owned labels, rather than centralized corporate media. This independent, do-it-yourself ethos has been an important influence on Johnson&#x27;s career. Johnson soon began writing for fanzines, such as Sub/Pop (later to become Sub Pop Records) and Op, and also organized music and film events. Johnson attended The Evergreen State College in Olympia, where his first band, a short-lived group called Cool Rays, made their debut recordings with Steve Fisk in 1981. Calvin established K in the summer of 1982.

At some point, his father gave him a Martin acoustic guitar. He later told an interviewer that his father had &quot;received it as a wedding present from his bride.&quot;

=== Beat Happening ===
Johnson formed Beat Happening in 1982 with fellow Evergreen students Heather Lewis and Bret Lunsford. Beat Happening were early leaders in the American indie rock and lo-fi movements, noted for their use of primitive recording techniques, disregard for the technical aspects of musicianship, and songs with subject matters of a childish or coy nature. Instruments were guitar and drums, with members frequently switching instruments and Calvin and Heather taking turns on lead vocals. Tours with artists such as Fugazi confused and alienated audience members while articulating a punk rock position of defiance that was more sensitive than macho. The band has been on hiatus since 1992, but briefly resurfaced to release a new 7&quot; in 2001.

=== Go Team ===
The Go Team was a collaborative project started in 1985 based around the core duo of Johnson and Tobi Vail, later of Bikini Kill &amp; Kill Rock Stars. They toured the West Coast as a two piece, adding Billy Karren for two U.S. tours. The group released several cassettes and 9 singles on K, with a rotating cast of collaborators that included Kurt Cobain, Rich Jensen, David Nichols, and Donna Dresch. All of their recordings are currently out of print.

=== Dub Narcotic Sound System ===

Dub Narcotic Sound System, named after Calvin&#x27;s famed analog recording studio, was a project that explored funkier, more dance-party-oriented material in the tradition of the Stax/Volt house bands. Johnson was the sole member to appear on every recording, surrounded by a loose collective of musicians that&#x27;s included Larry Butler, Todd Ranslow, and Brian Weber (all members of hip-hop group Dead Presidents). Numerous 7&quot; singles and several full-length albums were released. The revolving door nature of the ensemble led to collaborations with Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Lois Maffeo and director/writer/performer Miranda July. The lineup later solidified around the trio of Johnson, bassist Chris Sutton (C.O.C.O, Hornet Leg, The Gossip) and drummer Heather Dunn (Tiger Trap). A catastrophic tour van crash in Montana in 2003 nearly ended the band&#x27;s career in tragedy. Johnson suffered a major concussion that left him with broken ribs and a serious speech impediment; he has since largely recovered. The band has not toured or released recordings since 2004&#x27;s &quot;Degenerate Introduction&quot;.
=== Halo Benders ===

Halo Benders was a collaboration between Johnson and Doug Martsch of Built To Spill. From 1994 to 1998, they released three albums. Calvin&#x27;s deep baritone voice and Doug&#x27;s high melodies are heard simultaneously, occasionally harmonizing, but often operating independently of one another. Despite the Halo Benders&#x27; critical and commercial success, Martsch&#x27;s commitment to touring with Built To Spill prevented the band from touring and recording more. The band reunited for a 2008 performance in Boise, and may be working on new material.

=== Solo career ===
Concurrent with his activity with Dub Narcotic Sound System, Johnson began performing solo shows under his own name. Calvin&#x27;s solo material was a marked contrast to the upbeat rock of Halo Benders and the funk-soul of DNSS, as it allowed him to explore mournful blues, folk, &amp; gospel elements.

His first solo album, &quot;What Was Me&quot;, is an introspective album about love, loss, and death. While some songs employ simple nylon-string guitar accompaniment, many feature only Johnson&#x27;s voice. It also contains duets with Beth Ditto of The Gossip and Mirah.

His second album, &quot;Before the Dream Faded...&quot;, is more varied. It includes collaborations with a variety of northwest indie luminaries. The songs cover an odd range of subjects, such as the size and color of hearts, Lucifer, and falling in love.

His third album &quot;Calvin Johnson &amp; The Sons of the Soil&quot; is a career-spanning collection of re-recorded songs with a band consisting of Kyle Field, Adam Forkner, and Jason Anderson, documenting that ensemble&#x27;s 2003 West Coast touring lineup.

His fourth album &quot;A Wonderful Beast&quot;, is true to Johnson&#x27;s long established vocal and poetic style with a more contemporary production value created in part by the records producer Patrick Carney of The Black Keys who also worked as a one-man backing band of guitars, drums, bass, and keyboards.

His fifth album, &quot;Gallows Wine&quot;, is an eclectic collection of songs reflecting this singular environment including “Pink Cadillac” written by Calvin when he was 16 (held in reserve for just the right session). Title song ”Gallows Wine” rips psycho psychedelic, poetic license intact. “Crazy Legs” is a Gene Vincent class act celebrating our sock hopulation and “Orange Aid” melts downtown no WAV. Calvin Johnson traveled to Columbus, Mississippi to record Gallows Wine with the combo Hartle Road at their Pompeii studio. Columbus, in Lowndes County, is the childhood home of Tennessee Williams (just down US Route 45 from White Station, birthplace of Howlin’ Wolf).

=== Current projects ===

In 2008, Calvin Johnson appeared in the film &quot;The Lollipop Generation&quot; by G.B. Jones.

Calvin&#x27;s newest project is Hive Dwellers, who made their recorded début performing Superchunk&#x27;s &quot;My Noise&quot; on &quot;SCORE! 20 Years of Merge Records: The Covers!&quot; A full-length release is planned for fall 2009.

Calvin has also revived his Dub Narcotic Disco Plate 45 rpm series, collaborating with artists such as Atlas Sound, Mahjongg, and Joey Casio at Dub Narcotic to record an A-side, and creating a Selector Dub Narcotic version for the b-side.

== Relationship with other musicians ==

After meeting Ian MacKaye in 1980, Johnson later became friends with the members of Fugazi, and Beat Happening was the opening band on one of Fugazi&#x27;s first tours.

Johnson has worked with Modest Mouse, Beck, Heavenly, The Microphones, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, The Blow, Jens Lekman, Mecca Normal, The Gossip, Built to Spill, and Fifth Column, among many others. Since founding his Dub Narcotic recording studio in 1993, he has produced and engineered recordings by many bands and artists.

Friends of Kurt Cobain such as Ian Dickson of Earth, Mark Arm of Mudhoney, Bruce Pavitt and Slim Moon have all acknowledged Johnson&#x27;s significant influence on the musician. Cobain cited Beat Happening&#x27;s &quot;Jamboree&quot; as one of his favorite records, and even got the K Records logo (a small &quot;K&quot; in a shield) tattooed on his arm to &quot;try and remind [&quot;him&quot;] to stay a child.&quot; They were friends in the late 80s/early 90s when Cobain lived in Olympia; he&#x27;d been a guest with The Go Team, and on September 25, 1990, Cobain appeared on a KAOS (FM) show hosted by Johnson and performed a number of songs, acoustically, including a duet with Johnson on the Wipers song, &quot;D-7.&quot; Cobain later grew to resent Johnson&#x27;s &quot;arrogance&quot; and denounced his ties in a (private) journal entry.

Johnson is also referred to in the John Peel session version of the Hole song, &quot;Olympia&quot; (also credited as &quot;Rock Star&quot; on the album &quot;Live Through This&quot;). The band&#x27;s lead singer, Courtney Love has the line: &#x27;I went to school with Calvin,&#x27; a reference to Johnson&#x27;s influence within the burgeoning Olympia indie music scene. In 1993, Johnson had a restraining order placed on Love for harassment and assault.

<text>Anne Baxter (May 7, 1923 – December 12, 1985) was an American actress, star of Hollywood films, Broadway productions, and television series. She won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe, and was nominated for an Emmy.

A granddaughter of Frank Lloyd Wright, Baxter studied acting with Maria Ouspenskaya and had some stage experience before making her film debut in &quot;20 Mule Team&quot; (1940). She became a contract player of 20th Century Fox and was loaned to RKO Pictures for the role of Lucy Morgan in Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942), one of her earlier films. In 1947, she won both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Sophie MacDonald in &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1946). In 1951, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for the title role in &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950). She worked with several of Hollywood&#x27;s greatest directors, including Billy Wilder in &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot; (1943), Alfred Hitchcock in &quot;I Confess&quot; (1953), Fritz Lang in &quot;The Blue Gardenia&quot; (1953), and Cecil B. DeMille in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), for which she won a Laurel Award for Topliner Female Dramatic Performance.

==Early life==
Baxter was born May 7, 1923, in Michigan City, Indiana, to Catherine Dorothy Baxter (née Wright; 1894–1979), whose father was the architect and designer Frank Lloyd Wright, and Kenneth Stuart Baxter (1893–1977), an executive with the Seagram Company. 

When Baxter was five, she appeared in a school play. When she was six, her family moved to New York, where she continued to act. She was raised in Westchester County, New York and attended The Brearley School.

At age 10, Baxter attended a Broadway play starring Helen Hayes where she was so impressed she declared to her family she wanted to become an actress. By age 13, she had appeared on Broadway in &quot;Seen but Not Heard&quot;. During this period, Baxter learned her acting craft as a student of actress and teacher Maria Ouspenskaya.

In 1939, she was cast as Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s younger sister in the play &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, although Hepburn did not like Baxter&#x27;s acting style, and Baxter was replaced during the show&#x27;s pre-Broadway run. Rather than giving up, she turned to Hollywood.

==Career==
===20th Century Fox===

At 16, Baxter screen-tested for the role of Mrs. DeWinter in &quot;Rebecca&quot;. Director Alfred Hitchcock deemed Baxter too young for the role, but the screen test brought her offers from MGM and 20th Century Fox. She chose to sign a contract with Fox because of their higher salary. In 1940, she was loaned to MGM for her first film &quot;20 Mule Team&quot;, in which she was billed fourth after Wallace Beery, Leo Carrillo, and Marjorie Rambeau. She worked with John Barrymore in her next film &quot;The Great Profile&quot; (1940) and appeared as the ingénue in the Jack Benny vehicle &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; (1941). She received star billing in &quot;Swamp Water&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Pied Piper&quot; (1942), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Baxter was loaned to RKO to appear in director Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942). She was Tyrone Power&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;Crash Dive&quot; (1943), her first Technicolor film. In 1943, she played a French maid in a North African hotel (with a French accent) in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot;, a Paramount production. She became a popular star in World War II dramas and received top billing in &quot;The North Star&quot; (1943), &quot;The Sullivans&quot; (1944), &quot;The Eve of St. Mark&quot; (1944), and &quot;Sunday Dinner for a Soldier&quot; (1944), co-starring her future husband John Hodiak. Baxter later recalled, &quot;I was getting almost as much mail as Betty Grable. I was our boys&#x27; idealized girl next door.&quot;

She was loaned to United Artists for the leading role in the film noir &quot;Guest in the House&quot; (1944), and appeared in &quot;A Royal Scandal&quot; (1945), with Tallulah Bankhead and Charles Coburn; &quot;Smoky&quot; (1946), with Fred MacMurray; and &quot;Angel on My Shoulder&quot; (1946), with Paul Muni and Claude Rains.

Baxter co-starred with Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney in 1946&#x27;s &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, for which she won both the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Baxter later recounted that &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; contained her only great performance, a hospital scene where the character Sophie &quot;loses her husband, child and everything else.&quot; She said she relived the death of her brother, who had died at age three.

She was loaned to Paramount for a top-billed role opposite William Holden in &quot;Blaze of Noon&quot; (1947) and to MGM for a supporting role as Clark Gable&#x27;s wife in &quot;Homecoming&quot; (1948). Back at 20th Century Fox, she played a wide variety of roles: a lawyer in love with Cornel Wilde in &quot;The Walls of Jericho&quot; (1948); Tyrone Power&#x27;s Irish romantic interest in &quot;The Luck of the Irish&quot; (1948); a tomboy in &quot;Yellow Sky&quot; (1948), with Gregory Peck and Richard Widmark; a 1920s flapper in &quot;You&#x27;re My Everything&quot; (1949), with Dan Dailey; and another tomboy in &quot;A Ticket to Tomahawk&quot; (1950), again with Dailey.
In 1950, Baxter was chosen to co-star in &quot;All About Eve&quot; largely because of a resemblance to Claudette Colbert, who originally was cast but dropped out and was replaced by Bette Davis. The original idea was to have Baxter&#x27;s character gradually come to mirror Colbert&#x27;s over the course of the film. Baxter received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for the title role of Eve Harrington. She said she modeled the role on a bitchy understudy she had for her debut performance in the Broadway play &quot;Seen but Not Heard&quot; at the age of 13 and who had threatened to &quot;finish her off.&quot;

Her next Fox film &quot;Follow the Sun&quot; (1951) co-starred Glenn Ford as champion golfer Ben Hogan; Baxter played Hogan&#x27;s wife Valerie. She was top-billed in the western &quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flat&quot; (1950), with Dale Robertson. Her final acting assignments at Fox were &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, with MacDonald Carey, and a segment in &quot;O. Henry&#x27;s Full House&quot; (1952), which featured an ensemble cast.

===Freelance===
In 1953, Baxter contracted a two-picture deal for Warner Brothers. Her first was opposite Montgomery Clift in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;I Confess&quot;; the second was the Fritz Lang whodunit &quot;The Blue Gardenia&quot;, in which she played a woman accused of murder.

She traveled to Germany to star in a drama film titled &quot;Carnival Story&quot; (1954). For MGM, she went to France to play the leading role in the crime drama &quot;Bedevilled&quot; (1955). At Universal-International, she made two films set in the Old West: &quot;One Desire&quot; (1955), with Rock Hudson and Julie Adams, and &quot;The Spoilers&quot; (1955), with Jeff Chandler and Rory Calhoun. Baxter was directed by her publicist and boyfriend, Russell Birdwell, in the independent film noir &quot;The Come On&quot; (1956), co-starring Sterling Hayden as her leading man.
Baxter won the part of the Egyptian princess and queen Nefertari (spelled Nefretiri in the film) in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s award-winning biblical epic &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956). Her co-stars included Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Rameses. Her scenes were shot on Paramount&#x27;s sound stages in 1955, and she attended the film&#x27;s New York and Los Angeles premieres in November 1956. Despite criticisms of her interpretation of Nefertari, DeMille and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; both thought her performance was &quot;very good&quot;, and &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; described her as &quot;remarkably effective&quot;. For her work in &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, she won a Laurel Award for Topliner Female Dramatic Performance. She later remembered the film in an interview:
She was reteamed with Heston in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Three Violent People&quot; (1956), co-starring Gilbert Roland and Tom Tryon. In the British mystery film &quot;Chase a Crooked Shadow&quot; (1958), she shared star billing with Richard Todd and Herbert Lom. She travelled to Australia to make &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; playing a part originally intended for Rita Hayworth.

In 1960, Baxter received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6741 Hollywood Boulevard. She played the role of Dixie Lee in the 1960 film adaptation of Edna Ferber&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;Cimarron&quot;.

===Later career===
Baxter worked regularly in television in the 1960s. She appeared as one of the mystery guests on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; She also starred as guest villain Zelda The Great in episodes 9 and 10 of the &quot;Batman&quot; series. She appeared as another villain, Olga, Queen of the Cossacks, opposite Vincent Price&#x27;s Egghead in three episodes of the show&#x27;s third season. She played an old flame of Raymond Burr on his crime series &quot;Ironside&quot;. Baxter made a guest appearance on &quot;My Three Sons&quot; season 8 episode 10, aired on November 4, 1967, called &quot;Designing Woman&quot;, portraying a glamorous female engineer who wanted Steve Douglas (Fred MacMurray) as a love interest and possible future husband.

Baxter returned to Broadway during the 1970s in &quot;Applause&quot;, the musical version of &quot;All About Eve&quot;, but this time as Margo Channing (succeeding Lauren Bacall).

In the 1970s, Baxter was a frequent guest and guest host on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. She portrayed a murderous film star on an episode of &quot;Columbo&quot;, titled &quot;Requiem for a Falling Star&quot;. In 1971, she had a role in &quot;Fools&#x27; Parade&quot; as an aging prostitute. In 1983, Baxter starred in the television series &quot;Hotel&quot;, replacing her &quot;All About Eve&quot; costar Bette Davis after the latter became ill.

==Personal life==

Baxter married actor John Hodiak on July 7, 1946, at her parents&#x27; home in Burlingame, California. The couple had one daughter, Katrina, born in 1951. They divorced in 1953. At the time, she said they were &quot;basically incompatible&quot;, but in her book she blamed herself for the separation. &quot;I had loved John as much&quot;, she wrote. &quot;But we&#x27;d eventually congealed in the longest winter in the world. Daily estrangement. Things unsaid. Even a fight would have warmed us. To my shame, I&#x27;d picked one at last in order to unfreeze the word &#x27;divorce&#x27;.&quot;
In the mid-1950s, Baxter began a relationship with her publicist Russell Birdwell, who took control of her career and directed her in &quot;The Come On&quot; (1956). The couple formed Baxter-Birdwell Productions to make films on a 10-year plan; Baxter would star in the films and Birdwell would work behind the camera. Princeton University Library has a collection of 175 letters by Baxter to Birdwell.

In 1960, Baxter married a second time to Randolph Galt, an American owner of a cattle station at Gloucester near Sydney where she was filming &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot;. After the birth of their second daughter, Maginel, back in California, Galt unexpectedly announced that they were moving to a ranch south of Grants, New Mexico. They then moved to Hawaii (his home state) before settling back in Brentwood, California. Baxter and Galt were divorced in 1969. In 1976, Baxter recounted her courtship with Galt (whom she called &quot;Ran&quot;) in a well-received book called &quot;Intermission&quot;. Melissa Galt, Baxter&#x27;s first daughter with Galt, became an interior designer and then a business coach, speaker, and seminar provider. Maginel became a cloistered Catholic nun, reportedly living in Rome. After 11 years in Italy and 20 years living monastic life, Maginel left religion altogether.

In 1977, Baxter married David Klee, a stockbroker. It was a brief marriage; Klee died unexpectedly from illness. The newlywed couple had purchased a sprawling property in Easton, Connecticut, which they extensively remodeled; however, Klee did not live to see the renovations completed. Although she maintained a residence in West Hollywood, Baxter considered her Connecticut home to be her primary residence.

Baxter was a Republican who was active in the campaigns of Thomas E. Dewey and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

==Death==
Baxter had a stroke on December 4, 1985, while hailing a taxi on Madison Avenue in New York City. She remained on life support for eight days in New York&#x27;s Lenox Hill Hospital, until family members agreed that brain function had ceased, and she died on December 12, at the age of 62.

<text>Eleanor Jean Parker (June 26, 1922 – December 9, 2013) was an American actress. She was nominated for three Academy Awards for her roles in the films &quot;Caged&quot; (1950), &quot;Detective Story&quot; (1951), and &quot;Interrupted Melody&quot; (1955), the first of which won her the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. She was also known for her roles in the films &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1946), &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1952), &quot;The Naked Jungle&quot; (1954), &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1955), &quot;A Hole in the Head&quot; (1959), &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Oscar&quot; (1966).

== Early life ==
Eleanor Jean Parker was born on June 26, 1922, in Cedarville, Ohio, the daughter of Lola (née Isett) and Lester Day Parker. She moved with her family to East Cleveland, Ohio, where she attended public schools and graduated from Shaw High School. &quot;Ever since I can remember, all I wanted to do is act&quot;, she said. &quot;But I didn&#x27;t just dream about it. I worked at it.&quot;

She appeared in a number of school plays. After graduation, she went to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard to work on her acting. She got a job as a waitress and was offered a screen test by 20th Century Fox, but turned it down. Wanting to focus on films, she moved to California and started appearing at the Pasadena Playhouse.

== Career ==
===Warner Bros===
She was in the audience one night at Pasadena Playhouse when spotted by a Warners Bros talent scout, Irving Kumin. He offered her a test, and she accepted; the studio signed her to a long-term contract in June 1941.

She was cast that year in the film &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot;, but her scenes were deleted. Her actual film debut was as Nurse Ryan in the short film &quot;Soldiers in White&quot; in 1942.

She was given some decent roles in the B films &quot;Busses Roar&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Mysterious Doctor&quot; (1943), and she had a small role in &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; (1943). This performance impressed Warners, so when Joan Leslie was held up on &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, Parker replaced her in &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot; (1944), playing the wife of Paul Henreid&#x27;s character.

She stayed in supporting roles for &quot;Crime by Night&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Last Ride&quot; (1944), then was given the starring role with Dennis Morgan in &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot; (1944), replacing Ida Lupino. She was given a cameo in &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944). Warners gave her the choice role of Mildred Rogers in a new version of Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1946). Although director Edmund Goulding called Parker one of the five greatest actresses in America, previews were not favorable, and the film sat on the shelf for two years before being released to an underwhelming reception. However, in 1953, Parker called it her favorite role.

Parker later said the &quot;big break&quot; of her career was when she was cast with John Garfield in &quot;Pride of the Marines&quot; (1945). &quot;It was a great part, and who wouldn&#x27;t look good with John Garfield&quot;, she later said. &quot;He was absolutely wonderful.&quot; However, two films that followed with Errol Flynn, the romantic comedy &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; (1946) and the drama &quot;Escape Me Never&quot; (1947), were box-office disappointments.

Parker was suspended twice by Warners for refusing parts in filmsin &quot;Stallion Road&quot; (where she was replaced by Alexis Smith) and &quot;Love and Learn&quot;.

She made the comedy &quot;Voice of the Turtle&quot; (1947, aired today under the title &quot;One for the Book&quot;) with Ronald Reagan and was in an adaptation of &quot;The Woman in White&quot; (1948). She refused to appear in &quot;Somewhere in the City&quot; (1948) so Warners suspended her again; Virginia Mayo played the role.
Parker then had two years off, and during this time, she married and had a baby. She turned down a role in &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; (1949), which she wanted to do, but it would have meant going to England, and she did not want to leave her baby alone during its first year. &quot;I probably received my salary for only six months during 1947 and 1948, but I can&#x27;t regret that&quot;, she said. &quot;All my life, I wanted a child, and anything that might happen to me professionally on that account would hardly seem a loss.&quot;

She returned in &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; with Humphrey Bogart. &quot;I&#x27;ve had my fling at roles that have little or no relation to most people&#x27;s lives&quot;, she said in a 1949 interview. &quot;I want to keep away from such assignments, as I can from now on, even though, as some may say, they mean exercising your skill and talent in acting.&quot;
Parker heard about &quot;Caged&quot; (1950), a film Warners was making of a woman in prison, and she lobbied the role. She got it, and won the 1950 Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award. She also had a good role in the melodrama &quot;Three Secrets&quot; (1950).

In February 1950, Parker left Warner Bros. after having been under contract there for eight years. Parker had understood that she would star in a film called &quot;Safe Harbor&quot;, but Warner Bros. apparently had no intention of making it. Because of this misunderstanding, her agents negotiated her release.

===Paramount===
Parker&#x27;s career outside of Warners started badly with &quot;Valentino&quot; (1951), where she played a fictionalized wife of Rudolph Valentino, and then she tried the comedy &quot;A Millionaire for Christy&quot; (1951) (originally called &quot;The Golden Goose&quot;).

In 1951, Parker signed a contract with Paramount for one film per year, with an option for outside films. This arrangement began brilliantly with &quot;Detective Story&quot; (1951) for director William Wyler, playing Mary McLeod, the woman who doesn&#x27;t understand the position of her unstable detective husband (played by Kirk Douglas); Parker was nominated for the leading actress Oscar in 1951 for her performance, which, to date, remains the shortest performance to be nominated in the category.

===MGM===
Parker followed &quot;Detective Story&quot; with her portrayal of an actress in love with a swashbuckling nobleman (played by Stewart Granger) in &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1952), a role originally intended for Ava Gardner. Parker later claimed that Granger was the only person she didn&#x27;t get along with during her entire career. However, they had good chemistry, and the film was a massive hit. MGM rushed her into &quot;Above and Beyond&quot; (1952), a biopic of Lt. Col. Paul W. Tibbets, Jr. (Robert Taylor), the pilot of the aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. It was a solid hit. While Parker was making &quot;Escape from Fort Bravo&quot; (1953), she signed a five-year contract with MGM.

She was named as star of &quot;My Most Intimate Friend&quot; and of &quot;One More Time&quot;, from a script by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin, but neither film was made. Back at Paramount, Parker starred with Charlton Heston as a 1901 mail-order bride in &quot;The Naked Jungle&quot; (1954), directed by Byron Haskin and produced by George Pal.

Parker returned to MGM where she was reunited with Robert Taylor in &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot; (1954) and the Western &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; (1955).

&quot;I maintain that if you work, believe in yourself, and do what is right for you without stepping all over others, the way somehow opens up&quot;, she said in 1953. &quot;By that, I don&#x27;t mean just sitting back. At Warners, they still have a mile-long list of my suspensions for refusing certain parts. Anyway, I never did a Western. Not once. It&#x27;s paid off too.&quot;

In a 1954 interview, she said her favorite films were &quot;Caged&quot; and &quot;Detective Story&quot; and her least favorite were &quot;Chain Lightning&quot;, &quot;Escape Me Never&quot;, &quot;Valentino&quot;, and &quot;The Woman in White&quot;. She had commitments to make two films per year at MGM and one per year at Paramount. &quot;Personally, I prefer to be under contract&quot;, she said.

MGM gave her one of her better roles as opera singer Marjorie Lawrence in &quot;Interrupted Melody&quot; (1955). It was a big hit and earned Parker a third Oscar nomination; she later said it was her favorite film.

Also in 1955, Parker appeared in the film adaptation of the National Book Award-winner &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1955), directed by Otto Preminger and released through United Artists. She played Zosh, a woman in a wheelchair and the wife of heroin-addicted would-be jazz drummer Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra). It was a major commercial and critical success.

In 1956, she was billed above the title with Clark Gable for the comedy &quot;The King and Four Queens&quot;, also for United Artists.

It was then back to MGM for two movies, both dramas: &quot;Lizzie&quot; (1957), in the title role, as a woman with a split personality, and &quot;The Seventh Sin&quot; (1957), a remake of &quot;The Painted Veil&quot;. Both films flopped at the box office, and as a result, Parker&#x27;s plans to produce &quot;L&#x27;Eternelle&quot;, about French resistance fighters, did not materialize.

===Later films, and transition into television and theatre===
Parker supported Frank Sinatra in the popular comedy &quot;A Hole in the Head&quot; (1959). She returned to MGM for &quot;Home from the Hill&quot; (1960), co-starring with Robert Mitchum, then took over Lana Turner&#x27;s role of Constance Rossi in &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot;, a 1961 sequel to the hit 1957 film. It was made by 20th Century Fox which produced &quot;Madison Avenue&quot; (1961) with Parker.

In 1960, she made her TV debut. &quot;I look for the quality story and for parts that I think will be good or fun. People told me I was crazy to do &quot;Hole in the Head&quot; and &quot;Home from the Hill&quot;, but both those pictures appealed to me. I did enough of the bad ones (films), while I was under contract – because I was being told to do them. That&#x27;s the problem with being under contract. You do the pictures, or be suspended. Now, I don&#x27;t want to work unless I have faith in the part. This has nothing to do with wanting to be famous, or anything like that. It&#x27;s just that I love acting.&quot;

In the early 1960s, she worked increasingly in television, with the occasional film role such as &quot;Panic Button&quot; (1964).

Parker&#x27;s best-known screen role was playing Baroness Elsa von Schraeder in the 1965 Oscar-winning musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

In 1966, she played an alcoholic widow in the crime drama &quot;Warning Shot&quot;, a talent scout who discovers a Hollywood star in &quot;The Oscar&quot;, and a rich alcoholic in &quot;An American Dream&quot;. From the late 1960s, she focused on television roles.
In 1963, Parker appeared in the medical drama &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; in the episode &quot;Why Am I Grown So Cold?&quot;, for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award as Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. In 1964, she appeared in the episode &quot;A Land More Cruel&quot; on &quot;Breaking Point&quot;. In 1968, she portrayed a spy in &quot;How to Steal the World&quot;, a film originally shown as the two-part concluding episodes of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;.

Parker starred with Michael Sarrazin and Gayle Hunnicutt in her final theatrical film of the 1960s, the tense thriller &quot;Eye of The Cat&quot; (1969), which was written by Joseph Stefano.

In 1969–1970, Parker starred in the television series &quot;Bracken&#x27;s World&quot;, for which she was nominated for a 1970 Golden Globe Award as Best TV ActressDrama. &quot;I wanted to do the series so I could stay put&quot;, she said. &quot;Every movie I&#x27;m offered is shot in Europe or Asia or somewhere. I&#x27;m tired of running around.&quot; Parker left the series after the first 16 episodes, citing the limited nature of her role.

After 1969, she worked steadily, but except for a small role in &quot;Sunburn&quot; (1979), her onscreen acting was on television. Parker appeared in the NBC series &quot;Ghost Story&quot; episode &quot;Half a Death&quot; (1972). Parker appeared in the TV movie &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Come Home in the Spring&quot; (1971) and on TV in &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (1972). She starred in other TV movies and made guest appearances on series such as &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. Her final TV role was in the 1991 TV movie &quot;Dead on the Money&quot;.

Concurrent with her TV career, Parker starred in a number of theatrical productions, including the role of Margo Channing in &quot;Applause&quot;, the Broadway musical version of the film &quot;All About Eve&quot;. The role originally was played in the musical by Lauren Bacall. In 1976, she played Maxine in the Ahmanson Theater revival of &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot;. She was replaced in the Circle in the Square Theatre revival of &quot;Pal Joey&quot; during previews.

For her contributions to the movie industry, Parker was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6340 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Personal life==
Parker was married four times:

She was the grandmother of actor Chase Parker.

Parker was raised a Protestant, and later converted to Messianic Judaism, a form of Christianity which takes on some Jewish characteristics, telling the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; columnist Kay Gardella in August 1969: &quot;I think we&#x27;re all Jews at heart...I wanted to convert for a long time.&quot; She embraced and was a supporter of Messianic Jewish philosopher, teacher, and commentator Roy Masters, owner of the Foundation of Human Understanding in Grants Pass, Oregon. In 1978, she wrote the foreword to Masters&#x27;s book &quot;How Your Mind Can Keep You Well&quot;.

Parker, a life-long Democrat, endorsed Adlai Stevenson for president in the 1952 presidential election.

<doc id="187086" wikidata="Q1451738" url="?curid=187086" title="Caged (1950 film)">
<text>Caged is a 1950 American film noir directed by John Cromwell and starring Eleanor Parker, Agnes Moorehead, Betty Garde, Hope Emerson, and Ellen Corby. It was nominated for three Academy Awards.

The film portrays the story of a young newlywed sent to prison for armed robbery. Her brutal experiences while incarcerated, along with the killing of her husband, transform her from a meek, naive woman into a hardened convict. The film&#x27;s subplot includes massive prison corruption.

&quot;Caged&quot; was adapted by Virginia Kellogg from the story &quot;Women Without Men&quot; by Kellogg and Bernard C. Schoenfeld. In 1948, the studio had originally intended the film to be a vehicle for Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, but financial differences intervened.

==Plot==
Married 19-year-old Marie Allen, is sent to prison after a botched armed robbery attempt with her husband, Tom, who is killed. While receiving her initial prison physical examination, she learns that she is two months pregnant.

Marie has trouble adjusting to the monotonous and cutthroat world of the women&#x27;s prison. She meets Kitty Stark, a murderous shoplifter, who promises Marie work as a thief when she is released. Kitty stresses the importance of toughness while incarcerated.

Informed that she may be paroled in ten months, Marie witnesses several prisoners who are granted parole but must remain in jail because their parole officers have not secured work for them. One such hopeless prisoner hangs herself. This steadily drains Marie&#x27;s hopes for an early release.

Despite the rule of sadistic matron Evelyn Harper, Marie gives birth to a healthy but premature baby. She plans to grant temporary custody to her mother with the intent of taking the child after she is released, but Marie&#x27;s stepfather will not allow the baby in his house. After Marie is denied parole, she tries half-heartedly to escape. She is not punished for the attempt, but the authorities force her to surrender her child for adoption.

The arrival of notorious criminal Elvira Powell triggers a rivalry with Kitty. Elvira bribes Harper to place Kitty in solitary confinement, where Kitty is beaten. When a kitten is found in the jail yard, Marie attempts to adopt it as a pet, but Harper tries to take the kitten, prompting the inmates to riot. The kitten is accidentally killed during the melee and Marie is punished for fighting with Harper.

Before taking Marie to a solitary-confinement cell, Harper shaves Marie&#x27;s head, symbolically stripping her of her innocence. Harper has disagreements with sympathetic reformist prison superintendent Ruth Benton, especially after the latest incident with Marie. Because Harper is a political appointee, the police commissioner refuses to fire her and instead asks for Benton&#x27;s resignation. When Benton declares that she will demand a public hearing, the resignation issue is dropped.

Kitty finally rejoins her fellow inmates after serving a month in solitary confinement, but she is distraught and mentally unstable. After being harassed by Harper in the prison cafeteria, Kitty stabs Harper to death as the inmates watch and make no attempt to stop it. Marie—now hardened by her exposure to career criminals and sadistic guards—encourages Kitty in the fatal assault.

Eligible for parole once again, Marie claims to have secured a job outside the prison. However, the job is simply a ruse to win her release so that she can join Elvira&#x27;s shoplifting gang. Marie leaves the institution a cynical, unscrupulous woman. After Marie is freed, an office assistant asks Benton what to do with Marie&#x27;s file. Benton replies: &quot;Keep it active. She&#x27;ll be back.&quot;

==Reception==

In 1950, &quot;Variety&quot; gave a mixed but predominantly positive review of &quot;Caged&quot;, characterizing it as a &quot;grim, unrelieved study of cause and effect&quot; that &quot;still adds up to very drab entertainment&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;Variety&quot; was very complimentary of nearly all aspects of the film&#x27;s production, including its direction, editing, set designs, music, and cast performances, especially those of Parker and Emerson: 

Another American reviewer in 1950, &quot;Film Bulletin&quot;, gave generally high marks as well to &quot;Caged&quot;. The publication contended that the film&#x27;s &quot;stark, gripping&quot; social commentary would be even more powerful if the &quot;dismal atmosphere&quot; of its storyline had at least a few contrasting lighter moments. “&#x27;Caged’”, &quot;Film Bulletin&quot; observed, &quot;is to penal institutions what &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; was to mental institutions and &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; to alcoholism.&quot;

In a much later review, critic Emanuel Levy in 2007 generally praised the film too:

&quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot; in 2014 favorably awarded &quot;Caged&quot; three out of four stars, describing the film overall as “stark” with &quot;remarkable&quot; performances.

==Accolades==
==In popular culture==
&quot;Caged&quot; is satirized in a 1977 &quot;SCTV&quot; comedy sketch as &quot;Broads Behind Bars&quot; with the character of Marie renamed &quot;Cheryl&quot; (and portrayed by comedian Catherine O&#x27;Hara). Cheryl is depicted as a teenager in the mid-to-late 1950s, who after smoking &quot;pot&quot; ends up in prison after being framed for armed robbery and also learns later that she is pregnant. The character of Kitty is played by Andrea Martin, while John Candy, in drag, plays the role of matron Harper (called &quot;Schultzy&quot;). A knife fight between Kitty and Harper occurs in the skit, instead of a fork as in the film, although both Kitty and Schultzy die. Kitty is fatally stabbed by Schultzy, and Schultzy is later killed by Cheryl. For her action, Cheryl is then told she can be released from prison, however, she responds by only laughing and declining the offer, echoing Kitty&#x27;s remark in the original film, “No dice!” The skit, in the end, presents itself not only as a parody of “women-in-prison” movies like &quot;Caged&quot; but also as a spoof of the anti-marijuana films that were presented to students in many American high schools during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

<text>Rafael Bracero Torres (born 1940 in Santurce, Puerto Rico) is a Puerto Rican sportscaster. Bracero graduated from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez then known as &quot;Colegio de Artes Mecánicas&quot; (College of Arts and Mechanical Arts - &quot;CAAM&quot; in Spanish) with a degree in civil engineering, and then he joined Puerto Rico&#x27;s Perez Perry &quot;Channel 11&quot; to cover sports as their main reporter.

The &quot;Perez Perry Network&quot; soon went bankrupt and then Bracero became the night sportscaster on WAPA-TV, a position in which he performed at for two years and a half. At WAPA TV, their night news edition sportscasters were considered by WAPA executives as being second string to their afternoon news edition colleagues, so Bracero would, for those two years and a half, perform under the shadow of Luis Rigual, WAPAs afternoon sportscaster. Nevertheless, he joined Rigual to cover boxing fights and other live sporting events, and in sports documentaries. When Rigual died in 1983, Bracero became his substitute on the afternoon news cast.

Still as a WAPA sportscaster, Bracero worked with the transmissions of BSN basketball games (which he shared with Manolo Rivera Morales and &quot;Fufi Santori&quot;), boxing telecasts, MLB baseball games and football games. In 1988, he assisted with WAPA&#x27;s transmission of the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. One of Bracero&#x27;s catchphrases during his basketball game telecasts was &quot;Eeel Canasto!!!&quot; (loosely translated to &quot;Theee basket&quot;!) which he pronounced in a way similar to Marv Albert&#x27;s &quot;from downtown!* and became a popular phrase in Puerto Rican jargon at the time.

Bracero performed for WAPA TV as a sportscaster until he retired during 2017. He has written various books and is also an engineer. He has interviewed many sports stars, and he has traveled often to do specials and documentaries for boxing fights, such as the one he did before the fight between Héctor Camacho and Edwin Rosario, and before Rosario&#x27;s bout with Julio César Chávez.

On October 18, 2012, WAPA Television honored Bracero for being the station&#x27;s main sportscaster during 30 years.

Also during 2012, Bracero, along with Juan González, Félix Trinidad, Felix Trinidad Sr. and others, became a member of the Puerto Rican Sports Hall of Fame.

== Personal ==
He is the son of Francisco Bracero Rodrıguez and Antonia Torres Clote.

<doc id="187091" wikidata="Q605867" url="?curid=187091" title="Detective Story (1951 film)">
<text>Detective Story is a 1951 American crime drama directed by William Wyler and starring Kirk Douglas that tells the story of one day in the lives of the various people who populate a police detective squad. The ensemble supporting cast features Eleanor Parker, William Bendix, Cathy O&#x27;Donnell, and George Macready. Both Lee Grant and Joseph Wiseman play large roles in their film debuts. The film was adapted by Robert Wyler and Philip Yordan from the 1949 play by Sidney Kingsley. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Academy Award for Best Director for Wyler, Best Actress for Parker, and Best Supporting Actress for Grant.

An angry New York detective is one of a precinct of cops in a grim daily battle with the city&#x27;s lowlife. Little does he realize that his obsessive pursuit of an &quot;abortionist&quot; is leading him to a discovery closer to home. The characters who pass through the precinct over the course of the day include a young petty embezzler, a pair of burglars, and a naive shoplifter.

==Plot==
The movie&#x27;s events occur over a single night in the detective bullpen of a police station. Detective Jim McLeod, whose violent criminal father drove his mother to insanity, nurtures a lifelong hatred of lawbreakers and is convinced that he has a flawless instinct for identifying criminals. He maintains a particular contempt for Dr. Karl Schneider, who McLeod is convinced has performed illegal abortions that have resulted in patient deaths. McLeod has persuaded Schneider’s assistant to implicate him in a police line-up. However, Schneider bribes her not to pick him out, infuriating McLeod.

Concurrently, several other cases are being processed in the bullpen. The detectives have arrested burglar Charley Gennini, who is revealed to be a psychopath with an extensive criminal record including murder and rape. McLeod also books a young man named Arthur Kindred, who has admitted stealing money from his employer to try to impress the girl he loves. Although the employer is sympathetic and wants to drop charges after he is repaid, McLeod refuses to release the remorseful Kindred, saying that leniency only leads to more crime. Despite evidence of Kindred&#x27;s kind nature, McLeod is unwilling to distinguish between a first time offender like Kindred and a dangerous repeat offender like Gennini.

McLeod misses another chance to establish Schneider’s guilt when a victim dies in hospital. Schneider boasts that he has sensitive knowledge about McLeod, who finally explodes in anger and brutally attacks him, requiring McLeod’s commanding officer Lt. Monoghan to escort Schneider to the hospital in an ambulance. Schneider, half-conscious, mentions the name Giacoppetti, in connection with a woman supposedly linked with McLeod.

When Schneider’s lawyer Endicott Sims arrives to protest the incident, he inadvertently lets slip that the woman Schneider was referring to is McLeod’s wife Mary. Monaghan has Mary brought to the station and interviews her in private. She denies any connections until Monaghan invites in Giacoppetti, who greets her by name.
The stricken Mary admits to her husband that years ago she had become pregnant by Giacoppetti. McLeod, who had been worried about her apparent infertility, cannot stomach the thought that it was caused by her abortion by Schneider, especially when Sims hints that there may have been more lovers. After McLeod accuses her of infidelity, Mary tells him he is cruel like his father was and leaves him. Suddenly, Gennini takes advantage of a distraction to steal an officer&#x27;s revolver, and he fatally shoots McLeod before being disarmed. Dying, McLeod instructs his partner to release Kindred and to tell his wife he begs her forgiveness. The local paper praises McLeod for dying &quot;in the line of duty&quot;.

Tying most of these events together is the presence of the &quot;Shoplifter&quot;, who is ignored by the police as they do their jobs. Lee Grant, in her film debut, was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

==Production==
Paramount bought film rights in 1949 for $285,000, plus a percentage of the profits. Alan Ladd was the first star linked to the project.

The film version omits details from the play pertaining to the criminal underworld and the dangers of a police state.

During production, the film had some trouble with the Production Code Authority. Plotlines involving the killing of police officers or references to abortion were not permitted by Production Code. Joseph Breen suggested that explicit references to abortion would be altered to &quot;baby farming&quot;. However, when the film was released, film critics still interpreted Dr. Schneider as an illicit abortionist. Breen and William Wyler suggested to the MPAA Production Code Committee that the code be amended to allow the killing of police officers if it was absolutely necessary for the plot. They agreed, and the code was amended, lifting the previous ban on cop-killing. Another noteworthy factor regarding the passing of this film is that, at the time that this film was made, the Production Code Administration&#x27;s primary concern about cop killing was in regards to &quot;Gangster&quot; films, in that there is conflict between the criminal and the police officer. The killing was not premeditated, which again, helped allow the Production Code Administration to pass the film.

Joseph Wiseman later played the titular role in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), the first James Bond film starring Sean Connery. Gerald Mohr portrayed Doc Holliday in the television series &quot;Maverick&quot; in the 1957 episode titled &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; starring James Garner and Marie Windsor.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
When the film was released, Bosley Crowther, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, lauded the film and the casting, writing, &quot;Sidney Kingsley&#x27;s play, &quot;Detective Story&quot;, has been made into a brisk, absorbing film by Producer-Director William Wyler, with the help of a fine, responsive cast. Long on graphic demonstration of the sort of raffish traffic that flows through a squad-room of plainclothes detectives in a New York police station-house and considerably short on penetration into the lives of anyone on display... In the performance of this business, every member of the cast rates a hand, with the possible exception of Eleanor Parker as the hero&#x27;s wife, and she is really not to blame. Kirk Douglas is so forceful and aggressive as the detective with a kink in his brain that the sweet and conventional distractions of Miss Parker as his wife appear quite tame. In the role of the mate of such a tiger—and of a woman who has had the troubled past that is harshly revealed in this picture—Mr. Wyler might have cast a sharper dame.&quot;

Critic James Steffen appreciated the direction of the film and the cinematography of Lee Garmes, writing &quot;While &quot;Detective Story&quot; remains essentially a filmed play, Wyler manages to use the inherent constraints of such an approach as an artistic advantage. The confined set of the police precinct is not simply a space where various characters observe each other and interact; it also contributes to the underlying thematic thrust and ultimately to the film&#x27;s emotional power. The staging of the individual scenes, which often plays on foreground-background relationships, is also augmented by Lee Garmes’ deep focus photography. (Wyler, of course, used deep focus photography extensively in the films he shot with Gregg Toland.)&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; felt the film adaptation was better than the original play.

===Awards and nominations===
==Distribution==

===Home media===
In a DVD review of the film, technology critic Gary W. Tooze, wrote, &quot;Absolutely stunning image. One of the best I have seen for a black and white film this year. Superb sharpness, shadow details and contrast. Standard Paramount bare bones release with no extras and a price tag for the frugal minded. The image and price make it a must own for &quot;Noir&quot; fans and everyone else too. Wyler direction sends the film to upper tier to join the DVD.&quot;

==Radio adaptation== 
On April 26, 1954, &quot;Detective Story&quot; was presented on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on NBC. Douglas and Parker starred in the adaptation.

<doc id="187092" wikidata="Q2432431" url="?curid=187092" title="Ceremonial mace">
<text>A ceremonial mace is a highly ornamented staff of metal or wood, carried before a sovereign or other high officials in civic ceremonies by a mace-bearer, intended to represent the official&#x27;s authority. The mace, as used today, derives from the original mace used as a weapon. Processions often feature maces, as on parliamentary or formal academic occasions.

== History ==

===Ancient Near East===

Ceremonial maces originated in the Ancient Near East, where they were used as symbols of rank and authority across the region during the late Stone Age, Bronze Age, and early Iron Age. Among the oldest known ceremonial maceheads are the Ancient Egyptian Scorpion Macehead and Narmer Macehead; both are elaborately engraved with royal scenes, although their precise role and symbolism are obscure. In later Mesopotamian art, the mace is more clearly associated with authority; by the Old Babylonian period the most common figure on cylinder seals (a type of seal used to authenticate clay documents) is a repeated type now known as &quot;The Figure with Mace&quot; who wears a royal hat, holds a mace in his left hand, and is thought to represent a generic king. Ceremonial maces are also prominently depicted in the royal art of Ancient Assyria, such as the Stela of Ashurnasirpal II and the Stela of Shamshi-Adad V, in which the Assyrian kings are shown performing rites or making religious gestures while holding a mace to symbolise their authority.

===Eastern Roman Empire===

Some officials of the medieval Eastern Roman Empire carried maces for either practical or ceremonial purposes. Notable among the latter is the &quot;protoallagator&quot;, a military-judicial position that existed by about the 10th century A.D. and whose symbols of office were reported by the Palaiologan writer Pseudo-Kodinos in the 14th century to include a silver-gilt mace (&quot;matzouka&quot;). At this time the duties of the &quot;protoallagator&quot; included commanding the Byzantine Emperor&#x27;s personal &quot;allagion,&quot; his military retinue. The ceremonial function of the mace may have passed to the late Roman Empire from the ancient Near East by way of Persia, and from there to other European cultures.

===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===

The earliest ceremonial maces in France and England were practical weapons intended to protect the King&#x27;s person, borne by the Sergeants-at-Arms, a royal bodyguard established in France by Philip II, and in England probably by Richard I, (c. 1180). By the 14th century, these sergeants&#x27; maces had started to become increasingly decorative, encased in precious metals. As a weapon, the mace fell out of use with the disappearance of heavy armour.

The history of the civic mace (carried by the sergeants-at-arms) begins around the middle of the 13th century, though no examples from that period remain today. The oldest civic mace in England (still remaining today) is that of Hedon. It was granted (along with an important charter) in 1415. At the time, ornamented civic maces were considered an infringement of one of the privileges of the king&#x27;s sergeants, who alone deserved to bear maces enriched with costly metals, according to a House of Commons petition of 1344. However, the sergeants of London later gained this privilege, as did later those of York (1396), Norwich (1403–1404), and Chester (1506). Records exist of maces covered with silver in use at Exeter in 1387–1388; Norwich bought two in 1435, and Launceston others in 1467 and 1468. Several other cities and towns subsequently acquired silver maces, and the 16th century saw almost universal use.

Early in the 15th century, the flanged end of the mace (the head of the war mace) was carried uppermost, with the small button bearing the royal arms in the base. By the beginning of the Tudor period, however, the blade-like flanges, originally made for offence, degenerated into mere ornaments, while the increased importance of the end with the royal arms (afterwards enriched with a cresting) resulted in the reversal of the position. The custom of carrying the flanged end upward did not die out at once: a few maces, such as the Winchcombe silver maces, which date from the end of the 15th century, were made to be carried both ways. The Guildford mace provides one of the finest of the fifteen specimens of the 15th century.

Craftsmen often pierced and decorated the flanged ends of the maces of this period beautifully. These flanges gradually became smaller, and by the 16th or early 17th century had developed into pretty projecting scroll-brackets and other ornaments, which remained in vogue until about 1640. The next development in the embellishment of the shaft was the reappearance of these small scroll-brackets on the top, immediately under the head of the mace. They disappear altogether from the foot in the last half of the 17th century, and remain only under the heads, or, in rarer instances, on a knob on the shaft. The silver mace-heads were mostly plain, with a cresting of leaves or flowers in the 15th and 16th centuries. In the reign of James I of England they began to be engraved and decorated with heraldic devices and similar ornamentation.

As the custom of having sergeants&#x27; maces began to die out about 1650, the large maces borne before the mayor or bailiffs came into general use. Thomas Maundy functioned as the chief maker of maces during the Commonwealth of England. He made the mace for the House of Commons in 1649. This mace is still in use today, though without the original head. The original head, which was not engraved with regal symbols, was replaced by one with regal symbols at the time of the Restoration of the monarchy. Oliver Cromwell referred to the House of Commons mace as &quot;a fool&#x27;s bauble&quot; when he dissolved the Rump Parliament in 1653.

== Commonwealth ==

Most Commonwealth countries were formerly part of the British Empire and continue the tradition of using a mace, especially to represent the authority of the Sovereign in the parliaments of the Commonwealth realms.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom there are thirteen surviving royal maces in the Crown Jewels, ten of which are kept in the Jewel House at the Tower of London, while three are on permanent loan to the Houses of Parliament. Each mace is about long and weighs an average of . The House of Commons can only operate lawfully when the royal mace – dating from the reign of Charles II – is present at the table. Two other maces dating from the reigns of Charles II and William III are used by the House of Lords: One is placed on the Woolsack before the House meets and is absent when a monarch is there in person. Two maces from the Jewel House are carried in the royal procession at State Openings of Parliament and British coronations. The Scottish Parliament and the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) have their own maces, as do local councils, mayors, and some universities.

=== Australia ===

The ceremonial maces of the Australian House of Representatives and the Australian Senate symbolise both the authority of each chamber and the royal authority of Australia&#x27;s monarch.

==== Senate ====

The ceremonial mace of the Australian Senate is the Black Rod. The ceremonial custodian of the Black Rod is the Usher of the Black Rod.

==== House of Representatives ====

The Serjeant-at-Arms of the Australian House of Representatives is the ceremonial custodian of the Mace of the House. At the beginning and end of every day the House sits, the Speaker of the House enters and leaves the House preceded by the Serjeant-at-Arms carrying the mace on his or her right shoulder. The mace represents the authority of the monarch, the speaker and the house itself and is usually taken with the speaker on ceremonial occasions. However, in the presence of the governor-general the mace is generally left outside and covered with a green cloth on the understanding that a symbol of royal authority is not needed where the Crown’s actual representative is present.

The current mace is made of gilded silver, and was a gift to the House from King George VI on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Federation in 1951. It was presented to the House by a delegation of members of the British House of Commons.

In May 1914, Labor MP William Higgs played a practical joke on the House by hiding the mace under one of the opposition frontbenches. It was not found for two hours, and police were called in as it was assumed to have been stolen. After initially denying his role in the incident, Higgs apologised to his colleagues the following week, stating he had acted in &quot;a spirit of frivolity&quot;. His admission that he was &quot;entirely to blame&quot; was met with cheers.

==== Queensland Parliament ====

A silver-gilt mace was produced for the Queensland Parliament in 1978 by Marples and Beasley of Birmingham, United Kingdom. It is long and weighs . The mace is inlaid with 15 sapphires, 9 opals, 6 amethysts and 2 garnets, all originating from the state of Queensland.

=== Bahamas ===

The ceremonial maces in the Bahamas symbolise both the authority of each chamber and the Royal authority of Charles III, the King of the Bahamas.

On 27 April 1965, a day known in the Bahamas as &quot;Black Tuesday&quot;, Lynden Pindling, then Opposition Leader, threw the 165-year-old Speaker&#x27;s Mace out of a House of Assembly window to protest against the unfair gerrymandering of constituency boundaries by the then ruling United Bahamian Party (UBP) government. The Speaker tried to restore order but he was reminded by Labour leader Randol Fawkes that the business of the House could not legally continue without the mace. The badly damaged mace was recovered by the police and returned to the House.

The House of Assembly reconvened with a temporary wooden mace loaned by Canada; this was the same temporary mace used by the House of Commons of Canada after it lost its own mace to a fire in 1916. The temporary mace ultimately returned to Canada freshly gilded. In November 1975, the House of Commons of the United Kingdom donated a new mace to the House of Assembly.

On 3 December 2001, Cassius Stuart and Omar Smith, leader and deputy leader of the Bahamas Democratic Movement, a minor political party, charged from the public gallery onto the floor of the House of Assembly and handcuffed themselves to the Mace in protest against &quot;unfair gerrymandering&quot; of constituency boundaries by the Free National Movement (FNM) government. The Mace was unable to be separated from the men and the sitting of the House had to be suspended. The pair were jailed for almost two days but no charges were brought against them.

=== Canada ===

The ceremonial maces in the Canadian Senate and House of Commons embody the authority each chamber derives from the country&#x27;s sovereign. It also represents the Royal authority of Charles III, the King of Canada. The current mace in the Commons is the fourth mace, a replica of the third one destroyed by fire at the Centre Block in 1916.

A similar practice is employed in each of the provincial and territorial legislatures, with a mace representing the sovereign&#x27;s authority and power in each of the respective legislatures.

==== Protocol surrounding the mace ====

In Canada, each of the legislatures follow a relatively standard protocol in relation to the ceremonial mace; the speaker of the house normally enters following a mace-bearer (normally the sergeant-at-arms), who subsequently sets the mace on the clerks&#x27; table to begin the sitting. When the sergeant-at-arms removes the mace from the table, the House has either adjourned, recessed, or been resolved into a committee of the whole. Before the reigning monarch or one of his or her representatives (the governor general or one of the lieutenant governors) may enter a legislative chamber, the mace must be completely hidden from view. This is done by draping the mace in a heavy velvet cloth, a procedure performed by the house pages. During the election of the speaker, the mace is removed from the table to show that the house is not fully constituted until the new speaker takes the chair and the mace is laid on the table.

==== History of the maces ====
The oldest documented use of a ceremonial mace in a legislature of a British North American colony was at the 1st General Assembly of Nova Scotia, which convened in 1758. The first mace was used by the Chamber of Upper Canada&#x27;s first Parliament in 1792 at Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) and then moved to York (now Toronto). This first mace was a primitive wooden implement, painted red and gilt and surmounted by a crown of thin brass strips. It was stolen by American troops as a prize of war during the Battle of York of the War of 1812 in 1813. The mace was stored at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and remained in the United States until 1934. It was returned to Ontario when President Franklin Roosevelt sent an order to Congress to return the mace. It was stored at the Royal Ontario Museum for a time, and is now located in the Main Lobby of the Ontario Legislative Building.

A second mace was introduced in 1813 and used until 1841.

The third mace was not purchased until 1845. In 1849, when the Parliament for the United Province of Canada was sitting in Montreal, it was stolen by a riotous mob, apparently intent upon destroying it in a public demonstration. It was rescued and returned to the Speaker, Sir Allan MacNab, the next day. Later, in 1854, the mace was twice rescued when the Parliament Buildings in Quebec were ravaged by fire. The mace continued to be used by the Legislative Assembly in Toronto, Quebec City and Ottawa until Confederation in 1867. The new House of Commons of Canada then adopted the mace, where it remained until 1916. The mace of the House of Commons was destroyed when the Centre Block burned down in 1916; all that remained was a fist-sized ball of silver and gold. In the immediate aftermath, the House of Commons used the surviving Senate mace, then the mace of the Ontario provincial legislature for three weeks, after which a wooden mace (later loaned to the Bahamas) was crafted and used. In June 1916, the City of London donated a new mace made with the remains of the one destroyed; this mace continues to serve.

Being a symbol of the power and authority of a legislative assembly, a precedent was set in 2002 as to the severity of acts of disrespect toward the mace in Canada and, by proxy, the monarch. After Keith Martin, federal Member of Parliament for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, seized the ceremonial mace of the House of Commons from the clerk&#x27;s table on April 17, 2002, the speaker of that chamber ruled that a &quot;prima facie&quot; breach of the privileges of the house had occurred, and contempt of the house been committed. Martin was not permitted to resume his seat until he had issued a formal apology from the bar of the house, pursuant to a motion passed in response to the incident.

==== Parliament of Ontario ====

The ceremonial mace of the Legislative Assembly is the fourth mace to be used in Upper Canada or Ontario. The first, second and third maces are mentioned above, and were used by the Parliament of Upper Canada and Union Parliament. Only the first survived with second unaccounted and third mostly destroyed in 1916 with remains used to produce the current House of Commons&#x27; mace.

After Confederation, the third mace was adopted by the new House of Commons of Canada. The current mace used in the Legislative Assembly was acquired in 1867. It was provided by Charles E. Zollikofer of Ottawa for $200. The mace is made of copper and richly gilded, a flattened ball at the butt end. Initially, the head of the mace bore the crown of Queen Victoria and in a cup with her monogram, V.R. When she was succeeded by Edward VII in 1901, her crown and cup were removed and a new one bearing Edward&#x27;s initials on the cup was installed. Eventually, it was replaced with the current cup which is adorned in gleaming brass leaves.

Through some careful detective work on the part of Legislative Assembly staff, the original cup with Queen Victoria&#x27;s monogram was recently found in the Royal Ontario Museum&#x27;s collection and returned to the Legislature. It is now on display in the Legislative Building.

In 2009, two diamonds were installed in the mace. The diamonds were a gift to the people of Ontario from De Beers Canada to mark the opening of the Victor Mine near Attawapiskat First Nation in northern Ontario. Three diamonds were selected from the first run of the mine. Two stones, one rough and one polished, were set in platinum in the crown of the mace while the third stone, also polished, was put on exhibit in the lobby of the Legislative Building as part of a display about the history of the mace.

==== Parliament of Quebec ====

The ceremonial mace of the National Assembly was made by Charles O. Zollikoffer in 1867, after the transfer of the maces of the Province of Canada to the new federal parliament in Ottawa. The current mace is of gold with a crown and a cross on its top as well as the letters &quot;ER&quot; () - added after 1952.

The mace was saved from a fire by Sergeant-at-Arms Gédéon Larocque in 1883 as well as recovered after being stolen in 1967.

=== Cook Islands ===

In 2023, the parliament of the Cook Islands adopted a ceremonial double-ended mace () in the form of a canoe paddle (), inspired by the combination of traditional forms used in both the northern and southern Cook Islands, on one side and a spear () on the other, with the emblem of the Cook Islands parliament in the middle. The mace was designed by Tangata Vainerere, the clerk of the Cook Islands parliament, and carved by Wireless Tomokino. It is 1.45 metres long, carved from polynesian mahogany, and covered with traditional tattoo motifs.

During sittings of the parliament it is placed by the Sergeant-at-Arms in the parliamentary chamber with the paddle end pointing toward the government benches, and the spear end pointed toward the opposition.

=== Fiji ===

On 10 October 1874, Fiji&#x27;s former king, Seru Epenisa Cakobau, gave his war club to Queen Victoria when the Deed of Cession by which the sovereignty of Fiji passed to the British Crown was signed, and the war club was taken to Britain and kept at Windsor Castle. In October 1932, King Cakobau&#x27;s war club was repatriated to Fiji, on behalf of the British king George V, for use as the ceremonial mace of the Legislative Council of Fiji.

The mace is a , a traditional Fijian club named for the type of hardwood tree it is made from, and was decorated with silver palm leaves and doves upon Cakobau&#x27;s conversion to Christianity. Cakobau gave the club the name , meaning &quot;The sedge blanket of the Queen of Bau (wife of the )&quot;.

The mace is used as a symbol of the authority of the Speaker of the Parliament of Fiji. It is carried into parliament by the mace bearer, and is always placed on the central table of the debating chamber with the head pointing toward the government benches. 

An image of the mace is used on the emblem of the Fijian parliament.

=== Guyana ===

The National Assembly, the sole chamber of the Parliament of Guyana, has a ceremonial mace. In March 1991, Isahak Basir, a member of the People&#x27;s Progressive Party (in opposition at the time), was expelled from parliament for removing the mace from its place on the table, and also for throwing his drinking glass at the Speaker.

=== India ===

&quot;Sengol&quot; is a gold-plated silver sceptre that is installed in India&#x27;s New Parliament House. Originally gifted to Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, by a delegation of holy men on 14 August 1947, the sceptre was housed in the Allahabad Museum for seven decades. In 2023, the sceptre was moved to the newly-constructed Parliament House by the government of Narendra Modi, who propagated an ahistorical narrative by claiming the &quot;Sengol&quot; as a symbol of the transfer of power from the British regime unto Indians.

The legislative bodies of several states, such as Tripura, also have ceremonial maces. The courts of various Indian princely states were recorded as having ceremonial maces too.

=== New Zealand ===
A ceremonial mace for the New Zealand House of Representatives has been used since 1866, when one was presented to Parliament by former Speaker Sir Charles Clifford. The mace is considered to be a symbol of the authority of both the Speaker and of the House, and is carried by the Serjeant-at-Arms.

The first mace was destroyed on 11 December 1907 when a fire consumed most of Parliament Buildings. A wooden mace made of pūriri and designed by the Government Architect was temporarily used until a new mace was gifted by then Prime Minister Joseph Ward in 1909 at the prompting of Speaker Arthur Guinness. This mace is the one currently in use.

The present mace is modeled on that of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, differing only in that one of the panels instead depicts the Southern Cross and the initials &quot;NZ&quot;. The mace is 1.498 metres long, made of sterling silver coated with 18 carat gilt gold and weighs 8.164 kilograms.

====Wellington====

The capital city of Wellington also possesses a silver-gilt ceremonial mace, gifted to it by its sister city of Harrogate in 1954, which is used during meetings of the Wellington City Council and on ceremonial occasions.
=== Singapore ===
The Parliament of Singapore has a mace which had been originally commissioned in 1954 by Governor John Nicoll for the Legislative Council of Singapore.

The mace head is a winged lion holding a trident. Just below the mace head, on the shaft of the mace are the crest of the coat of arms of the Colony of Singapore and the crest of Coat of arms of the United Kingdom, on opposite sides. The rest of the shaft is embossed with lion heads and Chinese junks, and the bottom of the shaft is decorated with waves and fish. The base of the mace depicts a gryphon&#x27;s head above a crown, the crest of the coat of arms of Stamford Raffles. An image of the mace appears on the crest of Singapore&#x27;s parliament.

=== South Africa ===

As a Dominion of the British Empire, the Union of South Africa House of Assembly used a mace modelled on that of the UK House of Commons from 1910 to 1961.

When South Africa became a republic outside the Commonwealth in 1961, a Stinkwood mace was used temporarily until 1963 when the Gold Producers&#x27; Committee of the Transvaal and Orange Free State Chamber of Mines gifted a mace to the chamber.

In 2004 a new mace was designed to reflect the history, tradition, diversity, culture and languages of South Africa. Based on an aluminium shaft with a gold drum featuring images of working South Africans, the mace remains in use today as the symbol of the authority of the National Assembly of South Africa.

=== Sri Lanka ===

The ceremonial jeweled mace, symbolizing the authority of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, is kept in the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms. The mace, when kept on its stand in the Chamber, signifies that the House is in session. At the commencement of a Session, the Serjeant-at-Arms bearing the mace accompanies the Speaker when entering and leaving the Chamber. The mace has to be legally brought into the House at the appointed time and removed at the end of the Session. Therefore, unauthorized removal of the mace cannot invalidate proceedings.

=== Other maces with Connection to the British monarch ===

There are two maces in Jamaica, made in 1753 and 1787; one belonging to the colony of Grenada, made in 1791, and the speaker&#x27;s mace at Barbados, dating from 1812.

==Ireland==
===Mace of former Parliament of Ireland ===
A mace made in 1765 for the Irish House of Commons is long and weighs and became redundant in 1801 with the creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1937, the Bank of Ireland bought the mace from the descendants of John Foster, its last Speaker, the House having ceased to exist upon the Acts of Union 1800. The bank paid IR£3,100 for the mace at a Christie&#x27;s auction. In 2015, it represented Ireland at the 800th anniversary of the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show in the City of London.

=== The Great Mace of Dublin ===
The Great Mace of Dublin is used at major civic and ceremonial events alongside the Great Sword, such as when the Lord Mayor awards the honorary Freedom of the city. It was made in 1717 and contains parts of an earlier mace made for the city&#x27;s first Lord Mayor, Sir Daniel Bellingham.

===Academic maces===
The ceremonial mace of Trinity College Dublin was still in use in 2021, and University College Cork also has a mace and a mace-bearer.

==Myanmar (Burma)==

A ceremonial mace was an essential item of the regalia of Myanmar&#x27;s legislative bodies during the British colonial period. It kept its significance and symbolism in the early post-independence legislatures. Parliamentary democracy ceased in 1962, but when the regime of General Ne Win revived a one-party unicameral legislature in 1974, the mace-bearing ceremonial was abandoned. It was re-introduced in the new parliament, or Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, convened under the 2008 National Constitution.

==Philippines==

The House of Representatives and the Senate of the Philippines each have a respective mace. The maces are almost identical.

The mace of the House of Representatives serves as a symbol of authority and in the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms. It serves as a guarantee for the Sergeant-at-Arms in enforcing peace and order in the House upon the Speaker&#x27;s instruction. Upon every session, the mace is placed at the foot of the Speaker&#x27;s rostrum. The mace is topped by the official seal of the House of Representatives.

The mace of the Senate serves as a symbol of authority. It is displayed at the Senate President&#x27;s rostrum every session. As with the House of Representatives, the Sergeant-at-Arms also serves as the custodian of the mace. When there is disorderly conduct in the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms brings the mace from its pedestal and presents it to the senators causing the disorder, a signal to stop such behavior. The official seal of the Senate tops the mace.

Provincial boards, city and municipal councils also have their own mace.

The constitutional body Commission on Appointments also uses their own mace during their plenary sessions.

==United States==


The civic maces of the 18th century follow the British type with monarchical imagery, with some modifications in shape and ornamentation, while later maces incorporated either republican or imperial Roman imagery. 

The current Mace of the United States House of Representatives has been in use since December 1, 1842. It was created by William Adams at a cost of $400 to replace the first mace, which was destroyed on August 24, 1814, when the Capitol was destroyed in the burning of Washington by the British during the War of 1812. A simple wooden mace was used in the interim.

The current mace is nearly four feet tall and is composed of 13 ebony rods tied together with silver strands criss-crossed over the length of the staff. This design shows the staff with the appearance of a bundled fasces, sans ax, symbolizing unity, the rods representing the 13 original States. It is surmounted by a globus, symbolising dominion, and above that the American eagle with outstretched wings.

When the House is in session, the mace stands in a cylindrical pedestal of green marble to the right of the chair of the Speaker of the House. When the House is meeting as the Committee of the Whole, the mace is moved to a pedestal next to the desk of the Sergeant at Arms. Thus Representatives entering the chamber know with a glance whether the House is in session or in committee.

In accordance with the Rules of the House, when a member becomes unruly the sergeant-at-arms, on order of the speaker, lifts the mace from its pedestal and presents it before the offenders, thereby restoring order. This occurs very rarely.

Other, examples of English silver maces in North America include one dating to 1754 at Norfolk, Virginia, and the mace of the state of South Carolina, dating to 1756, which has monarchical imagery. The Maryland House of Delegates also has a very old ceremonial mace, although it is the plainest of all, having no ornamentation save some carved vegetation designs at its head. The Mace of the Virginia House of Delegates also has monarchical motifs, though it was not created until the 1970s.

==Bands==

Drum majors carry a mace to convey commands or signals to their band. According to the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association, &quot;Drum Major’s maces have been in existence since the 17th century&quot;.

==Churches==

Among other maces (more correctly described as staves) in use today are those carried before ecclesiastical dignitaries and clergy in cathedrals and some parish churches. Other churches, particularly churches of the Anglican Communion, a verger ceremoniously precedes processions.

In the Roman Catholic Church maces used to be carried before Popes and Cardinals. They have long since been replaced with processional crosses.

==Universities==

Ceremonial maces, symbols of the internal authority over members and the independence from external authority, are still used at many educational institutions, particularly universities. The University of St Andrews in Scotland has three maces dating from the 15th century. The university also has four other maces of a more recent origin. These are on permanent display at the Museum of the University of St Andrews. The University of Glasgow has one from the same period, which may be seen in its arms. University of Innsbruck and its sister Medical University are in possession of maces from 1572, 1588 and 1833, which were confiscated by the Habsburgs from the University of Olomouc in the 1850s.

At the University of Oxford there are three dating from the second half of the 16th century and six from 1723 and 1724, while at the University of Cambridge there are three from 1626 and one from 1628. The latter was altered during the Commonwealth of England and again at the Stuart Restoration. The mace of the general council of the University of Edinburgh has a three-sided head: one with the seal of the university; one with the university&#x27;s coat of arms and the third with Edinburgh&#x27;s coat of arms of the City of Edinburgh. The wood for the shaft of the mace is from Malabar and was presented by the Secretary of State for India (R. A. Cross) at the First International Forestry Exhibition (1884). The mace of the Open University reflects its modernist outlook, being made from titanium.

In the United States, almost all universities and free-standing colleges have a mace, used almost exclusively at commencement exercises and borne variously by the university or college president, chancellor, rector, provost, the marshal of the faculty, a dean or some other high official. In those universities that have a number of constituent colleges or faculties, each college, faculty or school often has a smaller mace, borne in procession by a dean, faculty member or sometimes a privileged student. In 1970, Cornell professor Morris Bishop was acting as marshal at a graduation ceremony when a radical student attempted to grab the microphone; Bishop fought him off with the mace.

In Canada, some universities have a mace that is used as part of the ceremonial process of conferring degrees during convocation and other special events. The mace is carried by a special university official like a beadle.

In South Korea, Pohang University of Science and Technology has a mace as a part of its ceremonial functions.

In the Philippines, the University of Santo Tomas has a pair of twin maces belonging to the Rector Magnificus. These symbolize his spiritual and temporal power as the highest authority of the university. Made of pure silver and measuring 95 centimeters by 15 centimeters in diameter, the maces have existed since the 17th century and have been used in academic processions ever since. Candidates for doctoral degrees were accompanied by the Rector in a parade called &quot;Paseo de los Doctores&quot; from Intramuros to Santo Domingo Church, where University commencement exercises were held until the 17th century. Today, faculty members hold processions at the opening of each academic year and during solemn investitures in academic gowns, following the style of Spanish academic regalia. The maces, carried by beadles or macebearers, were included in the parade for their academic symbolism.

==Other maces==

*The mace of the Cork guilds, made by Robert Goble of Cork in 1696 for the associated guilds of which he had been master, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The museum also has a large silver mace dating to the middle of the 18th century, with the arms of Pope Benedict XIV. This mace is said to have been used at the coronation of Napoleon as King of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy at Milan in 1805.
*The Judiciary of Hong Kong opens its legal year with a silver ceremonial mace carried by the mace bearer and used since the early 20th century with the butt end replaced with the emblem of the SAR in 1997. All of the court&#x27;s maces (pre and post Handover) are held in the Exhibition Gallery.
*Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks also had a ceremonial mace, called a &quot;bulava&quot;.
