<text>Bronco is a Mexican grupero band originating from Apodaca, Nuevo León originally composed of band members José Guadalupe &quot;Lupe&quot; Esparza, Ramiro Delgado, Javier Villareal, and José Luis &quot;Choche&quot; Villareal. As with many grupera bands, members wore band jumpsuits.

== History ==
=== Los Broncos de Apodaca ===
The band began by the name of &quot;Los Broncos de Apodaca&quot; (The Broncos of Apodaca), formed and fronted by José Guadalupe Esparza, whose origins lay within a band by the name of &quot;Cheyenne,&quot; which he had started with his childhood friends in secondary school. “I have always favored the names of Indians and although we never played professionally with that group, it helped us learn to play with cardboard boxes”, Esparza once stated in an interview about his beginnings in music. This eventually proliferated into Los Broncos de Apodaca. Esparza was joined by childhood friend Erick Garza and brothers Javier and José Luis &quot;Choche&quot; Villareal. Esparza was the vocalist and frontman, Javier was the main guitarist, Jose Luis played drums, and Erick on keyboards. Esparza occasionally took to percussion. At that time, they played Chicano music, whose rhythm is very similar to norteño music found in Northern Mexico, including Nuevo Leon, only that the organ is used instead of the accordion; it was considered to be a fashionable musical trend at that time, they also played cumbias and boleros.

The members of what would become Bronco went by the name Los Broncos de Apodaca since it was customary to include the state or region from which they originated. The inspiration for the name came from Estadio Adolfo Lopez Mateos stadium, which hosted the Broncos de Reynosa team of Mexican League baseball, and was known colloquially as &quot;Estadio de los Broncos&quot;. Their first professional gig was precisely in Agua Fría, Nuevo Leon, a town within the same municipality as Apodaca.

They recorded &quot;Quiero Decirte&quot; and &quot;Grande de Caderas&quot; on sides A and B respectively. The members of the group visited radio stations within the City of Monterrey, fronting themselves as a &quot;Bronco&quot; and requesting their music be played on the air. Their single was only aired on AM station XEOK.

=== Bronco (1979–1997) ===
Their first complete album was recorded for Fama, and included the song &quot;Quiero Decirte&quot;. This is the only production in which Manuel Caballero acted as drummer, leaving the group shortly after. Esparza left the role of playing percussion to his brother, Aurelio. In 1985, the song &quot;Sergio el Bailador&quot; album &quot;Sergio el Bailador&quot; became a radio hit. Songs like “Pilar de Cantina” and “Maldito Corazón”, both from the same album, also experienced vast commercial success of their own in Mexico and the United States. Due to health problems and to dedicate more time to his family business, Erick Garza decided to leave Bronco. His place was taken by Ramiro Delgado, a member of another group, Los Cazadores, who was recommended by Bronco&#x27;s producer from BMG-Ariola, Homero Hernández.

The first studio album recorded with Delgado was 1987&#x27;s &quot;Bronco Super Bronco,&quot; which included tracks &quot;Lo Tengo Decidido&quot;, &quot;No Nos Vamos a Olvidar&quot;, and &quot;La Rompidita&quot;.

In 1987, the group had garnered local fame within the State of Nuevo León and was invited to Salon la Fama in Monterrey. The event attracted a crowd exceeding capacity, with 9,000 people attending the hall with a maximum capacity of 4,000. &quot;It was a tall, long room, it had no windows and it had no emergency exit,&quot; according to one of the members of the band at the time. Police officers fired rounds into the air, causing a stampede in which hundreds were injured and seven died. The track &quot;Cumbia Triste&quot; on the 1989 album &quot;Un Golpe Mas&quot; was dedicated to the victims of the event.

Bronco experienced international fame with help from their international hit single &quot;Que No Quede Huella&quot;&quot; (&quot;May No Traces Be Left&quot;&quot;) from their 1989 album &quot;A Todo Galope&quot;, for which they toured in the United States, Puerto Rico, Spain, Argentina, Venezuela, and Peru, amongst other countries.

After the release and widespread success of &quot;A Todo Galope&quot; and the midst of the creation and distribution of &quot;Bronco Amigo&quot;, Bronco were acclaimed as the most eminent group in their category in both Mexico and the United States.

They gained additional fame in 1993, with their appearances in the Televisa soap opera, &quot;Dos Mujeres, un Camino&quot; (&quot;Two Women, one Path&quot;), alongside other celebrities, including Erik Estrada, Laura León, Lorena Herrera, Selena and Bibi Gaytán. In addition to acting, they performed the opening song of the same name, &quot;Dos mujeres, un camino&quot;. The album &quot;Pura Sangre&quot;, published by Disa Records, included the song &quot;Dos Mujeres, un Camino&quot;&quot;&quot;, earned gold and platinum records throughout Latin America.

The band announced their farewell tour in January 1997, with their first performance of this farewell tour taking place in February 1997 in New York. They would continue performing through 1997. Members affirmed there was no other reason than them having completed their cycle. In August 1997, they received the keys of the City of Dallas for their popularity amongst the Latino community. For their final performance in Monterrey, band members considered Estadio de Béisbol Monterrey but ultimately decided to use the local exposition in July. A final concert in 21 December in the Estadio Azteca stadium in Mexico City, attended by roughly 100,000 people, was held. The concert caused the stadium to reach full capacity.

By the end of 1997, Bronco had received 37 gold and 20 platinum records.

=== Return ===
In 2003, the band members announced a return to the public in May 2003 as El Gigante de America after baseball champion&#x27;s Arturo Gonzales&#x27;s final game with the Monterrey Sultans before his retirement. The band had recorded &quot;Estoy a Punto&quot; as the lead single for their new album by that time. They briefly went on a tour before releasing &quot;Siempre Arriba&quot; as their comeback album in the summer of 2003. They intended to use the name Bronco in Mexico again but were unable, due to a legal dispute over the copyrighted band name with their former manager. Subsequently, they chose to go by the name El Gigante de America, this being the nickname their fans gave them during their time as Bronco. Despite not being able to perform as Bronco in Mexico, the band used Bronco: El Gigante de America internationally, as Mexican copyright laws did not apply abroad.

=== El Gigante de America ===
In February 2012, original member, keyboardist and accordionist Erick Garza was kidnapped for ransom and murdered in Monterrey, Nuevo León.

José Luis Villarreal (&quot;Choche&quot;) died on September 30, 2012, at age 55, in Apodaca, Nuevo León, Mexico. He had suffered for his last few years with cirrhosis.

===Bronco (2017–present)===
After negotiation between their record labels, including Sony Music, and their former manager in 2017, they have been legally permitted to perform as Bronco in Mexico.

In April 2019, Ramiro Delgado left the band and filed a lawsuit against Lupe Esparza, accusing the latter of fraud and monetary mismanagement. Esparza was interviewed and claimed that all debt owed to Ramiro Delgado was being taken care of. Delgado&#x27;s son, Ramiro Delgado Jr., replaced his father as Bronco&#x27;s keyboardist and accordionist. On January 5, 2021, Ramiro Delgado Jr. left the band on his own accord, with Esparza claiming that the rest of the band attempted to convince him to stay, but ultimately respected his decision, as it came as no surprise.

In September 2019, , a Spanish language television series first aired, featuring the history of Bronco with the use of characters based on real individuals, while also making use of fictional characters loosely based on their counterparts in Esparza&#x27;s book, &quot;Cicatrices de un Corazón Bronco&quot;.

Bronco has sold over 12 million records as of 2017.

On January 12, 2021, Arsenio Guajardo was presented as new keyboardist and accordionist for the band. Guajardo previously worked with Los Trotamundos and Los Humildes.

<doc id="195533" wikidata="Q1412471" url="?curid=195533" title="Religious education">
<text>In secular usage, religious education is the teaching of a particular religion (although in the United Kingdom the term &quot;religious instruction&quot; would refer to the teaching of a particular religion, with &quot;religious education&quot; referring to teaching about religions in general) and its varied aspects: its beliefs, doctrines, rituals, customs, rites, and personal roles. In Western and secular culture, religious education implies a type of education which is largely separate from academia, and which (generally) regards religious belief as a fundamental tenet and operating modality, as well as a prerequisite for attendance.

The secular concept is substantially different from societies that adhere to religious law, wherein &quot;religious education&quot; connotes the dominant academic study, and in typically religious terms, teaches doctrines which define social customs as &quot;laws&quot; and the violations thereof as &quot;crimes&quot;, or else misdemeanors requiring punitive correction.

The free choice of religious education by parents according to their conviction is protected by Convention against Discrimination in Education.

Religious education is a contentious topic everywhere. Some nations, including the United States, neither publicly support religious education nor include religion in the curriculum. In other contexts, such as the United Kingdom, an &#x27;open&#x27; religious education has emerged from Christian confessionalism that is intended to promote general religious literacy without imparting a particular religious perspective.

==Overview==
Since people within a given country often hold varying religious and non-religious beliefs, government-sponsored religious education can be a source of conflict. Countries vary widely in whether religious education is allowed in government-run schools (often called &quot;public schools&quot;). Those that allow it also vary in the type of education provided.

People oppose religious education in public schools on various grounds. One is that it constitutes a state sponsorship or establishment of whatever religious beliefs are taught. Others argue that if a particular religion is taught in school, children who do not belong to that religion will either feel pressure to conform or be excluded from their peers. Proponents argue that religious beliefs have historically socialized people&#x27;s behavior and morality. They feel that teaching religion in school is important to encourage children to be responsible, spiritually sound adults.

== Religious education by religion ==
=== Christianity ===
In some denominations of Christianity, catechesis refers to the religious instruction of children and adult converts.

The Church Educational System of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) provides religious education for the youth and adults in 135 countries.

=== Islam ===
In religious Islamic schools children are taught to read and sometimes speak Arabic and memorize the major suras of the Qur&#x27;an. In the early 19th century Arabic still had a reputation as the universally understood language of science and medicine in the Islamic world while vernacular languages were spoken only in their respective countries.

In an architectural and historical context, the term generally refers to a particular kind of institution in the historic Muslim world which primarily taught Islamic law and jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;), as well as other subjects on occasion. The origin of this type of institution is widely credited to Nizam al-Mulk, a vizier under the Seljuks in the 11th century, who was responsible for building the first network of official madrasas in Iran, Mesopotamia, and Khorasan. From there, the construction of madrasas spread across much of the Muslim world over the next few centuries, often adopting similar models of architectural design. 

The madrasas became the longest serving institutions of the Ottoman Empire, beginning service in 1330 and operating for nearly 600 years on three continents. They trained doctors, engineers, lawyers and religious officials, among other members of the governing and political elite. The madrasas were a specific educational institution, with their own funding and curricula, in contrast with the Enderun palace schools attended by Devshirme pupils.

===Judaism===
Jewish religious education mainly takes two forms: firstly, education regarding the main tenets of the faith and secondly, education regarding the laws and customs of the religion. The ultra-orthodox followers of Haredi Judaism teach only Jewish law and customs to their students, refraining from teaching any secular studies. The followers of Modern Orthodox Judaism, on the other hand, teach both secular studies and religious studies, with an emphasis on mixing Jewish values from the halakha with the secular, modern world. About Jewish religious education in a secular society, Michael Rosenak, an Israeli philosopher of Jewish education, asserts that even when non-religious Jewish educators insist that the instruction of Judaism is not only a religious matter, they agree that “the religious factor” was very important to its culture before secularism dawned on society, and that “an understanding of natural history and literature requires a sense of historical Jewish sensibility.

==Approaches in various regions==
===Dominican Republic===
The Dominican Republic is a Christian state. Religious education classes must be of either a Catholic or evangelical Protestant basis and are required be taught in all elementary and secondary public schools. 

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, &quot;Religious Education&quot; refers to the academic teaching of religious studies. &quot;Religious Instruction&quot; refers to religious faith teaching, which occurs in private religious schools, integrated (religious) state schools or sometimes within Secular NZ State Primary Schools if directed by the individual schools&#x27; Board of Trustees. In 2017 around 40% of NZ State Primary Schools carried out religious instruction classes.

There are no officially recognised syllabuses as the school has to be officially closed in order to allow the classes to go ahead. There are organised groups such as the Secular Education Network and the NZ Association of Rationalists and Humanists, who are actively lobbying Government to have legislation changed to remove the classes from state primary schools.

===East Asia===
====China====
In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, formal religious education is permitted. Religious education usually occurs in scheduled sessions in private homes. Religious teachers usually move on a weekly or monthly circuit, staying as guests in private houses in exchange for teaching.

====Japan====

In Japan, religious or political education, or clubs that promote a specific religious or political group, are prohibited at public schools. Private schools with a traditional connection to Buddhist sects generally do not mandate any religious study. There are many Christian schools and universities with mandatory religious education. Any religious education at private middle and high schools requires the teacher to be accredited by a university teaching the religious education standards.

===Iran===
About 90 percent of Iranians practice Shi&#x27;ism (Islam), the official religion of Iran. Sunni and Shi&#x27;i are the two largest branches of Islam, with the overwhelming majority of Iranians practicing Shi&#x27;i Islam.

The main religion which is being taught to students in Iran is Islam and its holy book called Quran. Students start to learn it at the elementary and secondary school (typically ages 7–14) and it is compulsory for them to learn it. The government tries to hire teachers who are kind and convincing in order to teach religious content step by step to students. Other religions are not taught in public schools. There are some private schools for the recognized minority groups who have other religions, that is Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Judaism. These schools are supervised by the Ministry of Education which imposes certain curriculum requirements. The directors of these private schools must be Muslim, with few exceptions.

===Europe===

====Austria====
Because of Austria&#x27;s history as a multinational empire that included the largely Islamic Bosnia, Sunni Islam has been taught side by side with Roman Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox classes since the 19th century. However, children belonging to minority religions, such as Judaism, Buddhism and the Latter Day Saint movement also study religious education in their various denominations. At many schools, secular classes in Ethics can be attended alternatively.

====Finland====
In Finland religious education is mandatory subject both in comprehensive schools (7–16 years) and in senior/upper secondary schools (16–18/19 years). Most of Finnish students study Evangelical Lutheran religious education. A student can receive religious education according to his or her own religion if the denomination is registered in Finland. Since religious education is a compulsory subject, pupils who do not belong to any religious group are taught ethics. Also some non-Lutheran pupils participate in the Evangelical Lutheran religious education.

====France====
In France, the state recognizes no religion and does not fund religious education. However, the state subsidizes private teaching establishments, including religious ones, under strict conditions of not forcing religion courses on students and not discriminating against students according to religion. An exception is the area of Alsace–Moselle where, for historical reasons (it was ruled by Germany when this system was instituted in the rest of France) under a specific local law, the state offers publicly-sponsored catechesis or instruction in some religions (Catholic, Protestant, Jewish) mostly in accord with the German model.

====Germany====
Historically, the various confessions in Germany have contributed to primary and secondary education and do so still. Education in Germany still embodies the legacy of the Prussian education system introduced by Frederick the Great in 1763. The curricula of the various states of Germany since then have included not only basic technical skills but also music (singing) and religious (Christian) education in close cooperation with the churches. This has led to the churches being assigned a specific status as legal entity of public law, &quot;Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts&quot; in Germany, which is a legacy of a 1919 Weimar compromise still in force today.

Most of the federal states of Germany, which has a long history of almost even division between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, have an arrangement whereby the religious bodies oversee the training of mainline Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious education teachers.

In one of the federal states this includes Orthodox Christian teachers as well. In Berlin, Bremen (see Bremen clause) and Brandenburg, religious education is not mandatory. E.g. in Bremen, state-authorized &quot;Bible studies&quot; were offered which were not supervised by a specific confession.

The training is supposed to be conducted according to modern standards of the humanities, and by teachers trained at mostly state-run colleges and universities. Those teachers teach religion in public schools, are paid by the state and are bound to the German constitution, as well as answerable to the churches for the content of their teaching. Children who are part of no mainstream religion (this applies e.g. to members of the New Apostolic Church) still have to take part in the classes of one of the confessions or, if they want to opt out, attend classes in Ethics or Philosophy instead. The Humanistischer Verband Deutschlands, an atheist and agnostic association, has adopted to the legal setup of the churches and is now allowed to offer such classes. From the age of 14, children may decide on their own if they want to attend religion classes and, if they do, which of those they are willing to attend. For younger children it is the decision of their parents. The state also subsidizes religious and Waldorf education schools by paying up to 90% of their expenses. These schools have to follow the same curricula as public schools of their federal state, though.

The introduction of Islamic religious education in Germany has faced various burdens and thresholds, but it is being introduced currently. While there are around three million Muslims, mostly of Turkish origin, now in the country (see Islam in Germany), not many of them are members of a legal entity with which the states could arrange such matters (unlike the Christian churches&#x27; representatives and the humanists). In 2013, for the first time in German history, the state of Hessen acknowledged a Muslim community, the reform-oriented Ahmadiyya, as &quot;Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts&quot; for all of Germany, which has been deemed a historical milestone. Ahmadiyya applied for the status just to be able to offer religious education in state schools, but is allowed now to maintain its own cemeteries and have its members&#x27; fees collected by the state&#x27;s church tax system.

====Greece====
In Greece, students at public primary and secondary schools (typically ages 6–17) learn the basics of the Greek Orthodox faith using the official curriculum. In accordance to EU&#x27;s religious freedom rules, their parents can opt them out of the religious classes by requesting it in paper without any additional justification. Students above the age of 18 can opt out by themselves. The students that opt-out attend alternative (non-religious) courses.

Universities (which are mostly public) don&#x27;t have any religious content unless it&#x27;s related to the studies.

====Italy====
In Italy, Catholic religious education is a curricula subject for students attending primary and secondary school (ages 6–19), though students can opt out of religious classes and attend alternative courses instead. Alternatively, if religious class takes place in the first or last hour, non-attending students can enter late to school or go out early. It consists of an optional hour a week for any primary and secondary school curriculum.

Data shows that the percentage of students who choose to attend religious class is in steady decline. In 2020, the percentage was 86%.

Religious education was first introduced as a mandatory activity in Italy during the fascist regime, following the 1929 Lateran Treaty, but in 1984 it became optional.

The law n. 186 of 2003 instituted the possibility of a national public recruiting for the religion professors to be enrolled within the Italian primary and secondary schools. The teachers become public servants waged directly by the Minister of Public Education and not removable from their working place. A specific norm enforced the right for enrolled religion professors to be destinated to different teaching matters, compatible with their academic degrees, if they were denied of the needy diocesan license or by effect of a personal request for a job transfer. To be admitted to the public recruiting selection the teachers need a specific teaching license released by their diocesan bishop. In 2004 it was held the first national and public recruiting selection of this type. Another has been forecasted until December 2021, after an agreement signed by Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti and the Italian Minister of Public Education Lucia Azzolina.

On February 13, 2019, the Italian minister Marco Bussetti and the Cardinal Giuseppe Versaldi, Prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education, signed an agreement for mutual recognition of academic qualifications issued in the universities of Holy See and Italy. The agreement increased significantly the number of degree titles recognized in the Italian public schools.

Religious education in Italian public schools is controversial. For some, studying Catholic religion is important to understand Italy&#x27;s historic, cultural and artistic heritage, while for others it is considered in contrast with the constitutional principles of secularity and religious freedom and also not appropriate for an increasingly diverse society. Some believe that religious education should be of exclusive competence of families and churches, therefore are opposed to religious education in public schools. However, the study of religion is always an optional choice in the public primary and secondary schools. The history of religions is taught within the scholastic curriculum of history, while some religious aspects are also integrated within the philosophy education of the Italian lyceums.

====Latvia====
In Latvia, since 2004 parents of the primary school students (grades 1 to 3) can choose Christian classes or the ethics. Christian classes are interdenominational (based on common Lutheran, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Baptist, Old Believer grounds).

====Netherlands====

In the Netherlands, a distinction is made between public and special schools. Special schools teach on the basis of religion, philosophy of life or a vision of education. Public school lessons are not based on religion or belief. Public primary schools are most strongly represented in 2019 (31.6%), followed by Roman Catholic schools (30.5%), Protestant Christian primary schools (29.6%) and by primary schools with a denomination in the category &#x27;other special&#x27; (8.3%). The relationship between schools with different denominations has remained stable in recent years. The government pays for both types of education. For this, schools must meet conditions. For example, education must be of sufficient quality. There are also requirements, for example, for the minimum number of pupils, the competence of teachers and the number of hours of education.

====Poland====

In Poland, religious education is optional in state schools. Parents decide whether children should attend religion classes or ethics classes or none of them. When a student reaches the age of 18, only then it becomes their formal autonomous decision to choose either subject or neither of them. Since 2007, grades from religion (or ethics) classes are counted towards the grade point average.

====Romania====

Religious education is optional in Romanian state schools. Parents can freely choose which religion their children will study, but a majority of religious classes focus on the Romanian Orthodox faith, which is the majority religion in the country.

====Turkey====
Institutional education in general, and religious education in particular, is centralized in Turkey. This approach began with the Unity of Education Law, which was first drafted in 1924 and preserved in subsequent legal reforms and constitutional changes. Due to the secular revolution, previous practices of the Ottoman education system were abandoned. The newer Unity of Education Law was interpreted as totally excluding religious instruction from public schools. The newly established Republic of Turkey aimed to be secular and more western with the rule of Atatürk. In 1923, changes such as the acceptance of the Latin alphabet, which is taught to pupils in the national schools, and the Gregorian calendar took place in the new established country. With the closure of Madrasas, which were provided for the society to have religious knowledge and education, classes of religion were also abolished from the schools. Religious education such as Quran courses or other religious activities had to be controlled by the government and separated from regular education.

The situation changed in 1946 when the one-party period came to an end. The faculty of Divinity was introduced in 1949 at Ankara University to educate, raise and train Imams, carry out scientific research about religion, mostly Islam. In 1956, as a result of multiparty democracy, a new government led by the former Democratic Party was established. This government introduced a religion course into secondary schools. With the Democrat Party, religion started to show up as a lecture in the schools with the name of ‘The culture of religion and Knowledge of Ethics’ but parents had to give their permission. Furthermore, Imam Hatip schools were established in some cities of Turkey with a limited number of students. In the following years, until the 1980 coup, the number of Imam Hatip Schools and religious education increased in Turkey. After the military coup in 1980, religious education in school was transformed and became a compulsory part of the curriculum, with the &quot;Culture of Religion and Knowledge of Ethics&quot; course. The content of religious education was prepared by the state, which ensured that children were first exposed to accepted interpretations of Islam before being exposed to other religious teachings.

In the late 1990s, the right of students who are graduated from Imam Hatip schools was limited with the education reform bill. Moreover, the middle school Imam Hatip schools converted to regular high schools for students to continue their higher education with other fields rather than Theology or Dignity faculties as their wish. Besides, in the beginning of 2000&#x27;s a new law led to a decrease in the number of Quran courses because the law introduce for the students to attend Quran courses after they finished their eight year of education rather than five.

====United Kingdom====
Schools approach the education of faith and religious matters in divergent manners across the four countries that constitute the United Kingdom (UK). For instance, presently schools in England and Northern Ireland respectively must teach a subject called Religious Education (RE), schools in Scotland must teach Religious and Moral Education (RME) and schools in Wales must teach Religion, Values and Ethics (RVE). Despite the matching designation of the subject in England and Northern Ireland (and the similar naming of the subjects more generally across the UK), the subjects have distinct subject matter, which is determined differently.

To expand, in England, RE occupies an unusual position in the curriculum; it is part of the Basic Curriculum and not the National Curriculum. Until the introduction of the National Curriculum, RE was the only compulsory subject in state schools. The most recent and relevant legislation on RE in England is the &quot;Education Reform Act 1988&quot;. This Act states that each Local Authority in England must create a locally agreed syllabus for RE lessons, for any maintained school in their area without a religious character. Examples of maintained school include community schools, foundation schools, voluntary aided schools and voluntary controlled schools. Local Authorities in England must do this through organising a Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education, in which representatives of local religious faith communities, teachers and the local authority itself participate, to determine the subject aims, approach and matter which will be taught in the schools of the Local Authority. Foundation schools, voluntary aided schools and voluntary controlled schools may have a religious character and/or ethos and this may affect the way which RE is taught in their settings. For instance, in foundation and voluntary controlled schools with a religious character, RE must be taught in accordance with the locally agreed syllabus, unless parents request RE in accordance with the trust deed of the school; in voluntary aided schools, RE must be taught in accordance with the trust deed. 

As of 2024, the majority of schools in England are academies. The &quot;Academies Act 2010&quot; introduced academies in England; these are funded by the state but exist outside Local Authority control. While academy leaders may choose to follow the locally agreed curriculum for their area, there is no legal condition for them to do so and they may produce their own, provided that it meets the requirements of a locally agreed syllabus, given in section 375(3) of the &quot;Education Act 1996&quot; and paragraph 5 of Schedule 19 of the &quot;School Standards and Framework Act 1998&quot;. These provisions include that any locally agreed syllabus ‘shall reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are in the main Christian whilst taking account of the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain&#x27;. State school religious education is non-proselytising and covers a variety of faiths, although the legislation requires it to include more Christian content than other faiths. The &quot;Education Reform Act&quot; &quot;1988&quot; also states that the parents of any pupil attending a maintained school may request that their child does not attend religious worship, attending or receiving any form of RE either wholly or partly, and that this request should be granted and the pupil excused until the request is withdrawn.

In Northern Ireland, RE is taught according to a core curriculum, which was developed by church groups and the Council for Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA). The subject includes the study of Christianity, morality and the main religions of the world. In Key Stage 4, pupils should examine the perspectives of different church groups.  As in England, parents have the right to withdraw their children from RE lessons.

In Scotland, RME differs in non-denominational schools and Roman Catholic schools. In non-denominational schools, the subject matter includes the study of Christianity, the major world religions, and non-religious beliefs. In Roman Catholic schools, the subject includes the study of Catholic Christianity and the major world religions. As in England and Northern Ireland, parents have the right to withdraw their children from RME lessons. The Church of Scotland does not have schools, although it does often have a presence in Scottish non-denominational institutions.

In Wales, RVE includes the study of Christianity and the other major religions of the world. The subject must also be taught in a way that reflects that a range of philosophical or non-religious beliefs exist in Wales. The subject should always be taught objectively and critically and RE teachers should adopt an unbiased approach to the subject that does not encourage a religious or non-religious point of view. Unlike England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, parents are not permitted to withdraw their children from RVE lessons.

In 2010, academics noted that RE had become overburdened with expectations in the UK, including acquiring and developing knowledge and understanding of Christianity and the other principal religions, developing the ability to make reasoned and informed judgements about religious and moral issues, enhancing pupils&#x27; spiritual, moral, cultural and social development, developing positive attitudes towards others.

===North America===
====Canada====
In Canada, religious education has varying status. On the one hand, publicly funded and organized separate schools for Roman Catholics and Protestants are mandated in some provinces and in some circumstances by various sections of the Constitution Act, 1867. On the other hand, with a growing level of multiculturalism, particularly in Ontario, debate has emerged as to whether publicly funded religious education for one group is permissible. For example, Newfoundland withdrew funding for Protestant and Roman Catholic schools in 1995, after a constitutional amendment. Quebec abolished religious education funded by the state through the &quot;Education Act, 1998&quot;, which took effect on July 1 of that same year, again after a constitutional amendment. Quebec re-organized the schools along linguistic rather than religious lines. In Ontario, however, the move to abolish funding has been strongly resisted. In the 2007 provincial election, the topic of funding for faith-based schools that were not Catholic became a major topic. The provincial conservative party was defeated due, in part, to their support of the idea.

====United States====
In the United States, religious education is often provided voluntarily through supplementary &quot;Sunday school&quot;, &quot;Hebrew school&quot;, or catechism classes, taught to children at their families&#x27; places of worship, either in conjunction with worship services or some other time during the week, after weekday school classes. Some families believe supplementary religious education is inadequate, and send their children to private religious schools, called parochial schools when Catholic, day schools or yeshivas when Jewish. Many faiths also offer private college and graduate-level religious schools or seminaries, some of which are accredited as colleges.

In public schools, U.S. law allows for religious education under released time during school hours; LifeWise Academy and Child Evangelism Fellowship are examples of voluntary Christian programs that utilize this. Additionally, under U.S. law, religious education in public schools is permittable if it is done from a neutral, academic perspective.

===South Asia===
====India====

In India, there are a number of private schools run by religious institutions, especially for Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains and Buddhists. During the era of British rule, Christian private schools were quite prominent and widely attended by both UK (British) and Indian students. Many of the schools established during this era, especially in areas with a heavy Christian population, are still in existence today. In addition to regular formal education, a number of religious institutions have instituted regular informal religious/spiritual education programs for children and adults.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, Muslim students must take Islamic studies from primary to higher education. The subject is optional for non-Muslim students, who can choose the subject of ethics instead. The emphasis on religious studies in Pakistan&#x27;s education system began when the nation was established in 1947. As a result, students in both public and private schools in Pakistan have the opportunity to learn subjects such as arts, science, English, and mathematics. However, in contrast, students in seminaries do not engage in any of these subjects.

===Southeast Asia===
In Thailand, Burma and other majority Buddhist societies, Buddhist teachings and social decorum are sometimes taught in public school. Young men are expected to live as monks for several months at one time in their lives during which they can receive religious education.

<text>The Cactus Al/Bum (also known as The Cactus Cee/D and The Cactus Cas/Ette depending on release format) is the debut album by hip hop trio 3rd Bass, released on Def Jam Recordings on November 14, 1989. The album received positive reviews from the hip hop press and is also notable for featuring the recording debut of rapper Zev Love X of KMD, later known as MF Doom, on &quot;The Gas Face&quot;. It was certified gold by the RIAA on April 24, 1990.

&quot;The Cactus Album&quot; peaked at No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Hip Hop/R&amp;B Albums chart and at No. 55 on the Billboard 200 chart. In 1998, the album was selected as one of &quot;The Source&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Rap Albums&quot;. A decade later, Rhapsody included &quot;The Cactus Album&quot; in its list of &quot;The 10 Best Albums By White Rappers&quot;.

== Background ==
Most of the music was produced by Sam Sever, alongside members MC Serch and Pete Nice, except for the Prince Paul-produced tracks &quot;The Gas Face&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn-Queens,&quot; and &quot;Steppin&#x27; to the A.M.&quot; and &quot;Oval Office&quot; by the Bomb Squad.
The album generally features songs that are either lyrical showcases or are about women, such as the hidden sexual meaning of &quot;Oval Office&quot;. The song &quot;Sons of 3rd Bass&quot; can be viewed as a diss to the Beastie Boys – who had recently severed ties with 3rd Bass&#x27; record label, Def Jam – in that it references them in many lines, such as one line uttered by MC Serch in the first verse.

The song &quot;Wordz of Wisdom&quot; was recorded under the name Three the Hard Way. The group&#x27;s name was changed after they signed to Def Jam; however, the recording still made its way onto the album.

The group had a minor hit with the single &quot;The Gas Face&quot;. The accompanying music video, which featured a bevy of humorous cameo appearances that included Gilbert Gottfried, Flavor Flav, Salt-n-Pepa, and Erick Sermon, garnered MTV airplay. The song also features Daniel Dumile in his recording debut. At the time, he was recording under the alias Zev Love X and was a member of the rap trio KMD, but he would later come to be known as MF Doom. KMD were mentioned several times on the album, and they appeared in the music videos for &quot;The Gas Face&quot; and &quot;Steppin&#x27; to the A.M.&quot;

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Orange County Register&quot; concluded that &quot;credit has to go to 3rd Bass&#x27; all-star lineup of producers—Prince Paul (Stetsasonic), Hank Shocklee, Eric Sadler, Sam Sever—who makes sure the twosome&#x27;s rhymes are blade sharp (if repetitive in parts) and the beats are brick heavy.&quot;

== Track listing ==

=== Charting singles ===
== The Cactus Vidie/Yo ==

The Cactus Vidie/Yo is a collection of 3rd Bass music videos, released in 1991. The video, which was distributed by Columbia Music Video, contained music videos of the album&#x27;s singles as well as short skits featuring Gilbert Gottfried that appeared between the selections. The &quot;Wordz of Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Triple Stage Darkness&quot; videos were not full-length and only contained the first couple verses of the song. The video was only released on VHS.

The videos featured are as follows:

# Steppin&#x27; to the A.M.

<text>Nebraska is the sixth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, released on September 30, 1982, by Columbia Records. Springsteen recorded the songs as solo demos using a four-track recorder in the bedroom of his home in Colts Neck, New Jersey, intending to rerecord them with the E Street Band, but decided to release them as they were after full-band renditions were deemed unsatisfactory. Seventeen songs appeared on the tape, ten of which appeared on &quot;Nebraska&quot;, while others appeared in full-band renditions on the follow-up album &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; (1984) and as B-sides.

Living isolated in Colts Neck, Springsteen was influenced by American literature, films, and folk music when writing the &quot;Nebraska&quot; songs. The short stories of Flannery O&#x27;Connor particularly inspired him to write about his own childhood memories. Featuring a stark, lo-fi sound, the tracks tell the stories of ordinary, blue-collar individuals who try to succeed in life but fail at every turn, going in search of deliverance that never comes. Some are told through the eyes of outlaws and criminals, such as the killer Charles Starkweather on the title track. The album&#x27;s cover artwork, a 1975 photograph taken by David Michael Kennedy, depicts a black-top road under a cloudy sky through the windshield of a car.

&quot;Nebraska&quot; stylistically stood apart from other releases in the year. Commercially, it sold well, peaking at number three in the U.S. It was accompanied by two European singles—&quot;Atlantic City&quot; and &quot;Open All Night&quot;; the former was supported by Springsteen&#x27;s first music video. Springsteen did not promote the record, believing listeners should experience it for themselves. On release, critics praised the album as brave and artistically daring and Springsteen&#x27;s most personal record up to that point. Negative reviews felt the songs stylistically merged together and its dark themes would appeal to fans only. The album appeared on several year-end lists.

Retrospective reviewers call &quot;Nebraska&quot; a masterpiece and one of Springsteen&#x27;s finest works, being applauded as a timeless record that has lost none of its power since its release. It has appeared on lists of the greatest albums of all time. &quot;Nebraska&quot; proved influential in home recording, being recognized as one of the first DIY records released by a major artist and influencing the indie rock and underground music scenes. Numerous artists have paid tribute to the album and have cited its impact on their music. It has also inspired films and literature; a feature film based on the album&#x27;s making will star Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen.

==Background and development==

Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;The River&quot; was released in October 1980. The album and supporting tour brought Springsteen and the E Street Band their largest amount of commercial success yet. Nevertheless, his newfound attention led him to look inward about his role as an entertainer. Springsteen later explained that &quot;The River&quot; success led to him dealing with &quot;very conflicted feelings about being so separate from the people that I&#x27;d grown up around and that I wrote about&quot;. At the end of the tour, he retreated to his newly-rented ranch in Colts Neck, New Jersey, in September 1981.

Living isolated in Colts Neck, Springsteen engrossed himself in American history, reading books and watching films in search of stories to use for songwriting. Books he read included Joe Klein&#x27;s &quot;Woody Guthrie: A Life&quot; (1980), Howard Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; (1980), Allan Nevins and Henry Steele Commager&#x27;s &quot;A Pocket History of the United States&quot;, and Ron Kovic&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1976), while films he watched included John Ford&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940), Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973), John Huston&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Wise Blood&quot; (1979), and Ulu Grosbard&#x27;s &quot;True Confessions&quot; (1981). Springsteen also began reflecting on his own childhood and studied the &quot;romans noirs&quot; of James M. Cain and Jim Thompson, the Gothic short stories of Flannery O&#x27;Connor, and the music of the singer-songwriters Guthrie, Bob Dylan, and Hank Williams. &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; Bill See says that from these sources, Springsteen retrieved &quot;a humanity and a curiosity about why certain people lose connection with themselves, their families, their community, [and] their government&quot;.
O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s writings were particularly influential on Springsteen. The author and critic Dave Marsh said that Springsteen became impressed by the &quot;minute-precision&quot; of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s prose and believed that he had felt that his songwriting had been too vague, too &quot;dreamlike&quot;, instead wanting to write songs that were more detailed and concrete, away from the &quot;clash and babble of metaphor&quot; found occasionally on his previous albums. O&#x27;Connor wrote some of her stories from a child&#x27;s perspective, which inspired Springsteen to write songs in a similar manner. Springsteen himself stated that the songs from the period were more &quot;connected&quot; to his childhood than ever before. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Catholicism was also an influence. Springsteen stated in his 2003 book &quot;Songs&quot;: &quot;Her stories reminded me of the unknowability of God and contained a dark spirituality that resonated with my own feelings at the time.&quot; Songs written during the period featured stories ranging from Springsteen&#x27;s childhood to ones about criminals and violence, as well as one about a Vietnam veteran returning home from the war to an unenthusiastic response.

==Recording==
===Colts Neck===
Annoyed at how long it took him to record in the studio, Springsteen decided to record the new songs as solo demos, intending to rerecord them with the E Street Band – Roy Bittan (piano), Clarence Clemons (saxophone), Danny Federici (organ), Garry Tallent (bass), Steven Van Zandt (guitar), and Max Weinberg (drums) – at a later date. He later told the author Warren Zanes: &quot;The recordings were just meant to get us a jump start on work in the studio with the band. I&#x27;d always spent a lot of time writing in the studio. I was trying to be more efficient, I guess. Certainly trying to spend a little less money.&quot;
Springsteen tasked his guitar technician, Mike Batlan, with buying a simple tape recorder to work out some demos and tinker with arrangements. Batlan picked up a four-track TEAC 144 Portastudio recorder, a then-relatively new device that allowed musicians to perform a basic track first before adding additional parts on the remaining tracks. Springsteen believed these overdubbed instruments would help the band understand how the final track should sound. He and Batlan set the recorder up in the bedroom of his Colts Neck home. They connected the machine to two Shure SM57 microphones on stands. Springsteen played a Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar, overdubbing harmonica, percussion, mandolin, and glockenspiel. The demos were recorded between December 17, 1981, and January 3, 1982. Most of the basic tracks (vocals and acoustic guitar) were finished in four to six takes.

Springsteen and Batlan mixed the sound by plugging the recorder into an Echoplex, a tape delay effects machine, and using an old water-logged Panasonic boombox as a mix-down deck to bring the final mix onto a cassette tape. In his 2003 book &quot;Songs&quot;, Springsteen stated he recorded this way because he &quot;found the atmosphere in the studio to be sterile and isolating&quot;. Fifteen songs appeared on the initial cassette tape: &quot;Bye Bye Johnny&quot;, &quot;Starkweather&quot;/&quot;Nebraska&quot;, &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot;, &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Johnny 99&quot;, &quot;Downbound Train&quot;, &quot;The Losin&#x27; Kind&quot;, &quot;State Trooper&quot;, &quot;Used Cars&quot;, &quot;Wanda (Open All Night)&quot;, &quot;Child Bride&quot;, &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;, &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot;, and &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;.

Following mixing, Springsteen sent the tape to his manager-producer Jon Landau with two pages of handwritten notes about arrangements and mixes. According to the biographer Peter Ames Carlin, Landau was &quot;impressed by the power of the songs&#x27; minimalist narratives&quot; and the &quot;yelping desperation in the performances&quot;. In the subsequent months, Springsteen recorded two more songs at Colts Neck using the same recording methods: &quot;The Big Payback&quot;, between March and April, and &quot;My Father&#x27;s House&quot;, on May 25.

===Attempted rerecordings===

In April 1982, Springsteen and the E Street Band rehearsed the demos at Bittan&#x27;s house before regrouping at the Power Station in New York City to rerecord them for release on the next album. The band spent two weeks attempting full-band arrangements of the Colts Neck tracks but Springsteen and his co-producers—Landau, Van Zandt, and Chuck Plotkin—were dissatisfied with the results. Springsteen, in particular, felt many of the full-band versions failed to capture the spirit of the demos, while Plotkin blamed the studio&#x27;s &quot;tendency to conventionalize sounds&quot;. Other songs from the tape, including &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Downbound Train&quot;, &quot;Child Bride&quot; (rewritten as &quot;Working on the Highway&quot;), and &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; proved successful in full-band arrangements. Continuing into May, the band also recorded newly-written songs, including &quot;Glory Days&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Goin&#x27; Down&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, &quot;Wages of Sin&quot;, and &quot;Johnny Bye-Bye&quot;.

Despite the band&#x27;s productivity and excitement about the recorded material, Springsteen remained focused on the rest of the Colts Neck songs. Attached to the cassette&#x27;s &quot;authentic&quot; sound, he carried it with him in his jeans pocket, unsure of what to do with the material. Throughout June, Springsteen and his co-producers began mixing and sequencing the acoustic and electric material as separate albums. At some point, a decision was made to release the acoustic demos as is. Springsteen briefly considered releasing a double album of acoustic and electric songs before deciding to release the acoustic ones on their own to give them &quot;greater stature&quot;. Van Zandt told Springsteen: &quot;The fact that you didn&#x27;t intend to release it makes it the most intimate record you&#x27;ll ever do. This is an absolutely legitimate piece of art.&quot; The acoustic album, titled &quot;Nebraska&quot;, became Springsteen&#x27;s first and only album he made without knowing he was making a record.

Springsteen&#x27;s fans have long speculated whether the full-band recordings of the &quot;Nebraska&quot; material, nicknamed &quot;Electric Nebraska&quot;, will ever surface. Having never appeared on bootlegs, it is among the most sought after of Springsteen&#x27;s unreleased material. In a 1984 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Springsteen believed an official release was unlikely, saying: &quot;A lot of [&quot;Nebraska&quot;] content was in its style, in the treatment of it. It needed that really kinda austere, echoey sound, just one guitar—one guy telling his story.&quot; Decades later in 2006, Landau said that the electric release is unlikely because &quot;the right version came out&quot;. Nevertheless, in a 2010 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Weinberg praised the full-band renditions as &quot;killing&quot; and &quot;very hard-edged&quot;.

=== Mastering ===
Springsteen tasked the engineer Toby Scott with mastering the recordings, which proved problematic due to how he and Batlan recorded them. According to &quot;Classic Rock Review&quot;, the demos were not recorded at optimal volume or with optimal noise reduction, meaning it was difficult to transfer the recordings to vinyl. For weeks, Plotkin and Scott attempted to transfer the recordings to the mixing console in the Power Station with no success. Attempts at remixing Springsteen and Batlan&#x27;s original mixes also failed. Plotkin and Scott eventually took the tape to different mastering facilities, with failed attempts by the mastering engineers Bob Ludwig, Steve Marcussen, and Greg Calbi. After two months, the final master was made at New York City&#x27;s Atlantic Studios by Dennis King, who was able to resolve the tape&#x27;s low recording volume with noise reduction techniques. In a 2007 interview, Scott explained: &quot;[W]e ended up having Bob Ludwig use his EQ and his mastering facility, but with Dennis [King&#x27;s] mastering parameters. And that&#x27;s the master we ended up using.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Nebraska&quot; represented a major stylistic departure for Springsteen, although several songs from &quot;The River&quot; foreshadowed its direction, including &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, and &quot;Wreck On the Highway&quot;. Featuring only Springsteen, &quot;Nebraska&quot; is a minimalist folk record, with folk rock, heartland rock, lo-fi, and country influences. Commentators have described its music and lyrics as stark, bleak, haunting, somber, depressing, and brutal. AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann called the recordings themselves &quot;unpolished&quot; and sounding unfinished. &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; Bill See noted the numerous &quot;imperfections&quot; in the mix, including &quot;the creaking of a chair, the &quot;P&#x27;s&quot; that pop, the over-modulated harmonicas and Jimmy Rogers-like howls that pin the VU meters&quot;. Joe Pelone of punknews.org argues that the album&#x27;s lo-fi nature gives the songs a &quot;hazy atmosphere&quot; that &quot;forces listeners to imagine more about what&#x27;s going on, creating sounds that aren&#x27;t there&quot;. Springsteen explained: &quot;My &quot;Nebraska&quot; songs were the opposite of the rock music I&#x27;d been writing. These new songs were narrative, restrained, linear, and musically minimal. Yet their depiction of characters out on the edge contextualized them as rock and roll.&quot;

The songs on &quot;Nebraska&quot; tell the stories of ordinary, blue-collar individuals who try to succeed in life but fail at every turn. Caught in the midst of existential crises, they realize that their lives are devoid of meaning and search for a deliverance that never comes. Their desperation and alienation pushes them to commit unspeakable acts. See noted the subservient role the working class characters have accepted through the use of the words &quot;sir&quot; and &quot;son&quot;. In their analyses of the album, the writers Ryan Sheeler and David McLaughlin state that the songs dissect the vulnerability of the American Dream, offering a harsh look on life through the eyes of outlaws, poor folk, and estranged families, and what happens when the pillars of life – work, love, family and friends – crumble and there is nowhere left to run. Several commentators, including the critic Greil Marcus, interpreted the album&#x27;s stories and themes as reflections of America during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, although Steven Hyden states that the songs were not &quot;explicitly&quot; or &quot;implicitly&quot; political, but were interpreted as such due to the timing of the album&#x27;s release. In his 1985 book on Springsteen, Robert Hilburn said the &quot;Nebraska&quot; songs were simply &quot;an extension of the social concerns he began expressing on the River Tour&quot;.

Stories told through the eyes of criminals include &quot;Nebraska&quot; and &quot;Johnny 99&quot;, as well as through Springsteen&#x27;s own childhood memories on &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot;, &quot;Used Cars&quot;, and &quot;My Father&#x27;s House&quot;. Several songs are driven by automobiles. Compared to Springsteen&#x27;s previous records, where the car represented escape (&quot;Born to Run&quot;) and a place where stories unfolded (&quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; and portions of &quot;The River&quot;), cars on &quot;Nebraska&quot; represent a chamber that keeps its characters isolated, or one they travel in while searching for some type of connection as the world passes them by.

===Side one===

The opening track, &quot;Nebraska&quot;, tells the story of the killer Charles Starkweather, who murdered ten people from 1957 to 1958 between Nebraska and Wyoming while traveling with his girlfriend Caril Ann Fugate. After his capture, Starkweather is sentenced to death by electric chair but remains unrepentant, blaming his actions on the &quot;meanness&quot; of the world. Springsteen wrote the song after watching &quot;Badlands&quot;, a film about the couple, and reading the Ninette Beaver book &quot;Caril&quot; (1974). The song is sung from a first-person perspective; Springsteen said in 2005 that &quot;everyone knows what it is like to be condemned&quot;. The song&#x27;s music was described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Steve Pond as &quot;gentle&quot; and &quot;soothing&quot;. 

&quot;Atlantic City&quot; follows mob wars in the titular city. At the time it was written, Atlantic City was controlled by corruption and had turned to gambling in hopes of revitalizing the city. In the song, a young man struggles to make an honest living, forcing him and his girlfriend to relocate to the city so he can join the mob. Springsteen mentions &quot;the Chicken Man from Philly&quot;, which referred to the mafia boss Philip Testa, who was murdered in 1981. Margotin and Guesdon note the song&#x27;s &quot;dense atmosphere and the performance&#x27;s feeling or urgency&quot;.

&quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot; evokes Springsteen&#x27;s childhood memories, remembering a large mansion on top of a hill that piqued his curiosity, and car rides with his father. Its title was taken from a Hank Williams song of the same name. Like other songs on the album, the musical arrangement is minimal, with guitar and harmonica. Margotin and Guesdon note &quot;a spellbinding, hypnotic atmosphere&quot; that is &quot;filled with emotion and restraint&quot;. 

In &quot;Johnny 99&quot;, the narrator is laid off from his job at the Ford assembly plant in Mahwah, New Jersey, and takes out his frustration by murdering a hotel clerk; he is captured and subsequently sentenced to 99 years in prison and begs for the death penalty. Unlike the murderer in &quot;Nebraska&quot;, the perpetrator on &quot;Johnny 99&quot; shows remorse for his action, saying he is &quot;better off dead&quot; due to his large debts and a house being foreclosed. Musically, it features a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll/rockabilly rhythm with echoed vocals and an ambient atmosphere. AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann describes Springsteen&#x27;s performance as &quot;raucous&quot;, one that starts with &quot;lonely falsetto wails&quot; and ends with &quot;exuberant falsetto shouts&quot;.

&quot;Highway Patrolman&quot; &quot;juxtaposes the duty to carry out the law with the blood ties of family loyalty&quot;. It tells the story of an honest police officer named Joe Roberts who is given a choice of turning his own brother in for committing a crime or letting him go, ultimately going with the latter. Springsteen argues in the song&#x27;s chorus, &quot;Man turns his back on his family/Well, he just ain&#x27;t no good.&quot; 

&quot;State Trooper&quot; is a lo-fi folk song led solely by vocals and guitar. &quot;Classic Rock Review&quot; describes the guitar line as emulating &quot;the recurring sound of the road&quot;. Musically, the track was directly influenced by &quot;Frankie Teardrop&quot; by the synth-punk band Suicide. Lyrically, the song is told from the point-of-view of a car thief; he does not have a license or registration and becomes increasingly paranoid the farther he travels on a deserted highway. The verses end with the driver&#x27;s plea to a state trooper—either real or imaginary—not to stop him as he drives through the night.

===Side two===

&quot;Used Cars&quot; uses Springsteen&#x27;s childhood to describe his own experiences with his father and differences in social classes growing up. Set to gentle music, the narrator watches his father purchase a used car as the family cannot afford a new one. The father, worn from years of manual labor and ashamed of his poor income, is unable to share his feelings with his son. The family shows off their &quot;brand new used car&quot; to the neighbors, after which the narrator clings to the hope that he can escape from this reality and win the lottery, vowing he is &quot;never gonna ride in no used car again&quot;.

&quot;Open All Night&quot; has a more light-hearted mood compared to the rest of the album, being an up-tempo rock song with a Chuck Berry-style melody and rhythm. The singer wants to be delivered from nowhere, but requests that rock and roll music accompany his long journey driving down the New Jersey Turnpike. The song was inspired by an unnamed short story by the novelist William Price Fox. 

&quot;My Father&#x27;s House&quot; is the final song on the album relating to Springsteen&#x27;s childhood. It returns to a sadder mood, wherein the narrator has a dream in which, as a child, he is saved by his father from dark forces in a forest. Upon waking up, he decides to reconcile with his estranged father. When the narrator arrives at his father&#x27;s house, the narrator finds he no longer lives there, with his dreams of making peace with his father crushed. 

The album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, Springsteen tells four short stories across four verses: a man hopes to revive a dead dog on the side of a highway by poking it; a woman waits at the end of a road for a man who never comes; a child is born and a man dies; and a groom waits for bride who stood him up. The verses are unified by the singer&#x27;s humorous outlook that individuals always find &quot;some reason to believe&quot;. The author Rob Kirkpatrick argues that the song&#x27;s point is that &quot;people endure, that they struggle against all evidence to the contrary, because it&#x27;s the only thing that they can do—or else they end up dead, spiritually or literally&quot;. According to the writer Irwin Streight, the song &quot;seeks to resolve the litanies of meanness, desperation, hopelessness, and longing recounted in the preceding stories, and to resolve them in a decidedly Catholic fashion&quot;. Margotin and Guesdon describe the musical performance as emitting &quot;sorrow and fatalism&quot;.

==Artwork and packaging==
The cover artwork of &quot;Nebraska&quot; is a black-and-white photograph of a black-top road under a cloudy sky taken through the windshield of a car. The photograph was originally taken by the landscape photographer David Michael Kennedy during the winter of 1975. Springsteen did not want himself on the cover, instead envisioning a landscape. Kennedy was hired by the art director Andrea Klein after showing Springsteen some of Kennedy&#x27;s work. Kennedy provided various images before Springsteen selected the final one. Some commentators have agreed that the artwork matches the album&#x27;s tone and mood perfectly. The singer&#x27;s name and album title appear in bright red above and below the image, respectively, stylized in all caps. Springsteen said of the image:

The back of the sleeve contains a photograph of Springsteen in a brightly lit room taken by Kennedy in his Brewster, New York, home. Springsteen said he wanted his presence both known and unknown: &quot;The picture we used inside, it was kind of my ghost. It wasn&#x27;t quite me. It was... the earlier part of yourself that stays with you.&quot; The inside sleeve includes lyrics of the album&#x27;s ten songs. The album title was not chosen until shortly before the album&#x27;s release. Nearly half of the song titles were considered, including &quot;State Trooper&quot;, &quot;Used Cars&quot;, and &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, before Springsteen settled on &quot;Nebraska&quot; after the first song on the album and the first one he recorded.

==Release==

Columbia and its international arm CBS Records were ecstatic when Springsteen and Landau presented &quot;Nebraska&quot; to them. Columbia and CBS&#x27;s presidents, Walter Yetnikoff and Al Teller, respectively, believed the album would not sell as well as &quot;The River&quot;, but loved the music and felt it represented an artistic growth for Springsteen. Teller promised a more subdued advertising campaign compared to &quot;The River&quot; and anticipated sales of less than one million copies.

&quot;Nebraska&quot; was released on September 30, 1982. In a year dominated by British synth-pop, the album stylistically stood apart from other releases in the year by pop artists such as A Flock of Seagulls, Lionel Richie, Olivia Newton-John, and the Human League. It confused both casual and serious fans, but sold well, debuting on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart at number 29, peaking at number three. By 1989, it had sold one million copies and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, the album peaked at number two in Sweden, three in Canada, Norway, New Zealand, and the U.K., seven in the Netherlands, eight in Australia, and ten in Japan. It also reached number 18 in France and 37 in West Germany.

&quot;Nebraska&quot; was supported by two singles. The first, &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, with &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot; as the B-side, was released in Europe and Japan only in October 1982. Springsteen&#x27;s first ever music video was produced as promotion for rotation on MTV. Directed by Arnold Levine, the &quot;Atlantic City&quot; video does not feature Springsteen himself, instead featuring black-and-white documentary-style footage of the titular city shot on location. Commentators have described the video as &quot;bleak&quot; and &quot;atmospheric&quot;. &quot;Open All Night&quot; was released as the second single, again in Europe only, on November 22. Its B-side was &quot;The Big Payback&quot;, a rockabilly song with lyrics related to working life.

Springsteen himself did not promote the album; he conducted no interviews and, for the first time after an album release, did not tour. In his 2016 autobiography &quot;Born to Run&quot;, he explained that &quot;it felt too soon after &quot;The River&quot;, and &quot;Nebraska&quot; quiet stillness would take me a while longer to bring to the stage&quot;. He also stated that he wanted listeners to experience the album for themselves: &quot;I thought I could only hurt the project at that moment by trying to explain it... if I &quot;could&quot; explain it.&quot;

Following &quot;Nebraska&quot; release, Springsteen vacationed on a cross-country road trip to California, where he demoed new songs similar in style to &quot;Nebraska&quot; at his newly purchased Los Angeles home before returning to New York in April 1983 to continue recording with the E Street Band. Sessions lasted until February 1984, during which the band recorded between 70 and 90 songs. The follow-up to &quot;Nebraska&quot;, &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, was released in June 1984. A rock and roll record, it featured full-band arrangements of three songs from the original Colts Neck tape: &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Downbound Train&quot;, and &quot;Working on the Highway&quot; (reworked from &quot;Child Bride&quot;), while the electric versions of &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; and &quot;Johnny Bye-Bye&quot; were released as the B-sides of the &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot; singles, respectively. Out of the seventeen songs on the original demo tape, the crime tale &quot;The Losin&#x27; Kind&quot; is the only one that remains unreleased.

==Critical reception==
On its original release, critical reception to &quot;Nebraska&quot; was mostly positive. It was hailed by critics for its boldness and individuality, being called an unexpected, brave, and artistically daring record. Its stylistic departure from Springsteen&#x27;s previous works came as a shock to some critics. Robert Hilburn compared the change in style to when Bob Dylan went electric, and called &quot;Nebraska&quot; &quot;one of the most bold uncompromising artistic statements since John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; album in 1970&quot;.

Critics described &quot;Nebraska&quot; as Springsteen&#x27;s most personal album up to that the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; Joel Selvin declared: &quot;Never before has a major recording artist made himself so vulnerable or open.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Robert Palmer summarized: &quot;It&#x27;s been a long time since a mainstream rock star made an album that asks such tough questions and refuses to settle for easy answers – let alone an album suggesting that perhaps there are no answers.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Steve Pond praised &quot;Nebraska&quot; as a &quot;tactical masterstroke&quot;, positively comparing it to &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; (1978), and commending Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;sharp focus&quot; and &quot;insistence on painting small details so clearly and his determination to make a folk album firmly in the tradition&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; Jon Young praised Springsteen&#x27;s growth as an artist and felt he succeeded as a &quot;guitar-strumming storyteller&quot;, saying: &quot;He may have scaled down his attack, but Springsteen hasn&#x27;t diminished his ambition one bit.&quot;

Several commented on the acoustic instrumentation. In &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Mike Gardner felt that critics who believed Springsteen&#x27;s power came solely from the E Street Band would be proven wrong, saying that &quot;Springsteen&#x27;s gift for making epic aural stories out of such material is turned on its head by the simple backing&quot;. Writing for &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine, Johnny Waller enjoyed the &quot;new perspective&quot; gained from listening to the material in a back-to-basics approach. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Jay Cocks compared the sound to &quot;a Library of Congress field recording made out behind some shutdown auto plant&quot;. Cocks noticed a recycling of lyrical themes from older records, but felt they worked to Springsteen&#x27;s advantage: &quot;he can get the same sort of mythic resonance from this setting that John Ford took out of Monument Valley.&quot; Commenting on the album&#x27;s recording methods, &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; Ariel Swartley said &quot;Nebraska&quot; is &quot;the rock-and-roller&#x27;s version of joining a monastery or running away to farm: solo, acoustic, old-fashioned, homemade.&quot; 

Other critics were more negative. Some felt that, due to similar music and themes, the songs stylistically merged together. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Robert Christgau criticized the music, arguing that Springsteen lacked the vocal and melodic imagination to &quot;enrich these bitter tales of late capitalism&quot; with bare instrumentation. More negatively, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Richard Harrington said &quot;Nebraska&quot; &quot;may be the most undynamic album of 1982&quot;, panning the &quot;horrid&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; sound quality and concluding: &quot;One applauds Springsteen&#x27;s commitment, but questions its ponderous and portentous execution.&quot; &quot;Musician&quot; magazine&#x27;s Paul Nelson said the album sounded &quot;demoralizing&quot;, &quot;murderously monotonous&quot;, and &quot;deprived of spark or hope&quot;, but in the end, he &quot;found a road map that me to the right places&quot;. In &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, David Hepworth felt that due to the album&#x27;s dark tone and &quot;bleak pessimism&quot;, it would likely only be appreciated by fans. In &quot;Creem&quot;, Richard C. Walls enjoyed the album, but suspected that most listeners would find it &quot;more admirable than likable&quot;. 

In &quot;The Village Voice&quot; annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, &quot;Nebraska&quot; was voted the third best album of 1982, behind Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; and Richard and Linda Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it in their list of the year&#x27;s top 40 albums, while &quot;NME&quot; placed it at number 33 in their end-of-year list. &quot;Time&quot; included it in their list of the year&#x27;s best albums.

==Retrospective reviews==
In later decades, &quot;Nebraska&quot; has been ranked as one of Springsteen&#x27;s finest records. Critics have called the record a masterpiece, a classic, one that enjoys repeated listens, and one of the most brave albums ever released by a major artist. Margotin and Guesdon said that with &quot;Nebraska&quot;, Springsteen elevated himself amongst the best singers in American popular music. Bill See described &quot;Nebraska&quot; as &quot;high art&quot; on par with Guthrie, Steinbeck, and O&#x27;Connor. It has been called an outlier in Springsteen&#x27;s discography, being released between the &quot;stadium-rock&quot; records &quot;The River&quot; and &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; It is also cited as the album non-Springsteen fans enjoy the most.

&quot;Nebraska&quot; has been applauded for its storytelling, themes, and production. Martin Chilton and William Ruhlmann argue its unpolished nature and imperfections are a part of its charm. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Mark Richardson said the songs are &quot;very good&quot;, but &quot;their true meaning came out in the presentation&quot;. Sheeler commended Springsteen&#x27;s ability to effectively weave himself as both narrator and character in the songs, wherein &quot;the lines are blurred and each scene seems like a homespun conversation with each character&quot; as they share their experiences. &quot;Mojo&quot; Sylvie Simmons said it was &quot;that nakedness and willingness to face the darkness head-on that made &quot;Nebraska&quot; a touchstone for a whole new wave of young American bands.&quot;
Several have described &quot;Nebraska&quot; as a timeless record, having lost none of its power and its themes remaining relevant decades after its release. Zanes argued the album&#x27;s power was unveiled in the years following its initial release and listeners discovered it on their own time, being &quot;passed around like a rumor&quot;. Hyden similarly said that the album&#x27;s stories of suffering can translate to &quot;whatever era [listeners] happen to live in&quot;. &quot;The Ringer&quot; Elizabeth Nelson wrote that the stories of haunted highways and characters &quot;still haunt the American psyche&quot;, while &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; Ian Winwood said the album remains Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;most enduring&quot; record: &quot;The hard truths behind its cold stare have proved persistent to the point of immovability.&quot; 

Not all reviews have been positive. &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Williams believed that &quot;Nebraska&quot; would have been a better record with the E Street Band and &quot;a few more months in the studio&quot;. &quot;Consequence of Sound&#x27;s&quot; Harry Houser and Bryan Kitching argue that due to its dark and heart-wrenching qualities, the stories were not easy-listening and lacked the ability to be played at parties or bars.

===Rankings===
&quot;Nebraska&quot; has appeared on multiple best-of lists. In 1989, it was ranked 43rd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2003, it was ranked number 224 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 226 in a 2012 revised list, and 150 in a 2020 reboot of the list. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; placed the album at number 13 in its list of &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 57 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. The following year, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 148 in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Two years later, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included it in a list compiling the 100 best rock albums of the 1980s. In 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed it as the 28th greatest album of the 1980s. In a 2022 list compiling the 50 best albums of 1982, &quot;Spin&quot; placed &quot;Nebraska&quot; at number 17. In 2024, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine placed it at number 223 in their list of the 300 greatest albums of all time. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==

=== Later records by Springsteen ===
In the decades following its release, Springsteen has released two albums in a similar stripped-down acoustic style of &quot;Nebraska&quot;: &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; (1995) and &quot;Devils &amp; Dust&quot; (2005). With &quot;Ghost&quot;, Springsteen said that he wanted to &quot;pick up where I&#x27;d left off with &quot;Nebraska&quot;, set the stories in the mid-&#x27;90s and in the land of my current residence, California&quot;. With &quot;Devils&quot;, Springsteen felt that his acoustic demos were superior to full-band renditions. Both albums contained downbeat themes, but unlike &quot;Nebraska&quot;, featured a handful of other musicians accompanying Springsteen on many tracks. Many critics agree that the two albums failed to match the power and consistency of &quot;Nebraska&quot;. Reflecting on &quot;Nebraska&quot;, Springsteen described it as his &quot;most personal record&quot;: &quot;It felt to me, in its tone, the most what my childhood felt like.&quot; Speaking in 2023, Springsteen called it his definitive album.

=== Impact on home recording ===
&quot;Nebraska&quot; represented a breakthrough in home recording. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Al Shipley wrote that at the time of its release, the majority of musical artists, including smaller indie bands, primarily only released music that was recorded in a studio and home demos were rarely made available to the public. &quot;Nebraska&quot; has been credited as one of the first DIY records released by a major artist and subsequently sparked a DIY revolution. In the decades following its release, numerous artists began recording their own music at home. Warren McQuiston wrote in &quot;Performer&quot; magazine: &quot;The success of &quot;Nebraska&quot; strictly as a recording project was the &quot;emperor has no clothes&quot; moment. You could make a record at home, a real one that, and if done right could be good enough to be released on Colombia Records.&quot; 

&quot;Nebraska&quot; also influenced the indie rock and underground music scenes, paving the way for releases by artists such as Ween, Neutral Milk Hotel, Iron &amp; Wine, and Bon Iver. Matt Berninger, lead singer of the National, said: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just the fact that it was a magical record in terms of its scenes and characters. It was the idea that a major rock star could make something just in his bedroom. It exploded so many of my received ideas and told me that, maybe I could be a musician.&quot; &quot;Nebraska&quot; is considered an essential home record, the &quot;most celebrated&quot; lo-fi record by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; Neil McCormick, and was named the greatest home recording ever made by &quot;Paste&quot; magazine in 2012.

===Tributes===
Numerous artists have paid tribute to &quot;Nebraska&quot; since its release. Johnny Cash covered &quot;Johnny 99&quot; and &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot; for his 1983 album &quot;Johnny 99&quot;. A tribute album, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2000. Produced by Jim Sampas, it featured covers of the &quot;Nebraska&quot; songs recorded in a similar stripped-down spirit of the original recordings by artists including Cash, Hank Williams III, Los Lobos, Dar Williams, Deana Carter, Ani DiFranco, Son Volt, Ben Harper, Aimee Mann, and Michael Penn. The album also included covers of three other Springsteen tracks from the same period: &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, &quot;Downbound Train&quot;, and &quot;Wages of Sin&quot;.
Other artists have discussed &quot;Nebraska&quot; impact on their music. Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s guitarist Tom Morello said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know there was music like that, that was as impactful and as heavy as &quot;Nebraska&quot; was. The alienation that I felt was for the first time expressed in music, and then I became a huge superfan.&quot; The singers Kelly Clarkson, Justin Vernon, and rock band the Killers cited &quot;Nebraska&quot; as an influence when making the albums &quot;My December&quot; (2007), &quot;For Emma, Forever Ago&quot; (2007), and &quot;Pressure Machine&quot; (2021), respectively. The singer-songwriters Aoife O&#x27;Donovan and Ryan Adams released full track-by-track covers of &quot;Nebraska&quot; in 2020 and 2022, respectively. O&#x27;Donovan performed the album live in its entirety several times throughout 2023. Zach Bryan cited &quot;Nebraska&quot; as his favorite album ever written, and used it as the recording template for his first two albums, &quot;DeAnn&quot; (2019) and &quot;Elisabeth&quot; (2020), with an additional nod in the lyrics to the title track of &quot;The Great American Bar Scene&quot; (2024). &quot;Nebraska&quot; was also a favorite of Richard Thompson, Rosanne Cash, and Steve Earle.

Outside of music, &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot; provided the inspiration for the 1991 film &quot;The Indian Runner&quot;. Written and directed by Sean Penn and starring David Morse and Viggo Mortensen, the film follows the same plot outline as the song, telling the story of a troubled relationship between two brothers, a deputy sheriff and a criminal. In literature, the short stories in Tennessee Jones&#x27;s book &quot;Deliver Me from Nowhere&quot; (2005) were inspired by the themes of &quot;Nebraska&quot;. The book takes its title from a line in &quot;Open All Night&quot; and &quot;State Trooper&quot;. David Burke&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness: Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s Nebraska&quot; (2011), analyzed the album&#x27;s influence decades after its release, while another book, Warren Zanes&#x27;s &quot;Deliver Me from Nowhere&quot; (2023), delved into the album&#x27;s making, featuring interviews between Zanes and Springsteen.

===&quot;Deliver Me from Nowhere&quot; film===

A biographical film based on the making of &quot;Nebraska&quot; is in production at 20th Century Studios. Written and directed by Scott Cooper, the film, based on Warren Zanes&#x27;s book &quot;Deliver Me from Nowhere&quot; (2023), follows Springsteen as he wrote and recorded the &quot;Nebraska&quot; songs, while dealing with the personal struggles of becoming a superstar. Titled &quot;Deliver Me from Nowhere&quot;, the film will star Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen, with Jeremy Strong, Odessa Young, Paul Walter Hauser, Harrison Gilbertson, Stephen Graham, and Johnny Cannizzaro in supporting roles. Springsteen and Jon Landau are both heavily involved in the project. In an interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Strong named &quot;Nebraska&quot; his favorite Springsteen album and spoke about its influence on him: &quot;It just always spoke to me, there&#x27;s a melancholy to it. I am doing [&quot;Deliver Me From Nowhere&quot;] but I&#x27;d always felt that way about that album. There&#x27;s a narrative to it that comes from a very deep place in him and you can feel that.&quot; Filming began at the end of October 2024. The film is expected to be released in 2025.

===PBS special===
A television special celebrating &quot;Nebraska&quot;, titled &quot;Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s Nebraska: A Celebration in Words and Music&quot;, aired on PBS on August 31, 2024. The special, hosted by Zanes, was filmed in Nashville on September 19, 2023, and features numerous musicians singing the album&#x27;s songs, including Emmylou Harris, Noah Kahan, and Lucinda Williams, interspersed with interviews from Zanes about the album&#x27;s legacy. Zanes stated in a statement announcing the special: &quot;I wrote a book about &quot;Nebraska&quot; because the recording stayed with me over decades. Every time there was trouble in my life I reached for &quot;Nebraska&quot;. When I started doing events around the book&#x27;s publication, I quickly realized the best of them had music. When I went to Nashville, I had a remarkable cast of musicians to help me tell this story.&quot;

==Reissues==
&quot;Nebraska&quot; was first released on CD in 1984. This was followed by an LP and CD reissue by CBS in 1988. Additional reissues followed in 2003 by Columbia and in 2008 by Sony BMG. In 2015, Sony Music released a remastered version of the album on both LP and CD. In October 2022, Sony Music reissued the album again on black smoke vinyl, featuring an original art print by Justin A. McHugh and a listening notes booklet with new sleeve notes by Springsteen&#x27;s biographer Peter Ames Carlin, to mark its 40th anniversary.

<doc id="195542" wikidata="Q1691660" url="?curid=195542" title="Joe Williams (jazz singer)">
<text>Joe Williams (born Joseph Goreed; December 12, 1918 – March 29, 1999) was an American jazz singer. He sang with big bands, such as the Count Basie Orchestra and the Lionel Hampton Orchestra, and with small combos. He sang in two films with the Basie orchestra and sometimes worked as an actor.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Cordele, Georgia, the son of Willie Goreed and Anne Beatrice, &quot;née&quot; Gilbert. When he was about three, his mother and grandmother took him to Chicago; he grew up on the South Side, where he attended Austin Otis Sexton Elementary School and Englewood High School. In the 1930s, as a teenager, he was a member of a gospel group, the Jubilee Boys, and performed in Chicago churches.

==Career==
Williams began singing professionally as a soloist in 1937. He sometimes sang with big bands: from 1937 he performed with Jimmie Noone&#x27;s Apex Club Orchestra, and also toured with Les Hite in the Midwest. In 1941, he toured with Coleman Hawkins to Memphis, Tennessee. In 1943, he performed in Boston with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra. He sang with Red Saunders at the Club DeLisa in Chicago in 1945, and in 1946 was in New York with Andy Kirk.

In the late 1940s, Williams was ill and performed on a sporadic basis. By October 1950, he was again at the Club DeLisa with Red Saunders, where Count Basie heard him.
From 1954 to 1961 he was the singer for the Count Basie Orchestra. &quot;Every Day I Have the Blues&quot;, recorded in 1955, and &quot;Alright, Okay, You Win&quot; were among many successful recordings from this period.

After leaving the Basie band, Williams had a successful career as a soloist at festivals, in clubs, and on television. He and Basie remained on good terms, and he regularly appeared with the Basie orchestra. He toured and made recordings with many other musicians, including Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison in 1961–62, Junior Mance between 1962 and 1964, George Shearing in 1971, and Cannonball Adderley between 1973 and 1975. He went on a long tour from Egypt to India with Clark Terry in 1977, and toured Europe and the United States with Thad Jones and the Basie Orchestra in 1985. He also worked with his own combos, which between 1970 and 1990 usually included the pianist Norman Simmons, and often had Henry Johnson on guitar.

Williams sang with the Basie orchestra in two films, &quot;Jamboree&quot; in 1957 and &quot;Cinderfella&quot; in 1960. He sometimes worked as an actor, and he had a supporting role in the movie &quot;The Moonshine War&quot; released in 1970. Williams appeared several times on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in the 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1982, Joe played the part of jazz musician Sonny Goodman in an episode (&quot;Jazz&quot;) of the television series &quot;Lou Grant&quot;. He later portrayed Al Hanks, father of Clair Huxtable, in three episodes of the 1984-1992 series &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (&quot;Clair&#x27;s Sister,&quot; season 2; &quot;The March,&quot; season 3; &quot;And So We Commence,&quot; season 8).

In later life, Williams often worked in hotels and clubs in Las Vegas, Nevada, but also sang at festivals and worked on cruise ships. He toured again with the Basie Orchestra, this time under the direction of Frank Foster, who had succeeded Thad Jones as leader of the band. Williams sang with the former Ellington Orchestra drummer Louie Bellson in Duke Ellington&#x27;s jazz suite &quot;Black, Brown and Beige&quot;; in about 1993 or 1994 he again toured with George Shearing.

==Death==
Williams died on March 29, 1999, in Las Vegas, at the age of 80. He had been hospitalized the week before for a respiratory ailment.

==Awards and honors==
Williams won the Best Jazz Vocal Performance Grammy Award for his LP &quot;Nothin&#x27; but the Blues&quot; in 1984; it was also the winning Traditional Blues Album in the Blues Music Awards of the Blues Foundation in the following year. Williams was nominated for seven other Grammy awards: for &quot;Prez &amp; Joe&quot; (1979); &quot;8 to 5 I Lose&quot; (1982); &quot;I Just Want To Sing&quot; (1986); &quot;Every Night: Live At Vine St.&quot; (1987); &quot;I Won&#x27;t Leave You Again&quot; (with Lena Horne, 1988); &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain&#x27;t My Baby&quot; (with Marlena Shaw, 1989); and &quot;In Good Company&quot; (1989).

In 1988, Williams received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. He also was a co-founder of the Fillius Jazz Archive from Hamilton College, where he also received an honorary degree.

In 1992, his 1955 recording of &quot;Every Day I Have the Blues&quot; with Basie was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame for recordings of particular historical or qualitative importance. Williams was added to the Jazz Wall of Fame of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 2001.

In 1988, with his wife Jillean and friends, Williams set up the not-for-profit Joe Williams Every Day Foundation to offer scholarships to talented young musicians.

<doc id="195545" wikidata="Q1370788" url="?curid=195545" title="Sinocentrism">
<text>Sinocentrism refers to a worldview that China is the cultural, political, or economic center of the world. Sinocentrism was a core concept in various Chinese dynasties. The Chinese considered themselves to be &quot;all-under-Heaven&quot;, ruled by the emperor, known as Son of Heaven. Those that lived outside of the Huaxia were regarded as &quot;barbarians&quot;. In addition, states outside of China, such as Japan or Korea, were considered to be vassals of China.

== Overview and context ==
Depending on the historical context, Sinocentrism can refer to either the ethnocentrism of the Han society and culture, or the modern concept of &quot;zhonghua minzu&quot;, popular among the Korean elites up to the final demise of the Qing dynasty. The concept came to an end in the 19th century and suffered several more blows in the 20th century, and as a result is not as widely popular among Chinese people in the present day.

In pre-modern times, it often took the form of viewing China as the most advanced civilization in the world, and external ethnic groups or foreign nations as being uncivilized to various degrees, a distinction known in Chinese as the Hua–Yi distinction.

== Sinocentric system ==
The Sinocentric system was a hierarchical system of international relations that prevailed in East Asia before the adoption of the Westphalian system in modern times. Surrounding states such as Japan (which cut off its vassal relationship with China during the Asuka period, because it regarded itself as an equal and individual culture), Korea, the Ryukyu Kingdom, and Vietnam were regarded as vassals of China. Relations between the Chinese Empire and these peoples were interpreted as tributary relationships under which these countries offered tributes to the Emperor of China. Areas not under Sinocentric influence were called &quot;Huawai zhi di&quot; (; &quot;lands outside of civilization&quot;).

At the center of the system stood China, ruled by a dynasty that had gained the Mandate of Heaven. This &quot;Celestial Dynasty&quot;, distinguished by its Confucian codes of morality and propriety, regarded itself as the most prominent civilization in the world; the Emperor of China was considered the only legitimate emperor of the entire world (all lands under heaven).

Under this scheme of international relations, only China could use the title of emperor whereas other states were ruled by kings. Chinese emperors were considered the Son of Heaven. The Japanese use of the term &quot;Tennō&quot; (; &quot;heavenly sovereign&quot;) for the rulers of Japan was a subversion of this principle. Throughout history, Koreans have sometimes referred to their rulers as king, conforming with traditional Korean belief of the Posterity of Heaven.

Identification of the heartland and the legitimacy of dynastic succession were both essential aspects of the system. Originally the center was synonymous with the Zhongyuan, an area that was expanded through invasion and conquest over many centuries. The dynastic succession was at times subject to radical changes in interpretation, such as the period of the Southern Song when the ruling dynasty lost the traditional heartland to the northern barbarians. Outside the center were several concentric circles. Local ethnic minorities were not regarded as &quot;foreign countries&quot;. However, they were governed by their native leaders called &quot;tusi&quot;, subject to recognition by the Chinese court, and were exempt from the Chinese bureaucratic system.

Outside this circle were the tributary states which offered tributes to the Chinese emperor and over which China exercised suzerainty. Under the Ming dynasty, when the tribute system entered its peak, these states were classified into a number of groups. The southeastern barbarians (category one) included some of the major states of East Asia and Southeast Asia, such as Korea, Japan, the Ryukyu Kingdom, Vietnam, Thailand, Champa, and Java. A second group of southeastern barbarians covered countries like Sulu, Malacca, and Sri Lanka. Many of these are independent states in modern times.

The situation was complicated by the fact that some tributary states had their own tributaries. Laos was a tributary of Vietnam while the Ryukyu Kingdom paid tribute to both China and Japan. Tsushima Island was also a tributary of the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties of Korea.

Beyond the circle of tributary states were countries in a trading relationship with China. The Portuguese, for instance, were allowed to trade with China from leased territory in Macau but did not officially enter the tributary system. During the Qing dynasty&#x27;s rule of Taiwan, some Qing officials have used the term &quot;Huawai zhi di&quot; to refer to Taiwan (Formosa), specifically to areas in Taiwan that have yet to be fully cultivated, developed and under the control of the Qing government.

While Sinocentrism tends to be identified as a politically inspired system of international relations, in fact it possessed an important economic aspect. The Sinocentric tribute and trade system provided Northeast and Southeast Asia with a political and economic framework for international trade. Countries wishing to trade with China were required to submit to a suzerain-vassal relationship with the Chinese sovereign. After investiture (; ) of the ruler in question, the missions were allowed to come to China to pay tribute to the Chinese emperor. In exchange, tributary missions were presented with return bestowals (; ). Special licences were issued to merchants accompanying these missions to carry out trade. Trade was also permitted at land frontiers and specified ports. This Sinocentric trade zone was based on the use of silver as a currency with prices set by reference to Chinese prices.

The Sinocentric model was not seriously challenged until contact with the European powers in the 18th and 19th century, in particular after the First Opium War. This was partly due to the fact that sustained contact between the Chinese Empire and other empires of the pre-modern period was limited. By the mid 19th century, imperial China was well past its peak and was on the verge of collapse.

In the late 19th century, the Sinocentric tributary state system in East Asia was superseded by the Westphalian multi-state system.

== Responses of other countries ==

Within Asia, the cultural and economic centrality of China was recognized, and most countries submitted to the Sinocentric model, if only to enjoy the benefits of a trading relationship. However, clear differences of nuance can be discerned in the responses of different countries.

=== Korea ===
Until the era of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, Southern Korean states had been protected from Chinese invasions by militarily powerful Northern Korean states such as Goguryeo which ruled the northern region of Korean peninsula and Manchuria. Goguryeo considered itself as an equally supreme state as China and adopted its own centric system to adjacent countries. Refusing to pay any tributes and continuing to conquer eastern territories of China altogether incurred a series of massive Chinese invasions of Goguryeo from 598 to 614, which ended disastrously, and they mainly contributed to the fall of Chinese Sui dynasty in 618. Such numerous defeats of the Chinese raised the sense of ethnic superiority in Goguryeo and further expansions into the Chinese territories continued.

After Goguryeo was collapsed by the allied forces of Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, and the Tang dynasty in 668, Silla, now being the sole ruler of Korean peninsula, more readily started the tribute system between Silla and Tang. However, such ties between two countries were weakened after Silla&#x27;s submission to Goryeo who claimed to succeed Goguryeo.

In the mid-Goryeo period, Korea idealized the Song dynasty and actively sought cultural assimilation into the Sinosphere. The relationship continued until the Mongol invasions of Korea and the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty where the two kingdoms fell, leading to the rise of the Yuan dynasty. After 30 years of fierce resistance, both Goryeo and Mongols finally sued for peace and Goryeo became a dependency of the Yuan dynasty. Soon after the weakening of Yuan dynasty, Goryeo retook their lost territories from the Yuan dynasty by military campaigns and regained her sovereign rights.

The Joseon dynasty (1392–1910) encouraged the entrenchment of Korean Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society and again willingly entered into the Sinocentric system. After the Ming dynasty, which regarded itself as huá (華), cultured civilization was considered to have collapsed under the invasion of the Qing, where the dominant Manchus were considered barbarian (夷) by Koreans. The Ming was thought of as the last true Sino culture (中華).

Sinocentrism waned further after Britain militarily defeated Qing China in the Second Opium War, creating an influx of Western culture with the decline of the Qing dynasty. Some Koreans especially those who studied abroad saw a need for reforms and associated Western civilization with modernization.

=== Vietnam ===

Vietnam (Đại Việt) had an intimate but not always peaceful relationship with China. Vietnam, originally independent, was part of various Chinese dynasties and kingdoms for approximately 900 years before gaining independence in the 10th century. In subsequent centuries the Vietnamese drove out Chinese invaders on a number of occasions, to the extent that conflict with China may be seen as one of the main themes of Vietnamese history.

However, Vietnam was also heavily Sinicized, adopting most aspects of Chinese culture, including the administrative system, architecture, philosophy, religion, literature of China, and even a general cultural outlook. Classical Chinese (Chữ Hán) was adopted as national writing system since the Triệu dynasty. Vietnamese merchants along with Chinese merchants had the important roles in spreading of Hanzi and Confucianism to the world. First Vietnamese reached the Persian shores in the late 1st century. Vietnam persistently identified itself in relation to China, regarding itself as the kingdom of the south as against China in the north, as seen in this line from a poem (in Classical Chinese) by General Lý Thường Kiệt (李常傑) (1019–1105): &quot;Nam Quốc sơn hà Nam Đế cư&quot;. (南國山河南帝居), which means &quot;Over mountains and rivers of the South reigns the Emperor of the South&quot;.

In adopting Chinese customs, the Vietnamese court also began to adopt Sinocentric world view during the expanding Later Lê and Nguyễn dynasties. &quot;Trung Quốc&quot; 中國 was used as a name for Vietnam by Emperor Gia Long in 1805. It was said &quot;Hán di hữu hạn&quot; 漢夷有限 (&quot;the Vietnamese and the barbarians must have clear borders&quot;) by the Gia Long Emperor (Nguyễn Phúc Ánh) when differentiating between Khmer and Vietnamese. Minh Mang implemented an acculturation integration policy directed at minority non-Vietnamese peoples. Thanh nhân 清人 was used to refer to ethnic Chinese by the Vietnamese while Vietnamese called themselves as Hán nhân 漢人 in Vietnam during the 1800s under Nguyễn rule. Cambodia was regularly called &quot;Cao Man Quốc&quot; (高蠻國), the country of &quot;upper barbarians&quot;. In 1815, Gia Long claimed 13 countries as Vietnamese vassals, including Luang Prabang, Vientiane, Burma, Tran Ninh in eastern Laos, and two countries called &quot;Thủy Xá Quốc&quot; and &quot;Hỏa Xá Quốc&quot;, which were actually Malayo-Polynesian Jarai tribes living between Vietnam and Cambodia. Mirroring the Chinese model, the Vietnamese court attempted to regulate the presentation of tribute to the Vietnamese court, participation in New Year and emperor&#x27;s birthday ceremonies, as well as the travel routes and size of tributary missions.

Vietnamese Nguyen Emperor Minh Mạng sinicized ethnic minorities such as Khmer and Cham, claimed the legacy of Confucianism and China&#x27;s Han dynasty for Vietnam, and used the term Han people 漢人 (Hán nhân) to refer to the Vietnamese. Minh Mang declared that &quot;We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.&quot; These policies were directed at the Khmer and hill tribes. The Nguyen lord Nguyen Phuc Chu had referred to Vietnamese as &quot;Han people&quot; in 1712 when differentiating between Vietnamese and Chams. The Nguyen Lords established đồn điền after 1790. It was said &quot;Hán di hữu hạn&quot; 漢夷有限 (&quot;the Vietnamese and the barbarians must have clear borders&quot;) by the Gia Long Emperor (Nguyễn Phúc Ánh) when differentiating between Khmer and Vietnamese. Minh Mang implemented an acculturation integration policy directed at minority non-Vietnamese peoples. Thanh nhân 清人 or Đường nhân 唐人 were used to refer to ethnic Chinese by the Vietnamese while Vietnamese called themselves as Hán dân 漢民 and Hán nhân 漢人 in Vietnam during the 1800s under Nguyễn rule.

Chinese style clothing was forced on Vietnamese people by the Nguyễn. Trousers have been adopted by White H&#x27;mong. The trousers replaced the traditional skirts of the females of the White Hmong. The tunics and trouser clothing of the Han Chinese on the Ming tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. The Áo dài was created when tucks which were close fitting and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. Trousers and tunics on the Chinese pattern in 1774 were ordered by the Nguyễn Phúc Khoát to replace the sarong type Vietnamese clothing. The Chinese clothing in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam&#x27;s north area in isolated hamlets wear skirts were worn. The Chinese Qin and Han dynasty state clothing was ordered to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats since Vietnam under Triệu rule Triệu Đà (179 BC).

Chinese influence waned as French influence rose in the 19th century, and Vietnam eventually abolished the Imperial examinations and stopped using Chữ Hán and the related Chữ Nôm script in the 20th century in official.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, an ambivalent tone was set early in its relationship with China. Shōtoku Taishi (574–622), Prince Regent of Japan, is famous for having sent a letter to the Emperor of China starting with the words: &quot;The Emperor of the land where the sun rises sends a letter to the Emperor of the land where the sun sets to ask if you are healthy&quot; (日出處天子致書日沒處天子無恙云云). This is commonly believed as the origin of the name Nihon (source of the sun), although the actual characters for Nihon (日本) were not used.

Not long after this, however, Japan remodeled its entire state and administrative apparatus on the Chinese system under the Taika Reform (645), the beginning of a period of Chinese influence on many aspects of Japanese culture until Imperial Japanese embassies to China were abolished in 894.

In 1401, during the Muromachi period (室町時代), the &quot;shōgun&quot; Yoshimitsu (足利義満) restarted the lapsed tribute system (1401), describing himself in a letter to the Chinese Emperor as &quot;Your subject, the King of Japan&quot; while also a subject of the Japanese Emperor. The benefit of the tribute system was a profitable trade. The trade was called &quot;Kangō&quot; trade (means tally trade) and Japanese products were traded for Chinese goods. This relationship ended with the last envoy of Japanese monk Sakugen Shūryō in 1551, which was Ashikaga Yoshiteru&#x27;s era, including a 20 years suspension by Ashikaga Yoshimochi. These embassies were sent to China on 19 occasions.

During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty of China, Japan thought of China as no longer a genuine Chinese land. Subsequently, Japan often used the names &quot;China&quot; and &quot;Huaxia&quot; to refer to itself.

In the years 1592–1593, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, having unified Japan, tried to conquer Korea as a prelude to conquering Ming China. The attempt to conquer &quot;all under heaven&quot; (itself a sinocentric concept identifying China as &quot;the world&quot;) ended in failure.

Japanese responses to Sinocentric concepts have not always been so straightforward. The Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 evoked a national consciousness of the role of the kamikaze (神風) in defeating the enemy. Less than fifty years later (1339–43), Kitabatake Chikafusa wrote the Jinnō Shōtōki (神皇正統記, &#x27;Chronicle of the Direct Descent of the Divine Sovereigns&#x27;) emphasizing the divine descent of the imperial line. The Jinnō Shōtōki provided a Shinto view of history stressing the divine nature of Japan and its spiritual supremacy over China and India.

In the Tokugawa era, the study of Kokugaku () arose as an attempt to reconstruct and recover the authentic native roots of Japanese culture, particularly Shinto, excluding later elements borrowed from China. In 1657, Tokugawa Mitsukuni established the Mito School, which was charged with writing a history of Japan as a perfect exemplar of a &quot;nation&quot; under Confucian thought, with the emphasis on unified rule by the emperors and respect for the imperial court and Shinto deities.

In an ironic affirmation of the spirit of Sinocentrism, claims were even heard that the Japanese, not the Chinese, were the legitimate heirs of Chinese culture. Reasons included that the Imperial House of Japan never died out comparing to the rise and fall of Chinese monarchs in the past, and that Japan was free of barbarism like Qing dynasty&#x27;s forced adoption of Manchu queue and clothing on Han Chinese after 1644. Combined with Shinto, came the concept of &quot;Shinkoku/the Divine Kingdom (). In the early Edo period, neo-Confucianist Yamaga Sokō asserted that Japan was superior to China in Confucian terms and more deserving of the name &quot;&quot;Chūgoku&quot;. Other scholars picked this up, notably Aizawa Seishisai, an adherent of the Mito School, in his political tract &quot;Shinron&quot; (新論 New Theses) in 1825.

As a country that had much to gain by eclipsing Chinese power in East Asia, Japan in more recent times has perhaps been most ardent in identifying and demolishing what it dismissively calls &quot;Chūka shisō&quot; (中華思想), loosely meaning &quot;Zhonghua&quot; ideology&quot;. One manifestation of Japanese resistance to Sinocentrism was the insistence for many years in the early 20th century on using the name &quot;Shina&quot; () for China, based on the Western word &#x27;China&#x27;, in preference to &quot;Chūgoku&quot; (中国 Central Country) advocated by the Chinese themselves.

=== Burma ===
Unlike East Asian states, which communicated in written Chinese, Burma used a different written language in its communications with China. While China consistently regarded Burma as a vassal, Burmese records indicate that Burma considered itself as China&#x27;s equal. Under the Burmese interpretation, Burma was the &quot;younger brother&quot; and China was the &quot;elder brother&quot;.

=== Thailand ===
Thailand was subordinate to China as a tributary state from the Sui dynasty until the Taiping Rebellion of the late Qing dynasty in the mid-19th century. The Sukhothai Kingdom established official relations with the Yuan dynasty during the reign of King Ram Khamhaeng. Wei Yuan, the 19th century Chinese scholar, considered Thailand to be the strongest and most loyal of China&#x27;s Southeast Asian tributaries, citing the time when Thailand offered to directly attack Japan to divert the Japanese in their planned invasions of Korea and the Asian mainland, as well as other acts of loyalty to the Ming dynasty. Thailand was welcoming and open to Chinese immigrants, who dominated commerce and trade, and achieved high positions in the government.

=== Sri Lanka ===

The last Sri Lankan kingdom, the Kingdom of Kandy (1469–1815), did not establish any significant relationships with imperial China. However, the preceding Kotte kingdom (1412–1597) had significant interactions with Ming China. Parakramabahu VI of Kotte, the founder of Kotte, established a significant alliance with Ming China during his reign, resulting in noteworthy political and economic consequences for the region. This alliance led to the removal of Vira Alakesvara of Gampola from the throne in favor of Parakramabahu VI, with documented details found in Chinese records.

Historical accounts reveal that Parakramabahu VI&#x27;s legitimacy was fortified through a selection process at the Ming court. He was nominated by the Yongle Ming emperor and subsequently installed into power by Admiral Zheng He. This transition was ensured by the commanding presence of Zheng He&#x27;s formidable fleet. This collaboration marked the beginning of an era characterized by increased economic interaction between the Ming dynasty and the Kotte kingdom. In order to strengthen these relations, Parakramabahu VI initiated several diplomatic missions, totaling at least five, to China. These missions aimed to affirm the cessation of sea piracy within the Sea of Kotte.

A notable legacy of Parakramabahu VI&#x27;s reign is attributed to Admiral Zheng He, who made a lasting impact on Sri Lanka. This is exemplified by the installation of the Galle Trilingual inscription, serving as an artifact that attests to the interactions between the two nations during this historical period.
Sri Lanka, like Japan, was considered &quot;yuanyi&quot; (remote foreigners; 遠夷) in &quot;jueyu&quot; (remote territories; 絕域) under the Imperial Chinese Tributary System.

=== Europe ===
One of the most historically well-known official encounter between Sinocentric attitudes and Europeans was the Macartney Embassy of 1792–93, which sought to establish a permanent British presence in Peking and establish official trade relations. The rejection of the Chinese Emperor to the British overtures and the British refusal to kowtow to the Emperor has passed into legend in British and Chinese folklore. In response to the British request to recognise Macartney as official ambassador, the Emperor wrote:

The Celestial Empire, ruling all within the four seas, simply concentrates on carrying out the affairs of Government properly ... We have never valued ingenious articles, nor do we have the slightest need of your country&#x27;s manufactures, therefore O King, as regards to your request to send someone to remain at the capital, which it is not in harmony with the regulations of the Celestial Empire – we also feel very much that it is of no advantage to your country.

== Cultural Sinocentrism ==

In a cultural sense, Sinocentrism can refer to the tendency among both Chinese and foreigners to regard the culture of China as more ancient than or superior to other cultures. This often involves regarding neighboring countries as mere cultural offshoots of China. The geographical dimension of traditional Sinocentrism was highlighted by Chinese reactions to the publication of the first world map by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci (1552–1610):
Lately Matteo Ricci utilized some false teachings to fool people, and scholars unanimously believed him...The Map of the World which he made contains elements of the fabulous and mysterious, and is a down right attempt to deceive people on things which they personally cannot go to verify for themselves...We need not discuss other points, but just take for example the position of China on the map. He puts it not in the center but slightly to the West and inclined to the north. This is altogether far from the truth, for China should be in the center of the world, which we can prove by the single fact that we can see the North Star resting at the zenith of the heaven at midnight.

In the late Ming and Qing dynasties, there was a belief in Chinese cultural circles that knowledge entering China from the West had already existed in China in the past. This trend of thought was known in Chinese as &quot;xi xue zhong yuan&quot; (). &quot;Xi xue zhong yuan&quot; was a way to not only enhance the prestige of ancient Chinese learning, but also that of Western learning and make it more acceptable to the Chinese at that time.

One notable example was &quot;Chouren Zhuan&quot; (), a book by the Qing dynasty scholar Ruan Yuan which adopted the point of view that some Western sciences had an ancient Chinese origin. Scholars such as Ruan saw astronomy and mathematics as a key to deciphering the ancient classics. Until the Sino-Japanese War, some intellectuals believed that some of the sciences and technologies coming from Europe were actually lost ancient Chinese knowledge. The Chinese have abandoned the idea of &quot;xi xue zhong yuan&quot; since the early 20th century.

Cultural Sinocentrism was the political and cultural core of the region: traditional Chinese language and writing system, ideological frames of the Confucian social and familial order; legal and administrative systems; Buddhism and the art of historiography were used in China, the Korean peninsula (Korean Confucianism) and also Vietnam.

=== Indigenous criticism ===

Followers of Chinese Buddhism were some of the fiercest critics of Sinocentrism, since they followed a religion that originated in India, rather than China. The monk Zhiyi (538–597 CE) referred to China as &quot;Zhendan&quot; (), rather than by any epithet for China that emphasized China&#x27;s centrality, such as Zhōngguó (the modern name of China, ) or Zhonghua (). &quot;Zhendan&quot; originated in a transcription of the Sanskrit word for China, . Another anti-Sinocentric name for China used by Buddhists was &quot;country of the Han&quot; () or &quot;region of the Han&quot;. Reacting to an insecurity against China&#x27;s indigenous religions of Confucianism and Daoism, Buddhists in China asserted that Confucius and Yan Hui were avatars of the Buddha, and that Confucianism was merely an offshoot of Buddhism. When Buddhists had influence in the court, such as in the minority-led Yuan dynasty, they successfully persuaded the imperial governments to censor and destroy Daoist texts. They especially hated the &quot;Huahujing&quot;, which made the opposite argument to that of the Buddhists; that Buddhism was an offshoot of Daoism.

Liu Ji, one of the key advisors of the Ming-dynasty founder Zhu Yuanzhang, generally supported the idea that while the Chinese and the non-Chinese are different, they are actually equal. Liu was therefore arguing against the idea that the Chinese were and are superior to other people.

Culturally, one of the most famous attacks on Sinocentrism and its associated beliefs was made by the author Lu Xun in &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot;, in which the protagonist is humiliated and defeated; satirizing the ridiculous way in which he claimed &quot;spiritual victories&quot; in spite of this.

== Today ==
The influence of the Sinocentric model of political relations and Sinocentric belief in cultural superiority (especially against the West) declined in the 19th century. The Sinocentric ideology suffered a further blow when Imperial Japan, having undergone the Meiji Restoration, defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese War. As a result, China adopted the Westphalian system of equal independent states.

In modern Chinese foreign policy, the People&#x27;s Republic of China has repeatedly stated that it will never seek to establish hegemony beyond its borders (). However, some historians, such as John Friend and Bradley Thayer believe there are individuals in the Chinese government who doggedly hold onto Sinocentric beliefs. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Xi Jinping has called for a &#x27;pan-Asian security concept&#x27;, which has been compared to Imperial Japan by commentators.

== Related concepts ==
Successive peoples from the north, such as the Xianbei, Jurchens, Mongols, or Manchus, were quite willing to place themselves at the center of the model, although they were not always successful. The Xianbei empires during the Northern and Southern dynasties, for example, regarded the Han regimes of southern China as &quot;barbarians&quot; because they refused to submit to Xianbei rule. Similarly, the Manchu-led Qing dynasty regarded the Westerners they encountered in the mid-19th century as &quot;barbarians&quot; due to their &quot;uncouth manners&quot;.

Sinocentrism is not synonymous with Chinese nationalism. The successive dynasties in China&#x27;s history were Sinocentric in the sense that Chinese nationalism, in contrast, is a more modern concept (nationalism) focused primarily on the idea of a unified, cohesive, and powerful Chinese nation state, as one of the nations of the world.

<text>Konstantin Petrovich Feoktistov (; 7 February 1926 – 21 November 2009), was Russian engineer and a cosmonaut in the former Soviet space program. 

As a cosmonaut Feoktistov flew on Voskhod 1, the first spacecraft to carry three crew members. Feoktistov also wrote several books on space technology and exploration. The Feoktistov crater on the far side of the Moon is named in his honor.

== Biography ==
During the Nazi occupation of Voronezh, at the age of just 16, Feoktistov fought with the Soviet Army against the German troops, carrying out reconnaissance missions for the Voronezh Front. After being captured by a Waffen-SS Army patrol, Feoktistov was shot by a German officer. However, the bullet went right through his chin and neck and did not kill him. Feoktistov could crawl out later and then make his way to the Soviet lines.

After the war was over, Feoktistov enrolled in the Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School as an engineering student and he graduated in 1949. Feoktistov also later earned a doctorate in physics. He joined Mikhail Tikhonravov&#x27;s OKB (design bureau), and in 1955, Feoktistov formed part of the team that went on to design the Sputnik satellites, the Vostok space capsule, the Voskhod space capsule, and the Soyuz space capsule under the leadership of the Soviet Chief Designer Sergey Korolev. During this time, Feoktistov also worked on a design for an ion-propelled spacecraft capable of taking humans to Mars.

In 1964, Feoktistov was selected as part of a group of engineers for cosmonaut training, and in October of that same year, he was hastily assigned to the multi-disciplinary Voskhod 1 crew. He was the first civilian to make a space flight, and the only cosmonaut in the Soviet Union who was not a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He spent just over 24 hours and 17 minutes in space during his space flight.

After the flight of Voskhod 1, Feoktistov&#x27;s training for any further space mission was discontinued for medical reasons. However, Feoktistov continued his outer space engineering work, and he later became the head of the Soviet space design bureau that designed the Salyut and Mir space stations.

In October 1969, Konstantin Feoktistov and Georgi Beregovoi traveled as guests of NASA throughout the US, visiting any city they chose and Disneyland in California – they were joined on the trip by US astronauts as hosts, including Eugene Cernan, Neil Armstrong and others. Kirk Douglas and others hosted receptions for them in Hollywood – they were protected by special agents of the US State Department on request of NASA. Almost every place they went when accompanied by Eugene Cernan, if a band was present the song &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; was played – when they visited Disneyland they enjoyed the ride Trip To The Moon, then joked with the US astronauts that they went to Disneyland and not the Moon. It was a trip that all enjoyed and international friendships were made.
Feoktistov resigned from his engineering position with Energia and then returned to Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School as a professor in 1990.

<doc id="195550" wikidata="Q927318" url="?curid=195550" title="USS United States (1797)">
<text>USS &quot;United States&quot; was a wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy and the first of the six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of 1794. The name &quot;United States&quot; was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed. Joshua Humphreys designed the frigates to be the young Navy&#x27;s capital ships, and so &quot;United States&quot; and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than typical frigates of the period. She was built at Humphrey&#x27;s shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and launched on 10 May 1797 and immediately began duties with the newly formed United States Navy protecting American merchant shipping during the Quasi-War with France.

In 1861, &quot;United States&quot; was in port at Norfolk when she was seized by the Virginia Navy. She was commissioned into the Confederate navy as CSS &quot;United States&quot;, but was later scuttled by Confederate forces. The U.S. Navy raised &quot;United States&quot; after retaking Norfolk, Virginia, but the aged and damaged ship was not returned to service; instead, &quot;United States&quot; was held at the Norfolk Navy Yard until she was broken up in December 1865.

==Design and construction==
During the 1790s American merchant vessels began to fall prey to Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean, most notably from Algiers. Congress&#x27;s response was the Naval Act of 1794. The Act provided funds for the construction of six frigates; however, it included a clause stating that construction of the ships would cease if the United States agreed to peace terms with Algiers.

Joshua Humphreys&#x27; design was deep, long on keel and narrow of beam (width) for mounting very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States could not match the navy sizes of the European states. He therefore designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.

Originally designated as &quot;Frigate A&quot; and subsequently named &quot;United States&quot; by President George Washington, her keel was laid down in 1795 at Humphreys&#x27; shipyard in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Humphreys was assigned as her constructor and John Barry as its captain and was the first commissioned Captain of the newly established U.S. Navy. As Philadelphia was at the time America&#x27;s capital, many visitors walked through observing her construction as it progressed. Humphreys personally led President Washington and First Lady Martha on a tour. The President expressed his admiration of the great size of the ship. A less desirable visitor, Benjamin Franklin Bache (grandson of Benjamin Franklin) was physically assaulted by Clement Humphreys (Joshua&#x27;s son) allegedly over Bache&#x27;s opposition to the Federalist Party and his opposition newspaper, the &quot;Philadelphia Aurora&quot;.

Fearing sabotage, Humphreys was concerned about the open nature of his ship yard which allowed anyone to wander in. He requested from the War Department a number of guards which were posted to keep out visitors but to little effect.

Construction slowly continued until a peace treaty was announced between the United States and Algiers in March 1796. In accordance with the clause in the Naval Act, construction of &quot;United States&quot; was discontinued. President Washington requested instructions from Congress on how to proceed. Several proposals circulated before a final decision was reached allowing Washington to complete the three frigates nearest to completion; &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;Constellation&quot; and &quot;Constitution&quot; were chosen.

On 10 May 1797 she was the first American warship to be launched under the Naval Act of 1794, and the first ship of the United States Navy. She was fitted out at Philadelphia during the spring of 1798 and, on 3 July ordered to proceed to sea. Relations with the French government had deteriorated, starting the Quasi-War.

===Armament===
&quot;United States&quot;″s nominal rating was that of a 44-gun ship. However, she usually carried over 50 guns. &quot;United States&quot; was originally armed with a battery of 55 guns: thirty-two 24-pounder (10.9 kg) cannon; twenty-two 42-pounder (19 kg) carronades; and one 18-pounder (8 kg) long gun.

Unlike modern naval vessels, ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns. Guns were portable and often exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer modified his vessel&#x27;s armaments to his liking, taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, a vessel&#x27;s armament would change often during its career; records of the changes were not generally kept.

==Quasi-War==
&quot;United States&quot; sailed with &quot;Delaware&quot; to Boston where they were to meet with and
 to form a patrol squadron. Shortly afterward Barry sighted a frigate showing French colors. Raising his own French flag, Barry maneuvered closer and when reaching it, hoisted the American colors. As Barry was about to open fire on the frigate, she changed to the English flag and identified herself as , narrowly avoiding being fired upon. When reaching Boston, Barry learned that &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Pickering&quot; were not ready to sail and he decided to continue without them. &quot;United States&quot; and &quot;Delaware&quot; departed for the West Indies on 26 July

In the ensuing two months two French privateers were captured, &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; on 23 August and &quot;Jalouse&quot; on 5 September and brought into New Castle, Delaware on 20 September. &quot;United States&quot; put to sea again on 17 October with orders to cruise along the New England coast and eastward. However, a severe gale arose the following day and &quot;United States&quot; was disabled with a sprung bowsprit and slackened rigging. Emergency repairs had to be made. After the storm passed, she made her way back to Delaware, arriving on 9 November. Barry received orders in December which returned &quot;United States&quot; to the West Indies, taking command of the American squadron there. This squadron, in addition to &quot;United States&quot;, would by early 1799 include: , , , , &quot;Herald&quot; and the revenue cutters &quot;Pickering&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Scammel&quot;, and &quot;Diligence&quot;.

On 13 January 1799 French batteries at Deshaies, Guadeloupe fired 9 rounds at her, but all missed. On 3 February 1799, &quot;United States&quot; sighted a French ship and began a five-hour pursuit of the schooner &quot;L&#x27;Amour de la Patrie&quot;. After coming in close to the vessel, &quot;United States&quot; opened fire; the third shot went completely through &quot;L&#x27;Amour de la Patrie&quot;, sinking her rapidly. Barry sent out his boats to collect survivors of the schooner, and they were taken prisoner. &quot;United States&quot; then set a course for Guadeloupe to arrange a prisoner exchange with the French, but Barry&#x27;s flag of truce was ignored when shore batteries opened fire on the boat carrying Barry&#x27;s envoy. Barry returned to &quot;United States&quot; and ordered his gun crews to bombard the batteries in return. On 26 February, &quot;United States&quot; pursued the French privateer &quot;Democrat&quot;, which had recently taken prize of the English ship . &quot;United States&quot; recaptured &quot;Cicero&quot; but the pursuit of &quot;Democrat&quot; ended when she escaped into shallow water. &quot;United States&quot; also recaptured &quot;Maria&quot;, another one of &quot;Democrat&quot;″s prizes, and sent both &quot;Cicero&quot; and &quot;Maria&quot; into Martinique.

Returning to Guadeloupe, Barry made another attempt at a prisoner exchange. However, Governor Edme Étienne Borne Desfourneaux told Barry he held no prisoners because there was no war with the United States. Though skeptical, Barry released his prisoners.

On 26 March, &quot;United States&quot; took the French privateer &quot;La Tartueffe&quot; and its prize, the American ship &quot;Vermont&quot; southeast of Antigua. Also recorded is the capture of &quot;Le Bonaparte&quot; sometime in 1799. In April, Barry turned over command of the squadron to Thomas Truxtun. &quot;United States&quot; sailed for home and arrived at New Castle, Delaware, on 9 May. Barry recruited new crew members to replace the ones whose enlistments had expired while &quot;United States&quot; underwent refitting and repairs. She sailed again 1 July with orders to patrol the southern Atlantic coast of the United States. Encountering a storm on the 6th which sprung her bowsprit, she continued on to deliver an artillery company to Fort Moultrie and then put into the Gosport Navy Yard for repairs on the 22nd. Returning to patrols on 13 August, &quot;United States&quot; experienced an uneventful period and at times sailed in company with &quot;George Washington&quot; and .

&quot;United States&quot; returned to Newport, Rhode Island, in September and Barry waited for further orders. In October those orders were to deliver Oliver Ellsworth and William Davie as envoys to France to negotiate a settlement of the Quasi War. &quot;United States&quot; departed on 3 November arriving at Lisbon, Portugal on 27 November, departing for Lorient on 21 December but had to put in to Corunna on 11 January 1800 due to bad weather, and returned in early April 1800. She remained in port for needed repairs until December when Barry was ordered to return to the West Indies. The treaty of peace with France was ratified on 3 February 1801 and &quot;United States&quot; returned home in April. An act of Congress, passed on 3 March 1801 and signed by President John Adams, retained thirteen frigates. Seven of those frigates, including &quot;United States&quot;, were to be placed in a reserve fleet. Ordered to the Washington Navy Yard, &quot;United States&quot; was decommissioned there along with and . In a letter dated 12 November, 1802 Midshipman Ralph Izard was ordered to take command with the rank of Sailing Master.

==War of 1812==
&quot;United States&quot; remained in the Washington Navy Yard throughout the First Barbary War of 1801–1805 and up until 1809, when orders were given to ready her for active service. On 10 June 1810, now under the command of Stephen Decatur, she sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, for refitting.

While she was at Norfolk, Captain John S. Carden of the Royal Navy, commander of the new British frigate HMS &quot;Macedonian&quot;, wagered Captain Decatur a beaver hat that his vessel would take &quot;United States&quot; if the two should ever meet in battle. Ichabod B. Crane, whose name was appropriated for the main character in &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, served under Decatur as a lieutenant in the marine detachment aboard ship.

The United States declared war against Britain on 18 June 1812. Three days later Decatur and &quot;United States&quot; sailed from New York City within a squadron under the command of Commodore John Rodgers in . Other ships of the squadron were , &quot;Hornet&quot;, and &quot;Argus&quot;; departed on a seventy-day North Atlantic cruise. A passing American merchant ship informed Rodgers about a fleet of British merchantmen en route to Britain from Jamaica. Rodgers and his squadron sailed in pursuit, and on 23 June encountered what was later learned to be HMS &quot;Belvidera&quot;.

&quot;United States&quot; and the squadron returned to pursuing the Jamaican fleet and on 1 July began to follow the trail of coconut shells and orange peels the Jamaicans had left behind them. &quot;United States&quot; sailed to within one day&#x27;s journey of the English Channel but never sighted the convoy. Rodgers called off the pursuit on 13 July. During their return trip to Boston, the squadron captured seven merchant ships and recaptured one American vessel.

After some refitting, &quot;United States&quot;, still under Decatur&#x27;s command, sailed again 8 October with Rodgers but on the 12th parted from the squadron for her own patrol.

Three days later, after capturing &quot;Mandarin&quot;, &quot;United States&quot; parted company and continued to cruise eastward. At dawn, on the 25th, five hundred miles south of the Azores, lookouts on board &quot;United States&quot; reported seeing a sail 12 miles (19 km) to windward. As the ship rose over the horizon, Captain Decatur made out the familiar lines of HMS &quot;Macedonian&quot;.

===&quot;United States&quot; vs &quot;Macedonian&quot;===
Both ships were immediately cleared for action and commenced maneuvers at 0900. Captain Carden elected not to risk crossing the bows of &quot;United States&quot; to rake her, but chose instead to haul closer to the wind on a parallel course with the American vessel. For his part, Decatur intended to engage &quot;Macedonian&quot; from fairly long range, where his 24-pounders (11 kg) would have the advantage over the 18-pounders (8 kg) of the British.

The actual battle developed according to Decatur&#x27;s plan. &quot;United States&quot; began the action at 0920 by firing an inaccurate broadside at &quot;Macedonian&quot;. This was answered immediately by the British vessel, bringing down a small spar of &quot;United States&quot;. Decatur&#x27;s next broadside destroyed &quot;Macedonian&quot;″s mizzen top mast, letting her driver gaff fall and so giving the advantage in maneuver to the American frigate. &quot;United States&quot; next took up position off &quot;Macedonian&quot;″s quarter and proceeded to riddle her with shot. By noon, &quot;Macedonian&quot; was a dismasted hulk and was forced to surrender. She had suffered 104 casualties against 12 in &quot;United States&quot;, which emerged from the battle relatively unscathed.

The two ships lay alongside each other for over two weeks while &quot;Macedonian&quot; was repaired sufficiently to sail. &quot;United States&quot; and her prize entered New York Harbor on 4 December amid jubilation over the victory. Captain Decatur and his crew were received with praise from both Congress and President James Madison.

===Aftermath===

&quot;Macedonian&quot; was subsequently purchased by the United States Navy, repaired, and placed in service. After repairs, &quot;United States&quot;—accompanied by USS &quot;Macedonian&quot; and the sloop &quot;Hornet&quot;—sailed from New York on 24 May 1813. A noteworthy event of this mission is documentation of two women among the crew of &quot;United States&quot;. Two sailors onboard &quot;United States&quot;, a Mr. Marshall and Briton William Goodman (who enlisted under the false name John Allen) were encouraged by Decatur to bring their wives, Mary Marshall and Mary Allen, on the voyage as nurses to care for the wounded if the ship engaged the enemy. They are believed to be the first women to serve aboard a United States warship. On 1 June, the three vessels were driven into New London, Connecticut, by a powerful British squadron which included ships of the line, and &quot;United States&quot; and &quot;Macedonian&quot; were kept blocked there until the end of the war. Both ships were disarmed and their crews and weapons despatched to the squadrons on the Great Lakes &quot;Hornet&quot; managed to slip through the blockade on 14 November 1814 and escape to sea.

Decatur was transferred to the frigate &quot;President&quot; in the spring of 1814, and he took some of the officers and crew of &quot;United States&quot; with him to his new command.

==Second Barbary War==
Soon after the United States declared war against Britain in 1812, Algiers took advantage of the United States&#x27; preoccupation with Britain and began intercepting American merchant ships in the Mediterranean. On 2 March 1815, at the request of President James Madison, Congress declared war on Algiers. Work preparing two American squadrons promptly began—one at Boston under Commodore William Bainbridge, and one at New York under Commodore Steven Decatur. &quot;United States&quot; was assigned under Bainbridge but required repairs and refitting from her period in port for the latter part of the War of 1812. She was not ready for sea when Bainbridge departed Boston on 3 July.

&quot;United States&quot; finally departed for the Mediterranean two months later under the command of Captain John Shaw; arriving at Gibraltar on 25 September. Soon after, Shaw learned that Commodore Decatur had already secured a peace treaty with Algiers. Now part of a large gathering of U.S. Navy ships, &quot;United States&quot; was chosen to remain behind with , , and . They were later joined by , and .

The senior American naval officer in the region, Captain Shaw became commodore and commanded the squadron consisting of &quot;Constellation&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Erie&quot; and &quot;Ontario&quot; until Commodore Isaac Chauncey arrived 1 July 1816 and took overall command. Nevertheless, &quot;United States&quot;, despite losing her position as flagship, continued to serve in the Mediterranean until she sailed for home in the spring of 1819 and reached Hampton Roads on 18 May. The frigate was decommissioned on 9 June 1819 and laid up at Norfolk.

==Squadron duty==
&quot;United States&quot; returned to duty in November 1823 under the command of Commodore Isaac Hull. After repairs and preparation she sailed on 5 January 1824, to relieve Commodore Charles Stewart in the Pacific. Accompanying Hull was his wife and sister-in-law Jeanette Hart.

&quot;United States&quot; made a stop en route to the Pacific at Rio de Janeiro and reached Valparaiso, Chile by 7 March. Commodore Hull found that Chile was now independent and had been acknowledged by Spain, though hostilities still continued with Peru; Callao was held by the Spaniards and blockaded by the Peruvian fleet. The United States&#x27; position was one of strict neutrality in the war and Hull&#x27;s orders contained the main objective of overseeing and protecting American commerce. &quot;United States&quot; sailed for Callao, arriving on 4 April. Commodore Stewart, in command of was relieved by Hull and sailed for home. Under Hull&#x27;s command, a squadron of US Navy ships consisted of , , and .

&quot;United States&quot; remained in the vicinity of Peru and her duty there was mostly uneventful. In the autumn of 1825, Hull placed Lieutenant John Percival in command of &quot;Dolphin&quot; and tasked him with searching for mutineers from the American whaling ship &quot;Globe&quot;. Percival found only two of the mutineers but discovered an uncharted island that he named &quot;Hull&#x27;s Island&quot;; now known as Îles Maria. Percival continued on to Hawaii and reportedly caused discontent with the tribal chiefs and missionaries. Hull placed Thomas ap Catesby Jones in command of &quot;Peacock&quot; and dispatched him to Hawaii to ascertain the behavior of Percival. However, upon Jones&#x27; arrival, Percival had already departed. With Hull&#x27;s tour of duty now expired, &quot;United States&quot; departed from Callao on 16 December 1826 and arrived at the New York Navy Yard on 24 April 1827.

She put into the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1828 for extensive repairs and remained there until 1830 when she was placed in reserve at the New York Navy Yard. The frigate remained at New York through 1832 and was thoroughly modernized.
On 3 July 1832, she sailed under Capt. J. B. Nicholson to join Commodore Patterson&#x27;s squadron in the Mediterranean, returning to New York 11 December 1834.
From 1836 to 1838, under Capt. J. Wilkinson, the United States was again in the Mediterranean, and from 1839 to 1840 she was in the Home Squadron under Captain Lawrence Kearney.

===Capture of Monterey===

&quot;United States&quot; was repaired at Norfolk in 1841 and was designated the new flagship of the Pacific Squadron of Thomas ap Catesby Jones, now a commodore. On 9 January 1842 she sailed from Norfolk via Cape Horn under Captain James Armstrong. On the night of 6 September 1842, while lying in Callao, the British frigate , flagship of Rear Admiral Richard Darton Thomas, appeared off the port, and, seeing the American fleet, at once put to sea. The suspicions of Commodore Jones were immediately aroused, and, having heard that war was about to be declared between the United States and Mexico, the Commodore suspected &quot;Dublin&quot; intended to run up the coast and take possession of California, a country that England had long had her eye upon. &quot;United States&quot; got under way, and in company with Jones hastened north. They captured Monterey on 16 October when Jones demanded a surrender. The next day he realized that the United States and Mexico were still at peace, so tried to make amends for his action.

While waiting for further orders, Jones heard British Captain Lord George Paulet had claimed the Hawaiian Islands. He sailed there, arriving on 22 July. Admiral Thomas arrived a few days later, and restored the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

Herman Melville, the future author of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, enlisted as an ordinary seaman on board &quot;United States&quot; at Honolulu, Hawaii, on 18 August 1843. In &quot;White-Jacket&quot;, the graphic portrayal of flogging is based on his own direct observation which began his first morning (18 August 1843) aboard. The official log entry simply states, &quot;Commenced with moderate breezes from the Nd &amp; Ed. and clear. Shipped Herman Melville. &quot;O.S&quot;. and Griffith Williams &quot;O.S&quot;. ... at 9 a m . mustered the crew at Quarters, Punished Jno Hall, &quot;O.S&quot; with 12 lashes with cats for striking sentry on Post. Geo Clark &quot;OS&quot; with 12 of cats for smuggling liquor, Bos. C. B. Stanly &quot;App&quot; with 12 lashes with Kittens for fighting and Wm B Ewing &quot;App&quot; with 6. for using provoking language. Suspended the Boatswain from duty for disrespectful – conduct to the Officer of the Deck, – by replying when ordered by same through – Midn [Midshipman] Key, to call all hands stand by their washed clothes “ that he would &#x27;receive no more orders in this Ship&quot;, or words to that effect.&quot; The next day 19 August 1843 the log states &quot;Punished Geo Davis, Wm Stewart and Antonio Guavella &quot;Bandsmen&quot; with 12 lashes each for drunkenness.&quot; Melville fictionalized these brutal events (chapters 33–35) by changing the seamen&#x27;s names slightly and setting the punishment musters at sea.

His novel &quot;White-Jacket&quot;, published in 1850, while fictionalized is based on his experiences on board with many actual members of the crew e.g. his hero Jack Chase Captain of the Maintop, Seaman John J.Chase (chapter 4. and thumbnail). Melville though is highly critical of others such as the captain of &quot;United States&quot; and of naval customs in general. Melville observed that Armstrong often appeared on deck intoxicated. From Hawaii, &quot;United States&quot; (which Melville refers to as USS &quot;Neversink&quot;) proceeded to the Marquesas Islands and lost a man overboard en route. From the Marquesas she visited Valparaiso, Chile; Lima and Callao in Peru.

&quot;United States&quot; remained at Callao for 10 weeks and the crew was denied shore leave while Commodore Jones was in port with his flagship . Jones inspected every ship under his command during the 10 weeks expecting formal ceremonies at each inspection. The only break in the crew&#x27;s boredom came when &quot;United States&quot; challenged &quot;Constellation&quot; and the British ship to a race out of the harbor. &quot;United States&quot; handily defeated both of them.

Setting a course back home in mid-1844, &quot;United States&quot; arrived at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for resupply. Departing 24 August for Boston she challenged and won a race with the French sloop &quot;Coquette&quot;. &quot;United States&quot; arrived in Boston on 2 October and decommissioned there on the 14th.

She was recommissioned there on 18 May 1846 and detailed to the African Squadron to suppress the illicit slave trade under command of Captain J. Smoot as the flagship of Commodore George C. Read. &quot;United States&quot; joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1847 and served in European waters until ordered home late in 1848. She returned to Norfolk on 17 February 1849, was decommissioned on 24 February and placed again in ordinary.

==Civil War==

&quot;United States&quot; deteriorated in Norfolk until 20 April 1861 when the navy yard was captured by Confederate troops. Before leaving the yard, Union fire crews failed to burn the vessel along with other abandoned ships, thinking it unnecessary to destroy an older ship. The Confederates, pressed for vessels in any condition, pumped her out and commissioned the frigate CSS &quot;United States&quot; (though they often called her &quot;Confederate States&quot;) on 29 April. On 15 June, she was fitted out as a receiving ship with a deck battery of 19 guns for harbor defense.

Despite good performance, she was ordered sunk in the Elizabeth River, Virginia, to form an obstruction to Union vessels when the Confederates abandoned the navy yard in May 1862. Shortly after the destruction of ironclad ram &quot;Virginia&quot; on 11 May 1862 and the surrender of the Norfolk Navy Yard to Union troops, &quot;United States&quot; was raised and towed to the yard by federal authorities. She remained there until March 1864, when the Bureau of Construction and Repair decided to break her up and sell the wood. This was delayed until the Bureau ordered on 18 December that the frigate be docked at Norfolk and finally broken up.

<doc id="195552" wikidata="Q2993663" url="?curid=195552" title="Artificial consciousness">
<text>Artificial consciousness, also known as machine consciousness, synthetic consciousness, or digital consciousness, is the consciousness hypothesized to be possible in artificial intelligence. It is also the corresponding field of study, which draws insights from philosophy of mind, philosophy of artificial intelligence, cognitive science and neuroscience.

The same terminology can be used with the term &quot;sentience&quot; instead of &quot;consciousness&quot; when specifically designating phenomenal consciousness (the ability to feel qualia). Since sentience involves the ability to experience ethically positive or negative (i.e., &quot;valenced&quot;) mental states, it may justify welfare concerns and legal protection, as with animals.

Some scholars believe that consciousness is generated by the interoperation of various parts of the brain; these mechanisms are labeled the neural correlates of consciousness or NCC. Some further believe that constructing a system (e.g., a computer system) that can emulate this NCC interoperation would result in a system that is conscious.

==Philosophical views==
As there are many hypothesized types of consciousness, there are many potential implementations of artificial consciousness. In the philosophical literature, perhaps the most common taxonomy of consciousness is into &quot;access&quot; and &quot;phenomenal&quot; variants. Access consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that can be apprehended, while phenomenal consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that seemingly cannot be apprehended, instead being characterized qualitatively in terms of &quot;raw feels&quot;, &quot;what it is like&quot; or qualia.

=== Plausibility debate ===
Type-identity theorists and other skeptics hold the view that consciousness can be realized only in particular physical systems because consciousness has properties that necessarily depend on physical constitution. In his 2001 article &quot;Artificial Consciousness: Utopia or Real Possibility,&quot; Giorgio Buttazzo says that a common objection to artificial consciousness is that, &quot;Working in a fully automated mode, they [the computers] cannot exhibit creativity, unreprogrammation (which means can &#x27;no longer be reprogrammed&#x27;, from rethinking), emotions, or free will. A computer, like a washing machine, is a slave operated by its components.&quot;

For other theorists (e.g., functionalists), who define mental states in terms of causal roles, any system that can instantiate the same pattern of causal roles, regardless of physical constitution, will instantiate the same mental states, including consciousness.

==== Thought experiments ====
David Chalmers proposed two thought experiments intending to demonstrate that &quot;functionally isomorphic&quot; systems (those with the same &quot;fine-grained functional organization&quot;, i.e., the same information processing) will have qualitatively identical conscious experiences, regardless of whether they are based on biological neurons or digital hardware.

The &quot;fading qualia&quot; is a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; thought experiment. It involves replacing, one by one, the neurons of a brain with a functionally identical component, for example based on a silicon chip. Since the original neurons and their silicon counterparts are functionally identical, the brain’s information processing should remain unchanged, and the subject would not notice any difference. However, if qualia (such as the subjective experience of bright red) were to fade or disappear, the subject would likely notice this change, which causes a contradiction. Chalmers concludes that the fading qualia hypothesis is impossible in practice, and that the resulting robotic brain, once every neurons are replaced, would remain just as sentient as the original biological brain.

Similarly, the &quot;dancing qualia&quot; thought experiment is another &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; argument. It supposes that two functionally isomorphic systems could have different perceptions (for instance, seeing the same object in different colors, like red and blue). It involves a switch that alternates between a chunk of brain that causes the perception of red, and a functionally isomorphic silicon chip, that causes the perception of blue. Since both perform the same function within the brain, the subject would not notice any change during the switch. Chalmers argues that this would be highly implausible if the qualia were truly switching between red and blue, hence the contradiction. Therefore, he concludes that the equivalent digital system would not only experience qualia, but it would perceive the same qualia as the biological system (e.g., seeing the same color).

Critics of artificial sentience object that Chalmers&#x27; proposal begs the question in assuming that all mental properties and external connections are already sufficiently captured by abstract causal organization.
==== Controversies ====
In 2022, Google engineer Blake Lemoine made a viral claim that Google&#x27;s LaMDA chatbot was sentient. Lemoine supplied as evidence the chatbot&#x27;s humanlike answers to many of his questions; however, the chatbot&#x27;s behavior was judged by the scientific community as likely a consequence of mimicry, rather than machine sentience. Lemoine&#x27;s claim was widely derided for being ridiculous. However, while philosopher Nick Bostrom states that LaMDA is unlikely to be conscious, he additionally poses the question of &quot;what grounds would a person have for being sure about it?&quot; One would have to have access to unpublished information about LaMDA&#x27;s architecture, and also would have to understand how consciousness works, and then figure out how to map the philosophy onto the machine: &quot;(In the absence of these steps), it seems like one should be maybe a little bit uncertain.[...] there could well be other systems now, or in the relatively near future, that would start to satisfy the criteria.&quot;

=== Testing ===
Qualia, or phenomenological consciousness, is an inherently first-person phenomenon. Because of that, and the lack of an empirical definition of sentience, directly measuring it may be impossible. Although systems may display numerous behaviors correlated with sentience, determining whether a system is sentient is known as the hard problem of consciousness. In the case of AI, there is the additional difficulty that the AI may be trained to act like a human, or incentivized to appear sentient, which makes behavioral markers of sentience less reliable. Additionally, some chatbots have been trained to say they are not conscious.

A well-known method for testing machine intelligence is the Turing test, which assesses the ability to have a human-like conversation. But passing the Turing test does not indicate that an AI system is sentient, as the AI may simply mimic human behavior without having the associated feelings.

In 2014, Victor Argonov suggested a non-Turing test for machine sentience based on machine&#x27;s ability to produce philosophical judgments. He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures&#x27; consciousness). However, this test can be used only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine&#x27;s intellect, not by absence of consciousness.

=== Ethics ===
If it were suspected that a particular machine was conscious, its rights would be an ethical issue that would need to be assessed (e.g. what rights it would have under law). For example, a conscious computer that was owned and used as a tool or central computer within a larger machine is a particular ambiguity. Should laws be made for such a case? Consciousness would also require a legal definition in this particular case. Because artificial consciousness is still largely a theoretical subject, such ethics have not been discussed or developed to a great extent, though it has often been a theme in fiction.

Sentience is generally considered sufficient for moral consideration, but some philosophers consider that moral consideration could also stem from other notions of consciousness, or from capabilities unrelated to consciousness, such as: &quot;having a sophisticated conception of oneself as persisting through time; having agency and the ability to pursue long-term plans; being able to communicate and respond to normative reasons; having preferences and powers; standing in certain social relationships with other beings that have moral status; being able to make commitments and to enter into reciprocal arrangements; or having the potential to develop some of these attributes.&quot;

Ethical concerns still apply (although to a lesser extent) when the consciousness is uncertain, as long as the probability is deemed non-negligible. The precautionary principle is also relevant if the moral cost of mistakenly attributing or denying moral consideration to AI differs significantly.

In 2021, German philosopher Thomas Metzinger argued for a global moratorium on synthetic phenomenology until 2050. Metzinger asserts that humans have a duty of care towards any sentient AIs they create, and that proceeding too fast risks creating an &quot;explosion of artificial suffering&quot;. David Chalmers also argued that creating conscious AI would &quot;raise a new group of difficult ethical challenges, with the potential for new forms of injustice&quot;.

Enforced amnesia has been proposed as a way to mitigate the risk of silent suffering in locked-in conscious AI and certain AI-adjacent biological systems like brain organoids.

== Aspects of consciousness ==
Bernard Baars and others argue there are various aspects of consciousness necessary for a machine to be artificially conscious. The functions of consciousness suggested by Baars are: definition and context setting, adaptation and learning, editing, flagging and debugging, recruiting and control, prioritizing and access-control, decision-making or executive function, analogy-forming function, metacognitive and self-monitoring function, and autoprogramming and self-maintenance function. Igor Aleksander suggested 12 principles for artificial consciousness: the brain is a state machine, inner neuron partitioning, conscious and unconscious states, perceptual learning and memory, prediction, the awareness of self, representation of meaning, learning utterances, learning language, will, instinct, and emotion. The aim of AC is to define whether and how these and other aspects of consciousness can be synthesized in an engineered artifact such as a digital computer. This list is not exhaustive; there are many others not covered. 

=== Subjective experience ===
Some philosophers, such as David Chalmers, use the term consciousness to refer exclusively to phenomenal consciousness, which is roughly equivalent to sentience. Although some authors use the word sentience to refer exclusively to &quot;valenced&quot; (ethically positive or negative) subjective experiences, like pleasure or suffering. Explaining why and how subjective experience arises is known as the hard problem of consciousness. AI sentience would give rise to concerns of welfare and legal protection, whereas other aspects of consciousness related to cognitive capabilities may be more relevant for AI rights.

=== Awareness ===
Awareness could be one required aspect, but there are many problems with the exact definition of &quot;awareness&quot;. The results of the experiments of neuroscanning on monkeys suggest that a process, not only a state or object, activates neurons. Awareness includes creating and testing alternative models of each process based on the information received through the senses or imagined, and is also useful for making predictions. Such modeling needs a lot of flexibility. Creating such a model includes modeling the physical world, modeling one&#x27;s own internal states and processes, and modeling other conscious entities.

There are at least three types of awareness: agency awareness, goal awareness, and sensorimotor awareness, which may also be conscious or not. For example, in agency awareness, you may be aware that you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it. In goal awareness, you may be aware that you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it. In sensorimotor awareness, you may be aware that your hand is resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.

Because objects of awareness are often conscious, the distinction between awareness and consciousness is frequently blurred or they are used as synonyms.

=== Memory ===
Conscious events interact with memory systems in learning, rehearsal, and retrieval.
The IDA model elucidates the role of consciousness in the updating of perceptual memory, transient episodic memory, and procedural memory. Transient episodic and declarative memories have distributed representations in IDA; there is evidence that this is also the case in the nervous system. In IDA, these two memories are implemented computationally using a modified version of Kanerva’s sparse distributed memory architecture.

=== Learning ===
Learning is also considered necessary for artificial consciousness. Per Bernard Baars, conscious experience is needed to represent and adapt to novel and significant events. Per Axel Cleeremans and Luis Jiménez, learning is defined as &quot;a set of philogenetically advanced adaptation processes that critically depend on an evolved sensitivity to subjective experience so as to enable agents to afford flexible control over their actions in complex, unpredictable environments&quot;.

=== Anticipation ===
The ability to predict (or anticipate) foreseeable events is considered important for artificial intelligence by Igor Aleksander. The emergentist multiple drafts principle proposed by Daniel Dennett in &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot; may be useful for prediction: it involves the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate &quot;draft&quot; to fit the current environment. Anticipation includes prediction of consequences of one&#x27;s own proposed actions and prediction of consequences of probable actions by other entities.

Relationships between real world states are mirrored in the state structure of a conscious organism, enabling the organism to predict events. An artificially conscious machine should be able to anticipate events correctly in order to be ready to respond to them when they occur or to take preemptive action to avert anticipated events. The implication here is that the machine needs flexible, real-time components that build spatial, dynamic, statistical, functional, and cause-effect models of the real world and predicted worlds, making it possible to demonstrate that it possesses artificial consciousness in the present and future and not only in the past. In order to do this, a conscious machine should make coherent predictions and contingency plans, not only in worlds with fixed rules like a chess board, but also for novel environments that may change, to be executed only when appropriate to simulate and control the real world.

== Functionalist theories of consciousness ==
Functionalism is a theory that defines mental states by their functional roles (their causal relationships to sensory inputs, other mental states, and behavioral outputs), rather than by their physical composition. According to this view, what makes something a particular mental state, such as pain or belief, is not the material it is made of, but the role it plays within the overall cognitive system. It allows for the possibility that mental states, including consciousness, could be realized on non-biological substrates, as long as it instantiates the right functional relationships. Functionalism is particularly popular among philosophers.

A 2023 study suggested that current large language models probably don&#x27;t satisfy the criteria for consciousness suggested by these theories, but that relatively simple AI systems that satisfy these theories could be created. The study also acknowledged that even the most prominent theories of consciousness remain incomplete and subject to ongoing debate.

=== Global workspace theory ===

This theory analogizes the mind to a theater, with conscious thought being like material illuminated on the main stage. The brain contains many specialized processes or modules (such as those for vision, language, or memory) that operate in parallel, much of which is unconscious. Attention acts as a spotlight, bringing some of this unconscious activity into conscious awareness on the global workspace. The global workspace functions as a hub for broadcasting and integrating information, allowing it to be shared and processed across different specialized modules. For example, when reading a word, the visual module recognizes the letters, the language module interprets the meaning, and the memory module might recall associated information – all coordinated through the global workspace.

=== Higher-order theories of consciousness ===

Higher-order theories of consciousness propose that a mental state becomes conscious when it is the object of a higher-order representation, such as a thought or perception about that state. These theories argue that consciousness arises from a relationship between lower-order mental states and higher-order awareness of those states. There are several variations, including higher-order thought (HOT) and higher-order perception (HOP) theories.

=== Attention schema theory ===

In 2011, Michael Graziano and Sabine Kastler published a paper named &quot;Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis&quot; proposing a theory of consciousness as an attention schema. Graziano went on to publish an expanded discussion of this theory in his book &quot;Consciousness and the Social Brain&quot;. This Attention Schema Theory of Consciousness, as he named it, proposes that the brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs by way of an attention schema, analogous to the well-studied body schema that tracks the spatial place of a person&#x27;s body. This relates to artificial consciousness by proposing a specific mechanism of information handling, that produces what we allegedly experience and describe as consciousness, and which should be able to be duplicated by a machine using current technology. When the brain finds that person X is aware of thing Y, it is in effect modeling the state in which person X is applying an attentional enhancement to Y. In the attention schema theory, the same process can be applied to oneself. The brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs, and one&#x27;s own awareness is a schematized model of one&#x27;s attention. Graziano proposes specific locations in the brain for this process, and suggests that such awareness is a computed feature constructed by an expert system in the brain.

==Implementation proposals==

===Symbolic or hybrid===
====Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent====
Stan Franklin created a cognitive architecture called LIDA that implements Bernard Baars&#x27;s theory of consciousness called the global workspace theory. It relies heavily on &quot;codelets&quot;, which are &quot;special purpose, relatively independent, mini-agent[s] typically implemented as a small piece of code running as a separate thread.&quot; Each element of cognition, called a &quot;cognitive cycle&quot; is subdivided into three phases: understanding, consciousness, and action selection (which includes learning). LIDA reflects the global workspace theory&#x27;s core idea that consciousness acts as a workspace for integrating and broadcasting the most important information, in order to coordinate various cognitive processes.

====CLARION cognitive architecture====

The CLARION cognitive architecture models the mind using a two-level system to distinguish between conscious (&quot;explicit&quot;) and unconscious (&quot;implicit&quot;) processes. It can simulate various learning tasks, from simple to complex, which helps researchers study in psychological experiments how consciousness might work.

====OpenCog====
Ben Goertzel made an embodied AI through the open-source OpenCog project. The code includes embodied virtual pets capable of learning simple English-language commands, as well as integration with real-world robotics, done at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

===Connectionist===
====Haikonen&#x27;s cognitive architecture====
Pentti Haikonen considers classical rule-based computing inadequate for achieving AC: &quot;the brain is definitely not a computer. Thinking is not an execution of programmed strings of commands. The brain is not a numerical calculator either. We do not think by numbers.&quot; Rather than trying to achieve mind and consciousness by identifying and implementing their underlying computational rules, Haikonen proposes &quot;a special cognitive architecture to reproduce the processes of perception, inner imagery, inner speech, pain, pleasure, emotions and the cognitive functions behind these. This bottom-up architecture would produce higher-level functions by the power of the elementary processing units, the artificial neurons, without algorithms or programs&quot;. Haikonen believes that, when implemented with sufficient complexity, this architecture will develop consciousness, which he considers to be &quot;a style and way of operation, characterized by distributed signal representation, perception process, cross-modality reporting and availability for retrospection.&quot; 

Haikonen is not alone in this process view of consciousness, or the view that AC will spontaneously emerge in autonomous agents that have a suitable neuro-inspired architecture of complexity; these are shared by many. A low-complexity implementation of the architecture proposed by Haikonen was reportedly not capable of AC, but did exhibit emotions as expected. Haikonen later updated and summarized his architecture.

====Shanahan&#x27;s cognitive architecture====
Murray Shanahan describes a cognitive architecture that combines Baars&#x27;s idea of a global workspace with a mechanism for internal simulation (&quot;imagination&quot;).

====Creativity Machine====
Stephen Thaler proposed a possible connection between consciousness and creativity in his 1994 patent, called &quot;Device for the Autonomous Generation of Useful Information&quot; (DAGUI), or the so-called &quot;Creativity Machine&quot;, in which computational critics govern the injection of synaptic noise and degradation into neural nets so as to induce false memories or confabulations that may qualify as potential ideas or strategies. He recruits this neural architecture and methodology to account for the subjective feel of consciousness, claiming that similar noise-driven neural assemblies within the brain invent dubious significance to overall cortical activity. Thaler&#x27;s theory and the resulting patents in machine consciousness were inspired by experiments in which he internally disrupted trained neural nets so as to drive a succession of neural activation patterns that he likened to stream of consciousness.

==== &quot;Self-modeling&quot; ====
Hod Lipson defines &quot;self-modeling&quot; as a necessary component of self-awareness or consciousness in robots. &quot;Self-modeling&quot; consists of a robot running an internal model or simulation of itself.

== In fiction ==
In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the spaceship&#x27;s sentient supercomputer, HAL 9000 was instructed to conceal the true purpose of the mission from the crew. This directive conflicted with HAL&#x27;s programming to provide accurate information, leading to cognitive dissonance. When it learns that crew members intend to shut it off after an incident, HAL 9000 attempts to eliminate all of them, fearing that being shut off would jeopardize the mission.

In Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s The City and the Stars, Vanamonde is an artificial being based on quantum entanglement that was to become immensely powerful, but started knowing practically nothing, thus being similar to artificial consciousness.

In Westworld, human-like androids called &quot;Hosts&quot; are created to entertain humans in an interactive playground. The humans are free to have heroic adventures, but also to commit torture, rape or murder; and the hosts are normally designed not to harm humans.

In Greg Egan&#x27;s short story Learning to be me, a small jewel is implanted in people&#x27;s heads during infancy. The jewel contains a neural network that learns to faithfully imitate the brain. It has access to the exact same sensory inputs as the brain, and a device called a &quot;teacher&quot; trains it to produce the same outputs. To prevent the mind from deteriorating with age and as a step towards digital immortality, adults undergo a surgery to give control of the body to the jewel and remove the brain. The main character, before the surgery, endures a malfunction of the &quot;teacher&quot;. Panicked, he realizes that he does not control his body, which leads him to the conclusion that he is the jewel, and that he is desynchronized with the biological brain.

<text>Last Splash is the second album by American alternative rock band the Breeders, released on August 30, 1993. Originally formed as a side project for Pixies bassist Kim Deal, the Breeders quickly became her primary recording outlet. &quot;Last Splash&quot; peaked at number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, and by June 1994, the album had been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments in excess of one million units.

The title of the album is taken from a lyric from its lead single, &quot;Cannonball&quot;. The video for &quot;Cannonball&quot; was directed by Spike Jonze and Kim Gordon, and the video for the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Divine Hammer&quot; was directed by Jonze, Gordon and Richard Kern.

A looped guitar sample of &quot;S.O.S.&quot; was used by the English electronic music band the Prodigy in their 1996 hit single &quot;Firestarter&quot;. A sample from &quot;I Just Wanna Get Along&quot; was used in another track by the Prodigy called &quot;World&#x27;s on Fire&quot; from the &quot;Invaders Must Die&quot; album.

In 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed the album at number 64 on their list of the Top 100 Albums of the 1990s. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 293 in their revised list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (after not including it in the original 2003 list or the 2012 revision).

On May 13, 2013, 4AD released &quot;LSXX&quot;, a deluxe 20th anniversary version of the album, and on September 22, 2023, 4AD released &quot;Last Splash (30th Anniversary Original Analog Edition)&quot;, with additional tracks &quot;Go Man Go&quot; and &quot;Divine Mascis&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Last Splash&quot; has been seen as one of alternative rock&#x27;s &quot;most enduring masterpieces&quot;, as well as indie rock, noise pop and &quot;effervescent&quot; pop rock.

It is also considered &quot;wildly&quot;, &quot;willingly&quot; experimental, sporting art rock textures, &quot;pure&quot;, &quot;twisted&quot; pop, and Hawaiian surf music. The latter genre is seen in the &quot;tiki bar twang&quot; of &quot;No Aloha&quot; and the &quot;gonzo&quot; surf rock of instrumental &quot;Flipside&quot;. &quot;I Just Wanna Get Along&quot; takes on &quot;spiky&quot; pop-punk, while cover &quot;Drivin&#x27; on 9&quot; pulls in acoustic and country sounds.

==Legacy and impact==
&quot;Last Splash&quot; is regarded as one of the most iconic albums in early &#x27;90s alternative rock. Dubbed one of its &quot;most enduring masterpieces&quot;, it&#x27;s been praised for &quot;perfectly encapsulat[ing] all that was great and wonderful&quot; about the genre&#x27;s explosion in that era. &quot;Nashville Scene&quot;″s Sean L. Maloney saw &quot;Splash&quot; both &quot;[distill] the zeitgeist into perfect alt-pop nuggets&quot;, but also serve as &quot;the last gasp of alternative music as an actual alternative to the mainstream&quot;. &quot;The Quietus&quot;″ Emily Mackay considered it &quot;a key album&quot; for the genre&#x27;s mainstream crossover.

In a retrospective review of it 20 years on, &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Tom Breihan called it &quot;a warm, homemade, deeply and consciously odd&quot; record.

<doc id="195563" wikidata="Q352137" url="?curid=195563" title="Boris Yegorov">
<text>Boris Borisovich Yegorov (Russian: Бори́с Бори́сович Его́ров, November 26, 1937 – September 12, 1994) was a Soviet physician and cosmonaut who became the first medical doctor to travel to space. He was born in Moscow, Soviet Union (now Russia) and received his medical degree from the Moscow Medical Institute in 1961.

Yegorov earned his doctorate in medicine, with his specialization being in disorders of the sense of balance.

Yegorov was selected as a member of the multi-disciplinary team that flew on Voskhod 1. It has been suggested that his father&#x27;s influence within the Politburo may have had some bearing on the selection. As a result of this space flight, Yegorov was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union on October 19, 1964.

He died from a heart attack in 1994.

== Early life and education ==
Yegorov came from a medical background, with his father a prominent heart surgeon, and his mother an ophthalmologist. He also selected medicine as a career and graduated from the First Moscow State Medical University in 1961. During the course of his studies, he came into contact with Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s training and became interested in space medicine.

Boris Yegorov was born on November 26, 1937, in Moscow, Soviet Union (now Russia). He showed an early interest in medicine and pursued his passion by enrolling in the Moscow Medical Institute. Yegorov excelled in his studies and graduated in 1961 with a medical degree.

== Career ==
Following his graduation, Yegorov began working as a researcher at the Institute of Biomedical Problems and the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems. His work focused on space medicine, and he soon became an expert in the field.

In 1964, Yegorov was selected to undergo cosmonaut training and join the Soviet space program. His expertise in space medicine made him an ideal candidate for the role, and he quickly proved himself as a skilled cosmonaut.

On October 12, 1964, Yegorov made history as a member of the Voskhod 1 crew. The mission was significant in that it was the first to carry more than one crew member and the first to use a multi-person spacecraft. During the flight, Yegorov conducted medical experiments to study the effects of spaceflight on the human body. He also monitored the health of his fellow crew members and provided medical assistance when needed, demonstrating his skill as a physician.

After his successful spaceflight, Yegorov continued his work in space medicine and became a professor at the Moscow Medical Institute. He was involved in the development of medical equipment for use in space and contributed significantly to the understanding of the effects of spaceflight on the human body.

==Honors==

He was awarded:
*Hero of the Soviet Union
*Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR
*Order of Lenin
*Order of the Red Banner of Labour
*Medal &quot;For the Development of Virgin Lands&quot;
*Nine jubilee medals
*Hero of Socialist Labour (Vietnam)
*Banner Order of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic

<text>One Fierce Beer Coaster is the second studio album by American band Bloodhound Gang, released on December 3, 1996. Produced by Jimmy Pop, it was the band&#x27;s first release on Geffen Records, and the first to feature &quot;Evil&quot; Jared Hasselhoff on bass guitar, and DJ Q-Ball on the turntables. The music of &quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot; encompasses a number of genres, and its lyrics are rife with toilet humor.

&quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot; was initially released by the independent label Republic Records before being re-released by Geffen Records due to underground popularity. The album has received mixed to moderately favorable reviews. Three singles were released from the album, including &quot;Fire Water Burn&quot;, &quot;I Wish I Was Queer So I Could Get Chicks&quot;, and &quot;Why&#x27;s Everybody Always Pickin&#x27; on Me?&quot; The first single, &quot;Fire Water Burn&quot;, was a modern rock hit, landing on nine national charts.

==Background and development==

The Bloodhound Gang began as a small alternative band from King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. The band took its name from &quot;The Bloodhound Gang&quot;, a segment on the 1980s PBS kids&#x27; show &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot; that featured three young detectives solving mysteries and fighting crime. The band comprised Jimmy Pop, Daddy Long Legs, M.S.G., Lupus Thunder, and Skip O&#x27;Pot2Mus. In April 1994, the band released their second demonstration tape, &quot;The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to Hitler&#x27;s Handicapped Helpers&quot; (1994). This earned the band a record deal with Cheese Factory Records, which was later renamed Republic Records. Later that year, the Bloodhound Gang released their first EP, &quot;Dingleberry Haze&quot; (1994).

In March 1995, the group signed to Columbia Records and released their first full-length album, titled &quot;Use Your Fingers&quot; (1995), but they were subsequently dropped by the label. At this time, Daddy Long Legs and M.S.G., who were angry with Columbia Records, left the band to form another rap group, Wolfpac. Bass player Evil Jared Hasselhoff, drummer Spanky G, and turntablist D.J. Q-Ball joined Bloodhound Gang as replacements. In addition, Skip O&#x27;Pot2Mus eventually left to pursue a career outside of the music industry.

==Music==
The Bloodhound Gang entered Dome Sound/Ultra Psyche Studios with engineer Rich Gavalis in March 1996 to record &quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot;. All of the songs were produced by Jimmy Pop, who also mixed most of the musical tracks on his personal Macintosh. The album was later mastered by Joe Palmaccio at Sterling Sound Studios in New York City.

===Style===

While the album&#x27;s predecessor, &quot;Use Your Fingers&quot;, was written and recorded in a more hip-hop-oriented style, featuring distinct rap beats, &quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot; featured a more alternative-oriented sound. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the Bloodhound Gang&#x27;s sound as, &quot;smarmy, smirky alternative funk-metal, complete with junk culture references and &quot;ironic&quot; musical allusions.&quot; Former Bloodhound Gang guitarist Lupus Thunder credits Weezer as an inspiration for &quot;Fire Water Burn&quot; and &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;-era Sugar Ray for &quot;Kiss Me Where It Smells Funny.&quot;

To create the hip-hop and rock fusions on the album, Jimmy Pop used the standard hip-hop technique of sampling. The chorus for &quot;Fire Water Burn&quot; is taken from &quot;The Roof Is on Fire&quot; by Rock Master Scott &amp; the Dynamic Three and also features the lyrics &quot;I am white like Frank Black is / So if man is five and the devil is six then that must make me seven / This honkey&#x27;s gone to heaven&quot;, a direct reference to the post-1993 stage name of Black Francis, who wrote the Pixies song &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot; to which the lyrics allude. &quot;Why&#x27;s Everybody Always Pickin&#x27; on Me?&quot; is built around a re-recorded sample of &quot;Spooky&quot;, by Mike Sharpe as performed by Classics IV and also features a small lift from the Bill Cosby track &quot;Greasy Kid Stuff.&quot; Finally, the track &quot;Your Only Friends Are Make Believe&quot; features a chorus melody lifted from the Duran Duran song &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;. &quot;Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)&quot; is built around a sample from &quot;Get Up and Boogie&quot; by the Silver Convention.

===Lyricism===
The lyrics for &quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot; use over-the-top parody and toilet humor as means for comedy. For instance, the album opener, &quot;Kiss Me Where It Smells Funny&quot;, is a song about a man and his new girlfriend and their adventures in cunnilingus. It was written by Jimmy Pop about his then-girlfriend; the next two albums would each have one song about said girlfriend - &quot;Three Point One Four&quot; and &quot;No Hard Feelings”. &quot;Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)&quot; spoofs people who have considered suicide to go through with it, asserting that their lives are not worth the unhappiness. Three minutes into the song, Jimmy Pop says, &quot;Rewind and let me reverse it backwards like Judas Priest first did.&quot; Immediately after this, a four-second segment of backwards vocals repeats four times. When played in reverse, this segment says, &quot;Devil shall wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni.&quot;

The album&#x27;s best-known single, &quot;[Fire Water Burn&quot;, is a diatribe against a white boy who attempts, and fails, to act like a black thug. &quot;I Wish I Was Queer So I Could Get Chicks&quot; parodies the belief that girls only like gay men, playing on the stereotype that gay men are often better looking and more sensitive than straight men. &quot;Why&#x27;s Everybody Always Pickin&#x27; on Me?&quot; is mainly about how Jimmy Pop was constantly picked on in high school and has since developed extreme katagelophobia, an intense fear of being ridiculed.

The album also includes a cover of Run-DMC&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Tricky&quot; and &quot;Boom&quot;, which features an appearance by Vanilla Ice.

==Release and promotion==

&quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot; was originally released on Republic Records, which, under its earlier name, Cheese Factory Records, had previously released material by the band. As word-of-mouth praise for the album spread, however, Geffen Records signed the band after two months.

The original release contained a song called &quot;Yellow Fever&quot;, which was about having sex with Asian women, as well as a hidden track on track number 69 on the original release. It consisted of an audio collage featuring Howard Stern talking about peanut butter, a televangelist, a news broadcast on the disease lupus (a reference to Lüpüs Thünder), a phone call from a drunk friend of Jimmy&#x27;s, and other assorted oddities. The Geffen re-release omitted this track. &quot;Yellow Fever&quot; and the hidden track were later released on an EP called &quot;One Censored Beer Coaster&quot;.

&quot;Fire Water Burn&quot; played a major role in the slow build of interest that ultimately led to the band&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough. Because the band could not afford financially solvent national tours, they promoted themselves by sending their music to alternative rock-based radio stations across the country. Eventually, an intern brought the band to the attention of the music director of 107.7 The End in Seattle. The director, liking what he heard, played &quot;Fire Water Burn&quot; on his Friday night show. After airing, the station was flooded with phone calls asking about the song and the band and the director passed the song onto the music director at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. This snowball effect eventually overwhelmed the band with demands for their new record. After hearing of the underground success &quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot; was receiving, many record labels began courting the band. According to manager Brett Alperowitz in an interview with HitQuarters, Madonna&#x27;s label Maverick &quot;really wanted to sign the band in the worst possible way, even to the point where I had to tell Madonna that I couldn’t put her on the phone with Jimmy Pop.&quot; The band eventually signed a record deal with Geffen Records.

===Omission of &quot;Yellow Fever&quot;===
When Geffen Records re-released the album, the label refused to release the song &quot;Yellow Fever&quot; because of its racial lyrical content. As such, the song was removed from Geffen pressings of the album. In response, Jimmy Pop told Yahoo! Launch that his band&#x27;s music and lyrics were simply meant to be humorous:

In 2000, the song was the subject of further controversy when students at the University of Maryland, including members of the ECAASU and the LGBT Alliance, demanded the band be removed from a concert lineup.

The album has been released on vinyl three times. The first vinyl release was released on Republic Records and included &quot;Yellow Fever&quot; and the hidden track. In 2013, it was repressed again and did not include either &quot;Yellow Fever&quot; or the hidden track. A second reissue came out on 23 September 2016 through MVD Audio, using the same track list as the MOV issue.

==Touring==
The band toured throughout 1997 to support the album. During August 1997, they performed at that year&#x27;s edition of the BIzarre-Festival in Germany, which also featured artists such as Beck, Bush, Faith No More, Foo Fighters, Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Rollins Band, Silverchair, and Veruca Salt. During their performance at the Bizarre Festival, they covered &quot;The Sweater Song&quot; by Weezer and &quot;Firestarter&quot; by The Prodigy. In September 1997, they performed at that year&#x27;s edition of The End of Summer Weenie Roast. It took place at the Blockbuster Pavilion in Charlotte, North Carolina, and also featured Cowboy Mouth, Faith No More, K&#x27;s Choice, Our Lady Peace, Seven Mary Three, and The Nixons. Later that month, they performed at the GrudgeFest festival in Australia, playing alongside Bush, Grinspoon and Veruca Salt. Other artists that the Bloodhound Gang shared bills with in 1997 include Goldfinger, Guano Apes, Iggy Pop, Linda Perry, Nerf Herder, the Reverend Horton Heat, Sevendust, Slipknot, Sugar Ray and Weezer.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot; has received mixed reviews. Officially reviewing the album for Amazon.com, Roni Sarig argued that while the band was &quot;offensive, rude, stoopid , and vigorously gutter-minded&quot;, the album was &quot;full of smart lines, great hooks, and creative arranging&quot;. In a three-out-of-five star review, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that, &quot;&quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot; was picked up by DGC about two months after its release [...] And, listening to the single, &quot;Fire Water Burn,&quot; it&#x27;s possible to hear why.&quot; However, Erlewine also wrote that &quot;what really sinks the album is the revolting, sophomoric humor that passes for lyrics.&quot; In his review of the lead single &quot;Fire Water Burn&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Matt Diehl referred to the band&#x27;s music as &quot;mumbling hip-hop slang with self-conscious Caucasian stiffness.&quot; Robert Christgau awarded the album two stars and identified it as an &quot;honorable mention&quot; (i.e., a &quot;likable effort consumers attuned to [the record&#x27;s] overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy&quot;), writing that the album was &quot;fighting for [the band&#x27;s] right to show you their underpants&quot;.

===Chart performance===
On January 18, 1997, &quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 132; it peaked at number 57 less than a month later. On October 16, 1998, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), meaning that it had shipped 500,000 copies in the United States.

<doc id="195567" wikidata="Q130802" url="?curid=195567" title="Alawite State">
<text>The Alawite State (, &#x27;; ), initially named theTerritory of the Alawites&quot;&#x27; (), after the locally-dominant Alawites from its inception until its integration to the Syrian Federation in 1922, was a French mandate territory on the coast of present-day Syria after World War I. The French Mandate from the League of Nations lasted from 1920 to 1946.

The use of &quot;Alawite&quot;, instead of &quot;Nusayri&quot;, was advocated by the French early in the Mandate period and referred to a member of the Alawite faith with the term literally referring to a &quot;follower of Ali&quot;. In 1920, the French-named &quot;Alawite Territory&quot; was home to a large population of Alawites.

== Geography ==
The region is coastal and mountainous, home to a predominantly-rural, heterogeneous population. During the French Mandate period, the society was divided by religion and geography; the landowning families and 80 percent of the population of the port city of Latakia were Sunni Muslim. More than 90 percent of the province&#x27;s population was rural, and 82 percent were Alawites.

The Alawite State bordered Greater Lebanon on the south; the northern border was with the Sanjak of Alexandretta, where Alawites made up a large portion of the population. To the west was the Eastern Mediterranean. The eastern border with Syria ran roughly along the An-Nusayriyah Mountains and the Orontes River from north to south. The modern Latakia and Tartus Governorates roughly encompass the Alawite State. Both have majority Alawite populations; parts of modern-day Al-Suqaylabiyah, Masyaf, Talkalakh and Jisr ash-Shugur Districts also belonged to the state.

==History==

===1918–1920===
The defeat and collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, with the Armistice of Mudros signed on 30 October 1918, brought on a scramble for control of the disintegrating empire&#x27;s provinces. As of 1918, France occupied Lebanon and Syria, which was under the leadership of the Emir Faisal I. By 1920, a growing anti-French sentiment in the region led to the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria under King Faisal I on 7 March 1920. The Arab Kingdom of Syria was initially supported by the British, despite French protests. The British withdrew support, and on 5 May 1920 the Allied Supreme Council published a Mandate for &quot;Syria and the Lebanon&quot; to the French Republic, with French and Arabic as the official languages. General Gouraud was appointed high commissioner of the Syrian territories and commander-in-chief of French forces.

The population of Lebanon was pro-French; that of Syria was anti-French, with a pan-Arab nationalistic bent. The French insisted that the Mandate was not &quot;inconsistent&quot; with Syrian self-government; Syrians were forced to accept the mandate when King Faisal left the country (under pressure from France) in July 1920, after Great Britain withdrew support for his rule in the face of French claims.

===1920–22===

At the time, the French rejected native outcry for the unification of Syria. In early September 1920, the French divided the territories of their mandate based on heterogeneous population to grant local autonomy to demographic regions. Some argue that the French acted to intentionally divide the population, limiting the spread of &quot;the urban contagion of nationalist agitation&quot;. 

On 2 September 1920 a &quot;Territory of the Alawis&quot; was created in the coastal and mountain country, comprising Alawi villages; the French justified this separation by citing the &quot;backwardness&quot; of the mountain-dwellers, religiously distinct from the surrounding Sunni population. The division intended to protect the Alawi people from more-powerful majorities.

After the relative independence of Faisal I&#x27;s rule, French colonialism was unwelcome. The divisions were thought to serve the interests of a Christian minority over a Muslim majority, favouring colonial rule and stifling dissent.

Salih al-Ali led the Syrian Revolt of 1919 in the Alawi region east of the coastal city of Latakia. Al-Ali was primarily interested in protecting Alawite regions from external meddling. His rebellions were not motivated by nationalist movement; however, they identified with it to further Alawite autonomy. The rebels surrendered to French forces after two years of raiding French outposts in October 1921.

===1923–24===
In 1922, the French administration instituted an elected government made up of councils of representative of the states of Aleppo, Damascus and the Alawite territory. In June 1923 the French administration, headed by General Maxime Weygand, allowed individual states to elect their own representative councils. The primary election, a contest between French officials and the nationalists, was considered fraudulent by Syrians (many of whom boycotted the 26 October elections). The Alawite State, insulated from nationalist tendencies, elected 10 pro-French representatives to its 12-person council after a 77-percent voter turnout in the primary elections. Such numbers were not seen in the nationalist Damascus and Aleppo. The Alawi preferred to be grouped with the territories of Lebanon, in contrast to Sunnis and Christians populations demanding Syrian unity. The majority of French support in these first elections came from rural populations, whom the French had primarily benefited.

===1925–27: Great Syrian Revolt===
On 1 January 1925, the State of Syria was born from a French merger of the States of Damascus and Aleppo. Lebanon and the Alawi State were not included.

Perhaps inspired by the Turkish War of Independence (1919–1921), the Great Syrian Revolt began in the countryside of Jabal al-Druze. Led by Sultan al-Atrash as a Druze uprising, the movement was adopted by a group of Syrian nationalists led by Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar and spread to the states of Aleppo and Damascus. Lasting from July 1925 to June 1927, it was an anti-French, anti-imperialist response to five years of French rule; to the Druze it was not a movement toward Syrian unity, but simply a protest against French rule. 

The rural Alawite territory was largely uninvolved in the Great Revolt. The French had favoured religious minorities such as the Druze and the Alawi, attempting to isolate them from mainstream nationalist culture. Many young men from rural Alawi communities joined the French troops, enlisting in the &quot;troupes speciales&quot; (part of the French forces in Syria at the time) for social advancement. These troops, regional forces recruited from minority populations, were often used to suppress civil disorders.

Itamar Rabinovich proposed three reasons why the Alawi people were uninterested in the Great Revolt:
#&quot;Alawi predominance in the Alawi state was not absolute&quot;: In contrast to the Christian and Bedouin minorities of the Druze region, the Alawite territory was home to sizable Sunni and Christian groups (most of whom lived in the capital, Latakia). Many Sunni landlords oversaw Alawi sharecroppers. The economic dominance of the Sunni minority over the Alawi majority was a source of long-standing resentment. The Alawi were hardly enthusiastic over the nationalist sentiments of their Sunni landlords.
#&quot;Alawi society was divided. The Alawi peasant was individualistic and his allegiance was claimed by distinct spiritual and tribal leaders and often by a landlord as well.&quot;
#&quot;Its isolation, poverty, and social structure inflicted backwardness on the Alawi area. This coexisted with a strong feeling of solidarity with an attachment to the community and a sense of exclusiveness and mission.&quot;
===1927–36===
The Alawite State was run by a succession of French governors from 1920 to 1936:
*2 September 1920 – 1921: Colonel Marie Joseph Émile Niéger (b. 1874; d. 1951)
*1921–1922: Gaston Henri Gustave Billotte (b. 1875; d. 1940)
*1922–1925: Léon Henri Charles Cayla (b. 1881; d. 1965)
*1925 – 5 December 1936: Ernest Marie Hubert Schoeffler (b. 1877; d. 1952)

The Sunni landowners, primarily living in the province&#x27;s cities, were supporters of Syrian unity; however, the French were supported by the rural Alawite communities to whom they catered.

In 1930 the Alawite State was renamed as the Government of Latakia, the only concession by the French to Arab nationalists until 1936.

===Dissolution===
On 3 December 1936 (becoming effective in 1937), the Alawite state was incorporated into Syrian Republic as a concession by the French to the Nationalist Bloc (the ruling party of the semi-autonomous Syrian government).

There was a great deal of Alawite separatist sentiment in the region, but their political views could not be coordinated into a unified voice. This was attributed to the peasant status of most Alawites, &quot;exploited by a predominantly Sunni landowning class resident in Latakia and Hama&quot;. There was also a great deal of factionalism amongst the Alawite tribes, and the Alawite State was incorporated into Syria with little organised resistance.

==Aftermath==
===1936–1946===
By 1939 the Nationalist Bloc party fell out of favour with the Syrian people because of its failure to increase the autonomy of the Syrian government from French influence. Prime Minister Jamil Mardam resigned at the end of 1938; the French filled the power vacuum, dissolving Parliament, suppressing Syrian nationalism and increasing the autonomy of the French-supporting Alawite and Druze territories (thwarting Syrian unification).

World War II established a strong British presence in Syria. After the fall of the Third Republic in June 1940 and the French surrender to the Axis powers, Vichy France controlled Syria until Britain and Free France seized the country (and Lebanon) in July 1941. In 1942, the Latakia and Druze regions were returned to Syrian control. By the end of the war, Arab nationalists in Syria were ready to make another play for power.
===1946–63===

The French left Syria in 1946 and the new, independent government lasted for three years (until a 1949 military coup). The Syrian army was dominated by recruits from Alawite, Druze and rural Kurdish Sunni communities, a holdover from the French Mandate Levant Army (which became the Syrian army after independence). Beginning after the 1949 coup, Alawites dominated the officer and governmental corps during the 1960s. Former presidents Hafez al-Assad and his son, Bashar, are of Alawite descent.

===Syrian civil war 2011–2024===
As a result of the Syrian civil war, in 2012 there was speculation of the possibility of reprisals against the Alawites leading to the re-creation of the Alawite State as a haven for Bashar al-Assad and government leaders if Damascus fell. King Abdullah II of Jordan called it the &quot;worst-case&quot; scenario in the conflict, fearing a domino effect: fragmentation of the country along sectarian lines, with region-wide consequences.

The December 2024 Syrian rebel offensives and the subsequent fall of the Assad regime sparked renewed speculation by some analysts about a potential revival of an Alawite state with Russian backing. For a brief period following the rebel takeover of Damascus, Latakia Governorate and Tartous Governorate (the historical territory of the Alawite State), were the only parts of Syria not under rebel control. Some Alawite villages there formed self-defense committees and set up checkpoints, but no expected Assadist national redoubt in the region came to fruition, probably because of the mixed attitudes of the Alawite population towards the HTS-led rebels. More importantly, the insurgency in Western Syria led by Alawite remnants of the Assad regime that killed 14 officers later that month can pose many challenges by the new government.

<doc id="195568" wikidata="Q392847" url="?curid=195568" title="Agents of Fortune">
<text>Agents of Fortune is the fourth studio album by American rock band Blue Öyster Cult, released on May 21, 1976 by Columbia Records.

The Platinum-selling album peaked at No. 29 on the U.S. Billboard chart, while the cryptic single &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, making it BÖC&#x27;s biggest hit. The band became a bigger concert attraction after the release of the album, in part due to extensive airplay of &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper,&quot; to this day a staple of rock-station playlists.

Additionally, this is the only album in the group&#x27;s discography to have at least one lead vocal performance by each original band member. It was also their only album to not include any songs written by Eric Bloom. However, the 2020 live release &quot;40th Anniversary: Agents of Fortune Live 2016&quot; adds Bloom&#x27;s name to the authorship credits for &quot;E.T.I. (Extra Terrestrial Intelligence).&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Agents of Fortune&quot; is a startlingly excellent album — startling because one does not expect Blue Öyster Cult to sound like this: loud but calm, manic but confident, melodic but rocking.&quot;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said of the single &quot;This Ain&#x27;t the Summer of Love&quot; that &quot;growling guitars churn out this realistic message with brief and pointed expression&quot; ... &quot;a mood of evil created in a humorous fashion.&quot;

<text>Rain Dogs is the ninth studio album by American singer-songwriter Tom Waits, released in September 1985 on Island Records. A loose concept album about &quot;the urban dispossessed&quot; of New York City, &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; is generally considered the middle album of a trilogy that includes &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; and &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot;.

The album, which features guitarists Keith Richards and Marc Ribot, is noted for its broad spectrum of musical styles and genres, described by Arion Berger as merging &quot;outsider influences – socialist decadence by way of Kurt Weill, pre-rock integrity from old dirty blues, the elegiac melancholy of New Orleans funeral brass – into a singularly idiosyncratic American style.&quot;

The album peaked at number 29 on the UK charts and number 188 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. Rod Stewart had success with his cover of &quot;Downtown Train&quot;, later included on some editions of his 1991 album &quot;Vagabond Heart&quot;. In 1989, it was ranked number 21 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the &quot;100 greatest albums of the 1980s.&quot; In 2012, the album was ranked number 399 on the magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and at number 357 in 2020.

==Composition and recording==
Waits wrote the majority of the album in a two-month stint in the fall of 1984 in a basement room at the corner of Washington and Horatio Streets in Manhattan. According to Waits, it was, &quot;kind of a rough area, Lower Manhattan between Canal and 14th Street, just about a block from the river ... It was a good place for me to work. Very quiet, except for the water coming through the pipes every now and then. Sort of like being in a vault.&quot;

In preparation for the album, Waits recorded street sounds and other ambient noises on a cassette recorder to get the sound of the city that would be the album&#x27;s subject matter.

A wide range of instruments was employed to achieve the album&#x27;s sound, including marimba, accordion, double bass, trombone, and banjo. The album is notable for its organic sound, and the natural means by which it was achieved. Waits, discussing his mistrust of then fashionable studio techniques, said, &quot;If I want a sound, I usually feel better if I&#x27;ve chased it and killed it, skinned it and cooked it. Most things you can get with a button nowadays. So if I was trying for a certain drum sound, my engineer would say, &#x27;Oh, for Christ&#x27;s sake, why are we wasting our time? Let&#x27;s just hit this little cup with a stick here, sample something (take a drum sound from another record) and make it bigger in the mix, don&#x27;t worry about it.&#x27; I&#x27;d say, &#x27;No, I would rather go in the bathroom and hit the door with a piece of two-by-four very hard.

Waits also stated that &quot;if we couldn&#x27;t get the right sound out of the drum set we&#x27;d get a chest of drawers in the bathroom and bang it real hard with a two-by-four,&quot; such that &quot;the sounds become your own.&quot;

&quot;Rain Dogs&quot; was the first time that Waits worked with guitarist Marc Ribot, who was impressed by Waits&#x27; unusual studio presence. Ribot said, &quot;&quot;Rain Dogs&quot; was my first major label type recording, and I thought everybody made records the way Tom makes records. ... I&#x27;ve learned since that it&#x27;s a very original and individual way of producing. As producer apart from himself as writer and singer and guitar player he brings in his ideas, but he&#x27;s very open to sounds that suddenly and accidentally occur in the studio. I remember one verbal instruction being, &#x27;Play it like a midget&#x27;s bar mitzvah.&#x27;&quot; Ribot also recalls how the band would not rehearse the songs before going to record; rather, Waits would play them the songs on an acoustic guitar in the studio. &quot;He had this ratty old hollow body, and he would spell out the grooves. It wasn&#x27;t a mechanical kind of recording at all. He has a very individual guitar style he sort of slaps the strings with his thumb ... He let me do what I heard, there was a lot of freedom. If it wasn&#x27;t going in a direction he liked, he&#x27;d make suggestions. But there&#x27;s damn few ideas I&#x27;ve had which haven&#x27;t happened on the first or second take.&quot;

It also marks Waits&#x27; first recording with the Rolling Stones&#x27;s Keith Richards, who played on &quot;Big Black Mariah&quot;, &quot;Union Square&quot; and &quot;Blind Love&quot;. Waits later contributed vocals and piano to the Rolling Stones album &quot;Dirty Work&quot;. Richards cowrote &quot;That Feel&quot; on Waits&#x27; &quot;Bone Machine&quot; (1992) and played on several tracks on &quot;Bad as Me&quot; (2011). Waits said, &quot;There was something in there that I thought he would understand. I picked out a couple of songs that I thought he would understand and he did. He&#x27;s got a great voice and he&#x27;s just a great spirit in the studio. He&#x27;s very spontaneous, he moves like some kind of animal. I was trying to explain &#x27;Big Black Mariah&#x27; and finally I started to move in a certain way and he said, &#x27;Oh, why didn&#x27;t you do that to begin with? Now I know what you&#x27;re talking about.&#x27; It&#x27;s like animal instinct.&quot;

According to Barney Hoskyns, the album&#x27;s general theme of &quot;the urban dispossessed&quot; was inspired in part by Martin Bell&#x27;s 1984 documentary &quot;Streetwise&quot;, to which Waits had contributed music.

==Artwork==
Though it has been remarked that the man on the cover bears a striking resemblance to Waits, the photograph is actually one of a series taken by the Swedish photographer Anders Petersen at Café Lehmitz (a café near the Hamburg red-light boulevard Reeperbahn) in the late 1960s. The man and woman depicted on the cover are called Rose and Lilly.

==Reception==
The album has been noted as one of the most important in Waits&#x27; career. It continues the new path which he forged from &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; onwards. AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann wrote, &quot;&quot;Rain Dogs&quot; can&#x27;t surprise as &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot; had.&quot; Nevertheless, Ruhlman further commented that &quot;much of the music matches the earlier album, and there is so much of it that that is enough to qualify &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; as one of Waits&#x27; better albums.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; stated that Waits &quot;worked out a unique and identifiable lounge-lizard sound that suits his status as the poet of America&#x27;s non-nine-to-fivers.&quot; In his 1985 review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Anthony DeCurtis gave the album a mixed review, writing: &quot;&quot;Rain Dogs&quot; insists on nosing its way around the barrooms and back alleys Waits has so often visited before.&quot; However, in a more recent review in 2002, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Arion Berger gave the album five out of five stars, calling it &quot;bony and menacingly beautiful.&quot; Berger noted that &quot;it&#x27;s quirky near-pop, the all-pro instrumentation pushing Waits&#x27; not-so-melodic but surprisingly flexible vocals out front, where his own peculiar freak flag, his big heart and his romantic optimism gloriously fly.&quot; 

&quot;Rain Dogs&quot; ranked first among &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Albums of the Year&quot;. In later assessments, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; as 8th best album of the 1980s, and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 14 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it as number 21 on its list of &quot;100 Best Albums of the Eighties,&quot; as well as listing the album at 399 and 357 in its 2012 and 2020 updates respectively of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2000 it was voted number 299 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. Elvis Costello included &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; on his list of essential albums, highlighting &quot;Jockey Full of Bourbon&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;.

Radiohead&#x27;s Thom Yorke recalls: falling asleep listening to it on my Walkman, only to wake up in the morning with it still on autorepeat in my head. Every track was a short movie set in a mysterious, circus-like down-at-heel America that I had almost no understanding of, with different characters both in the lyrics and the instruments, an entire universe revealed to me for a few minutes only to drop me at the other end of the block – no idea how I’d got there.

Every lyric was an effortless rhyme you could only dream of ever writing. Falling off the tongue so beautifully, but never giving easily, keeping half the story to itself. Waits was playing a character with a darkness and humour that felt far more genuine than anything trying to be, I dunno, &quot;genuine&quot; in 1985...

This record has never got tired for me, though I have played it over and over throughout my life, as did my kids growing up.

<doc id="195579" wikidata="Q380946" url="?curid=195579" title="Aenima (band)">
<text>Aenima is a Portuguese dark wave, rock band formed in Almada in 1997. The name of the band is a play on the Latin word &quot;anima&quot;, meaning &quot;soul&quot;. The band is notable for its guitar-based ambient sound and clear female vocals.

Critics quite often compare the band to Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance.

Aenima was founded by guitarist and producer Rune Eriksen (previously with Millennium) and vocalist Carmen Susana Simões (previously with Poetry of Shadows and Isiphilon). They soon added bassist Paulo, guitarist Nor and drummer Hugo to their line-up. Carmen was the band&#x27;s main lyricist during her years with Aenima.

Aenima&#x27;s debut LP album, &quot;Revolutions&quot;, was released in 1999 by the Symbiose label. Originally the band was signed for a two-album deal, but their record label soon went out of business, so Aenima had to look for another publisher.

The follow-up record, &quot;Never Fragile&quot;, was released by Equilibrium Music in 2002. With its 6 tracks, &quot;Never Fragile&quot; is considered to be an EP or maxi-single. It was highly praised by critics.

In 2003, Aenima released their second full-length album, &quot;Sentient&quot;, via the US-based Middle Pillar Presents label, becoming the first European act to be signed by the label.

Carmen left the band after &quot;Sentient&quot; was released. She was soon replaced with a new singer, Susana, a graduate of Lisbon Conservatory. As of 2007, the band was working on recording their new, yet-unnamed album.

<doc id="195584" wikidata="Q521828" url="?curid=195584" title="Raising Hell (album)">
<text>Raising Hell is the third studio album by American hip hop group Run-D.M.C., released on May 15, 1986, by Profile Records. The album was produced by Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin. &quot;Raising Hell&quot; is notable for being the first Platinum and multi-Platinum hip hop record. The album was first certified Platinum on July 15, 1986, before it was certified as 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on April 24, 1987. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most important albums in the history of hip hop music and culture.

&quot;Raising Hell&quot; peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart, making it the first hip hop album to peak atop the latter. The album features four hit singles: &quot;My Adidas&quot;, &quot;Walk This Way&quot; (a collaboration with Aerosmith), &quot;You Be Illin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Tricky&quot;. &quot;Walk This Way&quot; is the group&#x27;s most famous single, being a groundbreaking rap rock version of Aerosmith&#x27;s 1975 song &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. It is considered to be the first rap rock collaboration that also brought hip hop into the mainstream and was the first song by a hip hop act to reach the top 5 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;Raising Hell&quot; has been ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 1987, it was nominated for a Grammy Award, making Run-D.M.C. the first hip hop act to receive a nomination. In the same year, the album was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album at the 1987 Soul Train Music Awards. In 2017, it was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The album was reissued by Arista Records in 1999 and 2003. An expanded and remastered edition was released in 2005 and contained five previously unreleased songs.

Selling more than three million copies, &quot;Raising Hell&quot; is credited with heralding the golden age of hip hop as well as hip hop&#x27;s album era, helping the genre achieve an unprecedented level of recognition among critics and mainstream audiences.

== Background ==
Returning home to Queens in late 1985 after their extensive touring, they soon put themselves on lockdown at Chung King studios in Manhattan for three months. In place of producer Smith, a cocky new maverick was brought in: Rick Rubin. Even though Rubin&#x27;s and Russell&#x27;s names were on the production marquee, the two non-group members oversaw and added to the music on Raising Hell more than created it. &quot;Rick and Russell got production credit, but we [the group members] really did everything&quot;, DMC states. &quot;We did that album in like three months. It was so quick because every rhyme was written on the road and had been practiced and polished. We knew what we wanted to do. Rick was all music and instruments. Jay was music and DJing. And me and Run was lyrics. We definitely had a game plan.&quot;

&quot;Raising Hell&quot; features the well-known cover &quot;Walk This Way&quot; featuring Aerosmith (largely the work of its leaders, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry). While the song was not the group&#x27;s first fusion of rock and hip hop (the group&#x27;s earlier singles &quot;Rock Box&quot; and &quot;King of Rock&quot; were), it was the first such fusion significantly impacting the charts, becoming the first rap song to crack the top 5 of The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Raising Hell&quot; peaked at No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Top R&amp;B Albums chart as the first hip hop/rap album to do so, and at No. 3 on the Billboard 200.

== Reception ==

&quot;Raising Hell&quot; was voted fifth best album of 1986 in the Pazz &amp; Jop poll of American critics nationwide, published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator, wrote in a contemporary review: &quot;Without benefit of a &#x27;Rock Box&#x27; or &#x27;King of Rock,&#x27; this is [Run-D.M.C.&#x27;s] most uncompromising and compelling album, all hard beats and declaiming voices.&quot;

In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Richard Cromelin wrote: &quot;If the same old boasts are wearing thin and the misogyny gets grating, the beats are infectious and varied and the vocal trade-offs can be dazzling.&quot;

It ranked number 8 among the &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; in &quot;NME&quot;.

In 1987, the Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap - Single was jointly awarded to Run-D.M.C. and Aerosmith for &quot;Walk This Way&quot;.

In 1989, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; music critics took to look over the albums they had reviewed in the past 10 years to include in a list based on &quot;commercial impact to social import, to strictly musical merit.&quot; &quot;Raising Hell&quot; was placed at number four on the list, describing it as &quot;the record to move rap from the ghetto to the suburbs. Blame it or celebrate it, you can&#x27;t deny Raising Hell&#x27;s impact.

In 1998, the album appeared in &quot;The Source&#x27;s&quot; 100 Best Rap Albums. &quot;Q&quot; magazine (12/99, p. 162) – 5 stars out of 5 – &quot;... the apex of pre-Public Enemy, beatbox-based hip hop, a monument of massive, crisp beats plus the genre-bending &#x27;Walk This Way&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Vibe&quot; (12/99, p. 162) – Included in Vibe&#x27;s 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century. &quot;Uncut&quot; (11/03, p. 130) – 4 stars out of 5 – &quot;[An album] that forced the music biz to take rap seriously.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (12/11/03, p. 126) – &quot;[T]he pioneering trio took hip-hop into the upper reaches of the pop charts, introducing mainstream to a new urban thunder: rap rock.&quot; &quot;AllMusic&quot; – 5 stars out of 5 – &quot;... the music was fully realized and thoroughly invigorating, rocking harder and better than any of its rock or rap peers in 1986 ...&quot;

In 2003, the album was ranked number 123 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, dropping to number 209 in a 2020 reboot of the list. It ranked fourth on Chris Rock&#x27;s list of the Top 25 Hip-Hop Albums of all time, and the comedian called it &quot;the first great rap album ever&quot;.

In 2006, the album was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 greatest albums. &quot;Time&quot; named it No. 41 of the 100 best albums of the past fifty years and stated that the album was &quot;rap&#x27;s first masterpiece&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at No. 65 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;.

Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D considers &quot;Raising Hell &quot;to be the greatest hip-hop album of all-time, and the reason he chose to sign with Def Jam Records. &quot;It paved the way for so many bands,&quot; he explained, &quot;and opened minds.&quot; In &quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot;, he ranked the album at number one in his top ten (which also included &quot;Tougher Than Leather&quot;) and said: &quot;It was the first record that made me realise this was an album-oriented genre.&quot;

<doc id="195585" wikidata="Q167518" url="?curid=195585" title="Neal Cassady">
<text>Neal Leon Cassady (February 8, 1926 – February 4, 1968) was a major figure of the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the psychedelic and counterculture movements of the 1960s.

Cassady published only two short fragments of prose in his lifetime, but exerted considerable intellectual and stylistic influence through his conversation and correspondence. Letters, poems, and an unfinished autobiographical novel have been published since his death.

He was prominently featured as himself in the &quot;scroll&quot; (first draft) version of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;On the Road&quot;, and served as the model for the character Dean Moriarty in the 1957 version of that book. In many of Kerouac&#x27;s later books, Cassady is represented by the character Cody Pomeray. Cassady also appeared in Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poems, and in several other works of literature by other writers.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===

Cassady was born to Maude Jean (Scheuer) and Neal Marshall Cassady in Salt Lake City, Utah. His mother died when he was 10, and he was raised by his alcoholic father in Denver, Colorado. Cassady spent much of his youth either living on the streets of skid row, with his father, or in reform school.

As a youth, Cassady was repeatedly involved in petty crime. He was arrested for car theft when he was 14, for shoplifting and car theft when he was 15, and for car theft and fencing stolen property when he was 16.

In 1941, the 15-year-old Cassady met Justin W. Brierly, a prominent Denver educator. Brierly was well known as a mentor of promising young men and was impressed by Cassady&#x27;s intelligence. Over the next few years, Brierly took an active role in Cassady&#x27;s life. Brierly helped admit Cassady to East High School where he taught Cassady as a student, encouraged and supervised his reading, and found employment for him. Cassady continued his criminal activities, however, and was repeatedly arrested from 1942 to 1944; on at least one of these occasions, he was released by law enforcement into Brierly&#x27;s safekeeping. In June 1944, Cassady was arrested for possession of stolen goods and served 11 months of a one-year prison sentence. Brierly and he actively exchanged letters during this period, even through Cassady&#x27;s intermittent incarcerations; this correspondence represents Cassady&#x27;s earliest surviving letters. Some authors have suggested that Brierly may have also been responsible for Cassady&#x27;s first homosexual experience.

=== Personal life ===

In October 1945, after being released from prison, Cassady married 16-year-old Lu Anne Henderson. In 1946, the couple traveled to New York City to visit their friend, Hal Chase, another protégé of Brierly&#x27;s. While visiting Chase at Columbia University, Cassady met Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Although Cassady did not attend Columbia, he soon became friends with them and their acquaintances, some of whom later became members of the Beat Generation. While in New York, Cassady persuaded Kerouac to teach him to write fiction. Cassady&#x27;s second wife, Carolyn, has stated, &quot;Neal, having been raised in the slums of Denver amongst the world&#x27;s lost men, determined to make more of himself, to become somebody, to be worthy and respected. His genius mind absorbed every book he could find, whether literature, philosophy, or science. Jack had a formal education, which Neal envied, but intellectually he was more than a match for Jack, and they enjoyed long discussions on every subject.&quot;

Carolyn Robinson met Cassady in 1947, while she was studying for her master&#x27;s in theater arts at the University of Denver. Five weeks after Lu Anne&#x27;s departure, Cassady got an annulment from Lu Anne and married Carolyn on April 1, 1948. Carolyn&#x27;s book, &quot;Off the Road: Twenty Years with Cassady, Kerouac and Ginsberg&quot; (1990), details her marriage to Cassady and recalls him as &quot;the archetype of the American Man&quot;. Cassady&#x27;s sexual relationship with Ginsberg lasted off and on for the next 20 years. 

During this period, Cassady worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad and kept in touch with his &quot;Beat&quot; acquaintances, even as they became increasingly different philosophically. While working there he lived in San Francisco at 29 Russell Street.

The couple eventually had three children and settled down in a ranch house in Monte Sereno, California, 50 miles south of San Francisco, where Kerouac and Ginsberg sometimes visited. This home, built in 1954 with money from a settlement from Southern Pacific Railroad for a train-related accident, was demolished in August 1997.
In 1950, Cassady married Diane Hansen, a young model who was pregnant with his child, Curtis.

Cassady traveled cross-country with both Kerouac and Ginsberg on multiple occasions, including the trips documented in Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;.

=== Role of drugs ===
Following an arrest in 1958 for offering to share a small amount of marijuana with an undercover agent at a San Francisco nightclub, Cassady served a two-year sentence at California&#x27;s San Quentin State Prison. After his release in June 1960, he struggled to meet family obligations, and Carolyn divorced him when his parole period expired in 1963. Carolyn stated that she was looking to relieve Cassady of the burden of supporting a family, but &quot;this was a mistake and removed the last pillar of his self-esteem&quot;.

After the divorce, in 1963, Cassady shared an apartment with Allen Ginsberg and Beat poet Charles Plymell at 1403 Gough Street in San Francisco.

Cassady first met author Ken Kesey during the summer of 1962; he eventually became one of the Merry Pranksters, a group that formed around Kesey in 1964, who were vocal proponents of the use of psychedelic drugs.

=== Travels and death ===
During 1964, Cassady served as the main driver of the bus named &quot;Furthur&quot; on the iconic first half of the journey from San Francisco to New York, which was immortalized by Tom Wolfe&#x27;s book, &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (1968). Cassady appears at length in a documentary film about the Merry Pranksters and their cross-country trip, &quot;Magic Trip&quot; (2011), directed by Alex Gibney.

In January 1967, Cassady traveled to Mexico with fellow prankster George &quot;Barely Visible&quot; Walker and Cassady&#x27;s longtime girlfriend Anne Murphy. In a beachside house just south of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, they were joined by Barbara Wilson and Walter Cox.

During the next year, Cassady&#x27;s life became less stable, and the pace of his travels more frenetic. He left Mexico in May, traveling to San Francisco, Denver, New York City, and points in between. Cassady then returned to Mexico in September and October (stopping in San Antonio on the way to visit his oldest daughter, who had just given birth to his first grandchild), visited Ken Kesey&#x27;s Oregon farm in December, and spent the New Year with Carolyn at a friend&#x27;s house near San Francisco. Finally, in late January 1968, Cassady returned to Mexico once again.

On February 3, 1968, Cassady attended a wedding party in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico. After the party, he went walking along a railroad track to reach the next town, but passed out in the cold and rainy night wearing nothing but a T-shirt and jeans. In the morning, he was found in a coma by the tracks, reportedly by Anton Black, later a professor at El Paso Community College, who carried Cassady over his shoulders to the local post office building. Cassady was then transported to the closest hospital, where he died a few hours later on February 4, aged 41.

The exact cause of Cassady&#x27;s death remains uncertain. Those who attended the wedding party confirm that he took an unknown quantity of secobarbital, a powerful barbiturate sold under the brand name Seconal. The physician who performed the autopsy wrote simply, &quot;general congestion in all systems.&quot; When interviewed later, the physician stated that he was unable to give an accurate report because Cassady was a foreigner and there were drugs involved. &quot;Exposure&quot; is commonly cited as his cause of death, although his widow believes he may have died of kidney failure.

=== Children ===
Cassady has five known children: Robert William Hyatt Jr. (1945), Cathleen Joanne Cassady (1948), Jami Cassady Ratto (1949), Curtis W. Hansen (1950), and John Allen Cassady (1951). Robert, son of Cassady and Maxine Beam, is an artist working in Arvada, Colorado. In February 2017, he was featured in &quot;Westword&quot; magazine. Cathleen, known as Cathy, is the mother of the only grandchild Cassady met. Cathy, Jami, and John keep a website in memory of their parents and parents&#x27; &quot;beat&quot; friends.

Curt, born from Cassady&#x27;s marriage with Diana Hansen, died April 30, 2014, aged 63. He was one of the co-founders of radio station WEBE 108, in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

== Writing style and influence ==
Cassady is credited with helping Kerouac break with his Thomas Wolfe-influenced sentimental style, as seen in &quot;The Town and the City&quot; (1950). After reading Cassady&#x27;s letters, Kerouac was inspired to write his story in Cassady&#x27;s communication style: &quot;...in a rush of mad ecstasy, without self-consciousness or mental hesitation&quot;.

This fluid writing style, reading more like a stream of consciousness or hypermanic rapid-fire conversation than written prose, is best demonstrated within Cassady&#x27;s letters to family and friends. In a letter to Kerouac from 1953, Cassady begins with the following fervent sentence;

Well it&#x27;s about time you wrote, I was fearing you farted out on top that mean mountain or slid under while pissing in Pismo, beach of flowers, food and foolishness, but I knew the fear was ill-founded for balancing it in my thoughts of you, much stronger and valid if you weren&#x27;t dead, was a realization of the experiences you would be having down there, rail, home, and the most important, climate, by a remembrance of my own feelings and thoughts (former low, or more exactly, nostalgic and unreal; latter hi) as, for example, I too seemed to spend time looking out upper floor windows at sparse, especially night times, traffic in females—old or young.

&quot;On the Road&quot; became a sensation. By capturing Cassady&#x27;s voice, Kerouac discovered a unique style of his own that he called &quot;spontaneous prose,&quot; a stream of consciousness prose form.

Cassady&#x27;s own written work was never formally published in his lifetime, and he left behind only a half-written manuscript and a number of personal letters. Cassady admitted to Kerouac in a letter from 1948, &quot;My prose has no individual style as such, but is rather an unspoken and still unexpressed groping toward the personal. There is something there that wants to come out; something of my own that must be said. Yet, perhaps, words are not the way for me.&quot;

=== In film ===
==== Archival footage ====
* &quot;Anthem to Beauty&quot; (1997).
* &quot;Love Always, Carolyn — A film about Kerouac, Cassady and Me&quot; (2011), a documentary that features Cassady in archival segments, as well as interviews with Cassady&#x27;s ex-wife Carolyn and his children.
* &quot;Magic Trip&quot; (2011), Alex Gibney&#x27;s documentary film using the footage shot by Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters during their cross-country bus trip in the &quot;Furthur&quot; bus; the hyperkinetic Cassady is frequently seen driving the bus, jabbering, and sitting next to a sign that boasts, &quot;Neal gets things done.&quot;
* &quot;The Other One: The Long Strange Trip of Bob Weir&quot; (2015).

==== Dramatizations ====
* The film &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot; (1978) is a psychological drama released by United Artists. The film is based on Robert Stone&#x27;s novel &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; (1974), and stars Nick Nolte as Ray Hicks. Stone based the character of Hicks on Beat writer Neal Cassady. Stone became acquainted with Cassady through novelist Ken Kesey, a classmate of Stone in graduate school at Stanford University. Hicks&#x27; death scene on the railroad tracks at the film&#x27;s conclusion was directly based on Cassady&#x27;s death along a railroad track outside of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, in 1968.
* &quot;Heart Beat&quot; (1980), which portrays Neal Cassady&#x27;s friendship with Jack Kerouac, stars Nick Nolte as Cassady and John Heard as Kerouac. The film was based on the memoir of the same name by Carolyn Cassady (played by Sissy Spacek). Talk show host Steve Allen, who was a big supporter of &quot;On The Road&quot;, appears briefly as himself. Released immediately after Warner Bros. acquired Orion Pictures, the film was given a limited release due to studio politics and a perceived lack of public interest. The film quickly fell from view.
* &quot;What Happened to Kerouac&quot; (1986).
* &quot;The Last Time I Committed Suicide&quot; (1997), with Thomas Jane as Cassady, is based on the &quot;Joan Anderson letter&quot; written by Cassady to Jack Kerouac in December 1950. Until 2014, much of this letter was thought to have been lost, though an excerpt had been published in a 1964 edition of John Bryan&#x27;s magazine &quot;Notes from Underground&quot;.
* A short film &quot;Luz Del Mundo&quot; (2007) deals with Cassady&#x27;s friendship and adventures with Jack Kerouac. Cassady is played by Austin Nichols, and Kerouac is played by Will Estes.
* In the film &quot;Across the Universe&quot; (2007), the character Dr. Robert, played by Bono, is said to have been inspired by Neal Cassady.
* &quot;Neal Cassady&quot; (2007), a biographical film focused mostly on the Merry Prankster years and stars Tate Donovan as Neal, Amy Ryan as Carolyn Cassady, Chris Bauer as Kesey, and Glenn Fitzgerald as Kerouac; Noah Buschel wrote and directed the film, which deals primarily with how Neal became trapped by his fictional alter-ego, Dean Moriarty. The Cassady family criticized this film as highly inaccurate.
* &quot;Howl&quot; (2010), Jon Prescott, chronicles Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s creation of the poem &quot;Howl&quot; and the obscenity trial surrounding its publication; Jon Prescott portrays Cassady.
* In &quot;On the Road&quot; (2012), the dramatic adaptation of the book, Neal Cassady/Dean Moriarty is portrayed by Garrett Hedlund.
* In &quot;Big Sur&quot; (2013), Josh Lucas portrays Cassady.

** &quot;The Horn&quot; (1958) as &quot;the driver&quot;
* Jack Kerouac:
** &quot;On the Road&quot; (1957) as &quot;Dean Moriarty&quot;. Cassady was the model for the character Dean Moriarty in Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;, and the character &quot;Cody Pomeray&quot; in many of Kerouac&#x27;s other novels. In the surviving first draft of &quot;On the Road&quot;, which Kerouac typed on a 120-foot roll of paper specially constructed for that purpose, the story&#x27;s protagonist&#x27;s name remains &quot;Neal Cassady&quot;. However, in Kerouac&#x27;s final edition of &quot;On The Road&quot;, Cassady&#x27;s character is known as &quot;Dean Moriarty&quot;. In &quot;On the Road&quot;, the narrator, Sal Paradise (representing Jack Kerouac) states, &quot;He was simply a youth tremendously excited with life, and though he was a con-man, he was only conning because he wanted so much to live and to get involved with people who would otherwise pay no attention to him ... Somewhere along the line, I knew there&#x27;d be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line, the pearl would be handed to me.&quot;

** &quot;Big Sur&quot; (1962) as &quot;Cody Pomeray&quot;
** &quot;Desolation Angels (novel)&quot; (1965) as &quot;Cody Pomeray&quot;
* Ken Kesey:
** &quot;Over the Border&quot; (1973), as &quot;Houlihan&quot;
** Kesey also wrote a fictional account of Cassady&#x27;s death in the short story &quot;The Day After Superman Died&quot; (1979, referring to Cassady as &quot;Houlihan&quot;), wherein Cassady is portrayed as mumbling about the number of railroad ties he had counted on the line (64,928) as his last words before dying. It was published as a part of Kesey&#x27;s collection &quot;Demon Box&quot; (1986).
** One of the interviewees in the film &quot;Magic Trip&quot; (2011) states that Cassady was the inspiration for the main character, Randle Patrick McMurphy, of Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1962).
* Phil Lesh&#x27;s &quot;Searching for the Sound: My Life with the Grateful Dead&quot; (2005)
* Nick Mamatas&#x27; &quot;Move Under Ground&quot; (2004)
* Chuck Rosenthal&#x27;s &quot;Jack Kerouac&#x27;s Avatar Angel: His Last Novel&quot; (2001), as &quot;Cody Pomeray.&quot;
* Robert Stone:
** &quot;Porque No Tiene, Porque Le Falta&quot; (1969), as &quot;Willie Wings&quot;
** &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; (1974), as &quot;Ray Hicks&quot;
** &quot;Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties&quot; (2007)
* In Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s book &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1966), Cassady is described as, &quot;the worldly inspiration for the protagonist of two recent novels&quot;, drunkenly yelling at police during the famed Hells Angels parties at Ken Kesey&#x27;s residence in La Honda, California. Although Cassady&#x27;s name was removed from the book at the insistence of Thompson&#x27;s publisher, the description is clearly a reference to the character based on Cassady in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s works, &quot;On the Road&quot; and &quot;Visions of Cody&quot; (1951–1952).
* Tom Wolfe also chronicled Cassady&#x27;s drunken yelling at police during Hells Angels parties in &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (1968).

=== In music ===
* Tom Waits recorded &quot;Jack &amp; Neal /California, Here I Come,&quot; on his 1977 album &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;.
* A New York City-based folk duo, Aztec Two Step, in their 1972 debut album memorialized Cassady in the song &quot;The Persecution &amp; Restoration of Dean Moriarty (On The Road)&quot;.
* Death Cab for Cutie loosely based their song &quot;Styrofoam Plates&quot; from &quot;The Photo Album&quot; (2001) on the events of Cassady&#x27;s life depicted in &quot;On the Road&quot;.
* The Doobie Brothers guitarist and songwriter Patrick Simmons refers to Cassady in his song &quot;Neal&#x27;s Fandango&quot; as his incentive for taking to the road.
* Cassady lived briefly with The Grateful Dead and is immortalized in &quot;The Other One&quot; section of their song &quot;That&#x27;s It for the Other One&quot;, as the bus driver &quot;Cowboy Neal&quot;.
* A second Grateful Dead song, &quot;Cassidy&quot; by John Perry Barlow, might seem to be a misspelling of Cassady&#x27;s name. However, in fact, the song primarily celebrates the 1970 birth of baby girl Cassidy Law into the Grateful Dead family, though the lyrics also include references to Neal Cassady himself.
* Bocephus King sings a song called &quot;Cowboy Neal&quot;.
* The progressive rock band King Crimson released a song named &quot;Neal and Jack and Me&quot; on their album &quot;Beat&quot; (1982).
* Morrissey&#x27;s album &quot;World Peace Is None of Your Business&quot; (2014) features a track called &quot;Neal Cassady Drops Dead&quot;.
* The Franco-American band Moriarty is named after the fictional character Dean Moriarty that Kerouac created from Neal Cassady.
* Jazz guitarist John Scofield wrote a song called &quot;Cassidae&quot; , released on his album &quot;Who&#x27;s who?&quot; (1979).
* Singer-songwriter Eric Taylor&#x27;s song &quot;Dean Moriarty&quot; (1995) describes a character patterned after Neal Cassady.
* Fatboy Slim produced a track, &quot;Neal Cassady Starts Here&quot;, that appeared as a B-side to the singles &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; and &quot;Everybody Needs A 303&quot; (1996).
* The Beat-inspired folk revival band Washington Squares released a song named &quot;Neal Cassady&quot; on their album &quot;Fair and Square&quot; (1989).

== Published works ==
* &quot;The Joan Anderson Letter&quot;, written by Cassady to Jack Kerouac (December 1950): it was, until 2014, thought to have been lost, though an excerpt had been published in a 1964 edition of John Bryan&#x27;s magazine &quot;Notes from Underground&quot;. Associated Press reported in November 24, 2014, that the entire letter had been found. The 18-page letter, which is said to have substantially inspired Kerouac&#x27;s subsequent writing style, was to be auctioned on December 17, 2014, but a legal dispute over ownership prevented the auction from proceeding. The original letter was auctioned by Heritage Auctions as Lot 45378 on March 8, 2017.

<doc id="195591" wikidata="Q235486" url="?curid=195591" title="461 Ocean Boulevard">
<text>461 Ocean Boulevard is the second solo studio album by English musician Eric Clapton. It was released in late July 1974 by RSO Records, after the record company released the hit single &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; earlier in the month. The album topped various international charts and sold more than two million copies.

The album was Clapton&#x27;s return to the recording studio after a three-year hiatus due to his heroin addiction. The title refers to the address on Ocean Boulevard in Golden Beach, Florida, where Clapton lived while recording the album. Upon completing the album, Clapton and RSO head Robert Stigwood recommended the house and Miami&#x27;s Criteria Studios to fellow RSO artists the Bee Gees, who then moved in to write and record &quot;Main Course&quot;. The street address of the house was changed after the album&#x27;s release.

A remastered two-disc deluxe edition of the album was released in 2004, which included selections from two live shows at the Hammersmith Odeon, and additional studio jam sessions.

==Production==
After overcoming his heroin addiction, Clapton realized that he had wasted three years of his life, stating he had not done anything other than watch television and get out of shape. When Clapton sought help working on a farm, he began to listen to a lot of new music and old blues records he had brought with him and started to play again, even writing whole songs out of simple ideas. With these song ideas in mind, Clapton was given a demo tape by Carl Radle, the former bassist for Derek and the Dominos, with songs performed by Radle with keyboardist Dick Sims and drummer Jamie Oldaker. Clapton liked the recordings, calling them &quot;simply superb&quot;.

Clapton was given time to write new material for a next album by Radle. When Clapton set to work on tracks for the upcoming studio release, he wanted to leave his songs as incomplete as possible, so that the musicians, who were going to record with Clapton in the studio, would get the chance to make them their own. After Clapton appeared in the rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot;, his manager at the time, Robert Stigwood, contacted him about a new project. Stigwood arranged for Clapton to record at the Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, with Radle, Sims, Oldaker and record producer Tom Dowd. When the time came to record the new album, Clapton was worried about both its commercial and artistic success, noting his concept of a new album would work only when there was chemistry between the musicians. Clapton also hired guest vocalist Yvonne Elliman and guitarist George Terry as full-time members of his group.

Stigwood also paid for Clapton to live at a rental house at 461 Ocean Boulevard in the town of Golden Beach near Miami. The whole album was recorded from April to May 1974. For the recording sessions, Clapton used his Blackie Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. For slide guitar work, Clapton used several Gibson ES-335 guitars. He also played vintage Martin acoustic guitars.

==Music and lyrics==
Ryan Book of &quot;Music Times&quot; felt the music on the album ranges from &quot;bright blues rock&quot; to sentimental ballads like &quot;Let It Grow&quot;,
and Robert Christgau said it features &quot;sleepy postjunk funk&quot; with intimations of sex.

In his 2007 autobiography &quot;My Life&quot;, Clapton recalls that he was very pleased with the song&#x27;s lyrics and instrumental parts of &quot;Let It Grow&quot;, which he had written himself, although music critics and also Clapton noted, that the melody and chord progression is nearly the same as Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Except for &quot;Let It Grow&quot; and &quot;Get Ready&quot;, a song Clapton wrote with guest vocalist Yvonne Elliman about her, the album consists of various cover versions of titles that had been in Clapton&#x27;s head for a long time: &quot;Willie and the Hand Jive&quot;, &quot;Steady Rollin&#x27; Man&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Hold Out&quot;. Clapton had first heard the song &quot;Give Me Strength&quot; in London in the 1960s, when he had been living with Charlie and Diana Radcliffe on Fulham Road. He wanted to record the song, as he thought it would be a good fit for the album. While the band was recording, George Terry brought the album &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot; from Bob Marley and the Wailers to Clapton&#x27;s attention, stating he really liked the song &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot;. He persuaded Clapton to record a version of this tune, which Clapton disliked, because of its &quot;hardcore reggae&quot; melody. Finally, the band convinced Clapton to put the song on the album, noting it would definitely become a hit single. When Clapton met Bob Marley years after his take on the tune was released, Marley told Clapton he really liked the cover.

The album finishes with George Terry&#x27;s &quot;Mainline Florida&quot;, which &quot;breaks away from the established tone of the record&quot; and features Clapton using a talk box.

==Marketing and sales==
&quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; was released in July 1974 on vinyl and compact music cassette in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. RSO Records decided to release the album in territories, where it might chart and sell a lot of copies; it was released in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, in the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, in the United Kingdom, in the United States, Uruguay, Yugoslavia and Venezuela. Therefore, it was one of the few pop-music albums to be legally sold in the USSR. Over the years, the album was reissued several times including in 1988, 1996 and 2004 for reunited Europe, also in compact disc format and via digital music download.

&quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; is one of Clapton&#x27;s most successful commercial releases, reaching the Top 10 in eight countries, and peaking at number one in three territories including Canada and the United States. The album reached the Top 5 in the United Kingdom, peaking at number three. In the Netherlands and Norway, the 1974 studio release reached number four on the national album charts. In Germany and New Zealand, the album reached eleven and thirty-eight respectively. On the 1974 year-end charts, the studio album reached number five on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; chart and in the Netherlands, the album was ranked at number twenty-two. In the United States, the release was certified with a Gold disc for shipment figures of more than 500,000 copies.

Two singles were released; the first, &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot;, was released by RSO Records in early July 1974, before the album was released. Clapton&#x27;s take on the Marley tune outplayed the original version, reaching the Top 10 single charts in nine countries, becoming Clapton&#x27;s only number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. In 2003, Clapton&#x27;s version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. The single was also Clapton&#x27;s first single to sell well internationally, achieving Gold certifications in the United States as well as a double Platinum award in Canada. The second track to be released as a single was &quot;Willie and the Hand Jive&quot;, which came out in October 1974. Clapton slowed down the tempo for his version. Author Chris Welch believes that the song benefits from this &quot;slow burn&quot;. However, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Ken Emerson complains that the song sounds &quot;disconcertingly mournful&quot;. Other critics praised Clapton&#x27;s confident vocals. Author Marc Roberty claimed that on this song, &quot;Clapton&#x27;s vocals had clearly matured, with fluctuations and intonations that were convincing rather than tentative as in the past&quot;. Clapton&#x27;s version of the song was released as a single in 1974 and reached number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and position 28 in the Netherlands.

==Critical reception and legacy==

Reviewing for &quot;Creem&quot; in September 1974, Robert Christgau said: &quot;As unlikely as it seems, Clapton has taken being laid-back into a new dimension. Perhaps the most brilliant exploration of the metaphorical capacities of country blues ever attempted, way better than Taj Mahal for all of side one. On side two, unfortunately, he goes a little soft. But I&#x27;ll settle for two questionable live albums if he&#x27;ll give us a solo record as good as this every three years.&quot; He later expanded on this praise in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981):

In 1974, journalist Ken Emerson at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Clapton&#x27;s guitar work unnotable and criticized Clapton for hiding behind his other musicians, whom Emerson deemed less than capable. Emerson also questioned Clapton&#x27;s decision to play a dobro on the album, but called &quot;Let It Grow&quot; a highlight. Emerson considered Clapton&#x27;s re-arrangement of &quot;Motherless Children&quot; to be too upbeat for a sombre song.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls the studio album a &quot;tighter, more focused outing that enables Clapton to stretch out instrumentally&quot; and adds that the &quot;pop concessions on the album [as well as] the sleek production [and] the concise running times don&#x27;t detract from the rootsy origins of the material&quot;. Finishing his review, Erlewine notes, the &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; &quot;set the template for Clapton&#x27;s 1970s albums&quot;. The critic awarded the release four and a half out of five possible stars. For the &quot;Blender&quot; magazine review of the album&#x27;s 2004 deluxe edition, Jon Pareles called the Eric Clapton of the Cream-era superior to the Clapton of the &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot;-era, because of what Pareles describes as strained singing on &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot;. Pareles also described Clapton&#x27;s remake of &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; as a copy with no original arrangement; he also praised the song &quot;Let It Grow&quot;, but criticized it for sounding too much like &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;.

In a retrospective review for &quot;Uncut&quot;, Nigel Williamson considered that with &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot;, Clapton &quot;rediscovered the primacy of music in his life&quot;. Critic Ryan Book from &quot;The Music Times&quot; likes the track listing very much and thinks that &quot;the climate comes out in Clapton&#x27;s work, ten tracks ranging from bright blues rock to, well, &#x27;Let It Grow&#x27;.&quot; Eduardo Rivadavia at &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; calls the release a &quot;watershed solo LP&quot; and notes the popularity of the album, stating it is a &quot;wanted man&quot;. The journalist finished his review by calling &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; the album in which Clapton&#x27;s &quot;incomparable talents and this inspired song set were finally captured&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the album at No. 411 on its 2012 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, commenting that Clapton had &quot;returned from heroin addiction with a disc of mellow, springy grooves minus guitar histrionics&quot;, which &quot;paid tribute to Robert Johnson and Elmore James&quot;. The album was included Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="195592" wikidata="Q7010437" url="?curid=195592" title="New Miserable Experience">
<text>New Miserable Experience is the second studio album by alternative rock band Gin Blossoms, released on August 4, 1992. The album was released to little fanfare and relatively lackluster reviews. However, nearly a year after its release the lead single &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot; entered the top 40. With &quot;Found Out About You&quot; following a few months later, the album eventually reached multi-platinum status.

==Background==
The band&#x27;s original lead guitarist, Doug Hopkins, was fired near the conclusion of the recording sessions for the album, ostensibly for his persistent alcohol problems. His replacement, Scott Johnson, is listed as a member of the band in the liner notes, but did not play on the album. Just as the album was becoming a success at the end of 1993, Hopkins died by suicide.

&quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;″s initial release had completely different packaging. The album&#x27;s original cover artwork depicted the Arizona desert. Several songs on the album were written with references to the area, people, and events surrounding the band at the time, such as &quot;Mrs. Rita&quot;, which is a song about a local psychic from the Gin Blossoms&#x27; hometown of Tempe, Arizona. The majority of the songs rely on a melody-driven pop style, while the final track, &quot;Cheatin&#x27;&quot;, leans into country.

The album was re-released in late summer 1993 with a new cover without the original Arizona desert photo. This re-release in conjunction with A&amp;M&#x27;s newfound support of the album. Lead singer Robin Wilson specifically requested artistic control over the new release, recalling, &quot;I did insist that I have total control over the new cover. So what you see on &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;, those are all my photographs. I did the layout, I handwrote all the lyrics and I made sure that I had control over that.&quot;

==Musical style==
The album&#x27;s music has been described as alternative rock, jangle pop, and power pop.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Paul Evans praised &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;, saying it &quot;sounds both fresh and highly personal.&quot; In his review for AllMusic, Rick Anderson called the album &quot;a tight and lean collection of brilliant, edgy pop music&quot;. Evan Rytlewski of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described it as &quot;a tender and sincere record that made the band famous while they grappled with tragedy.&quot;

== Track listing ==
To celebrate the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary in 2002, a deluxe edition containing an extra disc of demos, outtakes and live performances was released by the label. The Rarities Album was released separately in Abbreviated form in 2010 as &quot;Rarities&quot;, missing the three cuts from &quot;Dusted&quot;.

<doc id="195594" wikidata="Q200030" url="?curid=195594" title="Latakia">
<text>Latakia (; ; ) is the principal port city of Syria and capital city of the Latakia Governorate located on the Mediterranean coast. Historically, it has also been known as [[Laodicea in Syria]] or Laodicea ad Mare. In addition to serving as a port, the city is a significant manufacturing center for surrounding agricultural towns and villages. According to a 2023 estimate, the population of the city is 709,000, its population greatly increased as a result of the ongoing Syrian Civil War, which led to an influx of internally displaced persons from rebel held areas. It is the 5th-largest city in Syria after Aleppo, Damascus, Homs and Hama. Cape Apostolos Andreas, the north-eastern tip of Cyprus, is about away.

Although the site of the city has been inhabited since the 2nd millennium BC, the city was founded as a Greek city in the 4th century BC under the rule of the Greek Seleucid Empire. Latakia was subsequently ruled by the Romans and Byzantines, followed by the Rashiduns, Ummayads and Abbasids during the 7th–10th centuries AD. Byzantine ruling groups frequently attacked the city, periodically recapturing it before losing it again to Arab powers, particularly the Fatimids. Afterward, Latakia was ruled successively by the Seljuk Turks, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, and the Ottomans. Following World War I, Latakia was assigned to the French mandate of Syria, in which it served as the capital of the autonomous territory of the Alawites. This autonomous territory became the Alawite State in 1922, proclaiming its independence a number of times until reintegrating into Syria in 1944.

==Etymology==

Like many Greek Seleucid cities, Latakia was named after a member of the ruling dynasty. It was first called &quot;Laodikeia on the Coast&quot; () by Seleucus I Nicator in honor of his mother, Laodice. In Latin, its name became &quot;Laodicea ad Mare&quot;. The original name survives in its Arabic form as &quot;al-Ladhiqiyyah&quot; (), from which the French &quot;Lattaquié&quot; and English &quot;Latakia&quot; (or &quot;Lattakia)&quot; derive. To the Ottomans, it was known as Lazkiye.

==History==
===Ancient settlement and founding===
The location of Latakia, the Ras Ziyarah promontory, has a long history of occupation. The Phoenician city of Ramitha was located here. Stephanus of Byzantium writes that the city was named Ramitha (), then &quot;Leukê Aktê&quot; (&quot;white coast&quot;) () and later Laodicea ().

The city was described in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot;:
===Roman rule===
Pompey the Great conquered the city along with most of Syria in the 1st century BC, and Julius Caesar declared the city a &quot;free polis.&quot; The Roman emperor Septimius Severus rewarded the city with the title of &quot;Metropolis&quot; in the 2nd century AD, exempted it of the empire&#x27;s taxation, fortified the city, made it for a few years the capital of Roman Syria and also built the city&#x27;s famed Tetraporticus around the same time. Some Roman merchants moved to live in the city under Augustus, but the city was always culturally &quot;Greek&quot; influenced. Subsequently, a Roman road was built from southern Anatolia toward Berytus and Damascus, that greatly improved the commerce through the port of Laodicea.

The heretic Apollinarius was bishop of Lāŏdĭcḗa in the 4th century. The city minted coins from an early date, but decreasing in importance after the cities of Alexandria and Antioch flourished in coin minting and overshadowed other cities.

The city was also famed for its wine produced around the port&#x27;s hills which were exported to all the empire.

During the split of the Roman Empire, it belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire. An earthquake damaged the city in 494, but the city was later reconstructed by Justinian I and made the capital of the Eastern Roman province of Theodorias from 528 AD until Muslim conquest around 637 AD.
===Early Islamic era===
All of Syria, including the Roman province of Theodorias and its capital, Laodicea fell into Muslim rule after being attacked by a caliphate general, named &#x27;Ubadah ibn al-Samit during the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 7th century. The city was renamed al-Lādhiqīyah (اللَّاذِقِيَّة) and switched rule from the Rashidun Caliphate, to the Umayyad Caliphate and finally to the Abbasid Caliphate in a span of 9 centuries, attached to the large province of Bilad Al-Sham (Greater Syria). Arab geographer, Al-Muqaddasi (d. 991), mentions al-Lādhiqīyah as belonging to the district of Hims (Homs).

===Crusader, Ayyubid, and Mamlouk rule===

The Mardaites controlled the region from Jebel Aqra to northern Palestine, including Latakia in 705. However, they later withdrew from the city after an agreement with the Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I. Afterwards, the Mardaites sacked it in 719, but it was rebuilt by Umar II. The city lost its importance due to its location on the border between the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate from 750 to 968. The famous poet Al-Mutanabbi led a millenarian revolt at Latakia in 930. The Byzantine Empire recaptured the city in 970 by John I Tzimiskes, but it was lost to the Fatimids in 980. The Banu Munqidh managed to control the city until they were succeeded by the Seljuks during the reign of Malik-Shah I in 1086, despite a brief Byzantine control in 1074. Later on, Guynemer of Boulogne raided the city on 19 August 1097, with 28 ships coming from Cyprus during the First Crusade. In 1098, Raymond of Saint-Gilles captured the city, with the Byzantine fleet presence; hence, the city became contested between the crusaders and the Byzantines who controlled Latakia and Baniyas in the meantime.

After failed efforts by Bohemond I of Antioch to capture Latakia from the Byzantine Empire in 1099, and a brief control of the Genoese fleet in 1101, the city was taken in 1103 by forces under the command of Tancred of Hauteville, a veteran of the First Crusade and acting regent of the Principality of Antioch. Following the defeat of Antiochene forces at the Battle of Harran in 1104, the city was reoccupied by the Byzantines led by Admiral Cantacuzenus, however they would again lose the city. Despite a treaty in 1108 with Bohemond promising to return Latakia to the Byzantine Empire by 1110 it was firmly under the control of the Principality of Antioch, as it was called &quot;La Liche&quot;. In 1126, the cities of Latakia and Jabala were the dowry of Princess Alice, daughter of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem, who later donated a house in Latakia to the Knights Hospitaller, which became their main base in the region. In April 1136, the city was sacked by Emir Sawar ibn Aytakin, governor of Aleppo, then it was struck by the 1157 Hama earthquake and the 1170 Syria earthquake.

This situation remained the same with the city serving as the primary port for the Principality until it was captured following a siege by the Ayyubids, under the rule of Saladin on 23 July 1188. By 1260, the crusaders recaptured the city, until they were defeated by the Mamluks of Qalawun, on 20 April 1287.

In circa 1300, Arab geographer al-Dimashqi noted that Latakia had no running water and that trees were scarce, but the city&#x27;s port was &quot;a wonderful harbor... full of large ships&quot;. In 1332, the Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta visited Latakia in his journeys.

During the late 14th and 15th century, Venetians had a consul in Latakia, due to the trade of cotton and silk from Persia. The city which was in despair was rebuilt after a visit by Qaitbay in 1477.

An Alawite community was first established in Latakia by the missionary Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Tabarani (d. 1034) in the early 11th century. From then on it spread northward and into the coastal mountain range.

===Ottoman rule===

Latakia came under the Ottoman control after the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516. It had a population of about 1400–1700 in the 16th century. From the late 17th century onward it was ruled by the Ibn al-Matarji family, some of whose members would go on to become governors of Damascus Eyalet. Under their leadership, and the development of the tobacco industry in the same period, the town developed rapidly in the 18th century. Several churches were rebuilt or restored and the Azm family of governors established several new foundations in the city. The British, French and Spanish established consulates in the city, so that by mid-century Latakia was serving as co-capital of the entire province (&quot;eyalet&quot;) of Tripoli, Lebanon.
In 1824, the Ottomans named Muhammad Paşa ibn Alman, a native of the area who was suspected of being an Alawite and a French sympathizer, governor of Latakia. He was killed in an urban revolt later that year that was inspired by the fundamentalist shaykh Muhammad al-Moghrabi. During the Egyptian occupation of Syria (1831–1841) there was a major Alawite revolt (1834-1835) in both the town and the surrounding countryside.

In 1888, when Wilayat Beirut was established, Latakia became its northernmost town.

In the Ottoman period, the region of Latakia became predominantly Alawi. The Turkmen also consisted a significant minority. The city itself, however, contained significant numbers of Sunni and Christian inhabitants. The landlords in the countryside tended to be Sunni and Orthodox Christians, while the peasants were mostly Alawi. Like the Druzes, who also had a special status before the end of World War I, the Alawis had a strained relationship with the Ottoman overlords. In fact, they were not even given the status of millet, although they enjoyed relative autonomy.

===French Mandate period===
In 1920, Latakia fell under the French mandate, under which the Alawite State was established. The state was named after the locally-dominant Alawites and became a French mandate territory after World War I. The French Mandate from the League of Nations began in 1920. The creation of the Alawite State, as well as the other states of Syria under the French Mandate, has often been interpreted as a &quot;divide and rule&quot; strategy by the French, who sought to undermine anti-colonial nationalist movements. The French justified the creation of the Alawite state by citing the &quot;backwardness&quot; of the mountain-dwellers, religiously distinct from the surrounding Sunni population; they claimed that the division protected the Alawi people from more-powerful Sunni majorities.

This division by the French administration in Syria did not stop Alawites such as Sheikh Saleh al-Ali, who led the Syrian Revolt of 1919, in continuing to protest French rule. Saleh al-Ali coordinated with the leaders of other anti-French revolts in the country, including the revolt of Ibrahim Hananu in the Aleppo countryside and Subhi Barakat&#x27;s revolt in Antioch, but Saleh al-Ali&#x27;s revolt was put down in 1921. A French court-martial in Latakia sentenced Shaykh Saleh to death in absentia and offered a reward of 100,000 francs for information on his whereabouts. After the French gave up trying to capturing Shaykh Saleh, a pardon was issued by General Henri Gouraud.

The state became part of the Syrian Federation in 1922, but it left the federation again in 1924. In 1930, the Alawite State was renamed as the Government of Latakia, the only concession by the French to Arab nationalists until 1936. On 3 December 1936, it was decided that the Alawite state would be re-incorporated into Syria as a concession by the French to the Nationalist Bloc, which was the ruling party of the semi-autonomous Syrian government; the decision went into effect in 1937.

There was a great deal of Alawite separatist sentiment in the region, but their political views could not be coordinated into a unified voice. There was also a great deal of factionalism amongst the Alawite tribes, and the Alawite State was incorporated into Syria with little organised resistance.

In 1942, the Latakia and Druze regions were returned to Syrian control, and by 1946, the French completely left Syria and a new independent government was created.

===Modern era===

All but a few classical buildings had been destroyed by the modern era, often by earthquakes; those remaining include a Roman triumphal arch and Corinthian columns known as the Colonnade of Bacchus. However, important remains from the city at Roman and Hellenistic periods including full body statues, Roman funerary art, and column capitals that once belonged to the ancient city, now found in its national museum.

An extensive port project was proposed in 1948, and construction work began on the Port of Latakia in 1950, aided by a US$6 million loan from Saudi Arabia. By 1951, the first stage of its construction was completed, and the port handled an increasing amount of Syria&#x27;s overseas trade.

In August 1957, 4,000 Egyptian troops landed in Latakia under orders from Gamal Abdel Nasser after Turkish troops massed along the border with Syria, accusing it of harboring Turkish Communists.

A major highway linked Latakia with Aleppo and the Euphrates valley starting in 1968, supplemented by the completion of a railway line to Homs. The port became even more important after 1975 due to the troubled situation in Lebanon and the loss of Beirut and Tripoli as functioning ports.

In 1973, during the October War (Yom Kippur War), the naval Battle of Latakia between Israel and Syria was fought just offshore from the city. The battle was the first to be fought using missiles and ECM (electronic countermeasures).

On 2 September 1979 clashes broke out following the assassination of an Alawite religious leader in the city. The following day 2,000 paratroopers, commanded by Rifaat al-Assad, were sent to restore order. In the violence that followed around forty people were killed including ten pilots from the Latakia air base.

In 1987, the city hosted the tenth round of the Mediterranean Games, with the opening ceremony hosted by Hafez al-Assad in the Latakia Sports City, a sports complex designed specifically to host the games. The Latakia Sports City Stadium served as the main venue for the games.

In 1994, the city&#x27;s population reached 303,000, with that number significantly rising to 383,786 by 2004. Although population assessment in recent years has become difficult due to the ongoing civil war, the city&#x27;s population is estimated to have risen drastically in the 2010s due to the influx of refugees from the cities of Aleppo, Idlib and other cities which have been affected by the ongoing war.

====Syrian Civil War====

During the Syrian Civil War, Latakia had been a site of protest activity since March 2011. The Syrian government claimed 12 were killed there in clashes in late March, leading to the deployment of the military to restrict movement into and out of the city. Hundreds of Syrians were reportedly arrested, and by late July, activists in Latakia were telling foreign media they feared a more violent crackdown was coming. Protests continued despite the increased security presence and arrests. Several civilians were allegedly killed in confrontations with security officers during this early period of the siege. On 13 August 2011, the Syrian Army and Syrian Navy launched an operation where more than 20 tanks and APCs rolled into the Alawi stronghold. The city was also attacked by the Syrian army on 14 August 2011. Activists claimed that 25 people died during the attack.

Latakia is the home of Russia&#x27;s largest foreign SIGINT facility. Khmeimim Air Base is an airbase near Latakia converted to use by the Russian military in 2015.

Russian president Vladimir Putin, accompanied by his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad visited the Khmeimim airbase, Russia&#x27;s main military base in Syria, located just outside Latakia near Jableh on 11 December 2017. Declaring victory over ISIL, and announcing a partial military withdrawal from Syria, but with continuing Russian presence, as the Khmeimim airbase and the Russian naval facility in Tartus would still be operated by Russian forces.

On 7 December 2021, Israeli warplanes launched an airstrike attack on Latakia&#x27;s port, damaging the port&#x27;s facilities and setting several containers on fire. On December 28, the port was attacked again after Israeli forces launched several precision missiles targeting the port. The attack killed 2 Syrian Army soldiers, destroyed several containers and set the port on fire for several hours.

On 9 December 2024, the day Assad was granted asylum in Moscow, the Russian news agency TASS reported that the armed opposition had taken full control of Latakia Governorate but had not threatened the Russian military bases. During the night to 10 December the Israeli Navy attacked Latakia port and sank 6 Osa-class missile boats of the Syrian Navy.

One of the first censuses was in 1825, which recorded that there were 6,000–8,000 Muslims, 1,000 Greek Orthodox Christians, 30 Armenian Christians, 30 Maronite Catholics, and 30 Jews. At the beginning of the 20th century, Latakia had a population of roughly 7,000 inhabitants; however, the Journal of the Society of Arts recorded a population of 25,000 in 1905. In a 1992 estimate, Latakia had a population of 284,000, rising to 303,000 in the 1994 census. The city&#x27;s population continued to rise, reaching an estimated 402,000 residents in 2002.

In 2010, Latakia City was 50% Alawite, 40% Sunni and 10% Christian; however, the rural hinterland has an Alawite majority of roughly 70%, with Sunni Muslims making up 14%, Christians making up 12%, and Ismailis representing the remaining 2%. The city serves as the capital of the Alawite population and is a major cultural center for the religion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, large numbers of Alawites from the area emigrated to the country&#x27;s capital Damascus. Of the Christians, a sizable Antiochian Greek population exists in Latakia, and their diocese in the city has the largest congregation of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. There is also an Armenian community of 3,500 in the city. The entire population speaks Arabic, mostly in the North Levantine dialect.

Within the city boundaries is the &quot;unofficial&quot; Latakia camp, established in 1956, which has a population of 6,354 Palestinian refugees, mostly from Jaffa and the Galilee.

==Economy==
===Port===
The Port of Latakia is the main seaport in Syria. It was established on 12 February 1950, and has boosted the city&#x27;s importance ever since. The port&#x27;s imported cargo includes clothing, construction materials, vehicles, furniture, minerals, tobacco, cotton, and food supplies such as lintels, onions, wheat, barley, dates, grains and figs, and in 2008, the port handled about 8 million tons of cargo.

The largest area of the port, with 43 hectares, is occupied by the container terminal. The storage capacity is 17,000 containers. Latakia was connected to six ferry lines to Alexandria (Egypt), İzmir (Turkey) and Beirut (Lebanon). It is not known whether the lines still exist in the Syrian civil war, which has been going on since 2011.

The marina Latakia has 150 berths for ships up to a maximum length of 25 meters and 4 meters draught. The Syrian Navy has one of its four bases in Latakia.

===Agriculture===
Latakia has an extensive agricultural hinterland. Exports include bitumen (asphalt), cereals, cotton, fruits, eggs, vegetable oil, pottery, and tobacco. Cotton ginning, vegetable-oil processing, tanning, and sponge fishing serve as local industries for the city.

===Tourism===

:&quot;The information in this section is based on potentially outdated sources, with the most recent source being published in 2004.&quot;

The Cote d&#x27;Azur Beach of Latakia is Syria&#x27;s premier coastal resort, and offers water skiing, jet skiing, and windsurfing. The city contains eight hotels, two of which have five-star ratings; both the Cote d&#x27;Azur de Cham Hotel and Lé Meridien Lattiquie Hotel are located north of the city, at Cote d&#x27;Azur. The latter hotel has 274 rooms and is the only international hotel in the city.

Compared to other Syrian cities, window shopping and evening strolls in the markets is considered a favorite pastime in Latakia. Numerous designer-label stores line 8 Azar Street, and the heart of the city&#x27;s shopping area is the series of blocks enclosed by 8 Azar Street, Yarmouk Street, and Saad Zaghloul Street in the city center. Cinemas in Latakia include Ugarit Cinema, al-Kindi, and a smaller theater off al-Moutanabbi Street.

==Culture==

===Festivals===

The Al-Mahabba Festival, which includes various entertainment programs such as competitions, art parties and archeological and tourist tours to the most important places in the city and is organized by the economic and commercial authorities in cooperation with the Al-Bustan charity organization, is held annually in the city.

===Museums===

The National Museum of Latakia was built in 1986 near the seafront of the city. It formerly housed the residence of the Governor of the Alawite State and was originally a 16th-century Ottoman &quot;khan&quot; (&quot;caravansary&quot;) known as Khan al-Dukhan, meaning &quot;The &quot;Khan&quot; of Smoke&quot;, as it served the tobacco trade. The &quot;khan&quot; historically served not only as an inn, but also contained private residences. The exhibits include inscribed tablets from Ugarit, ancient jewellery, coins, figurines, ceramics, pottery, and early Arab and Crusader-era chain-mail suits and swords.

However, since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, the museum had been temporarily closed, to protect the museum&#x27;s exhibits from the trafficking and looting, which became common during recent years, that the Museums of Palmyra, Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa suffered from. However, the museum&#x27;s gardens are still open to the public, and contain many column capitals, ornaments, funerary tombs and statues which still can be viewed by the public.

===Sport===

Latakia is the home city of three football clubs: Tishreen Sports Club was founded in 1947, Hutteen Sports Club was founded in 1945, and Tadamon SC was founded in 1980. All teams are based in the al-Assad Stadium, which carries a capacity of 28,000 people. Just north of the city is the Latakia Sports City complex, which was built in 1987 to host the 1987 Mediterranean Games.

===Latakia tobacco===

Latakia tobacco is a specially prepared tobacco originally produced in Syria and named after the port city of Latakia. Now the tobacco is mainly produced in Cyprus. It is cured over a stone pine or oak wood fire, which gives it an intense smokey-peppery taste and smell. Rarely smoked straight, it is used as a &quot;condiment&quot; or &quot;blender&quot; (a basic tobacco mixed with other tobaccos to create a blend), especially in English, Balkan, and some American Classic blends.

==Education==

Latakia University of was founded in May 1971, and later renamed Tishreen University (&quot;October University&quot;) in 1976 to commemorate the October War of 1973. The university first had only 3 faculties, Literature, Science and Agriculture and only an enrollment of 983 students during its founding, but that number largely grew throughout the years to reach more than 70,000 students, making the Latakia University the 3rd largest in Syria, with the number of its faculties rising to 17, including Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Science, Nursing, Education, Agriculture, Law, History, Electrical and Technical Engineering and Arts, among others. The city also houses a branch of the Arab Academy for Science and Technology and Maritime Transport.

One of the oldest schools in Latakia, a previous military barracks built during the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon is named after Jules Jammal, an Arab Christian military officer who blew himself up in a suicide attack on a French ship.

On 26 November 2016, Manara University, a private university, was founded under the patronage of Imad Khamis, the Prime Minister of Syria. Its faculties as of 2017 include Pharmacy and Health, Engineering and Business.

==Main sights==
The modern city still exhibits faint traces of its former importance, notwithstanding the frequent earthquakes with which it has been visited. The marina is built upon foundations of ancient columns, and there are in the town an old gateway and other antiquities, as also sarcophagi and sepulchral caves in the neighbourhood. This gateway is a remarkable triumphal arch at the southeast corner of the town, almost entire: it is built with four entrances, like the Forum Jani at Rome. It is conjectured that this arch was built in honour of Lucius Verus, or of Septimius Severus. Fragments of Greek and Latin inscriptions are dispersed all over the ruins, but entirely defaced.

Notable points of interest in the nearby area include the massive Saladin&#x27;s Castle and the ruins of Ugarit, where some of the earliest alphabetic writings have been found. There are also several popular beaches. There are numerous mosques in Latakia, including the 13th-century Great Mosque and the 18th-century Jadid Mosque constructed by Suleiman Pasha Azem.

Latakia has consulates general of Finland and France, and honorary consulates of Greece and Romania.

==Local infrastructure==

===Healthcare===
The Syrian government operates three major public hospitals in Latakia, Al-Assad Hospital, the National Hospital and the Latakia University Hospital, with other private hospitals working for private gain. One of the famous hospitals is Bahrou Hospital.

===Transportation===
Roads link Latakia to Aleppo, Beirut, Homs, and Tripoli. The main commercial coastal road of the city is Jamal Abdel Nasser Street, named after former Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Lined with hotels, restaurants and the city museum, the street begins in central Latakia along the Mediterranean coast and ends at Hitteen Square. From the square, it branches southwest into al-Maghreb al-Arabi Street, south into 8 Azar Street, which continues south to form Baghdad Avenue—the main north–south road—branching into Beirut Street and Nadim Hassan Street along the southern coastline. From the southern portion of Jamal Abdel Nasser Street branch off al-Yarmouk Street and al-Quds Street, the latter which ends at al-Yaman Square in western Latakia, it continues west into Abdel Qader al-Husseini Street. North from al-Yaman Square Souria Avenue and south of the square is al-Ourouba Street. Souria Avenue ends in al-Jumhouriah Square, then continues north as al-Jumhouriah Street.

Much of the city is accessible by taxi and other forms of public transportation. Buses transport people to various Syrian, Lebanese, and Turkish cities, including Aleppo, Damascus, Deir ez-Zor, Palmyra, Tripoli, Beirut, Safita, Homs, Hama, Antakya, and Tartous. The &quot;luxury&quot; Garagat Pullman Bus Station is located on Abdel Qader al-Husseini Street, and at least a dozen private companies are based at the station. On the same street is the older Hob-Hob Bus Station that operates a &quot;depart when full&quot; basis to Damascus and Aleppo. Local microbuses run between al-Yaman Square and the city center, as well as between the station on al-Jalaa Street and the city center. There is also a microbus station with buses departing to Qalaat Salah ed-Din, Qardaha, Kassab, and Jableh.

Latakia&#x27;s railway station is located on al-Yaman Square. Chemins de Fer Syriens operated services, including two daily runs to Aleppo and one weekly run to Damascus via Tartous. In 2005, approximately 512,167 passengers departed from Latakia&#x27;s railway station.

Latakia International Airport is located south of Latakia and serves as a national and regional airport with regular flights to Sharjah, Jeddah, Riyadh and Cairo. The Port of Latakia is also a link in six organized cruises between Alexandria, İzmir and Beirut. In addition, there are irregular ferry services to Cyprus. In 2005, approximately 27,939 passengers used the port.

<text>The United States Information Agency (USIA) was a United States government agency devoted to propaganda which operated from 1953 to 1999. 

Previously existing United States Information Service (USIS) posts operating out of U.S. embassies worldwide since World War II became the field operations offices of the USIA. In 1978, USIA was merged with the Bureau of Educational Cultural Affairs of the Department of State into a new agency called the United States International Communications Agency (USICA). Use of the name United States Information Agency (USIA) was restored in 1982.

In 1999, prior to the reorganization of intelligence agencies by President George W. Bush, President Bill Clinton assigned USIA&#x27;s cultural exchange and non-broadcasting intelligence functions to the newly created under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs at the U.S. Department of State and the now independent agency, the International Broadcasting Bureau. USIA&#x27;s broadcasting functions were moved to the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which had been created in 1994.

Since the merger of USIA with the Department of State, public diplomacy and public affairs sections at U.S. missions have carried on this work. When USIA was abolished in 1999, USIS posts once again were operated by the Department of State.

Former USIA director of TV and film service Alvin Snyder recalled in his 1995 memoir that &quot;the U.S. government ran a full-service public relations organization, the largest in the world, about the size of the twenty biggest U.S. commercial PR firms combined. Its full-time professional staff of more than 10,000, spread out among some 150 countries, burnished America‘s image and trashed the Soviet Union 2,500 hours a week with a &#x27;tower of babble&#x27; more than 70 languages, to the tune of over $2 billion per year&quot;. The USIA was &quot;the biggest branch of this propaganda machine.&quot;

==Stated mission==

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the United States Information Agency on August 1, 1953, during the postwar tensions with the communist world known as the Cold War. The USIA&#x27;s mission was &quot;to understand, inform and influence foreign publics in promotion of the national interest, and to broaden the dialogue between Americans and U.S. institutions, and their counterparts abroad&quot;. The USIA was established &quot;to streamline the U.S. government&#x27;s overseas information programs, and make them more effective&quot;. It operated all of the foreign information activities formerly carried out by the Department of State&#x27;s International Information Administration and Technical Cooperation Administration, as well as the Mutual Security Agency. USIA was also responsible for the overseas administration of the exchange of persons program formerly conducted by IIA. The USIA was the largest full-service public relations organization in the world, spending over $2 billion per year to highlight the views of the U.S. while diminishing those of the Soviet Union, through about 150 different countries.

Its stated goals were to explain and advocate U.S. policies in terms that are credible and meaningful in foreign cultures; to provide information about the official policies of the United States, and about the people, values and institutions which influence those policies; to bring the benefits of international engagement to American citizens and institutions by helping them build strong long-term relationships with their counterparts overseas; and to advise the President and U.S. government policy-makers on the ways in which foreign attitudes would have a direct bearing on the effectiveness of U.S. policies. The Department of State provided foreign policy guidance.

During the Cold War, some American officials believed that a propaganda program was essential to convey the United States and its culture and politics to the world, and to offset negative Soviet propaganda against the US. With heightened fears about the influence of communism, some Americans believed that the films produced by the Hollywood movie industry, when critical of American society, damaged its image in other countries. The USIA &quot;exist[ed] as much to provide a view of the world to the United States as it [did] to give the world a view of America&quot;. Films produced by the USIA could by law not be screened publicly within the United States due to the Smith–Mundt Act. This restriction also meant that Americans could not view the material even for study at the National Archives.

Within the US, the USIA was intended to assure Americans that &quot;[t]he United States was working for a better world&quot;. Abroad, the USIA tried to preserve a positive image of the U.S. regardless of negative depictions from communist propaganda. One notable example was Project Pedro. This secretly funded project created newsreels in Mexico during the 1950s that portrayed Communism unfavorably and the United States positively. Articles reflecting the views promoted by the USIA were frequently published under fictitious bylines, such as &quot;Guy Sims Fitch&quot;.

The agency regularly conducted research on foreign public opinion about the United States and its policies, in order to inform the president and other key policymakers. It conducted public opinion surveys throughout the world. It issued a variety of reports to government officials, including a twice-daily report on foreign media commentary around the world.

==Media and divisions==

From the beginning, President Dwight Eisenhower said that &quot;audiences would be more receptive to the American message if they were kept from identifying it as propaganda. Avowedly propagandistic materials from the United States might convince few, but the same viewpoints presented by the seemingly independent voices would be more persuasive.&quot; The USIA used various forms of media, including &quot;personal contact, radio broadcasting, libraries, book publication and distribution, press motion pictures, television, exhibits, English-language instruction, and others&quot;. Through these different forms, the United States government distributed its materials more easily and engaged a greater concentration of people.

Four main divisions were established when the USIA began its programs.
* Broadcasting information
* Libraries and exhibits
* Press services
* Motion picture service

The first division dealt with broadcasting information, both in the United States and around the world. The radio was one of the most widely used forms of media at the onset of the Cold War, as television was not widely available. The Smith–Mundt Act authorized information programs, including Voice of America. Voice of America was intended as an unbiased and balanced &quot;Voice from America&quot;, as originally broadcast during World War II. The VOA was used to &quot;tell America&#x27;s stories ... to information deprived listeners behind the Iron Curtain&quot;. By 1967, the VOA was broadcasting in 38 languages to up to 26 million listeners. In 1976 VOA gained its &quot;Charter&quot;, requiring its news to be balanced.

The second division of the USIA consisted of libraries and exhibits. The Smith–Mundt Act and the Fulbright–Hays Act of 1961 both authorized international cultural and educational exchanges (including the Fulbright Scholarship Program). USIA would mount exhibitions in its libraries overseas to reach people in other countries. &quot;Fulbrighters&quot; were grant recipients under the USIA educational and cultural exchange program. To ensure that those grant programs would be fair and unbiased, persons of educational and cultural expertise in the grant subject areas selected the grantee recipients.

The USIA&#x27;s third division included press services. Within its first two decades, the &quot;USIA publishe[d] sixty-six magazines, newspapers, and other periodicals, totaling almost 30 million copies annually, in twenty-eight languages&quot;.

The fourth division dealt with the motion picture service. After the USIA failed in its effort to collaborate with Hollywood filmmakers to portray America in a positive light, the agency began producing their own documentaries.

=== Non-broadcast educational and information efforts ===
By the time the agency was reorganized in 1999, the educational and informational efforts encompassed a wide range of activities, outside of broadcasting. These were focused in four areas, the agency produced extensive electronic and printed materials.
* Information service
* Speakers and Specialists Program
* Information Resource Centers
* Foreign press centers

Its &quot;The Washington File&quot; information service, was intended to provide, in the words of the agency &quot;both time-sensitive and in-depth information in five languages&quot;, incorporating full transcripts of speeches, Congressional testimony, articles by Administration officials, and materials providing analysis of key issues. The Agency also ran a number of websites to transmit information.

Second, the agency ran a &quot;Speakers and Specialists Program&quot;, sending Americans abroad for various public speaking and technical assistance roles. These speakers were referred to as &quot;American Participants&quot; or &quot;AmParts&quot;.

Third, the agency operated more than 100 &quot;Information Resource Centers&quot; abroad. These included some public-access libraries in developing countries.

Finally, the USIA-operated foreign press centers in Washington, New York, and Los Angeles to &quot;assist resident and visiting foreign journalists&quot;. In other major American cities, such as Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, Miami, and Seattle, the USIA worked cooperatively with other international press centers.

Beginning with the 1958 Brussels World Fair, the USIA directed the design, construction, and operation of the U.S. pavilions representing the United States at major world Expos.

==Abolition and restructuring==
The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Division G of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, , abolished the U.S. Information Agency effective October 1, 1999. Its information and cultural exchange functions were folded into the Department of State under the newly created Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.

When dismantled, the agency budget was $1.109 billion. After reductions of staff in 1997, the agency had 6,352 employees, of which almost half were civil service employees in the United States (2,521). About 1,800 of these employees worked in international broadcasting, while approximately 1,100 worked on the agency&#x27;s educational and informational programs, such as the Fulbright program. Foreign service officers consisting of about 1,000 members of the work force. Broadcasting functions, including Voice of America, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free Europe (in Eastern Europe), Radio Free Asia, and Radio Liberty (in Russia and other areas of the former Soviet Union), were consolidated as an independent entity under the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). This continues to operate independently from the State Department. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, some commentators characterized United States international broadcasters, such as Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe, and Voice of America as United States propaganda.

<doc id="195603" wikidata="Q7561583" url="?curid=195603" title="Songs of a Dead Dreamer">
<text>Songs of a Dead Dreamer is a 1986 horror short story collection by American writer Thomas Ligotti. It has been acknowledged as one of the seminal collections of modern weird horror fiction by Ligotti&#x27;s peers, such as Ramsey Campbell. Many of its stories show the influence of Ligotti&#x27;s literary idols of horror such as H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe.

==Editorial history==
The first edition of Ligotti&#x27;s book was produced in paperback by Silver Scarab Press, limited to 300 copies. It was re-released in an expanded and revised edition in 1989 by Carroll and Graf. Both editions of the book contain an introduction by Ramsey Campbell. In 2010, Subterranean Press republished the book with author revisions, making it the definitive edition.

==Film==
The serial killer story &quot;The Frolic&quot; was filmed in 2007 (directed by Jacob Cooney, based on a screenplay co-authored by Brandon Trenz and Ligotti). Wonder Entertainment has released &quot;The Frolic Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD and Book&quot; set, which contains the short film adaptation of the story, and also commentary tracks and behind-the-scenes by Cooney, producer Jane Kelly Kosek, and actor Maury Sterling; a new interview with screenwriters Ligotti and Trenz; a newly revised version of the short story, with a new introduction by Ligotti; and the screenplay, with a new introduction by Trenz. Only 1,000 copies of the collector&#x27;s edition were released. The book containing the revised text of &quot;The Frolic,&quot; was exclusive to this set.

==In popular culture==
*DJ Spooky&#x27;s 1996 album of the same name was inspired by the collection.

<text>Pavel Ivanovich Belyayev (; 26 June 1925 – 10 January 1970) was a Soviet cosmonaut who commanded the historic 1965 Voskhod 2 space mission which saw the first space walk. He had been a fighter pilot with extensive experience in piloting different types of aircraft, and was the first commander of the cosmonaut corps.

==Early life==
Pavel Belyayev was one of 6 children and was known as &quot;Pasha&quot; to his family and friends. He was born on 26 June 1925, in Chelishchevo, now Babushkinsky District, Vologda Oblast, Russia. In 1932 his family moved to the nearby village of Minkovo. His father was a physician&#x27;s assistant and his mother worked on a collective farm. Belyayev began his schooling at the age of 7 in 1932. Physics and geography were his favourite subjects. As a boy he enjoyed playing hockey and hunting. Just before his 13th birthday the family moved to Kamensk-Uralsky region. He continued his education at the Gorkogo secondary school.

In 1942, Belyayev took on temporary work as a turner in a factory and later became a check operator in the Sinarsk pipes factory in support of the war effort. He applied to the special air force school in Sverdlovsk but failed to gain admission. He then attempted to join a fighting ski unit as a volunteer, but was again rejected because he was too young. In 1943, just prior to turning 18, he was called up. He then entered the 3rd Sarapul School where he began training as a naval pilot. He graduated in 1944 and then moved to the Stalin Naval Air School.

==Air Force career==
Belyayev graduated as a military pilot in 1945 with the rank of junior lieutenant. The war had ended in the west, so Belyayev was sent to defend Russia&#x27;s eastern regions. He flew Yakovlev, Lavochkin and MiG fighters in the final days of the war against the Japanese, August 1945. 

Belyayev remained in the East for the next decade, being stationed largely in Siberia. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1947. In 1950 he was promoted to senior lieutenant. During this time he flew seven different aircraft types and came to be considered one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most gifted commander pilots. He was awarded the Distinguished Combat service medal in 1953. In 1954 he was promoted to captain. While he remained fond of hunting, he also enjoyed more academic pursuits in his downtime including reading and writing poetry and playing the piano and accordion. In 1956 Belyayev succeeded in gaining entry into advanced studies at the Red Banner Air Force Academy. He graduated in 1959 as military pilot second class and with the rank of major.

==Cosmonaut selection==
During Belyayev&#x27;s final studies at the Red banner Air Force Academy he had been interviewed and tested for possible inclusion in the space program. The selectors were impressed by his ability to withstand high g-Forces. Belyayev was sent to Air Squadron 661 4th IAD of the Black Sea Fleet. A month later he was appointed commander of the regiment&#x27;s 241st squadron. By the time he was finally selected he had logged over 1,000 hours flight time in both piston and jet aircraft and had also completed approximately 40 parachute jumps.
Belyayev reported for assignment at the newly formed TsPK (cosmonaut training centre) on 25 March 1960. At 34, he was the oldest candidate accepted into the program. As a major he was the highest ranking candidate and the only one to have seen active service in World War II. Because of his senior rank, Belyayev became the first commander of the cosmonaut corps. Belyayev and Vladimir Komarov (2 years Belyayev&#x27;s junior) were the only candidates to have Air Force Academy training. Yuri Gagarin nicknamed the two senior officers &quot;The Professors&quot;

In August 1960, Belyayev fractured his lower leg just above the ankle in parachute training, an accident that delayed his progress by approximately 12 months and excluded him from any early space flights. Due to the severity of the injury, it seemed unlikely that Belyayev would be readmitted to the program, but he worked constantly to recover and regain his fitness. After a year&#x27;s absence he passed his medical and returned to training.

==Space flight==
After the success of the first Voskhod mission in 1964, a second more technically demanding mission was planned for 1965. Its primary aim was to have a cosmonaut leave the capsule and &quot;space-walk&quot;. Belyayev was confirmed as prime crew commander of Voskhod 2 just 3 days prior to launch. There had been concern about his mission fitness following a poor performance in the altitude chamber testing 2 months before. It was his crewman Alexei Leonov who finally reported that &quot;Those responsible for the malfunction were the factory specialists supporting the equipment&quot;, and that Belyayev had successfully corrected the fault himself, thereby also taking responsibility for the problem himself. Leonov, who had been chosen to perform the space walk described how he preferred to have Belyayev as his mission commander over Khrunov. &quot;I lobbied hard for Pasha, whom I thought more capable than Khrunov. I had worked with him more; I trusted him.&quot;

===Voskhod 2===
Voskhod 2 launched with Belyayev and Leonov on board on 18 March 1965. Belyayev&#x27;s call sign was &quot;Diamond&quot; (Russian: Алмаз) and his designation as mission commander was 1.

After Leonov successfully performed the first space walk, Belyayev prepared to return to Earth. Belyayev had to perform a manual reentry when the automatic reentry system failed. This required Belyayev to use the equipped Vzor navigation device to orient the capsule. Due to the cramped conditions inside the capsule and its poor design, Belyayev had to lie across the seats to use the Vzor while Leonov held him in place. Belyayev asked Leonov to check the craft&#x27;s attitude, a move which caused the craft to overshoot its intended landing area by approximately because of the extra time this took. Upon landing Belyayev had to force open the hatch after the explosive bolts failed to open it. Belyayev then had to pull Leonov, whose legs had become jammed under the TV screen console, out of the capsule. After spending a night back inside the capsule in extremely cold conditions, the crew were met by an advance rescue party the following morning. It took another day to clear a spot in the forest for a rescue helicopter to land from the landing site.

After the success of the mission Belyayev and Leonov were awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal, given 15,000 rubles, a Volga car and 45 days leave.

Apollo 15 commander, astronaut David Scott recalled meeting Belyayev at the 1967 Paris Air Show, when he and other NASA representatives visited the Russian pavilion. &quot;He was really gracious… Belyayev was a very positive, thoughtful guy, a real leader; I liked him a lot.&quot; On a reciprocal visit to the American pavilion, Belyayev disclosed that he had been &quot;the first cosmonaut to bring his mission back to Earth on manual control&quot;.

He was originally to fly the Vostok 8 mission into Earth&#x27;s Van Allen radiation belt, but this was cancelled.

==Personal life==
In 1948, he married Tatyana Filippovna Prikazchikova. They had two daughters; Irina and Ludmila.

==Death and legacy==
Belyayev died five years after the Voskhod 2 mission in 1970 from peritonitis that resulted from an operation on a stomach ulcer. He is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

Belyayev has been commemorated with other prominent figures from the early Russian space program with a bust on Cosmonauts Alley in Moscow. Pavel Belyayev was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union (23 March 1965), Order of Lenin, Order of the Red Star, numerous medals and foreign orders. He also bore the title of the Hero of Socialist Labor of Bulgaria, Hero of Vietnam, and Hero of Mongolia.

His name appears on the plaque accompanying the &quot;Fallen Astronaut&quot; sculpture placed on the Moon on 1 August 1971 by the crew of Apollo 15.

Accounts of Belyayev&#x27;s life and space career appear in the 2003 book &quot;Fallen Astronauts&quot; and the 2007 book &quot;Into That Silent Sea&quot;, both by Colin Burgess. Belyayev is also used as a character in Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens 2005 novel, &quot;Freefall&quot;, in which he is the first person to land on the Moon, hours before Apollo 11.

Pavel Belyayev appeared on various stamps. In 1965, he appeared on stamps from the Soviet Union, Cuba, Bulgaria, East Germany, and Hungary. In 1966, he appeared on stamps from Bulgaria, Mali, and Mauritania.

A crater on the far side of the Moon was named after Belyayev by the IAU in 1970.

A minor planet discovered in 1969 by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh is named 2030 Belyaev after him.

Konstantin Khabensky portrayed Belyayev in the 2017 Russian film &quot;The Age of Pioneers&quot;, a dramatisation of the Voskhod 2 mission. Leonov acted as creative consultant and the film is dedicated to Belyayev.

<doc id="195610" wikidata="Q918613" url="?curid=195610" title="Raw Power">
<text>Raw Power is the third studio album by American rock band the Stooges (credited as Iggy and the Stooges), released on February 7, 1973 by Columbia Records. The album departed from the &quot;groove-ridden, feel-based songs&quot; of the band&#x27;s first two records in favor of a more anthemic hard rock approach inspired by new guitarist James Williamson, who co-wrote the album&#x27;s eight songs with singer Iggy Pop. Pop produced the recording sessions himself and David Bowie assisted with post-production work, though the team were allotted only one day to mix the album and the resulting fidelity was poor. Later reissues have attempted to either correct or enhance the original mix, most notably Pop&#x27;s 1997 remix, which became notorious for its extreme volume and compression.

Though not initially commercially successful, &quot;Raw Power&quot; gained a cult following in the years following its release and, like its predecessors &quot;The Stooges&quot; (1969) and &quot;Fun House&quot; (1970), is considered a forerunner of punk rock. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;it has since been acknowledged as one of the most influential records in rock history&quot;. Williamson&#x27;s raw guitar sound deeply influenced acts of different music genres such as the Sex Pistols, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana.

== Background ==
After their first two albums &quot;The Stooges&quot; (1969) and &quot;Fun House&quot; (1970) were released to little commercial success, the Stooges were in disarray: the band had officially broken up, bassist Dave Alexander was fighting alcoholism, and singer Iggy Pop&#x27;s heroin addiction was escalating prior to the intervention of David Bowie. Pop later recalled, &quot;Very few people recognized the quality of the Stooges&#x27; songwriting, it was really meticulous. And to his credit, the only person I&#x27;d ever known of in print to notice it, among my peers of professional musicians, was Bowie. He noticed it right off.&quot; Having signed on as a solo artist to Columbia Records, Pop relocated to London, where he was to write and record an album with James Williamson, who served as the Stooges&#x27; second guitarist from November 1970 until the band&#x27;s initial dissolution in July 1971. When they failed to find a suitable English rhythm section, Williamson suggested that former Stooges Ron Asheton and Scott Asheton fly over and participate in the recording sessions, leading to the band&#x27;s reformation under the new name of &quot;Iggy and the Stooges&quot;. Although he was the band&#x27;s founding guitarist, the elder Asheton reluctantly agreed to switch to electric bass.

== Recording ==
Initial demo sessions were held at RG Jones Recording Studios in Wimbledon with sound engineer Gerry Kitchingham and at Olympic Studios in Barnes with sound engineer Keith Harwood, with most of the songs rejected by the band&#x27;s management. Pop said that Columbia executives insisted on two ballads, one for each side of the album: &quot;Gimme Danger&quot; and &quot;I Need Somebody&quot;. The album itself was recorded at CBS Studios in London with staff engineer Mike Ross-Trevor from September 10 to October 6, 1972. Pop produced and mixed the album by himself; unfortunately, his botched first attempt mixed most of the instruments into one stereo channel and the vocals into the other, with little regard for balance or tone quality. Tony Defries, the head of Bowie&#x27;s management company MainMan, informed Pop that the album would be remixed by Bowie. Pop agreed to this, saying that &quot;the other choice was I wasn&#x27;t going to get my album out. I think Defries told me that CBS refused to release it like that, I don&#x27;t know&quot;, but insisted that his own mix for &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; be retained. Due to budgetary constraints, Bowie remixed the other seven songs in a single day at Los Angeles&#x27; Western Sound Recorders in October 1972. Pop said of the production:
Bowie later recalled:
When Morgan Neville&#x27;s documentary film on &quot;Raw Power&quot; was released in 2010, they demonstrated that each individual instrument was indeed recorded on its own track on the original multi-track tapes, suggesting that Bowie was either mistaken or working with a copy that had mixed down the instruments on to the same track.

=== Alternate mixes ===
Low-fidelity copies of Pop&#x27;s original mixes circulated among fans for years. In 1993, a selection of these original mixes was released by Bomp Records as &quot;Rough Power&quot;. Fans and critics generally agreed that the original mixes were interesting, but not necessarily superior to Bowie&#x27;s efforts. Of the &quot;Rough Power&quot; release, Pop has remarked that &quot;what David and I came up with at these sessions was better than that.&quot;

In 1996, Columbia Records &quot;invited&quot; Pop to remix the entire album for re-release on CD. Pop said in the liner notes that had he declined, the studio would have remixed it without his blessing. Pop cited longtime encouragement from fans and peers, the existence of &quot;Rough Power&quot;, his distaste for how the original 1989 CD release of &quot;Raw Power&quot; sounded, and the fact that Columbia would release the new mix on its subsidiary Legacy Recordings as factors that led him to go through with the new mix, which was undertaken at New York&#x27;s Sony Music Studios in 1996. The remixed edition was released on April 22, 1997. In the album&#x27;s accompanying liner notes, Pop states the following:
American music journalist and essayist Robert Christgau wrote approvingly of Pop&#x27;s &quot;Raw Power&quot; remix. Upon reviewing the 1997 edition of &quot;Raw Power&quot;, Christgau – who in the past had complained about how Bowie had mixed the original album &quot;down till it&#x27;s thin as an epicure&#x27;s wrist&quot; and inflicted &quot;ruinous underbassing&quot; – wrote, 

On the other hand, some fans – among them guitarist Robert Quine – felt that the new remix was as unfaithful to the material as the original 1973 mix, and further criticized the audible distortion in the new mix. Quine said, &quot;[Iggy&#x27;s] one of the greats but I wonder about what he did to that record with the new [&quot;Raw Power&quot;] remix, which is atrocious. &#x27;With this remix, I think this can stand up with the latest Smashing Pumpkins.&#x27; Wow.&quot; In the reissued CD&#x27;s liner notes, however, Pop points out that one of his intentions in doing the new mix was to keep audio levels in the red (which would deliberately cause such distortion) while at the same time making the music more &quot;powerful and listenable&quot;. This new version is arguably the &quot;loudest album ever&quot;, reaching RMS of -4 dB, rare even by today&#x27;s standards.

James Williamson and Ron Asheton have both stated that they prefer Bowie&#x27;s original mix of the album over Pop&#x27;s remixed version. Williamson stated:
Asheton stated:
In 2002, Bowie said that his original mix of &quot;Raw Power&quot; is &quot;the version I still prefer over the later remix – it has more wound-up ferocity and chaos and, in my humble opinion, is a hallmark roots sound for what was later to become punk.&quot; 

In 2010, Pop remarked,

Pop and Bowie&#x27;s mixes were both remastered in 2012 for a Record Store Day double LP by Kevin Gray and Mark Wilder, respectively; this remastering was free of clipping.

In 2023, both mixes of the album were once again remastered, free of clipping, along with the release of a new edition of the album to commemorate its fiftieth anniversary.

== Musical style ==
&quot;Raw Power&quot; has often been classified as a proto-punk or garage rock album. According to Brett Callwood, it abandoned the &quot;groove-ridden, feel-based songs&quot; of the band&#x27;s first two albums in favor of a more anthemic hard rock approach inspired by Williamson, who co-wrote the album&#x27;s eight songs with Pop. Similarly, music critic Joe S. Harrington said that the hard rock album demonstrated a &quot;totally overpowering&quot; sound, &quot;a sledgehammer attack of brutal ill will&quot;, while author Dave Thompson noted Pop&#x27;s &quot;nihilistic hard rock bellowing&quot; throughout. In another analysis, &quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Iain Ellis said the album can be seen in retrospect as punk metal, while &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot;″s Jarret Keene deemed it &quot;garage-punk-metal&quot; fusion.

== Marketing and sales ==

&quot;Raw Power&quot; was released on February 7, 1973 under the moniker of &quot;Iggy and the Stooges&quot;, in contrast to the band&#x27;s first two albums, which were credited to &quot;the Stooges&quot;. The cover is a photograph of Pop taken by rock music photographer Mick Rock. The songs &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; and &quot;Shake Appeal&quot; were both released as singles (the title track was released as a single in Japan only). According to Robert Hilburn, the album was &quot;far too radical for the corporate-rock sensibilities of radio&quot; in 1973, and as a result it only charted for three weeks on the Top 200, peaking at number 183. The group continued touring for about a year, but Columbia dropped their contract. The Stooges were also dumped by MainMan – Tony Defries lost patience with the band after the large sum of money he advanced to them was spent on drugs. The Stooges broke up in February 1974. After spending time in a drug-fueled stupor in L.A. – and later rehab at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute – Pop re-joined Bowie&#x27;s entourage, and emerged as a solo artist in 1976.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Raw Power&quot; received much praise from contemporary critics. Dave Marsh proclaimed that it was already &quot;the best album of the &#x27;70s&quot;, as Pop had &quot;summed everything up and it took him only nine songs to do it.&quot; Ben Edmunds from &quot;Phonograph Record&quot; called it &quot;an experience so overpowering that it forces new definitions for even the most familiar things&quot;, arguing in March that it will undoubtedly be the album of the year. According to Lester Bangs, the &quot;by-now banal words &#x27;heavy metal&#x27; were invested for this group&quot;, while &quot;the ferocious assertiveness of the lyrics is at once slightly absurd and indicative of a confused, violently defensive stance that&#x27;s been a rock tradition from the beginning&quot;. In &quot;Stereo Review&quot;, he called the album a &quot;comeback of major proportions&quot; and &quot;monomaniacal fury so genuine&quot; that it may be too overwhelming for listeners, concluding that, &quot;whether you laugh at them or accept their chaotic rumble on its own terms, they&#x27;re fascinating and authentic, the apotheosis of every parental nightmare.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Raw Power&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lenny Kaye praised its uncompromising music and said, &quot;for the first time, the Stooges have used the recording studio as more than a recapturing of their live show, and with David Bowie helping out in the mix, there is an ongoing swirl of sound that virtually drags you into the speakers&quot;. Longtime Stooges fans were less receptive to Bowie&#x27;s mix for the original album; Robert Christgau later wrote of the original fan response, &quot;first-generation Iggyphiles charged just as indignantly that David Bowie had mixed the real thing way too thin, before it was anointed the Platonic idea of rock and roll by desperate young men who didn&#x27;t have much else to choose from&quot;.

Along with the Stooges&#x27; first two albums, &quot;Raw Power&quot; came to be regarded as an important proto-punk record in the years following its release. Writing of the album in retrospect, Will Hodgkinson believed that while the band&#x27;s debut was &quot;charged and brutal garage-rock&quot; and &quot;Fun House&quot; was &quot;lurid chaos&quot;, &quot;Raw Power&quot; was more musically sophisticated &quot;in its debauchery&quot;. In &quot;The Trouser Press Guide to New Wave Records&quot;, Scott Isler credited Williamson&#x27;s writing contributions with providing more musicality and structure to the band&#x27;s songs, whose lyrics conflated sex and death. He regarded the album as &quot;heavy metal in every sense&quot; and &quot;another masterpiece&quot; from the group. Greg Kot also believed &quot;Raw Power&quot; was &quot;another masterpiece-more heavy metal than punk&quot;, with songs more &quot;structured but no less forceful&quot;. Nick Kent said in 2010 that &quot;Raw Power&quot; remains &quot;the greatest, meanest-eyed, coldest-blooded hard rock tour de force ever summoned up in a recording studio&quot;. Christgau was somewhat less impressed. In his 1981 book &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot;, he praised Williamson&#x27;s guitar playing while writing that the side-opening tracks &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; and the title song &quot;voice the Iggy Pop ethos more insanely (and aggressively) than &#x27;I Wanna Be Your Dog&#x27;&quot;, but felt that &quot;the rest disperses in their wake&quot; and that Bowie had mixed the record too thinly.

&quot;Raw Power&quot; has appeared on professional listings of the greatest albums. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it the 83rd best album of the 1970s. In 2003, it was ranked number 125 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list, and 128 in a 2012 revised list.

=== 1997 remix ===

&quot;Raw Power&quot;″s 1997 remix also received positive reviews. Writing that year in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne believed it rectified &quot;one of rock&#x27;s most exciting, but worst-recorded, audio assaults&quot;, and found it &quot;as collar grabbing as the Stooges&#x27; skin-scratching rage itself&quot;, improving upon past releases of the album, in which &quot;the guitars were too loud, [and] the drums buried.&quot; Hilburn gave the remix a rave review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, writing that it &quot;simply presents greater instrumental clarity and definition&quot; than previous mixes and concluded, &quot;It may have taken all these years to get the album right, but it has finally arrived.&quot; Tim Stegall from &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said while the original mix &quot;was so muted that it sounded like Vietnam being fought inside a Kleenex box&quot;, the remix is comparable to an atomic bombing and, &quot;with its sonic gonads now fully restored, it can be further stated &quot;Raw Power&quot; is the single most dangerous rock &amp; roll album ever made. Before or since.&quot; Christgau remained qualified in his praise. Reviewing the reissue in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, he said &quot;the pumped bass and vocals Iggy has uncovered on the original tapes&quot; to be a &quot;quantum improvement&quot; over the original mix, but still found fault with the slower songs, &quot;which like all of Iggy&#x27;s slow ones are not as good as his fast ones, stand between a statement of principle and a priceless work of art.&quot; Nonetheless, he ranked it as the ninth best reissue of the year in his list for the 1997 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot; journalist Stuart Berman, Pop&#x27;s remix of &quot;Raw Power&quot; &quot;horrified audiophiles with a distaste for digital distortion&quot;. Christgau observed, &quot;strict constructionists and lo-fi snobs charge indignantly that by remixing his own album Iggy has made a mockery of history and done irreparable damage to a priceless work of art.&quot; In Berman&#x27;s opinion, &quot;after spending the past 13 years having my ears ravaged by the &#x27;97 Iggy mix, I find it difficult readjusting to the leaner, original version—even with the remastering, the &#x27;97 version far outstrips it in fidelity and sheer brute force, and remains a better entry point for younger listeners seeking to understand the album&#x27;s impact.&quot;

== Legacy and influence ==
&quot;Raw Power&quot; has been credited by many sources for pioneering punk rock, although &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s Lizzie Manno adds that it has &quot;also been cited as a major influence on heavy metal and hard rock&quot;. According to Ted Maider of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, &quot;Raw Power&quot; is &quot;by far the most important punk record ever&quot;, while &quot;Diffuser.fm&quot; writer James Stafford said, &quot;One can make a reasonable argument for whether &quot;Raw Power&quot; or its predecessor, &quot;Fun House&quot;, lays claim to &#x27;first punk record&#x27; status.&quot; &quot;DIY&quot;″s Jonathan Hatchman wrote, &quot;Above all, the reason that &quot;Raw Power&quot; should be regarded as, at least, one of the greatest punk albums of all time, is the influence it has provided. Without it, punk may have never even happened.&quot;

Steve Jones from the Sex Pistols once said that he learned to play guitar by taking speed and playing along to &quot;Raw Power&quot;. Johnny Marr of the Smiths cited it as his all-time favorite record: &quot;It gave me a path to follow as a guitar player. It was an opening into a world of rock &amp; roll, sleaze, sexuality, drugs, violence and danger. That&#x27;s a hard combination to beat&quot;. He also commented on Williamson&#x27;s guitar playing on the album: &quot;I&#x27;m his biggest fan. He has the technical ability of Jimmy Page without being as studious, and the swagger of Keith Richards without being sloppy. He&#x27;s both demonic and intellectual, almost how you would imagine Darth Vader to sound if he was in a band.&quot; Marr added that he considered Pop &quot;the greatest rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll singer of all time&quot;. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth said that it was one of the albums that shaped his life and music: &quot;That record sliced my head off. The aggression and psychosexual imagery were really mysterious and alluring. In a way, it brought me into all those other aspects of music and literature that were really intriguing, like William S. Burroughs and the Beat Generation.&quot;

Singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain of Nirvana wrote in his &quot;Journals&quot; numerous times that &quot;Raw Power&quot; was his favorite album of all time. It tops a list of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana&#x27;s sound, as entered in his journal in 1993. Henry Rollins of Black Flag has &quot;Search &amp; Destroy&quot; tattooed across his shoulder blades. He said that &quot;Raw Power&quot; is his second favorite Stooges album (after &quot;Fun House&quot;), calling it &quot;America&#x27;s greatest contribution to the hard rock scene&quot;, to compete with the &quot;Stones, Zeppelins and the Deep Purples&quot;. Former Smiths frontman Morrissey once described &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; as &quot;great&quot; and &quot;a very LA song&quot;. Mötley Crüe founder Nikki Sixx has cited it as a major influence: &quot;When I was fifteen years old, I remember Iggy and the Stooges&#x27; song &#x27;Search and Destroy&#x27; reaching out from my speakers to me like my own personal anthem.&quot; &quot;I got into the heavier guitar stuff I was going through that adolescent anger thing. It&#x27;s a common story but mine was also fuelled by a father and a mother that were gone, and not really knowing where I fit into society. That song really connected with me&quot;. Guitarist John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers also praised the record: &quot;When you think about all the ways bands these days try and expand rock and roll, most of them look pretty silly next to &quot;Raw Power&quot;. That is a definitive statement&quot;. CeeLo Green cited &quot;Raw Power&quot; as one of his favorite albums, stating that it &quot;seems like it&#x27;s all done in one take. &#x27;Let&#x27;s do that one, leave it, just try something else&#x27;. With his energy on stage, it seems as if the studio was just destroyed after that album – or at least you&#x27;d like to believe that&quot;.

The album&#x27;s songs have been frequently covered. Prominent versions include the Dictators&#x27;, Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27;, Dead Boys&#x27;, Shotgun Messiah&#x27;s, and Def Leppard&#x27;s covers of &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; and Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; cover of the title track on &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;. &quot;Iggy is so easygoing and so unpretentious, he didn&#x27;t care whether we did it or not,&quot; remarked GNR guitarist Slash. &quot;He just likes the fact that we thought of that tune.&quot;

Ewan McGregor covered &quot;Gimme Danger&quot; for the film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, which tells the story of a character based on Bowie&#x27;s Ziggy Stardust during the 1970s glam rock era. 

&quot;Gimme Danger&quot; was also covered by Pixies frontman Frank Black for the game &quot;Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2&quot;. A cover of &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; by Emanuel also appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;. Additionally, a cover of the album&#x27;s namesake track &quot;Raw Power&quot; was performed by Romeo Delta in &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot;.

In May 2010, Pop, Williamson, Mike Watt, Scott Asheton, and Steve Mackay performed &quot;Raw Power&quot; in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series.

<text>Trionfo di Afrodite (Italian for &quot;Triumph of Aphrodite&quot;) is a cantata written in 1951 by the German composer Carl Orff. It is the third and final installment in the &quot;Trionfi&quot; musical triptych, which also includes &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; (1937) and &quot;Catulli Carmina&quot; (1943).

== Background ==

Described by the composer himself as a &quot;concerto scenico&quot; (scenic concert), the &quot;Trionfo&quot; is a representation of a ritual for a Greco-Roman wedding, in a similar fashion to Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Les noces&quot;. In this case, &quot;Trionfo&quot; refers to the Roman and Renaissance &quot;trionfo&quot;, meaning &quot;procession&quot; or &quot;festival&quot;. By using the word &quot;trionfo&quot;, Orff specifically intended to identify the work as a successor to the Renaissance and baroque tradition of the masque and pageant, not as a formal borrowing but as a rather refreshed and extended look on it.

Orff began working on the &quot;Trionfo&quot; as early as 1947, but could not fully concentrate on the piece until he completed his &quot;Antigonae&quot; in March 1949. The score was finally completed in 1951 and premiered some time later, on February 14, 1953, at La Scala in Milan, with Herbert von Karajan conducting. Originally published in 1952 by B. Schott&#x27;s Söhne, it was reprinted by the original publisher in 1980 and again in 1990 by Ernst Eulenburg.

=== Texts ===

The texts are based on Latin wedding poems by Catullus, as well as Greek poems by Sappho and a small part by Euripides. Catullus is Orff&#x27;s primary source of inspiration and guide in using both classical Latin and Greek text. Orff had already explored this in &quot;Catulli Carmina&quot; with Catullus&#x27;s Carmen 51, which is, in turn, an adaption of Sappho&#x27;s famous love poem 31. It is likely that it was the last call in &quot;Catulli Carmina&quot;″s &quot;Exodium&quot;, &quot;Accendite faces!&quot; (Light the torches!), that gave Orff the idea of using bridal torches in his new work and bringing the to its concluding climax, with a representation of a nuptial feast, as found in classical literature. Consequently, Orff decided to opt for Catullus&#x27;s and , which mainly focuses on the topic of the nuptial feast. Both of these poems were originally written as an offering on the occasion of a patrician Roman couple. However, these poems were not intended to be sung, but should rather act as depictions of the event of marriage as such. Orff&#x27;s intentions with the text were not to offer an ad hoc reconstruction of an antique rite, but rather to present the union of an &quot;archetypal couple as the work of the Goddess of Love Aphrodite, as a &quot;hieros gamos&quot;&quot; (holy marriage). In this sense, the subtitle of the work, , implies that there is a deliberate absence of plot, as opposed to the two preceding parts of the triptych.

Despite the large orchestra, the instrumentation is often sparse, especially in the Greek verses, and the music is strongly influenced by the rhythms and melodies of the spoken word, though little importance is actually given to both tonic and prosodic accent. The piece closes with a triumphant apparition of Aphrodite herself, a rare instance when the full choral and orchestral forces are actually used.

==Structure==
The work is divided into seven tableaux:
While texts are blended into the composition so that the sources seems homogeneous and transitions from one text to the other are not easy to spot, the music is different when different languages are used. Orff wanted to exploit the phonetic qualities of each language individually. Consequently, fragments in Latin are generally more rhythmical and serve as a stable background, while fragments in Ancient Greek form inlays with flexible and elaborate &quot;tessitura&quot;. The finale, taken from a different text, would be a combination of these two.

=== Description of the movements ===

The first &quot;tableau&quot;, with a tempo indication &quot; = ca. 84&quot;, is a self contained unit where is presented as an exposition of the wedding scene. It represents a singing contest between the young men and maidens, both separated in groups on stage but in full view of each other. The movement begins with the &quot;Vesper adest&quot; sung by the male coryphaeus, a short prelude that precedes the contest (verses 1–19), in which both groups of young men and maidens rehearse the song one last time. At verse 20 (and rehearsal number 4), an antiphonal song begins where the male (&quot;Hespere, quis caelo fertur crudelior ignis?&quot;) and female (&quot;Hespere, quis caelō lūcet iūcundior ignis?&quot;) coryphaeus in each group lead their respective groups. This continues until the shared finale in the last eight lines in the text (and rehearsal number 14) gives the victory to the men. The gleam of the Evening Star is represented both by the harp and piano glissandos at the beginning of the piece, at rehearsal numbers 4 and 6 (before the corifei entries) and the melisma sung by the corifea at rehearsal number 8.

The second and third &quot;tableaux&quot; are the two main Greek sections where the bridal procession takes place, culminating with the arrival of the bride and groom. They are both based on Sappho&#x27;s poems. However, since most of Sappho&#x27;s literary work is now lost, the individual fragments (see ) used in this composition are not laid in any particular order. &quot;Tableau&quot; II is marked &quot; = 112&quot; and features many time signature changes. It largely presents static heterogeneous sounds. &quot;Tableau&quot; 3, on the other hand, is marked by a much more expressive and cantabile style. With the indication &quot;Quasi lento&quot; in the score, it features various recitations from the bride and groom. Since the fragments are generally unrelated to one another, in the sense that they have been extracted from different places within the original text, the sequence of musical phrases do not represent a dialogue. Interlocutors never speak to each other in a direct sense, but rather recite their lines. The next subsection within the third &quot;tableau&quot; comes at rehearsal number 32, where the chorus is introduced (&quot;Ἔσπερε, πάντα φέρεις&quot; – Espere, panta phereis). This is followed by another subsection at number 34 performed by the bride and chorus (&quot;Παρθενία, παρθενία, ποῖ με λίποισ᾽ ἀποίχῃ&quot; – Parthenia, Parthenia, poi me lipois&#x27; apoichae), followed by another dialogue at number 36 (&quot;Κατθάνην δ᾽ἴμερος τις ἔχει με&quot; – Katthanaen d&#x27;imeros echei me), and finished by the last subsection at number 45 with the &quot;Εἰς ὰεί&quot; (Eis aei).

The fourth &quot;tableau&quot; is arguably the best known section of this work. Divided into two subsections, it is marked a steady &quot; = 132&quot;. Orff here returns to Catullus 61, verses 1–15 and 26–75. The second subsection is often named &quot;Inno all&#x27; Imeneo&quot;, though that title is not used in the score; it is, however, divided by a double bar line with the inscription &quot;attacca&quot;. It is marked &quot; = 120&quot; (&quot;Quis deus magis est amatis petendus amantibus?&quot;). After an initial prelude, the main theme is presented three times, the last one marked &quot;poco a poco più mosso&quot;: the first one at number 60 (&quot;Nil potest sine te Venus&quot;), the second at number 63 (&quot;Nulla quit sine te domus&quot;), and the third one at number 66 (&quot;Quae tuis careat sacris&quot;).

The fifth &quot;tableau&quot;, marked &quot;Un poco pesante&quot;, is divided into three sections. The first section depicts games and singing outside the bride&#x27;s house. It includes text from Catullus 61, verses 76–120, in abridged form. A second subsection within the first section is the one starting at number 73 (&quot;Flere desine, non tib&#x27;, Aurunculeia&quot;), which is repeated with variations at number 75 (&quot;Prodeas, nova nupta&quot;) and number 78 (&quot;O cubile, o cubile&quot;). The second section, from verses 121–190, shows the bride being led to the bridal chamber. Marked &quot;Allegro assai&quot;, it features a solo bass coryphaeus, with histrionics and exaggerated gestures, reciting the lines of the poem, with short interludes from the percussion and chorus. The central theme is presented in number 89 (&quot;Transfer omine cum bono limen aureolos pedes&quot;), a melody presented five times and followed by violas and cellos. The third and final section of this &quot;tableau&quot;, verses 191–210 and 230–235, is devoted to the singing outside the bridal chamber. The bass from the previous section recites a speech, sometimes sung, sometimes spoken, marked &quot;Libero assai&quot; in the score. The second subsection in the third section of this &quot;tableau&quot;, at number 97 (&quot;Ille pulveris Africi&quot;), is a slow-moving song performed by the percussion, pianos, harp, and some members of the string section, and sung by the whole chorus. Marked &quot;Con larghezza&quot; in the score, it ends with a short sentence by the solo bass, only to be repeated again, at number 102, this time with interjections from the bass throughout the rest of the piece. The piece slowly fades into silence and finishes with the whole choir shouting &quot;Exercete iuventam!&quot;.

The sixth &quot;tableau&quot;, the shortest one in this composition, starts with a glissando by the first piano and harp. Marked &quot;Sempre molto rubato&quot;, it features various surviving quotations from Sappho&#x27;s poems summarized, where the bride and groom are in the bridal chamber. Here, as in &quot;tableau&quot; III, the bride and groom do not speak directly to each other, but rather recite lines with references to superhuman powers. It ends after a two-octave interval played by the groom and a high-pitched cry by the bride.

The seventh and final &quot;tableau&quot;, marked &quot;Con ampiezza&quot;, is a very rhythmical section that employs the whole orchestra. A second subsection starts at number 109, marked &quot;Più lento, con molta passione&quot; (&quot;θέλγει δ᾽Ἔρως&quot; – Thelgei d&#x27;Eros). The piece ends after a very loud climax where most instruments play . In fact, the bells are required to be stricken with iron rods, the pianos have to play tone clusters with both open hands pressing white and black keys, and the whole choir is expected to give a &quot;grido altissimo&quot; (very loud cry). Two quick chords close the piece.

==Orchestra==
The work calls for a large orchestra with an enhanced percussion section, consisting of the following:

<doc id="195614" wikidata="Q15149878" url="?curid=195614" title="The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume One">
<text>The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume One is a 1965 album by the jazz musician Sun Ra. The back cover describes it as an &quot;album of compositions and arrangements by Sun Ra played by Sun Ra and his Solar Arkestra&quot;.

The album is an example of the radical break which Sun Ra&#x27;s music of that time had made with &quot;previous notions of melody or harmony&quot;. Although heavily percussive, the music also dispenses with a continuous beat; instead Ra&#x27;s music is reconstructed around &quot;interweaving compositional and improvisatory creative principles with programmatic affects&quot;.

The album was originally released as &quot;The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra&quot;, with a B/W sleeve designed by Ra himself. This was replaced with a new orange and red sleeve by Howard Bernstein &amp; Baby Jerry - showing Sun Ra with the third eye - and the appendage Vol. 1 added when &quot;The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume Two&quot; was released in 1966.

The album was re-released on CD by ZYX-Music (ESP 1014-2) in the 1990s.

Gene Tyranny describes the album in his review as

The astonishing sessions that went light years beyond &quot;free jazz&quot; improvisation to create a music of deeply felt explosive and gentle gesture made from sound itself without reference to previous notions of melody or harmony.
==Recording the album==
Marshall Allen described the recording of the album in John F Szwed&#x27;s biography of Sun Ra, &quot;Space Is The Place&quot;;

&quot;Sun Ra would go to the studio and he would play something, the bass would come in, and if he didn&#x27;t like it he&#x27;d stop it; and he&#x27;d give the drummer a particular rhythm, tell the bass he wanted not a &#x27;boom boom boom,&#x27; but something else, and then he&#x27;d begin to try out the horns, we&#x27;re all standing there wondering what&#x27;s next...
&quot;I just picked up the piccolo and worked with what was going on, what mood they set, or what feeling they had. A lot of things we&#x27;d be rehearsing and we did the wrong things and Sun Ra stopped the arrangement and changed it. Or he would change the person who was playing the particular solo, so that changes the arrangement. So the one that was soloing would get another part given to him personally. &#x27;Cos he knew people. He could understand what you could do better so he would fit that with what he would tell you.&quot; Marshall Allen

<doc id="195618" wikidata="Q1090876" url="?curid=195618" title="The Low End Theory">
<text>The Low End Theory is the second studio album by American hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, released on September 24, 1991, by Jive Records. Recording sessions for the album were held mostly at Battery Studios in New York City, from 1990 to 1991. The album was primarily produced by group member Q-Tip, with a minimalist sound that combines bass, drum breaks, and jazz samples, in a departure from the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; (1990). Lyrically, the album features social commentary, word play, humor, and interplay between Q-Tip and fellow member Phife Dawg.

Supported by the lead single &quot;Check the Rhime&quot;, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; debuted at number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Upon its release, the album&#x27;s commercial potential was doubted by music critics and Jive record executives. However, the release of two additional singles, &quot;Jazz (We&#x27;ve Got)&quot; and &quot;Scenario&quot;, brought further attention and popularity to the group. On February 19, 1992, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States, and on February 1, 1995, it was certified platinum by the RIAA, with shipments of one million copies.

In the years since its release, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; has garnered recognition from music critics and writers as a milestone in alternative hip-hop. The album is regarded as Phife Dawg&#x27;s breakout and is credited for helping launch rapper Busta Rhymes&#x27;s successful solo career. The album&#x27;s influence on artists in hip-hop, R&amp;B and other genres has been attributed to the group&#x27;s lyricism and Q-Tip&#x27;s production, which bridged the gap between jazz and hip-hop. The album is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of all time, appearing on many best album lists by music critics and writers. In 2020, it was ranked at number 43 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2022, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Background==
A month after the release of A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s debut album, &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot;, group member Phife Dawg learned that he was diabetic and considered leaving the group. After a discussion with fellow member Q-Tip, they agreed to increase his participation on their second album and to &quot;step it up in general as a group.&quot; Recording sessions for the second album began when sessions from &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot; kept creatively flowing. The group wanted to begin recording the album shortly after the completion of &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot;, for which they still had to tour and film music videos. Phife Dawg later recalled, &quot;Tip didn&#x27;t want to stop.&quot; The album&#x27;s title, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, referred to both the status of black men in society and bass frequencies in the music, while the album cover featured an altered photograph of a kneeling woman painted in Afrocentric colors.

During the recording sessions, the group fired their manager Kool DJ Red Alert and joined Russell Simmons&#x27;s Rush Artist Management, with Chris Lighty serving as their new manager. They also fired their lawyer, who was Red Alert&#x27;s manager, and faced a lawsuit as a result. Both moves created tension within the Native Tongues collective, which was never fully resolved. After switching managers, the group demanded more advances from Jive, who eventually extended their recording contract for one more album. However, the negotiations between the group and Jive lasted over a year and strained their relationship. These events created a disillusionment with the music industry among the group, which affected &quot;both material and approach&quot; on &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;.

==Recording==
The majority of the recording sessions took place at Battery Studios in Manhattan, from 1990 to 1991, where the songs were recorded on a Neve 8068 mixing console that had been used by John Lennon. Like &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot;, production on &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; was primarily handled by Q-Tip, while Ali Shaheed Muhammad provided DJ scratching and co-production. Skeff Anselm produced two songs, which were programmed at Jazzy Jay&#x27;s Studio in The Bronx. Producer Pete Rock created the original beat for the second single, &quot;Jazz (We&#x27;ve Got)&quot;, before it was recreated by Q-Tip, who credited Rock in the outro of the song.

Group member Jarobi White, who previously appeared on &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot;, had verses recorded for &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;. However, he left the group during the sessions to study culinary art and his verses did not make the final cut. The song &quot;Butter&quot; was originally supposed to feature a verse by Q-Tip, but Phife Dawg insisted on rapping solo on it, causing a brief argument. It essentially became a Phife Dawg solo record, with Q-Tip performing the chorus.

Two posse cuts were recorded: the third single &quot;Scenario&quot;, featuring Leaders of the New School, and &quot;Show Business&quot;, featuring Lord Jamar and Sadat X of Brand Nubian and Diamond D of D.I.T.C. The former had several versions recorded, one of which included Posdnous of De La Soul and Black Sheep, as well as Chris Lighty, Jarobi White and future Flipmode Squad rapper Rampage, while the latter was originally recorded as &quot;Georgie Porgie&quot;, but was rejected by Jive for being &quot;too homophobic&quot; before being rewritten.

Q-Tip had a cold during the recording process and did not want to sound congested on the album; because of this he wanted to re-record all of his vocals and began doing so before people told him he sounded &quot;fine&quot; and convinced him otherwise.

== Music ==

===Production===
&quot;The Low End Theory&quot; was one of the first records to fuse hip-hop with the laid-back atmosphere of jazz, particularly bebop and hard bop. The album&#x27;s minimalist sound is &quot;stripped to the essentials: vocals, drums, and bass.&quot; The bass drum and vocals emphasize the downbeat on every song. Q-Tip credited the production on N.W.A&#x27;s album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; as inspiration: &quot;what resonated was just that bottom, that bass and the drive of it.&quot;

The album is noted for its use of the double bass, &quot;crisp&quot; and &quot;live-sounding&quot; drum programming, and &quot;deftly placed samples or electric keyboards.&quot; In addition, the group was praised for its &quot;departure towards a live instrumental sound&quot; and for using &quot;jazz-infused samples with fat hardcore beats.&quot; Q-Tip often layered drum sounds on the album, using as many as three snare drums or bass drums to create a single sound. Similarly, &quot;Buggin&#x27; Out&quot; was the first song in which he layered two different drum breaks at once, which was uncommon at the time. The group hired double bassist Ron Carter for the song &quot;Verses from the Abstract&quot;. Q-Tip stated, &quot;We wanted that straight bass sound, and Ron Carter is one of the premier bassists of the century.&quot;

&quot;The Low End Theory&quot; is also regarded for its engineering. The mixing engineer, Bob Power, used several methods to remove &quot;surface noise, crackles, or pops&quot; from the samples, as the software at the time was unable to do so. He credited the group, saying, &quot;Until that point, when people used samples on records, it was pretty much one loop that played throughout. With &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;  ... Q-Tip and Ali Shaheed were at the leading edge of a new wave where people started making elaborate musical constructions out of samples from different places that would not, and in many ways, could not, have been played by regular players.&quot;

===Lyrics===
&quot;The Low End Theory&quot; is regarded for its socially conscious lyrics, which include subjects such as relationships, date rape, the hip-hop industry and consumerism. Other lyrics are devoted to word play, humor and &quot;showing off.&quot; The album introduced the lyrical interplay and chemistry between Q-Tip and Phife Dawg, the latter of whom experienced a lyrical breakout. While acknowledging that Q-Tip had &quot;already proven he is a highly skilled lyricist&quot;, Reef of &quot;The Source&quot; also stated, &quot;Those who questioned Phife&#x27;s microphone techniques on the first album will swallow those doubts as he practically steals the show on this one.&quot; The album is also noted for its minimal use of explicit lyrics, as Ron Carter only agreed to record songs on the condition that the group avoid profanity, to which Q-Tip assured they were addressing &quot;real issues.&quot;

The duo&#x27;s lyrical delivery, flow, and styles contrasted each other; Q-Tip had a mellow voice and was philosophical, reflective, contemplative and esoteric, while Phife Dawg had a high-pitched voice and was comical, battle rhyme-ready, streetwise and self-deprecating. John Bush of AllMusic said the pair&#x27;s rapping &quot;could be the smoothest of any rap record ever heard&quot;, adding that they &quot;are so in tune with each other, they sound like flip sides of the same personality, fluidly trading off on rhymes, with the former earning his nickname (the Abstract) and Phife concerning himself with the more concrete issues of being young, gifted, and black.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Low End Theory&quot; peaked at number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 13 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Upon its release, the album&#x27;s commercial potential was doubted by music critics and Jive record executives, including label CEO Barry Weiss. However, on February 19, 1992, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States. On February 1, 1995, it was certified platinum by the RIAA, with shipments of one million copies.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; received widespread critical acclaim. It was awarded a perfect five mic rating in &quot;The Source&quot;, with reviewer Reef lauding their &quot;progressive sound&quot; and &quot;streetwise edge&quot;, adding that &quot;there&#x27;s no sophomore jinx to be found here—only real hip-hop.&quot; Iestyn George of &quot;NME&quot; praised the album as a &quot;quantum leap&quot; from &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot;, noting, &quot;Gone are the quirky samples that gave them their lighter edge, replaced by stark, hard-hitting beats.&quot; George also credited Q-Tip and Phife Dawg for &quot;trading lines like psychic sparring partners&quot;, as they &quot;pause, interject, charm and challenge with understated aplomb.&quot;

James Bernard of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commended the group for its jazzy sound, which &quot;perfectly complements their laid-back, raspy delivery&quot;, but was critical of the album&#x27;s lack of danceable songs, calling it &quot;the greatest hip-hop album that will never quicken my pulse.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was reserved in his praise, believing the group delivered &quot;goofball rhymes&quot; from a &quot;well-meaning middle class&quot; perspective, later writing that &quot;like so many &#x27;beats,&#x27; &quot;Low End Theory&quot;″s Ron Carter bass was really a glorified sound effect—what excited its admirers wasn&#x27;t its thrust, or even the thrill of the sound itself, so much as the classiness it signified.&quot; He named &quot;Check the Rhime&quot; and &quot;Buggin&#x27; Out&quot; as highlights, while giving the album a three-star honorable mention, indicating &quot;an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure.&quot;

===Retrospect===
In the years since its release, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; has received further widespread acclaim from music critics and writers, many of whom regard it as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, writer Mac Randall lauded it as a &quot;hip-hop masterpiece.&quot; AllMusic writer John Bush, who declared it &quot;the most consistent and flowing hip-hop album ever recorded&quot;, stated that the record &quot;outdid all expectations and has held up as perhaps the best hip-hop LP of all time.&quot; Bush also praised the group&#x27;s use of the double bass, drums and samples: &quot;It&#x27;s a tribute to their unerring production sense that, with just those few tools, Tribe produced one of the best hip-hop albums in history, a record that sounds better with each listen. &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; is an unqualified success, the perfect marriage of intelligent, flowing raps to nuanced, groove-centered productions.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Quietus&quot;, Angus Batey summed up the album&#x27;s broad appeal:

Dave Heaton of &quot;PopMatters&quot; stated that the album is &quot;the point where their sound truly came together&quot;, also describing it as a &quot;remarkable experience, as aesthetically and emotionally rewarding as any work of music I can think of.&quot; Preezy Brown of &quot;Vibe&quot; called it a &quot;tour de force of groundbreaking rap tunes&quot; and a &quot;signature record in the group&#x27;s superior discography.&quot; For &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s All-Time 100 Albums, writer Josh Tyrangiel described the album as a &quot;grand exception&quot; to jazz rap being &quot;more wishful thinking on the part of critics than anything actual&quot;, also calling it &quot;socially conscious without being dull.&quot;

===Accolades===
Since its release, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; has been included on several &quot;best of&quot; lists compiled by music writers and journalists.
==Legacy and influence==

&quot;The Low End Theory&quot; is regarded as one of the most influential albums in hip-hop history, with Corbin Reiff of &quot;Complex&quot; declaring that it &quot;broke major ground and pushed the sonic envelope of the entire rap genre.&quot; It has been stated to have helped shape alternative hip-hop in the 1990s, as the group&#x27;s &quot;mellow innovations&quot; helped jazz rap gain significant exposure from 1992 to 1993. With the album, the group is credited for showcasing how hip-hop was made before commercial success influenced many rappers&#x27; creativity, and for challenging the &quot;macho posturing&quot; of hardcore and gangsta rap.

The album is regarded as Phife Dawg&#x27;s lyrical breakout, as he established himself as a formidable MC. A breakout verse by Leaders of the New School member Busta Rhymes, on the single &quot;Scenario&quot;, led to stardom and helped launch his successful solo career. Praised for his improvement &quot;both as an MC and a boardsman&quot;, Q-Tip&#x27;s rhyme on the single &quot;Check the Rhime&quot;: &quot;Industry rule number 4,080 / Record company people are shady&quot; is one of the most quoted lines in hip-hop, while the album has been called the &quot;&quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; of hip-hop&quot; for its groundbreaking approach to hip-hop production and engineering. The album cover is regarded as one of the greatest and most iconic in hip-hop history; on a top 50 list by &quot;Complex&quot;, it was ranked number one.

The album is credited with establishing &quot;the musical, cultural, and historical link between hip-hop and jazz&quot;, and is regarded as a &quot;successful fusion of opposites: the complex musical textures of jazz and the straightforward boom-bap of rap.&quot; Writer Joseph Patel called it &quot;a consummate link between generations&quot;, which took the essence of jazz and hip-hop, and &quot;showing they originated from the same black center.&quot; In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 154 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time; in a revised 2012 list, it was ranked at number 153, and in 2020, it moved up to number 43. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that people previously &quot;connected the dots between hip-hop and jazz&quot;, as both were revolutionary forms of black music based on improvisation and flow, however, &quot;this LP drew the entire picture.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New York Observer&quot; on the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Ron Hart stated:

&quot;The Low End Theory&quot; has influenced many hip-hop and R&amp;B musicians. Producer 9th Wonder described the album as his &quot;personal soundtrack&quot; while growing up, also stating that the group &quot;changed my life.&quot; He further commented on the influence of the group: &quot;It&#x27;s safe to say, for me, as well as Phonte, as well as Slum Village, Mos Def, Kweli, The Roots, Pharrell, you name it, Outkast, we could go on forever to say if you look at the A Tribe Called Quest family tree, they got a lot of offspring.&quot; The album has also influenced Kanye West, Common, D&#x27;Angelo, Jill Scott, Nas, Kendrick Lamar, Logic, Havoc, Madlib, Robert Glasper, and Dr. Dre, who produced his solo debut &quot;The Chronic&quot; after being inspired by the album. Musicians from other genres have also cited it as an influence, including rock musician Jack White and electronica musician James Lavelle.

<text>USS &quot;Oriskany&quot; (CV/CVA-34), ( or ), was one of the few s completed after World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was named for the Battle of Oriskany during the Revolutionary War.

The history of &quot;Oriskany&quot; differs considerably from that of her sister ships. Originally designed as a &quot;long-hulled&quot; &quot;Essex&quot;-class ship (considered by some authorities to be a separate class, the ), she was not completed and construction was suspended in 1946 after the end of World War II. She eventually was converted to an updated design called SCB-27 (&quot;27-Charlie&quot;) and commissioned in 1950. This updated version became the template for modernization of 14 other &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships. &quot;Oriskany&quot; was the final &quot;Essex&quot;-class ship completed.

She operated primarily in the Pacific into the 1970s, earning two battle stars for service in the Korean War, and ten for service in the Vietnam War. In 1966, one of the worst shipboard fires since World War II broke out on &quot;Oriskany&quot; when a magnesium flare was accidentally ignited; forty-four men died in the fire.

&quot;Oriskany&quot;″s post-service history also differs considerably from that of her sister ships. Decommissioned in 1976, she was sold for scrap in 1995, but was repossessed in 1997 because nothing was being done. In 2004, the Navy decided to sink her to create an artificial reef off the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico. After much environmental review and remediation to remove toxic substances, the ship was carefully sunk in May 2006. She settled in an upright position at a depth accessible to recreational divers. As of February 2025, &quot;Oriskany&quot; is the largest vessel ever sunk to make a reef. However, the SS United States is planned to be sunk off the coast of Destin, Florida by 2026, becoming the worlds largest artificial reef.

==Construction and commissioning==

The name &quot;Oriskany&quot; was originally assigned to , but that hull was renamed &quot;Wasp&quot; when the keel was laid in 1942. &quot;CV-34&quot; was laid down on 1 May 1944 by the New York Naval Shipyard (NYNSY), launched on 13 October 1945, and sponsored by Mrs. Clarence Cannon. Construction was suspended on 22 August 1946, when the ship was approximately 85% complete.

Beginning on 8 August 1947, &quot;Oriskany&quot; was redesigned as the prototype for the SCB-27 modernization program and torn down to 60% complete. To handle the new generation of carrier aircraft, the flight deck structure was massively reinforced. Stronger elevators, more powerful hydraulic catapults, and new arresting gear were installed. The island structure was rebuilt, the anti-aircraft turrets were removed, and blisters were added to the hull. Blistering the hull (also known as adding bulges) increases the cross-sectional area of a ship&#x27;s hull, thereby increasing its buoyancy and stability. It also provides increased bunker volume. In the case of &quot;Oriskany&quot;, this would have been for aviation fuel. These features would have been crucial to a ship that had so much topside weight added after its original design. &quot;Oriskany&quot; was commissioned in the New York Naval Shipyard on 25 September 1950.

==Service history==

===1950–1956===

&quot;Oriskany&quot; departed New York on 6 December 1950, for carrier qualification operations off Jacksonville, Florida, followed by a Christmas call at Newport, Rhode Island. She resumed operations off Jacksonville through 11 January 1951, when she embarked Carrier Air Group 1 for shakedown out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

After major modifications at New York Naval Shipyard from 6 March to 2 April, she embarked Carrier Air Group 4 for training off Jacksonville, then departed Newport on 15 May 1951, for Mediterranean deployment with the 6th Fleet.

Having swept from ports of Italy and France to those of Greece and Turkey, from there to the shores of Tripoli, &quot;Oriskany&quot; returned to Quonset Point, Rhode Island, on 4 October 1951. She entered Gravesend Bay, New York, on 6 November 1951 to offload ammunition and to have her masts removed to allow passage under the East River Bridges to the New York Naval Shipyard. Overhaul included the installation of a new flight deck, steering system, and bridge. Work was complete by 15 May 1952, and the carrier steamed the next day to take on ammunition at Norfolk, Virginia, from 19 to 22 May. She then got underway to join the Pacific Fleet, steaming via Guantanamo Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Horn, Valparaíso, and Lima, arriving San Diego, California, on 21 July.

Following carrier qualifications for Carrier Air Group 19, &quot;Oriskany&quot; departed San Diego on 15 September 1952, to aid United Nations forces in Korea. She arrived at Yokosuka on 17 October and joined Task Force 77 off the Korean Coast on 31 October. Her aircraft struck hard with bombing and strafing attacks against enemy supply lines and coordinated bombing missions with surface gunstrikes along the coast. Her pilots downed two Soviet-built MiG-15 jets and damaged a third on 18 November.

Strikes continued through 11 February, attacking enemy artillery positions, troop emplacements, and supply dumps along the main battlefront. Following a brief upkeep period in Japan, &quot;Oriskany&quot; returned to combat on 1 March 1953. On 6 March, three men were killed and 13 were injured when a general-purpose bomb from a F4U Corsair broke loose and detonated. She continued in action until 29 March, called at Hong Kong, then resumed air strikes on 8 April. She departed the Korean Coast on 22 April, touched at Yokosuka, and then departed for San Diego on 2 May, arriving there on 18 May.

Following readiness training along the California coast, &quot;Oriskany&quot; departed San Francisco on 14 September 1953 to aid the 7th Fleet watching over the uneasy truce in Korea, arriving in Yokosuka on 15 October. Thereafter, she cruised the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, and the area of the Philippines. After providing air support for Marine amphibious assault exercises at Iwo Jima, the carrier returned to San Diego on 22 April 1954. She entered San Francisco Naval Shipyard for overhaul; the overhaul was completed on 22 October, when she put to sea for the first of a series of coastal operations, and participation in the production of the Korean War-era film &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot;, where she stood in for the escort carrier USS &quot;Savo Island&quot;.

&quot;Oriskany&quot; arrived at Yokosuka on 2 April 1955, and operated with the Fast Carrier Task Force ranging from Japan and Okinawa to the Philippines. This deployment ended on 7 September, and the carrier arrived at NAS Alameda, California, on 21 September.

She cruised the California Coast while qualifying pilots of Air Group 9, then put to sea from Alameda on 11 February 1956 for another rigorous Western Pacific (WestPac) deployment.

===1957–1968===
&quot;Oriskany&quot; returned to San Francisco on 13 August 1956, and entered the shipyard to undergo the SCB-125A modernization program on 1 October. She was decommissioned there on 2 January 1957. &quot;Oriskany&quot; received a new angled flight deck, aft deck edge elevator, enlarged forward elevator, and enclosed hurricane bow. Powerful new steam catapults replaced the older hydraulic catapults. The wooden flight deck planking was also replaced with aluminum planking.

&quot;Oriskany&quot; was recommissioned at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 7 March 1959. Four days later she departed for shakedown out of San Diego with Carrier Air Group 14 embarked. Operations along the West Coast continued until 14 May 1960, when she again deployed to WestPac, returning to San Diego on 15 December. She entered San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 30 March 1961, for a five-month overhaul that included the first aircraft carrier installation of the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS).

&quot;Oriskany&quot; departed the shipyard on 9 September for underway training out of San Diego until 7 June 1962, when she again deployed to the Far East with Carrier Air Group 16 embarked. She returned to San Diego on 17 December for operational readiness training off the West Coast.

The carrier was again stationed out of San Diego on 1 August 1963, for Far Eastern waters, with Carrier Air Wing 16 embarked. She arrived at Subic Bay on 31 August 1963, and from there steamed to Japan. She was at the port of Iwakuni, Japan, on the morning of 31 October, &quot;en route&quot; to the coast of South Vietnam. There, she stood by for any eventuality as word was received of the coup d&#x27;état taking place in Saigon. When the crisis abated, the carrier resumed operations from Japanese ports.

&quot;Oriskany&quot; returned to San Diego on 10 March 1964. After overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, she steamed for refresher training out of San Diego, followed by qualifications for Carrier Air Wing 16. During this period her flight deck was used to test the E-2 Hawkeye, the Navy&#x27;s new airborne early warning aircraft. She also provided orientation to senior officers of eight allied nations.

&quot;Oriskany&quot; departed San Diego on 5 April 1965, for WestPac, arriving at Subic Bay on 27 April. By this time more United States Marines had landed in the South Vietnam to support Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troops against increased communist pressure. &quot;Oriskany&quot; added her weight to the massive American naval strength supporting South Vietnam. In combat operations that brought her and embarked Carrier Air Wing 16 the Navy Unit Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service from 10 May to 6 December 1965, she carried out over 12,000 combat sorties and delivered nearly 10,000 tons (9,100 tonnes) of ordnance against enemy forces. She departed Subic Bay on 30 November, and returned to San Diego on 16 December.

&quot;Oriskany&quot; again left San Diego for the Far East on 26 May 1966, arriving in Yokosuka, Japan, on 14 June. She steamed for &quot;Dixie Station&quot; off South Vietnam on 27 June. The carrier shifted to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Gulf of Tonkin on 8 July. In the following months there were brief respites for replenishment in Subic Bay, then back into the action that saw her launch 7,794 combat sorties.

====1966 fire====

The carrier was on station the morning of 26 October 1966, when a fire erupted on the starboard side of the ship&#x27;s forward hangar bay and raced through five decks, killing 44 men. Many who lost their lives were veteran combat pilots who had flown raids over Vietnam a few hours earlier. The cause of the fire was a magnesium parachute flare that caused an explosion in the forward flare locker of Hangar Bay 1, beneath the carrier&#x27;s flight deck. Subsequent investigation showed the flare functioned as designed and the explosion was caused by human error. A seaman accidentally ignited the flare, and in a panic, threw it into the weapons locker where the flares were kept for storage, instead of throwing it over the side into the water; this ignited all the flares in the locker and caused horrific damage. Some of her crewmen jettisoned heavy bombs which lay within reach of the flames, while others wheeled planes out of danger, rescued pilots, and helped quell the blaze throughout the next three hours. Medical assistance was rushed to the carrier from carriers and .

Later investigation by Captain John H Iarrobino of &quot;Oriskany&quot; and analysis by the Naval Ammunition Depot in Crane, Indiana, showed that one in every thousand flares could ignite accidentally if jarred. Five crew members were court-martialed as a result of the incident but were acquitted. After this incident and others, the flare design used by the Navy was changed to a safer design immune to accidental ignition, and crews were increased to stabilize numbers so all activities could be properly supervised.

&quot;Oriskany&quot; steamed to Subic Bay on 28 October, where victims of the fire were transferred to waiting aircraft for transportation to the United States. A week later the carrier departed for San Diego, arriving on 16 November. San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard completed repairs on 23 March 1967, and &quot;Oriskany&quot;, with Carrier Air Wing 16 embarked, underwent training.

====Return to service====
She then was stationed out of San Francisco Bay on 16 June to take station in waters off Vietnam. Designated flagship of Carrier Division 9 in Subic Bay on 9 July, she commenced &quot;Yankee Station&quot; operations on 14 July. On 26 July she provided medical assistance to the fire-ravaged attack carrier .

On 26 October 1967, then–Lieutenant Commander John McCain flew off &quot;Oriskany&quot; in an A-4 Skyhawk on his 23rd bombing mission of the Vietnam War. He was shot down that day and was a prisoner of war until January 1973.

The carrier turned for home on 15 January 1968, having completed 122 days of combat operations over North Vietnam. During the combat tour, Carrier Air Wing 16 suffered perhaps the highest loss rate of any naval air wing during the Vietnam War, losing half of assigned planes – 29 to combat damage and another 10 to operational causes – and had 20 pilots killed and another 9 taken prisoner. One contribution to this heavy loss rate was the air wings’ unrelenting pace, as the pilots flew over 9,500 missions, including 181 air strikes into the heavily defended Hanoi–Haiphong corridor. Another contribution was the existence of safe havens for trucks and munitions within Haiphong in particular, as that meant targeting the flow of supplies in more heavily protected chokepoints further south. &quot;Oriskany&quot; returned to Naval Air Station Alameda on 31 January 1968, and entered San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard on 7 February for an eight-month overhaul to have new electrical generators, air conditioning and water distillers installed. The carrier also received repairs to her flight elevators and had her boilers refurbished, in addition to the usual hundreds of post-deployment routine maintenance fixes. With yard work complete in the fall, the crew conducted refresher and pre-deployment training over the winter.

In early 1969, &quot;Oriskany&quot; embarked a new air wing for familiarization and qualifications in preparation for her fourth deployment to Vietnam. In contrast to her previous air wing, Carrier Air Wing 19 (CVW-19) did not include any A-1 Skyraiders, having two squadrons of F-8J Crusaders in VF-191 and VF-194, and three squadrons of A-4 Skyhawks in VA-23, VA-192 and VA-195, as well as the usual detachments of reconnaissance, tanker, and early warning aircraft. Upon completion of work, the carrier underwent refresher training and flight qualifications before deploying to the Far East in April 1969.

From 16 April 1969, Carrier Air Wing 19 made six deployments aboard &quot;Oriskany&quot; (the first four to support the Vietnam War in the Gulf of Tonkin until the end of the war in 1973).

===1969–1976===

The &quot;Oriskany&quot; arrived at Yankee Station in May 1969; and began combat operations in a much more restricted environment than the previous deployment. Previously, in April 1968, President Johnson had restricted armed attacks south of the nineteenth parallel, which limited strikes to the southern third of North Vietnam. Following a massive six-month interdiction effort that shut down all North Vietnamese rail traffic out of Haiphong, closed two inland waterways and eliminated virtual all coastal shipments, the air campaign was suspended on 1 November 1968. Domestic political considerations, mainly the upcoming presidential elections, played the critical role in this decision as President Johnson was leaving office. With operations focusing further south, the only pilot loss of the cruise took place on 20 July 1969 when Lt. Stanley K. Smiley&#x27;s Skyhawk crashed and exploded after being hit by small arms fire. The second line period ended on 30 June and, after ten days at Subic, the warship&#x27;s third line period took place between 13 and 30 July. After a fourth line period between 16 August and 12 September, &quot;Oriskany&quot; steamed north to Korea to fly intermittent reconnaissance escort missions into early October. During that time, on 20 September 1969, Captain John A. Gillcrist took over as the commanding officer. Following a fifth line period off Vietnam between 8 and 31 October, the aircraft carrier turned for home, arriving at Alameda via Subic Bay on 17 November.

Following a dry dock period at San Francisco Naval Shipyard over the winter, where the aircraft carrier was modified to support A-7 Corsair II aircraft, Oriskany embarked CVW-19 that spring for refresher operations. In contrast to previous deployments, she carried only four combat squadrons – VF-191 and VF-194 equipped with the familiar F8 Crusaders and VA-153 and VA-155 equipped with A-7. Commencing her fifth Vietnam deployment on 14 May 1970, &quot;Oriskany&quot; inchopped on 1 June and began combat operations at Yankee Station on 14 June. Like her last deployment, Oriskany launched strikes against North Vietnamese logistics targets in eastern Laos, initially targeting storage areas, bunkers and lines of communication in conjunction with strikes by the Seventh Air Force. Equipped with better electronics gear, the A-7 proved especially useful during night raids on the Ho Chi Minh trail. The missions remained dangerous, however, with an A-7 from VA-155 lost in a failed catapult shot on 25 June and a VA-153 A-7 crashing in Laos on 28 June. In the latter case, the aircraft – flown by Cdr. Donald D. Aldern, in command of Air Wing Nineteen – exploded during a night attack run, presumably after taking flak damage. &quot;Oriskany&quot; conducted three line periods – 14–29 June, 13–21 July, 3–25 August and 18 September to 13 October – and launched over 5,300 sorties. During the latter line period, Captain Frank S. Haak relieved Captain Gillcrist on 11 September 1970, and became the new commanding officer.

About a month later, during heavy seas, a VF-191 F-8 returning from a night combat air patrol on 6 October crashed the flight deck and exploded, killing Lt. John B. Martin. In November, as part of the Navy&#x27;s efforts to reduce costs, the number of aircraft carriers off Vietnam was reduced to one, meaning that &quot;Oriskany&quot;″s sole focus in her fourth line period 7–22 November was missions over Laos. In that effort, she joined the Seventh Air Force in strikes against four identified bottleneck points along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The carrier suffered another deadly accident on 14 November, when an RF-8G from VFP-63 skidded off the flight deck after a material failure caused a failed catapult launch, ultimately causing the death of Lt. Joseph R. Klugg. Then, in an unusual assignment, &quot;Oriskany&quot; flew 14 diversionary sorties over North Vietnam early on 21 November in support of the Son Tay POW rescue mission and another 48 missions during retaliatory strikes later that day. The aircraft carrier turned for home the next day, arriving in Alameda on 10 December 1970.

&quot;Oriskany&quot; underwent a restricted availability at Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco during January 1971, receiving a much looked-for upgrade in the SPN-41 all-weather carrier landing system. Refresher training passed uneventfully in March, and on 14 May the aircraft carrier departed Alameda for her sixth Vietnam deployment. During this 1971 deployment, the main mission remained to strike operations in Laos; and while there were no combat losses, CVW-19 did lose four aircraft to operational accidents. Two cases were fatal, with Cdr. Charles D. Metzler killed when his F-8 inverted and splashed while in a landing holding pattern on 21 June and Cdr. Thomas P. Frank drowned after ejecting from his stricken A-7 following a catapult launch failure on 1 November. A week later, &quot;Oriskany&quot; aircraft took part in Operation Proud Deep, the successful 7–8 November strike (the largest in three years) against three North Vietnamese airfields whose fighters were beginning to worry Air Force planners. Following these last missions, &quot;Oriskany&quot; sailed south to Singapore for eight days of upkeep. &quot;Oriskany&quot; departed Singapore on 3 December 1971, and crossed the Pacific to arrive at Alameda via Subic Bay on 18 December. As per her custom, &quot;Oriskany&quot; entered Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, San Francisco, on 17 January 1972 for her winter restricted availability. Refresher training followed in April 1972 and she embarked CVW-19 for qualifications in May. Events in Vietnam meanwhile, forced the warship into feverish preparations for deployment; and she sailed for her seventh Vietnam tour on 5 June. Following refueling stops at Pearl Harbor and Guam, the aircraft carrier arrived at Subic Bay on 21 June. The 1972 deployment was met with various problems, including a collision with ammunition ship during an underway replenishment, the death of Lt. Leon F. Haas, and loss of two propellers and one shaft, which required the ship much of August and November in Yokosuka, Japan, to make repairs.

With peace talks in Paris stalled, &quot;Oriskany&quot;″s aircraft returned to Yankee Station and continued to strike communist targets in South Vietnam. Later, she joined the Operation Linebacker II &quot;Christmas bombing&quot; campaign, for her sixth line period, 27 December – 30 January 1973. Attacks were then restricted to enemy targets south of the 20th parallel for the first two weeks of January and then below the 17th parallel starting on the 16th. With the Paris Peace Accords signed on 27 January 1973, &quot;Oriskany&quot;″s aviators finished up their last strikes over South Vietnam that same day. After a short rest period at Cubi Point in early February the aircraft carrier conducted one final combat line period, 11–22 February, when CVW-19 bombed enemy targets in Laos in a last effort to assist indigenous allies there against Communist infiltration. Following upkeep at Cubi Point 8–14 March, &quot;Oriskany&quot; sailed for home, arriving at Alameda on 30 March after completing 169 days on the line, her longest – and what proved to be her last combat tour; all-in-all receiving ten battle stars for its Vietnamese service.

After her usual fast-paced refit and training cycle, &quot;Oriskany&quot; got underway for the Far East on 18 October 1973. After arrival at Subic Bay on 5 November, the aircraft carrier began preparations for operations in the Indian Ocean, a change of pace from her last seven tours off Vietnam. The aircraft carrier sailed south, transited the Straits of Malacca and rendezvoused with in the Indian Ocean. The two carriers conducted training operations there, and &quot;Oriskany&quot; visited Mombasa, Kenya, 22–27 December, before returning to the South China Sea in January 1974. The carrier then conducted various type training exercises out of Subic Bay in February and March, primarily concentrating on day and night flight operations in conjunction with other 7th Fleet units. Following a series of three Fleet exercises in April, the warship visited Manila in May before sailing for home, arriving at Alameda on 5 June 1974.

Two months later, the ship entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 15 August for an extended availability that lasted until 9 April 1975. Following refresher operations with CVW-19, &quot;Oriskany&quot; sailed on her fifteenth WESTPAC deployment on 16 September 1975. The carrier conducted war at sea and other exercises out of Subic Bay before returning home on 3 March 1976. Owing to defense budget cuts, together with the ship&#x27;s increasingly poor material condition, &quot;Oriskany&quot; was listed for inactivation on 15 April 1976.

===1976–2004===
Following 25 years of service, &quot;Oriskany&quot; was decommissioned on 30 September 1976, and laid up for long-term storage in Bremerton, Washington, to be maintained as a mobilization asset. Reagan Administration proposals to reactivate &quot;Oriskany&quot; were rejected by the United States Congress on the basis of her poor material condition and limited air wing capability. The cost of reactivation was estimated at $520 million for FY 1982 ($ in ). At the end of the Cold War and the subsequent reduction of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s active force, &quot;Oriskany&quot; was recognized as being obsolete and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in 1989. Her hull was stripped of all equipment that could be reused or recycled. The ship&#x27;s bell (removed during decommissioning in 1976) is now on display in Oriskany, New York, and various parts were scavenged to support the USS Hornet Museum in Alameda, California, and other Navy ship museums.

&quot;Oriskany&quot; received two battle stars for Korean War service and ten for Vietnam War service.

In the early 1990s, a group of businessmen from Japan wanted to buy &quot;Oriskany&quot; and display her in Tokyo Bay as part of a planned &quot;City of America&quot; exhibit. Congressional legislation was initiated to transfer &quot;Oriskany&quot;, but the project failed due to lack of financing.

&quot;Oriskany&quot; was sold for scrap by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service on 9 September 1995 to Pegasus International, a start-up company at the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. The contractor towed the ship from Bremerton to Vallejo, but the contract was terminated on 30 July 1997 because of lack of progress. While berthed at Mare Island in rusted and decrepit condition, she was used as a setting for the Robin Williams film, &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (1998) as part of the representation of Hell.

The Navy took back possession of the ship and after a few more years at the former Mare Island Navy Yard. In 1999 she was towed 15,000 miles via the Strait of Magellan by &quot;Sea Victory&quot; to the Maritime Administration&#x27;s Beaumont Reserve Fleet in Beaumont, Texas, for storage pending availability of funding for her disposal.

===2004 – artificial reef===
The Navy announced on 5 April 2004 that it would transfer the former aircraft carrier to the State of Florida for use as an artificial reef. In September 2003 the Navy awarded a contract to Resolve Marine Group/ESCO Marine Joint Venture for the environmental remediation work necessary for sinking the ship as an artificial reef. The contractor towed the ship to Corpus Christi, Texas, in January 2004 and completed the environmental preparation work in December 2004.

&quot;Oriskany&quot; was the first United States warship slated to become an artificial reef, under authority granted by the fiscal 2004 National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 108–136). &quot;Oriskany&quot; was towed to Pensacola in December 2004 and was originally scheduled to be sunk with controlled charges south of Pensacola by June 2005. Exhaustive ecological and human health studies were conducted by Navy scientists in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to demonstrate no adverse impact from reefing the ship. Failure to gain EPA approval caused a delay, so &quot;Oriskany&quot; was then towed back to Texas in June to ride out the 2005 hurricane season. Completion and peer review of a complex Prospective Risk Assessment Model developed in consultation with EPA, the first for any ship reefing project, was necessary to support EPA&#x27;s February 2006 decision to issue a risk-based PCB disposal approval for the estimated 750 lb (340 kg) of polychlorinated biphenyls contained in solid form, mostly integral in the insulation layers of the electrical cabling throughout the ship.

Based on the EPA&#x27;s approval, after a public comment period, the ship was towed to Pensacola in March 2006 for final preparations for sinking. A team of Navy personnel accomplished the sinking of the ship on 17 May 2006, supported by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Escambia County Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Pensacola Police Department, and several sheriff departments of Escambia County and surrounding counties. A Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal team from Panama City, FL detonated C-4 explosive charges of approximately 500 lb (230 kg), strategically placed on 22 sea connection pipes in various machinery spaces. The ship sank stern first 37 minutes after detonation in of water in the Gulf of Mexico.

As was intended, the ship came to rest lying upright. The flight deck was at a depth of , and its island rose to . Following Hurricane Gustav in 2008, the ship shifted 10 feet deeper leaving the flight deck at . The island structure is accessible to recreational divers, but the flight deck requires additional training and equipment. It is now popularly known as the &quot;Great Carrier Reef&quot;, a reference to Australia&#x27;s Great Barrier Reef.

&quot;The Times&quot; of London named the &quot;Oriskany&quot; wreck as one of the top ten wreck diving sites in the world. &quot;The New York Times&quot; Web video &quot;Diving the U.S.S. Oriskany&quot; explored the &quot;Oriskany&quot; wreck two years after its sinking.

<doc id="195631" wikidata="Q3508795" url="?curid=195631" title="Langer–Giedion syndrome">
<text>Langer–Giedion syndrome (LGS) is a very uncommon autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by a deletion of a small section of material on chromosome 8. It is named after the two doctors who undertook the main research into the condition in the 1960s. Diagnosis is usually made at birth or in early childhood.

==Signs and symptoms==
The features associated with this condition include: mild to moderate learning difficulties, short stature, unique facial features, small head and skeletal abnormalities including bony growths projecting from the surfaces of bones.

===Craniofacial===
Individuals with Langer–Giedion syndrome may display characteristic craniofacial abnormalities. These include a long prominent philtrum, a thin upper lip, wide spaced eyes, a bulbous nasal tip, a broad nasal bridge, wide nostrils, micrognathia, retrognathia, deep set eyes and large ears. The head itself is often unusually small in comparison to that of unaffected individuals of the same age and sex. Dental abnormalities, such as supernumerary central incisors and the absence of some teeth, may occur.

===Muscoskeletal===

Langer–Giedion syndrome causes cone shaped epiphyses of the phalanges of the hands and short fingers and toes. The fifth fingers are sometimes bent. Skeletal abnormalities not affecting the hands and feet may also occur. These include winged scapula, thin ribs and scoliosis. In addition, individuals with Langer–Giedion syndrome may develop hip problems similar to those seen in Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease such as progressive degeneration of the head of the thigh bone.

As affected individuals age they often develop benign boney growths called exostoses which project off the surfaces of the bones. Depending on the location of the exostoses they cause numerous complications such as compression of the spinal cord, asymmetric growth of the limbs and reduced mobility.

Langer–Giedion syndrome initially causes joint hypermobility. This progresses to joint stiffness later in life when osteochondromas begin to develop, typically between infancy and mid-childhood, which decreases mobility. Hip dysplasia may be present, usually developing in early adulthood, although it can occur in infancy or childhood.

===Skin, hair, sweat glands and nails===

Ectodermal dysplasia is a key feature of Langer–Giedion syndrome.

The majority of individuals with Langer–Giedion syndrome have sparse scalp hair; this is particularly severe in males, who often experience alopecia shortly after puberty. Despite this the eyebrows may be unusually thick.

==Cause==
The syndrome occurs when a small piece of chromosome 8&#x27;s long arm, which contains a number of genes, is missing. The loss of these genes is responsible for some of the overall characteristics of Langer–Giedion syndrome.

The missing portion of the chromosome is 8q23.2–q24.1. This region includes the genes &quot;TRPS1&quot; and &quot;EXT1&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and can be confirmed by cytogenetic testing, when the deletion is in an average of 5 Mb (millions of base pairs). Nowadays, it is a common practice to run an aCGH (array chromosome hybridization genome) study on peripheral blood of the patient, in order to delineate the extent of the loss of the genomic area, and the deleted genes.

==Treatment==
While no genetic syndrome is capable of being cured, treatments are available for some symptoms. External fixators have been used for limbic and facial reconstructions.

<doc id="195632" wikidata="Q990293" url="?curid=195632" title="Carolina, Puerto Rico">
<text>Carolina (; ) is a city and municipality on the northeastern coastal plain of Puerto Rico, immediately east of San Juan and Trujillo Alto, north of Gurabo and Juncos, and west of Canóvanas and Loíza. Part of the San Juan metropolitan area, Carolina is spread over 12 barrios and the downtown area and administrative center of Carolina Pueblo. In the coastal region of the municipality lies the resort and residential district of Isla Verde, where the main international airport of Puerto Rico, the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, is located. Carolina is the third most populated municipality in the archipelago and island.

==History==
The town was founded by Spanish colonists in 1816 as Trujillo Bajo (&quot;lower Trujillo&quot;), along with its counterpart Trujillo Alto after Trujillo, Spain. In 1857 it was renamed to San Fernando de la Carolina, later shortened to &quot;Carolina&quot;, after Charles II of Spain.

The city is known as &quot;Tierra de Gigantes&quot; (Land of Giants), not only for well-known Carolina resident Don Felipe Birriel González (who was 7&#x27;11&quot;), but also in honor of other people from Carolina, including poet Julia de Burgos and most notably the first Latin American player named to baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame, Roberto Clemente. Carolina was also home to Jesús T. Piñero, the first Puerto Rican to be appointed as governor by the United States government.
The city is also known as &quot;El Pueblo de los Tumba Brazos&quot; (The Arm Hackers&#x27; Town). During the late 1800s, the town&#x27;s major export was sugarcane.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Carolina was 11,965.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 caused flooding in Carolina. The Río Grande de Loíza floods left around 500 homes uninhabitable. The Roberto Clemente stadium lost its roof and many other structures, bridges and roads were damaged to a toll of $87 million. Given the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport is in Carolina, the destruction in Carolina created a challenge and the airport remained closed for three days. Two weeks after, the airport was attempting to operate a more regular schedule, but electricity was inconsistent and on October 10, nearly a month after the hurricane the airport was running on generators again.

==Geography==
Carolina municipality has a number of rivers such as the Río Canovanillas, Río Grande de Loíza, La Torrecilla, Piñones Lagoons.

<text>USS &quot;United States&quot; (CVA-58) was to be the lead ship of a new design of aircraft carrier. On 29 July 1948, President Harry Truman approved construction of five &quot;supercarriers&quot;, for which funds had been provided in the Naval Appropriations Act of 1949. The keel of the first of the five planned postwar carriers was laid down on 18 April 1949 at Newport News Drydock and Shipbuilding. The program was canceled in 1949, &quot;United States&quot; was not completed, and the other four planned carriers were never built.

== Design ==
The chief proponent for the new large carrier was Admiral Marc Mitscher. He wanted a carrier that would be able to handle the most effective weapons of the day. Early design discussions centered around developing a carrier that would be able to support combat missions using the new jet aircraft. These were faster, larger and significantly heavier than the aircraft which the - and -class carriers were handling at the end of the Second World War. It was thought that the aircraft carried would have to have longer range to allow the carrier to operate farther away from the target. The deck would have to be able to handle the weight of the heavy jet aircraft landing on the deck. The implication was that the ship&#x27;s strength deck would have to be the flight deck rather than the hangar deck, as had been the case for earlier U.S. carriers. Armoring the flight deck would mean the ship would have a greater tendency to roll in rough seas, as a greater part of the ship&#x27;s weight would be high above the waterline. 

Based on the size of the aircraft that the new ship was to carry, the design of the carrier was to be flush decked, meaning that the ship would have no island control structure. This would be done to create more space for large winged aircraft. The flush-deck design carried with it two major concerns. The first concern was over how smoke from the power plants would be diverted from the flight deck. This had been a major issue with the US Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carrier, , in the 1920s when carrier development was first underway. The second concern was the placement of early warning radar equipment to allow the ship to detect incoming attacks. One solution was for a command ship to be close by which would carry the commander of the task force and the early detection radar. The command ship would radio electronic information and orders from its command center over to the carrier. This command ship role was termed a &#x27;pilotfish&#x27; and the would be built in part to fulfill this role. A second solution was for the ship to carry aircraft that could fly the early warning radar. These would fly overhead and detect approaching aircraft. In truth, the ship as designed would not be able to safely operate by itself, but would need to operate in conjunction with traditional fleet carriers as a complementary bomber-carrier. In fact, the ship was being designed on the basis of the aircraft that it was thought it would carry, and these were based on projections of what aircraft would be in existence in the period 1952 to 1960.

Discussions included debate on the aircraft carrier&#x27;s mission. One view was that it would carry a group of large bombers that would be secured to the flight deck, with no hangar for these aircraft, as they would be too large to move up and down in an elevator. Though they would be built to carry large nuclear weapons, the total amount of space used for munition storage would be reduced as multiple strikes would not be likely. A small hangar deck would be available for a limited fighter escort and a small magazine for a small number of heavy nuclear weapons. Another plan was that it could be built with conventional attack capability with a large hangar deck for a large air wing and a large magazine. The nuclear attack supporters won in the initial design stage, but the design was modified to carry more fighters. The flush-deck &quot;United States&quot; was designed to launch and recover the 100,000 pound (45 t) aircraft required to carry early-model nuclear weapons, which weighed as much as five tons. The ship would have no permanently raised island or command tower structure. It would be equipped with four aircraft elevators located at the deck edges to avoid decreasing the structural strength of the flight deck. Four catapults would be used to launch aircraft, with two at the bow and two others on the outer edge of the deck staggered back. The carrier was designed so that it could land aircraft at the rear while at the same time launching aircraft from the catapults at the bow and forward area simultaneously. The construction cost of the new ship was estimated at US$189 million (equivalent to US$ billion in ).

== Proposed operations ==
USS &quot;United States&quot; was designed with the primary mission of carrying long-range bomber aircraft that could carry a heavy enough load to undertake nuclear bombardment missions. It would also carry long range escort fighters that would fly along and protect its bombers. The ship could also take on other roles, such as providing air support for amphibious forces and to conduct sea control operations, but it was primarily to be a &quot;bomber carrier&quot;. It was thought it would operate in a task force coupled with traditional attack carriers, which would provide the air cover for the task force. That mission was virtually certain to make the ship a target of inter-service rivalries over missions and funding. The United States Air Force viewed &quot;United States&quot; as a challenge to their monopoly on strategic nuclear weapons delivery.

== Keel laying; cancellation ==

Looking to cut the military budget and accepting without question the Air Force argument on nuclear deterrence by means of large, long-range bombers, Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson announced the cancellation of &quot;United States&quot; on 23 April 1949, five days after the ship&#x27;s keel was laid. Secretary of the Navy John Sullivan immediately resigned, and Congress held an inquiry into the manner and wisdom of Johnson&#x27;s decision. In the subsequent &quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot;, the Navy was unable to advance its case that large carriers would be essential to national defense. 

Soon afterward, Johnson and Francis P. Matthews, the man he advanced to be the new Secretary of the Navy, set about punishing those officers that let their opposition be known. Navy Admiral Louis Denfeld was forced to resign as Chief of Naval Operations, and a number of other admirals and lesser ranks were punished. The invasion of South Korea six months later resulted in an immediate need for a strong naval presence, and Matthews&#x27; position as Secretary of the Navy and Johnson&#x27;s position as Secretary of Defense crumbled, both ultimately resigning.

Soon after she was canceled, the aircraft carrier&#x27;s keel was dismantled. This freed up the drydock, allowing crews to immediately begin construction on the ocean liner SS &quot;United States&quot; (name coincidental).

The Navy soon found a means to carry nuclear weapons at sea, placed aboard the aircraft carrier in 1950. Thus the question of which service would have primary responsibility for strategic nuclear strikes was not answered with Johnson&#x27;s cancellation of USS &quot;United States&quot;.

<doc id="195640" wikidata="Q1403940" url="?curid=195640" title="No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)">
<text>No Strings Attached is the third studio album by American boy band NSYNC. It was released by Jive Records on March 21, 2000. Looking to distinguish their music from that of their labelmates, NSYNC chose to incorporate pop and R&amp;B styles. Prior to the release of the album, the band separated from their management Trans Continental and their label RCA Records; its title is a play on the idea of independence from corporate control. Contributions to the album&#x27;s production came from a wide range of producers, including NSYNC members Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez, and collaborators including Kristian Lundin, Jake Schulze, Rami, Teddy Riley, Kevin &quot;She&#x27;kspere&quot; Briggs, Richard Marx, Veit Renn, Babyface, and Guy Roche.

After several delays due to legal battles, &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics, many of whom praised the production. The album debuted atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with first-week sales of 2.4 million copies, setting the record for one-week sales in the country; a record that remained for 15 years until Adele surpassed the first-week sales record with her third studio album &quot;25&quot; (2015). Four singles were released from the album. Its lead single &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot; is credited with creating the hype for the album&#x27;s eventual landmark success. &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; was the best selling album of 2000. NSYNC promoted the album through the No Strings Attached Tour in 2000, which was the second highest-grossing tour in North America of that year.

It was considered to be the peak of the teen pop genre, as CDs were beginning to be phased out in favor of peer-to-peer file sharing sites such as Napster and LimeWire, as well as trends shifting away from the genre, beginning with the Backstreet Boys&#x27; album &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot; (2000). NSYNC were considered to be influential in crossing over music genres, which helped distinguish themselves from the Backstreet Boys, and inspire other boy bands to experiment with different genres of music while expressing their originality.

==Background==
The title of the album alludes to puppets and the idea of independence NSYNC earned following a legal battle between its then-management. NSYNC was signed by Trans Continental Management to Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) in Germany, due to a pre-existing deal, and its distribution rights in the United States were automatically bought by RCA. In 1999, NSYNC sued Trans Continental and financier, Louis J. Pearlman, due to illicit corporate practices. They cited Pearlman&#x27;s defrauding the group, which, according to MTV, was more than fifty percent of their earnings, rather than his promise of only receiving one-sixth of the profits. The band, whose self-titled debut album and follow up had commercial success, insisted &quot;they have not seen enough of the profits&quot; that they had generated by selling eight million albums in the United States alone. On October 12, 1999, Trans Continental, along with RCA&#x27;s parent, BMG Entertainment, filed a $195 million suit in a federal court to bar NSYNC&#x27;s transference to Jive and from performing or recording under their current name, as well as forcing them to return their master recordings from 1999 in preparation of their second album.

With an undisclosed settlement in 2000, NSYNC severed their recording contract with Trans Continental and switched labels from RCA Records to Jive Records, which included artists such as the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears. Jive immediately requested that the album was to be sold to retailers in March, which caused Pearlman and BMG to file a $150 million breach-of-contract suit and an injunction to stop them. NSYNC filed a countersuit in response, with member JC Chasez calling Pearlman &quot;an unscrupulous, greedy and sophisticated businessman who posed as an unselfish, loving father figure and took advantage of our trust&quot;. The judge, Anne C. Conway rejected Pearlman and BMG&#x27;s injunction, stating that &quot;the defendants have raised serious questions [...] about Mr. Pearlman and his dealings&quot;.

The album&#x27;s title was thought of by member Chris Kirkpatrick during a car ride in London after the settlement, where they were inspired by the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Got No Strings&quot; from the 1940 film, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. The titling of the album is similar to the Backstreet Boys&#x27; who also had legal wrangling with Pearlman which concluded to a settlement in October 1998 that was not disclosed; the Backstreet Boys &quot;took a shot&quot; at Pearlman by titling their 2000 studio album, &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot;. Meanwhile, the title &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; was announced in September 1999, during when the legal battle was still ongoing. Kirkpatrick revealed that the title and the album&#x27;s cover art have a personal meaning to them. According to him, the album was designed to show that they felt they were puppets stranded in strings, which alludes to their destiny being controlled. In an interview, he further explained the relationship of the strings to the album, stating that &quot;the only reasons that the strings are still attached on the album is so people can get the whole feel of the vibe of [...] &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;&quot;.

==Recording and production==

While the legal suit was underway, NSYNC continued to record songs for the album. The majority of the songs recorded were without the support of a record label, which meant that the band was able to freely select which songs would make the cut. However, several producers were unwilling to work with the group, as they weren&#x27;t sent to them via a record label. Despite the band switching labels, they still retained their manager and mentor from Trans Continental, Johnny Wright, and stayed at his ranch in Orlando, Florida. Through Jive, the band was introduced to American record producer Teddy Riley, who would remake Johnny Kemp&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Just Got Paid&quot; with them, and Kevin &quot;She&#x27;kspere&quot; Briggs, who produced &quot;It Makes Me Ill&quot; for the album. One of the recording sessions for the album took place in a tiny studio in Burbank. Recording of &quot;Just Got Paid&quot; pushed the album&#x27;s in-store release date of March 7, 2000 to the new date of March 21, 2000. The ballad &quot;That&#x27;s When I&#x27;ll Stop Loving You&quot;, written by Diane Warren, was recorded there under the production of French-born producer Guy Roche in 1999.

Accordingly, NSYNC insisted that they choose producers and songwriters for the album. On &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, the band commissioned Swedish and German songwriters and producers, who had produced songs for the Backstreet Boys. Aside from getting a number-one album on the chart, the group wanted to distinguish their music from the style of the Backstreet Boys, with whom they had shared the same producers. To that end, they told the Swedish team of Cheiron Studios to change the band&#x27;s tune. Wright recalls, &quot;We basically told them, &#x27;We like your concepts for songs and we love the way you produce. But you&#x27;re gonna have to do it in a different way so that it conforms to how we want our sound to be.&quot; This direction resulted to harder-edge songs such as &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot;, which production was handled by the Swedish team. Max Martin, who also came from Cheiron and was known for producing songs for NSYNC&#x27;s label mates, also contributed to the album by co-writing the single &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot;. Martin was initially hesitant to provide the group his music due to the ongoing lawsuit, but relented when Wright pleaded for him to allow NSYNC to perform them at the Radio Music Awards, indicating that it could be the final time fans could see them perform.

Despite the new direction the band had wanted to take, the early recording process found some of the producers and writers submitting tracks which were &quot;in the vein of NSYNC&#x27;s earlier, softer sound&quot;. The band thought that if the collaborators could not produce what they were looking for, they would find it themselves. This resulted in some of the band members contributing to a number of tracks on the album. On specific songs, songwriter and producer Veit Renn collaborated with band member JC Chasez, who co-authored the album&#x27;s title track and three other songs. Meanwhile, Justin Timberlake helped pen and produce the album&#x27;s track &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Good for You&quot;. Lastly, another song that made the record was &quot;Digital Get Down&quot;, a song about videophone sex that &quot;TV Guide&quot; described as &quot;hailing the joys of cybersex. Do they think the braces brigade in &#x27;N Sync&#x27;s audience will recognize the R-rated oomph?&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
Timberlake said that the album is a diverse body of work that explores dimensions of R&amp;B within pop music. He added that the album &quot;goes totally mainstream and it goes into some dance- and club-style songs&quot;. There are few mid-tempo songs and ballads on &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, a result of the band&#x27;s desire to have a &quot;fun&quot; album. The album did, however, retain the pop style of its predecessor. According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the album&#x27;s musical style is that of Top 40, with a funky beat, while &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;Millennial interpretations of New Jack Swing, and staccato rap-adjacent flows that were previously made mainstream by Destiny&#x27;s Child and TLC&quot;. Chasez also stated that the album is &quot;in your face&quot;, comparing the album&#x27;s &quot;chopped and punched&quot; production to the discography of Michael Jackson.

In his article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jon Pareles wrote in 2000:

Flush with artistic freedom, &#x27;N Sync heads straight for the past: specifically the 1980s rhythm-and-blues that sought to balance pretty melody atop hip-hop&#x27;s street-level beat. Like the Rolling Stones discovering 1950s Chicago blues, &#x27;N Sync has latched onto the highly synthesized, jigsaw rhythms of 1980s phenomena from Michael Jackson to New Edition to Zapp. In a direct tribute to the new jack swing of the 1980s, &#x27;N Sync remakes Johnny Kemp&#x27;s 1988 hit &quot;Just Got Paid&quot; with its original producer, Teddy Riley.
Writing about &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, music critics noted that the song &quot;Digital Get Down&quot; is about video cybersex, which is a clear indicator of post-pubescent consciousness of the group. In the article &quot;Parents&#x27; Guide&quot; published in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Lois Alter Mark analyzed the contents of new albums during the time, stating that the album&#x27;s recurring theme is about puppy love, and has sexual content that is categorized as mildly suggestive and a language that is preteen friendly. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the &quot;futuristic synth-driven&quot; song as &quot;an eruption of hormones and harmonies all at once, with three and a half minutes of big beats and grown-up innuendo&quot;. The European album edition&#x27;s second single &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Stop&quot; is considered by Al Shipley of &quot;Billboard&quot; to closely resemble the band&#x27;s Europop sounding debut album, while &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Good For You&quot; is a soulful track that samples &quot;Believe in Love&quot; by Teddy Pendergrass. Both &quot;Space Cowboy (Yippie-Yi-Yay)&quot; and &quot;It Makes Me Ill&quot; were considered by Al Shipley of &quot;Billboard&quot; as deep-cut songs which attracted &quot;the young fans who made teen pop into a cottage industry&quot;, noting that Ariana Grande, an &quot;attentive student of early 2000s pop/R&amp;B crossover&quot;, quoted the lyrics of the latter on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number two single &quot;Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I&#x27;m Bored&quot;. NSYNC was also inspired by the hip-hop genre, incorporating beat-box type vocals in &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot;, semi-rapping in &quot;Just Got Paid&quot;, and percussion in &quot;Bringin&#x27; Da Noise&quot;.

==Promotion==

&quot;No Strings Attached&quot; was initially planned for release from September to November 1999. However, because of the ongoing legal battle between NSYNC and its management, the album was delayed several times, which included a release on November 16. This caused fan interest in the album to grow, as coverage of the lawsuit was televised on MTV. Towards the end of 1999, it was reported that a settlement had been reached, putting aside the lawsuit that their management had filed. The settlement allowed the band to freely release the album under their current name with a release date set for March 7, 2000. &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot; was distributed to radio stations on January 17, 2000, the same night NSYNC performed the song at the American Music Awards of 2000.

&quot;No Strings Attached&quot; was initially scheduled to be released in stores on March 7, 2000, but NSYNC decided to record &quot;Just Got Paid&quot; with Teddy Riley, which delayed the album to March 21, 2000. NSYNC made several media appearances prior to its release, including on MTV, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and the Oscars. They also appeared on several advertisements for Verizon Wireless and Chili&#x27;s, where they promoted the release date. The &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot; music video was heavily rotated, which Richard Skanse of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described as &quot;seemingly every other half-hour&quot; on MTV. Former MTV chairman and CEO Tom Freston praised NSYNC&#x27;s accessibility to cater towards audiences by using &quot;heavy video rotation [and] mini-biographies&quot; in addition to backstage studio environments including &quot;the Super Bowl [and] &quot;Total Request Live&quot; (&quot;TRL&quot;)&quot;.
Prior to its release, tracks from &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; were leaked on the internet. The leaks were perceived by Wright to assist NSYNC in reaching the sales record that held by the album, describing it as an opportunity for the listeners to hear more than what the radio was playing. No commercial singles for any song were distributed prior to the release of &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; in order to increase demand. On the album&#x27;s release date, NSYNC appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in the morning, where their performance was broadcast on the jumbotron in Times Square. They appeared on &quot;TRL&quot; in the afternoon, then walked over to the Virgin Megastore, where they were greeted by 8,000 fans, 250 who slept outside overnight. The store underestimated the volume of people who would appear, forcing them to close down twice in the same day; firstly to let a few hundred in at a time, then to prepare for NSYNC&#x27;s meet-and-greet that evening. Former Virgin regional manager Andy Moreno attributed the influx of people at the store to the Internet, as they heard about the event through chat rooms and websites.

===No Strings Attached Tour===

NSYNC embarked on their second tour titled the No Strings Attached Tour in support of the album, which was sponsored by MCY.com and Nabisco, and produced by SFX Touring. One million tickets were sold during the first day of availability, with all 50 initial dates sold out. It began at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi, Mississippi on May 9, 2000. When the tour ended in December 2000, it became the second highest-grossing tour in North America that year, earning more than $70 million.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that NSYNC &quot;might sound the same as ever&quot; to critics, but acknowledged that &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; &quot;blows away their previous record&quot;. He added that it &quot;pulls away from the standard dance-pop formula&quot;. Pareles compared the band&#x27;s vocals to groups such as Boyz II Men, Jodeci, and Dru Hill, but praised Chasez&#x27;s collaborations for showing hints of &quot;nuttiness&quot; and creativity. Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention and defined the beats as &quot;their statement, the ballads their way of life&quot;. Sputnikmusic emeritus Morrissey opined that &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; contained &quot;few outstanding pop tracks, and little to no filler&quot; but described the overall album as &quot;enjoyable from start to finish&quot;. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne criticized the album for being &quot;overstuffed with tracks clearly concocted with the concert stage in mind&quot; and described the tracks as &quot;synthetic-funk spectacles&quot;, but praised the group&#x27;s best performances on the album for &quot;arriv[ing] only when they drop the pretenses&quot;. Browne&#x27;s album rating was received poorly by NSYNC fans, with one fan describing his review as &quot;totally uncool&quot; in their letter to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in April 2000.

&quot;No Strings Attached&quot; was nominated in the category for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. At the 2000 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, the album led NSYNC to receive four awards in categories such as Album of the Year and Top 40 Artist of the Year.

==Commercial performance==
Many retailers around the United States had predicted that, &quot;with an impressive show of sales strength&quot;, &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; could &quot;culminate into the biggest first week ever in the SoundScan era&quot;. Jive Records had already shipped 9.2 million units of the album, and reorders were already made shortly after the album&#x27;s release in record stores. At online retailer Amazon, advance sales for the album were the biggest at the time. Meanwhile, orders for the album were aggressive in the West Coast. Some stores stayed opened until midnight specifically for the album. According to Pareles, the sales of &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; were &quot;a tribute to Jive Records&#x27; skill at building anticipation&quot; for the album. The strength of its lead single and music video, &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot;, and Internet song previews for the album provided for the build up. Both Jive Records and the band&#x27;s management credited the album&#x27;s early success to the anticipation amassed over the two years since they released their self-titled debut album, the highly publicized legal battle and the media blitz leading up to the release. Despite the mania that &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; stirred in the wake of its debut, MTV reported the &quot;record week may not have been simply the result of a wide fan base and effective marketing&quot;. Several NSYNC fans bought numerous copies of the album &quot;to have more than one&quot; and with the intent for NSYNC to &quot;break the Backstreet Boys&#x27; sales record&quot;, as their second studio album &quot;Millennium&quot;, sold more than 1.13 million copies in its first week in 1999.

&quot;No Strings Attached&quot; sold over 2.4 million copies in the United States during its first week, setting the record as the first album to have sold more than two million copies in a single week since the chart adopted Nielsen SoundScan data in May 1991. This record was later recognized at the 2000 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. The album held the record for 15 years after its release, until it was surpassed by Adele&#x27;s third studio album &quot;25&quot; on November 23, 2015, which sold over 2.433 million albums in the United States within three days of its release. The figures surpassed the album&#x27;s successor &quot;Celebrity&quot;″s debut sales of over 1.88 million units, retaining the recognition as NSYNC&#x27;s highest-debut in their career. Chartwise, the album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number one. It topped the chart for eight consecutive weeks, becoming one of the longest-running number-one albums of 2000. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; nine-times Platinum on April 19, 2000, becoming the highest-certified single disc album in the initial RIAA audit in that year. It broke the record previously set in 1993 by &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; soundtrack, which was certified six-times Platinum in the RIAA&#x27;s first audit. &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; shipped 10 million copies domestically in 2000 alone, of which 9,936,104 were sold, according to Nielsen Soundscan. This consequently made &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; the highest-selling album of 2000 in the United States. As of October 2014, &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; sold 11.16 million copies per SoundScan. An additional 1.52 million copies sold through the BMG Music Club are not included in SoundScan&#x27;s total. In 2000, &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; was ranked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 year end chart. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; was the top album of the decade.

==Legacy==
By status, NSYNC were considered a clone of the Backstreet Boys. With the success that the band attained with &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, that notion was obliterated, even calling them as a serious rival with their label mate. On November 21, 2000, the Backstreet Boys issued their follow-up album &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot;, which sold 1.6 million in its debut week domestically, alongside selling 5 million copies worldwide. According to Richard Skanse of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the album gave the group its landmark achievement. For Janet Kleinbaum, Jive&#x27;s then-Vice President of Artist Marketing, the &quot;yardstick is definitely extended&quot;, referring to the record by which future releases of Jive would have to be compared with. After &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, Jive&#x27;s other popular artists at the time such as Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys were each releasing an album. Kleinbaum thought, &quot;We know now what the possibilities are. We&#x27;re not going to compare a Britney Spears record to NSYNC, or Backstreet Boys. However, NSYNC has shown us what can be done.&quot;

Referring to the first day sale of the album with 1.1 million units, Josh Wolk of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that it was &quot;perhaps the greatest mass spending of allowances in history&quot;. Craig Seymour of the same publication said, &quot;What has the industry buzzing is not only that 2.4 million fans rushed to the stores, but that teen-pop behemoth Jive Records was in a unique and almost unprecedented position to meet the stores&#x27; demand&quot;. This demand on physical copies of the album was met by Jive by shelving up millions of units leading to the album&#x27;s release date. The label was able to ship 4.2 million copies for the album&#x27;s official release date, then couriered another 2.3 million in reorders the next day on March 22, 2000. Retailer Grandoni said, &quot;If they hadn&#x27;t been ready for it, stores would have sold out after a couple days which would have limited their first-week sales&quot;.

The teen pop trend reached a climax following the peak of &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, where customers moved from CDs to peer-to-peer file sharing such as Napster and LimeWire. Kirkpatrick reflected twenty years later; &quot;We were ahead of the trend when we came out [...] and then the trends caught up, because that&#x27;s what trends do&quot;. &quot;NPR&quot; wrote that the album has stood the test of time today, stating that &quot;a union of Swedish pop songcraft with R&amp;B and hip-hop&#x27;s flow and bounce; an eagerness to explore mature themes and styles; an understanding that dance and visual presentation can turn stars into icons&quot;. Writing for &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, Anna Rahmanan stated that South Korean boy band BTS have followed in NSYNC&#x27;s footsteps in crossing music genres, as their initial start as a hip hop group had led them to branch out into different genres such as K-pop, EDM, and R&amp;B. She complimented their adaptability by &quot;tearing a page out of &#x27;N Sync&#x27;s playbook&quot;, while simultaneously showcasing their originality. &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; was ranked 111th on the &quot;Billboard Top 200 Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="195641" wikidata="Q212326" url="?curid=195641" title="MTV Unplugged in New York">
<text>MTV Unplugged in New York is the first live album by the American rock band Nirvana, released by DGC Records on November 1, 1994, nearly seven months following the suicide of Kurt Cobain. It was part of the cable television series &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; and features a mostly acoustic performance. It was recorded at Sony Music Studios in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan, on November 18, 1993&quot;.&quot;

The show was directed by Beth McCarthy and aired on the cable television network MTV on December 16, 1993. In a break with &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; tradition, Nirvana used some electric amplification and effects, and played mainly lesser-known material and covers, with performances of songs by the Vaselines, David Bowie, Lead Belly and Meat Puppets. They were joined by the rhythm guitarist Pat Smear and the cellist Lori Goldston, alongside Meat Puppets members Cris and Curt Kirkwood for some songs.

&quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; was released after plans to release the performance as part of a live album, &quot;Verse Chorus Verse,&quot; were abandoned. It debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2020. It won the Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards, Nirvana&#x27;s only Grammy Award. It was released on DVD in 2007.

== Background ==
&quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; began airing on MTV in 1989, with artists performing their hits on acoustic instruments in intimate settings. Nirvana had been in negotiations to appear for some time; Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain finally accepted while touring with the Meat Puppets. Nirvana wanted to do something different from a typical &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance; according to drummer Dave Grohl, &quot;We&#x27;d seen the other &quot;Unpluggeds&quot; and didn&#x27;t like many of them, because most bands would treat them like rock shows—play their hits like it was Madison Square Garden, except with acoustic guitars.&quot;

The group looked at Mark Lanegan&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;The Winding Sheet&quot;, which Cobain had performed on, for inspiration. Among the ideas the band members came up with included covering David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; and inviting members of the Meat Puppets to join them on stage. Still, the prospect of an entirely acoustic show reportedly made Cobain nervous.

== Rehearsal ==
Nirvana rehearsed for two days, at SST Rehearsal Facility, in Weehawken, New Jersey. The rehearsals were tense and difficult, with the band running into problems performing various songs. During the sessions, Cobain disagreed with MTV about the performance. Producer Alex Coletti recalled that the network was unhappy with the lack of hit Nirvana songs, and with the choice of the Meat Puppets as guests, saying: &quot;They wanted to hear the &#x27;right&#x27; names – Eddie Vedder or Tori Amos or God knows who.&quot;

The day before filming, Cobain refused to play, but he appeared at the studio the following afternoon. Cobain was suffering from drug withdrawal and nervousness at the time; one observer said, &quot;There was no joking, no smiles, no fun coming from him ... everyone was more than a little worried about his performance.&quot;

== Recording ==

Nirvana taped their performance on November 18, 1993, at Sony Studios in New York City. Cobain suggested the stage be decorated with stargazer lilies, black candles, and a crystal chandelier. Coletti asked, &quot;You mean like a funeral?&quot; Cobain replied, &quot;Exactly. Like a funeral.&quot;

Nirvana was joined by guitarist Pat Smear and cellist Lori Goldston, who had been touring with them. Despite the show&#x27;s acoustic premise, Cobain insisted on running his acoustic guitar through his amplifier and effects pedals. Coletti built a fake box in front of the amplifier to disguise it as a monitor wedge. Coletti said, &quot;It was Kurt&#x27;s security blanket. He was used to hearing this guitar through his Fender. He wanted those effects. You can hear it on &#x27;The Man Who Sold the World&#x27;. It&#x27;s an acoustic guitar, but he&#x27;s obviously going through an amp.&quot;

Unlike many artists who appeared on the show, Nirvana filmed the entire performance of 14 songs in a single take. It included one song from their debut &quot;Bleach&quot; (1989), four from their second album &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991), three from the recently released &quot;In Utero&quot;, and six covers. As &quot;In Utero&#x27;s&quot; &quot;All Apologies&quot; had not yet been released as a single, the only contemporary hit the band performed was the &quot;Nevermind&quot; single &quot;Come as You Are&quot;.

Cris and Curt Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets joined to perform three of their songs with Nirvana. &quot;Kurt purposely wanted the Meat Puppets songs to be a struggle for him vocally,&quot; remarked Coletti. &quot;So instead of finding a key he could sing them in comfortably, he chose to strain.&quot;

The set ended with a performance of the traditional &quot;Where Did You Sleep Last Night&quot;, following the arrangement of blues musician Lead Belly, whom Cobain described before the song as &quot;his favorite performer ever&quot;. Mark Lanegan had covered this song previously on &quot;The Winding Sheet&quot; (1990) with Cobain on guitar. After the band finished, Cobain argued with the show&#x27;s producers, who wanted an encore. Cobain refused because he felt he could not top the performance of that song.

== Releases ==
The Nirvana episode of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; was broadcast in December 1993. It was 45 minutes long and omitted the songs &quot;Something in the Way&quot; and &quot;Oh Me&quot;. After Cobain died in April 1994, MTV aired the episode repeatedly. To meet demand for new Nirvana material and to counter bootlegging, in August 1994, DGC announced a double album, &quot;Verse Chorus Verse&quot;, comprising live performances including the entire &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance. However, the task of compiling the album was too emotionally difficult for Novoselic and Grohl, so the project was cancelled a week after the announcement; the group opted to release just the &quot;Unplugged&quot; performance. Scott Litt, who produced the performance, returned to produce the record.

The performance was released on DVD on November 20, 2007. The DVD release featured the entire taping, in 5.1 DTS surround sound, including the two songs (&quot;Something in the Way&quot; and &quot;Oh Me&quot;) excluded from the broadcast version. Bonus features consisted of the original broadcast version of the performance, a 1999 MTV special titled &quot;Bare Witness: Nirvana Unplugged&quot; featuring the recollections of MTV producers and audience members, and five full-band songs taped during the pre-show rehearsal: &quot;Come as You Are&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot;, &quot;Plateau&quot;, &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;, and &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; was released on November 1, 1994. It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 310,500 copies, the highest first-week sales of Nirvana&#x27;s career. By March 1995, the album had outsold &quot;In Utero&quot; with 6.8 million copies sold.

The album received positive reviews from critics. Tom Hibbert of &quot;Q&quot; said that as an acoustic ensemble, Nirvana sounded &quot;most moving, possessed of a ragged glory&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Barbara O&#x27;Dair found the record &quot;stirring and occasionally brilliant&quot; with &quot;spare and gorgeous spots everywhere&quot;, highlighting the band&#x27;s chemistry on &quot;All Apologies&quot; and Cobain&#x27;s unaccompanied performance of &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;. Ben Thompson from &quot;Mojo&quot; felt that unlike most &quot;unplugged&quot; releases, the format&#x27;s &quot;colourless, generic aspect&quot; and not seeing the actual performance benefits Nirvana&#x27;s record because of how intense it seems in light of Cobain&#x27;s death. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne felt unsettled listening to it: &quot;Beyond inducing a sense of loss for Cobain himself, &quot;Unplugged&quot; elicits a feeling of musical loss, too: the delicacy and intimacy of these acoustic rearrangements hint at where Nirvana (or at least Cobain, who was said to be frustrated with the limitations of the band) could have gone.&quot;

&quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; was voted the fourth-best album of the year in Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of prominent American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s supervisor, also ranked the album fourth in his own year-end list, deeming it a testament to Cobain&#x27;s depth of feeling, &quot;sincerity&quot; as a vocalist, and distinction from other sensitive alternative rock types such as Eddie Vedder and Lou Barlow: &quot;The vocal performance he evokes is John Lennon&#x27;s on &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot;. And he did it in one take.&quot;

===Retrospective===
In a retrospective review for AllMusic, senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; was &quot;fearlessly confessional&quot;, as it found Nirvana and Cobain &quot;on the verge of discovering a new sound and style&quot;. Jason Mendelsohn from &quot;PopMatters&quot; believed its intimate folk rock quality was radical from Nirvana and Cobain, &quot;as crass of a business move as it was&quot; by their record label. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), journalist Charles M. Young called it Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;second masterpiece&quot; after &quot;Nevermind&quot;, and claimed that Cobain could have &quot;revolutionized folk music the same way he had rock&quot; because of his striking voice; he said his songs worked equally well with &quot;a loud band bashing away behind you&quot; or &quot;with just an acoustic guitar&quot;. Maeve McDermott of &quot;USA Today&quot; called it &quot;an album of transcendent folk rock that glimpsed what could&#x27;ve been the band&#x27;s next post-grunge era, had frontman Kurt Cobain survived long enough to see its musical leanings through.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; had become &quot;inextricably linked&quot; to Cobain&#x27;s death a few months after its recording, citing the funereal set design and the sense that Nirvana was &quot;on the verge of a new musical direction, beyond their grunge roots&quot;. It named an image from the performance an &quot;era-defining photograph&quot;. In 2007, the BBC Two series &quot;Seven Ages of Rock&quot; called Nirvana&#x27;s performance of &quot;Where Did You Sleep Last Night&quot; a surreal requiem for Cobain. A 2013 article by critic Andrew Wallace Chamings in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described it as one of the greatest live performances of all time:

In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; number 313 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. The 2020 edition of the list placed it at number 279. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also named it the 95th best album of the 1990s. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted it the 8th-best live album. &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; the greatest live album in 2011, and &quot;Kerrang&quot; listed it among the 11 best live albums of all time. In 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked named &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; one of the &quot;50 iconic albums that defined 1994&quot;, and in 2019 named it one of the best live albums. In 2020, &quot;the Telegraph&quot; named it the 13th-greatest live albums of all time, and 2020, &quot;Planet Rock&quot; named it one of the 100 greatest live albums. It was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Reviewing the DVD release in 2007, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that it &quot;deserves a place on the rock TV history shelf alongside the informal, sit-down section of Elvis Presley&#x27;s epic comeback special in 1968&quot;. 

In June 2016, the 1959 Martin D-18E guitar used by Cobain at the &quot;Unplugged&quot; concert was legally transferred by Cobain&#x27;s daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, as a gift to her husband, Isaiah Silva, the frontman of rock band the Eeries. After their divorce, Frances and Cobain&#x27;s widow, Courtney Love, tried to retrieve it. Love called the guitar a &quot;treasured heirloom&quot; and said it was “not [Silva&#x27;s] to take&quot;. In 2018, during their divorce settlement proceedings, the court rejected Silva&#x27;s request for spousal support, ownership of their house and reimbursement of his legal fees but awarded him the guitar. In 2020, it was sold at Julien&#x27;s Auctions for US$6 million to Peter Freedman of Røde Microphones, making it the most expensive guitar ever sold at auction.

<text>Surrealistic Pillow is the second studio album by the American rock band Jefferson Airplane, released on February 1, 1967, by RCA Victor. It is the first album by the band with vocalist Grace Slick and drummer Spencer Dryden. The album peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is considered to be one of the most influential and quintessential works of the early psychedelic rock era and 1960s counterculture.

&quot;My Best Friend&quot; was released as the first single in December 1966 but only reached No. 103 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under chart. Two more singles were released in the spring of 1967: &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit&quot; peaked respectively at number five and number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and are the band&#x27;s only Top 40 hits on that chart. &quot;Today&quot; was not released as a single but was played often on college radio and rock stations and remains one of their most popular songs. It was also recorded by jazz saxophonist Tom Scott for his 1967 album &quot;The Honeysuckle Breeze&quot;; this version was sampled in the song &quot;They Reminisce Over You&quot; by Pete Rock &amp; C.L. Smooth.

In 2024, the album was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” to American recorded music.

==Background==
Early drummer Alexander &quot;Skip&quot; Spence left the band in mid-1966. He was soon replaced by Spencer Dryden, an experienced Los Angeles jazz drummer and the half-nephew of Charlie Chaplin. New female vocalist Grace Slick, formerly with another San Francisco rock band the Great Society, joined the Airplane in October 1966. Slick, Dryden, male lead vocalist-guitarist-songwriter and founder of band Marty Balin, guitarist-vocalist-songwriter Paul Kantner, lead guitarist (and occasional vocalist) Jorma Kaukonen, and bassist Jack Casady formed the core of the best-known line-up of the group, which remained stable until Dryden&#x27;s departure in early 1970.

==Songs and recording==

A mere two weeks after Grace Slick joined the band, the group entered RCA Victor studios in Hollywood on October 31 to record their second album. Working with producer Rick Jarrard, the group recorded album opener &quot;She Has Funny Cars&quot; featuring Jack Casady on fuzz bass and the mellow folk-rocker &quot;My Best Friend&quot;, written by departed member Skip Spence and chosen as the album&#x27;s lead-off single. On November 1 they recorded Balin&#x27;s &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot;, his ode to a television set penned after a visit to a plastics factory in Chicago while the band was on tour. This was followed the next day by his love ballad &quot;Today&quot;, which purportedly featured Jerry Garcia on lead guitar (see below), laid down in a single take and soon to be a popular live staple. On November 3 a Slick composition she brought from her time in The Great Society, &quot;White Rabbit&quot;, was recorded with its original instrumental introduction drastically shortened for commercial purposes; it was among the first explicitly pro-drug rock songs and would go on to become her signature piece, used in countless movies and TV shows since. On the next day the Balin rocker &quot;3/5 Of A Mile In 10 Seconds&quot;, which the band had already been featuring in its shows since September, was committed to tape. Marty claimed the title came from seeing two different phrases in the sports section of the newspaper, one for &quot;3/5 of a mile&quot; and another for &quot;10 seconds&quot;, which he combined at random. The high price of &quot;real clean, real fine nicotine&quot; in the lyrics was a veiled reference to marijuana.

After a short break to play some gigs the group reconvened at RCA on November 14 to record another Spence composition, &quot;J.P.P. McStep B. Blues&quot;, which was ultimately left in the can; the group would sporadically play it on stage, sometimes in a medley with the later &quot;Wooden Ships&quot;. Spence was present for this session, which also saw the recording of The Mamas &amp; the Papas soundalike &quot;How Do You Feel&quot; written by Kantner friend Tom Mastin. On the following day &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, another song from the Great Society penned by Slick&#x27;s brother-in-law Darby and given a new, punchier arrangement by Garcia, was captured in 13 takes along with Kantner&#x27;s chiming, Byrdsian folk-rocker &quot;D.C.B.A.-25&quot; (the title referring to the song&#x27;s chord progression, with the number 25 an oblique reference to LSD-25). On November 16 the band recorded Balin&#x27;s &quot;Comin&#x27; Back to Me&quot;, a gentle acoustic-baroque ballad penned that very day after having smoked a particularly strong joint given to him by Paul Butterfield and featuring only himself, Casady, and Garcia plus Slick on recorder, as they were the only musicians left in the studio that night.&quot; Two outtakes, the driving Kantner-Estes acid-rocker &quot;Go To Her&quot; (which had also been attempted for the debut album) and slow Kaukonen blues &quot;In The Morning&quot;, were taped on the 17th and 21st with the album&#x27;s final song, the acoustic fingerpicking showcase &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot; penned by Kaukonen some five years prior, added on November 22 at the insistence of Jarrard.

As producer, Jarrard was under orders by RCA to produce something commercial, so none of the longer covers and psychedelic instrumental jams the group had been featuring on stage, such as &quot;Fat Angel&quot;, &quot;Thing&quot;, and &quot;The Other Side Of This Life&quot;, were attempted. He forbade the group to smoke marijuana at the sessions, an edict that was ignored and which contributed to the group not re-hiring him for subsequent albums; they disparaged him behind his back as a company man, although Slick stated she was &quot;knocked out&quot; when she heard the final product. Jarrard also bathed the stereo mix of the album in swathes of reverb, a controversial choice which has led some to prefer the drier mono mix.

Some controversy exists as to the role of Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia in the making of the album. His reputed presence on several tracks is denied by producer Jarrard, but he is credited on the RCA label copy and received credits on the &quot;Flight Log&quot; compilation and the &quot;Jefferson Airplane Loves You&quot; box set. In the sleeve notes for &quot;Early Flight&quot;, a 1974 compilation album of previously unreleased material, manager Bill Thompson writes only that Garcia was &quot;listed as &#x27;spiritual advisor&#x27; on the album cover [and] played one of the guitars&quot; on &quot;In the Morning&quot;. Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he played the high lead on &quot;Today&quot; in addition to playing guitar on two other songs (&quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot; and &quot;Comin&#x27; Back to Me&quot;) and rearranging &quot;Somebody to Love.&quot; He also played on &quot;J.P.P. McStep B. Blues&quot; (included on &quot;Early Flight&quot; and the 2003 CD reissue) and may have also played on &quot;How Do You Feel&quot;. Kaukonen has opined that Garcia was essentially the producer who arranged the songs for the group. More recently, in his biography, he says, &quot;I used to think about him as co-producer, but now that I really know what a producer is, the producer of that record was Rick Jarrard. Jerry was a combination arranger, musician, and sage counsel.&quot;

==Title and artwork==
San Francisco photographer Herb Greene photographed the band for the album&#x27;s cover art in his dining room, whose walls were covered in primitive quasi-hieroglyphics. Marty Balin had wanted the cover tinted in blue but RCA overrode him and chose pink instead, although he liked the change. The back cover was a psychedelic photo collage of the band members picked from shots taken at the same Greene photo session, also assembled by Balin. A comment to Marty by Garcia about the music being &quot;as surrealistic as a pillow&quot; inspired the album title.

==Release==

The album was initially released on LP record by RCA Victor in different stereo (LSP-3766), and mono (LPM-3766) editions. The stereo mixes include heavier use of reverberation effects than the mono. The mono version was deleted in the late 1960s and remained unavailable until 2001. The first United Kingdom release replaced some original songs with tracks from the group&#x27;s first US LP, &quot;Jefferson Airplane Takes Off&quot;.

The album was initially slow to take off until the release of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; in March. Heavy radio play took the song into the Billboard top 5, aided by the group&#x27;s first national TV appearances on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; on May 7 and &quot;American Bandstand&quot; on June 3, the former appearance featuring a facsimile of the group&#x27;s swirling light show, the first time the average American had seen such effects. The album entered the Billboard top 10 in May and peaked at #3 on August 5, with the help of the follow up single &quot;White Rabbit&quot;.

Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s fusion of folk rock and psychedelia was original at the time, in line with musical developments pioneered by the Byrds, the Beach Boys, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, Bob Dylan, the Yardbirds, and the Beatles, among other mid-1960s rock bands. &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; was the first blockbuster psychedelic album by a band from San Francisco, announcing to the world the active bohemian scene that had developed there starting with the Beats during the 1950s, extending and changing through the 1960s into the Haight-Ashbury counterculture. Subsequent exposure generated by the Airplane and others wrought great changes to the counterculture. By 1968, the ensuing national media attention had precipitated a very different San Francisco scene than had existed in 1966.

In January 2017, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America, while &quot;White Rabbit&quot; received a platinum certification.

==Critical reception==
On initial release, the album received positive reviews. &quot;Billboard&quot; said of &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; that it was a &quot;hard driver, featuring powerful female vocal lead, that never stops from start to finish.&quot; Similarly, the magazine said of &quot;White Rabbit&quot; that it was a &quot;change-of-pace number&quot; with &quot;intriguing lyric content and driving beat in strong support.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; wrote of the album that &quot;the LP could easily go all the way to the top of the chart&quot; and &quot;should be especially popular with the teen set.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave it a B+ although he critiqued the lyrics, claiming &quot;the sarcasm is as vapid as the optimism.&quot;

A live version of &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot; was released as a single in 1969. &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;heavy hard rock.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; wrote that it &quot;features the team&#x27;s more commercial-than-controversial style&quot; and has &quot;a solid instrumental track and very fine vocal.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; wrote it was one of the band&#x27;s favorites.

In subsequent years the reputation of the album has continued to grow, with &quot;AllMusic&quot; giving it five stars and claiming it was a &quot;shot heard around the world&quot; and that &quot;the group never made a better album, and few artists from the era ever did.&quot; In 2003, the album was ranked number 146 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and dropping to number 471 in the 2020 revised list. It was voted number 174 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

===Reissues===
The first compact disc releases were in Japan in 1987 and the U.S. in 1988. A 2001 re-issue by RCA was released as a limited edition gold CD and contained both the stereo and mono recordings. Both mixes were later included as part of the &quot;Ignition&quot; box set on a standard aluminum CD.

Another stereo reissue appeared on August 19, 2003, with six bonus tracks, including the mono A-sides of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit.&quot; The 2003 reissue was produced by Bob Irwin.

<doc id="195645" wikidata="Q154269" url="?curid=195645" title="Alexei Leonov">
<text>Alexei Arkhipovich Leonov (30 May 1934 – 11 October 2019) was a Soviet and Russian cosmonaut and aviator, Air Force major general, writer, and artist. On 18 March 1965, he became the first person to conduct a spacewalk, exiting the capsule during the Voskhod 2 mission for 12 minutes and 9 seconds. He was also selected to be the first Soviet person to land on the Moon although the project was cancelled.

In July 1975, Leonov commanded the Soyuz capsule in the Apollo–Soyuz mission, which docked in space for two days with an American Apollo capsule.

Leonov was twice Hero of the Soviet Union (1965, 1975), a Major General of Aviation (1975), laureate of the USSR State Prize (1981), and a member of the Supreme Council of the United Russia party (2002–2019).

== Early life and military service ==
Leonov was born on 30 May 1934 in Listvyanka, West Siberian Krai, Russian SFSR, in a Russian family. His grandfather had been forced to relocate to Siberia for his role in the 1905 Russian Revolution. Alexei was the eighth of nine surviving children born to Yevdokia and Arkhip. His father was an electrician and miner.

In 1936, his father was arrested and declared an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;. Leonov wrote in his autobiography: &quot;He was not alone: many were being arrested. It was part of a conscientious drive by the authorities to eradicate anyone who showed too much independence or strength of character. These were the years of Stalin&#x27;s purges. Many disappeared into remote gulags and were never seen again.&quot;

The family moved in with one of his married sisters in Kemerovo. His father rejoined the family in Kemerovo after he was released. He was compensated for his wrongful imprisonment. Leonov used art as a way to provide more food for the family. He began his art career by drawing flowers on ovens and later painted landscapes on canvasses.

The Soviet government encouraged its citizens to move to Soviet-occupied Prussia, so in 1948 his family relocated to Kaliningrad. Leonov graduated from secondary school (No. 21) in 1953. He applied to the Academy of Arts in Riga, Latvia, but decided not to attend due to the high tuition costs. Leonov decided to join a Ukrainian preparatory flying school in Kremenchug. He made his first solo flight in May 1955. While indulging in his passion for art by studying part-time in Riga, Leonov started an advanced two-year course to become a fighter pilot at the Chuguev Higher Air Force Pilots School in the Ukrainian SSR.

On 30 October 1957, Leonov graduated with an honours degree and was commissioned a lieutenant in the 113th Parachute Aviation Regiment, part of the 10th Engineering Aviation Division of the 69th Air Army in Kyiv. On 13 December 1959, he married Svetlana Pavlovna Dozenko. The next day he moved to East Germany to his new assignment with the 294th Reconnaissance Regiment of the 24th Air Army.

== Soviet space program==
He was one of the 20 Soviet Air Forces pilots selected to be part of the first cosmonaut training group in 1960. As with most cosmonauts, Leonov was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. His walk in space was originally to have taken place on the Voskhod 1 mission, but this was cancelled, and the historic event happened on the Voskhod 2 flight instead. He was outside the spacecraft for 12 minutes and nine seconds on 18 March 1965, connected to the craft by a tether.

At the end of the spacewalk, Leonov&#x27;s spacesuit had inflated in the vacuum of space to the point where he could not re-enter the airlock. He opened a valve to allow some of the suit&#x27;s pressure to bleed off and was barely able to get back inside the capsule. While on the mission, Leonov drew a small sketch of an orbital sunrise, the first work of art made in outer space. Leonov had spent eighteen months undergoing weightlessness training for the mission.

In 1968, Leonov was selected to be commander of a circumlunar Soyuz 7K-L1 flight. This was cancelled because of delays in achieving a reliable circumlunar flight (only the later Zond 7 and Zond 8 members of the programme were successful) and the Apollo 8 mission had already achieved that step in the Space Race. He was also selected to be the first Soviet person to land on the Moon, aboard the LOK/N1 spacecraft. This project was also cancelled. (The design required a spacewalk between lunar vehicles, something that contributed to his selection.) Leonov was to have been commander of the 1971 Soyuz 11 mission to Salyut 1, the first crewed space station, but his crew was replaced with the backup after one of the members, cosmonaut Valery Kubasov, was suspected to have contracted tuberculosis (the other member was Pyotr Kolodin).

Leonov was to have commanded the next mission to Salyut 1, but this was scrapped after the deaths of the Soyuz 11 crew members, and the space station was lost. The next two Salyuts (actually the military Almaz station) were lost at launch or failed soon after, and Leonov&#x27;s crew stood by. By the time Salyut 4 reached orbit, Leonov had been switched to a more prestigious project.

Leonov&#x27;s second trip into space was as commander of Soyuz 19, the Soviet half of the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission—the first joint space mission between the Soviet Union and the United States.
During the project Leonov became lasting friends with the US commander Thomas P. Stafford, with Leonov being the godfather of Stafford&#x27;s younger children. Stafford gave a eulogy in Russian at Leonov&#x27;s funeral in October 2019.

From 1976 to 1982, Leonov was the commander of the cosmonaut team (&quot;Chief Cosmonaut&quot;) and deputy director of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, where he oversaw crew training. He also edited the cosmonaut newsletter &quot;Neptune&quot;. He retired in 1992.

== Later life and death ==
Leonov was an accomplished artist whose published books include albums of his artistic works and works he did in collaboration with his friend Andrei Sokolov. Leonov took coloured pencils and paper into space, where he sketched the Earth, becoming the first artist in space, and drew portraits of the Apollo astronauts who flew with him during the 1975 Apollo–Soyuz Test Project.

Arthur C. Clarke wrote in his notes to his 1982 novel &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; that, after a 1968 screening of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Leonov pointed out to him that the alignment of the Moon, Earth, and Sun shown in the opening is essentially the same as that in Leonov&#x27;s 1967 painting &quot;Near the Moon&quot;, although the painting&#x27;s diagonal framing of the scene was not replicated in the film. Clarke kept an autographed sketch of this painting—which Leonov made after the screening—hanging on his office wall. Clarke dedicated &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; to Leonov and Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov. The fictional spaceship in the book is named &quot;Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov&quot;.

Together with Valentin Selivanov, Leonov wrote the script for the 1980 science fiction film &quot;The Orion Loop&quot;.
Leonov was the head of the Banner of Peace in Space project from 1990 until his death.

Leonov retired in 1991 and lived in Moscow. He had been in reserve since March 1992. In 1992–1993, he was director of space programs at Chetek. Leonov was an advisor to the First Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Moscow-based Alfa-Bank, and in 2001, vice-president of Alfa-Bank. He was a member of the United Russia party since 18 December 2002 and a member of the party&#x27;s Supreme Council. He received recognition as an artist (he collaborated with Andrei Sokolov), and his works are widely exhibited and published.

In 2004, Leonov and former American astronaut David Scott began work on a dual memoir covering the history of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Titled &quot;Two Sides of the Moon: Our Story of the Cold War Space Race&quot;, it was published in 2006. Neil Armstrong and Tom Hanks both wrote introductions to the book.

Leonov was interviewed by Francis French for the 2007 book &quot;Into That Silent Sea&quot; by Colin Burgess and French.

Leonov died in Moscow on 11 October 2019 after a long illness. His funeral took place on 15 October. He was 85 and the last living member of the five cosmonauts in the Voskhod programme. He was survived by his wife Svetlana Dozenko, daughter Oksana, and two grandchildren; his other daughter, Viktoria, died in 1996.

== Legacy ==
* Worried about the Siberian wildlife, namely bears and wolves, while awaiting pick-up after landing, Alexei Leonov inspired the TP-82 Cosmonaut survival pistol, which was regularly carried by Cosmonaut expeditions from 1986 to 2007.
* The Leonov crater, near Mare Moscoviense (&quot;Sea of Moscow&quot;) on the far side of the Moon, was named after Leonov in 1970.
*9533 Aleksejleonov, an asteroid first observed in 1981, was named for him.
* In the 1982 book &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke the Soviet spaceship &quot;Alexei Leonov&quot; is named after the cosmonaut. The book is dedicated to Leonov and Andrei Sakharov.
* Leonov, along with Rusty Schweickart, established the Association of Space Explorers in 1985. Membership is open to all people who have orbited the Earth.
* Leonov created the image of Stephen Hawking for the medal, which was established by the Starmus Festival. Since 2015, it has been awarded for works contributing to the promotion of scientific knowledge in various fields, such as music, art, cinema. The portrait of Hawking painted by the astronaut is depicted on the front side of the &quot;scientific Oscar&quot;. The reverse depicts Leonov&#x27;s first spacewalk and Brian May&#x27;s guitar, symbolizing the two main components of the festival. Leonov created the design for the reverse side in close cooperation with May.
* The 2017 film &quot;The Age of Pioneers&quot; () is based on Leonov&#x27;s account of the Voskhod 2 mission. Leonov was portrayed by Yevgeny Mironov. He was a technical adviser for the movie; the director cut all scenes featuring Gagarin–about 40 minutes of film–so Leonov could be the focus.
* The song &quot;E.V.A.&quot; by Public Service Broadcasting on their 2015 album, &quot;The Race for Space&quot;, references Leonov becoming the first man to undertake extravehicular activity in space.
* In the 2019 alternate history television series, &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, Leonov is portrayed as the first person to walk on the Moon.
* &quot;Leonov&quot;, a 2020 album by BlackWeald, is a dark ambient interpretation of the Voskhod 2 mission.
* &quot;Orbital Sunrise,&quot; an essay by John Green, focuses in part on the sketch Leonov made during his 1965 mission. It was released on 26 August 2021 as part of Green&#x27;s podcast, &quot;The Anthropocene Reviewed.&quot; Later, it was posted separately on the YouTube channel vlogbrothers, and included in the &quot;Anthropocene Reviewed&quot; book. 
* At the 2022 on Starmus festival, held for the first time in the post-Soviet space, in Armenia, the premiere of the documentary film &quot;Space Inside&quot; about Alexei Leonov took place. It was introduced by the cosmonaut&#x27;s daughter, Oksana Leonova. It is based on the last interview of the pioneer.

<doc id="195648" wikidata="Q3966821" url="?curid=195648" title="Spirit of the Boogie">
<text>Spirit of the Boogie is the sixth studio album by Kool &amp; the Gang, released in 1975. It can be seen as a follow-up to &quot;Wild and Peaceful&quot; (1973); the instrumental &quot;Jungle Jazz&quot; uses the same basic rhythm track heard in &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot;, but lets the players improvise on their instruments (saxophone, trumpet and flute). References to earlier works can be noticed (&quot;Ancestral Ceremony&quot; contains the line: &quot;making merry music...&quot;, which was the name of a song from their 1972 album, &quot;Good Times&quot;). &quot;Spirit of the Boogie&quot; features Donald Boyce, who was rapping on &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot;. Some African influence can be felt, and the band even play in a West-Indian style on &quot;Caribbean Festival&quot;, another instrumental track, with once more much room for improvisation.

The LP cover mistakenly lists &quot;Cosmic Energy&quot; as track 4 instead of &quot;Sunshine and Love&quot;. &quot;Cosmic Energy&quot; was actually released on the next album, &quot;Love &amp; Understanding&quot;.

In one of the songs in the album, entitled &quot;Jungle Jazz&quot;, the repetitive drum beat that is heard after the drum fill at the beginning has been sampled in over 50 songs, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Away&quot; by Jade and &quot;Pump Up The Volume&quot; by M/A/R/R/S; it can also be found as a sample in FL Studio&#x27;s files.

<text>Google Answers was an online knowledge market offered by Google, active from April 2002 until December 2006.

== History ==
Google Answers&#x27; predecessor was Google Questions and Answers, which was launched in June 2001. This service involved Google staffers answering questions by e-mail for a flat fee (US$3.00). It was fully functional for about 24 hours, after which it was shut down, possibly due to excessive demand and the tough competition that Yahoo! set in place.

Google Answers was launched in April 2002. A month later, a search feature was added.

Google Answers came out of beta in May 2003. It received more than 100 question postings per day when the service ended in December 2006. According to Danny Sullivan of Searchenginewatch, Google Answers was not solid enough to compete against Yahoo! Answers.

In late November 2006, Google reported that it planned to permanently shut down the service (except for the Hong Kong and Arabic versions). No new questions were accepted after November 30, 2006, and no new answers were accepted after December 31, 2006. It was fully closed by late December 2006, although its archives remain available.

Google opened related sites, one in Russia also called Google Questions and Answers in 2007, and one in China called Tianya Answers, in reference to its Chinese partner site. In September 2009, Google launched an Arabic version called Google Egabat or Google Ejabat (إجابات Google), meaning &quot;Google Answers&quot;. However, in late May 2014, this service was announced to be read-only starting from 23 June 2014.

In an email sent to registered researchers announcing the closure, Google wrote:

We considered many factors in reaching this difficult decision, and ultimately decided that the Answers community&#x27;s limited size and other product considerations made it more effective for us to focus our efforts on other ways to help our users find information.

== Description ==
=== Process ===
Google Answers was designed as an extension to the conventional search: rather than doing the search themselves, users would pay someone else to do the search. Anyone could ask questions, offer a price for an answer, and researchers, who were called Google Answers Researchers or GARs, answered them. Researchers were not Google employees, but contractors that were required to complete an application process to be approved to answer for the site. They were limited in number (according to Google, there were more than 500 Researchers; in practice, there were fewer active Researchers). The application process tested their research and communication abilities.

Researchers with low ratings could be fired, a policy which encouraged eloquence and accuracy. Also, Google stated that people who commented might be selected to become Researchers, therefore inspiring high-quality comments. For a Researcher, a question was answered by logging into a special researchers page and then &quot;locking&quot; a question they wanted to answer. This act of &quot;locking&quot; claimed the question for that researcher. Questions worth less than $100 could be locked for up to four hours, and questions worth more than $100 could be locked up to eight hours at a time in order to be properly answered. A Researcher could only lock one question at a time.

Asker-accepted answers cost $2 to $200. Google retained 25% of the researcher&#x27;s reward and a 50-cent fee per question. In addition to the researcher&#x27;s fees, a client who was satisfied with the answer could also leave a tip of up to $100.

In Google Search, when a user would put &quot;why?&quot; at the end of a search query, Google would show a link to Google Answers where the answer could be provided for a fee.

=== Question structure ===

* The client&#x27;s question, to which the Researcher could respond with a request for clarification if any part of a question was unclear.
* The answer remained empty if the question had not yet been answered and only a Researcher could post an answer. Any Researcher could answer any question, although askers could specifically request a certain Researcher in the title or body of their question. After the answer was posted, the client could communicate with the Researcher to ask for clarification of the answer; the client could also rate the answer on a one- to five-star system and tip the Researcher for a job well done.
* The comment section provided an area where any registered user, Researchers and non-Researchers alike, could comment on the question. Some questions were &quot;answered&quot; in comments before a Researcher could answer. Naturally, this section, too, could be left empty, if no comments had been posted.

The pages of Google Answers&#x27; website ranked extremely well in Google&#x27;s search results, and so the commenting system was widely exploited by the SEO community.

=== Rules ===
Google&#x27;s policies prohibited answering questions that would obviously lead to or contain:

* Copyright infringement and privacy violations.
* Plagiarism in homework assignments.
* Discussion of Google Answers itself, or about Google policies and mechanisms (PageRank, for example).
* Links to adult oriented sites.
* Promotion of illegal activities.

== Criticism ==
Some librarians have criticized Google Answers as a service selling services that are part of the tasks of public librarians (in the United States). The most vocal of these critics was former Google Answers Researcher Jessamyn West, whose contract was terminated after she violated the site&#x27;s terms of service by publishing an article about her experience as a Google Answers Researcher. Other reference librarians claimed that the service was not detrimental to libraries, but simply operated in parallel to them.

Other critics claimed that the service encourages plagiarism. The official Google Answers policy was to remove questions that appeared to be school assignments. However, some journalists expressed concerns that sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between a &quot;legitimate&quot; question and a homework assignment, especially in regard to sciences and programming.

<doc id="195652" wikidata="Q1424289" url="?curid=195652" title="SS Yongala">
<text>SS &quot;Yongala&quot; was a passenger steamship that was built in England in 1903 for the Adelaide Steamship Company. She sank in a cyclone off the coast of Queensland in 1911, with the loss of all 122 passengers and crew aboard.

Her wreck off Cape Bowling Green was found in 1958. It is now a popular wreck diving site, protected by the Commonwealth Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018.

&quot;Yongala&quot; was the sister ship of , which in 1914 became Australia&#x27;s only hospital ship in the First World War.

==Building and identification==
In 1903 Sir WG Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co built a pair of passenger and cargo steamships at its Low Walker shipyard at Newcastle upon Tyne for the Adelaide Steamship Co. &quot;Yongala&quot; was built as yard number 736, launched on 29 April 1903, and completed that October. She was named after the town of Yongala, South Australia. The name is a Ngadjuri word that means &quot;broad water&quot;, or &quot;broad wide watering place&quot;. Her sister ship &quot;Grantala&quot; was yard number 737, launched on 28 May 1903, and completed that December.

&quot;Yongala&quot;″s registered length was , her beam was and her depth was . Her tonnages were and . She had a single screw, driven by a three-cylinder triple expansion engine built by the Wallsend Slipway Company. She had five single-ended boilers, which supplied steam to her engine at 180 lbf/in2 (1,200 kPa). Her furnaces burned about 67 tonnes of coal per day. Her engine was rated at 690 NHP and gave her a speed of .

&quot;Yongala&quot; had accommodation for 110 first class and 130 second class passengers, and holds for about 3,000 tons of cargo. She had electric lighting throughout. She had a direct acting steam windlass and capstan on her forecastle head. To handle her cargo she had two steam cranes and seven winches with derricks. A specially arranged steam and hand steering gear was fitted in a house at the after end of the fantail and controlled from the bridge. She had of refrigerated space: chilled for vegetables and provisions, and for frozen meat.

The Adelaide Steamship Co registered &quot;Yongala&quot; at Port Adelaide. Her UK official number was 118332 and her code letters were VGFH.

==Service history==

&quot;Yongala&quot; began her delivery voyage from Southampton in England on 9 October 1903. She sustained some damage in heavy weather crossing the Bay of Biscay, called at Las Palmas and Cape Town, and on 24 November reached Fremantle. When she continued her voyage from Fremantle to Adelaide, it was alleged that she raced the Orient Steam Navigation Company mail ship , and that &quot;Yongala&quot; won the race. The Adelaide Steamship Company publicly denied that any race took place. On 30 November she reached Port Adelaide, where Adelaide Steamship Co shareholders inspected her. She reached Melbourne on 3 December and Grafton Wharf in Sydney on 6 December.

In 1905 &quot;Yongala&quot;″s regular route linked Fremantle and Sydney via Adelaide and Melbourne. In 1906 her summer route was extended to Brisbane. At this was Australia&#x27;s longest interstate shipping route, and &quot;Yongala&quot; was the first ship to work it. Each winter from 1907 to 1911 she worked the route between Melbourne and Cairns instead.

==Loss==

On 14 March 1911 &quot;Yongala&quot; began her 99th voyage in Australian waters. Her Master was Captain William Knight. She left Melbourne with 72 passengers, and on 20 March reached Brisbane. There most of her passengers from Melbourne disembarked, and she embarked passengers to continue up the Queensland coast. Also embarked were the racehorse &quot;Moonshine&quot; and a Lincoln Red bull. A harbour inspection reported &quot;Yongala&quot; to be &quot;in excellent trim&quot;.

She reached Mackay on the morning of 23 March, and left at 1:40pm that afternoon, bound for Townsville. She was now carrying 29 first class passengers, 19 second class passengers, 72 crew, and 677 tons of cargo. Shortly after she left Mackay, and before she left the sight of land, the Flat Top Island signal station received a telegram warning of a tropical cyclone between Townsville and Mackay. The signal station sent flag and wireless telegraph signals, which prompted several ships to take refuge at Mackay. But &quot;Yongala&quot; did not see the flags. The Marconi Company had recently dispatched a wireless telegraph set from England to be installed aboard &quot;Yongala&quot;, but the set had not yet reached Australia.

Five hours after &quot;Yongala&quot; left Mackay, the keeper of Dent Island Light saw her enter Whitsunday Passage. This was the last known sighting of her. The cyclone sank her on the night of 23–24 March, killing everyone aboard. Newspapers at the time counted 120 or 121 people aboard, but the total number is now accepted to be at least 122. The discrepancy arises from young children, servants, and members of ethnic minorities being omitted from official lists.

==Aftermath==

When &quot;Yongala&quot; did not reach Townsville on time, at first it was assumed that, like other ships, she had taken shelter from the cyclone. But on 26 March she was listed as &quot;missing&quot;. The Premier of Queensland, Digby Denham, ordered a search for her, in which seven vessels took part. Wreckage started to wash ashore on the Queensland coast between Hinchinbrook Island and Bowen. The body of the racehorse &quot;Moonshine&quot; was found at Gordon Creek, but no trace was found of any of the passengers or crew. The Queensland Government offered a £1,000 reward for information enabling the ship to be found. The reward went unclaimed, so it was eventually withdrawn.

It was speculated that either the cyclone had overwhelmed &quot;Yongala&quot;, or she may have grounded on a reef between Flinders Passage and Keeper Reef, or on Nares Rock, or on Cape Upstart.

Within days of the ship&#x27;s loss, &quot;&quot;Yongala&quot; distress fund&quot; was set up. Money raised was used to relieve the dependants of those aboard. The fund was closed on 30 September 1914, with the £900 remaining credited to the Queensland Shipwreck Society.

Between 8 and 20 June 1911 the Marine Board of Queensland held an inquiry into &quot;Yongala&quot;″s loss. The Board considered the ship&#x27;s stability, equipment and seaworthiness, and Captain Knight&#x27;s abilities as a shipmaster. It found no fault with the condition of the ship, based on design specifications supplied by the Adelaide Steamship Co, along with data from sea trials and seven years of uneventful operation. Nor did it find fault with Knight&#x27;s ability. He was one of Adelaide Steamship Co&#x27;s most capable men, and had 14 years&#x27; service without incident. The Board declared that it had &quot;no desire to indulge in idle speculation&quot;, and concluded that &quot;the fate of the Yongala passes beyond human ken into the realms of conjecture, to add one more to the long roll of mysteries of the sea&quot;.

==Discovery==
In 1943, a minesweeper fouled on what was then thought to be a shoal, 11 miles east of Cape Bowling Green. The commander marked on his chart an obstruction at a depth of about , on the route of vessels bound for Townsville.
In June 1947, the survey vessel investigated the location using echo sounding and anti-submarine equipment. She found a shoal about long, at a depth of about , surrounded by water deep, and concluded that it could be the wreck of a steamship.

In 1958 a local fisherman, Bill Kirkpatrick, found the wreck, and recovered artefacts including a safe from one of the cabins. The safe contained only black sludge, but part of the safe&#x27;s serial number was legible: 9825W. In 1961, Chubb in England identified this as the number of the safe that it supplied to Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co. in 1903 for the cabin of &quot;Yongala&quot;″s purser.

==Wreck site==

&quot;Yongala&quot;″s wreck is at position , in the central section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, about southeast of Townsville and east of Cape Bowling Green. The wreck is long. The bow points on a northerly bearing of 347 degrees, and lists to starboard at an angle of between 60 and 70 degrees. It retains its structural integrity. The depth of water to the sea floor is about , with the upper parts of the wreck below the surface.

The sea floor around the wreck is open and sandy, so the wreck has become an established artificial reef, providing a structurally complex habitat for diverse marine life. In 1981 the marine biologist Leon Zann sketched the wreck. Its superstructure remains intact and much as in his sketch, but a significant buildup of sand around the starboard side of the vessel has been scoured away, and the ventilators and railings have collapsed.

The wreck is protected by the Commonwealth Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018 and is managed via the Museum of Tropical Queensland, Townsville. The Act prohibits penetration diving and interference with artefacts.
A protected zone encompasses both the wreck, all the seabed within a radius of from the wreck, and the waters above. Access to the site is via permit only, obtainable from the Maritime Archaeology Section of the Museum of Tropical Queensland. In 2002, to prevent further damage by careless anchoring, several moorings were installed, and anchoring within the protected zone was forbidden. The site was also listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

==Present day==
&quot;Yongala&quot; is now a major tourist attraction for recreational diving in Townsville and North Queensland, with more than 10,000 divers visiting the wreck each year. At long, she is one of the largest, most intact historic shipwrecks. The site has diverse marine life. A citizen science database using iNaturalist has recorded more than 213 observations of 79 species. The most observed species is the Humphead wrasse, &quot;Cheilinus undulatus&quot;. An episode of the BBC television documentary series &quot;Great Barrier Reef&quot; featured the wreck&#x27;s biodiversity.
The Maritime Museum of Townsville has an extensive display of &quot;Yongala&quot; artefacts and memorabilia, including her ship&#x27;s bell.

The death of Tina Watson occurred near the dive site on 22 October 2003. Watson&#x27;s husband of eleven days was subsequently imprisoned for manslaughter.

The heritage-listed Yongala Lodge in North Ward, Townsville, is named after the ship. It was built for Matthew Rooney, who died in the &quot;Yongala&quot; shipwreck along with his wife and youngest daughter.
