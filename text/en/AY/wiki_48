<text>The ide (&quot;Leuciscus idus&quot;), or orfe, is a freshwater fish of the family Cyprinidae found in larger rivers, ponds, and lakes across Northern Europe and Asia. It has been introduced outside its native range into Europe, North America, and New Zealand. It is a popular ornamental fish, usually kept in outdoor ponds in temperate regions from which it often escapes.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;ide&quot; is from Swedish &quot;id&quot;, originally referring to its bright colour (compare the German dialect word &quot;Aitel&quot;, a kind of bright fish and Old High German &quot;Eit&quot;, funeral pyre, fire). The alternative name &quot;orfe&quot; derives from German &quot;Orf&quot;, through the Latin &quot;orphus&quot; meaning a &quot;sea fish&quot; or &quot;sea perch&quot;, which in turn derives from the Greek &quot;orphōs&quot;. The generic name &quot;Leuciscus&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;leykiskos&quot;, which means &quot;white mullet&quot;.

==Subspecies==
The two recognised subspecies of the ide are:

*&quot;L. i. idus&quot; the nominate subspecies
*&quot;L. i. oxianus&quot; from central Asia

==Description==
The ide is a rather plump, sturdily built fish with a deep body, although not especially so. The peduncle of the caudal fin is thick. When they are small, ide have dark backs and silvery sides, but older fish develop a golden sheen along the flanks. At all ages, the eye is yellow and the pectoral fin and anal fin are reddish in colour. 
The dorsal fin has three spines and 8–11 soft rays, the anal fin has three spines and 8–11 soft rays, while the caudal fin has 19 rays. It has 47 vertebrae. It is distinguished from other European members of the genus &quot;Leucsicus&quot; by the lateral line having 56–58 scales; 3.5–5.3 pharyngeal teeth, in having a terminal mouth, and branching in 8% of the dorsal rays and 10% of the anal rays. They grow to 25–50 cm in length and the normal weight range is 0.5–1.5 kg and they seldom attain weights over 2.0 kg. The European rod-caught record is 5.5 kg. Reports have been made of ides attaining total lengths around 100 cm and weights of 8 kg.

==Distribution==
The ide is native to Europe and western Asia from the rivers draining into the North Sea east through southern Scandinavia and eastern Europe to the Caspian Sea drainage and the River Lena. As a popular ornamental fish, it was introduced to Great Britain in 1874 and is now widespread in England and Wales, but only has a localised distribution in Scotland. It was introduced into France and from there and Germany was introduced as an ornamental fish into the Netherlands.

Outside of Europe, the ide was first taken to the United States of America in 1877, when live specimens were imported by the United States Fish Commission to be intentionally stocked in US waters, and this was subsequently done by state agencies, too; the species also spread through escapes from commercial and government ponds. It has now been reported from nine states, but its status in the United States remains uncertain as many records are old and of a few individuals and the species apparently has either failed to establish self-sustaining populations or has been eradicated.

The ide was illegally imported into New Zealand as eggs, sometime in the 1980s. Fish were subsequently released between 1985 and 1986 in no less than eight and possibly as many as 13 sites north of Auckland. Ide probably did not last very long in at least seven of the sites where releases occurred, the outcome in most of the other sites is unknown, and at least one of the release sites remains unknown. Ide likely persist in the wild in at least one site within New Zealand.

==Habitat and ecology==
Ide occur in schools in the clear pools of larger rivers, ponds, and lakes, but they may move to deeper waters during the winter before moving into shallow fresh water to spawn in the spring. The species is also found in the Baltic Sea, which has a lower salinity than most seas, and in Sweden, the fish spend the first year of their lives in rivers before joining the more mature fish as they migrate downstream into the Baltic Sea during the summer. The fish then return to the rivers in the autumn, where they remain close to the mouths and in the lower reaches throughout the winter.

The ide reaches sexual maturity at 3–5 years of age, and once it has attained total length, which varies from 22 cm to 43 cm, although in cooler waters, it may first breed as late as 7 years of age. It spawns in shallow water in the spring, soon after the ice has melted in the colder parts of its range. Some populations are migratory and ascend rivers and streams to spawn, but others also spawn in shallow parts of lakes and sea inlets. Eggs are usually laid among gravel or on emergent vegetation. Spawning normally lasts for 3–4 days, during which the fish are very active. Each female spawns only once a season, but during spawning, she mates with several males and the males gather at spawning grounds, where they follow ripe females. The females may lay as few as 15,000 and as many as 250,000 eggs, which are about 2 mm in diameter and pale yellow in colour, in a season. The eggs hatch in 1–2 weeks, the young fry being 8–10 mm long. The actual incubation period of eggs varies depending on the water temperature, at 18.5–22.0 °C, incubation takes about 5 days, with the optimal temperature for embryonic development being in the range of 12–18 °C.

The typical prey of the ide is larval and adult insects, snails, and other benthic invertebrates for smaller fish, but larger individuals can be piscivorous, with common roach and common bleak being commonly taken. The smaller fish, larvae, and juveniles occupy a wide variety of shoreline habitats to feed, and they leave the shore areas and move into deeper waters as they grow larger. Smaller ide are sociable and join mixed shoals of other cyprinids, but the larger adult fish form smaller, single-species groups, which patrol what are believed to be regular routes. The ide prefers clear, warmer water, and is not as tolerant of eutrophication as some related species. Ide spawn in running water, so the obstruction of rivers by dams and other man-made objects can negatively affect this fish.

==Human uses==
As an ornamental fish, the ide is usually referred to as the orfe, and the main variety kept is the golden orfe, which is golden or orange in colour with some black spots on its neck, near the head. Also, a much less common blue variety is known as the blue orfe. As they grow quite large, they are not considered to be suitable for indoor aquaria, and they recommended to be kept outside as a shoal in a pond. They require better-oxygenated water than koi or goldfish, but can be kept in association with these species. Golden orfe were very popular as an ornamental pond fish until koi became readily available in the 1960s.

In their native range, they are popular as a quarry for anglers; in eastern Europe, the ide is regarded as edible and is prized as a food fish, and are netted and sold commercially along the Danube. In more northern parts of the range, though, they are not regarded as a desirable food fish. They are also fished for as coarse fish in the United Kingdom, but there they tend to be localised to commercial fisheries or to sites where they have been introduced.

<doc id="192221" wikidata="Q1500304" url="?curid=192221" title="HMS Canopus (1897)">
<text>HMS &quot;Canopus&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the British Royal Navy and the lead ship of the . Intended for service in Asia, &quot;Canopus&quot; and her sister ships were smaller and faster than the preceding s, but retained the same battery of four guns. She also carried thinner armour, but incorporated new Krupp steel, which was more effective than the Harvey armour used in the &quot;Majestic&quot;s. &quot;Canopus&quot; was laid down in January 1897, launched in October that year, and commissioned into the fleet in December 1899.

&quot;Canopus&quot; served in the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning until 1903, when she was decommissioned for refitting. In 1905, she was sent to East Asia, but the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance that year rendered her presence in Asian waters unnecessary. She instead returned to Britain and served with several fleet commands in British waters, including the Atlantic Fleet, the Channel Fleet, and finally the Home Fleet. Another short deployment to the Mediterranean followed in 1908–1909. Upon returning to Britain, she was placed in reserve.

At the beginning of the First World War in August 1914, she was mobilised for service in the South America Station, where she patrolled for German commerce raiders. She was involved in the search for the German East Asia Squadron of Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee. Too slow to follow Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock&#x27;s cruisers, she missed the Battle of Coronel in November 1914, where Cradock was defeated. Moored at Port Stanley as a defensive battery, she fired the first shots of the Battle of the Falklands in December, which led Spee to break off the attack before being chased down and destroyed by Admiral Doveton Sturdee&#x27;s battlecruisers.

&quot;Canopus&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean in early 1915 for the Dardanelles Campaign. She participated in major attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in March 1915, but the British and French fleets proved incapable of forcing the straits. After the Gallipoli Campaign ended with the withdrawal of Allied forces in January 1916, &quot;Canopus&quot; patrolled the eastern Mediterranean, but saw no further action. She was removed from service in April 1916 and was converted into a barracks ship in early 1918. After the war, the ship was broken up in 1920.

==Design==


&quot;Canopus&quot; and her five sister ships were designed for service in East Asia, where the new rising power Japan was beginning to build a powerful navy, though this role was quickly made redundant by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902. The ships were designed to be smaller, lighter and faster than their predecessors, the s. &quot;Canopus&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 682 officers and ratings.

The &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the &quot;Majestic&quot;s.

&quot;Canopus&quot; had a main battery of four 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although at a fixed elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull, two on each broadside near the forward and aft barbette.

To save weight, &quot;Canopus&quot; carried less armour than the &quot;Majestic&quot;s— in the belt compared to —although the change from Harvey armour in the &quot;Majestic&quot;s to Krupp armour in &quot;Canopus&quot; meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been, Krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Similarly, the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. The main battery turrets were 10 in thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12 in thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

==Service history==
&quot;Canopus&quot;″s keel was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 4 January 1897. The ship was launched on 12 October 1897, and completed on 5 December 1899. She was named after the ancient city of Canopus, Egypt, where the Battle of the Nile took place. &quot;Canopus&quot; was commissioned by captain Wilmot Fawkes at Portsmouth on 5 December 1899 for service in the Mediterranean Fleet. Captain Harry Seawell Niblett was appointed in command in November 1900, and she underwent a refit at Malta from December 1900 to June 1901. In May 1902 she visited Palermo to attend festivities in connection with the opening of an Agricultural Exhibition by King Victor Emmanuel, and the following month saw her visiting Larnaka. Captain Philip Francis Tillard was appointed in command on 1 December 1902, and in January 1903 she carried the British Secretary of State for War, St John Brodrick, during a visit to Malta and Gibraltar. She ended her Mediterranean service in April that year, and paid off into the Reserve at Portsmouth on 25 April 1903. While in reserve, &quot;Canopus&quot; was given an extensive refit by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead that lasted from May 1903 to June 1904. Returning to the commissioned Reserve at Portsmouth, she was rammed by the battleship in Mount&#x27;s Bay during manoeuvres on 5 August 1904, suffering slight damage.

&quot;Canopus&quot; returned to full commission on 9 May 1905 and relieved the battleship on the China Station. She had reached Colombo, Ceylon on her outbound voyage when the United Kingdom and Japan ratified a treaty of alliance. The alliance meant that the United Kingdom could have a reduced presence on the China Station and battleships were no longer required there, so &quot;Canopus&quot; was recalled from Colombo in June 1905 and thus was the only &quot;Canopus&quot;-class battleship which did not serve on the China Station. Upon her return to the United Kingdom, &quot;Canopus&quot; began service in the Atlantic Fleet on 22 July 1905. In January 1906 she transferred to the Channel Fleet and later that year was fitted with fire control. On 10 March 1907, she transferred to the Portsmouth Division of the Home Fleet at Portsmouth, where she was reduced to a nucleus crew in May 1907 and underwent a refit between November 1907 and April 1908. Her refit completed, &quot;Canopus&quot; commissioned on 28 April 1908 for service in the Mediterranean Fleet. In December 1909, she was reduced to service in the 4th Division, Home Fleet, undergoing a refit at Chatham Dockyard from July 1911 to April 1912 during this service. In May 1912 she went into reserve at the Nore to serve as the parent ship for the 4th Division, Home Fleet. In 1913 and 1914 she was stationed at Pembroke Dock in Wales as part of the 3rd Fleet. The ships of the 3rd Fleet, though on the active list, were effectively in reserve, as they had small caretaker crews that would be completed only in the event of war.

===First World War===

After the First World War broke out in August 1914, &quot;Canopus&quot; was commissioned on 7 August 1914, for service in the 8th Battle Squadron in the Channel Fleet, under the command of Captain Heathcoat Grant. She was detached from that duty on 21 August 1914 to operate from the Cape Verde-Canary Islands Station to support the cruiser squadron there. In early September, her sister ship relieved her and &quot;Canopus&quot; transferred to the South America Station to become guard ship there and provide support to the cruiser squadron of Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock. While en route, &quot;Canopus&quot; nearly encountered the German light cruiser off Brazil, but the German ship intercepted British radio signals before &quot;Canopus&quot; could locate her.

====South Seas Station====

&quot;Canopus&quot; departed the Abrolhos Rocks on 8 October 1914 to assist Cradock&#x27;s ships in searching for the German East Asia Squadron of Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, which was en route to the South Atlantic from the Far East. &quot;Canopus&quot; arrived at Stanley in the Falkland Islands on 18 October 1914, where she took up guard ship and escort duties. Cradock had initially intended to take &quot;Canopus&quot; with his squadron, which consisted of the armoured cruisers and , the light cruiser &quot;Glasgow&quot; and the auxiliary cruiser , but her late arrival, coupled with the fact that she required an overhaul upon arriving in the Falklands, forced Cradock to proceed without her. In addition, &quot;Canopus&quot; could make no more than , which would have made it difficult for Cradock to force the East Asia Squadron into battle. Cradock ordered &quot;Canopus&quot; to join him when possible, though he intended to use her only to protect his colliers. On 27 October, Cradock detached his light cruiser to Coronel to gather intelligence, and the next day ordered &quot;Canopus&quot; to bring the colliers to the Juan Fernández Islands, where his squadron would replenish its fuel. &quot;Glasgow&quot; arrived in Coronel on 31 October, but departed too early on 1 November to receive an order from the First Sea Lord that Cradock should not risk engaging Spee&#x27;s squadron without &quot;Canopus&quot;.

&quot;Canopus&quot; was still some south of Cradock when he encountered Spee&#x27;s squadron, and the German ships were faster than the British cruisers, preventing Cradock from rejoining &quot;Canopus&quot;. In the ensuing Battle of Coronel, the East Asia Squadron sank both of Cradock&#x27;s armoured cruisers and damaged &quot;Glasgow&quot;; by the time Cradock was defeated, &quot;Canopus&quot; was still away. &quot;Glasgow&quot; and &quot;Otranto&quot; escaped to the south and rendezvoused with &quot;Canopus&quot;. Spee broke off the pursuit of the fleeing British ships when he became aware that &quot;Canopus&quot; was in the area, writing the following day that, &quot;against this ship, we can hardly do anything. If they had kept their forces together we should most likely have come off second best.&quot; Shortly after news of the battle reached Britain, the Royal Navy ordered all naval forces in the region to consolidate; this included the remnants of Cradock&#x27;s command, along with the armoured cruisers , , and . In addition, a pair of battlecruisers— and —were detached from the Grand Fleet to hunt down and destroy Spee&#x27;s squadron.
&quot;Canopus&quot; and &quot;Glasgow&quot; returned to Stanley, arriving there on 8 November 1914; they immediately proceeded to join the British warships concentrating off the River Plate. &quot;Canopus&quot; was ordered to return to the Falklands and place herself in Stanley to guard the port on 9 November. She arrived three days later, and began to make preparations for the defence of the harbour. At Stanley, &quot;Canopus&quot;″s crew set up defences against an attack by Graf Spee. &quot;Canopus&quot; herself was beached in the mudflats in a position that allowed her to cover the entrance to the harbour and have a field of fire landward to the southeast; to reduce her visibility, her topmasts were struck and she was camouflaged. An observation post was established ashore on high ground and connected to the ship by telephone, allowing &quot;Canopus&quot; to use indirect fire against approaching ships. Some of her 12-pounder guns and a detachment of seventy Royal Marines were put ashore to defend Stanley and its environs. On 25 November, &quot;Canopus&quot; intercepted a radio message that indicated that Spee&#x27;s squadron had rounded Cape Horn, though the message was erroneous; Spee actually made the passage on the night of 1–2 December. By 4 December, &quot;Canopus&quot;″s crew had completed their preparations.

On 7 December, the main British squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee, arrived in Stanley and began coaling, with the intention of departing two days later to search for Spee. Instead, on the morning of 8 December, the German squadron arrived off Stanley; at 07:50, lookouts aboard &quot;Canopus&quot; raised the alarm. Shortly after 09:00, by which time the German cruisers— and —had approached to within , &quot;Canopus&quot; fired two salvos, both of which fell short. Observers stated that fragments from the second salvo hit one of &quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s funnels, though according to modern historians, including Robert Gardiner and Randal Gray, Hew Strachan, and Paul Halpern, &quot;Canopus&quot; made no hits with either salvo. Under fire from &quot;Canopus&quot; and spotting the tripod masts of Sturdee&#x27;s battlecruisers, Spee called off his force&#x27;s planned attack on the Falklands. At 09:31, &quot;Canopus&quot; ceased firing, as the Germans had begun to withdraw. Sturdee&#x27;s battlecruisers, much faster than Spee&#x27;s ships, eventually caught and destroyed the East Asia Squadron, with the exception of the light cruiser , which was able to outrun the British pursuers. &quot;Canopus&quot;, still moored in the mud, remained behind at Stanley and missed the rest of the battle. &quot;Canopus&quot; left the Falklands on 18 December 1914 to return to her South American Station duties at the Abrolhos Rocks.

====Dardanelles campaign====
In February 1915, &quot;Canopus&quot; transferred to the Mediterranean to take part in the Dardanelles campaign. On 2 March 1915, she took part in the second attack on the Ottoman Turkish entrance forts at the Dardanelles. During this operation, she led the 4th Sub-Division, which also included the pre-dreadnoughts and . &quot;Canopus&quot; and &quot;Swiftsure&quot; were tasked with suppressing the guns in the fortress at Dardanus while &quot;Cornwallis&quot; would engage minor batteries at Intepe and Erenköy. &quot;Canopus&quot; and &quot;Swiftsure&quot; entered the straits at 13:20 and closed to within of the north shore, where at 14:20 they opened fire at the fortress on the other side of the straits, some away. The ships fired for about two hours before the Ottomans inside Dardanus returned fire at 16:15, which they did quite accurately, straddling &quot;Canopus&quot; quickly and scoring a hit on her quarterdeck that damaged a wardroom. A second shell knocked down her topmast and a third holed her after funnel, exploded, and rained fragments on two of her boats.

The heavy Ottoman fire forced &quot;Canopus&quot; and &quot;Swiftsure&quot; to withdraw from their bombardment position, though this placed them in range of the guns at Erenköy as well, while those at Dardanus could still engage them. &quot;Cornwallis&quot;, having silenced the guns at Intepe, started shelling Erenköy, while &quot;Canopus&quot; and &quot;Swiftsure&quot; kept their fire on Dardanus. The Ottomans repeatedly straddled the three battleships, but being further out in the strait, they had more room to manoeuvre and so avoided any direct hits. By 16:40, the guns at Dardanus fell silent, allowing all three ships to concentrate their fire at Erenköy, where the batteries were quickly neutralised. The three ships then withdrew, seemingly having achieved their objective, though that night, when destroyers and minesweepers tried to clear the minefields blocking the straits, they were met with very heavy fire and were forced to withdraw. During the third landings on 4 March 1915, she demonstrated off the Aegean coast to keep Ottoman ground forces tied down.

She covered the bombardment of the forts by the superdreadnought on 8 March, and covered minesweepers attempting to sweep in minefields off Kephes on 10 March. During the operation on the 10th, she, the protected cruiser , and several destroyers covered a force of minesweepers. &quot;Canopus&quot; attempted to destroy the searchlights for the Ottoman coastal guns but failed to knock them out. As a result, when the minesweepers tried to clear the mines, they came under intense fire and had to retreat, one of them striking a mine in the chaos. She also took part in the major attack on the Narrows forts on 18 March 1915. During the 18 March attack, a fleet of British and French warships—including &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and the battlecruiser &quot;Inflexible&quot;—would attempt to suppress the forts in daylight, allowing the minesweepers to finally clear the fields unmolested by Ottoman fire. The British ships initially succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on the fortresses, but the battleship and then &quot;Inflexible&quot; began taking serious damage from the coastal batteries. The French battleships also began to take damage, and the battleship struck a mine and exploded.

The French ships began to retreat, but &quot;Canopus&quot; and the other British battleships continued the bombardment. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Inflexible&quot; struck a mine and was badly damaged but managed to withdraw. The battleships &quot;Irresistible&quot; and also struck mines and both sank, forcing the British to break off the attack. After that attack, &quot;Canopus&quot; and protected cruiser escorted the damaged &quot;Inflexible&quot; from Mudros to Malta on 6 April. In heavy weather and with &quot;Inflexible&quot; nearly foundering, &quot;Canopus&quot; had to take the crippled battlecruiser under tow, stern first, during the last six hours of the voyage on 10 April. Returning to the Dardanelles, &quot;Canopus&quot; took part in the blockade of Smyrna and covered a diversionary attack on Bulair during the main landings on 25 April 1915. She supported Anzac forces ashore in May, including during a strong Ottoman counterattack on 19 May. When her sister ship &quot;Albion&quot; became stranded on a sandbank off Gaba Tepe under heavy fire on 22–23 May 1915, &quot;Canopus&quot; towed her free. On 25 May, &quot;Canopus&quot; withdrew to Mudros and while leaving the Dardanelles, encountered the German U-boat , which went on to sink the battleship later that day. &quot;Canopus&quot; then underwent a refit at Malta from May to June 1915.

====Fate====
After the Dardanelles campaign ended with the evacuation of Allied forces from Gallipoli in January 1916, &quot;Canopus&quot; was assigned to the British Eastern Mediterranean Squadron, where she served until she returned to the United Kingdom in April 1916. &quot;Canopus&quot; arrived at Plymouth on 22 April 1916, then paid off at Chatham to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels. She remained at Chatham until April 1916, undergoing a refit there later in 1916, having her eight main-deck 6-inch (152 mm) guns replaced by four on the battery deck and her 12-pounder and 3-pounder guns replaced by light antiaircraft weapons in 1917, and becoming an accommodation ship in February 1918. &quot;Canopus&quot; was placed on the disposal list at Chatham in April 1919. She was sold for scrapping on 18 February 1920 and arrived at Dover on 26 February 1920 to be scrapped.

<doc id="192223" wikidata="Q223234" url="?curid=192223" title="Billy Wright (footballer, born 1924)">
<text>William Ambrose Wright (6 February 1924 – 3 September 1994) was an English footballer who played as a centre-back. He spent his entire club career at Wolverhampton Wanderers. The first footballer in the world to earn 100 international caps, Wright also held the record for longest unbroken run in competitive international football, with 70 consecutive appearances, although that was surpassed by Andoni Zubizarreta&#x27;s 86 consecutive appearances for Spain (1985–94). He also made a total of 105 appearances for England, captaining them a record 90 times, including during their campaigns at the 1950, 1954 and 1958 World Cup finals.

== Early life and education ==
Wright was born at 33 Belmont Road, Ironbridge, Shropshire, his father Thomas was a worker at the Coalbrookdale Company ironworks. He was educated at Madeley Wood Methodist School and Madeley Modern School, playing in the teams of both schools.

== Club career ==
After playing during March–April that year for Cradley Heath in a dual player-groundsman role, Wright&#x27;s association with Wolverhampton Wanderers began in 1938 when, after being encouraged by his school teacher to respond to a newspaper advertisement inviting boys for trials, he was taken on as a member of their ground staff. He was only 14 years old when he made his debut for Wolves for the B team game against Walsall Wood in the Walsall Minor League.

Wright had been accepted on an eight-month trial by Major Frank Buckley, who had initially told Billy that he was &quot;too small&quot; to be taken on. In early September 1939 League and Cup football was suspended due to the outbreak of World War II. 

On 23 September 1939 Wright, who was then fifteen, played his first match for the Wolves senior side in a friendly against West Bromwich Albion. Wolves beat the &quot;Baggies&quot; 5–3 in front of 5,000 fans at The Hawthorns. Along with Wolves team-mate Jimmy Mullen, Billy also played as a guest for Leicester City, playing as both a forward and a defender before he returned to Molineux in 1942. A broken ankle put his career in doubt but he recovered and joined the Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in 1943, serving as a Physical Training Instructor. Wright played for Wolves whenever possible and made over 100 appearances for Wolves in wartime football.

Wright made his official debut for Wolves in January 1946 against Lovells Athletic in the third round of the FA Cup. He became club captain soon after and with Wright leading the team, Wolves won the First Division title three times (1953–54, 1957–58 and 1958–59) as well as the FA Cup in 1949. He was a virtual ever-present, missing only 31 games for Wolves during the 1950s. He retired from playing in April 1959.

== International career ==

Wright&#x27;s performances for club saw him earn a call-up to the England team. His full debut came on 28 September 1946 in a thumping 7–2 win against Ireland. He was made captain in 1948, a role he held for 90 games until his retirement (an all-time record shared subsequently with Bobby Moore). In 1952, with his 42nd cap, he surpassed Bob Crompton&#x27;s appearance record for England, which had stood since 1914. In total, he made 70 consecutive full international appearances with 105 in all, scoring three times. He was also the first footballer in the world to earn 100 caps, reaching the landmark in a 1–0 victory over Scotland at Wembley on 11 April 1959. It was more than a decade before his record was broken by another player, Bobby Charlton.

More than 60 years later, just eight other players have made more appearances for the England side than Wright.

== Managerial career ==
Wright became manager of England&#x27;s youth team in 1960, before being appointed manager of Arsenal in 1962, replacing George Swindin. Initially Arsenal started strongly under Wright, finishing seventh in 1962–63 and qualifying for Europe for the first time in their history, but failed to build on this. Wright enjoyed mixed success with his signings, who included successes such as Bob Wilson, Joe Baker and Frank McLintock, but also less successful players such as Ian Ure.

Arsenal were unable to improve on their seventh in Wright&#x27;s first season in charge, and their form gradually declined. Wright won only 38.46% of his matches in charge, the lowest rate for any post-war Arsenal manager (caretaker managers excepted). After a poor 1965–66 season – where Arsenal finished 14th and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Blackburn Rovers (who finished bottom of the First Division) — Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966.

Football writer Brian Glanville, discussing Billy Wright&#x27;s time at Arsenal, wrote: &quot;he had neither the guile nor the authority to make things work and he reacted almost childishly to criticism&quot;.

== Life after football ==
Wright was a minor media personality, and his marriage to Joy Beverley of the Beverley Sisters occurred at a time long before the era of footballers being known for having celebrity girlfriends. This was in July 1958, by which time Wright was 34, and proved one of the most successful showbiz marriages.

After leaving Arsenal, Wright successfully overcame alcoholism and he later became a television pundit and Head of Sport for ATV and Central Television, before retiring in 1989. The following year, he joined the board of directors at Wolverhampton Wanderers as part of the takeover by Sir Jack Hayward.

On 7 August 1993, he presented Manchester United with the FA Charity Shield, which they won on penalties against Arsenal at Wembley Stadium. On 7 December that year he was present for the friendly game against Honved of Hungary which commemorated the re-opening of Molineux as a rebuilt 28,525-seat stadium. The redevelopment saw three new stands built at the stadium in the space of two years, with the one replacing the Waterloo Road Stand being designated the Billy Wright Stand.

Wright was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions: in May 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the EMI Studios in London&#x27;s St John&#x27;s Wood, and in January 1990, when Michael Aspel surprised him at Thames Television&#x27;s Teddington Studios. Wright went on to be appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 13 June 1959.

== Illness and death ==
Wright died from pancreatic cancer on 3 September 1994, aged 70, having been diagnosed with the illness earlier in the year. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered on the pitch at Molineux.

== Legacy ==
In 2009, English football agent Bryan Yeubrey began a public campaign to obtain a posthumous knighthood for Wright. The campaign received support from several thousand fans and many former professional players.

In 2008, Midland Metro named an AnsaldoBreda T-69 tram in his honour.

<text>The Opiliones (formerly Phalangida) are an order of arachnids,
colloquially known as harvestmen, harvesters, harvest spiders, or daddy longlegs (see below). , over 6,650 species of harvestmen have been discovered worldwide, although the total number of extant species may exceed 10,000. The order Opiliones includes five suborders: Cyphophthalmi, Eupnoi, Dyspnoi, Laniatores, and Tetrophthalmi, which were named in 2014.

Representatives of each extant suborder can be found on all continents except Antarctica.

Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million-year-old Rhynie cherts of Scotland, and 305-million-year-old rocks in France. These fossils look surprisingly modern, indicating that their basic body shape developed very early on, and, at least in some taxa, has changed little since that time.

Their phylogenetic position within the Arachnida is disputed; their closest relatives may be camel spiders (Solifugae) or a larger clade comprising horseshoe crabs, Ricinulei, and Arachnopulmonata (scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and Tetrapulmonata). Although superficially similar to and often misidentified as spiders (order Araneae), the Opiliones are a distinct order that is not closely related to spiders. They can be easily distinguished from long-legged spiders by their fused body regions and single pair of eyes in the middle of the cephalothorax. Spiders have a distinct abdomen that is separated from the cephalothorax by a constriction, and they have three to four pairs of eyes, usually around the margins of the cephalothorax.

== Description ==


The Opiliones are known for having exceptionally long legs relative to their body size; however, some species are short-legged. As in all Arachnida, the body in the Opiliones has two tagmata, the anterior cephalothorax or prosoma, and the posterior 10-segmented abdomen or opisthosoma. The most easily discernible difference between harvestmen and spiders is that in harvestmen, the connection between the cephalothorax and abdomen is broad, so that the body appears to be a single oval structure. Other differences include the fact that Opiliones have no venom glands in their chelicerae and thus pose no danger to humans.

They also have no silk glands and therefore do not build webs. In some highly derived species, the first five abdominal segments are fused into a dorsal shield called the scutum, which in most such species is fused with the carapace. Some such Opiliones only have this shield in the males. In some species, the two posterior abdominal segments are reduced. Some of them are divided medially on the surface to form two plates beside each other. The second pair of legs is longer than the others and function as antennae or feelers. In short-legged species, this may not be obvious.

The feeding apparatus (stomotheca) differs from most arachnids in that Opiliones can swallow chunks of solid food, not only liquids. The stomotheca is formed by extensions of the coxae of the pedipalps and the first pair of legs.

Most Opiliones, except for Cyphophthalmi, have long been thought to have a single pair of camera-type eyes in the middle of the head, oriented sideways. Eyes in Cyphophthalmi, when present, are located laterally, near the ozopores. A 305-million-year-old fossilized harvestman with two pairs of eyes was reported in 2014. This find suggested that the eyes in Cyphophthalmi are not homologous to the eyes of other harvestmen. Many cave-adapted species are eyeless, such as the Brazilian &quot;Caecobunus termitarum&quot; (Grassatores) from termite nests, &quot;Giupponia chagasi&quot; (Gonyleptidae) from caves, most species of Cyphophthalmi, and all species of the Guasiniidae. However, recent work studying the embryonic development of the species &quot;Phalangium opilio&quot; and some Laniatores revealed that harvestman in addition to a pair median eyes also have two sets of vestigial eyes: one median pair (homologous to those of horseshoe crabs and sea spiders), and one lateral pair (homologous to facetted eyes of horseshoe crabs and insects). This discovery suggests that the neuroanatomy of harvestmen is more primitive than derived arachnid groups, like spiders and scorpions. It also showed that the four-eyed fossil harvestman previously discovered is most likely a member of the suborder Eupnoi (true daddy-longlegs).
Harvestmen have a pair of prosomatic defensive scent glands (ozopores) that secrete a peculiar-smelling fluid when disturbed. In some species, the fluid contains noxious quinones. They do not have book lungs, and breathe through tracheae. A pair of spiracles is located between the base of the fourth pair of legs and the abdomen, with one opening on each side. In more active species, spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs. They have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax, and the copulation is direct as male Opiliones have a penis, unlike other arachnids. All species lay eggs.

Typical body length does not exceed , and some species are smaller than 1 mm, although the largest known species, &quot;Trogulus torosus&quot; (Trogulidae), grows as long as . The leg span of many species is much greater than the body length and sometimes exceeds and to in Southeast Asia. Most species live for a year.

==Behavior==


Many species are omnivorous, eating primarily small insects and all kinds of plant material and fungi. Some are scavengers, feeding upon dead organisms, bird dung, and other fecal material. Such a broad range is unusual in arachnids, which are typically pure predators. Most hunting harvestmen ambush their prey, although active hunting is also found. Because their eyes cannot form images, they use their second pair of legs as antennae to explore their environment. Unlike most other arachnids, harvestmen do not have a sucking stomach or a filtering mechanism. Rather, they ingest small particles of their food, thus making them vulnerable to internal parasites such as gregarines.

Although parthenogenetic species do occur, most harvestmen reproduce sexually. Except from small fossorial species in the suborder Cyphophthalmi, where the males deposit a spermatophore, mating involves direct copulation. The females store the sperm, which is aflagellate and immobile, at the tip of her ovipositor. The eggs are fertilized during oviposition. The males of some species offer a secretion (nuptial gift) from their chelicerae to the female before copulation. Sometimes, the male guards the female after copulation, and in many species, the males defend territories. In some species, males also exhibit post-copulatory behavior in which the male specifically seeks out and shakes the female&#x27;s sensory leg. This is believed to entice the female into mating a second time.

The female lays her eggs shortly after mating to several months later. Some species build nests for this purpose. A unique feature of harvestmen is that some species practice parental care, in which the male is solely responsible for guarding the eggs resulting from multiple partners, often against egg-eating females, and cleaning the eggs regularly. Paternal care has evolved at least three times independently: once in the clade Progonyleptoidellinae + Caelopyginae, once in the Gonyleptinae, and once in the Heteropachylinae. Maternal care in opiliones probably evolved due to natural selection, while paternal care appears to be the result of sexual selection. Depending on circumstances such as temperature, the eggs may hatch at any time after the first 20 days, up to about half a year after being laid. Harvestmen variously pass through four to eight nymphal instars to reach maturity, with most known species having six instars.

Most species are nocturnal and colored in hues of brown, although a number of diurnal species are known, some of which have vivid patterns in yellow, green, and black with varied reddish and blackish mottling and reticulation.

Many species of harvestmen easily tolerate members of their own species, with aggregations of many individuals often found at protected sites near water. These aggregations may number 200 individuals in the Laniatores, and more than 70,000 in certain Eupnoi. behavior is likely a strategy against climatic odds, but also against predators, combining the effect of scent secretions, and reducing the probability of any particular individual being eaten.

Harvestmen clean their legs after eating by drawing each leg in turn through their jaws.

== Antipredator defences ==
Predators of harvestmen include a variety of animals, including some mammals, amphibians, and other arachnids like spiders and scorpions. Opiliones display a variety of primary and secondary defences against predation, ranging from morphological traits such as body armour to behavioral responses to chemical secretions. Some of these defences have been attributed and restricted to specific groups of harvestmen.

=== Primary defences ===
Primary defences help the harvestmen avoid encountering a potential predator and include crypsis, aposematism, and mimicry.

==== Crypsis ====
Particular patterns or colour markings on harvestmen&#x27;s bodies can reduce detection by disrupting the animals&#x27; outlines or providing camouflage. Markings on legs can cause an interruption of the leg outline and loss of leg proportion recognition. Darker colourations and patterns function as camouflage when they remain motionless. Within the genus &quot;Leiobunum&quot; are multiple species with cryptic colouration that changes over ontogeny to match the microhabitat used at each life stage. Many species have also been able to camouflage their bodies by covering with secretions and debris from the leaf litter found in their environments. Some hard-bodied harvestmen have epizoic cyanobacteria and liverworts growing on their bodies that suggest potential benefits for camouflage against large backgrounds to avoid detection by diurnal predators.

==== Aposematism and mimicry ====
Some harvestmen have elaborate and brightly coloured patterns or appendages which contrast with the body colouration, potentially serving as an aposematic warning to potential predators. This mechanism is thought to be commonly used during daylight, when they could be easily seen by any predators.

Other harvestmen may exhibit mimicry to resemble other species&#x27; appearances. Some Gonyleptidae individuals that produce translucid secretions have orange markings on their carapaces. This may have an aposematic role by mimicking the colouration of glandular emissions of two other quinone-producing species. Mimicry (Müllerian mimicry) occurring between Brazilian harvestmen that resemble others could be explained by convergent evolution.

=== Secondary defences ===
Secondary defences allow for harvestmen to escape and survive from a predator after direct or indirect contact, including thanatosis, freezing, bobbing, autotomy, fleeing, stridulation, retaliation and chemical secretions.

==== Thanatosis ====
Some animals respond to attacks by simulating an apparent death to avoid either detection or further attacks. Arachnids such as spiders practise this mechanism when threatened or even to avoid being eaten by female spiders after mating. Thanatosis is used as a second line of defence when detected by a potential predator and is commonly observed within the Dyspnoi and Laniatores suborders, with individuals becoming rigid with legs either retracted or stretched.

==== Freezing ====
Freezing – or the complete halt of movement – has been documented in the family Sclerosomatidae. While this can mean an increased likelihood of immediate survival, it also leads to reduced food and water intake.

==== Bobbing ====
To deflect attacks and enhance escape, long-legged species – commonly known as daddy long-legs – from the Eupnoi suborder, use two mechanisms. One is bobbing, for which these particular individuals bounce their bodies. It potentially serves to confuse and deflect any identification of the exact location of their bodies. This can be a deceiving mechanism to avoid predation when they are in a large aggregation of individuals, which are all trembling at the same time. Cellar spiders (Pholcidae) that are commonly mistaken for daddy long-legs (Opiliones) also exhibit this behavior when their webs are disturbed or even during courtship.

==== Autotomy ====

Autotomy is the voluntary amputation of an appendage and is employed to escape when restrained by a predator. Eupnoi individuals, more specifically sclerosomatid harvestmen, commonly use this strategy in response to being captured. This strategy can be costly because harvestmen do not regenerate their legs, and leg loss reduces locomotion, speed, climbing ability, sensory perception, food detection, and territoriality.

Autotomised legs provide a further defence from predators because they can twitch for 60 seconds to an hour after detachment. This can also potentially serve as deflection from an attack and deceive a predator from attacking the animal. It has been shown to be successful against ants and spiders.

The legs continue to twitch after they are detached because &#x27;pacemakers&#x27; are located in the ends of the first long segment (femur) of their legs. These pacemakers send signals via the nerves to the muscles to extend the leg and then the leg relaxes between signals. While some harvestman&#x27;s legs twitch for a minute, others have been recorded to twitch up to an hour. The twitching has been hypothesised to function as an evolutionary advantage by keeping the attention of a predator while the harvestman escapes.

==== Fleeing ====
Individuals that are able to detect potential threats can flee rapidly from attack. This is seen with multiple long-legged species in the Leiobunum clade that either drop and run, or drop and remain motionless. This is also seen when disturbing an aggregation of multiple individuals, where they all scatter.

==== Stridulation ====
Multiple species within the Laniatores and Dyspnoi possess stridulating organs, which are used as intraspecific communication and have also been shown to be used as a second line of defense when restrained by a predator.

==== Retaliation ====
Armored harvestmen in Laniatores can often use their modified morphology as weapons. Many have spines on their pedipalps, back legs, or bodies. By pinching with their chelicerae and pedipalps, they can cause harm to a potential predator. Also this has been proven to increase survival against recluse spiders by causing injury, allowing the harvestman to escape from predation.

==== Chemical ====
Harvestmen are well known for being chemically protected. They exude strongly odored secretions from their scent glands, called ozopores, that act as a shield against predators; this is the most effective defense they use which creates a strong and unpleasant taste. In &quot;Cyphophthalmi&quot; the scent glands release naphthoquinones, chloro-naphthoquinones and aliphatic methyl ketones, &quot;Insidiatores&quot; use nitrogen-containing substances, terpenes, aliphatic ketones, and phenolics, while &quot;Grassatores&quot; use alkylated phenolics and benzoquinones, and &quot;Palpatores&quot; use substances like naphthoquinones, methyl- and ethyl-ketones. These secretions have successfully protected the harvestmen against wandering spiders (Ctenidae), wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and &quot;Formica exsectoides&quot; ants. However, these chemical irritants are not able to prevent four species of harvestmen being preyed upon by the black scorpion &quot;Bothriurus bonariensis&quot; (Bothriuridae). These secretions contain multiple volatile compounds that vary among individuals and clades.

==Endangered status==
All troglobitic species (of all animal taxa) are considered to be at least threatened in Brazil. Four species of Opiliones are on the Brazilian national list of endangered species, all of them cave-dwelling: &quot;Giupponia chagasi&quot;, &quot;Iandumoema uai&quot;, &quot;Pachylospeleus strinatii&quot; and &quot;Spaeleoleptes spaeleus&quot;.

Several Opiliones in Argentina appear to be vulnerable, if not endangered. These include &quot;Pachyloidellus fulvigranulatus&quot;, which is found only on top of Cerro Uritorco, the highest peak in the Sierras Chicas chain (provincia de Cordoba) and &quot;Pachyloides borellii&quot; is in rainforest patches in northwest Argentina which are in an area being dramatically destroyed by humans. The cave-living &quot;Picunchenops spelaeus&quot; is apparently endangered through human action. So far, no harvestman has been included in any kind of a Red List in Argentina, so they receive no protection.

&quot;Maiorerus randoi&quot; has only been found in one cave in the Canary Islands. It is included in the Catálogo Nacional de especies amenazadas (National catalog of threatened species) from the Spanish government.

&quot;Texella reddelli&quot; and &quot;Texella reyesi&quot; are listed as endangered species in the United States. Both are from caves in central Texas. &quot;Texella cokendolpheri&quot; from a cave in central Texas and &quot;Calicina minor&quot;, &quot;Microcina edgewoodensis&quot;, &quot;Microcina homi&quot;, &quot;Microcina jungi&quot;, &quot;Microcina leei&quot;, &quot;Microcina lumi&quot;, and &quot;Microcina tiburona&quot; from around springs and other restricted habitats of central California are being considered for listing as endangered species, but as yet receive no protection.

An urban legend claims that the harvestman is the most venomous animal in the world; however, it possesses fangs too short or a mouth too round and small to bite a human, rendering it harmless (the same myth applies to &quot;Pholcus phalangioides&quot; and the crane fly, which are both also called a &quot;daddy longlegs&quot;). None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and not strong enough to break human skin.

==Research==
Harvestmen are a scientifically neglected group. Description of new taxa has always been dependent on the activity of a few dedicated taxonomists. Carl Friedrich Roewer described about a third (2,260) of today&#x27;s known species from the 1910s to the 1950s, and published the landmark systematic work (Harvestmen of the World) in 1923, with descriptions of all species known to that time. Other important taxonomists in this field include:

*Pierre André Latreille (18th century)
*Carl Ludwig Koch, Maximilian Perty (1830s–1850s)
*L. Koch, Tord Tamerlan Teodor Thorell (1860s–1870s)
*Eugène Simon, William Sørensen (1880s–1890s)
*James C. Cokendolpher, Raymond Forster, Clarence and Marie Goodnight, Jürgen Gruber, Reginald Frederick Lawrence, Jochen Martens, Cândido Firmino de Mello-Leitão (20th century)
*Gonzalo Giribet, Adriano Brilhante Kury, Tone Novak (21st century)

Since the 1990s, study of the biology and ecology of harvestmen has intensified, especially in South America.

Early work on the developmental biology of Opiliones from the mid-20th century was resurrected by Prashant P. Sharma, who established &quot;Phalangium opilio&quot; as a model system for the study of arachnid comparative genomics and evolutionary-developmental biology.

==Phylogeny==

Harvestmen are ancient arachnids. Fossils from the Devonian Rhynie chert, 410 million years ago, already show characteristics like tracheae and sexual organs, indicating that the group has lived on land since that time. Despite being similar in appearance to, and often confused with, spiders, they are probably closely related to the scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and solifuges; these four orders form the clade Dromopoda. The Opiliones have remained almost unchanged morphologically over a long period. Indeed, one species discovered in China, &quot;Mesobunus martensi&quot;, fossilized by fine-grained volcanic ash around 165 million years ago, is hardly discernible from modern-day harvestmen and has been placed in the extant family Sclerosomatidae.

==Systematics==

The interfamilial relationships within Opiliones are not yet fully resolved, although significant strides have been made in recent years to determine these relationships. The following list is a compilation of interfamilial relationships recovered from several recent phylogenetic studies, although the placement and even monophyly of several taxa are still in question.

The family Stygophalangiidae (one species, &quot;Stygophalangium karamani&quot;) from underground waters in North Macedonia is sometimes misplaced in the Phalangioidea. It is not a harvestman.

==Fossil record==
Despite their long history, few harvestman fossils are known. This is mainly due to their delicate body structure and terrestrial habitat, making them unlikely to be found in sediments. As a consequence, most known fossils have been preserved within amber.

The oldest known harvestman, from the 410-million-year-old Devonian Rhynie chert, displayed almost all the characteristics of modern species, placing the origin of harvestmen in the Silurian, or even earlier. A recent molecular study of Opiliones, however, dated the origin of the order at about 473 million years ago (Mya), during the Ordovician.

No fossils of the Cyphophthalmi or Laniatores much older than 50 million years are known, despite the former presenting a basal clade, and the latter having probably diverged from the Dyspnoi more than 300 Mya.

Naturally, most finds are from comparatively recent times. More than 20 fossil species are known from the Cenozoic, three from the Mesozoic, and at least seven from the Paleozoic.

===Paleozoic===
The 410-million-year-old &quot;Eophalangium sheari&quot; is known from two specimens, one a female, the other a male. The female bears an ovipositor and is about long, whilst the male had a discernable penis. Whether both specimens belong to the same species is not definitely known. They have long legs, tracheae, and no median eyes. Together with the 305-million-year-old &quot;Hastocularis argus&quot;, it forms the suborder Tetrophthalmi, which was though to form the sister group to Cyphophthalmi. However, recent reanalysis of harvestman phylogeny has shown that &quot;E. sheari&quot; and &quot;H. argus&quot; are in fact members of the suborder Eupnoi, after it was discovered that living daddy-longlegs have the same arrangement of eyes as the fossils.

&quot;Brigantibunum listoni&quot; from East Kirkton near Edinburgh in Scotland is almost 340 million years old. Its placement is rather uncertain, apart from it being a harvestman.

From about 300 Mya, several finds are from the Coal Measures of North America and Europe. While the two described &quot;Nemastomoides&quot; species are currently grouped as Dyspnoi, they look more like Eupnoi.

&quot;Kustarachne tenuipes&quot; was shown in 2004 to be a harvestman, after residing for almost one hundred years in its own arachnid order, the &quot;Kustarachnida&quot;.

Some fossils from the Permian are possibly harvestmen, but these are not well preserved.

etc. Bartel et al, 2023 report &quot;These new records bring the total number of Burmese amber laniatorean species to ten&quot;

* &quot;Halitherses grimaldii&quot;, a long-legged Dyspnoi with large eyes, was found in Burmese amber dating from approximately 100 Mya. It has been suggested that this may be related to the Ortholasmatinae (Nemastomatidae).

Currently, no fossil harvestmen are known from the Triassic. So far, they are also absent from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil, a Lagerstätte that has yielded many other terrestrial arachnids. An unnamed long-legged harvestman was reported from the Early Cretaceous of Koonwarra, Victoria, Australia, which may be a Eupnoi.

== Etymology ==

The Swedish naturalist and arachnologist Carl Jakob Sundevall (1801–1875) honored the naturalist Martin Lister (1638–1712) by adopting Lister&#x27;s term for this order, from Latin (“shepherd”), because these arachnids were known in Lister&#x27;s days as &quot;&quot;; Lister characterized three species from England (although not formally describing them, being a pre-Linnaean work).

In England, the Opiliones are often called &quot; or &quot;. Folk-etymological explanations for this are numerous, such as that they appear during harvest season, or because of a superstitious belief that if one is killed there will be a bad harvest that year, but these are unfounded. More likely, as in other European languages which call them a word meaning “cutter” or “scyther”, the original explanation is that their oddly shaped legs look like tiny sickles or scythes. The alternative name &quot;shepherd spiders&quot; is sometimes attributed to the assumption that Englishmen knew of the shepherds in the Landes region of France who traditionally used stilts to better observe their wandering flocks from a distance, and so were reminded of them by the long-legged arachnid, but is much more likely just an extension of this agricultural imagery, with the farmer&#x27;s implement changed to a shepherd&#x27;s crook rather than a reaping tool. Compare similar developments in the Dutch words for Opiliones: (literally meaning “hay-wagon”) and in southern dialects (literally “cowherd”, one who herds cattle).

English speakers may colloquially refer to species of Opiliones as &quot;&quot; or &quot;granddaddy longlegs&quot;. However, this name is also used for two other distantly related groups of arthropods: the crane flies of the superfamily Tipuloidea, as well as the cellar spiders of the family Pholcidae (which may be distinguished as &quot;&quot;), because of their similar appearance.

<text>USS &quot;Utah&quot; (BB-31/AG-16) was the second of two dreadnought battleships. The first ship of the United States Navy named after the state of Utah, she had one sister ship, . &quot;Utah&quot; was built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, laid down in March 1909 and launched in December of that year. She was completed in August 1911, and was armed with a main battery of ten guns in five twin gun turrets.

&quot;Utah&quot; and &quot;Florida&quot; were the first ships to arrive during the United States occupation of Veracruz in 1914 during the Mexican Revolution. The two battleships sent ashore a landing party that began the occupation of the city. After the American entrance into World War I, &quot;Utah&quot; was stationed at Berehaven in Bantry Bay, Ireland, where she protected convoys from potential German surface raiders. Throughout the 1920s, the ship conducted numerous training cruises and fleet maneuvers, and carried dignitaries on tours of South America twice, in 1924 and 1928.

In 1931, &quot;Utah&quot; was demilitarized and converted into a target ship and re-designated as AG-16, in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty signed the previous year. She was also equipped with numerous anti-aircraft guns of different types to train gunners for the fleet. She served in these two roles for the rest of the decade, and late 1941 found the ship in Pearl Harbor. She was in port on the morning of 7 December, and in the first minutes of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, was hit by two torpedoes, which caused serious flooding. &quot;Utah&quot; quickly rolled over and sank; 58 men were killed, but the vast majority of her crew were able to escape. The wreck remains in the harbor, and in 1972, a memorial was erected near the ship.

==Design==

&quot;Utah&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by four-shaft Parsons steam turbines rated at and twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She had a crew of 1,001 officers and men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of ten 12-inch/45 Mark 5 guns in five twin gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward. The other three turrets were placed aft of the superstructure. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen /51 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull. As was standard for capital ships of the period, she carried a pair of torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside. The main armored belt was thick, while the armored deck was thick. The gun turrets had thick faces and the conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==
===Construction – 1922===
&quot;Utah&quot; was laid down at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation on 15 March 1909. She was launched on 23 December 1909 and was commissioned into the United States Navy on 31 August 1911. She then conducted a shakedown cruise that stopped in Hampton Roads, Santa Rosa Island, Pensacola, Galveston, Kingston, Jamaica, and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. She was then assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in March 1912, after which time she participated in gunnery drills. She underwent an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard starting on 16 April. &quot;Utah&quot; left New York on 1 June and proceeded to Annapolis by way of Hampton Roads, arriving on 6 June. From there, she took a crew of naval cadets from the Naval Academy on a midshipman training cruise off the coast of New England, which lasted until 25 August.

For the next two years, &quot;Utah&quot; followed a similar routine of training exercises and midshipman cruises in the Atlantic. During the period 8–30 November 1913, &quot;Utah&quot; made a goodwill cruise to European waters, which included a stop in Villefranche, France. In early 1914 during the Mexican Revolution, the United States decided to intervene in the fighting. While en route to Mexico on 16 April, &quot;Utah&quot; was ordered to intercept the German-flagged steamer , which was carrying arms to the Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta. &quot;Ypiranga&quot;″s arrival in Veracruz prompted the US to occupy the city; &quot;Utah&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Florida&quot; were the first American vessels on the scene. The two ships landed a combined contingent of a thousand Marines and Bluejackets to begin the occupation of the city on 21 April. Over the next three days, the Marines battled rebels in the city and suffered 94 casualties, while killing hundreds of Mexicans in return.
&quot;Utah&quot; remained off Veracruz for two months, before she returned to the New York Navy Yard for an overhaul in late June. She spent the next three years conducting the normal routine of training with the Atlantic Fleet. On 6 April 1917, the United States entered World War I, declaring war on Germany over its unrestricted submarine warfare campaign against Britain. &quot;Utah&quot; was stationed in Chesapeake Bay to train engine room personnel and gunners for the rapidly expanding fleet until 30 August 1918, when she departed for Bantry Bay, Ireland with Vice Admiral Henry T. Mayo, Commander-in-Chief of the Atlantic Fleet aboard. After arriving in Ireland, &quot;Utah&quot; was assigned as the flagship of Battleship Division 6 (BatDiv 6), commanded by Rear Admiral Thomas S. Rodgers. BatDiv 6 was tasked with covering convoys in the Western Approaches against possible attacks from German surface raiders. &quot;Utah&quot; served in the division along with and .

Following the end of the war in November 1918, &quot;Utah&quot; visited the Isle of Portland in Britain, and escorted the liner in December, which carried President Woodrow Wilson to Brest, France, for the post-war peace negotiations at Versailles. &quot;Utah&quot; left Brest on 14 December, and arrived in New York on the 25th of the month. She remained there until 30 January 1919, after which time she returned to the normal peacetime routine of fleet exercises and training cruises. On 9 July 1921, &quot;Utah&quot; departed for Europe, stopping in Lisbon, Portugal, and Cherbourg, France. After arriving, she became the flagship of American warships in Europe. She carried on in this role until she was relieved by the armored cruiser in October 1922.

===1922–1941===
&quot;Utah&quot; returned to the US on 21 October, where she returned to her old post as the flagship of BatDiv 6. In early 1924, &quot;Utah&quot; took part in the Fleet Problem III maneuvers, where she and her sister &quot;Florida&quot; acted as stand-ins for the new s. Later that year, &quot;Utah&quot; was chosen to carry the US diplomatic mission to the 9 December centennial celebration of the Battle of Ayacucho, which had taken place on that date in 1824. She left New York on 22 November with General of the Armies John J. Pershing aboard for a goodwill tour of South America; &quot;Utah&quot; arrived at Callao, Peru, on 9 December. At the conclusion of Pershing&#x27;s tour, &quot;Utah&quot; met him at Montevideo, Uruguay, and then carried him to other ports, including Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, La Guaira, Venezuela, and Havana, Cuba. The tour ultimately ended when &quot;Utah&quot; returned Pershing to New York on 13 March 1925. &quot;Utah&quot; conducted midshipman training cruises over the summer of 1925. She was decommissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 31 October 1925, and placed in drydock for modernization. The modernization replaced her coal-fired boilers with new oil-fired models, and her aft cage mast was replaced with a pole mast. She was reboilered with four White-Forster oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and battlecruisers scrapped as a result of the Washington Naval Treaty. &quot;Utah&quot; also had a catapult mounted on her Number 3 turret along with cranes for handling floatplanes. 

&quot;Utah&quot; returned to active duty on 1 December, after which she served with the Scouting Fleet. She left Hampton Roads on 21 November 1928 for another South American cruise. This time, she picked up President-elect Herbert C. Hoover and his entourage in Montevideo, and transported them to Rio de Janeiro in December, and then carried them home to the United States, arriving in Hampton Roads on 6 January 1929. According to the terms of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, &quot;Utah&quot; was converted into a radio-controlled target ship, to replace the older . On 1 July 1931, &quot;Utah&quot; was accordingly redesignated &quot;AG-16&quot;. All of her primary and secondary weapons were removed, though her turrets were still mounted. The plane handling equipment was removed along with the torpedo blisters that were added in 1925. Work was completed by 1 April 1932, when she was recommissioned.

On 7 April, &quot;Utah&quot; left Norfolk for sea trials to train her engine room crew and to test the radio-control equipment. The ship could be controlled at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, opened and closed throttle valves, moved her steering gear, and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers. In addition, a Sperry gyro pilot kept the ship on course. She passed her radio control trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control. On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for San Pedro, Los Angeles, where she joined Training Squadron 1, Base Force, United States Fleet. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and then for the battleship &quot;Nevada&quot;. She continued in this role for the next nine years; she participated in Fleet Problem XVI in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines. In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners in addition to her target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new /75 caliber anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.

&quot;Utah&quot; returned to the Atlantic to participate in Fleet Problem XX in January 1939, and at the end of the year, she trained with Submarine Squadron 6. She then returned to the Pacific, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 1 August 1940. There, she conducted anti-aircraft gunnery training until 14 December, when she departed for Long Beach, California, arriving on 21 December. There, she served as a bombing target for aircraft from the carriers , , and . She returned to Pearl Harbor on 1 April 1941, where she resumed anti-aircraft gunnery training. She cruised to Los Angeles on 20 May to carry a contingent of Marines from the Fleet Marine Force to Bremerton, Washington, after which she entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 31 May, where she was overhauled. She was equipped with new /38 cal dual-purpose guns in single mounts to improve her ability to train anti-aircraft gunners. She left Puget Sound on 14 September, bound for Pearl Harbor, where she resumed her normal duties through the rest of the year.

===Attack on Pearl Harbor===

In early December 1941, &quot;Utah&quot; was moored off Ford Island in berth F-11, after having completed another round of anti-aircraft gunnery training. Shortly before 08:00 on the morning of 7 December, some crewmen aboard &quot;Utah&quot; observed the first Japanese planes approaching to attack Pearl Harbor, but they assumed they were American aircraft. The Japanese began their attack shortly thereafter, the first bombs falling near a seaplane ramp on the southern tip of Ford Island. At the same time sixteen Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers from the Japanese aircraft carriers and flew over Pearl City approaching the west side of Ford Island. The torpedo bombers were looking for American aircraft carriers, which usually anchored where &quot;Utah&quot; was moored that morning. The flight leaders identified &quot;Utah&quot; and rejected her as a target, deciding instead to attack 1010 Dock. However six of the B5Ns from &quot;Soryu&quot; led by Lieutenant Nakajima Tatsumi broke off to attack &quot;Utah&quot;, not recognizing that the shapes over the barbettes were not turrets, but boxes covering empty holes. Six torpedoes were launched against &quot;Utah&quot;, two of them struck the battleship while another missed and hit the cruiser .

Serious flooding started to quickly overwhelm &quot;Utah&quot; and she began to list to port and settle by the stern. As the crew began to abandon ship, one man—Chief Watertender Peter Tomich—remained below decks to ensure as many men as possible could escape, and to keep vital machinery running as long as possible; he received the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions. At 08:12, &quot;Utah&quot; rolled over onto her side, while those crew members who had managed to escape swam to shore. Almost immediately after reaching shore, the ship&#x27;s senior officer on board, Commander Solomon Isquith, heard knocking from men trapped in the capsized ship. He called for volunteers to secure a cutting torch from the badly damaged cruiser &quot;Raleigh&quot; and attempt to free trapped men; they succeeded in rescuing four men. In total, 58 officers and men were killed, though 461 survived.

===Salvage===
The Navy declared &quot;Utah&quot; to be in ordinary on 29 December, and she was placed under the authority of the Pearl Harbor Base Force. Following the successful righting (rotation to upright) of the capsized &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, an attempt was made to right the &quot;Utah&quot; by the same parbuckling method using 17 winches. As &quot;Utah&quot; was rotated, she did not grip the harbor bottom, and slid towards Ford Island. The &quot;Utah&quot; recovery effort was abandoned, with &quot;Utah&quot; rotated 38 degrees from horizontal.

As abandoned, &quot;Utah&quot; cleared her berth. There was no further attempt to refloat her; unlike the battleships sunk at Battleship Row, she had no military value. She was formally placed out of commission on 5 September 1944, and then stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November. &quot;Utah&quot; received one battle star for her brief service during World War II. Her rusting hulk remains in Pearl Harbor, partially above water; the men killed when &quot;Utah&quot; sank were never removed from the wreck, and as such, she is considered a war grave.

==Memorial==
Around 1950, two memorials were placed at the wreck dedicated to the men in the ship&#x27;s crew who were killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The first is a plaque on the wharf to the north of the ship, and the second is a plaque that was placed on the ship itself. In 1972, a larger memorial was erected just off Ford Island, near the sunken wreck, and is now part of Pearl Harbor National Memorial. The memorial consists of a walkway made of white concrete, which extends from Ford Island out to a platform in front of the ship, where a brass plaque and a flagpole are located. The memorial is on the northwest side of Ford Island and is accessible only to individuals with military identification. A color guard stands watch over the wreck. On 9 July 1988, &quot;Utah&quot; and , the other remaining wreck in the harbor, were nominated to be added to the National Historic Landmark registry. Both wrecks were added to the list on 5 May 1989. As of 2008, seven former crewmen who were aboard &quot;Utah&quot; at the time of her sinking have been cremated and had their ashes interred in the wreck.

Relics from the ship are also preserved in the Utah State Capitol building; among the items on display are pieces from the ship&#x27;s silver service and the captain&#x27;s clock. The ship&#x27;s bell was on display at the University of Utah near the entrance of the Naval Science Building from the 1960s until 2016, when it was loaned to the Naval War College. It was then sent to the Naval History and Heritage Command in Richmond, Virginia for conservation work. With the bell restored, it was returned to the University of Utah on 7 December 2017 and is currently on display inside the Naval Science Building.

<text>An almanac (also spelled almanack and almanach) is a regularly published listing of a set of current information about one or multiple subjects. It includes information like weather forecasts, farmers&#x27; planting dates, tide tables, and other tabular data often arranged according to the calendar. Celestial figures and various statistics are found in almanacs, such as the rising and setting times of the Sun and Moon, dates of eclipses, hours of high and low tides, and religious festivals. The set of events noted in an almanac may be tailored for a specific group of readers, such as farmers, sailors, or astronomers.

== Name ==
The etymology of the word is unclear. The earliest documented use of the word in something like its current sense is in Latin in 1267. Roger Bacon used it to mean a set of tables detailing movements of heavenly bodies including the Moon.

It has been suggested that the word &quot;almanac&quot; derives from a Greek word meaning &quot;calendar&quot;. However, that word appears only once in antiquity, by Eusebius who quotes Porphyry as to the Coptic Egyptian use of astrological charts (&quot;almenichiaká&quot;). The earliest almanacs were calendars that included agricultural, astronomical, or meteorological data. But it is highly unlikely Roger Bacon received the word from this etymology: &quot;Notwithstanding the suggestive sound and use of this word (of which however the real form is very uncertain), the difficulties of connecting it historically either with the Spanish Arabic manākh, or with Medieval Latin without Arabic intermediation, seem insurmountable.&quot;

One etymology report says &quot;The ultimate source of the word is obscure. Its first syllable, al-, and its general relevance to medieval science and technology, strongly suggest an Arabic origin, but no convincing candidate has been found&quot;. Ernest Weekley similarly states of &quot;almanac&quot;: &quot;First seen in Roger Bacon. Apparently from Spanish Arabic, &quot;al-manakh&quot;, but this is not an Arabic word...The word remains a puzzle.&quot; Walter William Skeat concludes that the construction of an Arabic origin is &quot;not satisfactory&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; similarly says &quot;the word has no etymon in Arabic&quot; but indirect circumstantial evidence &quot;points to a Spanish Arabic &quot;al-manākh&quot;&quot;. The Oxford Dictionary of English says that the word origin is &quot;via Old French and medieval Latin from Spanish Arabic al-manāk (&#x27;the calendar&#x27;)&quot;.

The reason why the proposed Arabic word is speculatively spelled &quot;al-manākh&quot; is that the spelling occurred as &quot;almanach&quot;, as well as almanac (and Roger Bacon used both spellings). The earliest use of the word was in the context of astronomy calendars. The Arabic word has different meanings in contemporary Arabic than in classical Arabic usage. The word originally meant &quot;the place where camels kneel [so riders and baggage can disembark]&quot;. In contemporary Arabic, the word means &quot;climate&quot;.

The prestige of the Tables of Toledo and other medieval Arabic astronomy works at the time of the word&#x27;s emergence in the West, together with the absence of the word in Arabic, suggest it may have been invented in the West and is pseudo-Arabic. At that time in the West, it would have been prestigious to attach an Arabic appellation to a set of astronomical tables. Also around that time, prompted by that motive, the Latin writer Pseudo-Geber wrote under an Arabic pseudonym. (The later alchemical word &quot;alkahest&quot; is known to be pseudo-Arabic.)

== History ==

=== Hemerologies and parapegmata ===

The earlier texts considered to be almanacs have been found in the Near East, dating back to the middle of the second millennium BC. They have been called generally hemerologies, from the Greek word &quot;hēmerologion&quot;, &quot;calendar&quot; (from &quot;hēmera&quot;, meaning &quot;day&quot;). Among them is the so-called Babylonian Almanac, which lists favorable and unfavorable days with advice on what to do on each of them. Successive variants and versions aimed at different readership have been found. Egyptian lists of good and bad moments, three times each day, have also been found. Many of these prognostics were connected with celestial events. The flooding of the Nile valley, a most important event in ancient Egypt, was expected to occur at the summer solstice, but as the civil calendar had exactly 365 days, over the centuries, the date was drifting in the calendar. The first heliacal rising of Sirius was used for its prediction and this practice, the observation of some star and its connecting to some event apparently spread.

The Greek almanac, known as parapegma, has existed in the form of an inscribed stone on which the days of the month were indicated by movable pegs inserted into bored holes, hence the name. There were also written texts and according to Diogenes Laërtius, &quot;Parapegma&quot; was the title of a book by Democritus. Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer (2nd century) wrote a treatise, &quot;Phaseis&quot;—&quot;phases of fixed stars and collection of weather-changes&quot; is the translation of its full title—the core of which is a &quot;parapegma&quot;, a list of dates of seasonally regular weather changes, first appearances and last appearances of stars or constellations at sunrise or sunset, and solar events such as solstices, all organized according to the solar year. With the astronomical computations were expected weather phenomena, composed as a digest of observations made by various authorities of the past. &quot;Parapegmata&quot; had been composed for centuries. Ptolemy believed that astronomical phenomena caused the changes in seasonal weather; his explanation of why there was not an exact correlation of these events was that the physical influences of other heavenly bodies also came into play. Hence for him, weather prediction was a special division of astrology.

Surviving Roman menologia rustica combined schedules of solar information and agricultural activities throughout the year with the months&#x27; tutelary deities and major festivals. By the imperial period, each month was headed with illustrations of its chief astrological signs, matching Roman geoponical tracts that often combined guidance for the proper conditions for different activities with the stars present during that period rather than using the civil calendar.

=== Ephemerides, zijs and tables ===

The origins of the almanac can be connected to ancient Babylonian astronomy, when tables of planetary periods were produced in order to predict lunar and planetary phenomena. Similar treatises called Zij were later composed in medieval Islamic astronomy.

The modern almanac differs from Babylonian, Ptolemaic and Zij tables in the sense that &quot;the entries found in the almanacs give directly the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation&quot;, in contrast to the more common &quot;auxiliary astronomical tables&quot; based on Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;. The earliest known almanac in this modern sense is the &quot;Almanac of Azarqueil&quot; written in 1088 by Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī (Latinized as Arzachel) in Toledo, al-Andalus. The work provided the true daily positions of the sun, moon and planets for four years from 1088 to 1092, as well as many other related tables. A Latin translation and adaptation of the work appeared as the &quot;Tables of Toledo&quot; in the 12th century and the &quot;Alfonsine tables&quot; in the 13th century.
=== Medieval examples ===
After almanacs were devised, people still saw little difference between predicting the movements of the stars and tides, and predicting the future in the divination sense. Early almanacs therefore contained general horoscopes, as well as natural information. An example is the folded almanac Western MS.8932 (Wellcome Collection, London), produced in England between 1387 and 1405, is a calendar with astrological tables and diagrams used by medical practitioners to harness astrological information relating to health. In 1150 Solomon Jarchus created such an almanac considered to be among the first modern examples. Copies of 12th century almanacs are found in the British Museum, and in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. In 1300, Petrus de Dacia created an almanac (Savilian Library, Oxford) the same year Roger Bacon, OFM, produced his own. In 1327 Walter de Elvendene created an almanac and later on John Somers of Oxford, in 1380. In 1386 Nicholas de Lynne, Oxford produced an almanac. In 1457 the first printed almanac was published at Mainz, by Gutenberg (eight years before the famous Bible). Regio-Montanus produced an almanac in 1472 (Nuremberg, 1472), which continued in print for several centuries. In 1497 the &quot;Sheapheard&#x27;s Kalendar&quot;, translated from French (Richard Pynson) became the first almanac to be printed in English.

=== Early modern era ===
==== England ====
By the second half of the 16th century, yearly almanacs were being produced in England by authors such as Anthony Askham, Thomas Buckminster, John Dade and Gabriel Frende. In the 17th century, English almanacs were bestsellers, second only to the Bible; by the middle of the century, 400,000 almanacs were being produced annually (a complete listing can be found in the English Short Title Catalogue). Until its deregulation in 1775, the Stationers&#x27; Company maintained a lucrative monopoly over almanac publication in England. Richard Allestree (not to be confused with Richard Allestree (1621/22–1681), provost of Eton College) wrote one of the more popular English almanacs, producing yearly volumes from 1617 to 1643, but his is by no means the earliest or the longest-running almanac.

Works that satirized this type of publication appeared in the late 1500s. During the next century, a writer using the pseudonym of &quot;Poor Richard, Knight of the Burnt Island&quot; began to publish a series of such parodies that were entitled &quot;Poor Robin&#x27;s Almanack&quot;. The 1664 issue of the series stated: &quot;This month we may expect to hear of the Death of some Man, Woman, or Child, either in Kent or Christendom.&quot;

==== British America and United States ====
The first almanac printed in the Thirteen Colonies of British America was William Pierce&#x27;s 1639 &quot;An Almanac Calculated for New England&quot;. The almanac was the first in a series of such publications that Stephen Daye, or Day, printed each year until 1649 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Cambridge/Boston area in Massachusetts soon became the first center in the colonies for the annual publication of almanacs, to be followed by Philadelphia during the first half of the eighteenth century.
Nathaniel Ames of Dedham, Massachusetts, issued his popular &quot;Astronomical Diary and Almanack&quot; in 1725 and annually after . James Franklin published &quot;The Rhode Island Almanack&quot; by &quot;Poor Robin&quot; for each year from 1728 to 1735. James&#x27; brother, Benjamin Franklin, published his annual &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; in Philadelphia from 1732 to 1758.

Samuel Stearns of Paxton, Massachusetts, issued the &quot;North-American Almanack&quot;, published annually from 1771 to 1784, as well as the first American nautical almanac, &quot;The Navigator&#x27;s Kalendar, or Nautical Almanack, for 1783&quot;. Andrew Ellicott of Ellicott&#x27;s Upper Mills, Maryland, authored a series of almanacs, &quot;The United States Almanack&quot;, the earliest known copy of which bears the date of 1782. Benjamin Banneker, a free African American living near Ellicott&#x27;s Mills, composed a series of almanacs for the years of 1792 to 1797.

=== Contemporary use ===

Currently published almanacs such as &quot;Whitaker&#x27;s Almanack&quot; have expanded their scope and contents beyond that of their historical counterparts. Modern almanacs include a comprehensive presentation of statistical and descriptive data covering the entire world. Contents also include discussions of topical developments and a summary of recent historical events. Other currently published almanacs (ca. 2006) include &quot;TIME Almanac with Information Please&quot;, &quot;World Almanac and Book of Facts&quot;, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Almanac&quot; and &quot;The Old Farmer&#x27;s Almanac&quot; and The Almanac for Farmers &amp; City Folk. The &quot;Inverness Almanac&quot;, an almanac/literary journal, was published in West Marin, California, from 2015 to 2016. In 2007, Harrowsmith Country Life Magazine launched a Canadian Almanac, written in Canada, with all-Canadian content. The nonprofit agrarian organization the Greenhorns currently publishes &quot;The New Farmer&#x27;s Almanac&quot; as a resource for young farmers.

Major topics covered by almanacs (reflected by their tables of contents) include: geography, government, demographics, agriculture, economics and business, health and medicine, religion, mass media, transportation, science and technology, sport, and awards/prizes.

Other examples include &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; published by Columbia Books &amp; Information Services, &quot;The Almanac of British Politics&quot;, the Wapsipinicon Almanac, and the Calendari dels Pagesos, a Catalan-language almanac published in Catalonia since 1861.

The GPS almanac, as part of the data transmitted by each GPS satellite, contains coarse orbit and status information for all satellites in the constellation, an ionospheric model, and information to relate GPS derived time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Hence the GPS almanac provides a similar goal as the ancient Babylonian almanac, to find celestial bodies.

National Geographic Kids annually publishes a series of books titled &quot;Almanac&quot; (e.g. &quot;Almanac 2025&quot;), which typically contain information on animals, science and technology, and the natural world, among other things.

<doc id="192232" wikidata="Q233320" url="?curid=192232" title="Scaffolding">
<text>Scaffolding, also called scaffold or staging, is a temporary structure used to support a work crew and materials to aid in the construction, maintenance and repair of buildings, bridges and all other human-made structures. Scaffolds are widely used on site to get access to heights and areas that would be otherwise hard to get to. Unsafe scaffolding has the potential to result in death or serious injury. Scaffolding is also used in adapted forms for formwork and shoring, grandstand seating, concert stages, access/viewing towers, exhibition stands, ski ramps, half pipes and art projects.

There are six main types of scaffolding used worldwide today. These are tube and coupler (fitting) components, prefabricated modular system scaffold components, H-frame / façade modular system scaffolds, suspended scaffolds, timber scaffolds and bamboo scaffolds (particularly in China, India and Hong Kong). Each type is made from several components which often include:
* A base jack or plate which is a load-bearing base for the scaffold. 
* The standard, the upright component with connector joins. 
* The ledger, a horizontal brace. 
* The transom, a horizontal cross-section load-bearing component which holds the batten, board, or decking unit. 
* Brace diagonal and/or cross section bracing component. 
* Batten or board decking component used to make the working platform. 
* Coupler, a fitting used to join components together. 
* Scaffold tie, used to tie in the scaffold to structures. 
* Brackets, used to extend the width of working platforms. 
Specialized components used to aid in their use as a temporary structure often include heavy duty load bearing transoms, ladders or stairway units for the ingress and egress of the scaffold, beams ladder/unit types used to span obstacles and rubbish chutes used to remove unwanted materials from the scaffold or construction project.

==History==

===Stone Age===

Sockets in the walls around the paleolithic cave paintings at Lascaux, suggest that a scaffold system was used for painting the ceiling, over 17,000 years ago.

===Antiquity===
The Berlin Foundry Cup depicts scaffolding in ancient Greece (early 5th century BC). Egyptians, Nubians and Chinese are also recorded as having used scaffolding-like structures to build tall buildings. Early scaffolding was made of wood and secured with rope knots.

===Modern era===

Scaffolding was erected by individual firms with wildly varying standards and sizes. The process was revolutionized by Daniel Palmer Jones and David Henry Jones. Modern day scaffolding standards, practices and processes can be attributed to these men and their companies: Rapid Scaffold Tie Company Ltd, Tubular Scaffolding Company and Scaffolding Great Britain Ltd (SGB).

David Henry Jones and Daniel Palmer Jones patented the &quot;Scaffixer&quot; in either 1907 or 1910, a coupling device far more robust than rope which revolutionized scaffolding construction. In 1913, his company was commissioned for the reconstruction of Buckingham Palace, during which his Scaffixer gained much publicity. Palmer-Jones followed this up with the improved &quot;Universal Coupler&quot; in 1919 - this soon became the industry standard coupling and has remained so to this day.

Advancements in metallurgy throughout the early 20th century saw the introduction of tubular steel water pipes (instead of timber poles) with standardized dimensions, allowing for the industrial interchangeability of parts and improving the structural stability of the scaffold. The use of diagonal bracings also helped to improve stability, especially on tall buildings. The first frame system was brought to market by SGB in 1944 and was used extensively for the postwar reconstruction.

The European Standard, BS EN 12811-1, specifies performance requirements and methods of structural and general design for access and working scaffolds. Requirements given are for scaffold structures that rely on the adjacent structures for stability. In general these requirements also apply to other types of working scaffolds.

The purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work. The European Standard sets out performance requirements for working scaffolds. These are substantially independent of the materials of which the scaffold is made. The standard is intended to be used as the basis for enquiry and design.

===Materials===
The basic components of scaffolding are tubes, couplers and boards.
The basic lightweight tube scaffolding that became the standard and revolutionised scaffolding, becoming the baseline for decades, was invented and marketed in the mid-1950s. With one basic 24 pound unit a scaffold of various sizes and heights could be assembled easily by a couple of labourers without the nuts or bolts previously needed.

Tubes are usually made either of steel or aluminium. Composite scaffolding uses filament-wound tubes of glass fibre in a nylon or polyester matrix. Because of the high cost of composite tube, it is usually only used when there is a risk from overhead electric cables that cannot be isolated. Steel tubes are either &#x27;black&#x27; or galvanised. The tubes come in a variety of lengths and a standard outside diameter of 48.3 mm. (1.5 NPS pipe). The chief difference between the two types of metal tubes is the lower weight of aluminium tubes (1.7 kg/m as opposed to 4.4 kg/m). Aluminium tube is more flexible and has a lower resistance to stress. Tubes are generally bought in 6.3 m lengths and can then be cut down to certain typical sizes. Most large companies will brand their tubes with their name and address in order to deter theft.

Boards provide a working surface for scaffold users. They are seasoned wood and come in three thicknesses (38 mm (usual), 50 mm and 63 mm) are a standard width (225 mm) and are a maximum of 3.9 m long. The board ends are protected either by metal plates called hoop irons or sometimes nail plates, which often have the company name stamped into them. Timber scaffold boards in the UK should comply with the requirements of BS 2482. As well as timber, steel or aluminium decking is used, as well as laminate boards. In addition to the boards for the working platform, there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect, although ordinary boards can also be used. Another solution, called a scaffpad, is made from a rubber base with a base plate moulded inside; these are desirable for use on uneven ground since they adapt, whereas sole boards may split and have to be replaced.
Couplers are the fittings which hold the tubes together. The most common are called scaffold couplers, and there are three basic types: &quot;right-angle couplers&quot;, &quot;putlog couplers&quot; and &quot;swivel couplers&quot;. To join tubes end-to-end &quot;joint pins&quot; (also called spigots) or &quot;sleeve couplers&quot; are used. Only right angle couplers and swivel couplers can be used to fix tube in a &#x27;load-bearing connection&#x27;. Single couplers are not load-bearing couplers and have no design capacity.

Other common scaffolding components include base plates, ladders, ropes, anchor ties, reveal ties, gin wheels, sheeting, etc.
Most companies will adopt a specific colour to paint the scaffolding with, in order that quick visual identification can be made in case of theft. All components that are made from metal can be painted but items that are wooden should never be painted as this could hide defects.
Despite the metric measurements given, many scaffolders measure tubes and boards in imperial units, with tubes from 21 feet down and boards from 13 ft down.

Bamboo scaffolding is widely used in Hong Kong and Macau, with nylon straps tied into knots as couplers. In India, bamboo or other wooden scaffolding is also mostly used, with poles being lashed together using ropes made from coconut hair (coir).

===Basic scaffolding===
The key elements of the scaffolding are &quot;the standard&quot;, &quot;ledger&quot; and &quot;transoms&quot;. The standards, also called uprights, are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square &quot;base plate&quot; to spread the load. The base plate has a shank in its centre to hold the tube and is sometimes pinned to a &quot;sole board&quot;. Ledgers are horizontal tubes which connect between the standards. Transoms rest upon the ledgers at right angles. &quot;Main transoms&quot; are placed next to the standards, they hold the standards in place and provide support for boards; &quot;intermediate transoms&quot; are those placed between the main transoms to provide extra support for boards. In Canada this style is referred to as &quot;English&quot;. &quot;American&quot; has the transoms attached to the standards and is used less but has certain advantages in some situations.
As well as the tubes at right angles there are &quot;cross braces&quot; to increase rigidity, these are placed diagonally from ledger to ledger, next to the standards to which they are fitted. If the braces are fitted to the ledgers they are called ledger braces. To limit sway a &quot;facade brace&quot; is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35°-55° running right from the base to the top of the scaffold and fixed at every level.

Of the couplers previously mentioned, right-angle couplers join ledgers or transoms to standards, putlog or single couplers join board bearing transoms to ledgers - Non-board bearing transoms should be fixed using a right-angle coupler. Swivel couplers are to connect tubes at any other angle. The actual joints are staggered to avoid occurring at the same level in neighbouring standards.
The spacings of the basic elements in the scaffold are fairly standard. For a general purpose scaffold the maximum bay length is 2.1 m, for heavier work the bay size is reduced to 2 or even 1.8 m while for inspection a bay width of up to 2.7 m is allowed.

The scaffolding width is determined by the width of the boards, the minimum width allowed is 600 mm but a more typical four-board scaffold would be 870 mm wide from standard to standard. More heavy-duty scaffolding can require 5, 6 or even up to 8 boards width. Often an &quot;inside board&quot; is added to reduce the gap between the inner standard and the structure.

The lift height, the spacing between ledgers, is 2 m, although the base lift can be up to 2.7 m. The diagram above also shows a kicker lift, which is just 150 mm or so above the ground.

Transom spacing is determined by the thickness of the boards supported, 38 mm boards require a transom spacing of no more than 1.2 m while a 50 mm board can stand a transom spacing of 2.6 m and 63 mm boards can have a maximum span of 3.25 m. The minimum overhang for all boards is 50 mm and the maximum overhang is no more than 4x the thickness of the board.

===Foundations===
Good foundations are essential. Often scaffold frameworks will require more than simple base plates to safely carry and spread the load. Scaffolding can be used without base plates on concrete or similar hard surfaces, although base plates are always recommended. For surfaces like pavements or tarmac base plates are necessary. For softer or more doubtful surfaces sole boards must be used, beneath a single standard a sole board should be at least with no dimension less than , the thickness must be at least . For heavier duty scaffold much more substantial baulks set in concrete can be required. On uneven ground steps must be cut for the base plates, a minimum step size of around is recommended. A working platform requires certain other elements to be safe. They must be close-boarded, have double guard rails and toe and stop boards. Safe and secure access must also be provided.


===Ties===
Scaffolds are only rarely independent structures. To provide stability for a scaffolding (at left) framework ties are generally fixed to the adjacent building/fabric/steelwork.

General practice is to attach a tie every 4 m on alternate lifts (traditional scaffolding). Prefabricated System scaffolds require structural connections at all frames - i.e. 2–3 m centres (tie patterns must be provided by the System manufacturer/supplier). The ties are coupled to the scaffold as close to the junction of standard and ledger (node point) as possible. Due to recent regulation changes, scaffolding ties must support +/- loads (tie/butt loads) and lateral (shear) loads.

Due to the different nature of structures there is a variety of different ties to take advantage of the opportunities.

&quot;Through ties&quot; are put through structure openings such as windows. A vertical inside tube crossing the opening is attached to the scaffold by a transom and a crossing horizontal tube on the outside called a bridle tube. The gaps between the tubes and the structure surfaces are packed or wedged with timber sections to ensure a solid fit.

&quot;Box ties&quot; are used to attach the scaffold to suitable pillars or comparable features. Two additional transoms are put across from the lift on each side of the feature and are joined on both sides with shorter tubes called tie tubes. When a complete box tie is impossible a l-shaped &quot;lip tie&quot; can be used to hook the scaffold to the structure, to limit inward movement an additional transom, a &quot;butt transom&quot;, is placed hard against the outside face of the structure.

Sometimes it is possible to use &quot;anchor ties&quot; (also called &quot;bolt ties&quot;), these are ties fitted into holes drilled in the structure. A common type is a ring bolt with an expanding wedge which is then tied to a node point.
The least &#x27;invasive&#x27; tie is a &quot;reveal tie&quot;. These use an opening in the structure but use a tube wedged horizontally in the opening. The reveal tube is usually held in place by a reveal screw pin (an adjustable threaded bar) and protective packing at either end. A transom tie tube links the reveal tube to the scaffold. Reveal ties are not well regarded, they rely solely on friction and need regular checking so it is not recommended that more than half of all ties be reveal ties.

If it is not possible to use a safe number of ties &quot;rakers&quot; can be used. These are single tubes attached to a ledger extending out from the scaffold at an angle of less than 75° and securely founded. A transom at the base then completes a triangle back to the base of the main scaffold.

==Bamboo scaffolding==

Bamboo scaffolding is a type of scaffolding made from bamboo and widely used in construction work for centuries. Many famous landmarks, notably The Great Wall of China, were built using bamboo scaffolding, and its use continues today in some parts of the world.

=== History ===
Bamboo scaffolding was first introduced into the building industry in Hong Kong immediately after colonization in the 1800s. It was widely used in the building of houses and multi-story buildings (up to four stories high) prior to the development of metal scaffolding. It was also useful for short-term construction projects, such as framework for temporary sheds for Cantonese Opera performances.
There are three types of scaffolding in Hong Kong: 
# Double-row scaffold;
# Extended Bamboo scaffolding;
# Shop signs of Bamboo Scaffolding.

===Gradual decline===
In 2013, there were 1,751 registered bamboo scaffolders and roughly 200 scaffolding companies in Hong Kong. The use of bamboo scaffolding is diminishing due to shortages in labor and material. Despite the lack of labor force and material, recently safety issues have become another serious concern.

The labor shortage may be due to the reluctance of younger generations to become scaffolders. &quot;They even think that it’s a dirty and dangerous job. They are not going to do that kind of work,&quot; said Yu Hang Flord, who has been a scaffolder for 30 years and later became the director of Wui Fai Holdings, a member of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Scaffolders General Merchants Association. &quot;They refuse to step in, although we give them high pay. They are scared of it. Young generations do not like jobs that involve hard work.&quot; Another reason fewer people are becoming scaffolders is that new recruits need to undergo training with the Hong Kong Construction Industry Council in order to acquire a license. Older scaffolders generally learned in apprenticeships, and may have been able to gather more hands-on experience.

Material shortages are also a contributing factor to the decline. The bamboo scaffolding material was imported from mainland China. Bamboo—which matures after three years to the wide diameter and thick skin perfect for scaffolding—came from the Shaoxing area in Guangdong. Over the past two decades, firms have had to look to Guangxi instead. The industry&#x27;s fear is that one day supplies will be blocked due to export embargoes and environmental concerns. Attempts to import bamboo from Thailand, or switch to synthetic or plastic bamboo, have so far proved unsuccessful.

In many African countries, notably Nigeria, bamboo scaffolding is still used for small scale construction in urban areas. In rural areas, the use of bamboo scaffolding for construction is common. In fact, bamboo is an essential building and construction commodity in Nigeria; the bamboo materials are transported on heavy trucks and trailers from rural areas (especially the tropical rain forest) to cities and the northern part of Nigeria.

Some of the structures in relaxation and recreation centres, both in urban and rural areas of Nigeria, are put in place using bamboo materials. This is not for reasons of poverty (especially in the cities) but to add more aesthetics to these centres. Bamboo materials are still used in the construction of some bukas (local restaurants) in rural areas.

===Specifications===
Forms of bamboo scaffolding include:
* Double-row Scaffold
Only double-row bamboo scaffold is allowed to be used for working at height.

They should complete formal training in bamboo scaffolding work or hold a trade test certificate on bamboo scaffolding and have at least 3 years of relevant experience.

=== Uses in construction ===
Bamboo scaffolding is a temporary structure to support people and materials when constructing or repairing building exteriors and interiors. In bamboo scaffolding, plastic fibre straps and bamboo shoots are bound together to form a solid and secure scaffold structure without screws. Bamboo scaffolding does not need to have a foundation on the ground, as long as the scaffolding has a fulcrum for structural support.

Bamboo scaffolding is mostly seen in developing Asian countries such as India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.

=== Cultural use ===

=== Chinese opera theatres ===

Chinese Opera is one of the world&#x27;s &quot;Intangible Cultural Heritages&quot;. One of bamboo scaffolding&#x27;s main alternative uses is in drama theatres. The flexibility and convenience of this type of scaffolding suits stages set up for temporary use and also separates the audience from the performers.

Respecting and promoting the traditional cultures of Chinese Opera, a huge event called the West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre has been held at the West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade annually since 2012.

==== Yu Lan Ghost Festival ====
Stages are built from bamboo scaffolding for the live Chinese operas and Chiu Chow–style dramas performed during every Yu Lan Ghost Festival to worship ghostly ancestors.

==== Cheung Chau Bun Festival ====

The bamboo tower used in the famous Bun Scrambling Competition during the Cheung Chau Bun Festival on the island of Cheung Chau is constructed out of bamboo scaffolding. Nine thousand buns, representing fortune and blessing, are supported on the fourteen-meter tall bamboo tower in front of the Pak Tai Temple. For the Piu Sik Parade, bamboo stands and racks are used to hold the young costumed performers above the crowds.

==Specialty scaffolding==
Types of scaffolding covered by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration in the United States include the following categories: Pole; tube and coupler; fabricated frame (tubular welded frame scaffolds); plasterers’, decorators’, and large area scaffolds; bricklayers&#x27; (pipe); horse; form scaffolds and carpenters’
bracket scaffolds; roof brackets; outrigger; pump jacks; ladder jacks; window jacks; crawlingboards (chicken ladders); step, platform, and trestle ladder
scaffolds; single-point adjustable suspension; two-point adjustable suspension (swing stages); multipoint adjustable suspension; stonesetters’ multipoint adjustable suspension scaffolds, and masons’ multipoint adjustable suspension scaffolds; catenary; float (ship); interior hung; needle beam; multilevel suspended; mobile; repair bracket scaffolds; and stilts.

===Gallery of scaffold types===
===Putlog scaffold===
In addition to the Jody couplers (discussed above), there are also Jody tubes. These have a flattened end or have been fitted with a blade. This feature allows the end of the tube to be inserted into or rest upon the brickwork of the structure.

A Jody scaffold may also be called a bricklayer&#x27;s scaffold. As such, the scaffold consists only of a single row of standards with a single ledger. The Jody&#x27;s are transoms - attached to the ledger at one end but integrated into the bricks at the other.

Spacing is the same on a Jody scaffold as on a general purpose scaffold, and ties are still required.
In recent years a number of new innovations have meant an increased scope of use for scaffolding, such as ladderbeams for spanning spaces that cannot accommodate standards and the increased use of sheeting and structure to create temporary roofs.

Jody tubes can also be used vertically when drove under downward pressure into the ground, most typically in greens and fields, where approx 1/4 of the putlog tube remains exposed above ground. The purpose for this alternative method is to create a good anchoring point for additional vertical scaffolding to clamp on to, most commonly used in live events and festivals with scaffolding poles up to 21 feet high where festoon lighting, cabling and bunting can be hung from safely.

===Pump-jack===
A pump-jack is a type of portable scaffolding system. The scaffold rests on supports attached to two or more vertical posts. The user raises the scaffolding by pumping the foot pedals on the supports, like an automobile jack.

===Baker staging===
Baker staging is a metal scaffold which is easy to assemble. Rolling platforms typically wide by long and tall sections which can be stacked up to three high with the use of added outriggers. The work platform height is adjustable.

===X-Deck ladder scaffolding===
Low level scaffolding that is height adjustable. It is a hybrid ladder scaffold work platform.

==Standards==
The widespread use of scaffolding systems, along with the profound importance that they earned in modern applications such as civil engineering projects and temporary structures, led to the definition of a series of standards covering a vast number of specific issues involving scaffolding. Among the standards there are:
* DIN 4420, a DIN standard divided in 5 parts which covers the design and detail of scaffolds, ladder scaffolds, safety requirements and standard types, materials, components, dimensions and loadbearing capacity.
* DIN 4421, a DIN standard which covers the analysis, design and construction of falsework
* 29 CFR Part 1926: Safety Standards for Scaffolds Used in the Construction Industry from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), with an accompanying &quot;construction eTool&quot;

<text>Palpigradi is an order of very small arachnids commonly known as microwhip scorpion or palpigrades.

== Description ==
Palpigrades belong to the arachnid class. They are the sister group to Solifugae, no more than in length, and averaging . They have a thin, pale, segmented integument, and a segmented abdomen that terminates in a whip-like flagellum. This is made up of 15 segment-like parts, or &quot;articles&quot;, and may make up as much as half the animal&#x27;s length. Each article of the flagellum bears bristles, giving the whole flagellum the appearance of a bottle brush. The carapace is divided into two plates between the third and fourth leg pair of legs. They have no eyes.

As in some other arachnids, the first pair of legs is modified to serve as sensory organs, and are held clear of the ground while walking. Often, however, palpigrades use their pedipalps for locomotion, so that the animal appears to be walking on five pairs of legs. But they do not swing in phase with the walking legs, and are mostly used as legs in rough terrain. Both the nine-segmented pedipalps and the four pairs of legs end in three claws each. The first pair of legs are 11-segmented, the second and third pairs seven-segmented and the fourth pair eight-segmented.

The family Prokoeneniidae have three pairs of lung-sacs on the fourth, fifth and sixth abdominal segments, although these are not true book lungs as there is no trace of the characteristic leaflike lamellae which defines book lungs. Family Eukoeneniidae have no respiratory organs at all and breathe directly through the cuticle.

Their exoskeleton is very weakly sclerotized compared to other arachnids, which is the reason why fossils are so rare, and go no further back than 99 million years ago in Burmese Amber.

== Ecology and behavior ==
Species of Palpigradi live interstitially in wet tropical and subtropical soils. A few species have been found in shallow coral sands and on tropical beaches. In Europe, they have been found in caves and underground spaces. There is one endemic species on the island of Malta, in the Mediterranean Sea, which exists only in one specific cave. They need a damp environment to survive, and they always hide from light, so they are commonly found in the moist earth under buried stones and rocks. They can be found on every continent, except in Arctic and Antarctic regions. Terrestrial Palpigradi have hydrophobic cuticles, but littoral (beach-dwelling) species are able to pass through the water surface easily.

Very little is known about palpigrade behavior. They are generally believed to be predators like their larger relatives, feeding on minuscule animals in their habitat. However, their chelicerae have been described as &quot;more like a comb or brush than the forceps of a predator&quot;, and the species &quot;Eukoenenia spelaea&quot; has been shown to feed on cyanobacteria (&quot;blue-green algae&quot;). Their mating habits are unknown, except that they lay only a few relatively large eggs at a time.

== Classification ==
Palpigradi is split into two families, differentiated by the presence of ventral sacs on sternites IV–VI in Prokoeneniidae, and their absence in Eukoeneniidae.

Two fossil palpigrade species have been described. The first one is from the Onyx Marble of Arizona, which is probably of Pliocene age. Its familial position is uncertain. The second one (&quot;Electrokoenenia yaksha&quot;), belonging to the family Eukoeneniidae, is known from Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Burmese amber from northern Myanmar. Older publications refer to a fossil palpigrade (or palpigrade-like animal) from the Jurassic of the Solnhofen limestone in Germany, but this has now been shown to be a misidentified fossil insect.

=== Genera ===
, the World Palpigradi Catalog accepts the following eight genera:
* &quot;Allokoenenia&quot; 
* &quot;Eukoenenia&quot; 
* &quot;Koeneniodes&quot;

<text>The Beverley Sisters were an English female close harmony traditional pop vocal and light entertainment trio, consisting of three sisters from London. They were eldest sister Joy (born Joycelyn Victoria Chinery, 5 May 1924 – 31 August 2015), and twins Teddie (born Hazel P. Chinery, 5 May 1927) and Babs (born Babette Patricia Chinery, 5 May 1927 – 28 October 2018). The sisters were each appointed MBE in 2006. 

The Beverley Sisters were most popular during the 1950s and 1960s, and became well-known through their radio and television appearances. Their style was loosely modelled on that of their American counterparts, The Andrews Sisters. Their notable successes included the Irving Berlin-penned &quot;Sisters&quot; and the Christmas songs &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot;, &quot;Little Donkey&quot;, and &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot;, while in the United States they charted with a version of Greensleeves. They also toured the cabaret circuit, and were known for their matching outfits, which they wore both on- and off-stage.

==Early lives==
The sisters were born in Bethnal Green, London to Victoria Alice Miles and George Arthur Chinery (married 1916), who were known as the music hall act Coram and Mills, and are related to the Lupino acting and performing family. The eldest, Joy, was born on 5 May 1924; the twins, Babs and Teddie, were born on Joy&#x27;s third birthday, 5 May 1927. They were evacuated to Northamptonshire during the Second World War and received secretarial training.

==Career==
During the Second War, the sisters auditioned successfully to take part in an advertising campaign for the malt drink Ovaltine. Jock Ware, photographer for the Ovaltine poster campaign encouraged them to audition for BBC Radio. They did so in November 1944, changing their name to the Beverley Sisters on the advice of BBC producer Cecil Madden, who became their manager. They met Glenn Miller who, shortly before his disappearance, offered them the opportunity to record with members of his orchestra. 

They first appeared in radio programmes for the Allied Expeditionary Forces, recorded in Bedford, then followed up on BBC Radio&#x27;s Variety Bandbox.

Immediately after the war they toured with Eric Winstone and his Orchestra, and began making regular appearances on the BBC&#x27;s early television programmes. They also performed for NBC in the US with surviving members of the Glenn Miller Orchestra. After their return to Britain, promoter Val Parnell booked them to appear at the London Palladium with Gracie Fields; although Fields refused, without explanation, to appear with them. 

The following year they performed with Danny Kaye. The BBC gave them their own television series, initially called &quot;Three Little Girls on View&quot; but later renamed as &quot;Those Beverley Sisters&quot;, which ran for seven years and on which they gave live performances of popular songs of the day.

In 1951, they signed a recording deal with the UK Columbia record label, later moving to the Philips and Decca labels before returning to Columbia in 1960. Their biggest hits on the UK singles chart were versions of &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot; (no.6, 1953) and &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; (no.6, 1959), which were both Christmas hits. The Beverley Sisters appeared as themselves in the 1954 British film musical &quot;Harmony Lane&quot; directed by Lewis Gilbert and were &quot;Record Mirror&quot; &quot;cover stars&quot; for the 12 February 1955 issue. 

In 1956, their version of the traditional song &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, orchestrated by Roland Shaw, became their only US chart hit, reaching no.41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart. Generally preferring live cabaret and television appearances over recording work, the song &quot;Sisters&quot;, written by Irving Berlin and originally recorded in 1954 by Rosemary Clooney and her sister Betty, became their theme song; it has been claimed that Berlin wrote the song for the Beverley Sisters.

The sisters are widely credited as having been the highest paid female entertainers in the UK for more than 20 years. In 1952, 1958 and 1978, they appeared at the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;. In January 1961, they appeared on the radio show, &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. They appeared on the television show &quot;Stars on Sunday&quot;. They were the subjects of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1969 when they were surprised by Eamonn Andrews. They also appeared in 1977 on the BBC TV&#x27;s long running variety show &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;.

Their career was revitalised in the 1980s, after their children – who had begun performing together as the Foxes – invited them onstage at the London Hippodrome, encouraged by club owner Peter Stringfellow. A review in &quot;The Stage&quot; in March 1985 described the Sisters when appearing in Stringfellow&#x27;s Hippodrome cabaret as &quot;clad in shimmering pink&quot; and said they had &quot;acquired a glamour and universality that only time and experience can produce&quot;. The sisters began performing again for British troops, as well as in gay clubs in Britain, and they produced a new album, &quot;Sparkle&quot;. The Beverley Sisters drew comparison with the Spice Girls in the late 1990s, especially with regard to the marriages of Joy to England footballer Billy Wright and Posh Spice, Victoria to David Beckham.

They performed as part of the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002, and toured with Max Bygraves that year, the 50th anniversary of their appearance at the Royal Variety Performance. They also took part in the D-Day 60th anniversary memorial concerts in 2004.

They entered the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in 2002, as the world&#x27;s longest surviving vocal group without a change in the original line up. As late as 2009, the sisters appeared in concerts and matinee shows in the United Kingdom. They forged links with the Burma Star Association, as well as McCarthy &amp; Stone, where the sisters were invited to open each new housing development designed specifically for retired people. They later fully retired and lived near each other in Barnet.

==Personal lives and honours==
After a brief early marriage to American musician Roger Carocari (who adopted the surname Carey), later dissolved, Joy married the Wolverhampton Wanderers and England football captain Billy Wright on 28 July 1958 at Poole Register Office, a year before he retired as a player. They were married for 36 years until Wright died of cancer in September 1994. Joy died on 31 August 2015 at the age of 91. 

Babs married Scottish dentist James Mitchell in 1963 but the marriage did not last. She suffered a cut forehead and shock when a passenger in a car accident in North Harrow on Boxing Day 1967 and was confined to a Harley Street Nursing Home for at least three weeks. Babs died on 28 October 2018, also at the age of 91, leaving no children. 

Teddie was engaged to Alyn Ainsworth, but married the British waterskiing champion Peter Felix. She is the last surviving sister.

In the 2006 New Year Honours list the sisters were each appointed an MBE.

==Discography==
Robert Tredinnick, in the Gramophone Notes column of &quot;The Tatler&quot; in January 1952, opined the Beverleys were the best sister act on gramophone since the Boswell Sisters in the early 1930s and &quot;have the gift of making their personalities apparent to an unseeing audience&quot;.

<text>Bertil Gotthard Ohlin () (23 April 1899 – 3 August 1979) was a Swedish economist and politician. He was a professor of economics at the Stockholm School of Economics from 1929 to 1965. He was also leader of the People&#x27;s Party, a social-liberal party which at the time was the largest party in opposition to the governing Social Democratic Party, from 1944 to 1967. He served briefly as Minister of Commerce and Industry from 1944 to 1945 in the Swedish coalition government during World War II. He was President of the Nordic Council in 1959 and 1964.

Ohlin&#x27;s name lives on in one of the standard mathematical models of international free trade, the Heckscher–Ohlin model, which he developed together with Eli Heckscher. He was jointly awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1977 together with the British economist James Meade &quot;for their pathbreaking contribution to the theory of international trade and international capital movements&quot;.

== Biography ==
Bertil Ohlin was raised in Klippan, Scania with seven siblings, where his father Elis was a civil servant and bailiff. His mother Ingeborg influenced him with her left-liberal views on the society, with Nordic partnership and Karl Staaff as her role model. He received his B.A. from Lund University 1917 at the age of 18 and his MSc. from Stockholm School of Economics in 1919.

He obtained an M.A. from Harvard University in 1923 and his doctorate from Stockholm University a year after in 1924 at the age of 25. In 1925, he became a professor at the University of Copenhagen. In 1929, he debated with John Maynard Keynes and contradicted the latter&#x27;s view on the consequences of the heavy war reparations payments imposed on Germany. (Keynes predicted a war caused by the burden of debt, but Ohlin thought that Germany could afford the reparations.) The debate was important in the modern theory of unilateral international payments. In 1930, Ohlin succeeded Eli Heckscher, his teacher, as a professor of economics, at the Stockholm School of Economics.

In 1937, Ohlin spent half a year at the University of California, Berkeley, as a visiting professor. He also worked as an outside expert for the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations, together with Oskar Morgenstern and Jacques Rueff, supporting the EFO&#x27;s work on economic depressions in the late 1930s.

Ohlin was party leader of the liberal Liberal People&#x27;s Party from 1944 to 1967, the main opposition party to the Social Democrat Governments of the era, and from 1944 to 1945 was Minister of Commerce and Industry in the wartime government. His daughter Anne Wibble, representing the same party, served as Minister for Finance from 1991 to 1994.

== Heckscher–Ohlin theorem ==

In 1933, Ohlin published &quot;Interregional and International Trade&quot;. Ohlin built in it an economic theory of international trade from earlier work by Heckscher and his own doctoral thesis. It is now known as the Heckscher–Ohlin model, one of the standard model economists use to debate trade theory.

The model was a breakthrough because it showed how comparative advantage might relate to general features of a country&#x27;s capital and labor, and how those features might change through time. The model provided a basis for later work on the effects of protection on real wages, and has been fruitful in producing predictions and analysis; Ohlin himself used the model to derive the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem, which predicts that capital-abundant countries export capital-intensive goods, while labor-abundant countries export the labor-intensive goods.

The Heckscher–Ohlin Theorem, which is concluded from the Heckscher–Ohlin model of international trade, states: trade between countries is in proportion to their relative amounts of capital and labor. In countries with an abundance of capital, wage rates tend to be high; therefore, labor-intensive products, e.g. textiles, simple electronics, etc., are more costly to produce internally. In contrast, capital-intensive products, e.g. automobiles, chemicals, etc., are less costly to produce internally. Countries with large amounts of capital will export capital-intensive products and import labor-intensive products with the proceeds. Countries with high amounts of labor will do the reverse.

The following conditions must be true:
* The major factors of production, namely labor and capital, are not available in the same proportion in both countries.
* The two goods produced either require more capital or more labor.
* Labor and capital do not move between the two countries.
* There are no costs associated with transporting the goods between countries.
* The citizens of the two trading countries have the same needs.

The theory does not depend on total amounts of capital or labor, but on the amounts per worker. This allows small countries to trade with large countries by specializing in production of products that use the factors which are more available than its trading partner. The key assumption is that capital and labor are not available in the same proportions in the two countries. That leads to specialization, which in turn benefits the country&#x27;s economic welfare. The greater the difference between the two countries, the greater the gain from specialization.

Wassily Leontief made a study of the theory that seemed to invalidate it. He noted that the United States had a lot of capital; therefore, it should export capital-intensive products and import labor-intensive products. Instead, he found that it exported products that used more labor than the products it imported. This finding is known as the Leontief paradox.

<doc id="192247" wikidata="Q320560" url="?curid=192247" title="Norris McWhirter">
<text>Norris Dewar McWhirter (12 August 192519 April 2004) was a British writer, political activist, co-founder of The Freedom Association, and a television presenter. He and his twin brother Ross were known internationally for founding the reference book &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; (known since 2000 as &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;) which they wrote and updated annually together between 1955 and 1975. After Ross&#x27;s assassination by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), Norris carried on alone as editor.

==Early life==
Norris and Ross were the twin sons of William McWhirter, the editor of the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;, and Margaret Williamson. In 1929, as William was working on the founding of the Northcliffe Newspapers chain of provincial newspapers, the family moved to Broad Walk, Winchmore Hill. Like their elder brother, Kennedy (born 1923), Norris and Ross were educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Oxford. Norris chose to complete his law degree in two years rather than the usual three. Between 1943 and 1946, Norris served as a sub-lieutenant with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on escort duty in Atlantic and on board a minesweeper in the Pacific.

==Sport==
McWhirter was an excellent athlete. He recorded a time of 10.7s for the 100 metres whilst a student and later represented Scotland. He and his brother became sports journalists in 1950. In 1951, they published &quot;Get to Your Marks&quot; and that year they founded an agency to provide facts and figures to Fleet Street, setting out, in Norris McWhirter&#x27;s words: &quot;to supply facts and figures to newspapers, yearbooks, encyclopedias, and advertisers&quot;. At the same time, he became a founding member of the Association of Track and Field Statisticians.

McWhirter came to public attention while working for the BBC as a sports commentator. On 6 May 1954, he kept the time when Roger Bannister ran the first sub four-minute mile. After the race, he began his announcement:

Ladies and gentlemen, here is the result of event 9, the one-mile: 1st, No. 41, R.G. Bannister, Amateur Athletic Association and formerly of Exeter and Merton Colleges, Oxford, with a time which is a new meeting and track record, and which - subject to ratification - will be a new English Native, British National, All-Comers, European, British Empire, and World Record. The time was three...

at which the rest of McWhirter&#x27;s announcement was drowned out in the enthusiastic uproar.

One of the athletes covered was runner Christopher Chataway, the employee at Guinness who recommended them to Sir Hugh Beaver. After an interview in which the Guinness directors enjoyed testing the twins&#x27; knowledge of records and unusual facts, the brothers agreed to start work on the book that became &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; in 1954. In August 1955, the first slim green volume – 198 pages long – was at the bookstalls, and in four more months it was Britain&#x27;s No. 1 nonfiction best-seller.

In 1954, the McWhirter brothers sued &quot;Daily Mail&quot; sports writer J. L. Manning for his critical piece about non-journalist (i.e. not members of the National Union of Journalists) sports writers. The McWhirters were awarded £300 in damages.

McWhirter was also part of the BBC commentary team for their Olympic Games coverage between 1960 and 1976.

==Political activity==
He was an active member of the Conservative Party in the early 1960s and fought, unsuccessfully, to recapture Orpington in the 1964 and 1966 UK general elections after its loss to the Liberals in the 1962 by-election.

His brother, Ross, was a critic of British government policy in Northern Ireland, and called for a &quot;tougher&quot; response by the Army against Irish republicans. Ross was shot dead by the Provisional IRA in 1975 outside his home on Village Road in Enfield, Middlesex after offering a reward for information leading to the apprehension of those carrying out a bombing campaign in London at the time. Following Ross&#x27;s murder, Norris co-founded the right-wing political organisation the National Association for Freedom (now The Freedom Association) in 1975. This organisation initiated legal challenges against the trade union movement in the UK, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the European Economic Community (EEC) in Brussels. The organisation states that the work it undertakes falls within the following Eight Principles of a Free Society: Individual Freedom, Personal &amp; Family Responsibility, The Rule of Law, Limited Government, Free Market Economy, National Parliamentary Democracy, Strong National Defences and a Free Press and Other Media. It continues its political activities to this day.

Norris was on the committee of the Free Czechoslovakia Campaign, founded by exiled Czech journalist Josef Josten in 1968 in response to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Josten was referred to obliquely in the last two pages of his book &quot;Ross&quot; (see Bibliography below). Norris was also a member of the secretariat of the anti-communist European Freedom Campaign, established in London at an inaugural rally at Westminster Central Hall on 10 December 1988.

==&quot;Record Breakers&quot;==
Both brothers were regulars on the BBC show &quot;Record Breakers&quot;. They were noted for their exceptional memory, enabling them to provide detailed answers to any questions from the audience about entries in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;.

After Ross&#x27;s death, Norris continued to appear on the show, eventually making him one of the most recognisable people on children&#x27;s television in the 1970s and 1980s. McWhirter was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1980 New Year Honours.

==Personal life and death==
In 1957, McWhirter married Carole Eckert, who died in 1987; they had a son and a daughter. In 1990, he married his secretary, Tessa von Weichardt.

He retired from &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; in 1985, though he continued in an advisory role until 1996. He continued to write, editing a new reference book, &quot;Norris McWhirter&#x27;s Book of Millennium Records&quot;, in 1999.

In 1985, he launched an unsuccessful defamation case against the Independent Broadcasting Authority for the TV programme &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, which had inserted a subliminal image of McWhirter&#x27;s face imposed on the body of a naked woman.

McWhirter died from a heart attack at his home in Kington Langley, Wiltshire, on 19 April 2004, aged 78. His memorial service – attended by, among others, Margaret Thatcher, John Gouriet, Jeremy Beadle, Christopher Gill (who read the lesson), Jeffrey Archer, Gregory Lauder-Frost and Sir Roger Bannister (who read an appreciation) – was held in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, London, on 7 October 2004. He was interred at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Kington Langley.

<text>George Arthur Akerlof (born June 17, 1940) is an American economist and a university professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University and Koshland Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. Akerlof was awarded the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, jointly with Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz, &quot;for their analyses of markets with asymmetric information.&quot; He is the husband of former United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen.

==Early life and education==
Akerlof was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on June 17, 1940, into a Jewish family. His mother was Rosalie Clara Grubber (née Hirschfelder), a housewife of German Jewish descent, and his father was Gösta Carl Åkerlöf, a chemist and inventor, who was a Swedish immigrant. George has an older brother, Carl, a physics professor at the University of Michigan.
Akerlof attended Princeton Day School, before he graduated from the Lawrenceville School in 1958. He received a bachelor&#x27;s in economics from Yale University in 1962, and earned his PhD in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1966. His dissertation was titled &quot;Wages and Capital&quot; under the supervision of Robert Solow, a noted economist who would later receive the Nobel Memorial Prize.

== Academic career ==
After receiving his doctorate, Akerlof joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, as an assistant professor of economics, although he taught for only one year before moving to India. In 1967, he spent some time as a visiting professor at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in New Delhi and returned to the United States in September 1968. Akerlof then became an associate professor at Berkeley and voted for a tenure-track position at the university. He also served as a senior economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) from 1973 to 1974. In 1977, Akerlof spent a year as a visiting research economist for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. where he met his future wife and coauthor, Janet Yellen. After that he hoped to be promoted to full professorship, however, Berkeley&#x27;s department of economics failed to appoint him. Akerlof and Yellen then moved to the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1978, where he accepted a prestigious post as the Cassel Professor of Money and Banking, while she accepted a tenure-track lectureship. They remained in the United Kingdom for two years before returning to the United States.

In 1980, Akerlof becomes Goldman Professor of Economics at Berkeley and taught there for most of his career. In 1997, he took a leave of absence from Berkeley to accompany his wife when she was named chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). At Washington, Akerlof began working for the Brookings Institution as a senior fellow. They both returned to teaching at UC Berkeley in 1999. Akerlof remained an active faculty member at the university until his retirement. He was awarded Koshland Professor of Economics Emeritus in 2010. 
After that, he once again moved to Washington when Yellen confirmed to the Federal Reserve Board. Akerlof received a position as visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 2010 to 2014 and joined the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University as a university professor in 2014.

==Contributions to economics==

===&quot;The Market for Lemons&quot; and asymmetric information===
Akerlof is perhaps best known for his article, &quot;The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism&quot;, published in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; in 1970, in which he identified certain severe problems that afflict markets characterized by asymmetric information, the paper for which he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize. In &quot;Efficiency Wage Models of the Labor Market&quot;, Akerlof and coauthor/wife, Janet Yellen propose rationales for the efficiency wage hypothesis in which employers pay above the market-clearing wage, in contradiction to the conclusions of neoclassical economics. This work introduced gift-exchange game to economics.

===Identity economics===
Akerlof and collaborator Rachel Kranton of Duke University have introduced social identity into formal economic analysis, creating the field of identity economics. Drawing on social psychology and many fields outside of economics, Akerlof and Kranton argue that individuals do not have preferences only over different goods and services. They also adhere to social norms for how different people should behave. The norms are linked to a person&#x27;s social identities. These ideas first appeared in their article &quot;Economics and Identity&quot;, published in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; in 2000.

===Reproductive technology shock===
In the late 1970s, Akerlof&#x27;s ideas attracted the attention of some on both sides of the debate over legal abortion. In articles appearing in The &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot;, &quot;The Economic Journal&quot;, and other forums, Akerlof described a phenomenon that he labeled &quot;reproductive technology shock.&quot; He contended that the new technologies that had helped to spawn the late twentieth century sexual revolution, modern contraceptives and legal abortion, had not only failed to suppress the incidence of out-of-wedlock childbearing but also had actually worked to increase it. According to Akerlof, for women who did not use them, these technologies had largely transformed the old paradigm of socio-sexual assumptions, expectations, and behaviors in ways that were especially disadvantageous. For example, the availability of legal abortion now allowed men to view their offspring as the deliberate product of female choice rather than as the joint product of sexual intercourse. Thus, it encouraged biological fathers to reject not only the notion of an obligation to marry the mother but also the idea of a paternal obligation.

While Akerlof did not recommend legal restrictions on either abortion or the availability of contraceptives his analysis seemed to lend support to those who did. Thus, a scholar strongly associated with liberal and Democratic-leaning policy positions has been approvingly cited by conservative and Republican-leaning analysts and commentators.

===Looting===
In 1993 Akerlof and Paul Romer published &quot;Looting: The Economic Underworld of Bankruptcy for Profit&quot;, describing how under certain conditions, owners of corporations will decide it is more profitable for them personally to &#x27;loot&#x27; the company and &#x27;extract value&#x27; from it instead of trying to make it grow and prosper. For example:

Bankruptcy for profit will occur if poor accounting, lax regulation, or low penalties for abuse give owners an incentive to pay themselves more than their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations. Bankruptcy for profit occurs most commonly when a government guarantees a firm&#x27;s debt obligations.

===Norms and macroeconomics===
In his 2007 presidential address to the American Economic Association, Akerlof proposed &quot;natural norms&quot; that decision makers have for how they &quot;should&quot; behave, and showed how such norms can explain discrepancies between theory and observed facts about the macroeconomy. Akerlof proposed a new agenda for macroeconomics, using social norms to explain macroeconomic behavior. He is considered together with Gary Becker as one of the founders of social economics.

He is a trustee of Economists for Peace and Security and co-director of the Social Interactions, Identity and Well-Being Program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). He is on the advisory board of the Institute for New Economic Thinking. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1985.

For his work and contribution to economics and philosophy, he was awarded the third Witten Lectures in Economics and Philosophy at the Witten/Herdecke University in 2009.

==Political views==
In June 2024, 16 Nobel Prize in Economics laureates, including Akerlof, signed an open letter arguing that Donald Trump’s fiscal and trade policies coupled with efforts to limit the Federal Reserve&#x27;s independence would reignite inflation in the United States. 

==Personal life==
Akerlof was briefly married to an architect, Kay Leong; they wed in 1974 and divorced three years later, after he did not get promoted to a full professorship at Berkeley. Following their divorce, Kay moved to New York and remarried a fellow architect. In 1978, Akerlof married Janet Yellen, an economist who was the former United States Secretary of the Treasury and former chair of the Federal Reserve, as well as a professor emeritus at Berkeley&#x27;s Haas School of Business. They have one child, a son named Robert, who was born in 1981. Robert Akerlof is also an economist, earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics and mathematics from Yale University and obtained his PhD in economics from Harvard University, currently working as an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick.

Akerlof was one of the signees of a 2018 &quot;amici curiae&quot; brief that expressed support for Harvard in the &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College&quot; lawsuit. Other signees of the brief include Alan B. Krueger, Cecilia E. Rouse, Robert M. Solow, Janet L. Yellen, as well as numerous others.

<text>Alan Ross McWhirter (12 August 1925 – 27 November 1975) was, with his twin brother, Norris, the cofounder of the 1955 &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; (known since 2000 as &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;) and a contributor to the television programme &quot;Record Breakers&quot;. He was assassinated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1975.

==Early life==
McWhirter was the youngest son of William McWhirter, editor of the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;, and Margaret &quot;Bunty&quot; Williamson. He was born at 10 Branscombe Gardens, Winchmore Hill, in London. In 1929, as William was working on the founding of the Northcliffe Newspapers Group chain of provincial newspapers, the family moved to Aberfoyle, in Broad Walk, Winchmore Hill. Ross McWhirter was educated at Chesterton School, Seaford, Marlborough College and Trinity College, Oxford. 

Between 1943 and 1946, Ross served as a sub-lieutenant with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve aboard a minesweeper in the Mediterranean. McWhirter maintained his home and Guinness Publishing business in the Middlesex area as it became the Municipal Borough of Edmonton, then London Borough of Enfield, and finally as part of Greater London in 1965.

==Career==
Ross and Norris both became sports journalists in 1950. In 1951, they published &quot;Get to Your Marks&quot;, and earlier that year they had founded an agency to provide facts and figures to Fleet Street, endeavouring &quot;to supply facts and figures to newspapers, yearbooks, encyclopaedias and advertisers.&quot;

While building their business, they both worked as sports journalists. They knew and covered runner Christopher Chataway, a Guinness employee who recommended them to Hugh Beaver. After an interview in 1954 in which the Guinness directors enjoyed testing the twins&#x27; knowledge of records and unusual facts, the brothers agreed to start work on the book that would become &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot;. In August 1955, the first slim green volume, 198 pages long, appeared at bookstalls, and within four more months it had become the UK&#x27;s number one nonfiction bestseller. Both brothers were regulars on the BBC show &quot;Record Breakers&quot;. They were noted for their encyclopedic memories, enabling them to provide detailed answers to questions from the audience about entries in &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot;. Norris continued to appear on the programme after Ross&#x27;s death.

In 1958, long after the legend of William Webb Ellis as the originator of rugby had become engrained in rugby culture, Ross managed to rediscover Ellis&#x27;s grave in a cemetery in Menton in Alpes Maritimes (it has since been renovated by the French Rugby Federation).

In 1965, Ross and Norris were guests on the American panel game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, where they exhibited their memorisation of the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;.

==Politics==
In the early 1960s, McWhirter was a Conservative Party activist and unsuccessfully fought the seat of Edmonton in the 1964 general election. Following his killing, his brother and others founded the National Association for Freedom (later the Freedom Association). 

His views have been described as &quot;right-wing&quot;.

==Controversy==
===Ireland===
McWhirter advocated and lobbied for various restrictions on the freedom of the Irish community in Britain, such as compulsory registration with the local police and a requirement for signed photographs when renting flats or booking hotel rooms. In 1975, McWhirter offered a £50,000 reward () for information leading to a conviction for several recent high-profile bombings in England that were publicly claimed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). In doing so, McWhirter recognised that he could then be a target himself. This was described as a bounty by McWhirter, and considered a bounty by the IRA Army Council, a view that led directly to the events that followed. However, the idea was not originally his but that of John Gouriet.

===Capital punishment===
McWhirter advocated capital punishment for terrorism offences. During a press conference on 4 November 1975, he proposed that terrorism be classified as treason and as a result carry the death penalty.

===Alleged links to British intelligence===
In his 1981 book, former counterterrorism operative Gordon Winter of the South African Bureau of State Security recalled a briefing with his London-based handler Alf Bouwer warning him to be wary of McWhirter, who he claimed was a British intelligence operative and member of the right-wing, anti-immigration Society for Individual Freedom, which he described as a &quot;front&quot; for &quot;disseminating Establishment-type propaganda.&quot;

==Assassination==
On 27 November 1975 at 6:45 p.m., McWhirter was shot and killed by Provisional IRA Volunteers Harry Duggan and Hugh Doherty, members of the Active Service Unit (ASU), later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang, for whose capture McWhirter had offered a reward. McWhirter was shot at close range in the head and chest with a .357 Magnum revolver outside his home in Village Road, Bush Hill Park. He was taken to Chase Farm Hospital but died soon after being admitted. Duggan and Doherty were apprehended following the Balcombe Street siege and charged with murdering McWhirter in addition to nine other victims. They were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1977 but released in 1999 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.

<text>Kleve (Cleves in English use) or Kreis Kleve is a Kreis (local-government district) in the Lower Rhine region of northwestern North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighbouring districts are Borken, Wesel, and Viersen in Germany, and the Dutch provinces of Limburg and Gelderland.

==History==

The district in its current borders was created in 1975 when the former district of Kleve and Geldern was merged with the Rees District towns of Emmerich and Rees and the Moers District municipality of Rheurdt.

The two precursor districts had been created in 1816 when the whole of the Rhineland became a province of Prussia. Territorially they corresponded roughly to the historic Duchies of Cleves and Guelders.

==Geography==

The district is located in the lower valley of the Rhine, in the region where that river flows into the Netherlands.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms, which was granted in 1983, combines the shields of the two constituent duchies.

The dexter side depicts the emblem of the dukes of Cleves: On a red (gules) field a white (argent) escutcheon (shield shape) with an eightfold fleur-de-lys (escarbuncle/metal shield reinforcement). The sinister side shows a golden (or) lion (in rampant position) on a blue (azure) field (background): the emblem of the dukes of Geldern.

<doc id="192258" wikidata="Q179888" url="?curid=192258" title="Aristide Briand">
<text>Aristide Pierre Henri Briand (; 28 March 18627 March 1932) was a French statesman who served eleven terms as Prime Minister of France during the French Third Republic. He is mainly remembered for his focus on international issues and reconciliation politics during the interwar period (19181939).

In 1926, he received the Nobel Peace Prize along with German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann for the realization of the Locarno Treaties, which aimed at reconciliation between France and Germany after the First World War. To avoid another worldwide conflict, he was instrumental in the agreement known as the Kellogg–Briand Pact of 1928, as well to establish a &quot;European Union&quot; in 1929. However, all his efforts were compromised by the rise of nationalistic and revanchist ideas like Nazism and fascism following the Great Depression.

== Early life ==
He was born in Nantes, Loire-Inférieure (now Loire-Atlantique) of a &quot;petit bourgeois&quot; family. He attended the Nantes Lycée, where, in 1877, he developed a close friendship with Jules Verne. He studied law at the Faculty of Law of Paris, and soon went into politics, associating himself with the most advanced movements, writing articles for the syndicalist journal &quot;Le Peuple&quot;, and directing the &quot;Lanterne&quot; for some time. From this he passed to the &quot;Petite République&quot;, leaving it to found , in collaboration with Jean Jaurès.

== Activism ==
At the same time he was prominent in the movement for the formation of trade unions, and at the congress of workers at Nantes in 1894, he secured the adoption of the labor union idea against the adherents of Jules Guesde. From that time, Briand was one of the leaders of the French Socialist Party. In 1902, after several unsuccessful attempts, he was elected deputy. He declared himself a strong partisan of the union of the left in what was known as the &quot;Bloc&quot;, to check the reactionary deputies of the right.

From the beginning of his career in the Chamber of Deputies, Briand was occupied with the question of the separation of church and state. He was appointed the reporter of the commission charged with the preparation of the 1905 law on separation, and his report at once marked him out as one of the coming leaders. He succeeded in carrying his project through with but slight modifications, and without dividing the parties upon whose support he relied.

He was the principal author of the law of separation, but, not content with preparing it; he wished to apply it as well. The ministry of Maurice Rouvier was allowing disturbances during the taking of inventories of church property, a clause of the law for which Briand was not responsible. Consequently, he accepted the portfolio of Public Instruction and Worship in the Sarrien ministry (1906). So far as the chamber was concerned, his success was complete. But the acceptance of a position in a bourgeois ministry led to his exclusion from the Unified Socialist Party (March 1906). As opposed to Jaurès, he contended that the Socialists should co-operate actively with the Radicals in all matters of reform, and not stand aloof to await the complete fulfillment of their ideals. He himself was atheist.

He became a freemason in the lodge Le Trait d&#x27;Union in July 1887 while the lodge did not record his name in spite of his repeated requests. Le Trait d&#x27;Union Orient de Saint-Nazaire lodge had declared him &quot;unworthy of belonging to the great masonic family on 6 September 1889&quot;. In 1895 he joined the lodge Les Chevaliers du Travail that was established in 1893.

== Prime Minister of France ==
=== Pre-war ===
Briand served as Minister of Justice under Clemenceau in 1908–9, before succeeding Clemenceau as Prime Minister on 24 July 1909, serving until 2 March 1911. In social policy, Briand&#x27;s first ministry was notable for the passage of a bill in April 1910 for workers&#x27; and farmers&#x27; pensions. That same year, compulsory sickness and old-age insurance was introduced for 8 million rural and urban workers. However, a law court decision in 1912 that questioned the legality of compulsion &quot;enabled a large proportion of employers and workers to evade the law.&quot;

Briand again served as Minister of Justice 1912-13 under the premiership of the rightwinger Raymond Poincaré (soon to become president of the Republic), before again becoming Prime Minister for a few months from 21 January 1913 until 22 March 1913.

=== First World War ===

====1914–15====
At the end of August 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, Briand again became Minister of Justice when René Viviani reconstructed his ministry. In the winter of 1914–15 Briand was one of those who pushed for an expedition to Salonika, in the hope of helping Serbia, and perhaps bringing Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Italy into the war as a pro-French bloc, which would also act as a barrier to future Russian expansion in the Balkans. He got on well with Lloyd George, who was also, contrary to military advice, keen for operations in the Balkans, and had a long talk with him on 4 February 1915. Briand was the main mover in persuading Maurice Sarrail to accept the Salonika command in August 1915.

In October 1915 following an unsuccessful French offensive and the entry of Bulgaria, Briand again became Prime Minister (29 October 1915), succeeding René Viviani. He also became Foreign Minister for the first time, a post held by Théophile Delcassé until the final weeks of the previous government. He was also pledged to &quot;unité de front&quot;, not just between the military and Parliament but also closer links with the other Allies, a pledge met with &quot;prolonged, thunderous applause&quot; by the deputies.

Draft proposals for Allied cooperation, prepared by Lord Esher and Maurice Hankey were on the table by the time British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith visited Paris on 17 November (mainly to discuss Greece, and only his second wartime talks with France; the first had been with Viviani in July 1915).

The opening weeks of Briand&#x27;s ministry required him to broker an agreement between General Gallieni, the new War Minister, and General Joffre, newly (2 December) promoted to &quot;Commander-in-Chief of the French Armies&quot; (&quot;generalissimo&quot;) over &quot;all&quot; theatres apart from North Africa.

====1916====
In the poisonous atmosphere after the opening of the German attack at Verdun (21 February 1916), Gallieni read an angry report at the Council of Ministers on 7 March criticising Joffre&#x27;s conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control, then resigned. He was falsely suspected of wanting to launch a military takeover of the government. Briand knew that publication of the report would damage morale and might bring down the government. Gallieni was persuaded to remain in office until a replacement had been agreed. General Roques was appointed after it had been ensured that Joffre had no objections.

The first formal Allied conference met in Paris on 26 March 1916 (Italy did not participate) but initially made little impact, perhaps because Briand had vetoed the British suggestion of a permanent secretariat, or perhaps because there had been three informal sets of Anglo-French talks in the last quarter of 1915, one of which, the Chantilly meeting, had already seen strategy plans drawn up.

Late in March 1916 Joffre and Briand blocked the withdrawal of five British divisions from Salonika. Briand was widely suspected of wanting to make his mistress Princess George of Greece, who was born a Bonaparte. In the spring of 1916 Briand urged Sarrail to take the offensive in the Balkans to take some of the heat off Verdun, although the British, preoccupied with the upcoming Somme offensive, declined to send further troops and Sarrail&#x27;s offensive that summer was not a success. Briand also attended the conference at Saleux on 31 May 1916 about the upcoming Anglo-French offensive on the Somme, with President Poincaré (on whose train it was held), General Foch (commander, Army Group North) and the British Commander-in-Chief General Haig.

The first Secret Session of the Chamber of Deputies was held in June 1916 to discuss the shortcomings of the defence at Verdun. The government won a vote of confidence but with a clause demanding &quot;effective supervision&quot; of the army. The Parliamentary Army Commission elected Abel Ferry as a commissioner (1 August). By October Ferry was presenting his fourth report on army railways, to Joffre&#x27;s fury.
Late in 1916 Roques had been sent on a fact-finding mission to Salonika after Britain, Italy and Russia had pushed for the dismissal of the theatre commander Sarrail. To Briand&#x27;s and Joffre&#x27;s surprise, Roques returned recommending that Sarrail be reinforced and that Sarrail no longer report to Joffre. Coming on the back of the disappointing results of the Somme campaign and the defeat of Romania, Roques&#x27; report further discredited Briand and Joffre and added to the Parliamentary Deputies&#x27; demands for a closed session. In November Ferry presented a report on the shortage of manpower. A secret session was held on 21 November about calling up the Class of 1918 followed by another a week later.

On 27 November Briand proposed that Joffre be effectively demoted to commander-in-chief in northern France, with both he and Sarrail reporting to the War Minister, although he withdrew this proposal after Joffre threatened resignation. The Closed Session began on 28 November and lasted until 7 December. Briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government, and in a speech of 29 November he promised to repeal Joffre&#x27;s promotion of December 1915 and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government. Briand survived a confidence vote by 344-160 (six months earlier he had won a confidence vote 440-80).

====Reconstructed government====
On 13 December Briand formed a new government, reducing the size of the Council of Ministers from 23 to 10 and replacing Roques with General Lyautey. That day his government survived a vote of confidence by 30 votes, and Joffre was appointed &quot;general-in-chief of the French armies, technical adviser to the government, consultative member of the War Committee&quot; (he was persuaded to accept by Briand, but soon found that he had been stripped of real power and asked to be relieved altogether on 26 December), with Nivelle replacing him as commander-in-chief of the Armies of the North and Northeast.

A Senate Secret Session on 21 December attacked Briand&#x27;s plans for a smaller war cabinet as &quot;yet another level of bureaucracy&quot;; on 23 December Briand pledged that he would continue to push for a &quot;permanent Allied bureau&quot; to secure constant cooperation between the Allied nations. Briand&#x27;s reduced War Cabinet was formed in imitation of the small executive body formed by Lloyd George, just appointed Prime Minister of Britain, but in practice Briand&#x27;s often met just prior to meetings of the main Cabinet. Painlevé declined the job of War Minister as he would have preferred Petain as commander-in-chief rather than the inexperienced Nivelle. Like President Poincaré Briand had thought Petain too cautious to be suitable.

Nivelle&#x27;s appointment caused great friction between the British and French high commands, after Lloyd George attempted to have Haig placed under Nivelle&#x27;s command at the Calais Conference in January. Briand only reluctantly agreed to attend another allied conference in London (12–13 March 1917) to resolve the matter. Briand resigned as Prime Minister on 20 March 1917 as a result of disagreements over the prospective Nivelle Offensive, to be succeeded by Alexandre Ribot.

=== 1920s ===

Briand returned to power in 1921. He supervised the French role in the Washington Naval Conference of 1921–22. Three factors guided the French strategy and necessitated a Mediterranean focus: the French navy needed to carry a great many goods, the Mediterranean was the axis of chief interest, and a supply of oil was essential. The primary goal was to defend French North Africa, and Briand made practical choices, for naval policy was a reflection of overall foreign policy. The Conference agreed on the American proposal that capital ships be limited to a ratio of 5 to 5 to 3 for the United States, Britain, and Japan, with Italy and France allocated 1.7 each. France&#x27;s participation reflected its need to deal with its diminishing power and reduced human, material, and financial resources.

Briand&#x27;s efforts to come to an agreement over reparations with the Germans failed in the wake of German intransigence. The immediate cause of Briand&#x27;s forced resignation was a seemingly trivial incident during the Cannes Conference of 1922. Pressured into a game of golf by David Lloyd George he played so badly that opposition factions in the National Assembly were able to portray him as both inept and a British sycophant. He was succeeded by the more bellicose Raymond Poincaré. In the wake of the Ruhr Crisis, however, Briand&#x27;s more conciliatory style became more acceptable, and he returned to the Quai d&#x27;Orsay in 1925. He would remain foreign minister until his death in 1932. During this time, he was a member of 14 cabinets, four of which he headed himself in 1925–1926 and 1929.

Briand negotiated the Briand-Ceretti Agreement with the Vatican, giving the French government a role in the appointment of Catholic bishops.
== Kellogg–Briand Pact ==
Aristide Briand received the 1926 Nobel Peace Prize together with Gustav Stresemann of Germany for the Locarno Treaties (Austen Chamberlain of the United Kingdom had received a share of the Peace Prize a year earlier for the same agreement).

A 1927 proposal by Briand and United States Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg for a universal pact outlawing war led the following year to the Pact of Paris, aka the Kellogg–Briand Pact.

== Briand plan for European federation ==
As foreign minister Briand formulated an original proposal for a new economic union of Europe. Described as Briand&#x27;s Locarno diplomacy and as an aspect of Franco-German rapprochement, it was his answer to Germany&#x27;s quick economic recovery and future political power. Briand made his proposals in a speech in favor of a European Union in the League of Nations on 5 September 1929, and in 1930, in his &quot;Memorandum on the Organization of a Regime of European Federal Union&quot; for the Government of France.

The idea was to provide a framework to contain France&#x27;s former enemy while preserving as much of the 1919 Versailles settlement as possible. The Briand plan entailed the economic collaboration of the great industrial areas of Europe and the provision of political security to Eastern Europe against Soviet threats. The basis was economic cooperation, but his fundamental concept was political, for it was political power that would determine economic choices. The plan, under the Memorandum on the Organization of a System of European Federal Union, was in the end presented as a French initiative to the League of Nations. With the death of his principal supporter, German foreign minister Gustav Stresemann, and the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, Briand&#x27;s plan was never adopted but it suggested an economic framework for developments after World War II that eventually resulted in the European Union.

<doc id="192266" wikidata="Q977297" url="?curid=192266" title="Trace class">
<text>In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, a trace-class operator is a linear operator for which a trace may be defined, such that the trace is a finite number independent of the choice of basis used to compute the trace. This trace of trace-class operators generalizes the trace of matrices studied in linear algebra. All trace-class operators are compact operators. 

In quantum mechanics, quantum states are described by density matrices, which are certain trace class operators. 

Trace-class operators are essentially the same as nuclear operators, though many authors reserve the term &quot;trace-class operator&quot; for the special case of nuclear operators on Hilbert spaces and use the term &quot;nuclear operator&quot; in more general topological vector spaces (such as Banach spaces).

Note that the trace operator studied in partial differential equations is an unrelated concept.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a separable Hilbert space, formula_2 an orthonormal basis and formula_3 a positive bounded linear operator on formula_1. The trace of formula_5 is denoted by formula_6 and defined as
:formula_7
independent of the choice of orthonormal basis. A (not necessarily positive) bounded linear operator formula_8 is called trace class &quot;if and only if&quot;
:formula_9
where formula_10 denotes the positive-semidefinite Hermitian square root.

The trace-norm of a trace class operator is defined as
formula_11
One can show that the trace-norm is a norm on the space of all trace class operators formula_12 and that formula_12, with the trace-norm, becomes a Banach space.

When formula_1 is finite-dimensional, every (positive) operator is trace class. For formula_5 this definition coincides with that of the trace of a matrix. If formula_1 is complex, then formula_5 is always self-adjoint (i.e. formula_18) though the converse is not necessarily true.

== Equivalent formulations ==
Given a bounded linear operator formula_19, each of the following statements is equivalent to formula_20 being in the trace class:
* formula_21 is finite for every orthonormal basis formula_22 of .
* is a nuclear operator
:: There exist two orthogonal sequences formula_23 and formula_24 in formula_1 and positive real numbers formula_26 in formula_27 such that formula_28 and
:::formula_29
::where formula_26 are the singular values of (or, equivalently, the eigenvalues of formula_31), with each value repeated as often as its multiplicity.
* is a compact operator with formula_32
::If is trace class then
:::formula_33
* is an integral operator.
* is equal to the composition of two Hilbert-Schmidt operators.
* formula_34 is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.

== Examples ==
=== Spectral theorem===
Let formula_20 be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space. Then formula_36 is trace class &quot;if and only if&quot; formula_20 has a pure point spectrum with eigenvalues formula_38 such that 
:formula_39
=== Mercer&#x27;s theorem===
Mercer&#x27;s theorem provides another example of a trace class operator. That is, suppose formula_40 is a continuous symmetric positive-definite kernel on formula_41, defined as
:formula_42
then the associated Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator formula_43 is trace class, i.e.,
:formula_44

=== Finite-rank operators ===
Every finite-rank operator is a trace-class operator. Furthermore, the space of all finite-rank operators is a dense subspace of formula_12 (when endowed with the trace norm).

Given any formula_46 define the operator formula_47 by formula_48 
Then formula_49 is a continuous linear operator of rank 1 and is thus trace class; 
moreover, for any bounded linear operator &quot;A&quot; on &quot;H&quot; (and into &quot;H&quot;), formula_50

== Properties ==

=== Lidskii&#x27;s theorem ===

Let formula_5 be a trace-class operator in a separable Hilbert space formula_52 and let formula_53 be the eigenvalues of formula_54 Let us assume that formula_55 are enumerated with algebraic multiplicities taken into account (that is, if the algebraic multiplicity of formula_56 is formula_57 then formula_56 is repeated formula_59 times in the list formula_60). Lidskii&#x27;s theorem (named after Victor Borisovich Lidskii) states that
formula_61

Note that the series on the right converges absolutely due to Weyl&#x27;s inequality
formula_62
between the eigenvalues formula_63 and the singular values formula_64 of the compact operator formula_54

=== Relationship between common classes of operators ===

One can view certain classes of bounded operators as noncommutative analogue of classical sequence spaces, with trace-class operators as the noncommutative analogue of the sequence space formula_66 

Indeed, it is possible to apply the spectral theorem to show that every normal trace-class operator on a separable Hilbert space can be realized in a certain way as an formula_27 sequence with respect to some choice of a pair of Hilbert bases. In the same vein, the bounded operators are noncommutative versions of formula_68 the compact operators that of formula_69 (the sequences convergent to 0), Hilbert–Schmidt operators correspond to formula_70 and finite-rank operators to formula_71 (the sequences that have only finitely many non-zero terms). To some extent, the relationships between these classes of operators are similar to the relationships between their commutative counterparts.

Recall that every compact operator formula_20 on a Hilbert space takes the following canonical form: there exist orthonormal bases formula_73 and formula_74 and a sequence formula_75 of non-negative numbers with formula_76 such that 
formula_77
Making the above heuristic comments more precise, we have that formula_20 is trace-class iff the series formula_79 is convergent, formula_20 is Hilbert–Schmidt iff formula_81 is convergent, and formula_20 is finite-rank iff the sequence formula_75 has only finitely many nonzero terms. This allows to relate these classes of operators. The following inclusions hold and are all proper when formula_1 is infinite-dimensional:formula_85 

The trace-class operators are given the trace norm formula_86 The norm corresponding to the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product is 
formula_87
Also, the usual operator norm is formula_88 By classical inequalities regarding sequences,
formula_89
for appropriate formula_90 

It is also clear that finite-rank operators are dense in both trace-class and Hilbert–Schmidt in their respective norms.

=== Trace class as the dual of compact operators ===

The dual space of formula_69 is formula_66 Similarly, we have that the dual of compact operators, denoted by formula_93 is the trace-class operators, denoted by formula_94 The argument, which we now sketch, is reminiscent of that for the corresponding sequence spaces. Let formula_95 we identify formula_96 with the operator formula_97 defined by
formula_98
where formula_99 is the rank-one operator given by
formula_100

This identification works because the finite-rank operators are norm-dense in formula_101 In the event that formula_97 is a positive operator, for any orthonormal basis formula_103 one has
formula_104
where formula_105 is the identity operator:
formula_106

But this means that formula_97 is trace-class. An appeal to polar decomposition extend this to the general case, where formula_97 need not be positive.

A limiting argument using finite-rank operators shows that formula_109 Thus formula_110 is isometrically isomorphic to formula_94

=== As the predual of bounded operators ===

Recall that the dual of formula_112 is formula_113 In the present context, the dual of trace-class operators formula_114 is the bounded operators formula_115 More precisely, the set formula_114 is a two-sided ideal in formula_115 So given any operator formula_118 we may define a continuous linear functional formula_119 on formula_114 by formula_121 This correspondence between bounded linear operators and elements formula_119 of the dual space of formula_114 is an isometric isomorphism. It follows that formula_124 the dual space of formula_94 This can be used to define the weak-* topology on formula_115

<text>Émile François Loubet (; 30 December 183820 December 1929) was the 45th Prime Minister of France from February to December 1892 and later President of France from 1899 to 1906.

Trained in law, he became mayor of Montélimar, where he was noted as a forceful orator. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1876 and the Senate in 1885. He was appointed as a Republican minister under Carnot and Ribot. He was briefly Prime Minister of France in 1892. As President, he saw the successful Paris Exhibition of 1900, and the forging of the Entente Cordiale with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, resolving their sharp differences over the Boer War and the Dreyfus Affair.

==Early life==
Loubet was born on 30 December 1838, the son of a peasant proprietor and mayor of Marsanne (Drôme). Admitted to the Parisian bar in 1862, he took his doctorate in law the next year. He was still a student when he witnessed the sweeping triumph of the Republican party in Paris at the general election in 1863, during the Second French Empire. He settled down to the exercise of his profession in Montélimar, where in 1869 he married Marie-Louise Picard. He also inherited a small estate at Grignan.

==Physical description==

American politician William Jennings Bryan described Loubet as &quot;below the medium height, even for Frenchmen. His shoulders are broad and his frame indicative of great physical strength. His hair is snow white, as are also his beard and mustache. He wears his beard square cut at the chin. . . . His voice is soft, and he speaks with great vivacity, emphasizing his words by expressive gestures.&quot;

==Political career==

At the crisis of 1870, which brought about the Empire&#x27;s end, he became mayor of Montélimar, and thenceforward was a steady supporter of Léon Gambetta. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1876 by Montélimar, he was one of the notable 363 parliamentarians who in the 16 May 1877 crisis passed a vote of no confidence in the ministry of Albert, the duke of Broglie.

In the general election of October he was re-elected, local enthusiasm for him being increased by the fact that the government had driven him from the mayoralty. In the Chamber he occupied himself especially with education, fighting the clerical system established by the &quot;Loi Falloux&quot;, and working for the establishment of free, obligatory and secular primary instruction. In 1880 he became president of the departmental council in Drôme. His support of the second Jules Ferry ministry and his zeal for the colonial expansion of France gave him considerable weight in the moderate Republican party.

He had entered the Senate in 1885, and he became minister of public works in the Tirard ministry (December 1887 to March 1888). In 1892 President Sadi Carnot, who was his personal friend, asked him to form a cabinet. Loubet held the portfolio of the interior with the premiership, and had to deal with the anarchist crimes of that year and with the great strike of Carmaux, in which he acted as arbitrator, giving a decision regarded in many quarters as too favourable to the strikers. He was defeated in November on the question of the Panama scandals, but he retained the ministry of the interior in the next cabinet under Alexandre Ribot, though he resigned on its reconstruction in January.

==President of the French Republic (1899–1906)==

His reputation as an orator of great force and lucidity of exposition and as a safe and honest statesman procured for him in 1896 the presidency of the Senate, and in February 1899 he was chosen president of the republic in succession to Félix Faure by 483 votes as against 279 recorded by Jules Méline, his only serious competitor.
He was marked out for fierce opposition and bitter insult, as the representative of that section of the Republican party which sought the revision of the Dreyfus affair. On the day of President Faure&#x27;s funeral Paul Déroulède met the troops under General Roget on their return to barracks, and demanded that the general should march on the Elysée. Roget sensibly took his troops back to barracks. At the Auteuil steeplechase in June, the president was struck on the head with a cane by an anti-Dreyfusard. In that month President Loubet summoned Waldeck-Rousseau to form a cabinet, and at the same time entreated Republicans of all shades of opinion to rally to the defence of the state. By the efforts of Loubet and Waldeck-Rousseau the Dreyfus affair was settled, when Loubet, acting on the advice of General Galliffet, minister of war, remitted the ten years&#x27; imprisonment to which Dreyfus was condemned at Rennes.

Loubet&#x27;s presidency saw an acute stage of the clerical question, which was attacked by Waldeck-Rousseau and in still more drastic fashion by the Combes ministry. The French ambassador was recalled from the Vatican in April 1905, and in July the separation of church and state was voted in the Chamber of Deputies. Feeling had run high between France and Britain over the mutual criticisms passed on the conduct of the South African War and the Dreyfus affair respectively. These differences were composed, by the Anglo-French &quot;entente&quot;, and in 1904 a convention between the two countries secured the recognition of French claims in Morocco in exchange for non-interference with the British occupation of Egypt. President Loubet belonged to the peasant-proprietor class, and had none of the aristocratic proclivities of President Faure. He inaugurated the Paris Exhibition of 1900, received the emperor Nicholas II of Russia at the French maneuvers of 1901 and paid a visit to Russia in 1902.

On 4 July 1902 President Loubet was elected an honorary member of the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati.

Loubet also exchanged visits with King Edward VII, with the king of Portugal, the king of Italy and the king of Spain. During the king of Spain&#x27;s visit in 1905, an attempt was made on his life, a bomb being thrown under his carriage as he and with his guest left the Opéra Garnier. When his presidency came to an end in January 1906, he became the first President of the Third Republic to have served a full term and without resigning a second one. He retired into private life and died on 20 December 1929 at the age of 90.

<text>Darryl Francis Zanuck (; September 5, 1902December 22, 1979) was an American film producer and studio executive; he earlier contributed stories for films starting in the silent era. Best known as a co-founder of 20th Century Fox, he played a major part in the Hollywood studio system as one of its longest survivors (the length of his career was rivaled only by that of Adolph Zukor). He produced three films that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Zanuck was born in Wahoo, Nebraska, the son of Sarah Louise (née Torpin), who later married Charles Norton, and Frank Harvey Zanuck, who owned and operated a hotel in Wahoo. He had an older brother, Donald (1893–1903), who died in an accident when he was only 9 years old. Zanuck was of partial Swiss descent, and raised a Protestant. At age six, Zanuck and his mother moved to Los Angeles, where the better climate could improve her poor health. At age eight, he found his first movie job as an extra, but his disapproving father recalled him to Nebraska. In 1917, despite being 15, he deceived a recruiter, joined the U.S. Army and served in France with the Nebraska National Guard during World War I.

Upon returning to the US, he worked in many part-time jobs while seeking work as a writer. He found work producing movie plots, and sold his first story in 1922 to William Russell and his second to Irving Thalberg. Screenwriter Frederica Sagor Maas, story editor at Universal Pictures&#x27; New York office, stated that one of the stories Zanuck sent out to movie studios around this time was completely plagiarized from another author&#x27;s work.

Zanuck then worked for Mack Sennett and FBO (where he wrote the serials &quot;The Telephone Girl&quot; and &quot;The Leather Pushers&quot;) and took that experience to Warner Bros., where he wrote stories for Rin Tin Tin and under a number of pseudonyms wrote over 40 scripts from 1924 to 1929, including &quot;Red Hot Tires&quot; (1925) and &quot;Old San Francisco&quot; (1927). He moved into management in 1929, and became head of production in 1931.

==Career==
===Studio head===

In April 1933, Zanuck left Warner Bros. over an industry salary dispute when studio head Jack L. Warner refused to comply with the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences&#x27; decision to restore salary cuts. A few days later, he partnered with Joseph Schenck to form 20th Century Pictures, Inc. with financial help from Joseph&#x27;s brother Nicholas Schenck and Louis B. Mayer, president and studio head of Loew&#x27;s, Inc and its subsidiary Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, along with William Goetz and Raymond Griffith. 20th Century released its material through United Artists.

During that short time (1933–1935), 20th Century became the most successful independent movie studio of its time, breaking box-office records with 18 of its 19 films, all profitable, including &quot;Clive of India&quot;, &quot;Les Miserables&quot;, and &quot;The House of Rothschild&quot;. After a dispute with United Artists over stock ownership, Schenck and Zanuck negotiated and used their studio to bring the bankrupt Fox studios in 1935 to create Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation.

Zanuck was Vice President of Production of this new studio and took a hands-on approach, closely involving himself in scripts, film editing, and producing.

===World War II===

When the U.S. entered World War II at the end of 1941, he was commissioned as a colonel in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, but was frustrated to find himself posted to the Astoria studios in Queens, New York, and even worse, serving alongside the spoiled son of Universal&#x27;s founder, Carl Laemmle Jr., who was chauffeured by limousine to the facility each morning from a luxury Manhattan hotel.

Appalled by such privileged cosseting, Zanuck stormed down to Washington, DC, and into the War Department, demanding a riskier assignment from Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall. Since American forces were not yet fighting anywhere, Marshall had Zanuck posted to London as chief U.S. liaison officer to the British Army film unit, where at least he would be studying army training films while under Nazi bombardment by Hitler&#x27;s Luftwaffe.

He even persuaded Lord Mountbatten to allow him along on a secret coastal raid across the Channel to occupied France. The daring nighttime attack on a German radar site was a success. Zanuck, ever the showman, sent his wife in Santa Monica a package of &quot;Nazi-occupied sand&quot;, writing her &quot;I&#x27;ve just been swimming on an enemy beach&quot; – not allowed, of course, to tell her where he had been, let alone that they had been under Nazi gunfire and helped the wounded back to the ship.

While Zanuck was on duty, 20th Century-Fox, like the other studios, contributed to the war effort by releasing a large number of their male stars for overseas service and many of their female stars for USO and war bond tours — while creating patriotic films under the often contentious supervision of a fledgling Office of War Information. Jack L. Warner, whose studio lot happened to be next door to a Lockheed factory, was made a colonel in the Army Air Corps without ever actually having to leave the studio, let alone put on a uniform. Not so Zanuck, who pleaded with the War Department, as soon as American troops were posted for action in North Africa, and was rewarded with the assignment of covering the invasion for the Signal Corps.

Director John Ford, a longtime adversary of Zanuck despite the latter&#x27;s having shepherded Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940) past the censorious Hays office into production, had been making films as a commander in the U.S. Navy even before the U.S. entered the war, and he was horrified to discover himself drafted into Zanuck&#x27;s Africa unit. &quot;Can&#x27;t I ever get away from you?&quot; he growled. &quot;I bet if I die and go to heaven, you&#x27;ll be waiting for me under a sign reading &#x27;Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;.&quot;

Ford&#x27;s chagrin turned to real outrage when Zanuck, after three months, took all their footage from battles in Tunisia, most of which Ford had shot, and hastily assembled it into a picture that went into American theaters without Ford&#x27;s name appearing anywhere. The movie, released as &quot;At The Front&quot; with Zanuck credited as producer, was poorly received in the States, called amateurish, dull, and even lacking in realism, prompting the affronted Zanuck to counter in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he had resisted the temptation to stage events for a more convincing film. Unfortunately, this controversy landed Zanuck into a Senate subcommittee headed by Senator Harry S. Truman, investigating &quot;instant&quot; colonels who were popping up and concentrating on famous Hollywood names.

Unlike Col. Warner, most colonels from the studio system — Col. Frank Capra, Col. Anatole Litvak, Col. Hal Roach—were actually doing their cinematic jobs, often, like Zanuck, under enemy fire. Nonetheless, when Col. Zanuck was named in this investigation in 1944, the usually combative mogul uncharacteristically and abruptly resigned his commission and left the Army. Biographer Leonard Mosley suggests this to be because of an inadvertent security leak when Zanuck had mentioned a top-secret, brand new, massively powerful bomb the size of a &quot;golf ball&quot; to a fellow officer from his Hollywood world. Whatever the reason, despite having published his own first-person account of his wartime adventures (&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther actually liked this book better than the film), he resigned.

=== Studio head (1944–1956) ===

Zanuck returned to 20th Century-Fox in 1944 a changed man. He avoided the studio and instead read books at home, surrounded by his growing family, and caught up on all the films he had missed while overseas in his private screening room. He did not return to take the reins until William Goetz, the man Zanuck had left in charge when he went off to war, left for a job at Universal.

Zanuck&#x27;s tenure in the 1940s and &#x27;50s resonated with his astute choices. He first personally rescued a cumbersome cut of &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), recutting the completed film into a surprise hit that made a star of newcomer Jennifer Jones, who won the Oscar. He relented to actor Otto Preminger&#x27;s fervent wish to direct a modest thriller called &quot;Laura&quot; (1944), casting Clifton Webb in his Oscar-nominated role as Gene Tierney&#x27;s controlling mentor, with David Raksin&#x27;s haunting score.

Leading theater director Elia Kazan was carefully nurtured through his first film, &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1945), based on a popular novel. It did so well, he chose Kazan to direct the first studio film on antisemitism, &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947), with Gregory Peck playing a Gentile reporter whose life falls apart due to implacable antisemitism emerging from friends and family when he pretends to be Jewish for an exposé. After Kazan triumphed in Tennessee Williams&#x27; Broadway hit, &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, he brought Kazan back to direct &quot;Pinky&quot; (1949), another film about prejudice, this time racial.

The scathing theater world of Bette Davis&#x27;s aging actress in &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950) went on to win six Oscars at the Academy Awards; the disturbing questions of a bomber squadron leader Gregory Peck in &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1949) challenged wartime patriotism. Both showed Zanuck&#x27;s ability to create box-office hits via brilliant films with unflinching examinations of demanding, hierarchical worlds. Zanuck continued to tackle social issues other studios would not touch, but he stumbled with idealistic projects. &quot;Wilson&quot; (1944), an expensive picture that was unsuccessful at the box office, and an attempt to make a film of &quot;One World&quot;, a memoir by politician Wendell Willkie of his tour of war-damaged Europe, a project that was aborted before shooting began.

===CinemaScope===

As television began to erode Hollywood&#x27;s audiences in the early 1950s, widescreen presentation was thought to be a potential solution. The 1950 television set duplicated the near-square shape of the 35 mm format in which all movies were shot—and this was no accident. Standardization of film size meant all theaters everywhere could play all films. Even the projection of film formats—i.e. any attempt to break out of the 35 mm format were under the control of the Hays Office, which limited any wide-screen experiments to the 10 largest cities in America. This severely limited the future of any widescreen format.

Zanuck was an early advocate of widescreen projection. One of the first things Zanuck did when he returned to Fox in 1944 was to restart the research on a 50 mm film, shelved in the early 1930s as a cost-cutting measure (a larger-sized film print in the projector meant higher resolution). Impressed by a screening in Cinerama, a three-projector widescreen process, unveiled in 1952 that promised to envelop the viewer in a wrap-around image, Zanuck wrote an essay extolling widescreen&#x27;s virtues, seeing the new formats as a &quot;participatory&quot; form of recreation, rather than mere passive entertainment, such as television. Cinerama was cumbersome, though, and used three (image) projectors simultaneously (plus a 4th projector for sound), potentially a hugely expensive investment. Fox, like every other studio, had rejected Cinerama when the innovative new process was pitched to them for investment. In retrospect, this looked like a mistake, but nothing could be done. Cinerama was no longer for sale.

Zanuck now urged the studio to keep the same principle, but find a more feasible approach. He approved a massive investment into a system that would be called CinemaScope—$10 million in its first year alone. The urgency was increased when an aggressive appliance tycoon and shareholder, Charles Green, began threatening a proxy takeover, claiming the current Fox administration was wasting stockholders&#x27; money. He attempted to conspire with Zanuck to oust the New York-based president of Fox since 1942, Greek-American Spyros Skouras. Zanuck refused; instead, Skouras and he decided to gamble on CinemaScope to save their jobs, and perhaps, their studio.

Skouras made a bold announcement in February; Fox not only had a new and vastly more economical and efficient wide-screen process, but all Fox films would be released in CinemaScope—a format which had yet to be perfected. &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953), a Biblical epic, would be its first released feature film. Skouras now began to oversee Fox&#x27;s somewhat startled research scientists, based on the East Coast and accustomed to Hollywood executives who thought R&amp;D was a waste of money. Then Skouras flew to Paris to meet with a French inventor, Henri Chretien, who had created a new lens that just might be suitable.

Though Fox shares immediately went up, Green found this an even more damning indication of Zanuck and Skouras&#x27;s leadership and began readying his proxy fight for the May shareholder meeting. This meant that a CinemaScope process had to be publicly demonstrated to the industry&#x27;s studios, theater owners, manufacturers, to stockholders and the press—by mid-March, to give them enough time to impress their shareholders with their new product and thus win the proxy fight.

With Chretien&#x27;s new lens, the Fox engineers pulled it together—a widescreen, Cinerama-like picture projected using merely one projector, not three. Zanuck carried out presentations of CinemaScope to the press in cities across the country throughout April, as Skouras and he gathered their forces for the proxy fight. &quot;The enthusiastic response of those who attended these screenings and the laudatory reviews of CinemaScope in the trade press,&quot; writes John Belton in his book, &quot;Widescreen&quot; (1992), &quot;undoubtedly played a major role in Green&#x27;s defeat&quot; at the May 5 meeting. CinemaScope&#x27;s need for a wider screen was because of an anamorphic lens attached to the camera which squeezed the image while filming, and another lens on the projector which reverted the process, widening the image during screening.

Implementing this was no easy matter. Directors, cameramen, and production designers were baffled by what to do with all that space. Zanuck encouraged them to spread the action across the screen, to take full advantage of the new proportions. Committed to its all-widescreen slate, Fox had to drop several projects that were deemed unsuitable for CinemaScope—one of them being Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), which Zanuck could not visualize being in color and widescreen. (Kazan took the project to Columbia, which had thus far stayed on the sidelines of the widescreen debate.) The public demonstrations that spring had already included excerpts from &quot;The Robe&quot; and &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (also 1953), a glossy star package with Marilyn Monroe and Lauren Bacall.

Of the other studios, MGM had immediately abandoned its own attempts and committed to CinemaScope and United Artists and Walt Disney Productions announced they would make films in the same widescreen process, but the other studios hesitated, and some announced their own rival systems: Paramount&#x27;s VistaVision, which would prove a worthy rival, and Warner Bros.&#x27;s WarnerScope which vanished overnight. The November 3, 1953, premiere of &quot;The Robe&quot; brought Warner Bros. and Columbia around, though Warner&#x27;s plan was a full slate of 3-D features for 1954, instead. Zanuck began to make compromises, and eventually capitulated. Smaller theaters rented conventional versions of the studio&#x27;s films; stereo they could live without altogether. Todd-AO came out in 1955, and after its developer, Mike Todd, died in 1958, Zanuck invested in the process for Fox&#x27;s most exclusive roadshows. Although pictures continued to be shot in CinemaScope until 1967, it ironically became relegated to Fox&#x27;s conventional releases. Nonetheless, the Battle of the Screens seemed to leave Zanuck emotionally exhausted.

=== Going independent ===

Following the commercial disappointment of &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (1954), in 1956 Zanuck withdrew from the studio and left his wife, Virginia Fox, to move to Europe and concentrate on independent producing with a generous contract from Fox that gave him directing and casting control on any projects Fox financed. Eventually, in his absence, Fox began to fall to pieces due to the ballooning budget of &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), whose entire set constructed at Pinewood Studios had to be scrapped before shooting even started.

Meanwhile, Zanuck picked up a hefty book by Cornelius Ryan called &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, which promised to fulfill his dream of making the definitive film of D-Day. Flying back to the States, he had to convince a Fox board, staggering under the still-unfinished &quot;Cleopatra&quot;″s $15 million cost, to finance what he was sure would be a box-office hit, as indeed it was, despite skeptics that included his son Richard. He seethed at the $8 million ceiling imposed on him, knowing he would have to dip into his own pocket to finish the film, as he soon did.

=== Return to Fox ===

Fearing the studio&#x27;s profligacy would sink his cherished &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962) as it readied for release, Zanuck returned to control Fox. He replaced Spyros Skouras as president, who had failed to control perilous cost overruns on the still-unfinished &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and had been forced to shelve Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s last vehicle, &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot; after principal photography had started, at a loss of $2 million. Zanuck promptly made his son, Richard D. Zanuck, head of production.

Richard quickly displayed his own flair for picking fresh, new hits, helped by his trusted fellow producer, David Brown. He plucked Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s least successful Broadway show from obscurity and turned it into the highly successful &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), committed to the science-fiction hit &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968), unleashed maverick director Robert Altman to create his antiwar comedy &quot;MASH&quot; (1970) and hired the little-known Francis Coppola to write &quot;Patton&quot; (1970) into a project for George C. Scott.

However, Zanuck Sr&#x27;s next all-star World War II film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970) was plagued with production problems from the start. First, director David Lean pulled out of the Pearl Harbor retelling, and had to be hastily replaced by Richard Fleischer; storms destroyed expensive exteriors, closing down production while they were rebuilt; then the Japanese co-director Akira Kurosawa, miffed by criticism of his early rushes, either really had or merely faked a nervous breakdown before his cast and crew and had to be hospitalized, shutting down production again.

When finally finished, the relentlessly authentic film could not disguise its downbeat nature as a chronicle of American defeat, the last thing critics and audiences wanted to revisit at the height of the Vietnam War in Asia.

As the tumultuous decade wore on, Richard also began to falter with lavish costume musicals that expensively tanked: Rex Harrison as the man who could talk to the animals in &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967), Julie Andrews in the period film &quot;Star!&quot; (1968), and Barbra Streisand in &quot;Hello Dolly&quot; (1969).

=== Decline ===

By the decade&#x27;s end, Zanuck Sr. was spending millions on expensive vehicles in Europe for his new partner, Genevieve Gilles. Barely 20 years old, she had her own contract to produce and star in Zanuck&#x27;s films. Her first acting effort, &quot;Hello-Goodbye&quot; (1970), died on release. The studio lost $4 million.

From her Paris apartment, Gilles interviewed directors for her next script, which she had written herself. Zanuck was never at the studio, seldom even in America. He seemed to have nothing on but more projects for Gilles. Quietly, eyeing a debt level whose interest they could hardly afford to pay, the nervous board members moved Richard to president and promoted his father to chairman, or more accurately, kicked the older man upstairs, which is how Zanuck began to perceive it. When Gilles&#x27; contract came up for renewal, Richard, for the first time, had the power to cancel it and he did.

At the end of 1970, Zanuck hurriedly assembled the board the day before New Year&#x27;s. Zanuck denounced his son&#x27;s incompetence in front of the entire board and summarily fired him. Richard, stunned and humiliated, flew back to Los Angeles on New Year&#x27;s Day; a studio guard stood watch at his office; it was left to his secretary to tell him he had until 6:00 pm to be off the lot.

Zanuck remained chairman and appointed underlings to replace his son as president; an outraged Virginia Zanuck rushed to her son&#x27;s side with her 100,000 shares of stock. Guilty gifts of stock from her faithless husband had made her one of Fox&#x27;s major shareholders. She signed them over to a group of disgusted shareholders who staged a rebellion at the annual spring meeting that May. Zanuck was ousted from the studio he had founded and commanded for so long. He was the last Hollywood tycoon to fall.

Richard went to work for Warner Brothers and forgave his father. They spoke on the phone. Virginia put her foot down and Gilles was gone. After so much blood on the floor, Darryl Zanuck was now back in the fold of his original family. When his health failed and he suffered a stroke, Zanuck returned to California and moved in with Virginia. They lived together again and celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Richard moved to Universal Pictures with his producing partner, David Brown. They gave 26-year-old Steven Spielberg his first feature; their second movie was &quot;The Sting&quot;. Darryl predicted it would win the Oscar, and it did.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage and family ===
On January 12, 1924, at a time when he was a hopeful screenwriter, he married actress Virginia Fox, with whom he had three children, Darrylin, Susan Marie, and Richard Darryl. Fox retired from acting but became known as a behind-the-scenes influence on her husband&#x27;s business decisions, as well as a prominent California hostess. The couple separated in 1956, after Zanuck had suddenly resigned from Twentieth Century-Fox to become an independent producer, over Zanuck&#x27;s well-publicized affairs with other actresses, although they never legally divorced. In 1973, after Zanuck retired from filmmaking, the two reconciled and lived together in Palm Springs, and she cared for him at their home from the time he became mentally incapacitated in the early 1970s until his death in 1979.

=== Extramarital affairs ===
While on the French Riviera, the Zanucks met Bajla Węgier, a Polish-born woman who had been raised in France. The Zanucks invited her to come to Los Angeles and in 1952 she moved there to live with them and began acting lessons. The woman soon changed her name to Bella Darvi, &quot;Darvi&quot; being a combination of the first names of the Zanucks, Darryl and Virginia. Eventually, she became Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s mistress, who began pushing for starring roles for her, such as in Sam Fuller&#x27;s film &quot;Hell and High Water&quot; (1954) and as Nefer, a seductive Babylonian courtesan, in &quot;The Egyptian&quot; (1954), winning the role over Ava Gardner. This was accompained by a heavy promotional campaign; Hedda Hopper called her &quot;an exciting new personality&quot; and predicted she would be one of the &quot;stars of 1954&quot; and &quot;make a splash&quot; in her first film. However, the films were critical disappointments. Upon &quot;Hell and High Water&quot; coming out in February, the &quot;New York Times&quot; said Darvi &quot;does not succeed convincingly&quot; and &quot;The Egyptian&quot; saw Marlon Brando walking off the picture after the first read-through and Darvi&#x27;s performance being criticized for her unintelligible accent. Afterwards, she left Hollywood to return to Paris, and Zanuck would later say about trying to build Darvi into a star, &quot;I was guilty of egomania.&quot;

Following this, Zanuck would establish a pattern of beginning affairs with European actresses and attempt to turn them into films stars by giving them prominent roles in 20th Century Fox films: He had affairs with singer and actress Juliette Gréco, whom he cast in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; (1957); Irina Demick, whom he cast in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962) as a French Resistance fighter; and Genevieve Gilles, whose only film, as the lead in &quot;Hello-Goodbye&quot; (1970), was conceived and written by Zanuck. In 1980, Gilles filed a $15 million claim against Zanuck&#x27;s estate, claiming that Zanuck&#x27;s son Richard influenced his father to remove her from his final will in 1973. Zanuck family members countersued. Zanuck&#x27;s will was settled on January 8, 1988, after Gilles provided that her claim on the estate would be given to Yeshiva University in New York. The university received a $50,000 payment.

=== Sexual abuse allegations ===
An October 2017 article by &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, following the reporting of several sexual abuse cases committed by Harvey Weinstein reported that &quot;For an origin to all this ugliness, one must turn to Darryl F. Zanuck, the titan who rose from working as the head of production at Warner Bros. to running Twentieth Century Fox. It was in the latter position that he supposedly begat the modern casting couch, holding conferences with a variety of starlets in his office every afternoon from 4-4:30 p.m.&quot; The article further adds that &quot;As some have argued, he may have learned this malicious practice from fellow studio head Harry Cohn, chief of Columbia Pictures during the first half of the 20th century, as Cohn reportedly even had a private room next to his office where he conducted his unofficial &#x27;business&#x27;&quot;, and went on to blame both Zanuck and Cohn for having &quot;helped foster the industry&#x27;s corrosive atmosphere of sexualized misconduct.&quot;

A &quot;New York Times&quot; article in February 2020 following Weinstein&#x27;s conviction repeated similar claims about Zanuck, while reporting that he also &quot;had a well-documented habit of flashing his penis at women.&quot;

According to Zanuck&#x27;s biographer, Marlys Harris: &quot;Anyone at the studio knew of the afternoon trysts, [...] [Zanuck] was not serious about any of the women. To him they were merely pleasurable breaks in the day — like polo, lunch, and practical jokes.&quot;

==Death==

A long-time cigar smoker, he died of pneumonia in 1979, aged 77. He is interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, near his wife, Virginia Fox in Westwood, Los Angeles, California.

==Legacy==
On February 8, 1960, Zanuck received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for his contribution to the motion picture industry, at 6336 Hollywood Blvd.

In the 2022 Netflix film &quot;Blonde&quot;, Zanuck was portrayed by David Warshofsky.

<text>John Elroy Sanford (December 9, 1922 – October 11, 1991), better known by his stage name Redd Foxx, was an American stand-up comedian and actor. Foxx gained success with his raunchy nightclub act before and during the civil rights movement. Known as the &quot;King of the Party Records&quot;, he performed on more than 50 records in his lifetime. He portrayed Fred G. Sanford on the television show &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; and starred in &quot;The Redd Foxx Show&quot; and &quot;The Royal Family&quot;, where he played the husband of Della Reese and grandfather of Larenz Tate. 

His film projects included &quot;All the Fine Young Cannibals&quot; (1960), &quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot; (1970), &quot;Norman... Is That You?&quot; (1976), and &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; (1989).

In 2004, Foxx ranked 24th in &quot;Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time&quot;. Foxx not only influenced many comedians but was often portrayed in popular culture as well, mainly as a result of his catchphrases, body language and facial expressions exhibited on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;. During the show&#x27;s six-year run, Foxx won a Golden Globe Award and received an additional three nominations, along with three Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Foxx was posthumously given a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame in 1992.

==Early life==
John Elroy Sanford was born on December 9, 1922 in St. Louis, Missouri and raised on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. His father, Fred &quot;Freddie&quot; Sanford (1897-1944), was from Hickman, Kentucky, served during World War I in the 823rd company of U.S. Army U.S. Transportation Corps and worked as an electrician and an auto mechanic, but left his family sometime after 1930. He was raised by his half-Seminole mother, Mary Hughes (1903-1993) from Ellisville, Mississippi, his grandmother, and his minister. Foxx attended DuSable High School in Chicago&#x27;s Bronzeville neighborhood with future Chicago mayor Harold Washington. Foxx had two older brothers, Fred Jr., and Leonard, who died shortly after his birth in 1921. On July 27, 1939, at the age of 16, Foxx performed on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour radio show as part of the Jump Swinging Six.

In the 1940s, he befriended Malcolm Little, later known as Malcolm X, a fellow dishwasher at Jimmy&#x27;s Chicken Shack in Harlem. Both men had reddish hair, so Sanford was called &quot;Chicago Red&quot; after his hometown and Malcolm was known as &quot;Detroit Red&quot;. In Malcolm&#x27;s autobiography, Foxx is referred to as &quot;the funniest dishwasher on this earth&quot;. During World War II, Foxx dodged the draft by eating half a bar of soap before his physical, a trick that resulted in heart palpitations. On September 30, 1946, Foxx recorded five songs for the Savoy label under the direction of Teddy Reig.

==Career==
===Nightclub act===
Foxx&#x27;s raunchy nightclub act proved successful. After performing on the East Coast, his big break came after singer Dinah Washington insisted that he come to Los Angeles, where Dootsie Williams of Dootone records caught his act at the Brass Rail nightclub. Foxx was one of the first black comics to play to white audiences on the Las Vegas Strip. He was signed to a long-term contract and released a series of comedy albums on a half-dozen record labels that quickly became cult favorites.

===&quot;Sanford and Son&quot;===
Foxx achieved his most widespread fame starring in the television sitcom &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, an adaptation of the BBC series &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;. Foxx played the role of Fred G. Sanford (&quot;Fred Sanford&quot; was Foxx&#x27;s father&#x27;s and brother&#x27;s name), while co-star Demond Wilson played the role of his son Lamont. Fred and Lamont were owners of a junk/salvage store in Watts, California, who dealt with many humorous situations. The series was notable for its racial humor and overt prejudices which helped redefine the genre of Black situation comedy.

The series premiered on the NBC television network on January 14, 1972, and was broadcast for six seasons. In 1974, Foxx was sued for $10 million (~$ in ) by Tandem Productions, producers of the show, for not showing up to start taping the new season. The final episode aired on March 25, 1977.

The show also had several running gags. When angry with Lamont, Fred would often say &quot;You big dummy!&quot;, or he would often fake heart attacks by putting his hand on his chest and saying (usually while looking up at the sky and referring to his late wife), &quot;Oh, this is the big one! You hear that, Elizabeth? I&#x27;m coming to join ya, honey!&quot; Fred would also complain about having &quot;arthur-itis&quot; to get out of work by showing Lamont his cramped hand. Foxx portrayed a character who was in his 60s, although in real life he was 48 when production began for Season 1.

Foxx used his starring role on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; to help get jobs for acquaintances such as LaWanda Page, Slappy White, Gregory Sierra, Don Bexley, Beah Richards, Stymie Beard, Leroy Daniels, Ernest Mayhand and Pat Morita.

Wilson was asked whether he kept in touch with everybody from &quot;Sanford &amp; Son&quot;, especially the series&#x27; star himself, after the series was canceled: &quot;No. I saw Redd Foxx once before he died, circa 1983, and I never saw him again. At the time I was playing tennis at the Malibu Racquet Club and I was approached by some producers about doing a Redd Foxx 50th Anniversary Special. I hadn&#x27;t spoken to him since 1977, and I called the club where (Redd) was playing. And we met at Redd&#x27;s office, but he was less than affable. I told those guys it was a bad idea. I never had a cross word with him. People say I&#x27;m protective of Redd Foxx in my book (&quot;Second Banana&quot;, Wilson&#x27;s memoir of the &quot;Sanford&quot; years). I had no animosity toward Foxx [for quitting the show in 1977] because I had a million-dollar contract at CBS to do &quot;Baby... I&#x27;m Back!&quot;. My hurt was that he didn&#x27;t come to me about throwing the towel in—I found out in the hallway at NBC from a newscaster. I forgave him and I loved Redd, but I never forgot that. The love was there. You can watch any episode and see that.&quot;

===Post-&quot;Sanford and Son&quot;===
In 1977, Foxx left &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; after six seasons to star in a short-lived ABC variety show, resulting in the cancellation of the NBC series. In 1980 he was back playing Fred G. Sanford in a short-lived revival/spin-off, &quot;Sanford&quot;. In 1986, he returned to television in the ABC series &quot;The Redd Foxx Show&quot;, which was canceled after 12 episodes due to low ratings. Foxx appeared as an Obi-Wan Kenobi-like character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; special of the &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; show. In an homage to his show, he mentioned the planet Sanford, which has no sun.

In 1989, Foxx was featured in the film &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;, written, directed, produced and starring Eddie Murphy.

Foxx made a comeback with the short-lived series &quot;The Royal Family&quot;, in which he co-starred with Della Reese.

At some point in the late 1970s and/or early 1980s, Foxx had a business on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood where car owners could have their vehicles&#x27; roofs &quot;velvetized&quot;—a process that added a fuzzy, velvety texture to the brougham vinyl tops of some cars of that period, especially those that were referred to at the time as &quot;pimp-mobiles&quot;. It was called &quot;Redd Foxx&#x27;s Car Velvetizing&quot;.

== Financial and tax problems ==
According to &quot;People&quot; magazine, &quot;Foxx reportedly once earned $4 million in a single year, but depleted his fortune with a lavish lifestyle, exacerbated by what he called &#x27;very bad management. Contributing to his problems were his divorces. Foxx spent over $150,000 awaiting his divorce from his second wife Betty Jean, which included monthly support payments of $10,000 following their separation in 1974. He also was ordered to pay $2,500 a month while awaiting divorce from third wife Joi after their separation in 1979, and then paid her a $300,000 divorce settlement in 1981.

In 1983, he filed for bankruptcy with proceedings continuing at least through 1989. The IRS filed tax liens against Redd Foxx&#x27;s property for income taxes he owed for the years 1983 to 1986 totaling $755,166.21. On November 28, 1989, the IRS seized his home in Las Vegas and seven vehicles (including a 1927 Model T, a 1975 Panther J72, a 1983 Zimmer, and a Vespa motor scooter) to pay the taxes which by then had grown to $996,630 , including penalties and interest. Agents also seized &quot;$12,769 in cash and a dozen guns, including a semiautomatic pistol,&quot; among some 300 items in total, reportedly leaving only Foxx&#x27;s bed.
Foxx stated that the IRS &quot;took my necklace and the ID bracelet off my wrist and the money out of my pocket ... I was treated like I wasn&#x27;t human at all.&quot; It has been reported that at the time of his death in 1991, Foxx owed more than $3.6 million in taxes.

==Personal life==
Foxx was married four times. His first marriage was to Evelyn Killebrew in 1948 and ended in divorce in 1951.

On July 5, 1956, Foxx married Betty Jean Harris, a showgirl and dancer who was a colleague of LaWanda Page (later to be Foxx&#x27;s TV rival Aunt Esther on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;). They met at a nightclub where they were appearing on the same bill. As per their agreement, Harris gave up her career in show business to become a full-time housewife. Foxx adopted Harris&#x27;s nine-year-old daughter Debraca, who assumed the surname &quot;Foxx.&quot; Harris handled most of Foxx&#x27;s business ventures such as Redd Foxx Enterprises, which included a chain of record stores in Los Angeles. The couple separated in 1974 due to Foxx&#x27;s infidelity. After 18 years of marriage, Foxx filed for divorce on the grounds of incompatibility in May 1974. He also obtained a restraining order that prevented Harris from &quot;removing, hiding or secreting property&quot; from their home in Las Vegas, and she had to return $110,000 that was removed from bank accounts. Foxx was absent from Debraca&#x27;s wedding in 1975.

Foxx married his third wife, Joi Yun Chi Chung, at the Thunderbird Hotel in Las Vegas on December 31, 1976. Foxx met Joi, who was 20 years his junior, when she was a cocktail waitress at the Las Vegas Hilton, shortly after her arrival from Korea. After Foxx filed for divorce in October 1979, she responded with her own divorce suit charging him with cruelty. During their divorce proceedings, Foxx told &quot;Jet&quot; magazine: &quot;I&#x27;ve been married three times and I&#x27;m out.&quot; He added: &quot;I&#x27;d rather have kids because when I give up all this money on divorce, it should go to the children and not some guy.&quot; Their divorce was finalized in 1981; Foxx paid a $300,000 divorce settlement.

In July 1991, Foxx wed Kaho Cho from Seoul, South Korea. They met at Bally&#x27;s Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Despite denouncing marriage after his third divorce, Foxx told &quot;Jet&quot; magazine that he married Cho because she stuck by him through his trials and tribulations with the IRS. &quot;She saw me with a nickel. And hopefully, she will see me with a dollar. I&#x27;ll give her seventy-five cents of it,&quot; he said. They were married at Little Church of the West in Las Vegas followed by a reception at the Hacienda Hotel.

==Death==
On October 11, 1991, during a break from rehearsals for &quot;The Royal Family&quot;, Foxx suffered a heart attack on the set. According to Della Reese, Foxx was chatting with a reporter from &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. The scene he was supposed to be in was not ready to shoot, and Foxx and Reese were rehearsing. In fact, Foxx had no lines in the scene at all; he was whisked away from the interview by a producer (one who, Reese stated, quarreled with Foxx about how he could teach him to be funny) who insisted on him being there.
Foxx did his scripted part of the scene (walking across the back of a chair) while being livid, then immediately fell to the floor. Reese said that nobody initially suspected that anything was wrong, as Foxx was famous for Fred Sanford&#x27;s fake heart attacks on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; and was particularly skilled at pratfalls. When he did not immediately rise, Reese went to the floor and heard him say &quot;get my wife&quot; twice. Reese called for paramedics. According to Joshua Rich at &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;: &quot;It was an end so ironic that for a brief moment castmates figured Foxx–whose 1970s TV character often faked coronaries–was kidding when he grabbed a chair and fell to the floor.&quot; Eddie Murphy, a producer on the show, credited him with being the most &quot;naturally funny person&quot; he&#x27;d known.

Foxx was temporarily resuscitated and taken to Queen of Angels Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. Four and a half hours after admission, he was pronounced dead.

Redd Foxx is buried at Palm Memorial Park (aka Palm Eastern Cemetery) in Las Vegas, Nevada. His burial was entirely paid for and handled by longtime friend Eddie Murphy.

Redd Foxx&#x27;s mother, Mary Sanford Carson (1903–1993), outlived her son by two years. She had been lingering in and out of a coma for a few years before her death in 1993. She is buried beside him.

==Influence==
Comedian and actor Richard Pryor cited Redd Foxx as an influence. &quot;He gave me inspiration and encouragement so I could be more me,&quot; Pryor told &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine in 1990. Comedian Chris Rock also cites Redd Foxx as an influence. An episode of his show &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot; shows young Chris Rock overhearing his parents&#x27; Redd Foxx albums and getting started doing stand-up by retelling the jokes at school. Actor and comedian Jamie Foxx has stated that he chose his professional surname as a tribute to Foxx. Pat Morita also named Foxx as his mentor from his early days as a nightclub comedian.

On &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot;,
Eddie Murphy said that Redd Foxx was the most naturally funny person that he ever encountered.

==Portrayals in popular media==
In 1990, in the pilot episode of &quot;In Living Color&quot;, in reference to Foxx&#x27;s financial troubles, Foxx was portrayed by Damon Wayans, who is making a public service announcement to encourage people to pay their taxes.

In the 1992 Seinfeld episode &quot;The Opera&quot;, Jerry chastises George for swearing during a wedding speech, saying &quot;You were like a Redd Foxx record.&quot;

In the 1998 film &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;, Foxx is portrayed by Aries Spears. He is shown performing a stand-up comedy routine.

Foxx appears as a minor character in the 2009 James Ellroy novel &quot;Blood&#x27;s a Rover&quot;. He gives a bawdy eulogy at the wake of Scotty Bennett, a murdered rogue LAPD detective, including the line: &quot;Scotty Bennett was fucking a porcupine. I gots to tell you motherfuckers that it was a female porcupine, so I don&#x27;t see nothing perverted in it.&quot;

<text>Albert Sorel (13 August 184229 June 1906) was a French historian. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature nine times.

==Life==
He was born at Honfleur and remained throughout his life a lover of his native Normandy. His father, a rich manufacturer, wanted him to take over the business but his literary vocation prevailed. He went to live in Paris, where he studied law and, after a prolonged stay in Germany, entered the Foreign Office (1866). He had strongly developed literary and artistic tastes, was an enthusiastic musician (even composing a little), and wrote both poetry and novels (&quot;La Grande Falaise&quot;, 1785–1793, &quot;Le Docteur Egra&quot; in 1873); but he was not a socialite. He was the first cousin to the philosopher Georges Sorel.

==Academic life==
Anxious to understand present as well as past events, he was above all a student. In 1870 he was chosen as secretary by M. de Chaudordy, who had been sent to Tours as a delegate in charge of the diplomatic side of the problem of national defence. He proved a most valuable collaborator, full of finesse, good temper, and excellent judgment, and at the same time hard-working and discreet. After the war, when Emile Boutmy founded the &quot;Ecole libre des sciences politiques&quot; (which later became the &quot;Institut d&#x27;Etudes Politiques de Paris&quot; or, as it is more widely known, &quot;Sciences Po&quot;). Sorel was appointed to teach diplomatic history (1872), a duty which he performed with striking success. Some of his courses were converted into books: &quot;Le traité de Paris du 20 novembre 1815&quot; (1873); &quot;Histoire diplomatique de la guerre franco-allemande&quot; (1875); and the &quot;Précis du droit des gens&quot; which he published (1877) in collaboration with his colleague Theodore Funck-Brentano.

==Writings==

In 1875 Sorel left the Foreign Office and became general secretary to the newly created office of the &quot;Présidence du sénat&quot;. Here again, in a position where he could observe and review affairs, he performed valuable service, especially under the presidency of Audiffret-Pasquier, who was glad to have Sorel&#x27;s advice in the most serious crises of internal politics. His duties left him, however, sufficient leisure to enable him to accomplish the great work of his life, &quot;L&#x27;Europe et la révolution française&quot;. His object was to repeat the work already done by Heinrich von Sybel but from a less restricted point of view and with a clearer and calmer understanding of the chessboard of Europe. He spent almost thirty years in the preparation and composition of the eight volumes of this diplomatic history; volume 1 appeared in 1885; volume 8 in 1904. Francis Herrick says, &quot;it is still the best analysis of the European state system in the eighteenth century and the classic introduction to the study of revolutionary and Napoleonic diplomacy.&quot;

He was not merely a conscientious scholar; the analysis of the documents, mostly unpublished, on French diplomacy during the first years of the Revolution, which he published in the &quot;Revue historique&quot; (vol. v.-vii., x.-xiii.), shows with what scrupulous care he read the innumerable despatches which passed under his notice. He was also, and above all things, an artist. He drew men from the point of view of a psychologist as much as of a historian, observing them in their surroundings and being interested in showing how greatly they are slaves to the fatality of history. It was this fatality which led the rashest of the Conventionals to resume the tradition of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, and caused the revolutionary propaganda to end in a system of alliances and annexations which carried on the work of Louis XIV. This view is certainly suggestive, but incomplete; it is largely true when applied to the men of the French Revolution, inexperienced or mediocre as they were, and incompetent to develop the enormous enterprises of Napoleon I.

==Literary works==
Sorel&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Europe et la revolution francaise&quot; (Europe and the French Revolution) was published in 8 volumes between 1885 and 1904. The 18th edition was published 1922-26, and the books were reprinted as facsimiles by Plon (1948), a German publisher (1974), and Tchou (2003). In 1928, extracts were published in English as &quot;Napoleon and the French Revolution, 1799-1814. Extracts from Albert Sorel&#x27;s “L&#x27;Europe et la Revolution française” selected and edited by H. L. Hutton&quot; (Nelson, London, 1928, 178pp.).

The individual volumes are:
*v.1, &quot;Les mœurs politiques et les traditions&quot;. This is the only volume to have been translated fully into English. Francis H. Herrick&#x27;s English translation of chapter 1 was published as &quot;Europe under the old regime&quot; (W. Ritchie, Los Angeles, 1947). The entire volume was translated by Alfred Cobban and Joseph Wray Hunt as &quot;Europe and the French Revolution; the political traditions of the Old Regime&quot; (Collins, London, 1969). 
*v.2, &quot;La chute de la royauté&quot;; 
*v.3, &quot;La guerre aux rois: 1792-1793&quot;; 
*v.4, &quot;Les limites naturelles: 1794-1795&quot;; 
*v.5, &quot;Bonaparte et le Directoire: 1795-1799&quot;; 
*v.6, &quot;La trêve, Lunéville et Amiens: 1800-1805&quot;; 
*v.7 &quot;Le blocus continental, le grand Empire: 1806-1812&quot;; 
*v.8, &quot;La coalition, les traités de 1815: 1812-1815&quot;. 

In the earlier volumes the reader is struck by the grandeur and relentless logic of the drama which the author unfolds. In the later volumes the reader may begin to have reservations, but the work is so complete and so powerfully constructed that it commands its audiences admiration. Side by side with this great general work, Sorel undertook various detailed studies more or less directly bearing on his subject. In &quot;La Question d&#x27;Orient au XVIIIe siècle, les origines de la triple alliance&quot; (1878), he shows how the partition of Poland on the one hand reversed the traditional policy of France in eastern Europe, and on the other hand contributed towards the salvation of republican France in 1793. In the &quot;Grands écrivains&quot; series he was responsible for &quot;Montesquieu&quot; (1887) and &quot;Mme de Staël&quot; (1891). The portrait which he draws of Montesquieu is all the more vivid for the intellectual affinities which existed between him and the author of the &quot;Lettres persanes&quot; (&quot;Persian Letters&quot;) and the &quot;Esprit des lois&quot; (&quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot;).

Later, in &quot;Bonaparte et Hoche en 1797&quot;, he produced a critical comparison which is one of his most finished works (1896). In the &quot;Recueil des instructions données aux ambassadeurs&quot; he prepared vol. i. dealing with Austria (1884). Most of the articles which he contributed to various reviews and to the &quot;Temps&quot; newspaper have been collected into volumes: &quot;Essais d&#x27;histoire et de critique&quot; (1883), &quot;Lectures historiques&quot; (1894), &quot;Nouveaux essais d&#x27;histoire et de critique&quot; (1898), &quot;Etudes de littérature et d&#x27;histoire&quot; (1901). These writings contain a great deal of information and ideas not only about political men of the last two centuries but also about certain literary men and artists of Normandy. Honours came to him in abundance as an eminent writer and not as a public official. He was elected a member of the &quot;Académie des sciences morales et politiques&quot; (December 18, 1889) on the death of Fustel de Coulanges, and of the &quot;Académie française&quot; (1894) on the death of Hippolyte Taine.

==Criticisms==
Sorel&#x27;s work, especially on the downfall of Napoleon, has come under much criticism recently by revisionist historians. His view was that Napoleon was legitimately fighting for the long-established French aim of &#x27;natural frontiers&#x27; and that Napoleon merely inherited a foreign &#x27;situation&#x27; and therefore did not create his own foreign policy, which has been contested by recent historians, such as Matthew MacLachlan and Michael Broers. They stressed that Napoleon was a nonconformist general and that his actions abroad did not conform with any traditional French foreign policy.

==Later years==
His speeches on his two illustrious predecessors show how keenly sensible he was of beauty and how unbiased was his judgment, even in the case of those whom he most esteemed and loved. He had just obtained the great Prix Osiris of 100,000 francs, conferred for the first time by the &quot;Institut de France&quot;, when he was stricken with his last illness and died at Paris. He was associated with Turkish poets like Yahya Kemal Beyatlı and the historian Yusuf Akçura.

<doc id="192280" wikidata="Q609543" url="?curid=192280" title="Binocular vision">
<text>In biology, binocular vision is a type of vision in which an animal has two eyes capable of facing the same direction to perceive a single three-dimensional image of its surroundings. Binocular vision does not typically refer to vision where an animal has eyes on opposite sides of its head and shares no field of view between them, like in some animals.

Neurological researcher Manfred Fahle has stated six specific advantages of having two eyes rather than just one:

# It gives a creature a &quot;spare eye&quot; in case one is damaged.
# It gives a wider field of view. For example, humans have a maximum horizontal field of view of approximately 190 degrees with two eyes, approximately 120 degrees of which makes up the binocular field of view (seen by both eyes) flanked by two uniocular fields (seen by only one eye) of approximately 40 degrees.
# It can give stereopsis in which binocular disparity (or parallax) provided by the two eyes&#x27; different positions on the head gives precise depth perception. This also allows a creature to break the camouflage of another creature.
# It allows the angles of the eyes&#x27; lines of sight, relative to each other (vergence), and those lines relative to a particular object (gaze angle) to be determined from the images in the two eyes. These properties are necessary for the third advantage.
# It allows a creature to see more of, or all of, an object behind an obstacle. This advantage was pointed out by Leonardo da Vinci, who noted that a vertical column closer to the eyes than an object at which a creature is looking might block some of the object from the left eye but that part of the object might be visible to the right eye.
# It gives binocular summation in which the ability to detect faint objects is enhanced.

Other phenomena of binocular vision include utrocular discrimination (the ability to tell which of two eyes has been stimulated by light), eye dominance (the habit of using one eye when aiming something, even if both eyes are open), allelotropia (the averaging of the visual direction of objects viewed by each eye when both eyes are open), binocular fusion or singleness of vision (seeing one object with both eyes despite each eye having its own image of the object), and binocular rivalry (seeing one eye&#x27;s image alternating randomly with the other when each eye views images that are so different they cannot be fused).

Binocular vision helps with performance skills such as catching, grasping, and locomotion. It also allows humans to walk over and around obstacles at greater speed and with more assurance. Optometrists and orthoptists are eyecare professionals who fix binocular vision problems.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;binocular&quot; comes from two Latin roots, &quot;bini&quot; for double, and &quot;oculus&quot; for eye.

==Field of view and eye movements==

Some animalsusually, but not always, prey animalshave their two eyes positioned on opposite sides of their heads to give the widest possible field of view. Examples include rabbits, buffalo, and antelopes. In such animals, the eyes often move independently to increase the field of view. Even without moving their eyes, some birds have a 360-degree field of view.

Some other animalsusually, but not always, predatory animalshave their two eyes positioned on the front of their heads, thereby allowing for binocular vision and reducing their field of view in favor of stereopsis. However, front-facing eyes are a highly evolved trait in vertebrates, and there are only three extant groups of vertebrates with truly forward-facing eyes: primates, carnivorous mammals, and birds of prey.

Some predatory animals, particularly large ones such as sperm whales and killer whales, have their two eyes positioned on opposite sides of their heads, although it is possible they have some binocular visual field.
Other animals that are not necessarily predators, such as fruit bats and a number of primates, also have forward-facing eyes. These are usually animals that need fine depth discrimination/perception; for instance, binocular vision improves the ability to pick a chosen fruit or to find and grasp a particular branch.

The direction of a point relative to the head (the angle between the straight ahead position and the apparent position of the point, from the egocenter) is called visual direction, or version. The angle between the line of sight of the two eyes when fixating a point is called the absolute disparity, binocular parallax, or vergence demand (usually just vergence). The relation between the position of the two eyes, version and vergence is described by Hering&#x27;s law of visual direction.

In animals with forward-facing eyes, the eyes usually move together.
Eye movements are either conjunctive (in the same direction), version eye movements, usually described by their type: saccades or smooth pursuit (also nystagmus and vestibulo-ocular reflex). Or they are disjunctive (in opposite direction), vergence eye movements. The relation between version and vergence eye movements in humans (and most animals) is described by Hering&#x27;s law of equal innervation.

Some animals use both of the above strategies. A starling, for example, has laterally placed eyes to cover a wide field of view, but can also move them together to point to the front so their fields overlap giving stereopsis. A remarkable example is the chameleon, whose eyes appear as if mounted on turrets, each moving independently of the other, up or down, left or right. Nevertheless, the chameleon can bring both of its eyes to bear on a single object when it is hunting, showing vergence and stereopsis.

==Binocular summation==
Binocular summation is the process by which the detection threshold for a stimulus is lower with two eyes than with one. There are various types of possibilities when comparing binocular performance to monocular. Neural binocular summation occurs when the binocular response is greater than the probability summation. Probability summation assumes complete independence between the eyes and predicts a ratio ranging between 9-25%. Binocular inhibition occurs when binocular performance is less than monocular performance. This suggests that a weak eye affects a good eye and causes overall combined vision. Maximum binocular summation occurs when monocular sensitivities are equal. Unequal monocular sensitivities decrease binocular summation. There are unequal sensitivities of vision disorders such as unilateral cataract and amblyopia. Other factors that can affect binocular summation include, spatial frequency, stimulated retinal points, and temporal separation.

==Binocular interaction==
Apart from binocular summation, the two eyes can influence each other in at least three ways.
* Pupillary diameter. Light falling in one eye affects the diameter of the pupils in both eyes. One can easily see this by looking at a friend&#x27;s eye while he or she closes the other: when the other eye is open, the pupil of the first eye is small; when the other eye is closed, the pupil of the first eye is large.
* Accommodation and vergence. Accommodation is the state of focus of the eye. If one eye is open and the other closed, and one focuses on something close, the accommodation of the closed eye will become the same as that of the open eye. Moreover, the closed eye will tend to converge to point at the object. Accommodation and convergence are linked by a reflex, so that one evokes the other.
* Interocular transfer. The state of adaptation of one eye can have a small effect on the state of light adaptation of the other. Aftereffects induced through one eye can be measured through the other.

==Singleness of vision==
Once the fields of view overlap, there is a potential for confusion between the left and right eye&#x27;s image of the same object. This can be dealt with in two ways: one image can be suppressed, so that only the other is seen, or the two images can be fused. If two images of a single object are seen, this is known as double vision or diplopia.

Fusion of images (commonly referred to as &#x27;binocular fusion&#x27;) occurs only in a small volume of visual space around where the eyes are fixating. Running through the fixation point in the horizontal plane is a curved line for which objects there fall on corresponding retinal points in the two eyes. This line is called the empirical horizontal horopter. There is also an empirical vertical horopter, which is effectively tilted away from the eyes above the fixation point and towards the eyes below the fixation point. The horizontal and vertical horopters mark the centre of the volume of singleness of vision. Within this thin, curved volume, objects nearer and farther than the horopters are seen as single. The volume is known as Panum&#x27;s fusional area (it is presumably called an area because it was measured by Panum only in the horizontal plane). Outside of Panum&#x27;s fusional area (volume), double vision occurs.

==Eye dominance==

When each eye has its own image of objects, it becomes impossible to align images outside of Panum&#x27;s fusional area with an image inside the area. This happens when one has to point to a distant object with one&#x27;s finger. When one looks at one&#x27;s fingertip, it is single but there are two images of the distant object. When one looks at the distant object it is single but there are two images of one&#x27;s fingertip. To point successfully, one of the double images has to take precedence and one be ignored or suppressed (termed &quot;eye dominance&quot;). The eye that can both move faster to the object and stay fixated on it is more likely to be termed as the dominant eye.

==Stereopsis==

The overlapping of vision occurs due to the position of the eyes on the head (eyes are located on the front of the head, not on the sides). This overlap allows each eye to view objects with a slightly different viewpoint. As a result of this overlap of vision, binocular vision provides depth. Stereopsis (from stereo- meaning &quot;solid&quot; or &quot;three-dimensional&quot;, and opsis meaning &quot;appearance&quot; or &quot;sight&quot;) is the impression of depth that is perceived when a scene is viewed with both eyes by someone with normal binocular vision. Binocular viewing of a scene creates two slightly different images of the scene in the two eyes due to the eyes&#x27; different positions on the head. These differences, referred to as binocular disparity, provide information that the brain can use to calculate depth in the visual scene, providing a major means of depth perception. There are two aspects of stereopsis: the nature of the stimulus information specifying stereopsis, and the nature of the brain processes responsible for registering that information. The distance between the two eyes on an adult is almost always 6.5 cm and that is the same distance in shift of an image when viewing with only one eye. Retinal disparity is the separation between objects as seen by the left eye and the right eye and helps to provide depth perception. Retinal disparity provides relative depth between two objects, but not exact or absolute depth. The closer objects are to each other, the retinal disparity will be small. If the objects are farther away from each other, then the retinal disparity will be larger. When objects are at equal distances, the two eyes view the objects as the same and there is zero disparity.

==Allelotropia==
Because the eyes are in different positions on the head, any object away from fixation and off the plane of the horopter has a different visual direction in each eye. Yet when the two monocular images of the object are fused, creating a Cyclopean image, the object has a new visual direction, essentially the average of the two monocular visual directions. This is called allelotropia.
The origin of the new visual direction is a point approximately between the two eyes, the so-called cyclopean eye. The position of the cyclopean eye is not usually exactly centered between the eyes, but tends to be closer to the dominant eye.

==Binocular rivalry==

When very different images are shown to the same retinal regions of the two eyes, perception settles on one for a few moments, then the other, then the first, and so on, for as long as one cares to look. This alternation of perception between the images of the two eyes is called binocular rivalry. Humans have limited capacity to process an image fully at one time. That is why the binocular rivalry occurs. Several factors can influence the duration of gaze on one of the two images. These factors include context, increasing of contrast, motion, spatial frequency, and inverted images. Recent studies have even shown that facial expressions can cause longer attention to a particular image. When an emotional facial expression is presented to one eye, and a neutral expression is presented to the other eye, the emotional face dominates the neutral face and even causes the neutral face to not been seen.

==Disorders==
To maintain stereopsis and singleness of vision, the eyes need to be pointed accurately. The position of each eye in its orbit is controlled by six extraocular muscles. Slight differences in the length or insertion position or strength of the same muscles in the two eyes can lead to a tendency for one eye to drift to a different position in its orbit from the other, especially when one is tired. This is known as phoria. One way to reveal it is with the cover-uncover test. To do this test, look at a cooperative person&#x27;s eyes. Cover one eye of that person with a card. Have the person look at your finger tip. Move the finger around; this is to break the reflex that normally holds a covered eye in the correct vergence position. Hold your finger steady and then uncover the person&#x27;s eye. Look at the uncovered eye. You may see it flick quickly from being wall-eyed or cross-eyed to its correct position. If the uncovered eye moved from out to in, the person has esophoria. If it moved from in to out, the person has exophoria. If the eye did not move at all, the person has orthophoria. Most people have some amount of exophoria or esophoria; it is quite normal. If the uncovered eye also moved vertically, the person has hyperphoria (if the eye moved from down to up) or hypophoria (if the eye moved from up to down). Such vertical phorias are quite rare. It is also possible for the covered eye to rotate in its orbit, such a condition is known as cyclophoria. They are rarer than vertical phorias. Cover test may be used to determine direction of deviation in cyclophorias also.

The cover-uncover test can also be used for more problematic disorders of binocular vision, the tropias. In the cover part of the test, the examiner looks at the first eye as he or she covers the second. If the eye moves from in to out, the person has exotropia. If it moved from out to in, the person has esotropia. People with exotropia or esotropia are wall-eyed or cross-eyed respectively. These are forms of strabismus that can be accompanied by amblyopia. There are numerous definitions of amblyopia. A definition that incorporates all of these defines amblyopia as a unilateral condition in which vision in worse than 20/20 in the absence of any obvious structural or pathologic anomalies, but with one or more of the following conditions occurring before the age of six: amblyogenic anisometropia, constant unilateral esotropia or exotropia, amblyogenic bilateral isometropia, amblyogenic unilateral or bilateral astigmatism, image degradation. When the covered eye is the non-amblyopic eye, the amblyopic eye suddenly becomes the person&#x27;s only means of seeing. The strabismus is revealed by the movement of that eye to fixate on the examiner&#x27;s finger. There are also vertical tropias (hypertropia and hypotropia) and cyclotropias.

Binocular vision anomalies include: diplopia (double vision), visual confusion (the perception of two different images superimposed onto the same space), suppression (where the brain ignores all or part of one eye&#x27;s visual field), horror fusionis (an active avoidance of fusion by eye misalignment), and anomalous retinal correspondence (where the brain associates the fovea of one eye with an extrafoveal area of the other eye).

Binocular vision anomalies are among the most common visual disorders. They are usually associated with symptoms such as headaches, asthenopia, eye pain, blurred vision, and occasional diplopia. About 20% of patients who come to optometry clinics will have binocular vision anomalies. Many children these days are using digital devices for a significant period of time. This could lead to various binocular vision anomalies (such as reduced amplitudes of accommodation, accommodative facility, and positive fusional vergence both at near and distance). The most effective way to diagnosis vision anomalies is with the near point of convergence test. During the NPC test, a target, such as a finger, is brought towards the face until the examiner notices that one eye has turned outward and/or the person has experienced diplopia or doubled vision.

Up to a certain extent, binocular disparities can be compensated for by adjustments of the visual system. If, however, defects of binocular vision are too great – for example if they would require the visual system to adapt to overly large horizontal, vertical, torsional or aniseikonic deviations – the eyes tend to avoid binocular vision, ultimately causing or worsening a condition of strabismus.

<text>Pronunciation is the way in which a word or a language is spoken. This may refer to generally agreed-upon sequences of sounds used in speaking a given word or language in a specific dialect (&quot;correct&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; pronunciation) or simply the way a particular individual speaks a word or language. 

Words&#x27; pronunciations can be found in reference works such as dictionaries. General-purpose dictionaries typically only include standard pronunciations, but regional or dialectal pronunciations may be found in more specific works. Orthoepy the study of the pronunciation of a language.

A word can be spoken in different ways by various individuals or groups, depending on many factors, such as: the duration of the cultural exposure of their childhood, the location of their current residence, speech or voice disorders, their ethnic group, their social class, or their education.

==Linguistic terminology==
Syllables are combinations of units of sound (phones), for example &quot;goo&quot; has one syllable made up of [g] and [u]. The branch of linguistics which studies these units of sound is phonetics. Phones which play the same role are grouped together into classes called phonemes; the study of these is phonemics or phonematics or phonology. Phones as components of articulation are usually described using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

<doc id="192282" wikidata="Q19135" url="?curid=192282" title="Uropygi">
<text>Uropygi is an arachnid order comprising invertebrates commonly known as whip scorpions or vinegaroons (also spelled vinegarroons and vinegarones). They are often called uropygids. The name &quot;whip scorpion&quot; refers to their resemblance to true scorpions and possession of a whiplike tail, and &quot;vinegaroon&quot; refers to their ability when attacked to discharge an offensive, vinegar-smelling liquid, which contains acetic acid. The order may also be called Thelyphonida. Both names, Uropygi and Thelyphonida, may be used either in a narrow sense for the order of whip scorpions, or in a broad sense which includes the order Schizomida.

==Taxonomy==
Carl Linnaeus first described a whip scorpion in 1758, although he did not distinguish it from what are now regarded as different kinds of arachnid, calling it &quot;Phalangium caudatum&quot;. &quot;Phalangium&quot; is now used as a name for a genus of harvestmen (Opiliones). In 1802, Pierre André Latreille was the first to use a genus name solely for whip scorpions, namely &quot;Thelyphonus&quot;. Latreille later explained the name as meaning &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;who kills&quot;.
One name for the order, Thelyphonida, is based on Latreille&#x27;s genus name. It was first used, as the French , by Latreille in 1804, and later by Octavius Pickard-Cambridge in 1872 (with the spelling Thelyphonidea).

The alternative name, Uropygi, was first used by Tamerlan Thorell in 1883. It means &quot;tail rump&quot;, from Ancient Greek (&#x27;), from (&#x27;) &quot;tail&quot; and (&quot;&quot;) &quot;rump&quot; referring to the whip-like flagellum on the end of the pygidium, a small plate made up of the last three segments of the abdominal exoskeleton.

The classification and scientific name used for whip scorpions varies. Originally, Amblypygi (whip spiders), Uropygi and Schizomida (short-tailed whipscorpions) formed a single order of arachnids, Pedipalpi. Pedipalpi was later divided into two orders, Amblypygi and Uropygi (or Uropygida). Schizomida was then split off from Uropygi into a separate order. The remainder has either continued to be called by the same name, Uropygi, possibly distinguished as Uropygi &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, or called Thelyphonida. When the name Uropygi is used for the whip scorpions, the clade containing Uropygi and Schizomida may be called Thelyphonida, or Thelyphonida &quot;s.l.&quot; Conversely, when the name Thelyphonida is used for the whip scorpions alone, the parent clade may be called Uropygi, or Uropygi &quot;sensu lato&quot;. The table below summarizes the two usages. When the qualifications &quot;s.l.&quot; and &quot;s.s.&quot; are omitted, the names Uropygi and Thelyphonida are ambiguous.

Phylogenetic studies show the three groups, Amblypygi, Uropygi &quot;s.s.&quot; and Schizomida, to be closely related. The Uropygi &quot;s.s.&quot; and Schizomida likely diverged in the late Carboniferous, somewhere in the tropics of Pangaea.
==Description==
Whip scorpions range from in length, with most species having a body no longer than ; the largest species, of the genus &quot;Mastigoproctus&quot;, can reach . An extinct &quot;Mesoproctus&quot; from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation could be the same size. Because of their legs, claws, and &quot;whip&quot;, though, they can appear much larger, and the heaviest specimen weighed was 12.4 grams (0.44 oz).

The opisthosoma consists of 12 segments. The first segment forms a pedicel, and each of the next eight segments has dorsal tergites. The last three segments are fused into closed rings that ends with the flagellum, made up of 30-40 units.

Like the related orders Schizomida and Amblypygi, whip scorpions use only six legs for walking, with the first two legs serving as antennae-like sensory organs. All species also have very large scorpion-like pedipalps (pincers) but there is an additional large spine on each palpal tibia. They have one pair of median eyes at the front of the cephalothorax and up till five pairs of lateral eyes on each side of the head, a pattern also found in scorpions. Whip scorpions have no venom glands, but they have glands near the rear of their abdomen that can spray a combination of acetic acid and caprylic acid when they are bothered. The acetic acid gives this spray a vinegar-like smell, giving rise to the common name &quot;vinegaroon&quot;.

==Behaviour==
Whip scorpions are carnivorous, nocturnal hunters feeding mostly on insects, millipedes, scorpions, and terrestrial isopods, but sometimes on worms and slugs. &quot;Mastigoproctus&quot; sometimes preys on small vertebrates. The prey is crushed between special teeth on the inside of the trochanters (the second segment of the &quot;legs&quot;) of the front appendages. They are valuable in controlling the population of cockroaches and crickets.

Males secrete a spermatophore (a united mass of sperm), which is transferred to the female following courtship behaviour, in which the male holds the ends of the female&#x27;s first legs in his chelicerae. The spermatophore is deposited on the ground and picked up by the female using her genital area. In some genera, the male then uses his pedipalps to push the spermatophore into her body.
After a few months, the female will dig a large burrow and seal herself inside. Up to 40 eggs are , within a membranous broodsac that preserves moisture and remains attached to the genital operculum and the fifth segment of the mother&#x27;s ventral opisthosoma. The female refuses to eat and holds her opisthosoma in an upward arch so that the broodsac does not touch the ground for the next few months, as the eggs develop into . Appendages become visible.

The white young that hatch from the postembryos climb onto their mother&#x27;s back and attach themselves there with special suckers. After the first moult, when they look like miniature adults but with bright red palps, they leave the burrow. The mother may live up to two more years. The young grow slowly, going through four moults in about four years before reaching adulthood. They live for up to another four years.

==Distribution and habitat==
Whip scorpions are found in tropical and subtropical areas, excluding Europe and Australia. Also, only a single species is known from Africa: &quot;Etienneus africanus&quot;, probably a Gondwana relict, endemic to Senegal, the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. 

They usually dig burrows with their pedipalps, to which they transport their prey. They may also burrow under logs, rotting wood, rocks, and other natural debris. They prefer humid, dark places and avoid light. &quot;Mastigoproctus giganteus&quot;, the giant whip scorpion, is found in more arid areas, including Arizona and New Mexico.

==Subtaxa==

As of 2023, the &quot;World Uropygi Catalog&quot; accepted the following 16 extant genera, all placed in the family Thelyphonidae:
* &quot;Etienneus&quot; 
* &quot;Ginosigma&quot; 
* &quot;Glyptogluteus&quot; 
* &quot;Hypoctonus&quot; 
* &quot;Labochirus&quot; 
* &quot;Mastigoproctus&quot; 
* &quot;Mayacentrum&quot; 
* &quot;Mimoscorpius&quot; 
* &quot;Ravilops&quot; 
* &quot;Sheylayongium&quot;

* &quot;Thelyphonus&quot; 
* &quot;Typopeltis&quot; 
* &quot;Uroproctus&quot; 
* &quot;Valeriophonus&quot; 
In addition, seven extinct genera were accepted, two within the family Thelyphonidae:
* †&quot;Mesoproctus&quot; 
* †&quot;Mesothelyphonus&quot; 
and five unplaced as to family:
* †&quot;Burmathelyphonia&quot;

<text>Heinrich Karl Ludolf von Sybel (2 December 1817 – 1 August 1895) was a German historian and politician, who served in the Landtag of Prussia from 1862 to 1864 and from 1874 to 1880. He was a professor at the University of Bonn from 1861 to 1875 and director of the Prussian Archives from 1875.

== Life ==

Sybel came from a Protestant family which had long been established at Soest. He was born in Düsseldorf, where his father held important posts in the public service under both the French and the Prussians; in 1831 he was raised to the hereditary nobility. His home was one of the centres of the vigorous literary and artistic life for which Düsseldorf was renowned at that time. Sybel was educated at the local Gymnasium, and then at the University of Berlin, where he came under the influences of Friedrich Carl von Savigny and Leopold von Ranke, whose most distinguished pupil he was to become.

After taking his degree, he settled down in 1841 as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in history at the university of Bonn. He had already made himself known by critical studies on the history of the Middle Ages, of which the most important was his &quot;Geschichte des ersten Kreuzzuges&quot; (&quot;History of the First Crusade&quot;) (Düsseldorf, 1841; new ed., Leipzig, 1881), a work which, besides its merit as a valuable piece of historical investigation employing the critical methods he had learnt from Ranke, was also of some significance as a protest against the vaguely enthusiastic attitude encouraged by the Romantic school towards the Middle Ages. In 1861 Lady Duff-Gordon published an English translation of a part of this book, to which were added lectures on the crusades delivered in Munich in 1858, under the title &quot;History and Literature of the Crusades&quot;. This was followed by a study of the growth of German kingship (&quot;Die Entstehung des deutschen Königtums&quot;, Frankfurt, 1844, and again 1881), after which he was appointed professor.

In the same year (1844) Sybel became prominent as an opponent of the Ultramontane party. The exhibition of the Holy Shroud at Trier had attracted enormous numbers of pilgrims, and so, indignant at what appeared to him a fake, he assisted in publishing an investigation into the authenticity of the celebrated relic. From this time he began to take an active part in contemporary politics and in controversy as a strong but moderate Liberal. In 1846 he was appointed professor at Marburg, and though this small university offered little scope for his activities as a teacher, a seat in the Hessian &quot;Landtag&quot; gave him his first experience of politics. In 1848 he was present at Frankfurt, but he did not succeed in winning a seat for the National Assembly. His opposition to the extreme democratic and revolutionary party made him unpopular with the mob who broke his windows, and his liberalism made him suspect at court. He sat in the Erfurt parliament of 1850, and was attached to the Gotha party, which hoped for the regeneration of Germany through the leadership of Prussia.

During the period 1859–1866, Sybel was engaged in a literary controversy with the historian, Julius von Ficker, on the significance of the German Empire.
During the years that followed he was occupied with his major chronicle of the French Revolution, &quot;Geschichte der Revolutionszeit 1789–1800&quot;, for which he had made prolonged studies in the archives of Paris and other countries. The later editions of the earlier volumes were enlarged and altered, and a new edition was published at Stuttgart in 1882. The first three volumes were translated into English by Walter Copland Perry (1867–1869). In this work he showed for the first time the connection between the internal and external history of France. By systematically studying the records, he was also the first to check and correct the traditional account of many episodes of France&#x27;s internal history. He demonstrated that letters attributed to Marie Antoinette were not genuine. He undermined the influential revolutionary legends, expounded by French writers. Sybel was interested in Edmund Burke, on whom he had published two essays. The work was in fact the first attempt to substitute for the popular view of Thiers and Lamartine, a line which was later taken up by Taine and Albert Sorel.

In 1856, on the recommendation of Ranke, Sybel accepted the post of professor at Munich, where King Maximilian II of Bavaria, a generous patron of learning, hoped to establish a school of history. Here he found a fruitful field for his activity. Besides continuing his work on the Revolution and on the Middle Ages, he occupied himself fully with the Historical Seminar which he instituted; with the &quot;Historische Zeitschrift&quot; which he founded - the original model of the numerous historical periodicals which now exist – and as secretary of the new Historical Commission. Political differences soon interfered with his work; as a supporter of Prussia and a Protestant, especially as a militant champion against the Ultramontanes, he was from the first an object of suspicion to the Clerical party. In the political excitement which followed the war of 1859 he found that he could not hope for the unreserved support of the king, and therefore in 1861 he accepted a professorship at Bonn, which he held until 1875.

He was elected a member of the Prussian Lower House, and during the next three years was one of the most active members of that assembly. In several important debates he led the attack on the government, and opposed the policy of Bismarck, not only on finances but also on Polish and Danish affairs, in particular the impending crisis with Denmark over Schleswig and Holstein. In 1864 he did not stand for re-election, owing to an eye infection, but in 1866 he was one of the first to point out the way to a reconciliation between Bismarck and his former opponents. He had a seat in the Constituent Assembly of 1867, and while he joined the National Liberals he distinguished himself by opposing the introduction of universal suffrage, sharing the distrust of many Liberals over its effects. In 1874 he returned to the Prussian parliament in order to support the government in its conflict with the Clericals, and after 1878 with the Socialists. He explained and justified his position in two pamphlets that analysed the teaching of the Socialists and traced Clerical policy during the 19th century. In 1880 he retired, like so many other Liberals, disheartened by the change in political life which he blamed on universal suffrage.

In 1875, Bismarck appointed him to the post of director of the Prussian archives. Under his superintendence was begun the great series of publications, besides that of the correspondence of Frederick the Great, which he helped to edit. His last years were occupied with his great work, &quot;Die Begründung des deutschen Reiches durch Wilhelm I&quot; (&quot;The Founding of the German Empire under William I&quot;)(Munich, 1889–1894), a work of great importance on German unification, for which he was allowed to use the Prussian state papers and was therefore able to write a history of the greatest events of his own time with full access to highly secret sources of information. As a history of Prussian policy from 1860 to 1866 it is of incomparable value. After the fall of Bismarck permission to use the secret papers was withdrawn, and therefore vols. vi. and vii., which deal with the years 1866 to 1870, are of less importance. This work has been translated into English as &quot;The Founding of the German Empire&quot;, by M L Perrin and G Bradford (New York, 1890–1891). Sybel did not live to write an account of the war with France, dying at Marburg on 1 August 1895. His other writings include &quot;Die deutsche Nation und das Kaiserreich&quot; (1862) and a large number of historical articles.

Sybel left two sons, one of whom became an officer in the Prussian army; the other, Ludwig von Sybel (1846-1929), a professor of archaeology in the university of Marburg, was the author of several works dealing with Greek archaeology.

Some of Sybel&#x27;s numerous historical and political essays have been collected in &quot;Kleine historische Schriften&quot; (3 vols, 1863, 1869, 1881; new ed., 1897); &quot;Vorträge und Aufsätze&quot; (Berlin, 1874); and &quot;Vorträge und Abhandlungen&quot;, published after his death with a biographical introduction by Conrad Varrentrapp (Munich, 1897).

<doc id="192294" wikidata="Q4530507" url="?curid=192294" title="Screened Poisson equation">
<text>In physics, the screened Poisson equation is a Poisson equation, which arises in (for example) the Klein–Gordon equation, electric field screening in plasmas, and nonlocal granular fluidity in granular flow.

==Statement of the equation==

The equation is
formula_1

where formula_2 is the Laplace operator, &quot;λ&quot; is a constant that expresses the &quot;screening&quot;, &quot;f&quot; is an arbitrary function of position (known as the &quot;source function&quot;) and &quot;u&quot; is the function to be determined.

In the homogeneous case (&quot;f&quot;=0), the screened Poisson equation is the same as the time-independent Klein–Gordon equation. In the inhomogeneous case, the screened Poisson equation is very similar to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation, the only difference being the sign within the brackets.

=== Electrostatics ===
In electric-field screening, screened Poisson equation for the electric potential formula_3 is usually written as (SI units)

formula_4

where formula_5 is the screening length, formula_6 is the charge density produced by an external field in the absence of screening and formula_7 is the vacuum permittivity. This equation can be derived in several screening models like Thomas–Fermi screening in solid-state physics and Debye screening in plasmas.

==Solutions==

===Three dimensions===

Without loss of generality, we will take &quot;λ&quot; to be non-negative. When &quot;λ&quot; is zero, the equation reduces to Poisson&#x27;s equation. Therefore, when &quot;λ&quot; is very small, the solution approaches that of the unscreened Poisson equation, which, in dimension formula_8, is a superposition of 1/&quot;r&quot; functions weighted by the source function &quot;f&quot;:

formula_9

On the other hand, when &quot;λ&quot; is extremely large, &quot;u&quot; approaches the value &quot;f&quot;/&quot;λ&quot;2, which goes to zero as &quot;λ&quot; goes to infinity. As we shall see, the solution for intermediate values of &quot;λ&quot; behaves as a superposition of screened (or damped) 1/&quot;r&quot; functions, with &quot;λ&quot; behaving as the strength of the screening.

The screened Poisson equation can be solved for general &quot;f&quot; using the method of Green&#x27;s functions. The Green&#x27;s function &quot;G&quot; is defined by

formula_10
where δ3 is a delta function with unit mass concentrated at the origin of R3.

Assuming &quot;u&quot; and its derivatives vanish at large &quot;r&quot;, we may perform a continuous Fourier transform in spatial coordinates:

formula_11

where the integral is taken over all space. It is then straightforward to show that

formula_12

The Green&#x27;s function in &quot;r&quot; is therefore given by the inverse Fourier transform,

formula_13

This integral may be evaluated using spherical coordinates in &quot;k&quot;-space. The integration over the angular coordinates is straightforward, and the integral reduces to one over the radial wavenumber formula_14:

formula_15

This may be evaluated using contour integration. The result is:

formula_16

The solution to the full problem is then given by

formula_17

As stated above, this is a superposition of screened 1/&quot;r&quot; functions, weighted by the source function &quot;f&quot; and with &quot;λ&quot; acting as the strength of the screening. The screened 1/&quot;r&quot; function is often encountered in physics as a screened Coulomb potential, also called a &quot;Yukawa potential&quot;.

===Two dimensions===
In two dimensions:
In the case of a magnetized plasma, the screened Poisson equation is quasi-2D:
formula_18
with formula_19 and formula_20, with formula_21 the magnetic field and formula_22 is the (ion) Larmor radius.
The two-dimensional Fourier Transform of the associated Green&#x27;s function is:
formula_23
The 2D screened Poisson equation yields:
formula_24
The Green&#x27;s function is therefore given by the inverse Fourier transform:
formula_25
This integral can be calculated using polar coordinates in k-space:
formula_26
The integration over the angular coordinate gives a Bessel function, and the integral reduces to one over the radial wavenumber formula_14:
formula_28

==Connection to the Laplace distribution==
The Green&#x27;s functions in both 2D and 3D are identical to the probability density function of the multivariate Laplace distribution for two and three dimensions respectively.

==Application in differential geometry==
The homogeneous case, studied in the context of differential geometry, involving Einstein warped product manifolds, explores cases where the warped function satisfies the homogeneous version of the screened Poisson equation. Under specific conditions, the manifold size, Ricci curvature, and screening parameter are interconnected via a quadratic relationship.

<doc id="192296" wikidata="Q1128896" url="?curid=192296" title="Resignation from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom">
<text>As a constitutional convention, members of Parliament (MPs) sitting in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom are not formally permitted to resign their seats. To circumvent this prohibition, MPs who wish to step down are instead appointed to an &quot;office of profit under the Crown&quot;; by law, such an appointment disqualifies them from sitting in the House of Commons. For this purpose, a legal fiction has been maintained whereby two unpaid sinecures are considered to be offices of profit: Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, and Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead.

Since the passage of the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, &quot;offices for profit&quot; are no longer disqualifying in general, but the explicit list of hundreds of disqualifying offices contained in the act now includes the two stewardships so that this convention can be continued. It is rare for an MP to be nominated to a legitimate office of profit on the disqualifying list; no MPs have lost their seat by being appointed to an actual office since 1981, when Thomas Williams became a judge.

== Offices used for disqualification ==

Members of Parliament (MPs) wishing to give up their seats before the next general election are appointed to an office which causes the MP to be disqualified from membership. Historically, all &quot;offices of profit under the Crown&quot; could be used for this purpose. However, only two are still in use:

* Crown Steward and Bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham
* Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead

The stewardships are unpaid positions that provide no benefits and carry no responsibilities. The Chiltern Hundreds last required an actual Steward in the 16th century. The main property of the Manor of Northstead was described in 1600 as &quot;unfit for habitation&quot; after &quot;it fell down&quot;. The stewardships have been maintained as nominal offices of profit solely as a legal fiction to meet the requirements of the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and its predecessors.

The offices are used alternately, making it possible for two members to resign at the same time. When more than two MPs resign at a time—for example, when 15 Ulster Unionist MPs resigned in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement on 17 December 1985—the resignations are, in theory, not simultaneous but spread throughout the day, enabling each member to hold one of the offices for a short time. The former office-holder may subsequently be reelected to Parliament.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

Resignation from the House of Commons has never been allowed in theory, although five MPs were allowed to resign in the early 17th century on grounds of ill health. On 2 March 1624 N.S., Parliament formalized the prohibition by passing a resolution &quot;... that a man, after he is duly chosen, cannot relinquish.&quot; At the time, serving in Parliament was considered an obligation to be borne rather than a position of power and honour. Members had to travel to Westminster over a primitive road system, a real problem for those who represented more distant constituencies. An MP could not effectively tend to personal business at home while he was away at Parliament, yet MPs were unpaid until 1911.

Originally, the disqualification of office holders from Parliament came about as part of the long struggle to ensure that Parliament would remain free from undue influence on the part of the monarch. Since anyone receiving a salary from the Crown could not be truly independent, the House of Commons passed a resolution on 30 December 1680 stating that an MP who &quot;shall accept any Office, or Place of Profit, from the Crown, without the Leave of this House ... shall be expelled [from] this House.&quot; The prohibition was strengthened over the following decades to bar MPs from simultaneously holding certain offices. However, MPs were able to hold crown stewardships until 1740, when Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn became Steward of the Lordship and Manor of Bromfield and Yale and was deemed to have vacated his Commons seat. The Irish House of Commons largely followed the procedure of the English Commons; however, whereas in England the prohibition on MPs holding offices under the crown continued to rest on resolutions, the Parliament of Ireland passed an act in 1793 to enforce it.

=== Development of procedure ===

After the precedent set in 1740, it became possible for MPs to step down by being appointed to a crown stewardship. The procedure was invented by John Pitt, who wanted to vacate his seat for Wareham in order to stand for Dorchester, as he could not be a candidate while he was still an MP. Moreover, it quickly became apparent that if ministers of the Crown were to be meaningfully responsible to Parliament, they needed to be able to sit in the House of Commons. For this reason, someone appointed to an office of profit was only disqualified from &quot;continuing&quot; to sit in the House of Commons; it was possible for someone already in office to be (re-)elected to Parliament without relinquishing the office.

Pitt wrote to Prime Minister Henry Pelham in May 1750, reporting he had been invited to stand in Dorchester, and asking for &quot;a new mark of his Majesty&#x27;s favour [to] enable me to do him these further services&quot;. Pelham wrote to William Pitt (the elder) indicating that he would intervene with King George II to help. On 17 January 1751, Pitt was appointed to the office of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, and was then elected unopposed for Dorchester. The Manor of Northstead was first used for resignation on 6 April 1842 by Patrick Chalmers, Member for the Montrose District of Burghs.

The Chancellor may in theory deny an application, although the last time this happened was to Viscount Chelsea in 1842. In the debate over expelling the fugitive James Sadleir in 1856, the Government committed to refusing any potential application he would make. After Edwin James was appointed to the Chiltern Hundreds upon fleeing to the United States with a £10,000 debt in the 1860s, the letter of appointment was revised to omit the customary mention of the position as one of honour. When Charles Bradlaugh took the Chiltern Hundreds in 1884 to seek a vote of confidence from his constituents, Lord Randolph Churchill and the Conservative press were highly critical of the Gladstone government for allowing Bradlaugh a new opportunity to demonstrate his popularity with the electors of Northampton.

Sections 24 and 25 of the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 listed ministerial offices as offices of profit. When an MP became a government minister, including Prime Minister, they also lost their seat in the House of Commons. Therefore, Ministers were required to regain their seats in Parliament by winning a ministerial by-election. The &quot;Re-election of Ministers Act 1919&quot; made it unnecessary to be re-elected within nine months of a general election, and the Act was amended in 1926 to abolish ministerial by-elections entirely.

===Sinn Féin resignations===

On 20 January 2011, Sinn Féin MP Gerry Adams submitted a letter of resignation to the Speaker, but did not apply for a Crown office, which would be politically unacceptable for a Sinn Féin politician. On 26 January, a Treasury spokesperson said &quot;Consistent with long-standing precedent, the Chancellor has taken [the letter] as a request to be appointed the Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead and granted the office.&quot; Although David Cameron said during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions that Adams had &quot;accepted an office for profit under the Crown&quot;, Adams denied this; he continued to simply reject the title, albeit not its effect of removal from office.

Another Sinn Féin MP, Martin McGuinness, resigned and was formally appointed as Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead on 2 January 2013, leading to the 2013 Mid Ulster by-election. McGuinness also said that he rejected the title.

== Present status ==

=== Law ===

The law relating to resignation is now codified and consolidated in section 4 of the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975:

Schedule 1 lists actual offices that are disqualifying for membership in the House of Commons. Under Section 6, anyone appointed to those offices is prohibited from being elected to the House or continuing to sit in the House. However, the Stewardships of the Chiltern Hundreds and the Manor of Northstead are only included in Schedule 1 for the purpose of vacating the seat. Stewards can still be elected to the House of Commons after taking up their appointments.

=== Notice and orders ===
An MP applies for the office to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who usually then signs a warrant appointing the MP to the Crown office. The appointee holds the office until such time as another MP is appointed, or they apply to be released. Sometimes this can be a matter of minutes, as on an occasion when three or more MPs apply on the same day. Once released, they are again free to seek election to the House of Commons.

When an MP is appointed to the post, the Treasury releases a public notice: &quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer has this day appointed [named individual] to be Steward and Bailiff of the (Three Hundreds of Chiltern / Manor of Northstead).&quot;

After the Speaker has been notified, the appointment and resulting disqualification is noted in the Vote and Proceedings, the Commons&#x27; daily journal of proceedings:
Notification, laid upon the Table by the Speaker, That Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer had today appointed [named individual], Member for [named constituency], to the office of Steward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern.
Thereafter, the former MP&#x27;s party (or the Government, if they were independent, their party has no other MPs or the party is abstentionist) moves for a writ of election to be issued calling for a by-election. The resulting order is in the following form:
&quot;Ordered,&quot;
That the Speaker do issue his Warrant for the Clerk of the Crown to make out a new writ for the electing of a Member to serve in this present parliament for the [County Constituency] of [named area] in the room of the [Right Honourable] [named individual], who since election for the said [County Constituency] has been appointed to the (Office of Steward and Bailiff of His Majesty&#x27;s Three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham in the County of Buckingham/Office of Steward and Bailiff of His Majesty&#x27;s Manor of Northstead in the County of York).
The wording of these announcements may vary.

==Former offices==

Other offices formerly used for the same purpose are:

*Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of East Hendred, Berkshire. This stewardship was first used for parliamentary purposes in November 1763 by Edward Southwell, and was in more or less constant use until 1840, after which it disappeared. This manor comprised copyholds, the usual courts were held, and the stewardship was an actual and active office. The manor was sold by public auction in 1823, but in some manner the Crown retained the right of appointing a steward for seventeen years afterwards.
*Steward of the Manor of Hempholme, Yorkshire. This manor appears to have been of the same nature as that of Northstead. It was in lease until 1835. It was first used for parliamentary purposes in 1845 and was in constant use until 1865. It was sold in 1866.
*Escheator of Munster. Escheators were officers commissioned to secure the rights of the Crown over property which had legally escheated (forfeited) to it from those who had held land from the crown and had recently died (or been legally attainted). In Ireland mention is made of escheators as early as 1256. In 1605 the escheatorship of Ireland was split into four, one for each province, but the duties soon became practically nominal. The escheatorship of Munster was first used for parliamentary purposes in the Irish Parliament from 1793 to 1800, and in the united Parliament (24 times for Irish seats and once for a Scottish seat) from 1801 to 1820. After 1820 it was discontinued and finally abolished in 1838.
*Steward of the Manor of Old Shoreham, Sussex. This manor belonged to the Duchy of Cornwall. It was first used for parliamentary purposes in 1756, and then, occasionally, until 1799, in which year it was sold by the Duchy to the Duke of Norfolk.
*Steward of the Manor of Poynings, Sussex. This manor reverted to the Crown on the death of Lord Montague about 1804, but was leased until about 1835. It was only twice used for parliamentary purposes, in 1841 and 1843.
*Escheator of Ulster. This appointment was used in the united Parliament three times, for Irish seats only; the last time in 1819.
** February 1801: William Talbot (Kilkenny City)
** March 1804: John Claudius Beresford (Dublin City)
** February 1819: Richard Nevill (Wexford Borough)
*Steward of the Honour of Otford, Kent. Used once in 1742 for Lord Middlesex (East Grinstead).
*Chief Steward and Keeper of the Courts of the Honour of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Northampton (part of the Duchy of Cornwall). Used once in 1752 for Henry Lascelles (Northallerton).
*Steward of the Manor of Kennington, Surrey. Used once in 1757 for Thomas Duckett (Calne).
*Steward of the Manor of Shippon, Berkshire. Used once in 1765 for Thomas Watson (Berwick-upon-Tweed).
*A different kind of appointment, the militia agency, has also been used. For example, in 1770 Jervoise Clarke Jervoise was appointed to the office of agent to the regiment of militia of the county of Sussex, as a consequence of him not being able to be appointed to the customary stewardships at that time. Similar offices were used on at least two more occasions.

<doc id="192299" wikidata="Q838265" url="?curid=192299" title="Northstead">
<text>Northstead is an area on the North Bay of Scarborough in North Yorkshire, England. The area near Newlands and Barrowcliff includes Peasholm Park and Scarborough Open Air Theatre.

In 2011, the namesake ward had a population of 4,038. Since 2019 the ward no longer covers the area, with most of the old ward now in the Woodlands ward.

==History==
The Manor of Northstead consisted of a medieval manor house surrounded by fields and farms in the parish of Scalby in the North Riding of Yorkshire. The estate originally bordered the northern side of the ancient boundary of the Borough of Scarborough, following the line of Peasholm Beck. The estate passed into the ownership of the Crown during the reign of King Richard III (1483–1485). By 1600, the manor house had fallen into disrepair, being latterly occupied by Sir Richard Cholmeley&#x27;s shepherd until it finally collapsed. 

The land, but not the lordship of the manor, was bought from the Crown by the Scarborough Corporation in 1921. The manor house for the former estate no longer exists and the land has since been redeveloped as part of modern-day Scarborough. The site of the manor house is believed to have been covered by the lake in Peasholm Park, a municipal park opened in 1912.

==Politics==

The ancient title of the Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead persisted beyond the manor, however, being used since the 19th century as a sinecure post which plays a role in the procedure for effecting Resignation from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

By virtue of the fact that it became and was retained as a Lordship of the Crown beyond the sale and eventual disappearance of the estate, since the 19th century the post of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead has played a role in the procedure for effecting Resignation from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by Members of Parliament (MPs). While no longer having any actual role or responsibility, it remains a nominal paid office of the Crown, a sort of sinecure, appointment to which is one of the things that by law disqualifies an MP from the House. This principle goes back to the Act of Settlement 1701, and is now regulated by the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975. Since 1623, MPs have not been permitted to resign their seats directly. Although several such offices have been used for this purpose in the past, in the present day only two are used: the Northstead post and that of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham.

Most references say that the Northstead post was first used in this way on 20 March 1844 to allow Sir George Henry Rose, Member for Christchurch, to resign his seat. But the official book recording appointments to the various stewardships (lodged in The National Archives under catalogue reference E 197/1) indicates that Patrick Chalmers, MP for Montrose Burghs, was appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead on 6 April 1842. The writ of election for a replacement was moved as if Chalmers had been appointed to the Chiltern Hundreds.

Appointments to the posts are made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Using two posts allows more than one MP to resign simultaneously, although more commonly, single resignations are effected by alternating appointments to the Northstead and Chiltern Hundreds offices. One of the most recent MPs to be appointed to the Northstead office was former Prime Minister David Cameron, who announced his decision to resign from his parliamentary seat of Witney on 12 September 2016.

===Appointment of Gerry Adams===
Sinn Féin MP Gerry Adams was appointed to the post after announcing his intention to resign from the UK Parliament to stand in the 2011 Irish general election. Adams denied that he had accepted the appointment, which would conflict with Sinn Féin&#x27;s longstanding policy of refusing to pledge allegiance to the British Crown. It was later clarified in Parliament that Adams had not &quot;accepted&quot; the post, but had been appointed to it on announcing his desire to resign as an MP.

<doc id="192303" wikidata="Q473" url="?curid=192303" title="The Library of Babel">
<text>&quot;The Library of Babel&quot; () is a short story by Argentine author and librarian Jorge Luis Borges (1899–1986), conceiving of a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a certain format and character set.

The story was originally published in Spanish in Borges&#x27; 1941 collection of stories &quot;El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan&quot; (&quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;). That entire book was, in turn, included within his much-reprinted &quot;Ficciones&quot; (1944). Two English-language translations appeared approximately simultaneously in 1962, one by James E. Irby in a diverse collection of Borges&#x27;s works titled &quot;Labyrinths&quot; and the other by Anthony Kerrigan as part of a collaborative translation of the entirety of &quot;Ficciones&quot;.

==Plot==
Borges&#x27; narrator describes how his universe consists of an enormous expanse of adjacent hexagonal rooms. In each room, there is an opening in the floor to the hexagons above and below, four walls of bookshelves, and two junctions between hexagons each containing a latrine, a sleeping closet, and a stairwell. Though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless, the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic characters (22 letters, the period, the comma, and space). Though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish, the laws of probability dictate that the library also must contain, somewhere, every coherent book ever written, or that might ever be written, and every possible permutation or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books. The narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information, including predictions of the future, biographies of any person, and translations of every book in all languages. Conversely, for many of the texts, some language could be devised that would make it readable with any of a vast number of different contents.

Despite these theories, all books are functionally totally useless to the reader, as any correct, legible text that can exist occurs due to pure chance and must exist alongside countless completely incorrect writings. This leads to many superstitions, cults, and heresies within the wider organized religion of the library; The &quot;Purifiers&quot; arbitrarily destroy books they deem nonsense as they scour through the library seeking the &quot;Crimson Hexagon&quot; and its illustrated, magical books. Others believe that since all books exist in the library, somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library&#x27;s contents; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the &quot;Man of the Book&quot; has read it, and they travel through the library seeking him. The narrator notes the population of the library has been gravely decimated by centuries of religious conflict and disease, but maintains his faith in the beauty and organization of the library as undeniable proof of a God or other demiurge, reaffirming his own attempts to find some ultimate meaning to the library and humanity&#x27;s existence within it.

==Themes==

The story repeats the theme of Borges&#x27; 1939 essay &quot;The Total Library&quot; (&quot;La Biblioteca Total&quot;), which in turn acknowledges the earlier development of this theme by Kurd Lasswitz in his 1901 story &quot;The Universal Library&quot; (&quot;Die Universalbibliothek&quot;):

Certain examples that Aristotle attributes to Democritus and Leucippus clearly prefigure it, but its belated inventor is Gustav Theodor Fechner, and its first exponent, Kurd Lasswitz. [...] In his book &quot;The Race with the Tortoise&quot; (Berlin, 1919), Dr Theodor Wolff suggests that it is a derivation from, or a parody of, Ramón Llull&#x27;s thinking machine [...] The elements of his game are the universal orthographic symbols, not the words of a language [...] Lasswitz arrives at twenty-five symbols (twenty-two letters, the space, the period, the comma), whose recombinations and repetitions encompass everything possible to express in all languages. The totality of such variations would form a Total Library of astronomical size. Lasswitz urges mankind to construct that inhuman library, which chance would organize and which would eliminate intelligence. (Wolff&#x27;s &quot;The Race with the Tortoise&quot; expounds the execution and the dimensions of that impossible enterprise.)

Many of Borges&#x27; signature motifs are featured in the story, including infinity, reality, cabalistic reasoning, and labyrinths. The concept of the library is often compared to Borel&#x27;s dactylographic monkey theorem. There is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in &quot;The Library of Babel&quot;, although Borges had mentioned that analogy in &quot;The Total Library&quot;: &quot;[A] half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum.&quot; In this story, the closest equivalent is the line, &quot;A blasphemous sect suggested [...] that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books.&quot; Borges makes an oblique reference to reproducing Shakespeare, as the only decipherable sentence in one of the books in the library, &quot;O time thy pyramids&quot;, is surely taken from Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnet 123 which opens with the lines &quot;No Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change, Thy pyramids...&quot;.

Borges would examine a similar idea in his 1976 story, &quot;The Book of Sand&quot;, in which there is an infinite book (or book with an indefinite number of pages) rather than an infinite library. Moreover, the story&#x27;s &quot;Book of Sand&quot; is said to be written in an unknown alphabet and its content is not obviously random. In The Library of Babel, Borges interpolates Italian mathematician Bonaventura Cavalieri&#x27;s suggestion that any solid body could be conceptualized as the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.

The concept of the library is also overtly analogous to the view of the universe as a sphere having its center everywhere and its circumference nowhere. The mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal employed this metaphor, and in an earlier essay Borges noted that Pascal&#x27;s manuscript called the sphere &quot;effroyable,&quot; or &quot;frightful&quot;.

The quote at the beginning of the story, &quot;By this art you may contemplate the variation of the twenty-three letters,&quot; is from Robert Burton&#x27;s 1621 &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;.

==Philosophical implications==
===Infinite extent===
In mainstream theories of natural language syntax, every syntactically valid utterance can be extended to produce a new, longer one, because of recursion. However, the books in the Library of Babel are of bounded length (&quot;each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters&quot;), so the Library can only contain a finite number of distinct strings. Borges&#x27; narrator notes this fact, but believes that the Library is nevertheless infinite; he speculates that it repeats itself periodically, giving an eventual &quot;order&quot; to the &quot;disorder&quot; of the seemingly random arrangement of books. Mathematics professor William Goldbloom Bloch confirms the narrator&#x27;s intuition, deducing in his popular mathematics book &quot;The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges&#x27; Library of Babel&quot; that the library&#x27;s structure necessarily has at least one room whose shelves are not full (because the number of books per room does not divide the total number of books evenly), and the rooms on each floor of the library must either be connected into a single Hamiltonian cycle, or possibly be disconnected into subsets that cannot reach each other.

===Quine&#x27;s reduction===
W. V. O. Quine notes that the Library of Babel is finite, and that any text that does not fit in a single book can be reconstructed by finding a second book with the continuation. The size of the alphabet can be reduced by using Morse code even though it makes the books more verbose; the size of the books can also be reduced by splitting each into multiple volumes and discarding the duplicates. Writes Quine, &quot;The ultimate absurdity is now staring us in the face: a universal library of two volumes, one containing a single dot and the other a dash. Persistent repetition and alternation of the two are sufficient, we well know, for spelling out any and every truth. The miracle of the finite but universal library is a mere inflation of the miracle of binary notation: everything worth saying, and everything else as well, can be said with two characters.&quot;

==Comparison with biology==
The full possible set of protein sequences (protein sequence space) has been compared to the Library of Babel. In the &quot;Library of Babel&quot;, finding any book that made sense was almost impossible due to the sheer number and lack of order. The same would be true of protein sequences if it were not for natural selection, which has picked out only protein sequences that make sense. Additionally, each protein sequence is surrounded by a set of neighbors (point mutants) that are likely to have at least some function. Daniel Dennett&#x27;s 1995 book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot; includes an elaboration of the Library of Babel concept to imagine the set of all possible genetic sequences, which he calls the Library of Mendel, in order to illustrate the mathematics of genetic variation. Dennett uses this concept again later in the book to imagine all possible algorithms that can be included in his Toshiba computer, which he calls the Library of Toshiba. He describes the Library of Mendel and the Library of Toshiba as subsets within the Library of Babel.

==Influence on later works==
* Érik Desmazières provided etched illustrations for a 1997 edition of the short story, depicting the library as literally built in the shape of Bruegel&#x27;s &quot;Tower of Babel&quot;.
*Umberto Eco&#x27;s postmodern novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1980) features a labyrinthine library, presided over by a blind monk named Jorge of Burgos. The room is, however, octagonal in shape.
*Russell Standish&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Nothing&quot; uses the concept of the Library of Babel to illustrate how an ultimate ensemble containing all possible descriptions would in sum contain zero information and would thus be the simplest possible explanation for the existence of the universe. This theory, therefore, implies the reality of all universes.
*&quot;The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges&#x27; Library of Babel&quot; (2008) by William Goldbloom Bloch explores the short story from a mathematical perspective. Bloch analyzes the hypothetical library presented by Borges using the ideas of topology, information theory, and geometry.
*In Greg Bear&#x27;s novel &quot;City at the End of Time&quot; (2008), the sum-runners carried by the protagonists are intended by their creator to be combined to form a &#x27;Babel&#x27;, an infinite library containing every possible permutation of every possible character in every possible language. Bear has stated that this was inspired by Borges, who is also namechecked in the novel. Borges is described as an unknown Argentinian who commissioned an encyclopedia of impossible things, a reference to either &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; or the &quot;Book of Imaginary Beings&quot;.
*The Library of Babel, a website created by Jonathan Basile, emulates an English-language version of Borges&#x27; library. An algorithm he created generates a &quot;book&quot; by iterating every permutation of 29 characters: the 26 English letters, space, comma, and period. Each book is marked by a coordinate, corresponding to its place on the hexagonal library (hexagon name, wall number, shelf number, and book name) so that every book can be found at the same place every time. The website is said to contain &quot;all possible pages of 3200 characters, about 104677 books&quot;. For example, a coordinate may look like &quot;389fj39l-w4-s5-v32&quot; where, &quot;389fj39l&quot; is the hexagon name, &quot;w4&quot; specifies wall 4, &quot;s5&quot; specifies shelf 5, and &quot;v32&quot; specifies volume 32.
*In Steven L. Peck&#x27;s novella &quot;A Short Stay In Hell&quot; (2009), the protagonist must find the book of his life&#x27;s story in a library containing every possible book. Borges&#x27; story is mentioned directly, although the library is structured very differently. It is also explicitly finite in size, though it is more than a million orders of magnitude larger than the observable universe.
*&quot;Library of Ruina&quot; (2020) is a South Korean deck-building video game whose titular location is heavily inspired by the Library of Babel. People defeated in combat within the library are turned into books that can be manipulated in various means, which leads to the protagonist Angela trying to find the &quot;One True Book&quot;.

<text>The Caproni Campini N.1, also known as the C.C.2, is an experimental jet aircraft built in the 1930s by Italian aircraft manufacturer Caproni. The N.1 first flew in 1940 and was briefly regarded as the first successful jet-powered aircraft in history, before news emerged of the German Heinkel He 178&#x27;s first flight a year earlier.

During 1931, Italian aeronautics engineer Secondo Campini submitted his studies on jet propulsion, including a proposal for a so-called &quot;thermo-jet&quot; to power an aircraft. Following a high-profile demonstration of a jet-powered boat in Venice, Campini was rewarded with an initial contract issued by the Italian government to develop and manufacture his proposed engine. During 1934, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (the Italian Air Force) granted its approval to proceed with the production of two jet-powered prototype aircraft. To produce this aircraft, which was officially designated as the &quot;N.1&quot;, Campini formed an arrangement with the larger Caproni aviation manufacturer.

The N.1 is powered by a motorjet, a type of jet engine in which the compressor is driven by a conventional reciprocating engine. On 27 August 1940, the first flight of the N.1 took place at the Caproni facility in Taliedo, outside Milan, flown by Mario de Bernardi.

The N.1 achieved mixed results; while it was perceived and commended as a crucial milestone in aviation (until the revelation of the He 178&#x27;s earlier flight), the performance of the aircraft was unimpressive. It was slower than many existing conventional aircraft of the era, while the motorjet engine was incapable of producing sufficient thrust to deliver adequate performance for a fighter aircraft. As such, the N.1 programme never led to any operational combat aircraft, and the motorjet design was soon superseded by more powerful turbojets. Only one of the two examples of the N.1 to have been constructed has survived to the present day.

==Background==
During 1931, Italian aeronautics engineer Secondo Campini submitted a report to the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (the Italian Air Force) on the potential of jet propulsion; this report included his proposals for one such implementation, which he referred to as a &quot;thermo-jet&quot;. That same year, Campini established a company, with his two brothers, called the &quot;Velivoli e Natanti a Reazione&quot; (Italian for &quot;Jet Aircraft and Boats&quot;) to pursue the development of this engine. In April 1932, the company demonstrated a pump-jet propelled boat in Venice. The boat achieved a top speed of , a speed comparable to a boat with a conventional engine of similar output. The Italian Navy, who had funded the development of the boat, placed no orders and vetoed the sale of the design outside Italy.

During 1934, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; granted approval for the development of a pair of prototypes, along with a static testbed, for the purpose of demonstrating the principle of a jet aircraft, as well as to explore potential military applications. As his company lacked the necessary industrial infrastructure for such endeavours, Campini formed an arrangement with the larger Caproni aviation manufacturer, under which the latter provided the required material assistance for the manufacturing of the prototypes. Under this relationship, Campini developed his design, which later received the official Italian Air Force designation of &quot;N.1&quot;.

Historian Nathanial Edwards has contrasted the relative openness of Italian early jet development work against the high levels of secrecy present within other nation&#x27;s programmes, such as Britain and Germany. He speculated that this was due to desire of the Italian government to be perceived as possessing a modern and advanced aviation industry, being keen to acquire national prestige and renown for such achievements. Edwards went on to claim that the practicality of the N.1 design was undermined by political pressure to speed the programme along so that Italy would be more likely to be the first country in the world to perform a jet-powered flight.

==Design==

The Caproni Campini N.1 is an experimental aircraft, designed to demonstrate the practicality of jet propulsion and its viability as an engine for aircraft. It was a monoplane built entirely out of duralumin, with an elliptical wing. The original design was to have the aircraft cockpit pressurised but this facility was never installed. The aircraft was fitted with dual controls allowing it to be flow from either of the two seats. Both seats had individual rearward sliding canopies however, flight testing quickly revealed that, due to the excessive heat output of the propulsion system, the canopy had to be left permanently open as a mitigating measure.

The engine of the N.1 differs substantially from the later-produced turbojet and turbofan engines. One crucial difference in Campini&#x27;s design is that the compressor – a three-stage, variable-incidence one, located forward of the cockpit – was driven by a conventional piston engine, this being a , liquid-cooled Isotta Fraschini unit. The airflow provided by the compressor was used to cool the engine before being mixed with the engine&#x27;s exhaust gases, thus recovering most of the heat energy that in traditional piston-propeller designs would be wasted. A ring-shaped burner then injected fuel into the gas flow and ignited it, immediately before the exhaust nozzle, to further increase thrust.

In practice the engine provided enough thrust for flight without activating the rear burner, making the design somewhat similar to a ducted fan coupled to an afterburner. Campini referred to this configuration as being a &quot;thermojet&quot;, although it has since become commonly known as &quot;motorjet&quot;. The relatively small size of the duct limited the mass flow and thus the propulsive efficiency of the engine. In modern designs this is offset through high overall pressure ratios, which could not be achieved on the N.1, therefore resulting in relatively low thrust and poor fuel efficiency. Ground tests performed with the static testbed produced a thrust of around .

==Operational history==

The N.1&#x27;s first flight was made on 27 August 1940 by test pilot Mario De Bernardi at Caproni&#x27;s facility in Taliedo, outside Milan. He would conduct the majority of the N.1&#x27;s test flights. The first flight lasted ten minutes, during which de Bernardi kept the speed below , less than half throttle. 

Although the first flight of the jet-powered Heinkel He 178 had been made a year before to the day, it had not been made public, so the &quot;Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&quot; recorded the N.1 as the first successful flight by a jet aircraft.

Flight tests with the first prototype revealed several issues with the engine. It did not produce sufficient thrust to achieve the anticipated performance if it was matched to a strengthened airframe to withstand the high loading pressures. The engine generated considerable heat, which forced the pilot to fly with the canopy open throughout the flight, which although effectively venting the heat, increased drag. According to aviation author Sterling Michael Pavelec the N.1 was &quot;heavy and underpowered&quot; and the conventionally-powered Caproni Vizzola F.4 was faster which he attributed to limited national resources which left development programs underfunded. 
On 30 November 1941 the second prototype (Caproni construction No 4850) was flown by de Bernardi, with Giovanni Pedace as a passenger, from Milan&#x27;s Linate Airport to Rome&#x27;s Guidonia Airport. During the flight adverse weather caused a diversion and resulting in an unplanned flight over Pisa. On 5 December 1941, de Bernardi made a flight over central Rome following a request from Benito Mussolini. On 6 December 1941, Mussolini inspected the aircraft and watched de Bernardi demonstrate its capabilities.

Testing of the first Caproni Campini N.1 prototype (Caproni construction No 4849) by the Italian military took place from December 1941 to August 1942 with the aircraft receiving its military serial number (MM.487) on 30 December 1941. During the test program the aircraft was regularly shown off to foreign delegations. The last known flight by a Caproni Campini N.1 took place on the 27 August 1942. In June 1944, MM.487 was found by Allied forces in its hangar at Guidonia airport. The aircraft was badly damaged either from allied bombing raids or by the retreating Germans. The damaged prototype was transported to the United Kingdom for study at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in Farnborough. The aircraft was later scrapped at RAF Newton in 1949. The other example MM.448 (Caproni construction No 4850) survived the war in excellent condition. 

==Further developments==
A variant of the Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka, built in Japan towards the end of WW2, was powered by a Ishikawajima Tsu-11 motorjet based on Campini&#x27;s design. The Soviets were influenced by reports of the Campini Caproni N1 and developed the Kholshchevnikov VRDK motorjet engine which was used in the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-250 and the Sukhoi Su-5 aircraft. The Caproni company proposed a development of their Reggiane Re.2005 Sagittario single-seat fighter with the auxiliary 370 h.p. engine used to drive two centrifugal compressors. One compressor was to be used for supercharging the main Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine, and the auxiliary unit, while the second would be used to provide reaction propulsion.

==Surviving aircraft==

The surviving example is now on display at the Italian Air Force Museum at Vigna di Valle, near Rome, and the ground testbed, consisting of only the fuselage, is on display at the National Museum of Science and Technology in Milan.

<doc id="192309" wikidata="Q1331750" url="?curid=192309" title="Lake Pontchartrain">
<text>Lake Pontchartrain ( ; ) is an estuary located in southeastern Louisiana in the United States. It covers an area of with an average depth of . Some shipping channels are kept deeper through dredging. It is roughly oval in shape, about from west to east and from south to north.

In descending order of area, the lake is located in parts of six Louisiana parishes: St. Tammany, Orleans, Jefferson, St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, and Tangipahoa. The water boundaries were defined in 1979 (see list of parishes in Louisiana).

The lake is crossed by the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, the longest continuous bridge over water in the world. A power line also crosses the lake. Its towers stand on caissons in Lake Pontchartrain, and its length can be used to visually demonstrate the curvature of the Earth.

== Toponymy ==
Lake Pontchartrain was named for Louis Phélypeaux, Comte de Pontchartrain. He was the French Minister of the Marine, Chancellor, and Controller-General of Finances during the reign of France&#x27;s &quot;Sun King&quot;, Louis XIV, for whom the colony of La Louisiane was named.

The name Pontchartrain itself comes from the place in France where Phélypeaux&#x27;s château was situated. It is thought that this name originates from it being where a bridge () crossed the river Mauldre on the ancient route from Lutèce to Chartres ().

Lake Maurepas, directly west of Lake Pontchartrain, was named for Phélypeaux&#x27;s son, the Comte de Maurepas, who was also a French statesman.

== Description ==
Lake Pontchartrain is an estuary connected to the Gulf of Mexico via the Rigolets strait (known locally as &quot;the Rigolets&quot;) and Chef Menteur Pass into Lake Borgne, another large lagoon, and therefore experiences small tidal changes. It receives fresh water from the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, and Bogue Falaya rivers, and from Bayou Lacombe and Bayou Chinchuba. It is one of the largest wetlands along the Gulf Coast of North America. It comprises more than 125,000 acres of wetland, including bottomland hardwoods and cypress swamps (although these have been severely degraded by past logging), along with a complex mixture of herbaceous wetlands including fresh, intermediate, and brackish marsh. Lake Pontchartrain itself is part of the larger Pontchartrain Basin, a 10,000 square mile watershed that includes 16 Louisiana parishes and 4 Mississippi counties. The Basin is one of the largest estuarine systems of the Gulf of Mexico. The Pontchartrain Basin includes Lake Pontchartrain and the drainage area of its tributary streams, Lake Maurepas and the drainage area of its tributaries, The Rigolets, Lake Borgne, the Biloxi Marsh and Chandeleur Sound.

Salinity in Lake Pontchartrain varies from negligible at the northern cusp west of Mandeville up to nearly half the salinity of seawater at its eastern bulge near Interstate 10. Lake Maurepas, a true freshwater lake, connects with Lake Pontchartrain on the west via Pass Manchac. The Industrial Canal connects the Mississippi River with the lake at New Orleans. Bonnet Carré Spillway diverts water from the Mississippi into the lake during times of river flooding.

== History ==
The lake was formed 2,600 to 4,000 years ago as the evolving Mississippi River Delta formed its southern and eastern shorelines with alluvial deposits. 
Human habitation of the region began at least 3,500 years ago. One recorded Indigenous name for the lake is (&#x27;wide water&#x27;).

Habitation increased rapidly with the arrival of Europeans; in 1699, French explorer renamed the Lake after .

In 1777, the great American naturalist, William Bartram, explored the north shore during a trip west. 
In 1852, a railroad was constructed to link New Orleans to the north. Engines turned at Pass Manchac. However, the pilings were burned to the water line in the Civil War.

During the early 20th century, the great cypress swamps of the area were heavily logged and many have not regrown.

After over 30 years of oil drilling had yielded just 12 million barrels of oil and condensate and 119 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and caused major pollution of the lake, the State Mineral Board enacted a moratorium on oil drilling. As of 2009, there were 4 active wells continuing prior leases, and 25 derelict wells. According to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), they and the US Coast Guard see at least one oil spill per day in Louisiana&#x27;s wetlands. Estuarine wetlands are among the highest on the Environmental sensitivity Index (ESI).

==Conservation and restoration==
Owing to past exploitation, the ecosystems of the lake have been placed under stress. Marshes, for example, are turning to open water, and cypress swamps are being killed by saltwater intrusion. However, brown pelicans and bald eagles, once scarce, were a common sight along the shores as of 2004. A team of experts assembled by The Nature Conservancy assessed the situation in 2004 and identified seven target habitat types in particular need of conservation management: bottomland hardwood forest, cypress swamp, relict ridge woodland, fresh/intermediate marsh, brackish/salt marsh, lake open water, and littoral submersed aquatic vegetation. The bottomland hardwood forest and cypress swamp are suffering from a lack of freshwater input and sediment deposition owing to the levees upstream from the lake. In addition, bottomland hardwoods are being invaded by exotic species such as Chinese tallow, while freshwater marshes are being invaded by exotic species such as elephant&#x27;s-ear. The team identified four key animal species which could indicate the degree to which the system declines or improves. These were the rangia clam (representing lake bottom habitat), gulf sturgeon and paddlefish (representing fish communities), and the alligator snapping turtle (one of the largest freshwater turtles in the world, but in decline owing to over-harvesting).

The future of the lake depends, in part, on restoring annual spring floods to the wetlands of the lake basin and controlling urban sprawl on the north shore. Selected species, like the paddlefish and alligator snapping turtle, would benefit from reduced harvesting. The lake could change considerably without such conservation planning. As of 2007, a few examples of future change included more cypress swamps converting to anthropogenic marsh or open water, Chinese tallow displacing native forests, and, with a warming climate, mangrove trees replacing brackish marsh. Hence, the ecosystems of the lake now, and in the future, depend very much upon some basic decisions about human activities in the vicinity of the lake, and, even more so, human activity upstream along the Mississippi River.

As of 2006, the population in the region was over 1.5 million. There have been many problems with the conservation management of forests and wetlands. As of 1995, the United States Geological Survey was monitoring the environmental effects of shoreline erosion, loss of wetlands, pollution from urban areas and agriculture, saltwater intrusion from artificial waterways, dredging, basin subsidence and faulting, storms and sea level rise, and freshwater diversion from the Mississippi and other rivers. With proper management of this lake and its wetlands, there is great potential to enhance the productivity of wetlands, and to maintain biological diversity to support an ecotourism industry that will diversify the economy.

== Northshore ==
The area north of Lake Pontchartrain is known as the North Shore or the Northshore. It includes the cities of Mandeville, Covington, Abita Springs, Madisonville, Pearl River, Lacombe, and Slidell in St. Tammany Parish; Ponchatoula, Hammond, Amite, and Kentwood in Tangipahoa Parish; and Bogalusa and Franklinton in Washington Parish.

These three Northshore parishes are the eastern Florida Parishes. The landscape here is mostly uplands that were once dominated by long leaf pine savannas and interrupted by occasional large rivers. The savannas were maintained by regular fires caused by lightning; they produced the distinctive fauna and flora of this region.
Lake Pontchartrain&#x27;s south shore areas (dominated by New Orleans), instead of being designated by that name, are more likely to be referred to as either &quot;East bank&quot; or &quot;West bank,&quot; depending upon their position with respect to the general north–south course of the Mississippi River. Lake Pontchartrain forms the northern boundary of the city of New Orleans, which is coterminous with Orleans Parish, and the northern boundary of its two largest suburbs, Metairie and Kenner; as well as forming the northern boundaries of Jefferson Parish and Saint Charles Parish, and much of the northern and eastern boundaries of Saint John the Baptist Parish.

== New Orleans ==
New Orleans was established at a Native American portage between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain. The lake provides numerous recreational activities for people in New Orleans and is also home to the Southern Yacht Club. In the 1920s, the Industrial Canal in the eastern part of the city opened, providing a direct navigable water connection, with locks, between the Mississippi River and the lake. In the same decade, a project dredging new land from the lake shore behind a new concrete floodwall began; this would result in an expansion of the city into the former swamp between Metairie/Gentilly Ridges and the lakefront. The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, connecting New Orleans (by way of Metairie) with Mandeville, and bisecting the lake in a north-northeast line.

== Hurricanes ==

During hurricanes, a storm surge can build up in Lake Pontchartrain. Wind pushes water into the lake from the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane approaches from the south, and from there it can spill into New Orleans.

A hurricane in 1947 flooded much of Metairie, much of which is slightly below sea level due to land subsidence after marshland was drained. After the storm, hurricane-protection levees were built along Lake Pontchartrain&#x27;s south shore to protect New Orleans and nearby communities. A storm surge of from Hurricane Betsy overwhelmed some levees in eastern New Orleans in 1965, while a storm surge funneled in by the Mississippi River–Gulf Outlet Canal and a levee failure flooded most of the Lower 9th Ward. After this the levees encircling the city and outlying parishes were raised to heights of . Due to cost concerns, the levees were built to protect against only a Category 3 hurricane; however, some of the levees initially withstood the Category 5 storm surge of Hurricane Katrina (August 2005), which only slowed to Category 3 winds within hours of landfall (due to a last-minute eyewall replacement cycle).

Experts using computer modeling at Louisiana State University after Hurricane Katrina have concluded that the levees were never topped but rather faulty design, inadequate construction, or some combination of the two were responsible for the flooding of most of New Orleans. Some canal walls leaked underneath because the wall foundations were not deep enough in peat-subsoil to withstand the pressure of higher water.

=== Funding ===
Congress failed to fully fund an upgrade requested during the 1990s by the Army Corps of Engineers, and funding was cut in 2003–04 despite a 2001 study by the Federal Emergency Management Agency warning that a hurricane in New Orleans was one of the country&#x27;s three most likely disasters. Raising and reinforcing the levees to resist a Category 5 hurricane might take 25 years to complete. Some estimates place the cost at $25 billion.

=== Hurricane Katrina ===


When Hurricane Katrina reached Category 5 in 2005, some experts predicted that the levee system might fail completely if the storm passed close to the city. Although Katrina weakened to a Category 3 before making landfall on August 29 (with only Category 1-2 strength winds in New Orleans on the weaker side of the eye of the hurricane), the outlying New Orleans East area along south Lake Pontchartrain was in the eyewall with winds, preceding the eye, nearly as strong as those experienced in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. Canals near Chalmette began leaking at 8 am, and some levees/canals, designed to withstand Category 3 storms, suffered multiple breaks the following day (see Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans), flooding 80% of the city.

The walls of the Industrial Canal were breached by storm surge via the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, while the 17th Street Canal and London Avenue Canal experienced catastrophic breaches, even though water levels never topped their flood walls. Louisiana State University experts presented evidence that some of these structures might have had design flaws or faulty construction.

There are indications that the soft earth and peat underlying canal walls may have given way. In the weeks before Katrina, tests of salinity in seepage pools near canals showed them to be lake water, not fresh water from broken mains. The I-10 Twin Span Bridge heading northeast between New Orleans and Slidell was destroyed. The shorter Fort Pike Bridge crossing the outlet to Lake Borgne remained intact.

Much of the northern sector of the suburban areas of Metairie and Kenner was flooded with up to of water. In this area, flooding was not the result of levee overtopping but was due to a decision by the governmental administration of Jefferson Parish to abandon the levee-aligned drainage pumping stations. This resulted in the reverse flow of lake water through the pumping stations into drainage canals which subsequently overflowed, causing extensive flooding of the area between I-10 and the lakefront. When the pump operators were returned to their stations, water was drained out of Metairie and Kenner in less than a day.
On September 5, 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers started to fix levee breaches by dropping huge sandbags from Chinook helicopters. The London Avenue Canal and Industrial Canal were blocked at the lake as permanent repairs started. On September 6, the Corps began pumping flood water back into the lake after seven days in the streets of New Orleans. Because it was fouled with dead animals, sewage, heavy metals, petrochemicals, and other dangerous substances, the Army Corps worked with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) to avoid major contamination and eutrophication of the lake.

Aerial photography suggests that of water covered New Orleans as of September 2, which equals about 2% of Lake Pontchartrain&#x27;s volume. Due to a lack of electric power, the city was unable to treat the water before pumping it into the lake. It is unclear how long the pollution will persist and what its environmental damage to the lake will be, or what the long-term health effects will be in the city from mold and other contamination.

On September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita did not breach the temporary repairs in the main part of the city, but the repair on the Industrial Canal wall in the Lower 9th Ward was breached, allowing about of water back into that neighborhood.

== Notable deaths ==
* Eastern Air Lines Flight 304 crashed into the lake on February 25, 1964, resulting in the deaths of 51 passengers and 7 crew.
* On June 16, 1964, a Trailways bus plunged off the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway into Lake Pontchartrain, killing 6.
* On December 31, 1967, a chartered plane crashed into Lake Pontchartrain, killing 5 servicemen and the pilot.
* On September 15, 1978, six-year-old Benjamin Daly, along with the pilot, died when a private plane his parents had chartered crashed into the lake. His parents survived.
* On February 23, 1980, a twin-engine plane crashed into Lake Pontchartrain, killing 7.
* On January 15, 1981, a Piper PA-23 flying in heavy fog crashed into Lake Pontchartrain while on final approach to New Orleans Lakefront Airport, killing the plane&#x27;s owner and pilot Joyce W. Hornady, the 73-year-old CEO of Hornady Manufacturing Company, and two other company employees Edward A. Heers, a 34-year-old engineer, and James W. Garber, a 29-year-old customer service manager. All three men were due to attend and represent their company in the 1981 SHOT Show in New Orleans.
* In 1986, a decomposing woman&#x27;s body was found by two fishermen. The cause of death was homicide by asphyxia. She was not identified and no leads were ever identified in the case.
* New England Patriots defensive end, New Orleans native, and former LSU star Marquise Hill was found dead in Lake Pontchartrain on May 28, 2007.
* A U.S. Navy T-34 training plane crashed into the lake on January 23, 2010, after a routine training mission. The instructor, LT Clinton Wermers, was found dead at 0100 on January 27, 2010. The student pilot was rescued about two hours after the crash.

<doc id="192314" wikidata="Q234731" url="?curid=192314" title="Torii">
<text>A is a traditional Japanese gate most commonly found at the entrance of or within a Shinto shrine, where it symbolically marks the transition from the mundane to the sacred, and a spot where kami are welcomed and thought to travel through.

The presence of a &quot;torii&quot; at the entrance is usually the simplest way to identify Shinto shrines, and a small &quot;torii&quot; icon represents them on Japanese road maps and on Google Maps.

The first appearance of &quot;torii&quot; gates in Japan can be reliably pinpointed to at least the mid-Heian period; they are mentioned in a text written in 922. The oldest existing stone &quot;torii&quot; was built in the 12th century and belongs to a Hachiman shrine in Yamagata Prefecture. The oldest existing wooden &quot;torii&quot; is a &quot;ryōbu torii&quot; (see description below) at Kubō Hachiman Shrine in Yamanashi Prefecture built in 1535.

&quot;Torii&quot; gates were traditionally made from wood or stone, but today they can be also made of reinforced concrete, stainless steel or other materials. They are usually either unpainted or painted vermilion with a black upper lintel. Shrines of Inari, the &quot;kami&quot; of fertility and industry, typically have many &quot;torii&quot; because those who have been successful in business often donate &quot;torii&quot; in gratitude. Fushimi Inari-taisha in Kyoto has thousands of such &quot;torii&quot;, each bearing the donor&#x27;s name.

==Uses==
The function of a &quot;torii&quot; is to mark the entrance to a sacred space. For this reason, the road leading to a Shinto shrine (&quot;sandō&quot;) is almost always straddled by one or more &quot;torii&quot;, which are therefore the easiest way to distinguish a shrine from a Buddhist temple. If the &quot;sandō&quot; passes under multiple &quot;torii&quot;, the outer of them is called . The following ones, closer to the shrine, are usually called, in order, and . Other &quot;torii&quot; can be found farther into the shrine to represent increasing levels of holiness as one nears the inner sanctuary (), core of the shrine. Also, because of the strong relationship between Shinto shrines and the Japanese Imperial family, a &quot;torii&quot; stands also in front of the tomb of each Emperor.

In the past &quot;torii&quot; must have been used also at the entrance of Buddhist temples. Even today, as prominent a temple as Osaka&#x27;s Shitennō-ji, founded in 593 by Shōtoku Taishi and the oldest state-built Buddhist temple in the country (and world), has a &quot;torii&quot; straddling one of its entrances. (The original wooden &quot;torii&quot; burned in 1294 and was then replaced by one in stone.) Many Buddhist temples include one or more Shinto shrines dedicated to their tutelary &quot;kami &quot;(&quot;Chinjusha&quot;), and in that case a &quot;torii&quot; marks the shrine&#x27;s entrance. Benzaiten is a syncretic goddess derived from the Indian divinity Sarasvati, who unites elements of both Shinto and Buddhism. For this reason halls dedicated to her can be found at both temples and shrines, and in either case in front of the hall stands a &quot;torii&quot;. The goddess herself is sometimes portrayed with a &quot;torii&quot; on her head.
Finally, until the Meiji period (1868–1912) &quot;torii&quot; were routinely adorned with plaques carrying Buddhist sutras.

&quot;Yamabushi&quot;, Japanese mountain ascetic hermits with a long tradition as mighty warriors endowed with supernatural powers, sometimes use as their symbol a &quot;torii&quot;.

The &quot;torii&quot; is also sometimes used as a symbol of Japan in non-religious contexts. For example, it is the symbol of the Marine Corps Security Force Regiment and the 187th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division and of other US forces in Japan. It is also used as a fixture at the entrance of some Japantown communities, such as Liberdade in São Paulo.

==Origins==
The origins of the &quot;torii&quot; are unknown and there are several different theories on the subject, none of which has gained universal acceptance. Because the use of symbolic gates is widespread in Asia—such structures can be found for example in India, China, Thailand, Korea, and within Nicobarese and Shompen villages—many historians believe they may be an imported tradition.

They may, for example, have originated in India from the &quot;torana&quot; gates in the monastery of Sanchi in central India. According to this theory, the &quot;torana&quot; was adopted by Shingon Buddhism founder Kūkai, who used it to demarcate the sacred space used for the homa ceremony. The hypothesis arose in the 19th and 20th centuries due to similarities in structure and name between the two gates. Linguistic and historical objections have now emerged, but no conclusion has yet been reached.

In Bangkok, Thailand, a Brahmin structure called Sao Ching Cha strongly resembles a &quot;torii&quot;. Functionally, however, it is very different as it is used as a swing. that was constructed in 1784 in front of the Devasathan shrine by King Rama I. During the reign of Rama II the swing ceremony was discontinued as the swing had become structurally damaged by lightning.

Other theories claim &quot;torii&quot; may be related to the &quot;pailou&quot; of China. These structures however can assume a great variety of forms, only some of which actually somewhat resemble a &quot;torii&quot;. The same goes for Korea&#x27;s hongsalmun. Unlike its Chinese counterpart, the hongsal-mun does not vary greatly in design and is always painted red, with &quot;arrowsticks&quot; located on the top of the structure (hence the name).

Various tentative etymologies of the word &quot;torii&quot; exist. According to one of them, the name derives from the term .

Another hypothesis takes the name literally: the gate would originally have been some kind of bird perch. This is based on the religious use of bird perches in Asia, such as the Korean &quot;sotdae&quot; (솟대), which are poles with one or more wooden birds resting on their top. Commonly found in groups at the entrance of villages together with totem poles called &quot;jangseung&quot;, they are talismans which ward off evil spirits and bring the villagers good luck. &quot;Bird perches&quot; similar in form and function to the &quot;sotdae&quot; exist also in other shamanistic cultures in China, Mongolia and Siberia. Although they do not look like &quot;torii&quot; and serve a different function, these &quot;bird perches&quot; show how birds in several Asian cultures are believed to have magic or spiritual properties, and may therefore help explain the enigmatic literal meaning of the &quot;torii&#x27;s&quot; name (&quot;bird perch&quot;).

Poles believed to have supported wooden bird figures very similar to the &quot;sotdae&quot; have been found together with wooden birds, and are believed by some historians to have somehow evolved into today&#x27;s &quot;torii&quot;. Intriguingly, in both Korea and Japan single poles represent deities (&quot;kami&quot; in the case of Japan) and is the counter for &quot;kami&quot;.

In Japan birds have also long had a connection with the dead, this may mean it was born in connection with some prehistorical funerary rite. Ancient Japanese texts like the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki for example mention how Yamato Takeru after his death became a white bird and in that form chose a place for his own burial. For this reason, his mausoleum was then called . Many later texts also show some relationship between dead souls and white birds, a link common also in other cultures, shamanic like the Japanese. Bird motifs from the Yayoi and Kofun periods associating birds with the dead have also been found in several archeological sites. This relationship between birds and death would also explain why, in spite of their name, no visible trace of birds remains in today&#x27;s &quot;torii&quot;: birds were symbols of death, which in Shinto brings defilement (&quot;kegare&quot;).

Finally, the possibility that &quot;torii&quot; are a Japanese invention cannot be discounted. The first &quot;torii&quot; could have evolved already with their present function through the following sequence of events:

* Four posts were placed at the corners of a sacred area and connected with a rope, thus dividing sacred and mundane.
* Two taller posts were then placed at the center of the most auspicious direction, to let the priest in.
* A rope was tied from one post to the other to mark the border between the outside and the inside, the sacred and the mundane. This hypothetical stage corresponds to a type of &quot;torii&quot; in actual use, the so-called , an example of which can be seen in front of Ōmiwa Shrine&#x27;s &quot;haiden&quot; in &quot;Nara&quot; (see also the photo in the gallery).
* The rope was replaced by a lintel.
* Because the gate was structurally weak, it was reinforced with a tie-beam, and what is today called or (see illustration at right) was born. This theory however does nothing to explain how the gates got their name.

The &quot;shinmei torii&quot;, whose structure agrees with the historians&#x27; reconstruction, consists of just four unbarked and unpainted logs: two vertical pillars () topped by a horizontal lintel () and kept together by a tie-beam (). The pillars may have a slight inward inclination called or just . Its parts are always straight.

==Parts and ornamentations==
*&quot;Torii&quot; may be unpainted or painted vermilion and black. The color black is limited to the &quot;kasagi&quot; and the . Very rarely &quot;torii&quot; can be found also in other colors. Kamakura&#x27;s Kamakura-gū for example has a white and red one.
* The &quot;kasagi&quot; may be reinforced underneath by a second horizontal lintel called .
* &quot;Kasagi&quot; and the &quot;shimaki&quot; may have an upward curve called .
* The &quot;nuki&quot; is often held in place by wedges (). The &quot;kusabi&quot; in many cases are purely ornamental.
* At the center of the &quot;nuki&quot; there may be a supporting strut called , sometimes covered by a tablet carrying the name of the shrine (see photo in the gallery).
*The pillars often rest on a white stone ring called or . The stone is sometimes replaced by a decorative black sleeve called .
* At the top of the pillars there may be a decorative ring called .
* The gate has a purely symbolic function and therefore there usually are no doors or board fences, but exceptions exist, as for example in the case of Ōmiwa Shrine&#x27;s triple-arched &quot;torii&quot; (&quot;miwa torii&quot;, see below).

==Styles==
Structurally, the simplest is the (see illustration below). Probably one of the oldest types of torii, it consists of two posts with a sacred rope called &quot;shimenawa&quot; tied between them.

All other &quot;torii&quot; can be divided in two families, the and the . &quot;Torii&quot; of the first have only straight parts, the second have both straight and curved parts.

===&quot;Shinmei&quot; family===
The &quot;shinmei torii&quot; and its variants are characterized by straight upper lintels.

====Photo gallery====
====&quot;Shinmei torii&quot;====
The , which gives the name to the family, is constituted solely by a lintel (&quot;kasagi&quot;) and two pillars (&quot;hashira&quot;) united by a tie beam (&quot;nuki&quot;). In its simplest form, all four elements are rounded and the pillars have no inclination. When the &quot;nuki&quot; is rectangular in section, it is called &quot;Yasukuni torii&quot;, from Tokyo&#x27;s Yasukuni Jinja. It is believed to be the oldest &quot;torii&quot; style.

====&quot;Ise torii&quot;====
 (see illustration above) are gates found only at the Inner Shrine and Outer Shrine at Ise Shrine in Mie Prefecture. For this reason, they are also called &quot;Jingū torii&quot;, from Jingū, Ise Grand Shrine&#x27;s official Japanese name.

There are two variants. The most common is extremely similar to a &quot;shinmei torii&quot;, its pillars however have a slight inward inclination and its &quot;nuki&quot; is kept in place by wedges (&quot;kusabi&quot;). The &quot;kasagi&quot; is pentagonal in section (see illustration in the gallery below). The ends of the &quot;kasagi&quot; are slightly thicker, giving the impression of an upward slant. All these &quot;torii&quot; were built after the 14th century.

The second type is similar to the first, but has also a secondary, rectangular lintel (&quot;shimaki&quot;) under the pentagonal &quot;kasagi&quot;.

This and the &quot;shinmei torii&quot; style started becoming more popular during the early 20th century at the time of State Shinto because they were considered the oldest and most prestigious.

====&quot;Kasuga torii&quot;====
The is a &quot;myōjin torii&quot; (see illustration above) with straight top lintels. The style takes its name from Kasuga-taisha&#x27;s , or main &quot;torii&quot;.

The pillars have an inclination and are slightly tapered. The &quot;nuki&quot; protrudes and is held in place by &quot;kusabi&quot; driven in on both sides.

This &quot;torii&quot; was the first to be painted vermilion and to adopt a &quot;shimaki&quot; at Kasuga Taisha, the shrine from which it takes its name.

====&quot;Hachiman torii&quot;====
Almost identical to a &quot;kasuga torii&quot; (see illustration above), but with the two upper lintels at a slant, the first appeared during the Heian period. The name comes from the fact that this type of &quot;torii&quot; is often used at Hachiman shrines.

====&quot;Kashima torii&quot;====
The (see illustration above) is a &quot;shinmei torii&quot; without &quot;korobi&quot;, with &quot;kusabi&quot; and a protruding nuki. It takes its name from Kashima Shrine in Ibaraki Prefecture.

====&quot;Kuroki torii&quot;====
The is a &quot;shinmei torii&quot; built with unbarked wood. Because this type of &quot;torii&quot; requires replacement at three years intervals, it is becoming rare. The most notorious example is Nonomiya Shrine in Kyoto. The shrine now however uses a &quot;torii&quot; made of synthetic material which simulates the look of wood.

====&quot;Shiromaruta torii&quot;====
The or is a &quot;shinmei torii&quot; made with logs from which bark has been removed. This type of &quot;torii&quot; is present at the tombs of all Emperors of Japan.

====&quot;Mihashira torii&quot;====
The (see illustration above) is a type of &quot;torii&quot; which appears to be formed from three individual &quot;torii&quot; (see gallery). It is thought by some to have been built by early Japanese Christians to represent the Holy Trinity.

===&quot;Myōjin&quot; family===
The &quot;Myōjin torii&quot; and its variants are characterized by curved lintels.

====Photo gallery====
====&quot;Myōjin torii&quot;====
The , by far the most common &quot;torii&quot; style, are characterized by curved upper lintels (&quot;kasagi&quot; and &quot;shimaki&quot;). Both curve slightly upwards. Kusabi are present. A &quot;myōjin torii&quot; can be made of wood, stone, concrete or other materials and be vermilion or unpainted.

====&quot;Nakayama torii&quot;====
The style, which takes its name from Nakayama Jinja in Okayama Prefecture, is basically a &quot;myōjin torii&quot;, but the &quot;nuki&quot; does not protrude from the pillars and the curve made by the two top lintels is more accentuated than usual. The &quot;torii&quot; at Nakayama Shrine that gives the style its name is 9 m tall and was erected in 1791.

====&quot;Daiwa/Inari torii&quot;====
The (see illustration above) is a &quot;myōjin torii&quot; with two rings called &quot;daiwa&quot; at the top of the two pillars. The name &quot;Inari torii&quot; comes from the fact that vermilion &quot;daiwa torii&quot; tend to be common at Inari shrines, but even at the famous Fushimi Inari Shrine not all &quot;torii&quot; are in this style. This style first appeared during the late Heian period.

====&quot;Sannō torii&quot;====
The (see photo below) is &quot;myōjin torii&quot; with a gable over the two top lintels. The best example of this style is found at Hiyoshi Shrine near Lake Biwa.

====&quot;Miwa torii&quot;====
Also called , or (see illustration above), the is composed of three &quot;myōjin torii&quot; without inclination of the pillars. It can be found with or without doors. The most famous one is at Ōmiwa Shrine, in Nara, from which it takes its name.

====&quot;Ryōbu torii&quot;====
Also called , or , the is a &quot;daiwa torii&quot; whose pillars are reinforced on both sides by square posts (see illustration above). The name derives from its long association with Ryōbu Shintō, a current of thought within Shingon Buddhism. The famous &quot;torii&quot; rising from the water at Itsukushima is a &quot;ryōbu torii&quot;, and the shrine used to be also a Shingon Buddhist temple, so much so that it still has a pagoda.

====&quot;Hizen torii&quot;====
The is an unusual type of torii with a rounded &quot;kasagi&quot; and pillars that flare downwards. They are found only in Saga prefecture and the neighboring areas.

<text>Reverberation (commonly shortened to reverb), in acoustics, is a persistence of sound after it is produced. Reverberation is created when a sound or signal is reflected. This causes numerous reflections to build up and then decay as the sound is absorbed by the surfaces of objects in the space – which could include furniture, people, and air. This is most noticeable when the sound source stops but the reflections continue, their amplitude decreasing, until zero is reached.

Reverberation is frequency dependent: the length of the decay, or reverberation time, receives special consideration in the architectural design of spaces which need to have specific reverberation times to achieve optimum performance for their intended activity. In comparison to a distinct echo, that is detectable at a minimum of 50 to 100 ms after the previous sound, reverberation is the occurrence of reflections that arrive in a sequence of less than approximately 50 ms. As time passes, the amplitude of the reflections gradually reduces to non-noticeable levels. Reverberation is not limited to indoor spaces as it exists in forests and other outdoor environments where reflection exists.

Reverberation occurs naturally when a person sings, talks, or plays an instrument acoustically in a hall or performance space with sound-reflective surfaces. Reverberation is applied artificially by using reverb effects, which simulate reverb through means including echo chambers, vibrations sent through metal, and digital processing.

Although reverberation can add naturalness to recorded sound by adding a sense of space, it can also reduce speech intelligibility, especially when noise is also present. People with hearing loss, including users of hearing aids, frequently report difficulty in understanding speech in reverberant, noisy situations. Reverberation is also a significant source of mistakes in automatic speech recognition.

&quot;Dereverberation&quot; is the process of reducing the level of reverberation in a sound or signal.

Reverberation time is a measure of the time required for the sound to &quot;fade away&quot; in an enclosed area after the source of the sound has stopped.

When it comes to accurately measuring reverberation time with a meter, the term &quot;T60&quot; (an abbreviation for reverberation time 60 dB) is used. T60 provides an objective reverberation time measurement. It is defined as the time it takes for the sound pressure level to reduce by 60 dB, measured after the generated test signal is abruptly ended.

Reverberation time is frequently stated as a single value if measured as a wideband signal (20  Hz to 20 kHz). However, being frequency-dependent, it can be more precisely described in terms of frequency bands (one octave, 1/3 octave, 1/6 octave, etc.). Being frequency dependent, the reverberation time measured in narrow bands will differ depending on the frequency band being measured. For precision, it is important to know what ranges of frequencies are being described by a reverberation time measurement.

In the late 19th century, Wallace Clement Sabine started experiments at Harvard University to investigate the impact of absorption on the reverberation time. Using a portable wind chest and organ pipes as a sound source, a stopwatch and his ears, he measured the time from interruption of the source to inaudibility (a difference of roughly 60 dB). He found that the reverberation time is proportional to room dimensions and inversely proportional to the amount of absorption present.

The optimum reverberation time for a space in which music is played depends on the type of music that is to be played in the space. Rooms used for speech typically need a shorter reverberation time so that speech can be understood more clearly. If the reflected sound from one syllable is still heard when the next syllable is spoken, it may be difficult to understand what was said. &quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;cab&quot;, and &quot;cap&quot; may all sound very similar. If on the other hand the reverberation time is too short, tonal balance and loudness may suffer. Reverberation effects are often used in studios to add depth to sounds. Reverberation changes the perceived spectral structure of a sound but does not alter the pitch.

Basic factors that affect a room&#x27;s reverberation time include the size and shape of the enclosure as well as the materials used in the construction of the room. Every object placed within the enclosure can also affect this reverberation time, including people and their belongings.

=== Measurement ===
Historically, reverberation time could only be measured using a level recorder (a plotting device which graphs the noise level against time on a ribbon of moving paper). A loud noise is produced, and as the sound dies away the trace on the level recorder will show a distinct slope. Analysis of this slope reveals the measured reverberation time. Some modern digital sound level meters can carry out this analysis automatically.

Several methods exist for measuring reverberation time. An impulse can be measured by creating a sufficiently loud noise (which must have a defined cut-off point). Impulse noise sources such as a blank pistol shot or balloon burst may be used to measure the impulse response of a room.

Alternatively, a random noise signal such as pink noise or white noise may be generated through a loudspeaker, and then turned off. This is known as the interrupted method, and the measured result is known as the interrupted response.

A two-port measurement system can also be used to measure noise introduced into a space and compare it to what is subsequently measured in the space. Consider sound reproduced by a loudspeaker into a room. A recording of the sound in the room can be made and compared to what was sent to the loudspeaker. The two signals can be compared mathematically. This two port measurement system utilizes a Fourier transform to mathematically derive the impulse response of the room. From the impulse response, the reverberation time can be calculated. Using a two-port system allows reverberation time to be measured with signals other than loud impulses. Music or recordings of other sounds can be used. This allows measurements to be taken in a room after the audience is present.

Under some restrictions, even simple sound sources like handclaps can be used for measurement of reverberation 

Reverberation time is usually stated as a decay time and is measured in seconds. There may or may not be any statement of the frequency band used in the measurement. Decay time is the time it takes the signal to diminish 60 dB below the original sound. It is often difficult to inject enough sound into the room to measure a decay of 60 dB, particularly at lower frequencies. If the decay is linear, it is sufficient to measure a drop of 20 dB and multiply the time by 3, or a drop of 30 dB and multiply the time by 2. These are the so-called T20 and T30 measurement methods.

The RT60 reverberation time measurement is defined in the ISO 3382-1 standard for performance spaces, the ISO 3382-2 standard for ordinary rooms, and the ISO 3382-3 for open-plan offices, as well as the ASTM E2235 standard.

The concept of reverberation time implicitly supposes that the decay rate of the sound is exponential, so that the sound level diminishes regularly, at a rate of so many dB per second. It is not often the case in real rooms, depending on the disposition of reflective, dispersive and absorbing surfaces. Moreover, successive measurement of the sound level often yields very different results, as differences in phase in the exciting sound build up in notably different sound waves. In 1965, Manfred R. Schroeder published &quot;A new method of Measuring Reverberation Time&quot; in the &quot;Journal of the Acoustical Society of America&quot;. He proposed to measure, not the power of the sound, but the energy, by integrating it. This made it possible to show the variation in the rate of decay and to free acousticians from the necessity of averaging many measurements.

=== Sabine equation ===
Sabine&#x27;s reverberation equation was developed in the late 1890s in an empirical fashion. He established a relationship between the &quot;T&quot;60 of a room, its volume, and its total absorption (in sabins). This is given by the equation:

:formula_1.

where &quot;c&quot;20 is the speed of sound in the room (at 20 °C), &quot;V&quot; is the volume of the room in m3, &quot;S&quot; total surface area of room in m2, &quot;a&quot; is the average absorption coefficient of room surfaces, and the product &quot;Sa&quot; is the total absorption in sabins.

The total absorption in sabins (and hence reverberation time) generally changes depending on frequency (which is defined by the acoustic properties of the space). The equation does not take into account room shape or losses from the sound traveling through the air (important in larger spaces). Most rooms absorb less sound energy in the lower frequency ranges resulting in longer reverb times at lower frequencies.

Sabine concluded that the reverberation time depends upon the reflectivity of sound from various surfaces available inside the hall. If the reflection is coherent, the reverberation time of the hall will be longer; the sound will take more time to die out.

The reverberation time &quot;RT&quot;60 and the volume &quot;V&quot; of the room have great influence on the critical distance &quot;d&quot;c (conditional equation):
:formula_2

where critical distance formula_3 is measured in meters, volume formula_4 is measured in m³, and reverberation time &quot;RT&quot;60 is measured in seconds.

=== Eyring equation ===
Eyring&#x27;s reverberation time equation was proposed by Carl F. Eyring of Bell Labs in 1930. This equation aims to better estimate the reverberation time in small rooms with relatively large quantities of sound absorption, identified by Eyring as &quot;dead&quot; rooms. These rooms tend to have lower reverberation times than larger, more acoustically live rooms. Eyring&#x27;s equation is similar in form to Sabine&#x27;s equation, but includes modifications to logarithmically scale the absorption term. The units and variables within the equation are the same as those defined for Sabine&#x27;s equation. The Eyring reverberation time is given by the equation:

:formula_5.

Eyring&#x27;s equation was developed from first principles using an image source model of sound reflection, as opposed to Sabine&#x27;s empirical approach. The experimental results obtained by Sabine generally agree with Eyring&#x27;s equation since the two formulae become identical for very live rooms, the type in which Sabine worked. However, Eyring&#x27;s equation becomes more valid for smaller rooms with large quantities of absorption. As a result, the Eyring equation is often implemented to estimate the reverberation time in recording studio control rooms or other critical listening environments with high quantities of sound absorption. The Sabine equation tends to over-predict reverberation time for small rooms with high amounts of absorption. For this reason, reverberation time calculators available for smaller recording studio environments, such as home recording studios, often utilize Eyring&#x27;s equation.

=== Absorption coefficient ===
The absorption coefficient of a material is a number between 0 and 1 which indicates the proportion of sound which is absorbed by the surface compared to the proportion which is reflected back to the room. A large, fully open window would offer no reflection as any sound reaching it would pass straight out and no sound would be reflected. This would have an absorption coefficient of 1. Conversely, a thick, smooth painted concrete ceiling would be the acoustic equivalent of a mirror and have an absorption coefficient very close to 0.

== In music ==

&quot;The Atlantic&quot; described reverberation as &quot;arguably the oldest and most universal sound effect in music&quot;, used in music as early as 10th-century plainsong. Composers including Bach wrote music to exploit the acoustics of certain buildings. Gregorian chant may have developed in response to the long reverberation time of cathedrals, limiting the number of notes that could be sung before blending chaotically.

Artificial reverberation is applied to sound using reverb effects. These simulate reverb through means including echo chambers, vibrations sent through metal, and digital processing.

<doc id="192316" wikidata="Q849940" url="?curid=192316" title="Virtual particle">
<text>A virtual particle is a theoretical transient particle that exhibits some of the characteristics of an ordinary particle, while having its existence limited by the uncertainty principle, which allows the virtual particles to spontaneously emerge from vacuum at short time and space ranges. The concept of virtual particles arises in the perturbation theory of quantum field theory (QFT) where interactions between ordinary particles are described in terms of exchanges of virtual particles. A process involving virtual particles can be described by a schematic representation known as a Feynman diagram, in which virtual particles are represented by internal lines.

Virtual particles do not necessarily carry the same mass as the corresponding ordinary particle, although they always conserve energy and momentum. The closer its characteristics come to those of ordinary particles, the longer the virtual particle exists. They are important in the physics of many processes, including particle scattering and Casimir forces. In quantum field theory, forces—such as the electromagnetic repulsion or attraction between two charges—can be thought of as resulting from the exchange of virtual photons between the charges. Virtual photons are the exchange particles for the electromagnetic interaction.

The term is somewhat loose and vaguely defined, in that it refers to the view that the world is made up of &quot;real particles&quot;. &quot;Real particles&quot; are better understood to be excitations of the underlying quantum fields. Virtual particles are also excitations of the underlying fields, but are &quot;temporary&quot; in the sense that they appear in calculations of interactions, but never as asymptotic states or indices to the scattering matrix. The accuracy and use of virtual particles in calculations is firmly established, but as they cannot be detected in experiments, deciding how to precisely describe them is a topic of debate. Although widely used, they are by no means a necessary feature of QFT, but rather are mathematical conveniences — as demonstrated by lattice field theory, which avoids using the concept altogether.

== Properties ==
The concept of virtual particles arises in the perturbation theory of quantum field theory, an approximation scheme in which interactions (in essence, forces) between actual particles are calculated in terms of exchanges of virtual particles. Such calculations are often performed using schematic representations known as Feynman diagrams, in which virtual particles appear as internal lines. By expressing the interaction in terms of the exchange of a virtual particle with four-momentum , where is given by the difference between the four-momenta of the particles entering and leaving the interaction vertex, &quot;both momentum and energy are conserved at the interaction vertices&quot; of the Feynman diagram.

A virtual particle does not precisely obey the energy–momentum relation . Its kinetic energy may not have the usual relationship to velocity. It can be negative. This is expressed by the phrase &quot;off mass shell&quot;. The probability amplitude for a virtual particle to exist tends to be canceled out by destructive interference over longer distances and times. As a consequence, a real photon is massless and thus has only two polarization states, whereas a virtual one, being effectively massive, has three polarization states.

Quantum tunnelling may be considered a manifestation of virtual particle exchanges. The range of forces carried by virtual particles is limited by the uncertainty principle, which regards energy and time as conjugate variables; thus, virtual particles of larger mass have more limited range.

Written in the usual mathematical notations, in the equations of physics, there is no mark of the distinction between virtual and actual particles. The amplitudes of processes with a virtual particle interfere with the amplitudes of processes without it, whereas for an actual particle the cases of existence and non-existence cease to be coherent with each other and do not interfere any more. In the quantum field theory view, actual particles are viewed as being detectable excitations of underlying quantum fields. Virtual particles are also viewed as excitations of the underlying fields, but appear only as forces, not as detectable particles. They are &quot;temporary&quot; in the sense that they appear in some calculations, but are not detected as single particles. Thus, in mathematical terms, they never appear as indices to the scattering matrix, which is to say, they never appear as the observable inputs and outputs of the physical process being modelled.

There are two principal ways in which the notion of virtual particles appears in modern physics. They appear as intermediate terms in Feynman diagrams; that is, as terms in a perturbative calculation. They also appear as an infinite set of states to be summed or integrated over in the calculation of a semi-non-perturbative effect. In the latter case, it is sometimes said that virtual particles contribute to a mechanism that mediates the effect, or that the effect occurs through the virtual particles.

== Manifestations ==
There are many observable physical phenomena that arise in interactions involving virtual particles. For bosonic particles that exhibit rest mass when they are free and actual, virtual interactions are characterized by the relatively short range of the force interaction produced by particle exchange. Confinement can lead to a short range, too. Examples of such short-range interactions are the strong and weak forces, and their associated field bosons.

For the gravitational and electromagnetic forces, the zero rest-mass of the associated boson particle permits long-range forces to be mediated by virtual particles. However, in the case of photons, power and information transfer by virtual particles is a relatively short-range phenomenon (existing only within a few wavelengths of the field-disturbance, which carries information or transferred power), as for example seen in the characteristically short range of inductive and capacitative effects in the near field zone of coils and antennas.

Some field interactions which may be seen in terms of virtual particles are:
* The Coulomb force (static electric force) between electric charges. It is caused by the exchange of virtual photons. In symmetric 3-dimensional space this exchange results in the inverse square law for electric force. Since the photon has no mass, the coulomb potential has an infinite range.
* The magnetic field between magnetic dipoles. It is caused by the exchange of virtual photons. In symmetric 3-dimensional space, this exchange results in the inverse cube law for magnetic force. Since the photon has no mass, the magnetic potential has an infinite range. Even though the range is infinite, the time lapse allowed for a virtual photon existence is not infinite.
* Electromagnetic induction. This phenomenon transfers energy to and from a magnetic coil via a changing (electro)magnetic field.
* The strong nuclear force between quarks is the result of interaction of virtual gluons. The residual of this force outside of quark triplets (neutron and proton) holds neutrons and protons together in nuclei, and is due to virtual mesons such as the pi meson and rho meson.
* The weak nuclear force is the result of exchange by virtual W and Z bosons.
* The spontaneous emission of a photon during the decay of an excited atom or excited nucleus; such a decay is prohibited by ordinary quantum mechanics and requires the quantization of the electromagnetic field for its explanation.
* The Casimir effect, where the ground state of the quantized electromagnetic field causes attraction between a pair of electrically neutral metal plates.
* The van der Waals force, which is partly due to the Casimir effect between two atoms.
* Vacuum polarization, which involves pair production or the decay of the vacuum, which is the spontaneous production of particle-antiparticle pairs (such as electron-positron).
* Lamb shift of positions of atomic levels.
* The impedance of free space, which defines the ratio between the electric field strength and the magnetic field strength : .
* Much of the so-called near-field of radio antennas, where the magnetic and electric effects of the changing current in the antenna wire and the charge effects of the wire&#x27;s capacitive charge may be (and usually are) important contributors to the total EM field close to the source, but both of which effects are dipole effects that decay with increasing distance from the antenna much more quickly than do the influence of &quot;conventional&quot; electromagnetic waves that are &quot;far&quot; from the source. These far-field waves, for which is (in the limit of long distance) equal to , are composed of actual photons. Actual and virtual photons are mixed near an antenna, with the virtual photons responsible only for the &quot;extra&quot; magnetic-inductive and transient electric-dipole effects, which cause any imbalance between and . As distance from the antenna grows, the near-field effects (as dipole fields) die out more quickly, and only the &quot;radiative&quot; effects that are due to actual photons remain as important effects. Although virtual effects extend to infinity, they drop off in field strength as rather than the field of EM waves composed of actual photons, which drop as .

Most of these have analogous effects in solid-state physics; indeed, one can often gain a better intuitive understanding by examining these cases. In semiconductors, the roles of electrons, positrons and photons in field theory are replaced by electrons in the conduction band, holes in the valence band, and phonons or vibrations of the crystal lattice. A virtual particle is in a virtual state where the probability amplitude is not conserved. Examples of macroscopic virtual phonons, photons, and electrons in the case of the tunneling process were presented by Günter Nimtz and Alfons A. Stahlhofen.

== Feynman diagrams ==

The calculation of scattering amplitudes in theoretical particle physics requires the use of some rather large and complicated integrals over a large number of variables. These integrals do, however, have a regular structure, and may be represented as Feynman diagrams. The appeal of the Feynman diagrams is strong, as it allows for a simple visual presentation of what would otherwise be a rather arcane and abstract formula. In particular, part of the appeal is that the outgoing legs of a Feynman diagram can be associated with actual, on-shell particles. Thus, it is natural to associate the other lines in the diagram with particles as well, called the &quot;virtual particles&quot;. In mathematical terms, they correspond to the propagators appearing in the diagram.

In the adjacent image, the solid lines correspond to actual particles (of momentum p1 and so on), while the dotted line corresponds to a virtual particle carrying momentum &quot;k&quot;. For example, if the solid lines were to correspond to electrons interacting by means of the electromagnetic interaction, the dotted line would correspond to the exchange of a virtual photon. In the case of interacting nucleons, the dotted line would be a virtual pion. In the case of quarks interacting by means of the strong force, the dotted line would be a virtual gluon, and so on.
Virtual particles may be mesons or vector bosons, as in the example above; they may also be fermions. However, in order to preserve quantum numbers, most simple diagrams involving fermion exchange are prohibited. The image to the right shows an allowed diagram, a one-loop diagram. The solid lines correspond to a fermion propagator, the wavy lines to bosons.

== Vacuums ==
In formal terms, a particle is considered to be an eigenstate of the particle number operator &quot;a&quot;†&quot;a&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; is the particle annihilation operator and &quot;a&quot;† the particle creation operator (sometimes collectively called ladder operators). In many cases, the particle number operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian for the system. This implies the number of particles in an area of space is not a well-defined quantity but, like other quantum observables, is represented by a probability distribution. Since these particles are not certain to exist, they are called &quot;virtual particles&quot; or &quot;vacuum fluctuations&quot; of vacuum energy. In a certain sense, they can be understood to be a manifestation of the time-energy uncertainty principle in a vacuum.

An important example of the &quot;presence&quot; of virtual particles in a vacuum is the Casimir effect. Here, the explanation of the effect requires that the total energy of all of the virtual particles in a vacuum can be added together. Thus, although the virtual particles themselves are not directly observable in the laboratory, they do leave an observable effect: Their zero-point energy results in forces acting on suitably arranged metal plates or dielectrics. On the other hand, the Casimir effect can be interpreted as the relativistic van der Waals force.

== Pair production ==

Virtual particles are often popularly described as coming in pairs, a particle and antiparticle which can be of any kind. These pairs exist for an extremely short time, and then mutually annihilate, or in some cases, the pair may be boosted apart using external energy so that they avoid annihilation and become actual particles, as described below.

This may occur in one of two ways. In an accelerating frame of reference, the virtual particles may appear to be actual to the accelerating observer; this is known as the Unruh effect. In short, the vacuum of a stationary frame appears, to the accelerated observer, to be a warm gas of actual particles in thermodynamic equilibrium.

Another example is pair production in very strong electric fields, sometimes called vacuum decay. If, for example, a pair of atomic nuclei are merged to very briefly form a nucleus with a charge greater than about 140, (that is, larger than about the inverse of the fine-structure constant, which is a dimensionless quantity), the strength of the electric field will be such that it will be energetically favorable to create positron–electron pairs out of the vacuum or Dirac sea, with the electron attracted to the nucleus to annihilate the positive charge. This pair-creation amplitude was first calculated by Julian Schwinger in 1951.

== Compared to actual particles ==
As a consequence of quantum mechanical uncertainty, any object or process that exists for a limited time or in a limited volume cannot have a precisely defined energy or momentum. For this reason, virtual particles – which exist only temporarily as they are exchanged between ordinary particles – do not typically obey the mass-shell relation; the longer a virtual particle exists, the more the energy and momentum approach the mass-shell relation.

The lifetime of real particles is typically vastly longer than the lifetime of the virtual particles. Electromagnetic radiation consists of real photons which may travel light years between the emitter and absorber, but (Coulombic) electrostatic attraction and repulsion is a relatively short-range force that is a consequence of the exchange of virtual photons .

<text>Secondo Campini (August 28, 1904 – February 7, 1980) was an Italian engineer and one of the pioneers of the jet engine.

Campini was born at Bologna, Emilia-Romagna. In 1931 he wrote a proposal for the Italian Air Ministry on the value of jet propulsion, and in 1932 demonstrated a jet-powered boat in Venice. With support of the Air Ministry, he began work with Italian aircraft manufacturer Caproni to develop a jet aircraft, the Caproni Campini C.C.2, which first flew in 1940.

The &quot;motorjet&quot; that Campini developed to propel the C.C.2 is substantially different from the jet engines of today. Campini&#x27;s engine used a conventional piston engine to compress air, which was then mixed with fuel and ignited. Modern jets are based on the turbojet principle, but Campini&#x27;s engine was nevertheless a true jet, since it was the reactive force of the burning exhaust gases that pushed the aircraft along.

After World War II, Campini emigrated to the US at the request of Preston Tucker (noted for the Tucker 48 automobile), who wanted Campini to help him with his new corporation. Tucker asked Campini to both help him develop a turbine powered car, and also used his fame to attempt to secure a US Air Force development contract for the Tucker Corporation. After the Tucker Corporation folded in 1948, he worked on a number of military projects, including the YB-49 flying-wing bomber.

Campini died in Milan in 1980.

<text>USS &quot;Wyoming&quot; was the second ship of the United States Navy to bear that name, but the first to bear it in honor of the 44th state. The first &quot;Wyoming&quot; was named for Wyoming Valley in eastern Pennsylvania.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; was ordered on 4 May 1898, and awarded to the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, 5 October 1898. The keel of Monitor No. 10 was laid down on 11 April 1898. She was launched on 8 September 1900 sponsored by Miss Hattie Warren, daughter of Senator Francis E. Warren of Wyoming, and commissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, on 8 December 1902. The total cost for the hull, machinery, armor and armament was $1,624,270.59.

In 1909, the ship was renamed Cheyenne to free her original name for a new battleship and she was allocated the hull number M-10, which was altered to BM-10 in 1920 and ultimately IX-4 in 1921. She was ultimately sold for scrap in 1939.

==Design==
The s had been designed to combine a heavy striking power with easy concealment and negligible target area. They had a displacement of , measured in overall length, with a beam of and a draft of . She was manned by a total crew of 13 officers and 209 men.

&quot;Wyoming&quot;, the first ship in the fleet to be converted to oil power, was powered by two vertical triple expansion engines driving two screw propellers with steam generated by four Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The engines in &quot;Wyoming&quot; were designed to produce with a top speed of , however, on sea trials she was only able to produce with a top speed of . &quot;Wyoming&quot; was designed to provide a range of at .

The ship was armed with a main battery of two /40 caliber guns, either Mark 3 or Mark 4, in a Mark 4 turret. The secondary battery consisted of four /50 caliber Mark 7 guns along with three 6-pounder guns. The main belt armor was in the middle tapering to at the ends. The gun turrets were between , with barbettes. &quot;Wyoming&quot; also had a deck.

==Service history==

===&quot;Wyoming&quot;===
After fitting out at Mare Island, &quot;Wyoming&quot; ran her trials and exercises in San Pablo Bay and San Francisco Bay and conducted exercises and target practice off the southern California coast through the summer of 1903 before she headed south in the autumn, reaching Acapulco, Mexico, on 31 October. She subsequently shifted further south, to Colombia, where a civil war and a rebellion in the Panamanian territory instigated by the United States government, took part in the independence of the Panamanian territory from Colombia, to later build the Panama Canal. The monitor accordingly arrived in Panamanian waters on 13 November and sailed up the Tuira River in company with the protected cruiser , with a company of Marines under Lieutenant S.A.M. Patterson, USMC, and Lieutenant C.B. Taylor, USMC, embarked, to land at Yariza and observe the movements of Colombian troops.

The presence of American armed might there and elsewhere ultimately aided in independence for the Panamanians. During that time, &quot;Wyoming&quot; anchored at the Bay of San Miguel, Panama, on 15 December. The following day, a boat with 11 Marines embarked for the port of La Palma, Panama, under sail. While &quot;Boston&quot; departed the scene on 17 December, &quot;Wyoming&quot; shifted to La Palma on the following day. There, Lieutenant Patterson, USMC, with a detachment of 25 marines, commandeered the steamer &quot;Tuira&quot; and took her upriver. While the Marines were gone, a party of evacuated American nationals came out to the monitor in her gig. Meanwhile, Patterson&#x27;s Marines had joined the ship&#x27;s landing force at the village of Real to keep an eye on American interests there. Back at La Palma, &quot;Wyoming&quot; continued to take on board American nationals fleeing from the troubled land and kept up a steady stream of supplies to her landing party of bluejackets and Marines at Real. Ultimately, when the need for them had passed, the landing party returned to the ship on Christmas Eve. &quot;Wyoming&quot; remained in Panamanian waters into the spring of 1904 keeping a figurative eye on local conditions before she departed Panama Bay on 19 April, bound for Acapulco, Mexico. After remaining at that port from 27 to 29 April, &quot;Wyoming&quot; visited Pichilinque, Mexico from 3 to 9 May. She subsequently reached San Diego, on 14 May for a nine-day stay.

For the remainder of 1904, &quot;Wyoming&quot; operated off the West Coast, ranging from Brighton Beach, California, and Ventura, California, to Bellingham, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. She attended a regatta at Astoria, Oregon, from 22 to 27 August and later took part in ceremonies at the &quot;unveiling of monuments&quot; at Griffin Bay, San Juan Islands and Roche Harbor before she entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, on 22 October. &quot;Wyoming&quot; was overhauled there into the following year. She departed the Pacific Northwest on 26 January 1905 and steamed via San Francisco to Magdalena Bay, Mexico, for target practice. Later cruising to Acapulco and Panamanian waters, &quot;Wyoming&quot; also operated off San Salvador and Port Harford, California, before she returned to Mare Island on 30 July to be decommissioned on 29 August 1905.

Recommissioned on 8 October 1908 with Commander John J. Knapp in command, &quot;Wyoming&quot; spent over two months at Mare Island refitting. Converted to fuel oil – the first ship to do so in the United States Navy – she underwent tests for her oil-burning installation at San Francisco, Santa Barbara, California, and San Diego, into March 1909. During those tests, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was renamed &quot;Cheyenne&quot; on 1 January 1909, in order to clear the name &quot;Wyoming&quot; for the projected Battleship No. 32. The ship consequently underwent more tests on her oil-burning equipment at Santa Barbara, San Pedro, and San Diego before she was placed in reserve at Mare Island on 8 June. She was decommissioned on 13 November of the same year.

===&quot;Cheyenne&quot;===
Recommissioned, in reserve, on 11 July 1910, Lieutenant Commander Charles Trusedale Owens in command, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was assigned to the Washington Naval Militia in 1911 and operated in an &quot;in commission, in reserve&quot; status into 1913. Shifting to the Puget Sound Navy Yard early in February 1913, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was fitted out as a submarine tender over the ensuing months. Finally, on 20 August 1913, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was placed in &quot;full commission&quot;. The newly converted submarine tender operated in the Puget Sound region until 11 December, when she sailed for San Francisco. In the ensuing months, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; tended the submarines of the Second Submarine Division, Pacific Torpedo Flotilla, at Mare Island, San Francisco, and San Pedro, into April 1914. Later that spring, when troubled conditions in Mexico threatened American lives and property, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; interrupted her submarine tending duties twice, once in late April and once in mid-May, to embark refugees at Ensenada, Mexico, and San Quentin, Mexico, transporting them both times to San Diego.

&quot;Cheyenne&quot; then resumed her submarine tending operations on the West Coast, continuing them into 1917. On 10 April of that year, four days after the U.S. entered World War I, she proceeded to Port Angeles, Washington, the designated point of mobilization for the Pacific Fleet, in company with the submarines and , arriving there on 16 April. Subsequently, shifting to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; remained at that port for most of a month taking on stores and provisions loading ammunition and receiving men on board to fill the vacancies in her complement. On 28 April &quot;Cheyenne&quot; guarded as she ran trials off Port Townsend, Washington. On 4 May, the warship returned to Puget Sound for drydock and yard work. Completing that refit late in May, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; shifted southward to San Pedro, Los Angeles, where she established a submarine base and training camp for personnel for submarine duty. &quot;Cheyenne&quot; subsequently joined the Atlantic Fleet, serving as flagship and tender for Division 3, Flotilla 1, Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet. On 17 December 1918, the ship was transferred to Division 1, American Patrol Detachment. While with that force, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; lay at Tampico, Mexico, protecting American lives and property from 16 January to 9 October 1919. Proceeding north soon thereafter, the warship arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 October 1919, where she was decommissioned on 3 January 1920.

While inactive at Philadelphia, the ship was classified as a miscellaneous auxiliary, under the hull number IX-4, in the fleetwide designation of alphanumeric hull classification symbols of 17 July 1920. Subsequently, recommissioned at Philadelphia on 22 September of the same year, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was towed to Baltimore, Maryland, by the tug . Based there, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was assigned to training duty with Naval Reserve Force (USNRF) personnel of subdistrict &quot;A&quot; of the Fifth Naval District, and trained USNRF reservists through 1925. Based at Baltimore, she occasionally visited Hampton Roads during her cruises. On 21 January 1926, the minesweeper took &quot;Cheyenne&quot; in tow and took her to Norfolk, Virginia, and thence to Philadelphia, where she arrived on 27 January for inactivation. Decommissioned on 1 June 1926, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 January 1937, and her stripped-down hulk was sold for scrap on 20 April 1939.

<text>Marinus van der Lubbe (; 13 January 1909 – 10 January 1934) was a Dutch communist who was tried, convicted, and executed by the government of Nazi Germany for setting fire to the Reichstag building—the national parliament of Germany—on 27 February 1933. During his trial, the prosecution argued that van der Lubbe had acted on behalf of a wider communist conspiracy, while left-wing anti-Nazis argued that the fire was a false flag attack arranged by the Nazis themselves. Most historians agree that van der Lubbe acted alone, although this is occasionally disputed. Nearly 75 years after the event, the German government granted van der Lubbe a posthumous pardon.

== Early life ==
Marinus van der Lubbe was born in Leiden in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands. His parents were divorced, and after his mother died when he was 12 years old, he went to live with his half-sister&#x27;s family in the town of Oegstgeest. During part of his youth van der Lubbe worked as a bricklayer. He was nicknamed &quot;Dempsey&quot; after boxer Jack Dempsey because of his great strength. While working, van der Lubbe became acquainted with the labour movement; in 1925, at age 16, he joined the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN) and its youth section, the Communist Youth Bund (CJB).

In 1926, he was injured at work, getting lime in his eyes, which hospitalised him for a few months and almost blinded him. Since the injury forced him to quit his job, he was unemployed with a pension of 7.44 guilders a week (roughly US$3.05 at the time, equivalent to US$52.41 in 2023). After some conflicts with his sister, van der Lubbe relocated to Leiden in 1927. There he learned to speak some German and founded the Lenin House, where he organised political meetings. While working for the Tielmann factory, a strike began. Van der Lubbe claimed to the management to be one of the ringleaders and offered to accept any punishment if no one else was punished, even though he was clearly too inexperienced to have been involved seriously. During the trial, he tried to claim sole responsibility and was purportedly hostile to the idea of not being punished.

Afterwards, van der Lubbe planned to emigrate to the USSR, but he lacked the funds to do so. He was active politically among unemployed workers until 1931, when he had a disagreement with the CPN and instead approached the Group of International Communists. In 1933, van der Lubbe fled to Germany to work for communism there. He had a criminal record for several attempted arsons.

== Reichstag fire ==
On 27 February 1933, van der Lubbe was arrested in the Reichstag building, soon after the building had begun burning. Van der Lubbe confessed and claimed to have acted alone and have set the Reichstag building afire in an attempt to rally German workers against fascist rule. 

He was tried along with the chief of the Communist Party of Germany and three members of the Bulgarian Communist Party, who were working in Germany for the Communist International. At his trial, van der Lubbe was convicted and sentenced to death for the Reichstag fire. The four other defendants (Ernst Torgler, Georgi Dimitrov, Blagoy Popov, and Vasil Tanev) were acquitted. Van der Lubbe was guillotined in a Leipzig prison yard on 10 January 1934, three days before his 25th birthday. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Südfriedhof (South Cemetery) in Leipzig.

After World War II, attempts were made by his brother, Jan van der Lubbe, to have the original verdict reversed. In 1967, his sentence was changed by a judge from death to eight years in prison. In 1980, after more lengthy complaints, a West German court reversed the verdict entirely, but that was criticised by the state prosecutor. The case was re-examined by the Federal Court of Justice of Germany for three years. In 1983, the court made a final decision on the matter and reversed the result of the 1980 trial on grounds that there was no basis for it and so it was illegal. However, on 6 December 2007 the public prosecutor general Monika Harms nullified the entire verdict and posthumously pardoned van der Lubbe.

=== Claimed responsibility ===

Historians disagree as to whether van der Lubbe acted alone, as he said, to protest the condition of the German working class, or was involved in a larger conspiracy. The Nazis blamed a communist conspiracy. Responsibility for the Reichstag fire remains an ongoing topic of debate and research in modern historical scholarship. Journalist William Shirer, writing in 1960, surmised that van der Lubbe was goaded into setting a fire at the Reichstag but that the Nazis had set their own more elaborate fire at the same time. According to Ian Kershaw, writing in 1998, the consensus of nearly all contemporary historians is that van der Lubbe had in fact set the Reichstag afire.

== Lex van der Lubbe ==
&quot; van der Lubbe&quot; is the colloquial term for the Nazi law concerning the imposition and execution of the death penalty, passed on 29 March 1933. The name comes from the fact that the law formed the legal basis for the imposition of the death penalty against van der Lubbe.

The Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February 1933 included a list of crimes for which the death penalty was to be imposed instead of a life sentence, as was previously the case. The law concerning the imposition and execution of the death penalty was passed by Hitler&#x27;s government on 29 March (on the basis of the Enabling Act which had been passed on 23 March 1933). It extended the law retroactively to 31 January 1933, thereby violating Article 116 of the Weimar Constitution, which prohibited retroactive penalties. The Enabling Act itself, however, made this legislation constitutional, provided the office of the president and the Reichstag and Reichsrat were not affected. It could thus be applied to van der Lubbe, who had admitted in court that he had set fire to the Reichstag on 27 February.

The law was ultimately repealed by the Allied Control Council on 30 January 1946 through Control Council Act No. 11.

== Exhumation ==
In January 2023, bodily remains at van der Lubbe&#x27;s supposed grave were exhumed. This was done to ascertain the precise location and identity of the grave, as well as to allow for a toxicological analysis. Van der Lubbe had appeared sleepy and apathetic during his trial, resulting in suspicions that he had been drugged. These remains were determined to be van der Lubbe&#x27;s after several months of forensic investigations. The toxicology report showed no evidence that van der Lubbe had been administered drugs, although it was noted that due to decomposition it is impossible to scientifically prove one way or the other and that the question remains open.

<text>Vegetable oils, or vegetable fats, are oils extracted from seeds or from other parts of edible plants. Like animal fats, vegetable fats are &quot;mixtures&quot; of triglycerides. Soybean oil, grape seed oil, and cocoa butter are examples of seed oils, or fats from seeds. Olive oil, palm oil, and rice bran oil are examples of fats from other parts of plants. In common usage, vegetable &quot;oil&quot; may refer exclusively to vegetable fats which are liquid at room temperature. Vegetable oils are usually edible.

==History ==

=== In antiquity ===
Olive oil has been a part of human culture for millennia. Archaeological evidence shows that olives were turned into olive oil by 6000 BC and 4500 BC in present-day Israel. Pagnol, p. 19, says the 6th millennium in Jericho, but cites no source. In ancient Egypt, plant oils including cedar oil, cypress oil, and olive oil were used during the mummification process.

Vegetable oils have been used as lighting fuel for lamps, cooking, medicine and lubrication. Palm oil has long been recognized in West and Central African countries, and European merchants trading with West Africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use as a cooking oil in Europe. It became highly sought-after commodity by British traders for use as an industrial lubricant for machinery during Britain&#x27;s Industrial Revolution.

=== Modern history ===
Palm oil formed the basis of soap products, such as Lever Brothers&#x27; (now Unilever) &quot;Sunlight&quot;, and 
B. J. Johnson Company&#x27;s (now Colgate-Palmolive) &quot;Palmolive,&quot; and by around 1870, palm oil constituted the primary export of some West African countries.

In 1780, Carl Wilhelm Scheele demonstrated that fats were derived from glycerol. Thirty years later Michel Eugène Chevreul deduced that these fats were esters of fatty acids and glycerol. Wilhelm Normann, a German chemist, introduced the hydrogenation of liquid fats in 1901, creating what later became known as trans fats, leading to the development of the global production of margarine and vegetable shortening.

In the United States, cottonseed oil was developed, and marketed by Procter &amp; Gamble as a creamed shortening – Crisco – as early as 1911. Ginning mills were happy to have someone haul away the cotton seeds. The extracted oil was refined and partially hydrogenated to give a solid at room temperature and thus mimic natural lard, and canned under nitrogen gas. Compared to the rendered lard Procter &amp; Gamble was already selling to consumers, Crisco was cheaper, easier to stir into a recipe, and could be stored at room temperature for two years without turning rancid.

Soybeans are protein-rich, and the medium viscosity oil rendered from them was high in polyunsaturates. Henry Ford established a soybean research laboratory, developed soybean plastics and a soy-based synthetic wool, and built a car &quot;almost entirely&quot; out of soybeans. Roger Drackett had a successful new product with Windex, but he invested heavily in soybean research, seeing it as a smart investment. By the 1950s and 1960s, soybean oil had become the most popular vegetable oil in the US; today it is second only to palm oil. In 2018–2019, world production was at 57.4 MT with the leading producers including China (16.6 MT), US (10.9 MT), Argentina (8.4 MT), Brazil (8.2 MT), and EU (3.2 MT).

The early 20th century also saw the start of the use of vegetable oil as a fuel in diesel engines and in heating oil burners. Rudolf Diesel designed his engine to run on vegetable oil. The idea, he hoped, would make his engines more attractive to farmers who had a source of fuel readily available. Diesel&#x27;s first engine ran on its own power for the first time in Augsburg, Germany, on 10 August 1893 on nothing but peanut oil. In remembrance of this event, 10 August has been declared &quot;International Biodiesel Day&quot;. The first patent on Biodiesel was granted in 1937. Periodic petroleum shortages spurred research into vegetable oil as a diesel substitute during the 1930s and 1940s, and again in the 1970s and early 1980s when straight vegetable oil enjoyed its highest level of scientific interest. The 1970s also saw the formation of the first commercial enterprise to allow consumers to run straight vegetable oil in their vehicles. However, biodiesel, produced from oils or fats using transesterification is more widely used. Led by Brazil, many countries built biodiesel plants during the 1990s, and it is now widely available for use in motor vehicles, and is the most common biofuel in Europe today. In France, biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles.

In the mid-1970s, Canadian researchers developed a low-erucic-acid rapeseed cultivar. Because the word &quot;rape&quot; was not considered optimal for marketing, they coined the name &quot;canola&quot; (from &quot;Canada Oil low acid&quot;). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved use of the canola name in January 1985, and U.S. farmers started planting large areas that spring. Canola oil is lower in saturated fats, and higher in monounsaturates. Canola is very thin (unlike corn oil) and flavorless (unlike olive oil), so it largely succeeds by displacing soy oil, just as soy oil largely succeeded by displacing cottonseed oil.

The production of vegetable oils went up 125% between 2000 and 2020, driven by a sharp increase in palm oil.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
Many vegetable oils are consumed directly, or indirectly as ingredients in food – a role that they share with some animal fats, including butter, ghee, lard, and schmaltz. The oils serve a number of purposes in this role:
* Shortening – as in giving pastries a crumbly texture.
* Enriching – adding calories and satisfaction in consumption
* Texture – altering how ingredients combine, especially fats and starches
* Flavoring – examples include olive, sesame, or almond oil
* Flavor base – oils can also &quot;carry&quot; flavors of other ingredients, such as peppers, since many flavors are due to chemicals that are soluble in oil.

Oils can be heated to temperatures significantly higher than the boiling point of water, , and used to fry foods. Oils for this purpose must have a high flash point. Such oils include both the major cooking oils – soybean, rapeseed, canola, sunflower, safflower, peanut, cottonseed, etc. – and tropical oils, such as coconut, palm, and rice bran. The latter are particularly valued in Asian cultures for high-temperature cooking, because of their unusually high flash points.

===Industrial===
Vegetable oils are used as an ingredient or component in many manufactured products.

Many vegetable oils are used to make soaps, skin products, candles, perfumes and other personal care and cosmetic products. Some oils are particularly suitable as drying oils, and are used in making paints and other wood treatment products. They are used in alkyd resin production. Dammar oil (a mixture of linseed oil and dammar resin), for example, is used almost exclusively in treating the hulls of wooden boats. Vegetable oils are increasingly being used in the electrical industry as insulators as vegetable oils are not toxic to the environment, biodegradable if spilled and have high flash and fire points. However, vegetable oils are less stable chemically, so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen, and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate. Synthetic tetraesters, which are similar to vegetable oils but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester, are manufactured by Fischer esterification. Tetraesters generally have high stability to oxidation and have found use as engine lubricants. Vegetable oil is being used to produce biodegradable hydraulic fluid and lubricant.

One limiting factor in industrial uses of vegetable oils is that all such oils are susceptible to becoming rancid. Oils that are more stable, such as ben oil or mineral oil, are thus preferred for industrial uses. Castor oil has numerous industrial uses, owing to the presence of a hydroxyl group on the fatty acid. Castor oil is a precursor to Nylon 11. Castor oil may also be reacted with epichlorohydrin to make a glycidyl ether which is used as a diluent and flexibilizer with epoxy resins.

===Pet food additive===
Vegetable oil is used in the production of some pet foods. AAFCO defines vegetable oil in this context as the product of vegetable origin obtained by extracting the oil from seeds or fruits which are processed for edible purposes.

===Fuel===
Vegetable oils are also used to make biodiesel, which can be used like conventional diesel. Some vegetable oil blends are used in unmodified vehicles but straight vegetable oil, also known as pure plant oil, needs specially prepared vehicles which have a method of heating the oil to reduce its viscosity. The use of vegetable oils as alternative energy is growing and the availability of biodiesel around the world is increasing.

The NNFCC estimates that the total net greenhouse gas savings when using vegetable oils in place of fossil fuel-based alternatives for fuel production, range from 18 to 100%.

==Production==
The production process of vegetable oil involves the removal of oil from plant components, typically seeds. This can be done via mechanical extraction using an oil mill or chemical extraction using a solvent. The extracted oil can then be purified and, if required, refined or chemically altered.

===Mechanical extraction===
Oils can be removed via mechanical extraction, termed &quot;crushing&quot; or &quot;pressing&quot;. This method is typically used to produce the more traditional oils (e.g., olive, coconut etc.), and it is preferred by most health-food customers in the United States and in Europe. There are several different types of mechanical extraction. Expeller pressing extraction is common, though the screw press, ram press, and ghani (powered mortar and pestle) are also used. Oilseed presses are commonly used in developing countries, among people for whom other extraction methods would be prohibitively expensive; the ghani is primarily used in India. The amount of oil extracted using these methods varies widely, as shown in the following table for extracting mowrah butter in India:

===Solvent extraction===
The processing of vegetable oil in commercial applications is commonly done by chemical extraction, using solvent extracts, which produces higher yields and is quicker and less expensive. The most common solvent is petroleum-derived hexane. This technique is used for most of the &quot;newer&quot; industrial oils such as soybean and corn oils. After extraction, the solvent is evaporated out by heating the mixture to about .

Supercritical carbon dioxide can be used as a non-toxic alternative to other solvents.

===Hydrogenation===
Unsaturated vegetable oils can be transformed through partial or complete hydrogenation into oils of higher melting point, some of which, such as vegetable shortening, will remain solid at room temperature. 

Hydrogenating vegetable oil is done by raising a blend of vegetable oil and a metal catalyst, typically nickel, in near-vacuum to very high temperatures, and introducing hydrogen. This causes the carbon atoms of the oil to break double-bonds with other carbons. Each carbon atom becomes single-bonded to an individual hydrogen atom, and the double bond between carbons can no longer exist. A fully hydrogenated oil, also called a saturated fat, has had all of its double bonds converted into single bonds. If a polyunsaturated oil is left incompletely hydrogenated (not all of the double bonds are reduced to single bonds), then it is a &quot;partially hydrogenated oil&quot; (PHO). An oil may be hydrogenated to increase resistance to rancidity (oxidation) or to change its physical characteristics. As the degree of saturation is raised by full or partial hydrogenation, the oil&#x27;s viscosity and melting point increase.

While full hydrogenation produces largely saturated fatty acids, partial hydrogenation results in the transformation of unsaturated cis fatty acids to unsaturated trans fatty acids in the oil mixture due to the heat used in hydrogenation. Partially hydrogenated oils and their trans fats have been linked to an increased risk of mortality from coronary heart disease, among other increased health risks. These concerns have led to regulations mandating the removal of partially hydrogenated oils from food.

===Deodorization===
In the processing of edible oils, the oil is heated under vacuum to near the smoke point or to about , and water is introduced at the bottom of the oil. The water immediately is converted to steam, which bubbles through the oil, carrying with it any chemicals which are water-soluble. The steam sparging removes impurities that can impart unwanted flavors and odors to the oil. Deodorization is key to the manufacture of vegetable oils. Nearly all soybean, corn, and canola oils found on supermarket shelves go through a deodorization stage that removes trace amounts of odors and flavors, and lightens the color of the oil. However, the process commonly results in higher levels of trans fatty acids and distillation of the oil&#x27;s natural compounds.

=== Occupational exposure ===
People can breathe in vegetable oil mist in the workplace. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for vegetable oil mist exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 10 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday.

===Yield===

Typical productivity of some oil crops, measured in tons (t) of oil produced per hectare (ha) of land per year (yr). Oil palm is by far the highest yielding crop, capable of producing about 4 tons of palm oil per hectare per year.
==Particular oils==

The following triglyceride vegetable oils account for almost all worldwide production, by volume. All are used as both cooking oils and as SVO or to make biodiesel. According to the USDA, the total world consumption of major vegetable oils in 2007/08 was:
These figures include industrial and animal feed use. The majority of European rapeseed oil production is used to produce biodiesel, or used directly as fuel in diesel cars which may require modification to heat the oil to reduce its higher viscosity.

Other significant oils include:

* Corn oil, one of the most common cooking oils, is used for cooking oil, salad dressing, margarine, mayonnaise, prepared goods like spaghetti sauce and baking mixes, and to fry prepared foods like potato chips and French fries.
* Grape seed oil, used in cooking and cosmetics
* Hazelnut oil and other nut oils
* Linseed oil, from flax seeds
* Rice bran oil, from rice grains
* Safflower oil, a flavorless and colorless cooking oil
* Sesame oil, used as a cooking oil, and as a massage oil, particularly in India
* Açaí palm oil, used in culinary and cosmetics
* Jambú oil, is extracted from the flowers, leaves and stem from jambu (&quot;Acmella oleracea&quot;), contains spilanthol 
* Graviola oil, derived from &quot;Annona muricata&quot;
* Tucumã oil, from &quot;Astrocaryum aculeatum&quot; is used to manufacture soap.
* Brazil nut oil, culinary and cosmetics use
* Carapa oil, pharmaceutical use and anti-mosquito candle
* Buriti oil, from &quot;Mauritia flexuosa&quot;, used in cosmetics (skin and hair care)
* Passion fruit oil, derived from &quot;Passiflora edulis&quot;, has varied applications in cosmetics manufacturing and for uses as a human or animal food.
* Pracaxi oil, obtained from &quot;Pentaclethra macroloba&quot;, cosmetics use
* Solarium oil, derived from chloroplasts, various applications in cooking

===Composition of fats===
==Seed oil==

Seed oils are vegetable oils obtained from the seed (endosperm) rather than other parts of plants. Most vegetable oils are seed oils. Examples are sunflower, corn, and sesame oils.

Claims that seed oils are unhealthy are not supported by scientific evidence.
===Pre-pressing===
Oils are extracted first by expeller or cold pressing methods, then solvent expelling the rest of the oils from the leftover matter. This is a method used by larger capacity oil mills. As the energy consumption of the mechanical press increases as more oil is released, it is more efficient to extract the rest of the oil (past around 60%) by solvent extraction.

==Used oil==

A large quantity of used vegetable oil is produced and recycled, mainly from industrial deep fryers in potato processing plants, snack food factories and fast food restaurants.

Recycled oil has numerous uses, including use as a direct fuel, as well as in the production of biodiesel, livestock feed, pet food, soap, detergent, cosmetics, and industrial chemicals.

Since 2002, an increasing number of European Union countries have prohibited the inclusion of recycled vegetable oil from catering in animal feed. Used cooking oils from food manufacturing, however, as well as fresh or unused cooking oil, continue to be used in their animal feed.

==Shelf life==
Due to their susceptibility to oxidation from exposure to oxygen, heat and light, resulting in the formation of oxidation products, such as peroxides and hydroperoxides, plant oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids have a limited shelf-life.

==Product labeling==
In Canada, palm oil is one of five vegetable oils, along with palm kernel oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, and cocoa butter, which must be specifically named in the list of ingredients for a food product. Also, oils in Canadian food products which have been modified or hydrogenated must contain the word &quot;modified&quot; or &quot;hydrogenated&quot; when listed as an ingredient. A mix of oils other than the aforementioned exceptions may simply be listed as &quot;vegetable oil&quot; in Canada; however, if the food product is a cooking oil, salad oil or table oil, the type of oil must be specified and listing &quot;vegetable oil&quot; as an ingredient is not acceptable.

From December 2014, all food products produced in the European Union were legally required to indicate the specific vegetable oil used in their manufacture, following the introduction of the Food Information to Consumers Regulation.

<doc id="192332" wikidata="Q158838" url="?curid=192332" title="Patrice de MacMahon">
<text>Marie Edme Patrice Maurice de MacMahon, marquis de MacMahon, duc de Magenta (; 13 June 1808 – 17 October 1893), was a French general and politician who served as President of France from 1873 to 1879. He was elevated to the dignity of Marshal of France by Napoleon III.

MacMahon led the main French army in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. He was trapped and wounded at the Battle of Sedan in September 1870, in part because of his confused and indecisive strategic planning. The army, including MacMahon and Emperor Napoleon III, surrendered to the Germans. Thus the Emperor was deposed and the French Third Republic was proclaimed. After convalescing, MacMahon was appointed head of the Versailles army, which suppressed the Paris Commune revolt in May 1871 and set the stage for his political career. 

According to David Bell, after Thiers&#x27; resignation in May 1873, the royalist majority in the National Assembly drafted MacMahon as the new leader, with the hope that he would hold the fort until the Bourbon pretender was ready to restore the throne. However, the Count of Chambord&#x27;s extreme Legitimist stance made restoration politically impossible. MacMahon refused to support efforts to force the Assembly&#x27;s hand. In the absence of his full support there was no way to achieve monarchy by extra-parliamentary means. The right had no choice but to keep MacMahon in office to gain time and act as a barrier to the left by repressing radical agitation and pursuing policies to restore &quot;moral order&quot; to the country. In November 1873, he was voted a term of office of seven years. However, the divisions among the royalists left MacMahon in a political predicament for which he was not prepared, trying to keep the Republicans at bay without defined powers or a clear source of legitimacy, without a clear majority in parliament or the country, and without the use of force. In 1874, due to demands for Bonapartism, MacMahon called for constitutional reform. To ensure calm this led to a system of a President and Senate elected indirectly. In 1876, MacMahon had to accept governments by moderate Republicans. However, in 1877, MacMahon dismissed Simon and recalled the Duke de Broglie. The new government was dissolved on a no confidence vote. Conservatives hoped to exploit their influential press, heavy patronage, and martial law to coerce the voters. They failed in the general election of October 1877, as the Republicans won the majority despite the challenges on the right. In January 1879, the Republicans forced MacMahon&#x27;s resignation. He died in 1893, with Republicans viewing him as a danger to the Republic and diehard monarchists considering him a bungler who mishandled their dream of restoration.

MacMahon was a devout conservative Catholic, and a traditionalist who despised anarchism, communism, socialism and liberalism and strongly distrusted the mostly secular Republicans. He kept to his duty as the neutral guardian of the Constitution and rejected suggestions of a monarchist &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, but refused to meet with Gambetta, the leader of the Republicans. He moved for a parliamentary system in which the assembly selected the ruling government of the Third Republic, but he also insisted on an upper chamber. He later dissolved the Chamber of Deputies, resulting in public outrage and a Republican electoral victory. Soon after MacMahon resigned and retired to private life.

== Family and early life ==

The MacMahon family is of Irish origin. They were Lords of Corcu Baiscind in Ireland and descended from Mahon, the son of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. After losing much of their land in the Cromwellian confiscations of 1652, a branch moved to Limerick for a time. They supported the deposed King James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and settled in France during the subsequent reign of King William III. They applied for French citizenship in 1749; after the definitive installation of the family in France, their nobility was recognised by the patent letter of King Louis XV of France.

A military family (14 members of the house of de Mac Mahon were in the Army), they settled in Autun, Burgundy, at the Chateau de Sully, where Patrice de Mac Mahon was born on 13 June 1808, sixteenth and the second-youngest son of Baron (1754–1831), Baron of Sully, Count de Mac Mahon and de Charnay, and Pélagie de Riquet de Caraman (1769–1819), a descendant of Pierre-Paul Riquet.

Patrice de MacMahon (as he was usually known before being elevated to a ducal title in his own right) was born in Sully near Autun, in the &quot;département&quot; of Saône-et-Loire. He was the 16th of 17 children of a family already in the French nobility; his grandfather Knight Lord Overlord Jean-Baptiste de MacMahon, was named Marquis de MacMahon and 1st Marquis d&#x27;Éguilly (from his wife Charlotte Le Belin, Dame d&#x27;Éguilly) by King Louis XV, and the family in France had decidedly royalist politics.

== Military career ==

=== Early career and service in Algeria ===
In 1820, MacMahon entered the Petit Séminaire des Marbres at Autun; then completed his education at Lycée Louis-le-Grand at Paris. He then entered the Special Military School at Saint-Cyr on 23 October 1825. He then joined the application school at the General Staff Headquarters on 1 October 1827, for a period of two years.

Following his graduation from Saint-Cyr, MacMahon entered the French Army in 1827. He was assigned to the 4th Hussars Regiment in 1830. MacMahon subsequently participated in the French conquest of Algeria as a sous-lieutenant in the . He was commended for his capacity and bravery during the seizure of Algiers. On 24 November 1830, MacMahon further distinguished himself while serving with his regiment, during the , during the . He was awarded the Knight Order of the Legion d&#x27;honneur.

Recalled to France, MacMahon participated in 1832 to the Ten Days&#x27; Campaign where he was noticed again during the Siege of Antwerp.

He became a captain in 1833, and returned to Algeria, this time, in 1836 where he was placed under the orders of General Bertrand Clausel, and then General Charles-Marie Denys de Damrémont. He led several audacious cavalry raids across tribal occupied plains and distinguished himself during the Siege of Constantine, in 1837, where he was slightly wounded. In 1840, he left Africa (Algeria) and upon his return to France, he learnt that he had been promoted to chef d&#x27;escadron (cavalry squadron chief).

In May 1841, he returned again to Algeria at the head of the with whom he distinguished himself, in April, at the Battle of Bab el-Thaza and against the troops of Emir Abdelkader, on 25 May.

On 31 December 1842, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel at the 2nd Regiment of the French Foreign Legion 2ème R.E.L.E. In 1843, he assumed the functions of regimental commander, by replacing the ill holder, a command which he kept until 1845.

MacMahon distinguished himself again during the battle of Chaab el-Gitta and the battle of Aïn Kebira on 14 October and 17 October 1844.

Nominated to colonel in December 1845, he assumed the command of the , garrisoned at Marnia.

Since 1848, MacMahon was nominated at the head of the subdivision of Tlemcen, where he was designated as a général de brigade on 12 June of the same year.

In 1849, he became a Commander of the Order of the Legion d&#x27;honneur, and served under General Aimable Pélissier, chief of the general staff of the Oran Province.

In 1852 MacMahon organized in Algeria the plebiscite of legitimation by universal suffrage destined to approve the French coup d&#x27;état of 1851. In March the same year he was appointed commandment of the , before being promoted to Général de division, in July.

=== Crimean War, Sevastopol ===
During the Crimean War, he was given command of the 1st Infantry Division of the 2nd Orient Army Corps and, in September 1855, he won a victory at the Battle of Malakoff during the Siege of Sevastopol. During the battle he is reputed to have said: &quot;Here I am; here will I stay!&quot; ()

=== Senator and further Algerian service ===
After his return to France, he received a number of honours and was appointed Senator. Desiring a more active life, he refused a senior position in the French metropolitan army, and returned to Algeria. In Algeria, he served in a campaign against the Kabyle people. On his return to France, he voted as senator against a new law on general security, proposed after the failed assassination attempt of Felice Orsini against Emperor Napoleon III; the law (which passed) allowed easier government action against &quot;enemies of the Empire&quot; and those suspected of political crimes, and made anyone who did not pledge allegiance to Napoleon III ineligible for the legislature. 

=== Magenta: Marshal of France ===

MacMahon distinguished himself during the Italian Campaign of 1859. He advanced his troops without having received orders at a critical moment during the Battle of Magenta, which assured French victory.

For his military services, he was appointed a Marshal of France by Emperor Napoleon III, and awarded the title of Duke of Magenta.

=== Governor General of Algeria ===
In 1861 MacMahon represented France at the coronation of William I as King of Prussia. In 1864, he was named as Governor General of Algeria.

MacMahon did not distinguish himself in this appointment. While he initiated several reforms, numerous complaints were made against him. During the first half of 1870, he submitted his resignation to Napoleon III. When the Olivier cabinet was formed, the Emperor abandoned his Algerian projects and MacMahon was recalled.

=== Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune ===
MacMahon led the main French army in the Franco-Prussian War where he suffered several defeats in Alsace. He was seriously wounded during the Battle of Sedan. In 1871 the French army surrendered, and the Germans had clearly won the war. Overall his strategic planning was confused and marked by indecision. He, along with the rest of the army including the Emperor, was made prisoner during the capitulation of Sedan on 1 September.

In 1871, he became the head of the army of the French Third Republic, under President Adolphe Thiers, and in May led the Semaine Sanglante, the bloody week-long military campaign which defeated the Paris Commune and placed the city under the authority of the Third Republic. 
He was not blamed for the repression, but instead became the hero of the hour for the right.

== President of the Republic ==

In May 1873, MacMahon was elected President of the French Third Republic, by the royalist and conservative majority in the National Assembly. Only one vote was cast against him. Renowned for his popularity, MacMahon was elected following the unsuccessful election of Adolphe Thiers on 24 May 1873. He replaced Prime Minister Jules Armand Dufaure with Duke Albert de Broglie, a monarchist. With de Broglie as Prime Minister, he adopted a series of measures to install a new conservative &quot;moral order&quot;. 

MacMahon favoured a restoration of the monarchy but when this project failed, accepted a seven-year mandate which the Assembly gave him on 9 November 1873. Mac Mahon deemed himself responsible to the country than to parliament, which brought him into conflict with the Chamber of Deputies.

In his still unpublished memoirs, MacMahon described his political convictions: &quot;By family tradition, and by the sentiments towards the royal house which were instilled in me by my early education, I could not be anything but a Legitimist.&quot; Nevertheless, in November 1873, he refused to meet with the Bourbon claimant to the throne, Henri, Count of Chambord, as he thought this incompatible with his duties as President of the Republic. On 4 February 1874, MacMahon declared that he would respect the established legal order. Preferring to remain &quot;au-dessus des partis&quot; (above parties), he observed rather than took part in the procedures which in January and February 1875 led to the French Constitutional Laws of 1875, which established the French Third Republic as the government of France.

During the night of 23–24 June 1875 the Garonne region suffered heavy flooding. While visiting the inundated cities and villages he declared &quot;que d&#x27;eau… que d&#x27;eau !… &quot; (nothing but water…only water!…). The prefect of the department responded to him: &quot;Et encore, Monsieur le Président, vous n&#x27;en voyez que le dessus!&quot; (Then again, Mr. President, you are only seeing what&#x27;s above the surface!&quot;).

In September 1875, he stayed at Vernon for several days, in order to prepare the grand maneuvers of the third army. Following the 1876 French legislative election, which resulted in a republican majority, he agreed with great reluctance to the formation of governments under prime ministers Jules Dufaure and Jules Simon, which were dominated by Republicans.

In order to contain France, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck sought to promote republicanism in France by strategically and ideologically isolating MacMahon&#x27;s clerical-monarchist supporters. Bismarck&#x27;s containment policy almost got out of hand in 1875 during the &quot;War in Sight&quot; crisis. There was a war scare in Germany and France when the German press reported that influential Germans, alarmed by France&#x27;s rapid recovery from defeat in 1871 and its rearmaments program, were talking of launching a preemptive attack on France. Britain and Russia made it clear that they would not tolerate such aggression. Bismarck did not seek war either, but the unexpected crisis forced him to take into consideration the alarm that his aggressive policies, plus Germany&#x27;s fast-growing power, were causing among its neighbors.

The 16 May 1877 crisis heightened MacMahon&#x27;s conflict with the Chamber of Deputies. After the bishops of Poitiers, Nimes and Nevers had assured Pius IX of the French government&#x27;s support in the Roman question, the Chamber passed a resolution that asked the government to &quot;suppress the ultramontanism manifestations&quot;. Twelve days later, he dismissed Prime Minister Jules Simon and again appointed Albert de Broglie. Hoping for a conservative victory, MacMahon then convinced the Senate to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies, and campaigned across the country, while protesting that he had no intention of overthrowing the Republic. On 15 August 1877, Léon Gambetta declared: &quot;Le Président n&#x27;a que ce choix: il lui faut se soumettre ou se démettre.&quot; (&quot;The President has only but one choice: he must submit or resign.&quot;)

The elections of 14 October gave the Republicans a majority of 120 seats, and prime minister Broglie accordingly resigned on 19 November. MacMahon attempted first to form a government under General Gaëtan de Rochebouët, but the Chamber refused to cooperate with him. Rochebouët resigned the next day, and the President recalled Dufaure to form a Republican government. On 5 January 1879, elections to the Senate also resulted in a Republican majority, depriving MacMahon of his last parliamentary support. Faced with a decree which revolved around confiscating and diminishing a number of military authorities and commands to certain generals, MacMahon preferred to resign on 30 January 1879. He was succeeded by the Republican Jules Grévy.

His presidency may be summarised thus: on the one hand, he allowed the Republic to establish itself; on the other hand, so far as his lawful prerogatives permitted, he restrained the political advance of parties hostile to the Catholic Church, convinced that the triumph of Radicalism would be to the detriment of the nation. MacMahon&#x27;s government was mildly repressive toward the left. Newspapers were prosecuted, senior officials were removed if they were suspected of support for republicanism. Critical pamphlets were suppressed while the government circulated its own propaganda. The proprietors of meeting places were advised not to allow meetings of critics of the government. On the other hand, he gave no support to a coup d&#x27;état by monarchists. MacMahon truly believed that the National Assembly should rule France and not the president.

==Last years==
From 1887 to 1893, he directed the &quot;Société de secours aux blessés militaires&quot; (S.S.B.M.—Rescue Society of Wounded Military), which in 1940 became the French Red Cross.

Patrice de MacMahon died on 17 October 1893, at the at Montcresson, after having written his memoirs. He was buried on 22 October at the Hôtel des Invalides after a state funeral and a religious mass at La Madeleine. The five cordons (ornamental cords) of the funeral chariot were held by General , Grand Chancellor of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur; Admiral Henri Rieunier, Minister of the Navy; General , Minister of War; Senator Charles Merlin; and M. Malvy from the Chamber of Deputies.

<text>SpongeBob SquarePants is a fictional character and the protagonist of Nickelodeon&#x27;s eponymous American animated television series. Voiced by Tom Kenny, he is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude. SpongeBob is a denizen of Bikini Bottom, where he regularly gets into absurd and humorous scenarios.

SpongeBob was created and designed by Stephen Hillenburg, an artist and marine science educator. The character&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;Bob the Sponge&quot;, the host of Hillenburg&#x27;s unpublished educational book &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot;. He drew the book while teaching marine biology to visitors of the Ocean Institute during the 1980s. Hillenburg began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the 1996 cancellation of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, which Hillenburg served as creative director. SpongeBob&#x27;s first appearance was in the pilot, &quot;Help Wanted&quot;, which premiered on May 1, 1999.

SpongeBob SquarePants has become popular among children and adults. The character has garnered a positive response from media critics and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time.

==Development==
===Conception===

Stephen Hillenburg first became fascinated with the ocean as a child. He began developing his artistic abilities at a young age. During college, he studied marine biology and minored in art. He planned to return to graduate school and eventually to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in art. After graduating in 1984 from Humboldt State University, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history. While he was there, he had the initial idea that would lead to the creation of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;—a comic book titled &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot;. The host of the comic was &quot;Bob the Sponge&quot; who, unlike SpongeBob, resembled an actual sea sponge. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue an animation career.

A few years after studying experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, the creator of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, at an animation festival, and was offered a job as a director of the series. While working on the series, Hillenburg met writer Martin Olson, who saw his previous comic &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot;. Olson liked the idea and suggested Hillenburg create a series of marine animals, which spurred his decision to create &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. Hillenburg did not think of making a series based on &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot; at the time, later telling Thomas F. Wilson in an interview, &quot;a show... I hadn&#x27;t even thought about making a show... and it wasn&#x27;t my show&quot;. Hillenburg later claimed it was &quot;the inspiration for the show&quot;. 

&quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; ended in 1996. Shortly afterwards, Hillenburg began working on &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. He began drawing and took some of the show&#x27;s characters from his comic—like starfish, crab, and sponge. At the time, Hillenburg knew that &quot;everybody was doing buddy shows&quot;—like &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;. He stated, &quot;I can&#x27;t do a buddy show&quot;, so he decided to do a &quot;one character&quot; show instead. He conceived a sponge as the title character because he liked its &quot;versatility... as an animal&quot;. Hillenburg derived the character&#x27;s name from Bob the Sponge, the host of his comic strip &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot;, after changing it from &quot;SpongeBoy&quot; because of trademark issues.

===Creation and design===

Hillenburg had made several &quot;horrible impersonations&quot; before he finally conceived of his character. He compared the concept to Laurel and Hardy and Pee-wee Herman saying, &quot;I think SpongeBob [was] born out of my love of Laurel and Hardy shorts. You&#x27;ve got that kind of idiot-buddy situation – that was a huge influence. SpongeBob was inspired by that kind of character: the Innocent – à la Stan Laurel.&quot;

The first concept sketch portrayed the character wearing a red hat with a green base and a white business shirt with a tie. SpongeBob&#x27;s look gradually changed. He also wore brown pants used in the final design. SpongeBob was designed to be a childlike character who was goofy and optimistic in a style similar to that made famous by Jerry Lewis.

Originally, the character was to be named &quot;SpongeBoy&quot; (and the series named &quot;SpongeBoy Ahoy!&quot;), but this name was already in use for another product. This was discovered after voice acting for the original seven-minute pilot was recorded. Upon learning this, Hillenburg knew that the character&#x27;s name still had to contain &quot;Sponge&quot; so viewers would not mistake him for a &quot;Cheese Man&quot;. In 1997, he decided to use the name &quot;SpongeBob&quot; with &quot;SquarePants&quot; as a family name, with the latter referring to the character&#x27;s square shape and having a &quot;nice ring to it&quot;.

Before commissioning &quot;SpongeBob&quot; as a full series, Nickelodeon executives insisted that it would not be popular unless the main character was a child who went to school. Stephen Hillenburg recalled in 2012 that Nickelodeon told him, &quot;Our winning formula is animation about kids in school... We want you to put SpongeBob in school.&quot; Hillenburg was ready to &quot;walk out&quot; on Nickelodeon and abandon the series since he wanted SpongeBob to be an adult character. He eventually compromised by adding a new character to the main cast, Mrs. Puff, whose occupation as a driving instructor allowed SpongeBob to both appear as an adult and go to school, satisfying both Hillenburg and Nickelodeon. Hillenburg was happy with the compromise and said, &quot;A positive thing for me that came out of it was [how it brought] in a new character, Mrs. Puff, who I love.&quot;

Episodes from 2000 and 2001 have given SpongeBob&#x27;s birthdate as July 14, 1986, although his age is left unclear throughout the series.

SpongeBob has demonstrated an ability to shapeshift, for example into the shape of Texas or his friends&#x27; faces to humor himself.

===Voice===

SpongeBob is voiced by veteran voice actor Tom Kenny, who had worked previously with Hillenburg on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;. When Hillenburg created &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, he approached Kenny to voice the character. Hillenburg used Kenny&#x27;s and other people&#x27;s personalities while creating SpongeBob&#x27;s.

Kenny said in an episode of &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot; that the voice was based on a frustrated dwarf actor he encountered while auditioning for a television commercial. Kenny had originally used SpongeBob&#x27;s voice for a minor background character in &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;. At first, Kenny forgot the voice because he had used it only on that occasion. Hillenburg remembered it when he was coming up with SpongeBob, however, and played a video clip of the &quot;Rocko&quot; episode to remind Kenny of the voice. When Hillenburg heard Kenny do the voice, he said, &quot;That&#x27;s it—I don&#x27;t want to hear anybody else do the voice. We&#x27;ve got SpongeBob.&quot; Kenny recalled that Nickelodeon was unsure of his casting and said, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s just listen to 100 more people.&quot; The network hoped to find a celebrity for the part. Kenny noted: &quot;But one of the advantages of having a strong creator is that the creator can say, &#x27;No, I like that—I don&#x27;t care about celebrities&#x27;.&quot; Kenny recalls Hillenburg &quot;let them know that in no uncertain terms.&quot; SpongeBob&#x27;s high-pitched laugh was specifically designed to be unique according to Kenny. They wanted an annoying laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.

Throughout the series, SpongeBob&#x27;s voice evolved from &quot;low-key&quot; to high-pitched. Kenny said, &quot;I hear the change... It&#x27;s mostly a question of the pitch.&quot; He said that, &quot;It&#x27;s unconscious on my part&quot; because &quot;I don&#x27;t wake up and think, &#x27;Hmm, I&#x27;m going to change SpongeBob&#x27;s voice today, just for the hell of it&#x27;.&quot; He described it as &quot;like erosion: a very slow process. As time goes on, you need to bring him to different places and more places, the more stories and scripts you do.&quot; Contrasting first-season episodes to those of the seventh season, Kenny said that &quot;there&#x27;s a bit of a change [in the voice], but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that extreme at all.&quot;

When &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; was prepared for broadcast in languages other than English, the voice actors dubbing SpongeBob&#x27;s voice used Kenny&#x27;s rendition of the character as a starting point but added unique elements. For example, in the French version of the series, SpongeBob speaks with a slight Daffy Duck-style lisp.

In early 2021, SpongeBob became one of the popular character voices available on 15.ai, an artificial intelligence text-to-speech web application that allowed users to generate speech in the voices of fictional characters. Critics reported that the application replicated SpongeBob&#x27;s voice particularly well, with Natalie Clayton of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; noting that the character&#x27;s distinctive shrill voice was convincingly recreated through the application. The technology allowed fans to create content featuring SpongeBob saying custom phrases, which Peter Paltridge of &quot;Anime Superhero News&quot; described as &quot;nearly indistinguishable from actual human speech&quot; in its more sophisticated implementations.

==Role in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;==
SpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic sea sponge. In &quot;The SpongeBob Musical&quot;, his exact species of animal is identified: &quot;Aplysina fistularis&quot;, a yellow tube sponge that is common in open waters. He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other anthropomorphic aquatic creatures. He works as a fry cook at a local fast food restaurant, the Krusty Krab, to which he is obsessively attached, showing devotion to it above other restaurants. His boss is Eugene Krabs, a greedy crab who nonetheless becomes a father figure to SpongeBob. Squidward Tentacles, an octopus, and SpongeBob&#x27;s ill-tempered, snobbish neighbor, works as the restaurant&#x27;s cashier. SpongeBob&#x27;s hobbies include fishing for jellyfish, practicing karate with his friend Sandy Cheeks (a squirrel from Texas), and blowing bubbles.

SpongeBob is often seen hanging around with his best friend, starfish Patrick Star, one of his neighbors. SpongeBob SquarePants lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail, Gary. His often-overt optimistic attitude makes him ignorant to negativity from others. He believes, for instance, that Squidward Tentacles enjoys his company even though he was clearly annoyed by SpongeBob&#x27;s behavior in most scenarios. SpongeBob&#x27;s greatest goal in life is to obtain his driver&#x27;s license from Mrs. Puff&#x27;s boating school, but he often panics and crashes when driving a boat, failing the course multiple times.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Throughout &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;″ first run, SpongeBob became instantly popular with both children and adults. In June 2010, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named him one of the &quot;100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed SpongeBob SquarePants at number nine on its &quot;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; list. 

James Poniewozik of &quot;Time&quot; magazine considered the character &quot;the anti-Bart Simpson, temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart&#x27;s is unruly, and he has a personality to match–conscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Joyce Millman said, &quot;His relentless good cheer would be irritating if he weren&#x27;t so darned lovable and his world so excellently strange... Like &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet.&quot; Robert Thompson, a professor of communications and director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, told &quot;The New York Times&quot;:There is something kind of unique about [SpongeBob]. It seems to be a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era. There&#x27;s no sense of the elbow-in-rib, a tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest of American culture–including kids&#x27; shows like the &quot;Rugrats&quot;. I think what&#x27;s subversive about it is it&#x27;s so incredibly naive–deliberately. Because there&#x27;s nothing in it that&#x27;s trying to be hip or cool or anything else, hipness can be grafted onto it.

In a 2007 interview with &quot;TV Guide&quot;, Barack Obama named SpongeBob his favorite TV character, saying that he watched &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; with his daughters.

===Criticism and controversy===
In 2005, a promotional video which showed SpongeBob, along with other characters from children&#x27;s shows, singing to promote diversity and tolerance was criticized by a Christian fundamentalist group in the United States because they felt the SpongeBob character was being used as an advocate for homosexuality, despite the video containing &quot;no reference to sex, sexual lifestyle or sexual identity.&quot; James Dobson of Focus on the Family accused the video&#x27;s makers of promoting homosexuality because a gay rights group had sponsored the video.

The incident led to the question whether SpongeBob is a homosexual character. In 2002, when SpongeBob&#x27;s popularity with gay men grew, Hillenburg denied the suggestion. He clarified that he considers the character to be &quot;somewhat asexual.&quot; The term &quot;asexual&quot; was specifically used when discussing the character&#x27;s sexual orientation rather than the context of exclusive asexual reproduction. SpongeBob&#x27;s exact species is the Aplysina fistularis sponge, a species of sponge capable of sexual reproduction in addition to asexual reproduction. The character also has two biological parents. After Dobson&#x27;s comments on the alleged pro-gay content of the show, Hillenburg repeated his assertion that sexual preference was never considered during the creation of the show. Tom Kenny and other production members were shocked and surprised that such an issue had arisen.

Dobson later said that his comments were taken out of context and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob or any of the characters in the video but with the organization that sponsored it, the We Are Family Foundation. Dobson noted that the foundation had posted pro-homosexual material on its website, but later removed it. After the controversy, John H. Thomas, the United Church of Christ&#x27;s general minister and president, said they would welcome SpongeBob into their ministry. He said, &quot;Jesus didn&#x27;t turn people away. Neither do we.&quot;

Jeffrey P. Dennis, author of the journal article &quot;The Same Thing We Do Every Night: Signifying Same-Sex Desire in Television Cartoons&quot;, argued that SpongeBob and Sandy are not romantically in love while adding that he believed that SpongeBob and Patrick &quot;are paired with arguably erotic intensity.&quot; Dennis noted the two are &quot;not consistently coded as romantic partners,&quot; since they live in separate residences, and have distinct groups of friends but claimed that in the series, &quot;the possibility of same-sex desire is never excluded.&quot; Martin Goodman of &quot;Animation World Magazine&quot; described Dennis&#x27;s comments regarding SpongeBob and Patrick as &quot;interesting&quot;.

In April 2009, in a tie-in partnership with Burger King and Nickelodeon, Burger King released an advertisement featuring SpongeBob and Sir Mix-a-Lot singing &quot;Baby Got Back&quot;. Parents and the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) protested the ad for being sexist and inappropriately sexual, considering that SpongeBob&#x27;s audience includes preschoolers. CCFC director Susan Linn said the usage of SpongeBob promoting sexualized images of women was &quot;utterly reprehensible&quot;. In an official statement released by Burger King, the company claimed the campaign was aimed at parents.

In June 2020, Nickelodeon shared a tweet in celebration of Pride Month, featuring SpongeBob SquarePants wearing a rainbow-colored tie. Along with SpongeBob, the tweet included photos of transgender actor Michael D. Cohen, who plays Schwoz Schwartz on &quot;Henry Danger&quot;, and Korra from the &quot;Avatar&quot; spin-off show &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;, who is depicted as being in a same-sex relationship. Some users online interpreted the post as being the network&#x27;s way of quietly announcing that the character was gay; series creator Hillenburg has previously stated he considered SpongeBob to be asexual.

===Cultural impact and legacy===

Throughout &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;″ run, the SpongeBob character became very popular with viewers of all ages. His popularity spread from Nickelodeon&#x27;s original demographic of two- to eleven-year-olds, to teenagers and adults, was popular on college campuses and with celebrities such as Sigourney Weaver and Bruce Willis. Salon.com&#x27;s Stephanie Zacharek feels that the unadulterated innocence of SpongeBob is what makes him so appealing. Since at least 2002, SpongeBob became popular with gay men due to his &quot;flamboyant lifestyle and tolerant attitude&quot;, despite Stephen Hillenburg asserting he is asexual.

In July 2009, the Madame Tussauds wax museum in New York unveiled a wax sculpture of SpongeBob, the first fictional character to be featured there. In May 2011, a new species of mushroom, &quot;Spongiforma squarepantsii&quot;, named after SpongeBob, was described in the journal &quot;Mycologia&quot;. The authors note that the hymenium, when viewed using scanning electron microscopy, somewhat resembles a &quot;seafloor covered with tube sponges, reminiscent of the fictitious home of SpongeBob.&quot; Although the epithet was originally rejected by &quot;Mycologia&quot;″s editors as &quot;too frivolous&quot;, the authors insisted that &quot;we could name it whatever we liked.&quot; Since 2004, SpongeBob has appeared as a balloon in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

The character also became a fashion trend. In 2008, American fashion designer Marc Jacobs donned a SpongeBob tattoo on his right arm. He explained that, &quot;I just worked with Richard Prince on the collaboration for Louis Vuitton and Richard has done a series of paintings of SpongeBob. He had brought up in our conversation how he saw the artistic value of SpongeBob as the cartoon and I kind of liked it, so I did it.&quot; He added that &quot;It&#x27;s funny.&quot; In the same year, A Bathing Ape released &quot;SpongeBob&quot;-themed shoes. Singer Pharrell Williams backed a line of &quot;SpongeBob&quot; T-shirts and shoes targeted at hip adults. In 2014, the character was among the popular culture icons referenced by American fashion designer Jeremy Scott in his Moschino debut collection at the Milan Fashion Week.

In Egypt&#x27;s Tahrir Square, after the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, SpongeBob became a fashion phenomenon, appearing on various merchandise items from hijabs to boxer shorts. The phenomenon led to the creation of the Tumblr project called &quot;SpongeBob on the Nile&quot;, founded by American students Andrew Leber and Elisabeth Jaquette, that attempts to document every appearance of SpongeBob in Egypt. Sherief Elkeshta cited the phenomenon in an essay about the incoherent state of politics in Egypt in an independent monthly paper titled &quot;Midan Masr&quot;. He wrote, &quot;Why isn&#x27;t he [SpongeBob] at least holding a Molotov cocktail? Or raising a fist?&quot; The phenomenon has even spread to Libya, where a Libyan rebel in SpongeBob dress was photographed celebrating the revolution.

During a panel at a fan convention in 2024, Kenny recounted a moment from a previous convention when he was asked by a neurodivergent fan whether &quot;SpongeBob himself [is] autistic as a character&quot;, to which he responded &quot;Yes, of course he is. [...] That&#x27;s his superpower, the same way that&#x27;s your superpower.&quot; Video footage of this account went viral, prompting Kenny to clarify during an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; at the convention three days later that he did not intend for this to be an official public statement about the character, and called it a &quot;private moment that I had with a fan, but it seems like it&#x27;s been empowering and helpful to people out there.&quot; A decade prior, on the &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot; podcast, Kenny described SpongeBob as being &quot;a little autistic. Obsessed with his job, very hardworking, gets really really deep into something.&quot; Fans on online forums have noted other behavior exhibited by SpongeBob can be interpreted as signs of neurodivergence, such as &quot;meltdowns, blindness to sarcasm and inability to read social cues&quot;. Other &quot;SpongeBob&quot; voice actors, including Mr. Lawrence and Clancy Brown, have agreed that the character of SpongeBob connects with autistic children and adults &quot;at every level of the spectrum&quot;.

==Merchandising==
SpongeBob&#x27;s translated well into related merchandise sales. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls sold at a rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob was popular in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon&#x27;s parent company Viacom purposefully targeted its marketing at women there as a way to build the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character&#x27;s design is very different from the already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. The character inspired a soap-filled sponge product manufactured by SpongeTech.

In early 2009, the Simmons Jewelry Co. released a $75,000 diamond pendant as part of a &quot;SpongeBob&quot; collection.

On May 17, 2013, Build-A-Bear Workshop introduced a new &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; collection in stores and online in North America.

SpongeBob also inspired an automobile design. On July 13, 2013, Toyota, with Nickelodeon, unveiled plans for a &quot;SpongeBob&quot;-inspired Toyota Highlander. The 2014 Toyota Highlander concept vehicle was launched as part of a SpongeBob Day promotion at that day&#x27;s game between the Giants and Padres in San Diego, and subsequently visited seven U.S. locations including the Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando in Florida.

<doc id="192347" wikidata="Q618604" url="?curid=192347" title="National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics">
<text>The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was a United States federal agency that was founded on March 3, 1915, to undertake, promote, and institutionalize aeronautical research. On October 1, 1958, the agency was dissolved and its assets and personnel were transferred to the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NACA is an initialism, i.e., pronounced as individual letters, rather than as a whole word (as was NASA during the early years after being established).

Among other advancements, NACA research and development produced the NACA duct, a type of air intake used in modern automotive applications, the NACA cowling, and several series of NACA airfoils, which are still used in aircraft manufacturing.

During World War II, NACA was described as &quot;The Force Behind Our Air Supremacy&quot; due to its key role in producing working superchargers for high altitude bombers, and for producing the laminar wing profiles for the North American P-51 Mustang. NACA also helped in developing the area rule that is used on all modern supersonic aircraft, and conducted the key compressibility research that enabled the Bell X-1 to break the sound barrier.

==Origins==

NACA was established on March 13, 1915, by the federal government through enabling legislation as an emergency measure during World War I to promote industry, academic, and government coordination on war-related projects. It was modeled on similar national agencies found in Europe: the French &quot;L&#x27;Etablissement Central de l&#x27;Aérostation Militaire&quot; in Meudon (now &quot;Office National d&#x27;Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales&quot;), the German Aerodynamic Laboratory of the University of Göttingen, and the Russian Aerodynamic Institute of Koutchino (replaced in 1918 with the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI), which is still in existence). The most influential agency upon which the NACA was based was the British Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.

In December 1912, President William Howard Taft had appointed a National Aerodynamical Laboratory Commission chaired by Robert S. Woodward, president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Legislation was introduced in both houses of Congress early in January 1913 to approve the commission, but when it came to a vote, the legislation was defeated.

Charles D. Walcott, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1907 to 1927, took up the effort, and in January 1915, Senator Benjamin R. Tillman, and Representative Ernest W. Roberts introduced identical resolutions recommending the creation of an advisory committee as outlined by Walcott. The purpose of the committee was &quot;to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution, and to determine the problems which should be experimentally attacked and to discuss their solution and their application to practical questions&quot;. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote that he &quot;heartily [endorsed] the principle&quot; on which the legislation was based. Walcott suggested the tactic of adding the resolution to the Naval Appropriations Bill.

According to one source, &quot;The enabling legislation for the NACA slipped through almost unnoticed as a rider attached to the Naval Appropriation Bill, on March 3, 1915.&quot; The committee of 12 people, all unpaid, were allocated a budget of $5,000 per year.

President Woodrow Wilson signed it into law the same day, thus formally creating the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, as it was called in the legislation, on the last day of the 63rd Congress.

The act of Congress creating NACA, approved March 3, 1915, reads, &quot;...It shall be the duty of the advisory committee for aeronautics to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution. ... &quot;

==Research==

On January 29, 1920, President Wilson appointed pioneering flier and aviation engineer Orville Wright to NACA&#x27;s board. By the early 1920s, it had adopted a new and more ambitious mission: to promote military and civilian aviation through applied research that looked beyond current needs. NACA researchers pursued this mission through the agency&#x27;s impressive collection of in-house wind tunnels, engine test stands, and flight test facilities.

In 1922, NACA had 100 employees. By 1938, it had 426. In addition to formal assignments, staff were encouraged to pursue unauthorized &quot;bootleg&quot; research, provided that it was not too exotic. The result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs, including &quot;thin airfoil theory&quot; (1920s), &quot;NACA engine cowl&quot; (1930s), the &quot;NACA airfoil&quot; series (1940s), and the &quot;area rule&quot; for supersonic aircraft (1950s). On the other hand, NACA&#x27;s 1941 refusal to increase airspeed in their wind tunnels set Lockheed back a year in their quest to solve the problem of compressibility encountered in high speed dives made by the Lockheed P-38 Lightning.

The full-size Langley wind tunnel operated at no more than and the then-recent tunnels at Moffett could only reach . These were speeds Lockheed engineers considered useless for their purposes. General Henry H. Arnold took up the matter and overruled NACA objections to higher air speeds. NACA built a handful of new high-speed wind tunnels, and Mach 0.75 () was reached at Moffett&#x27;s wind tunnel late in 1942.

===Wind tunnels===


NACA&#x27;s first wind tunnel was formally dedicated at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory on June 11, 1920. It was the first of many now-famous NACA and NASA wind tunnels. Although this specific wind tunnel was not unique or advanced, it enabled NACA engineers and scientists to develop and test new and advanced concepts in aerodynamics and to improve future wind tunnel design.

# Atmospheric 5-ft wind tunnel (1920)
# Variable Density Tunnel (1922)
# Propeller Research Tunnel (1927)
# High-speed 11-in wind tunnel (1928)
# Vertical 5-ft wind tunnel (1929)
# Atmospheric 7- by 10-ft wind tunnel (1930)
# Full-scale 30- by 60-ft tunnel (1931)

==Influence on World War II technology==
In the years immediately preceding World War II, NACA was involved in the development of several designs that served key roles in the war effort. When engineers at a major engine manufacturer were having issues producing superchargers that would allow the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress to maintain power at high altitude, a team of engineers from NACA solved the problems and created the standards and testing methods used to produce effective superchargers in the future. This enabled the B-17 to be used as a key aircraft in the war effort. The designs and information gained from NACA research on the B-17 were used in nearly every major U.S. military powerplant of the Second World War. Nearly every aircraft used some form of forced induction that relied on information developed by NACA. Because of this, U.S.-produced aircraft had a significant power advantage above 15,000 feet, which was never fully countered by Axis forces.

After the war had begun, the British government sent a request to North American Aviation for a new fighter. The offered P-40 Tomahawk fighters were considered too outdated to be a feasible front line fighter by European standards, and so North American began development of a new aircraft. The British government chose a NACA-developed airfoil for the fighter, which enabled it to perform dramatically better than previous models. This aircraft became known as the P-51 Mustang.

==Supersonic research==

After early experiments by Opel RAK with rocket propulsion leading to the first public flight of a rocket plane, the Opel RAK.1, in 1929 and eventual military programs at Heinkel and Messerschmitt by Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, the US entered the race to supersonic planes and spaceflight in the 1940s. Although the Bell X-1 was commissioned by the Air Force and flown by Air Force test pilot Chuck Yeager, when it exceeded Mach 1 NACA was officially in charge of the testing and development of the aircraft. NACA ran the experiments and data collection, and the bulk of the research used to develop the aircraft came from NACA engineer John Stack, the head of NACA&#x27;s compressibility division. Compressibility is a major issue as aircraft approach Mach 1, and research into solving the problem drew heavily on information collected during previous NACA wind tunnel testing to assist Lockheed with the P-38 Lightning.

The X-1 program was first envisioned in 1944 when a former NACA engineer working for Bell Aircraft approached the Army for funding of a supersonic test aircraft. Neither the Army nor Bell had any experience in this area, so the majority of research came from the NACA Compressibility Research Division, which had been operating for more than a year by the time Bell began conceptual designs. The Compressibility Research Division also had years of additional research and data to pull from, as its head engineer was previously head of the high speed wind tunnel division, which itself had nearly a decade of high speed test data by that time. Due to the importance of NACA involvement, Stack was personally awarded the Collier Trophy along with the owner of Bell Aircraft and test pilot Chuck Yeager.

In 1951, NACA Engineer Richard Whitcomb determined the area rule that explained transonic flow over an aircraft. The first uses of this theory were on the Convair F-102 project and the F11F Tiger. The F-102 was meant to be a supersonic interceptor, but it was unable to exceed the speed of sound, despite the best effort of Convair engineers. The F-102 had actually already begun production when this was discovered, so NACA engineers were sent to quickly solve the problem at hand. The production line had to be modified to allow the modification of F-102s already in production to allow them to use the area rule. (Aircraft so altered were known as &quot;area ruled&quot; aircraft.) The design changes allowed the aircraft to exceed Mach 1, but only by a small margin, as the rest of the Convair design was not optimized for this. As the F-11F was the first design to incorporate this during initial design, it was able to break the sound barrier without having to use afterburner.

Because the area rule was initially classified, it took several years for Whitcomb to be recognized for his accomplishment. In 1955 he was awarded the Collier Trophy for his work on both the Tiger and the F-102.

The most important design resulting from the area rule was the B-58 Hustler, which was already in development at the time. It was redesigned to take the area rule into effect, allowing greatly improved performance. This was the first US supersonic bomber, and was capable of Mach 2 at a time when Soviet fighters had only just attained that speed months earlier. The area rule concept is now used in designing all transonic and supersonic aircraft.

NACA experience provided a model for World War II research, the postwar government laboratories, and NACA&#x27;s successor, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

NACA also participated in development of the first aircraft to fly to the &quot;edge of space&quot;, North American&#x27;s X-15. NACA airfoils are still used on modern aircraft.

==Chairmen==
==Transformation into NASA==
===Special Committee on Space Technology===
On November 21, 1957, Hugh Dryden, NACA&#x27;s director, established the Special Committee on Space Technology. The committee, also called the Stever Committee after its chairman, Guyford Stever, was a special steering committee that was formed with the mandate to coordinate various branches of the federal government, private companies as well as universities within the United States with NACA&#x27;s objectives and also harness their expertise in order to develop a space program.

Wernher von Braun, technical director at the US Army&#x27;s Ballistic Missile Agency would have a Jupiter C rocket ready to launch a satellite in 1956, only to have it delayed, and the Soviets would launch &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; in October 1957.

On January 14, 1958, Dryden published &quot;A National Research Program for Space Technology&quot;, which stated:

On March 5, 1958, James Killian, who chaired the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee, wrote a memorandum to the President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Titled, &quot;Organization for Civil Space Programs&quot;, it encouraged the President to sanction the creation of NASA. He wrote that a civil space program should be based on a &quot;strengthened and redesignated&quot; NACA, indicating that NACA was a &quot;going Federal research agency&quot; with 7,500 employees and $300 million worth of facilities, which could expand its research program &quot;with a minimum of delay&quot;.

<doc id="192352" wikidata="Q1247292" url="?curid=192352" title="Soap (TV series)">
<text>Soap is an American sitcom television series that originally ran on ABC from September 13, 1977, until April 20, 1981. The show was created as a nighttime parody of daytime soap operas, presented as a weekly half-hour prime time comedy. Similar to a soap opera, the show&#x27;s story was presented in a serial format, and featured melodramatic plotlines including alien abduction, demonic possession, extramarital affairs, murder, kidnapping, unknown diseases, amnesia, cults, organized crime, a communist revolution, and teacher-student relationships. In 2007, it was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-&quot;Time&quot;&quot;, and in 2010, the Tates and the Campbells ranked at number 17 in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Top Families&quot;.

The show was created, written, and produced by Susan Harris, and also executive produced by Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas. Each returning season was preceded by a 90-minute retrospective of the previous season. Two of these retrospectives were made available on VHS in 1994, but were not included on any DVD collections.

The show aired 85 episodes over the course of four seasons. Of these, eight episodes (including the final four) aired as one-hour episodes during the original run on ABC. These hour-long episodes were later split in two, yielding 93 half-hour episodes for syndication. Like most sitcoms of the era, &quot;Soap&quot; was videotaped rather than filmed, but this helped further its emulation of the daytime soap opera format, as most such productions were also videotaped. All episodes are available on Region 1 DVD in four box sets. There is a box set of Season 1 on Region 2 DVD. The series has rerun in syndication on local channels as well as on cable.

The show starred Katherine Helmond and Cathryn Damon as sisters and matriarchs of their own families. The cast also included several former soap opera actors. Robert Mandan (Chester Tate) had previously appeared on &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; as a leading man for Mary Stuart; Donnelly Rhodes (Dutch Leitner) had played the first husband of Katherine Chancellor on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;; Arthur Peterson Jr. (&quot;The Major&quot;) played Rev. John Ruthledge in the radio version of &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, while Caroline McWilliams appeared on the television version as Janet Mason Norris; and Marla Pennington (Leslie Walker) appeared for three years as Samantha Livingston Chandler on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Additionally, after the series ended, Lynne Moody (Polly Dawson) went in to appear in a recurring capacity on primetime soap opera &quot;Knots Landing&quot; (which also starred Ted Shackelford, who appeared on &quot;Soap&quot; in a guest appearance), and Roscoe Lee Browne appeared in a recurring guest role in the seventh season of &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;.

== Plot ==

&quot;Soap&quot; is set in the fictional town of Dunn&#x27;s River, Connecticut.

In the opening sequence of the first installment, the announcer says &quot;This is the story of two sisters—Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell&quot;. The Tates live in a wealthy neighborhood (the announcer calls it the neighborhood known as &quot;Rich&quot;). Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond) and her husband, Chester (Robert Mandan), are hardly models of fidelity, as their various love affairs result in several family mishaps, including the murder of Peter Campbell (Robert Urich), the stepson of her sister Mary (Cathryn Damon). Even though everyone tells Jessica about Chester&#x27;s continual affairs, she does not believe them until she sees his philandering with her own eyes. While out to lunch with Mary, Jessica spots Chester necking with his secretary, Claire (Kathryn Reynolds). Heartbroken, Jessica sobs in her sister&#x27;s arms. On later occasions, it becomes clear that Jess has always known on some level about Chester&#x27;s affairs but never allowed herself to process the information.

The wealthy Tate family employs a sarcastic butler/cook named Benson (Robert Guillaume). Benson clearly despises Chester, but has a soft spot for their son, Billy (Jimmy Baio). He also gets along with the Tates&#x27; daughter Corinne (Diana Canova) as well as their mother, Jessica; but doesn&#x27;t speak to the other daughter, Eunice (Jennifer Salt), although that later changed. Benson became a popular character and in 1979 left the Tates&#x27; employ to work for Jessica&#x27;s cousin, Governor Gene Gatling, on the spin-off series &quot;Benson&quot;, wherein his last name, DuBois, was revealed. The Tates had to hire a new butler/cook named Saunders (Roscoe Lee Browne), whose attitude is similar to that of Benson, but has a more formal personality.

Mary&#x27;s family, the Campbells, are working class, and as the series begins, her son Danny Dallas (Ted Wass), a product of her first marriage to Johnny Dallas, is a junior gangster-in-training. Danny is told to kill his stepfather, Burt Campbell (Richard Mulligan), Mary&#x27;s current husband, who, Danny is told, murdered his father Johnny, who was also a mobster. It is later revealed that Danny&#x27;s father was killed by Burt in self-defense. Danny refuses to kill Burt and goes on the run from the Mob in a variety of disguises. This eventually ends when Elaine Lefkowitz (Dinah Manoff), the spoiled daughter of the Mob Boss (Sorrell Booke), falls in love with Danny and stops her father, who then tells Danny he will have to marry Elaine or he will kill him. In the fourth season, it is revealed that Chester is Danny&#x27;s true father, the product of a secret affair between him and Mary before his marriage to Jessica. Mary&#x27;s other son, Jodie (Billy Crystal, in an early role), is homosexual, having a secret affair with a famous professional football quarterback, and contemplating a sex-change operation.

The first season ends with Jessica convicted of the murder of Peter Campbell. The announcer concludes the season by announcing that Jessica is innocent, and that one of five characters—Burt, Chester, Jodie, Benson, or Corinne—killed Peter Campbell. Chester later confesses to Peter&#x27;s murder and is sent to prison. He is soon released after a successful temporary insanity defense, due to a medical condition in his brain.

Other plot lines include Jessica&#x27;s adopted daughter Corinne courting Father Tim Flotsky (Sal Viscuso), who ended up leaving the priesthood, with the two eventually marrying and having a child who is possessed by the Devil; Chester being imprisoned for Peter&#x27;s murder, escaping with his prison mate Dutch, and being afflicted with amnesia after a failed operation; Jessica&#x27;s other daughter, Eunice, sleeping with a married congressman (Edward Winter), and then falling in love with Dutch; Mary&#x27;s stepson Chuck (Jay Johnson), a ventriloquist whose hostilities are expressed through his alter ego, a quick-witted dummy named Bob; Jessica&#x27;s love affairs with several men, including Donahue (John Byner) a private investigator hired to find the missing presumed-dead Chester, her psychiatrist, and a Latin American revolutionary known as &quot;El Puerco&quot; (&#x27;The Pig&#x27;; his friends just call him &quot;El&quot;) (Gregory Sierra); Billy Tate&#x27;s confinement by a cult called the &quot;Sunnies&quot; (a parody of Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s Unification Church, called the &quot;Moonies&quot; by its critics), and then his affair with his school teacher who becomes unhinged; Danny and his romantic trials after Elaine&#x27;s death with a black woman (Polly, played by Lynne Moody), a prostitute (Gwen, played by Jesse Welles), and Chester&#x27;s second wife (Annie,played by Nancy Dolman); and Burt&#x27;s confinement to a mental institution, his abduction by aliens while being replaced with an oversexed alien lookalike on Earth, and getting blackmailed by the Mob after becoming sheriff of their small town.

At the beginning of each episode, off-camera announcer Rod Roddy gives a brief summary of the convoluted storyline and remarks, &quot;Confused? You won&#x27;t be, after week&#x27;s episode of... &quot;Soap&quot;.&quot; At the end of each episode, he asks a series of life-or-death questions in a deliberately deadpan style—&quot;Will Jessica discover Chester&#x27;s affair? Will Benson discover Chester&#x27;s affair? Will Benson care?&quot; and concludes each episode with the trademark line, &quot;These questions—and many others—will be answered in the next episode of... &quot;Soap&quot;.&quot;

Richard Mulligan was originally considered for the part of Chester Tate, but director Jay Sandrich felt Mulligan would be more appropriate as Burt Campbell. Sandrich suggested Robert Mandan (whom he had directed on the &quot;Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;) for the role of Tate instead. Recalling the challenge of casting the role of Benson, Sandrich recalled, 

:We couldn&#x27;t find Benson. We had so much trouble with Benson. We were reading women, we were reading Orientals, we were reading—Asians, I&#x27;m sorry—we were reading Black women, we were reading Norwegians, anybody. We could not find that part... We were looking for Bob Guillaume, is what we were looking for. Somebody who had that demeanor and could deliver one-lines... I&#x27;d seen him as a performer... I didn&#x27;t see him do comedy, but I remembered the name. I didn&#x27;t know if he could do comedy, but he was such a dynamic personality. Just pay attention to him.

According to Sandrich, the actor cast to play Mary Campbell in the initial pilot was &quot;a very good actress, but she was just as neurotic as Mulligan, so that didn&#x27;t work.&quot; Concerned with selling the show to the network, Fred Silverman authorized re-shooting the pilot with Cathryn Damon.

== Pre-broadcast protests and controversy ==
In early March 1977, ABC screened the first two episodes of &quot;Soap&quot; for the executives of its 195 affiliate stations, many of whom were instantly appalled by the show&#x27;s emphasis on sex and infidelity. ABC was privately told by two of the affiliates, neither in a major market, that the show was &quot;raunchy&quot; and its subject matter unfit for television.

In June 1977, a &quot;Newsweek&quot; preview of the fall season written by Harry F. Waters panned the show while characterizing some of its basic plot elements incorrectly and offering exaggerated reports of its sexual content. Despite having not seen the pilot, Waters called the show a &quot;sex farce&quot; and claimed (erroneously) that the show included a scene of a Catholic priest being seduced in a confessional. Waters also stated:

Whether Waters&#x27; errors and misrepresentations were intentional or accidental is unknown.

Within days of the &quot;Newsweek&quot; report, a number of local and national religious organizations began to quickly mobilize against &quot;Soap&quot;, despite the fact that they also had not seen the pilot. Among these were the National Council of Churches, the United Church of Christ, the United Methodist Church, the National Council of Catholic Bishops and the Christian Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, the latter of which went so far as to divest itself of 2,500 shares of ABC stock &quot;because the board does not approve of programming related to the abuse of human sexuality, violence and perversion&quot;.

The Roman Catholic Church, led by its Los Angeles Archdiocese, also condemned the show and asked all American families to boycott it, saying, &quot;ABC should be told that American Catholics and all Americans are not going to sit by and watch the networks have open season on Catholicism and morality. [&quot;Soap&quot;] is probably one of the most effective arguments for government censorship of TV that has yet come along.&quot; In August, the Board of Rabbis of Southern California, representing the three branches of Judaism, joined the Catholic protest, saying that the show, yet to be aired, &quot;reached a new low&quot;.

Dr. Everett Parker of the United Church of Christ called &quot;Soap&quot; &quot;a low-life, salacious program&quot; and complained that the show would be airing when children would be able to watch it. (ABC had scheduled it on Tuesdays after &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, two of the most popular family television shows being broadcast at the time.)

The religious bodies organized a letter-writing campaign designed to pressure the show&#x27;s sponsors not to advertise on the network. Although some of the groups asked their members to watch the show first, and then inform ABC of their feelings about it, others began working hard to get ABC to cancel the show before it premiered. One ABC vice president was shocked to learn that his 11-year-old child was required by a parochial school teacher to write a letter of protest to ABC, asking it to take the show off the air. In the end, 32,000 people wrote letters to ABC, only 9 of which were in support of the show.

In addition to the religious protest, &quot;Soap&quot; also faced substantial pre-broadcast criticism from the International Union of Gay Athletes and the National Gay Task Force, both of which were concerned about the way the gay character Jodie Dallas and his professional football player lover would be portrayed.

To allay the concern of advertisers, some of whom had begun to cancel sponsorship of the program, ABC reluctantly dropped the price for commercial time from $75,000 per spot to $40,000 per spot. When &quot;Soap&quot; premiered on September 13, 1977, 18 out of 195 ABC affiliates refused to air the program, and others chose to broadcast it after 11p.m. By its second week on the air, 2 more affiliates dropped out, bringing the boycott to 20 stations. Boycotting affiliates included KDUB in Dubuque, Iowa; KMVT in Twin Falls, Idaho; KTVO in Kirksville, Missouri/Ottumwa, Iowa; KXON in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; WABG-TV in Greenwood, Mississippi; WBAK in Terre Haute, Indiana; WCCB in Charlotte, North Carolina; WJCL in Savannah, Georgia; WJZ in Baltimore; WKAB in Montgomery, Alabama; WOWK-TV in Huntington, West Virginia; WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina; and WYUR in Huntsville, Alabama.

In 1978, when WCCB gave up its ABC affiliation to former NBC affiliate WSOC-TV and became independent, the latter station aired the show starting with late-night summer repeats of the first season, then showed it in its regular prime time slot the following fall. Except for two individuals, the only angry calls came from people wondering what happened to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which could now be found on WRET (today&#x27;s WCNC-TV).

== &quot;The &quot;Soap&quot; Memo&quot; ==
Aside from the external protests, &quot;Soap&quot; was also subject to heavy internal revisions from ABC&#x27;s Broadcast Standards &amp; Practices department, which monitors the content of programs. Writer-creator Susan Harris had developed a story arc for &quot;Soap&quot; in the form of a &quot;show bible&quot; which traced all the major characters, stories and events for five seasons. The Standards &amp; Practices executives (commonly referred to as &quot;censors&quot;) reviewed this extensive bible as well as the script for the two-part pilot and issued a long memo to Harris voicing their concerns about various storylines and characters. In addition to the sexual material that was widely reported in the press, the censors also took issue with the show&#x27;s religious, political and ethnic content.

&quot;The &quot;Soap&quot; Memo&quot; was leaked to the press before the show premiered and was printed in its entirety in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on June 27, 1977. Among the notes were:

:* &quot;Please delete [the lines] &#x27;...the slut&#x27;, &#x27;that Polish slut&#x27;, &#x27;get your clothes off&#x27;, &#x27;it doesn&#x27;t grow back&#x27;, &#x27;transsexual&#x27;, &#x27;Oh my God&#x27;, &#x27;did it hurt?&#x27;&quot;
:* &quot;Substitute [the words] &quot;fruit&quot;, &quot;slut&quot;, &quot;tinker bell&quot;.&quot;
:* &quot;The CIA or any other government organization is not to be involved in General Nu&#x27;s smuggling operation.&quot; (This character and storyline, which dealt with a Vietnamese opium smuggler who becomes involved in the Tate family through Jessica&#x27;s long-lost son, was eventually removed from the show bible.)
:* &quot;In order to treat Jodie as a gay character, his portrayal must at all times be handled without &#x27;limp-wristed&#x27; actions&quot;
:* &quot;The colloquy between Peter and Jessica ... which relates to cunnilingus/fellatio is obviously unacceptable&quot;
:* &quot;The relationship between Jodie and the football player should be handled in such a manner that explicit or intimate aspects of homosexuality are avoided entirely.&quot;
:* &quot;Father Flotsky&#x27;s stand on liberalizing the Mass will have to be treated in a balanced, inoffensive manner. By way of example, the substitution of Oreos for the traditional wafer is unacceptable.&quot;

&quot;The &quot;Soap&quot; Memo&quot; also contained notes that were subsequently disregarded by the producers including:
:* &quot;Please change Burt Campbell&#x27;s last name to avoid association with the Campbell Soup Co.&quot;
:* &quot;Corinne&#x27;s affair with a Jesuit priest, her subsequent pregnancy as a result, and later exorcism, are all unacceptable.&quot;
:* &quot;Please direct Claire to dump the hot coffee in some part of Chester&#x27;s anatomy other than his crotch.&quot; (Susan Harris later responded to this note: &quot;so we didn&#x27;t—we poured it in his .&quot;)

&quot;The &quot;Soap&quot; Memo&quot; was a rare public look into the behind-the-scenes process at a major network and copies of the document were often found posted on the bulletin boards of television production companies and on studio sets as a rallying point against censorship. In addition, the specific details in the memo further fueled the growing debate regarding the controversial content of &quot;Soap.&quot;

== Premiere and critical reception ==
&quot;Soap&quot; premiered on Tuesday, September 13, 1977, at 9:30p.m. The episode was preceded by a disclaimer that the show &quot;was part of a continuing character comedy&quot; that included adult themes and that &quot;viewer discretion&quot; was advised. The disclaimer was both displayed on the screen and read by announcer Rod Roddy. It would remain throughout the first season before being dropped.

Much of &quot;Soap&#x27;s&quot; controversy, among liberals and conservatives alike, ironically helped sell the series to the general public. Fueled by six months of pre-show protests (as well as a solid lead-in from the hit shows &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley,&quot; and &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;), the first episode swept its time slot with a 25.6 rating and a 39% share of the national audience. Although ABC received hundreds of phone calls after the premiere, executives at the network described initial public reaction as &quot;mild&quot; with more calls in favor of the show than in protest. A University of Richmond poll found that 74% of viewers found &quot;Soap&quot; inoffensive, 26% found it offensive, and half of those who were offended said they planned to watch it the next week.

Initial reviews—somewhat clouded by the controversy—were mixed, with negative reviews predictably focusing on the show&#x27;s racy content. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the show &quot;a prolonged dirty joke&quot; that &quot;is without cleverness or style or subtlety. Its sex jokes are delivered by the shovelful, like manure.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the show &quot;forced and derivative&quot;, &quot;bland&quot; and &quot;predictable and silly&quot; while conceding that the sex is &quot;no more outrageous than daytime soapers, no more outspoken than &quot;Three&#x27;s Company.&quot;&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised the &quot;talented cast&quot; and singled out Jimmy Baio and Billy Crystal as &quot;sharp young comedians&quot;, but felt the show suffered from &quot;nastiness&quot; and &quot;lacked compassion&quot;.

On the more positive side, &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the show a good review saying that there was &quot;a heap of talent&quot; in the cast and asking &quot;Is it funny? Yes it is... and I guess that constitutes redeeming social value&quot;.

Harry F. Waters&#x27; 1977 &quot;Newsweek&quot; review proved prescient of conservative reaction when the following year, the National PTA declared &quot;Soap&quot; one of &quot;ten worst&quot; shows in television. In spite of this designation, &quot;Soap&quot; ranked #13 for the 1977–78 season and went on to gain positive critical reviews and high ratings over the rest of its four-year run.

== Later seasons and cancellation ==

Although the uproar against &quot;Soap&quot; subsided shortly after its premiere, the program continued to generate additional criticism for its relatively frank depictions of homosexuals, racial and ethnic minorities and the mentally ill, as well as its treatment of other taboo topics such as social class, marital infidelity, impotence, incest, sexual harassment, rape, student-teacher sexual relationships, kidnapping, organized crime, murder of and by cast members, and new age cults. Much of the criticism focused on the openly gay character of Jodie Dallas (Billy Crystal). &quot;Soap&quot; was among the earliest American primetime series to include an openly gay character who was a major part of the series. Some social conservatives opposed the character on religious grounds, while some gay rights activists were also upset with the character of Jodie, arguing that certain story developments reinforced distorted stereotypes such as his desire to have a sex change operation, or represented a desire to change or downplay his sexual orientation.

Before the start of the second season, ABC ran a 90-minute retrospective clip show called &quot;Who Killed Peter?&quot; in which Burt Campbell visits Jessica Tate in prison as she awaits the verdict of her murder trial. The two discuss each of the show&#x27;s individual characters and their possible motives for killing Burt&#x27;s son Peter using flashbacks to illustrate specific story lines. The show was designed to remind viewers of what happened in Season 1 to prepare them for the upcoming season.

At the start of season three, another 90-minute retrospective aired in which Jessica says goodbye to Benson, using the flashback clips to try to explain why he should stay. This show also served to help launch the spinoff &quot;Benson&quot;, which was premiering at the start of the 1979–80 television season.

A third 90-minute retrospective titled &quot;Jessica&#x27;s Wonderful Life&quot; aired at the start of Season 4. Jessica, who had just died in the hospital, found herself in heaven speaking to an angel (played by Bea Arthur). Jessica explained via the flashback clips why she was not ready to die and had to return to earth to help her family.

Although Susan Harris had planned for five seasons of &quot;Soap&quot;, the program was abruptly canceled by ABC after its fourth season. Therefore, the final one-hour episode, which originally aired on April 20, 1981, did not serve as a series finale and instead ended with several unresolved cliffhangers. These involve a suicidal Chester preparing to kill Annie (his wife) and Danny (his biological son) after catching them in bed together, a hypnotized Jodie believing himself to be a 90-year-old Jewish man, Burt preparing to walk into an ambush orchestrated by his political enemies, Jessica about to be executed by a Communist firing squad, and Chester and El Puerco challenging each other to a duel. Vlasic Foods pulled its sponsorship of the program shortly after this episode aired and ABC announced that the program was not renewed for its planned fifth season. The official reason given by the network was its declining ratings. However, according to the Museum of Broadcast Communications, &quot;Soap&quot; &quot;ended under suspicion that resistance from ad agencies may have caused ABC to cancel [it] at that point&quot; because its still-controversial content was negatively affecting its relationship with sponsors.

A 1983 episode of &quot;Benson&quot; mentions Jessica&#x27;s disappearance, noting that the Tate family is seeking to have her declared legally dead. In the episode, Jessica appears as an apparition who only Benson can see or hear and reveals to him that she is not dead, but in a coma somewhere in South America. No other incidents from the final episode of &quot;Soap&quot; are mentioned, and the opening bars of the theme song for &quot;Soap&quot; play as she leaves the room.

== Legacy ==
Since its cancellation, &quot;Soap&#x27;s&quot; reputation has grown and it is often considered one of the best shows in television history. Much praise has been given to its &quot;exceptionally rich cast&quot; of performers &quot;such as was seldom seen on any serious dramatic show&quot;.

In a 1982 analysis in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, published as the series was entering syndication, TV critic Tom Carson lauded the ensemble, saying that &quot;the cast matches the best TV series rep troupes ever.&quot; Carson went on to note that &quot;Soap&quot; &quot;patently started out intended as a lampoon of middle-class values, and ended up instead as a weirdly offbeat celebration of them&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;Time&quot;, which initially panned the show, named it one of the &quot;100 Best Shows of All-&quot;TIME&quot;&quot;. The Museum of Broadcast Communications said that &quot;Soap&quot; is &quot;arguably one of the most creative efforts by network television before or after&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; called &quot;Soap&quot; a &quot;timeless comedy&quot; and concluded: &quot;Rarely does a show come along with such a unique voice and vision from the first episode&quot;.

British actress and comedian Catherine Tate, born Catherine Ford, changed her name after acquiring an Equity card, and chose her new surname based on Jessica Tate.

== Home media ==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released all four seasons of &quot;Soap&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Season 1 has been released on DVD in Region 2 in Norway (as &quot;Forviklingar&quot;), Sweden (as &quot;Lödder&quot;), Spain (as &quot;Enredo&quot;) and the UK. All four seasons have been released in Australia (Region 4).

Some of the episodes on these DVD collections are edited or replaced with the syndicated versions, shortened by as much as 2 to 3 minutes. Season 1 is also missing the disclaimer at the start of the show. In addition, the DVDs omit the three 90-minute &quot;Soap&quot; retrospective clips shows, which aired before each season began to remind the audience of what happened in the story during the previous season. The season 1 retrospective &quot;Who Killed Peter Campbell?&quot; and season 3 retrospective &quot;Jessica&#x27;s Wonderful Life&quot; were released on VHS in the 1990s.

On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library, including &quot;Soap&quot;. The company rereleased the first and second seasons on DVD on September 2, 2014, and &quot;Soap: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on June 2, 2015. Most of the episodes on the Mill Creek sets are the original, uncut ABC versions, and the &quot;On the last episode of &quot;Soap&quot;...&quot; synopses from the final season have been restored.
