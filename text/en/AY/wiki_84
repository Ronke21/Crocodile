<text>Peter Symonds College is a sixth form college in Winchester, Hampshire, England. The college is recognised as the largest sixth form in England and is noted for the high number of its students which progress to Oxbridge.

Peter Symonds College traces its origins to Christes Hospitall, a charitable institution established through the will of Peter Symonds, a prosperous Tudor merchant. In 1896 the charity established the College as a grammar school for boys.

Peter Symonds serves as the official sixth-form college of the Falkland Islands, housing a boarding house named Falkland Lodge. It is one of the very few sixth form colleges which also serve as a boarding school.

== History ==

=== The Life of Peter Symonds ===
Peter Symonds was born in Winchester in 1528, the son of the city&#x27;s bailiff John Symonds and his wife Joan, during the reign of King Henry VIII. Peter was sent to London in 1542, where he served as an apprentice to William Wilkinson, a London sheriff and alderman. Following the death of William Wilkinson in 1543, Peter continued in the service of his widow, Joan. Joan had served as a silkwoman in Anne Boleyn&#x27;s household, and was close friends with leading Protestant reformers, most notably the Oxford Martyrs: Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley, and Hugh Latimer.

When the reformers were imprisoned for their beliefs during the early years of the reign of Queen Mary I, Joan Wilkinson acted as their advocate and supplied them with necessities. Archbishop Cranmer advised her to leave England and promote Protestantism from the safety of the continent. After Bishops Ridley and Latimer were executed, Joan became a religious exile in Frankfurt, where she died in December 1556 at the house of her cousin, Cuthbert Warcop, a London mercer, and his wife, Anne. Her place of burial is unknown. Joan Wilkinson&#x27;s will opens with a declaration that she was in &quot;voluntarie exile for the true religion of Christ&quot;, and among her bequests were £6 13&quot;s&quot;. 4&quot;d&quot;. left to Peter Symonds who was still living in London.

Symonds became a successful mercer, and was one of the three wardens of the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1583. He married Anne Symonds by 1576 and moved to the parish of All Hallows, Lombard Street, at about this time. In 1582, he was among the richest of the city, and one of the two richest men in his parish. J. N. Hare attributes this wealth to the cloth trade that &quot;dominated London&#x27;s exports&quot;.

By his death, sometime between 24 April 1586 and 29 July 1587, he had accumulated a large amount of land in the South East of England. In his will, he left land and property in Chadwell and West Ham in Essex, and a farm at East Shalford in Surrey, to his wife. Then following her death, he directed that a group of trustees, including his brother William, Mr. Bilson as warden of the New College at Winchester, and four others, should secure a licence and an act of parliament for an almshouse to be constructed at Winchester named Christes Hospital. In addition, he left annual payments for a number of charitable purposes, including the poor of All Saint, Lombard Street and Chadwell in Essex.

It was this almshouse that was to become Peter Symonds College; however, legal struggles over Symonds&#x27; land delayed construction. Richard Symonds, who claimed to be Peter&#x27;s sole heir, occupied the property at Ingleby in Chadwell and Temple Marsh in West Ham before selling them, breaking the terms of Peter&#x27;s will. By 1600, after reportedly paying £280, the Winchester city corporation secured the land. It is unknown when exactly the almshouse was constructed, though it was in progress in 1604, and has been accepted to be complete by 1607. King James I gave royal consent for the hospital in 1615, thus giving the hospital legal status.

=== Early years as a grammar school ===
In 1896 permission was obtained from the Charity Commissioners to establish a grammar school for boys. The school was opened in 1897 with 59 boys in temporary accommodation in 39 Southgate Street. Mr Telford Varley, who had been second master at the Royal Grammar School in Guilford became the school’s Headmaster. By the end of 1899 the permanent school buildings were opened at the present site.

In 1906 approval was obtained from the Board of Education and the County’s Director of Education to build a house for the Headmaster.

In 1913 the amalgamation was organised with Trafalgar House School. This was a school based in Trafalgar Street, just below Westgate. It had been run for a 100 years by the Naish family. The number of pupils at Peter Symonds before the amalgamation was about 150 and 35 boys joined from Trafalgar House.

After World War I the library was built as a war memorial to pupils and Old Symondians who had died in the war. Within only two years the number of pupils had risen to 200 to 250. Telford Varley retired as headmaster in 1926. He was replaced by Dr. Percy Tom Freeman, who had worked at King Edward VI School, Southampton as head of Science.

=== Later years as a state school ===

The School continued to grow under Dr Freeman as headmaster until after World War II when the state education system was established and Peter Symonds became a voluntary controlled school. This resulted in the abolition of fees and free textbooks were provided. Dr Freeman was due to retire in 1957 but died in harness in August 1956. The school now had 650 pupils and needed extra accommodation. Dr Freeman was replaced by John Shields who was headmaster from 1957 to 1963. The school received funds to expand and provide more accommodation to meet the needs of the school.

The late 1960s saw the rise of comprehensive education. The Hampshire County Council reorganised education in the county rapidly whilst other counties dragged their feet to maintain their grammar schools. It was decided to make Peter Symonds a sixth form college during this time and other schools in the Winchester area would be feeders providing education for the years 11 to 16. John Ashurst left in 1971 to be replaced by Stuart Nicholls who had the task of overseeing the change in the status of the school to sixth form college. The school became a college in 1974 and the last grammar school intake left in 1979. In the early 1990s Neil Hopkins replaced Stuart Nicholls as Principal of the college.

In 1991 the Trustees of the Alms Houses, Christ’s Hospital, arranged for the remaining portion of Peter Symonds’ Foundation to be amalgamated with the Winchester Charity, known as St. John’s Hospital and Allied Charities.

In the late 1990s or early 2000s, for reasons unknown (but possibly because of the difficulty students and correspondents had in spelling the college&#x27;s name correctly), the College dropped the possessive apostrophe from its founder&#x27;s name in its official title, and is now known as &quot;Peter Symonds College&quot;.

== College life ==

=== Admissions ===
The college has 5000 students aged 16–18, mainly from central Hampshire, but also British Forces teenagers from Germany and Cyprus, and residents of the Falkland Islands, who live on campus in one of the two boarding houses, Falkland Lodge and School House. The Falkland Islands Government pays for each student to board at Peter Symonds if they achieve at least five &quot;C&quot; grades in their GCSEs. Therefore, in 2005 principal Neil Hopkins described the institution as &quot;the official sixth-form college for the Falkland Islands&quot;. The college has a separate site in Winchester where it provides courses for some 2000 adult students.

=== Curriculum ===
Most students at Peter Symonds take three A levels, with some taking other vocational courses. However, some students take four or more A levels in their first year and continue with either three or four A levels in their second year. The Level 3 Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) is offered at the college.

Amongst the subjects on offer at the college are Fine Art, Photography, Three-Dimensional Design, Textiles, Biology, Business, Chemistry, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Criminology, Dance, Drama, Economics, English Language, English Literature, Environmental Studies, Film Studies, French, German, Geography, Politics, Graphics, Health &amp; Social Care, History, ICT, Law, Italian, Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Media Studies, Music, Philosophy, PE, Physics, Product Design, Psychology, Religious Studies, Sociology, Spanish and Statistics. The college is one of the few sixth form colleges offering Latin at both AS and A level.

Courses are available at AS Level, A-level, BTEC Level 2 National Certificate, BTEC Level 3 National Certificate and GCSE at the college.

=== Extra-curricular activities ===
At one time the college produced an online magazine named &quot;The BUZZ&quot;, written and edited by students, which replaced &quot;Converse&quot; in 2008 but has since ceased to circulate. There was a student produced college radio station, 7Radio, operating until roughly 2014. This was revived in 2022, establishing the student-led Symonds Radio, who currently produce ad-hoc programming in partnership with Outreach Radio.

The UK Rock Challenge, Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award, First Aid, Practical Wildlife Conservation, Choir, Harry Potter Appreciation Society, Libra Foundation, Fencing, Debating and Fantasy Football are all activities on offer at Peter Symonds College.

=== Boarding ===
Approximately eighty students board at the school circa 2005. Students board at the two houses; School House and Falkland Lodge. Boarders are typically from British Armed Forces families or the Falkland Islands. The college and the Falkland Islands government made an agreement for the college to accommodate students from the Falkland Islands. A second boarding house, Falkland Lodge, was built as part of this agreement, and was funded by the Falkland Islands. 
There were more boarding houses when the college was a boys&#x27; grammar school: Wyke Lodge, which is now the environmental studies block, and Kelso, which is home to the music department.

=== Sports ===
The college has teams in the following sports: athletics, American flag football, badminton, basketball, cheerleading, cricket, cross country, equestrian, football, hockey, lacrosse, netball, rugby, squash, swimming, tennis, skiing, sailing, and volleyball. The college enters individual players and teams into competitions for the following sports: Golf, table tennis and trampolining.

=== Students&#x27; Union ===
The Peter Symonds College Student Union works in conjunction with Student Services to promote student interests alongside organising events for the student body, such as diversity festivals, guest speakers, charity events, concerts and end of year balls. The SU consists of the Executive Committee (President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary) and other officers (Canteens and Environment, Entertainments and Charity, Communications, Equality and Diversity, Officer without Portfolio and others). The Students&#x27; Union has a history of organising and coordinating protests and demonstrations on behalf of the student body.

The President of the SU also serves on the Board of Governors as a student governor, along with one other student governor who need not be a member of the Executive Committee. Amongst the roles of the President is to chair the executive committee, and to organise and chair the Student Parliament.

The Students&#x27; Union officers are elected at the start of the academic year with the executive committee elected at the year&#x27;s end. Participation in the elections has been boosted in recent years through the use of an online system accessible through the student intranet, this system was introduced for the first time in the executive committee election of April 2012. The electoral system works on a single transferable vote system, with a re-open nominations option available.

The Student Union is affiliated with the National Union of Students. The college is entitled to send two voting delegates to the Union Conference.

;AS Results 2015

2015 results showed the pass rate remained at 99% and students performed better than last year, with 83% achieving A*-C at A Level.

=== Buildings ===
In 2004, the John Shields Building was unveiled, providing classrooms for the computing, psychology and environmental science departments. Also in that year the Varley Sports Café was rebuilt.

The £4.2M Ashurst Learning Resources Centre was completed in the spring of 2007. Ashurst contains five computer suites, housing over 170 computers (three suites double as classrooms, but remain open access when not in use), a library and silent study areas.

The Conlan building was completed in the summer of 2014, this building is used for a variety of subjects including Photography and Business. It includes a green screen which is used by photography and media students.

The Hopkins Building, named after previous principal Neil Hopkins, was previously known as the Ashurst Quad. It sits alongside the Ashurst (LRC) was opened in September 2015, creating more study space for students. The ground floor of the building is dedicated to the provision of computers and student workspaces, whilst the top floor is occupied by the Geography and Latin departments.

On 21 April 2023, the Carville building was opened which was named after previous principal Stephen Carville. The two-storey building includes 12 classrooms and primary houses the Business and Economics departments.

The college plans to open a new art complex to replace the current art classrooms. More than 150 local residents have backed a campaign to prevent the construction of the new building. The new complex will be open to the public, and local residents have expressed concerns of a potential safety problem due to the location of a planned new entrance to the college site.

<text>USS &quot;Wisconsin&quot; (BB-9), an pre-dreadnought battleship, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the 30th state. She was the third and final member of her class to be built. Her keel was laid down in February 1897 at the Union Iron Works in San Francisco, and she was launched in November 1898. The completed ship was commissioned into the fleet in February 1901. The ship was armed with a main battery of four guns and she had a top speed of .

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; served as the flagship of the Pacific Fleet from her commissioning to 1903; during this period, she made one long distance cruise to American Samoa in late 1901. In 1903, she was transferred to the Asiatic Fleet, where she served as the Northern Squadron flagship. She returned to the United States in late 1906, where she was overhauled extensively. In July 1908, she joined the Great White Fleet for the second leg of its cruise around the world, which lasted until February 1909. The ship remained in service with the Atlantic Fleet until early 1910, when she was reduced to reserve status.

The vessel was employed as a training ship starting in 1912, primarily for cadets from the US Naval Academy. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, &quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s training duties expanded to engine room personnel. She was also assigned to the Coast Battleship Patrol Squadron. She took part in a naval review in December 1918 after the war ended. She served briefly with the fleet in 1919, though by May 1920, she was decommissioned. The old battleship, thoroughly obsolete by this time, was sold for scrap in January 1922 and broken up.

==Description==
Design work on the of pre-dreadnought battleships began in 1896, at which time the United States Navy had few modern battleships in service. Initial debate over whether to build a new low-freeboard design like the s in service or a higher-freeboard vessel like (then under construction) led to a decision to adopt the latter type. The mixed secondary armament of guns of previous classes was standardized to just 6-inch weapons to save weight and simplify ammunition supplies. Another major change was the introduction of modern, balanced turrets with sloped faces instead of the older &quot;Monitor&quot;-style turrets of earlier American battleships.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by eight coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which were ducted into a pair of funnels placed side by side. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were replaced by cage masts in 1909. She had a crew of 531 officers and enlisted men, which increased to 690–713.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four /35 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of fourteen /40 caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; carried four  torpedo tubes in deck mounted torpedo launchers.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had of armor plating on their exposed sides. Armor that was 6 in thick protected the secondary battery. The conning tower had thick sides.

== Service history==
===Pacific and Asiatic Fleets===
The keel for &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was laid down on 9 February 1897 at the Union Iron Works in San Francisco. She was launched on 26 November 1898 and was commissioned into the fleet on 4 February 1901. The ship steamed out of San Francisco on 12 March for initial training in Magdalena Bay, Mexico from 17 March to 11 April. She was back in San Francisco on 15 April for repairs, which lasted until 28 May. She then left for Port Orchard, Washington, arriving on 1 June. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; stayed there for nine days before returning to San Francisco. Later that month, she joined the battleships and &quot;Iowa&quot;, the protected cruiser , and the torpedo boat for a tour of the west coast of the United States. They arrived in Port Angeles, Washington on 29 June and proceeded to Port Whatcom, Washington on 2 July, where they took part in Independence Day celebrations. The following day, they returned to Port Angeles and took part in training exercises, which lasted to mid-July.

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; entered the drydock at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington on 23 July for repairs that lasted until 14 October. She then sailed to Honolulu, Hawaii, arriving on 23 October. There, she took on coal and continued on to American Samoa, conducting gunnery training while en route. She arrived in Tutuila on 5 November, and stayed with the collier and the hospital ship for about two weeks before steaming to Apia in German Samoa. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; left the island on 21 November for Hawaii, from which she continued on to Central America. She arrived in Acapulco, Mexico on 25 December and remained there for three days to coal. She made visits to Callao, Peru and Valparaíso, Chile before returning to Acapulco on 26 February 1902. The ship then conducted a wide variety training exercises in Magdalena Bay and Pichilinque Bay from 5 to 22 March, before steaming up the west coast of the United States, stopping in Coronado, San Francisco, and Port Angeles. She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 4 June for repairs that lasted until 11 August.

The ship took part in gunnery training off Tacoma and Seattle before additional maintenance at Puget Sound on 29 August. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; departed Washington on 12 September bound for Panama—then still part of Colombia—to protect American interests in the country. She was by this time serving as the flagship of the Pacific Squadron, under Rear Admiral Silas Casey III. The Thousand Days&#x27; War was being waged in Panama, and so Casey brought representatives from the two sides aboard &quot;Wisconsin&quot; for negotiations that ultimately ended the conflict. The ship left Panama on 22 November and steamed back to San Francisco, arriving on 5 December. On the 9th, Casey transferred his flag to the armored cruiser . &quot;Wisconsin&quot; then conducted gunnery training until 17 December, followed by another period in drydock at Puget Sound from 20 December to 13 May 1903. She was then assigned to the Asiatic Fleet; she coaled in Honolulu before arriving in Yokohama, Japan on 12 June. Rear Admiral Philip H. Cooper, the commander of the Northern Squadron, Asiatic Fleet hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Wisconsin&quot; on 15 June.
&quot;Wisconsin&quot; spent the next three years in the Asiatic Fleet; during this time, her routine consisted of operations off north China and Japan in the summer and in the Philippines in the winter. She visited numerous East Asian ports, including Kobe, Yokohama, Nagasaki in Japan and Amoy, Shanghai, Yantai, Nanjing, and Taku in China. The ship left the Asiatic Fleet on 20 September 1906 when she departed Yokohama, bound for Honolulu. After coaling there from 3 to 8 October, she proceeded to San Francisco, arriving on 18 October. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; spent a week there before steaming north to Puget Sound, where she was decommissioned on 16 November for a lengthy overhaul that lasted until the end of April 1908. She then steamed south to San Francisco, where she arrived on 6 May to take part in a naval review there. She was back in Puget Sound on 21 May to have new fire control equipment installed; the work lasted until 22 June.

===Great White Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet===
The ship then steamed back down to San Francisco in early July. There, she joined the Great White Fleet, which had departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, the previous year on the first leg of its global cruise. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression.

The Great White Fleet then began its crossing of the Pacific, with a visit to Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909. There, they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt.
&quot;Wisconsin&quot; steamed out of Hampton Roads on 6 March for Portsmouth, New Hampshire, arriving on the 9th. There, she entered the drydock for repairs and modifications, including a new gray paint scheme. After returning to service in June, she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, and she joined her unit in Hampton Roads at the end of the month. She immediate steamed back north for Portland, Maine, where she participated in Independence Day celebrations on 4 July. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; rejoined the fleet in Hampton Roads on 6 August for gunnery training off the Virginia Capes. Routine maintenance was performed at Hampton Roads during this period. In late September, she steamed to New York for the Hudson–Fulton Celebration. The celebration saw an international fleet of warships from Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and other countries join the Atlantic Fleet to commemorate Henry Hudson&#x27;s discovery of the Hudson River. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; left the ceremonies on 5 October for repairs at Portsmouth, which lasted from 7 October to 28 November. She then returned to Hampton Roads, by way of Newport, Rhode Island, where she embarked sailors assigned to the Atlantic Fleet.

The ship conducted exercises with the rest of the fleet off the Virginia Capes until the middle of December, when she departed for New York, where she would spend Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day. In early January 1910, she steamed south to Cuban waters for exercises. During this period, which lasted from 12 January to 19 March, she was based in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. After the conclusion of the exercises, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; made visits to Tompkinsville, New York, and New Orleans, Louisiana. On 22 April, she arrived back in New York, where she unloaded her stocks of ammunition, before proceeding to the Portsmouth Navy Yard. There, she was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was transferred to Philadelphia in April 1912 and later that year she participated in a naval review, which was held off Yonkers, New York. The ship then returned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet; she was placed in ordinary on 31 October 1913. In early 1915, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was assigned to the United States Naval Academy Practice Squadron, along with the battleships and . The three ships made a cruise to the Pacific coast via the recently completed Panama Canal; &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was the third battleship to transit the canal since its opening.

=== World War I ===

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; continued in her service as a training ship into 1917; she was in the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 6 April when the United States declared war on Germany, entering World War I. On the 8th, the ship began to receive men from the Naval Militia to flesh out her crew. She was placed in full commission on 23 April and was assigned to the Coast Battleship Patrol Squadron, along with &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Ohio&quot;, commanded by Commander David F. Sellers. On 6 May, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; steamed to the Virginia Capes, arriving in Yorktown, Virginia the next day. From then to early August, the ship was employed as a training ship for engine room personnel in the Chesapeake Bay area. She then took part in squadron exercises from 13 to 19 August; these included the battleships , , , , &quot;Ohio&quot;, &quot;Missouri&quot;, and . &quot;Wisconsin&quot; then proceeded to Port Jefferson, New York for additional exercises.

The ship then steamed to the York River in the western Chesapeake in early October, followed by a short period in drydock at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 30 October to 18 December. She returned to the Chesapeake, where she remained into early 1918. More repairs at Philadelphia followed from 13 May to 3 June, after which she steamed to Annapolis. While en route, she received orders to cruise close to shore, as the German submarine had been operating in the area since 23 May, and had sunk several ships. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; reached Annapolis on 7 June, having stopped in the Delaware River to wait for &quot;U-151&quot; to depart. A contingent of 175 midshipmen came aboard &quot;Wisconsin&quot; on 8 June for a training cruise to the Chesapeake. On 29 August she returned to Annapolis and disembarked the midshipmen before returning to Yorktown the next day. There, she took on 217 men for another round of training. On 11 November, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the fighting in Europe. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; continued in her training ship duties until 20 December, when she was sent to New York for a naval review for Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt on 26 December.

Following the German surrender in November 1918, most of the battleships of the Atlantic Fleet were used as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and her sisters were not so employed, however, owing to their short range and small size, which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; instead steamed to Cuba for training with the Atlantic Fleet into 1919. She went on a midshipmen training cruise to the Caribbean in mid-1919. On 15 May 1920, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was decommissioned; she was reclassified as BB-9 on 17 July. She was eventually sold on 26 January 1922 and broken up for scrap.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Massillon, CO (24 June 1663 – 28 September 1742), was a French Catholic prelate and famous preacher who served as Bishop of Clermont from 1717 until his death in Beauregard-l&#x27;Évêque.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Massillon was born at Hyères in Provence where his father was a royal notary. At the age of eighteen he joined the French Oratory and taught for a time in the colleges of his congregation at Pézenas, and Montbrison and at the Seminary of Vienne. On the death of Henri de Villars, Archbishop of Vienne, in 1693, he was commissioned to deliver a funeral oration, and this was the beginning of his fame. In obedience to Cardinal de Noailles, Archbishop of Paris, he left the Trappist Abbey of Sept-Fons, to which he had retired, and settled in Paris, where he was placed at the head of the Oratorian Seminary of Saint Magloire.

===Career===
Massillon soon gained a wide reputation as a preacher and was selected to be the Advent preacher at the court of Versailles in 1699. He was made Bishop of Clermont in 1717, and two years later was elected a member of the Académie française. The last years of his life were spent in the faithful discharge of his episcopal duties; his death took place at Clermont on September 18, 1742. Massillon enjoyed in the 18th century a reputation equal to that of Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet and of Louis Bourdaloue, and was much praised for his eloquence by Voltaire, D&#x27;Alembert and kindred spirits among the Encyclopaedists.

Massillon&#x27;s popularity was probably because in his sermons he lays little stress on dogmatic questions, but treats generally of moral subjects, in which the secrets of the human heart and the processes of man&#x27;s reason are described with poetical feeling. He has usually been contrasted with his predecessor Bourdaloue, the latter having the credit of vigorous denunciation, Massillon that of gentle persuasiveness. Besides the &quot;Petit Carême&quot;, a sermon which he delivered before the young King Louis XV of France in 1718, his sermons on the Prodigal Son, on the small number of the elect, on death, for Christmas Day, and for the Fourth Sunday in Advent, may be perhaps cited as his masterpieces. His funeral oration on King Louis XIV of France is only noted now for the opening sentence: &quot;&quot;Dieu seul est grand.&quot; (Only God is great.) But, in truth, Massillon is singularly free from inequality. His great literary power, his reputation for benevolence, and his known toleration and dislike of doctrinal disputes caused him to be much more favourably regarded than most churchmen by the philosophers of the 18th century.

The first edition of Massillon&#x27;s complete works was published by his nephew, also an Oratorian (Paris, 1745–1748), and upon this, in the absence of manuscripts, succeeding reprints were based. The best modern edition is that of the Abbé Blampignon (Paris, 1865–1868, 4 vols.; new ed. 1886).

<text>USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was a Continental Army sloop-of-war that served in Lake Champlain during the American Revolutionary War. She was the first of a long and prestigious line of ships of the United States or by the combatant forces of the U.S. Revolutionary War to bear the name &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

==Service history==
===Built in St. Johns, Quebec===
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was originally a British supply sloop named &quot;George&quot;, built at St. Johns (now Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu) in Quebec, Canada.

===Raid on St. Johns===
In May 1775, a small American force under Colonel Benedict Arnold sailed up the Richelieu River on the recently captured . At 07:00 on 18 May, Arnold and 35 raiders captured the fort and shipyards at St. Johns, along with the newly launched &quot;George&quot;, with no loss of life. The unlaunched schooner was also at the shipyard, and would be captured by the Americans later that year. Two hours later Arnold&#x27;s raiders left with the newly captured sloop, which was later armed with 12 guns and renamed &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

===Siege of St. Johns===

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was, at first, the most significant warship in the Lake Champlain squadron – which was charged with maintaining American control of the lake early in the war – and at times she acted as flagship for Colonel Arnold. Control of Lake Champlain and the adjoining Hudson River would have enabled the British to cut off vital supply routes between New England and the other colonies, and it would have allowed British troops to cross and attack Albany.

On 28 August 1775, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and other vessels embarked with more than 1,000 troops as part of an expedition against St. Johns, Montreal, and Quebec. Though St. Johns and Montreal were captured, and Quebec was besieged, the arrival of strong British reinforcements forced the Americans to withdraw from Canada in the spring of 1776. &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the other craft sailed to Île aux Noix in the Richelieu River, where they waited while Arnold directed the building of a fleet at Fort Ticonderoga and Skenesboro (now Whitehall).

===Battle of Valcour Island===

The battle was finally joined in the Battle of Valcour Island on 11 October 1776 at Valcour Island, near Plattsburgh, New York, a site of Arnold&#x27;s choosing. Markedly inferior in firepower, much of Arnold&#x27;s fleet was sunk or damaged by nightfall. However, he managed to slip the remaining ships, including &quot;Enterprise&quot;, past the British fleet that night towards Fort Crown Point. A running battle took place over the next two days, and resulted in the loss of all but five of the American ships. &quot;Enterprise&quot; and four others escaped to Crown Point, then sailed on to Ticonderoga.

====Aftermath of the Battle of Valcour Island====
Although a tactical defeat, the battle was a strategic victory for the Americans. Arnold and his little fleet had disrupted the British invasion into New York such that it could not be mounted before the onset of winter. It was nearly a year before the advance could be renewed. In that interval American troops were recruited and trained, and on 17 October 1777, under General Horatio Gates, defeated the British decisively at Saratoga, New York. This victory was a primary factor in bringing about the alliance with France, and bringing the powerful French navy to the aid of the Colonies.

===Siege of Fort Ticonderoga===

During the British advance prior to the Battle of Saratoga, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was one of five vessels assigned to duty convoying bateaux in the evacuation of Ticonderoga. The small American force was no match for the British fleet on Lake Champlain, and after two ships had been captured, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the other two were run aground on 7 July 1777, and burned to prevent their capture.

<text>The Osborne Computer Corporation (OCC) was an American computer company and pioneering maker of portable computers. It was located in the Silicon Valley of the southern San Francisco Bay Area in California.
Adam Osborne, the founder of the company, developed, with design work from Lee Felsenstein, the world&#x27;s first mass-produced portable computer, the Osborne 1, in 1981.

==History==
===Osborne 1===
After Adam Osborne sold his computer book-publishing company to McGraw-Hill in 1979, he decided to market an inexpensive portable computer with bundled software and hired Lee Felsenstein to design it. The resulting Osborne 1 featured a 52-column cathode-ray tube display, two floppy-disk drives, a Z80 microprocessor, and 64 KB of RAM. It could fit under an airplane seat and survive being accidentally dropped. The bundled software package included the CP/M operating system, the MBASIC and CBASIC programming languages, the WordStar word processing package, and the SuperCalc spreadsheet program. It also included project management software with PERT and GANTT charts, and communications software for a 300 baud modem. Osborne obtained the software in part by offering stock in the new Osborne Computer Corporation, which he founded in January 1981. For example, MicroPro International received 75,000 shares and $4.60 for each copy of WordStar Osborne distributed with his computers.

Unlike other startup companies, Osborne Computer Corporation&#x27;s first product was ready soon after its founding. The first Osborne 1 shipped in July 1981, and its low price set market expectations for bundled hardware and software packages for several years to come. The company sold 11,000 Osborne 1s in the eight months after its July 1981 debut, with 50,000 more on backorder, although the early units had a 10–15% failure rate. The peak sales per month for it over the course of the product lifetime was 10,000 units, despite the initial business plan for the computer predicting a total of only 10,000 units sold over the entire product lifecycle. Osborne had difficulty meeting demand, and the company grew from two employees, Osborne and Felsenstein, to 3,000 people and $73 million in revenue in 12 months. The growth was so rapid that, in one case, an executive who returned from a one-week trade show had to search two buildings to find her relocated staff. The company announced in October 1982 a temporary bundling of Ashton-Tate&#x27;s dBase II, increasing demand so much that production reached 500 units a day and severely diminishing quality control.
In 1982, Osborne was originally represented in Australia exclusively by President Computers Pty Ltd headed by Tom Cooper, a captain of industry in the emerging Australian PC era. With outstanding success of Osborne 1 sales in Australia, President Computers was lauded at the time by Osborne Corp USA as the largest global distributor of Osborne 1 luggable computers outside of Computerland USA. However with success, Osborne&#x27;s visiting CFO had his own sights on the Australian market place and convinced Adam Osborne to split the Agency much to Cooper&#x27;s objection. This move saw President Computers equally divide its current Dealership arrangement when Osborne Corporation setup to hold half the dealership Agency. Upon this decision President Computers exclusivity signed on Osborne&#x27;s luggable rival the US Del Mar CA manufactured Kaypro Computer produced by Non Liner Systems which boasted a larger format in-built screen. 

Cooper held a trusted business relationship with Adam Osborne and was privy to an early viewing of the yet to be released new Osborne Executive. On sighting warehouses full of the first model, Cooper cautioned Osborne that the Osborne II should only be announced once the original Osborne 1 stock had been depleted. Ultimately, dismissing such advice contributed to Osborne Corporation&#x27;s demise and Chapter 11 filing in September 1983. Osborne Corporation in Australia was then restructured and moved towards the PC sector but retained use of the Osborne brand. By this time President Computers also had successfully enjoyed strong success with Kaypro luggable computer sales had itself moved into the PC Sector under its own private label brand with Cooper&#x27;s President Computer PC Assembly plant officially opened on the Gold Coast Technology Park, 1 Computer Street, Labrador Queensland in 1986 by Minister for Industry, Small Business and Technology of Queensland Hon. Mike Ahern.

===Competition===
Despite early success, Osborne struggled under heavy competition. Kaypro Computer offered portables that, like the Osborne 1, ran CP/M and included a software bundle, but Kaypro offered larger screens. Apple Computer&#x27;s offerings had a large software library of their own and with aftermarket cards, could run CP/M as well. IBM&#x27;s PC was faster, more advanced, and offered a rapidly growing software library, and Osborne&#x27;s efforts to raise $20 million in capital to rush an IBM-compatible computer to market were unsuccessful.

===The Osborne effect===

According to proponents of the Osborne effect theory, Adam Osborne damaged his company&#x27;s current sales when he began showing the Osborne Executive to journalists in early 1983. Dealers rapidly started cancelling orders for the Osborne 1 in anticipation of the new Executive. Unsold inventory piled up and in spite of dramatic price cuts – the Osborne 1 was selling for $1295 in July 1983 and $995 by August – sales did not recover. Losses, already higher than expected, continued to mount, and OCC declared bankruptcy on September 13, 1983. Disagreement exists on whether the Osborne Effect truly caused the company to collapse, with Robert X. Cringely and Charles Eicher attributing its failure to other causes.

===Bankruptcy===
When it was apparent that the company would be closing down, a company meeting was held with all employees. The first round of layoffs involved sales staff, production staff, domestic marketing and most mid to low-level clerical support. These employees were presented with their paychecks only. The management that remained was primarily from the international marketing division.

Nine days later on September 22, 1983, a group of 24 investors filed suit against OCC and several individuals, seeking $8.5 million in damages for masking the company&#x27;s true financial situation and accusing several directors of the company of insider trading. Osborne emerged from bankruptcy in 1984 and released the Osborne Vixen, a compact portable running CP/M, in late 1984, along with the Morrow Pivot-based Osborne 3 (known as the Osborne Encore overseas). However, the company never regained its early prominence. A last-ditch effort to create a fully IBM-compatible Osborne produced three prototypes, but too late to save the company from bankruptcy.

Commercial rights for the Osborne brand name were later acquired by the Finnish clone PC maker Mikrolog Ltd which sold its server and desktop PCs domestically under the previously world famous name until 2021, when Mikrolog went bankrupt.

<text>This is a list of heads of state of Iceland, including Kings of Norway from 1262 to 1814, Kings of Denmark from 1814 to 1918, the King of Iceland from 1918 to 1944 and Presidents of Iceland from 1944.

== Overview ==

Iceland was settled in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, principally by people of Norwegian and other Scandinavian origin. In 930, the ruling chiefs established a republican constitution and an assembly called the Althing—the oldest parliament in the world. Iceland remained independent until 1262, when it entered into a treaty which established a union with the Norwegian monarchy. In the late 14th century Norway and Denmark entered into a union. The union between Denmark and Norway, ignoring some shorter periods, lasted until 1814, when Norway briefly gained independence, and Iceland became an integral part of Denmark until 1918, when Iceland was recognised as a fully sovereign state in personal union with Denmark under a common monarch, on 1 December that same year.

Following a constitutional referendum between 20 and 23 May 1944, Iceland formally became an independent republic on 17 June 1944. Since Denmark was still occupied by Germany, many Danes felt offended that the step should have been taken at the time . Still, the last King of Iceland, Kristján X, sent a message of congratulations to the Icelandic people.

<doc id="196697" wikidata="Q1548371" url="?curid=196697" title="USS Enterprise (1799)">
<text>The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was a schooner, built by Henry Spencer at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1799 for the United States Navy. Her first commander thought that she was too lightly built and that her quarters, in particular, should be bulletproofed. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was overhauled and rebuilt several times, effectively changing from a twelve-gun schooner to a fourteen-gun topsail schooner and eventually to a brig. &quot;Enterprise&quot; saw action in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean again, capturing numerous prizes. She wrecked in July 1823.

== First Caribbean tour ==
Lieutenant John Shaw was commissioned as the first captain of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. On 17 December 1799, during the Quasi-War with France, &quot;Enterprise&quot; departed the Delaware Capes for the Caribbean to protect United States merchantmen from the depredations of French privateers. On 23 January she recaptured the American schooner &quot;Victory&quot;, captured 5 days earlier by the privateer &quot;Sun&quot;. The next day she recaptured another ship, the brig &quot;Androscoggin&quot;, captured 6 days earlier by the privateer &quot;La Union&quot;. She left Curacao around the end of January 1800 and on 3 February received orders from Commodore Thomas Truxtun to sail home with dispatches.

==Second Caribbean tour==
Returning to the West Indies, on 23 April 1800, she had a brief engagement with a Spanish packet that opened fire on her, but broke off the fight upon realizing that the ship was a neutral. On 5 May, she captured the French 4-gun schooner &quot;Citoyen&quot;, which suffered 4 killed and 11 wounded. On 17 June she captured a second privateer, &quot;Le Cigne&quot;, off Guadeloupe. &quot;Le Cigne&quot; suffered 11 killed and 13 wounded. On 9 July she captured &quot;L&#x27;Aigle&quot;, and on 23 July she captured privateer &quot;Le Flambeau&quot;. the French suffered 4 killed and 29 wounded, while &quot;Enterprise&quot; had 2 wounded. On 13 August, she recaptured the American schooner &quot;Washington&quot; eight leagues northeast of Deseada, captured by privateer &quot;Le Pauline&quot; on 15 August (). On 7 September, she captured the letter of marque lugger &quot;Guadaloupian&quot;. On 24 October, Captain Shaw asked to be relieved of command, due to ill health. Commodore Truxton granted his request and promoted Shaw&#x27;s first officer, Lt. Andrew Sterret, to Captain. Sterret officially took command on 27 October. On 6 December, she fought a night engagement with a privateer lugger that started one league off St Bartholomew&#x27;s, ending close to shore when she broke off rather than risk being wrecked on the unfamiliar island. The privateer suffered 20 killed, 30 wounded, and lost 2 masts. On 24 December, she captured her last privateer, the schooner &quot;La Amour de la Patrie&quot;, before sailing home. 
In a letter dated 20 February 1801 to Josiah Parker, chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, Navy Secretary Benjamin Stoddert recommended selling off &quot;Enterprise&quot; to reduce naval expenses. She was placed in ordinary on 26 February while her naval stores were unloaded. She was docked at Baltimore on 17 November 1801, still up for sale, when the outbreak of war forced the Navy to hastily recommission her for service.

== First arrival in the Mediterranean ==
&quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed to the Mediterranean from Hampton Roads. The need for new masts delayed her departure until early May 1801. She sailed from Hampton Roads 1 June. The squadron she was assigned to cleared the Cape on 2 June. She reached Gibraltar on 26 June 1801, joining other American ships fighting in the First Barbary War.

=== Battle with corsair &quot;Tripoli&quot; ===
&quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; first action came on 1 August 1801 when, seven leagues west of Malta, she defeated the 14-gun Tripolitan polacca corsair &quot;Tripoli&quot;, after a fierce but one-sided battle. &quot;Enterprise&quot; emerged unscathed, while the battered &quot;Tripoli&quot; was dismasted and sent back into port.

The action was described in Washington City&#x27;s &quot;National Intelligencer &amp; Adv.&quot; on 18 November 1801:
NAVAL VICTORY
&lt;br&gt;
Yesterday captain Sterret, commander of the schooner &quot;Enterprize&quot;, part of the Mediterranean squadron, arrived here, with dispatches for the Secretary of the Navy.
&lt;br&gt;
Captain Sterret is bearer of dispatches from commodore Dale, which exhibit a detailed account of the proceedings and situation of the Mediterranean squadron.
&lt;br&gt;
On the 1st of August, the schooner &quot;Enterprize&quot;, commanded by captain Sterret, and carrying 12 six pounders and 90 men, bound to Malta for a supply of water, fell in with a Tripolitan cruizer, being a ship of 14 six pounders, manned by 80 men.
&lt;br&gt;
At this time the &quot;Enterprize&quot; bore British colours. Captain Sterret interrogated the commander of the Tripolitan on the object of his cruize. He replied that he came out to cruise after the Americans, and that he lamented that he had not come alongside of some of them. Captain Sterret, on this reply, hoisted American, in the room of British colours; and discharged a volley of musquetry; which the Tripolitan returned by a partial broadside.—This was the commencement of a hard fought action, which commenced at 9 am and continued for three hours.
&lt;br&gt;
Three times, during the action, the Tripolitan attempted to board the &quot;Enterprize&quot;, and was as often repulsed with great slaughter, which was greatly increased by the effective aid afforded by the Marines. Three times, also, the Tripolitan struck her colours, and as often treacherously renewed the action, with the hope of disabling the crew of captain Sterret, which, as is usual, when the enemy struck her colours, came on deck, and exposed themselves, while they gave three cheers as a mark of victory.
&lt;br&gt;
When for the third time, this treacherous attack was made, captain Sterret gave orders to sink the Tripolitan, on which a scene of furious combat ensuded, until the enemy cried for mercy.
&lt;br&gt;
Captain Sterret, listening to the voice of humanity, even after such perfidious conduct, ordered the captain either to come himself, or to send some of his officers on board the &quot;Enterprize&quot;. He was informed that the boat of the Tripolitan was so shattered as to be unfit for use. He asked, what security there was, that if he should send his men in his own boat, they would not be murdered?
&lt;br&gt;
After numerous supplications &amp; protestations the boat was sent: The crew of the Tripolitan was discovered to be in the most deplorable state. Out of eighty men, 20 were killed, and 30 wounded. Among the killed were the second lieutenant and Surgeon; and among the wounded were the Captain and first lieutenant. And so decisive was the fire of the &quot;Enterprize&quot; that the Tripolitan was found to be in a most perilous condition, having received 18 shot between wind and water.
&lt;br&gt;
When we compare this great slaughter, with the fact that not a single individual of the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was in the least degree injured, we are lost in surprise at the uncommon good fortune which accompanied our seamen, and at the superior management of Captain Sterrett.
&lt;br&gt;
All the officers and sailors manifested the truest spirit, and sustained the greatest efforts during the engagement. All, therefore, are entitled to encomium for their valour and good conduct. The marines, especially, owing to the nearness of the vessels, which were within pistol shot of each other, were eminently useful.
&lt;br&gt;
After administering to the relief of the distresses of the wounded Tripolitans, and the wants of the crew, Capt. Sterrett ordered the ship of the enemy to be completely dismantled. Her masts were accordingly all cut down, and her guns thrown overboard. A spar was raised, on which was fixed, as a flag, a tattered sail; and in this condition the ship was dismissed.
&lt;br&gt;
On the arrival of the Tripolitan ship at Tripoli, so strong was the sensations of shame and indignation excited there, that the Bey ordered the wounded captain to be mounted on a Jack Ass, and paraded thro&#x27; the streets as an object of public scorn. After which he received 500 bastinadoes.
&lt;br&gt;
So thunderstruck were the Tripolitans at this event, and at the apprehended destruction of their whole marine force, that the sailors, then employed at Tripoli on board of cruisers that were fitting out by the government, all deserted them, and not a man could be procured to navigate them.
On 3 February 1802, Congress resolved that Sterett receive a commemorative sword to mark his victory; the rest of &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s crew received a month&#x27;s pay.

== Remainder of Mediterranean patrol ==
At Gibraltar on 3 October 1801, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was ordered to return to Baltimore with dispatches for the Secretary of the Navy. She reached American shores in November 1801. While in port, Sterett received orders on 17 November to pay off and discharge the crew. He was advised that he would receive a furlough and replaced after he oversaw the ship&#x27;s refitting. Master Commandant Silas Talbot was initially set to assume command but had already resigned from the Navy in September. Sterett was ultimately retained as captain as no other suitable replacements were available. 
With a new crew, &quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed from Baltimore on 12 February 1801 for continued service in the Mediterranean as an escort for merchantmen. 

On 16 October 1802 at Leghorn, her supply barge capsized and was lost along with a midshipman and three crewmen; the survivors were rescued by a boat from USS &quot;Constellation&quot;.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; next saw action when the war resumed in 1803, after months of carrying dispatches, convoying merchantmen, and patrolling the Mediterranean. On 17 January, she captured &quot;Paulina&quot;, a Tunisian ship under charter to the Bashaw (Pasha) of Tripoli, and on 22 May, she ran a 30-ton falucca (?) craft ashore on the coast of Tripoli during an exchange of fire with shore batteries, then fought off an attack by Tripolitan gunboats the next day. For the next month, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and other ships of the squadron cruised inshore, bombarding the coast and sending landing parties to burn small enemy vessels.

On 9 November 1803, Lieutenant Stephen Decatur assumed command of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, exchanging commands with Lieutenant Isaac Hull, who took command of the USS &quot;Argus&quot;. On 23 December 1803, after a quiet interval of cruising, &quot;Enterprise&quot; joined with frigate &quot;Constitution&quot; to capture the Tripolitan ketch &quot;Mastico&quot;. The captured vessel was taken back to Syracuse and refitted and renamed . Decatur took command of &quot;Intrepid&quot;, while Lt. Commandant John H. Dent temporarily assumed captaincy of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Because of her regional appearance, the ketch was well suited for making its way into Tripoli&#x27;s harbor without raising suspicion and was thus used in a daring expedition to board, capture and burn the frigate &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, captured by the Tripolitans and anchored in the harbor of Tripoli. Decatur and volunteers from &quot;Enterprise&quot; carried out their mission almost perfectly, destroying the frigate and depriving Tripoli of a powerful warship. After the mission to destroy &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, Decatur resumed his original command. 

&quot;Enterprise&quot; continued to patrol the Barbary Coast until July 1804, when she participated in coordinated American naval bombardments and attacks on the city of Tripoli over a period of several weeks, bringing the war to an end.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; passed the winter in Venice, where she completed refurbishment and resupply by May 1805. She rejoined her squadron in July and resumed patrol and convoy duty until August 1807. During that period, she fought (15 August 1806) a brief engagement off Gibraltar with a group of Spanish gunboats that attacked her but which she was able to drive off. &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to the United States in late 1807 and cruised coastal waters until June 1809. After a brief tour in the Mediterranean, she sailed to New York and was laid up for nearly a year.

== 1811 recommissioning ==
Repaired at the Washington Navy Yard, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was recommissioned there in April 1811, then sailed for anti-piracy operations out of Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. She returned to Washington on 2 October and was hauled out of the water for extensive repairs and modifications: when she sailed on 20 May 1812, she had been rerigged as a brig.

At sea when war was declared on Britain, she cruised along the east coast during the first year of hostilities. On 5 September 1813, &quot;Enterprise&quot; sighted and chased the brig . The brigs opened fire on each other, and in a closely fought, fierce, and gallant action which claimed the lives of both commanding officers, &quot;Enterprise&quot; captured &quot;Boxer&quot; and, under the guidance of her new captain Samuel Drinkwater, took her into nearby Portland, Maine, where commandant Edward McCall oversaw a joint funeral for Lieutenant William Burrows of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and Captain Samuel Blyth of &quot;Boxer&quot;, both well-known and highly regarded in their respective naval services. Both Burrows and Blyth were buried in the Eastern Cemetery in Portland, near the grave of Commodore Edward Preble.

== Second Caribbean patrol ==
After repairing at Portland, &quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed in company with brig for the Caribbean. The two ships took three prizes before being forced to separate by a heavily armed British ship on 25 February 1814. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was compelled to jettison most of her guns in order to outsail her superior antagonist. The brig reached Wilmington, North Carolina, on 9 March 1814, then passed the remainder of the war as a guardship off Charleston, South Carolina.

== Mediterranean, New Orleans, and West Indies squadrons ==

&quot;Enterprise&quot; served one more short tour in the Mediterranean Squadron (July–November 1815), then cruised the northeastern seaboard until November 1817. In 1818, she was under the command of Lieutenant Lawrence Kearny of the New Orleans Squadron, who evicted the pirate Jean Lafitte from Galveston, Texas. From that time on she sailed the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico as one of the founding vessels of what later became the West Indies Squadron in 1821. She was active in suppressing pirates, smugglers, and slavers; in this duty she took thirteen prizes. An attack on Cape Antonio, Cuba in October 1821 resulted in the rescue of three vessels taken by pirates, and the breaking up of an outlaw flotilla reputedly commanded by James D. Jeffers, aka &quot;Charles Gibbs&quot;.

==Fate==
&quot;Enterprise&quot;″s career ended on 9 July 1823, when she stranded and broke up on a reef near Little Curacao Island in the West Indies. Her crew successfully evacuated and suffered no casualties.

==Legacy==
For her illustrious career, the ship earned the nickname &quot;Lucky Enterprise&quot;. The yacht that defended the 1930 America&#x27;s Cup was named after her, and sailed with a model of her in the captain&#x27;s cabin.

<doc id="196698" wikidata="Q1748740" url="?curid=196698" title="Monty Python Sings">
<text>Monty Python Sings is a compilation album of songs by English comedy troupe Monty Python. Released in 1989 to celebrate their 20th anniversary, it contains popular songs from their previous albums and films. The album was dedicated to the memory of founding member Graham Chapman, who died two months before its release.

==Songs==

The album contained two previously unreleased tracks: &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; (originally performed by John Cleese on the 1960s radio series &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;) was recorded during sessions for &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot; in 1980, while a studio recording of Terry Gilliam&#x27;s live standard &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Two Legs&quot; was recorded in 1974 for the Drury Lane shows, where it was to be mimed onstage, but discarded once Gilliam decided to perform it live instead. The album also has a longer version of &quot;Medical Love Song,&quot; with added instrumentation and previously unheard verses which mix out Eric Idle&#x27;s guide vocals and push Graham Chapman&#x27;s lead vocal to the forefront. The remixes of &quot;Sit on My Face&quot; and the extended &quot;Henry Kissinger&quot; from &quot;The Final Rip Off&quot; were also used, as well as a new mix of &quot;Bruces&#x27; Philosophers Song (Bruces&#x27; Song)&quot; and a remix of the 1975 George Harrison-produced single version of &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;, featuring some alternate vocal takes. This was the first compilation to include tracks from the &quot;Life of Brian&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; soundtracks, albeit in remixed form. &quot;Every Sperm Is Sacred&quot; is the extended version, previously only available on the B-side of the 7-inch single of &quot;Galaxy Song&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover design by Terry Gilliam marked his first original album artwork since 1977&#x27;s &quot;Instant Record Collection&quot;. The original vinyl release contained a booklet featuring illustrated lyrics to all the songs.

==Reissues==
Although the album did not chart on its original 1989 release, it was re-promoted following the successful reissue of &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; in 1991, when it reached No. 62 in the UK Albums Chart.

On 30 June 2014, the album was re-released as &quot;Monty Python Sings (Again)&quot; on CD and as a digital download, expanded with six additional recordings: three out-takes from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot; and three new tracks from Eric Idle, recorded for inclusion in the team&#x27;s reunion shows &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;. A deluxe edition in both formats also included the 1970 &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; album. This version of the album reached No. 35 in the UK Albums Chart.

To celebrate the team&#x27;s 50th anniversary, a double vinyl album set of &quot;Monty Python Sings (Again)&quot; was released on 4 October 2019, now including the Stephen Hawking version of &quot;Galaxy Song,&quot; first released as a limited edition 7-inch single for Record Store Day on 18 April 2015.

<text>Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve (; 3 January 1756 – 18 June 1794) was a French writer and politician who served as the second mayor of Paris, from 1791 to 1792, and the first regular president of the National Convention in 1792. During the French Revolution, he was associated with the moderate Girondins, and voted against the immediate execution of Louis XVI at the king&#x27;s trial in January 1793, though he supported a suspended sentence. This led to Pétion&#x27;s proscription by the Convention alongside other Girondin deputies following the radical insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793, and ultimately his suicide together with fellow-Girondin François Buzot while evading arrest during the Terror.

==Early life and work==
Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve was the son of a prosecutor at Chartres. Though it is known that he was trained as a lawyer, very few specifics are known about Petion&#x27;s early life, as he was virtually unknown prior to the French Revolution. He became a lawyer in 1778, and at once began to try to make a name in literature. His first printed work was an essay, &#x27;, which failed to gain the prize for which it was composed, but pleased Brissot so much that he printed it in vol. vii. of his &#x27;.

Pétion&#x27;s next works, &#x27;, and &#x27;, in which he advocated the marriage of priests, confirmed his position as a bold reformer. He also attacked long-held &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; traditions such as primogeniture, accusing it of dividing the countryside into &quot;proletarians and colossal properties.&quot; Later works penned by Pétion include his account of Haiti entitled &quot;&quot; (1790) and &quot;&quot; in which he chides France for its corruption.

When the elections to the Estates-General took place in 1789, he was elected a deputy to the Tiers Etat for Chartres. Both in the assembly of the Tiers Etat and in the Constituent Assembly Pétion showed himself a radical leader. Although Petion was overshadowed in the Assembly by such orators as Mirabeau and Barnave, his close relationship with Girondin leader Brissot provided him with helpful advice on political conduct. He supported Mirabeau on 23 June, attacked the queen on 5 October, and was elected president on 4 December 1790. On 15 June 1791, he was elected president of the criminal tribunal of Paris. On 21 June 1791, he was chosen one of three commissioners appointed to bring back the king from Varennes, and he has left an account of the journey. After the last meeting of the assembly on 30 September 1791, Robespierre and Pétion were made the popular heroes and were crowned by the populace with civic crowns.

==Mayor of Paris==
From 24 October - 11 November Pétion visited London and had dinner with Thomas Paine. By late 1791, administrative control of Paris was dominated by the Jacobins and mayor Jean-Sylvain Bailly had resigned due to constant political attacks from the left. Pétion received a still further proof of the affection of the Parisians for him on 16 November 1791, when he was elected second mayor of Paris in succession to Bailly in a contest against Lafayette. (Only 10% of eligible citizens cast a vote, and Pétion won 60% of votes cast). In his mayoralty he exhibited clearly his republican tendency and his hatred of the old monarchy, especially on 20 June 1792, when he allowed the mob to overrun the Tuileries and insult the royal family. For neglecting to protect the Tuileries he was suspended from his functions on 6 July by Louis Alexandre de La Rochefoucauld, the president of the Directory of the Seine &quot;département&quot;, but the leaders of the Legislative Assembly felt that Pétion&#x27;s cause was theirs, and rescinded the suspension on 13 July. The next day he was installed. On 4 August, at the head of the municipality of Paris, Pétion demanded the deposition of the king. Following news of the Duke of Brunswick&#x27;s Prussian Army and the Battle of Verdun (1792), fear encouraged frenzied Parisian mobs to target prisoners, royalist sympathizers, and Catholic priests in a series of acts of violence that would come to be known as the September Massacres.

==Convention, flight and death==
Pétion was elected to the for Eure-et-Loir and became its first president. After his election he stood down as Mayor of Paris and Nicolas Chambon de Montaux was elected to replace him. L.P. Manuel proposed that the president of the Assembly should have the same authority as the president of the United States; his proposition was at once rejected, but Pétion got the nickname of &quot;Roi Pétion,&quot; which contributed to his fall. With disagreements over such items as the necessity of the September Massacres, the Convention was a scene of large-scale political infighting between different factions. The Girondins represented the moderate Right in the while their more radical opponents, the Montagnards, represented the Left and were distinguished by their preference for occupying the higher rows of benches in the . As late as August 1792 he was still friends with Robespierre and, according to Marisa Linton, choosing a side was especially hard for him but in the end his friendship with Brissot proved stronger. Hence he chose the &quot;Girondin&quot; party, with which he voted for a suspended sentence of execution at the trial of Louis XVI, and in favor of the appeal to the people. He participated to the Constitution Committee that drafted the Girondin constitutional project. He was elected in March 1793 to the Committee of General Defense (the precursor of the Committee of Public Safety) and attacked Robespierre, who had accused him of having known and having kept secret Dumouriez&#x27;s project of restoring the French Constitution of 1791.

Pétion&#x27;s name was among those of the twenty-two Girondin deputies proscribed on 2 June 1793 (see Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793). Pétion was one of those who escaped to Caen and raised the standard of provincial insurrection against the ; and, when the Norman rising failed, he fled with Marguerite-Élie Guadet, François Nicolas Leonard Buzot, Charles Jean Marie Barbaroux, Jean-Baptiste Salle and Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvrai to the Gironde, where they were sheltered by a wigmaker in Saint Emilion. At last, a month before Robespierre&#x27;s fall on 27 July 1794, the escaped deputies felt themselves no longer safe, and deserted their asylum. Salle and Guadet were arrested on 18 June, taken to Bordeaux and guillotined the next day. Barbaroux was guillotined on 25 June after a botched suicide attempt on 18 June. The bodies of Pétion and Buzot, who had most likely succeeded in killing themselves on 18 June, were found in a field, half eaten by wolves, on 27 June. However, some historians disagree about how the two men actually died. H. Morse Stephens claims that they &quot;blew out their brains&quot; with a pistol, while Charles MacFarlane states that &quot;whether they had committed suicide by poison or by other means, or whether they had perished of hunger&quot; was impossible to say due to the decomposed state the bodies were found in.

<text>The fourth USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was a United States Navy schooner.

She was launched by the New York Navy Yard on 26 October 1831, and commissioned on 15 December 1831, Lieutenant S. W. Downing in command. &quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed on 12 January 1832 for South America where she patrolled the Brazil Station guarding United States&#x27; interests until April 1834. Returning to New York at that time, she repaired and refitted until July when she departed again for Brazil.

Ten months later she joined sloop for a cruise to the Far East by way of Africa, India and the East Indies. Continuing eastward, &quot;Enterprise&quot; called at Honolulu, Hawaii, in September 1836, then proceeded to the west coast of Mexico, arriving at Mazatlán on 28 October 1836. She cruised the west coast of South America until March 1839, when she departed Valparaíso, Chile to round the Horn, call at Rio de Janeiro, and sail on to Philadelphia. Here she was inactivated on 12 July 1839.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was recommissioned 29 November 1839, and on 16 March 1840, sailed from New York for South America. After four years of protecting U.S. commerce on this station, she turned north for home. In 1843 &quot;Enterprise&quot; was encountered by Chilean schooner &quot;Ancud&quot; at Puerto Americano in the fjords and channels of Patagonia. Deeming &quot;Enterprise&quot; to be engaging in contraband with the Yates family of local settlers Chilean-British commander John Williams Wilson had his men board &quot;Enterprise&quot; forcing her to leave. On 20 June 1844, &quot;Enterprise&quot; entered the Boston Navy Yard and four days later was decommissioned for the last time. She was sold 28 October 1844.

<text>The following is an overview of the events of 1895 in film, including a list of films released and notable births.

==Events==
* February–March – Robert W. Paul and Birt Acres build and run the first working 35 mm movie camera in Britain, the Kineopticon. Their first films include &quot;Incident at Clovelly Cottage&quot; (March), &quot;The Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Race&quot; (March 30) and &quot;Rough Sea at Dover&quot;.
* February 13 – In France, the brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière patent the &quot;Cinematographe&quot;, a combination lightweight, hand-held movie camera and projector. The several short films they create at this time are considered to be pivotal in the history of film.
* March 22 – Auguste and Louis Lumière make what is probably the first presentation of a projected celluloid film moving picture, the 46-second &quot;Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory&quot;, to members of the Société d&#x27;encouragement pour l&#x27;industrie nationale in Paris.
* May 27 – Birt Acres patents the Kineopticon under his own name.
* Late September – C. Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat demonstrate their Phantoscope, a motion picture projector, in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Cotton States and International Exposition.
* November 1 – In Germany, Max Skladanowsky and his brother Emil present a short film at the Berlin Wintergarten theatre using the movie projector they have developed.
* December 28 – Auguste and Louis Lumière make what is probably the first commercial public screening of projected moving picture films to a paying audience, at the Salon Indien du Grand Café in the Boulevard des Capucines in Paris. This date is sometimes considered the debut of the motion picture as an entertainment medium.
* December 30 – The American Mutoscope and Biograph Company motion pictures is founded in New Jersey by the KMCD Syndicate of William Kennedy Dickson, Henry Marvin, Herman Casler and Elias Koopman. Casler has manufactured the Biograph 68 mm camera, which becomes the first successful large format 68mm (70mm) film.
*Annabelle the Dancer is a sensation in shorts such as &quot;Annabelle Serpentine Dance&quot;.
*William Kennedy Dickson and his sister Antonia publish &quot;History of the Kinetograph, Kinetoscope, and Kinetophonograph&quot; in the United States with a preface by Thomas Edison, the first history of the subject.
*Gaumont Pictures founded by the engineer-turned-inventor, Léon Gaumont. Woodville Latham and his sons develop the Latham Loop – the concept of loose loops of film on either side of the intermittent movement to prevent stress from the jerky movement. This is debuted in the Eidoloscope, which is also the first widescreen format (1.85:1).
* Henri Joly debuts his Joly-Normandin 60 mm format.

<text>The fifth USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, a barque-rigged screw sloop, was launched 13 June 1874 at Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine, US, by John W. Griffiths, a private contractor; and commissioned 16 March 1877, Commander George C. Remey in command. She was later commanded by Bowman H. McCalla around 1890, followed by Commander Albert S. Barker from 1892 to 1896.

==Overview==
&quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s first duty after fitting out at Norfolk, Virginia, took her to the mouth of the Mississippi River for surveying operations. Returning to Norfolk in April 1878, she remained there only briefly, sailing 27 May for surveying duty up the Amazon and Madeira Rivers. On 1 October 1878 off the coast of Pará, Brazil, Seaman Thomas Smith rescued a fellow sailor from drowning, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. This surveying duty completed, she repaired at New York City, then in December 1878 joined the U.S. naval forces in European waters, calling at numerous ports in northern Europe and in the Mediterranean. She returned to the Washington Navy Yard on 9 May 1880 and was placed out of commission.

Recommissioned on 12 January 1882, she cruised the east coast until 1 January 1883 when she sailed on a three-year hydrographic survey that took her completely around the world. During this time, she was commanded by Albert S. Barker. Her findings on this cruise added materially to the knowledge of the oceans, their currents, and their bottoms. During the journey she was a neutral witness of the Battle of Fuzhou on 23 August 1884 during the Sino-French War. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was decommissioned at New York on 21 March 1886.

Placed back in commission on 4 October 1887, &quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed from Boston in January 1888 for two years in the waters of Europe, the Mediterranean, and the east coast of Africa, where she showed the flag and looked out for United States&#x27; interests. She returned to New York in March 1890 and was decommissioned on 20 May.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was again commissioned 8 July 1890, and for the next year operated principally in the Caribbean. From September 1891 until September 1892, she served as training and practice ship at the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland. On 17 October 1892 at Boston, she was lent to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for duty as a school ship at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. In that capacity she trained cadets for some 17 years (the current MMA training ship was named USTS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in honor of her until the name was changed to USTS &quot;Kennedy&quot;). Returned to the Navy on 4 May 1909, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was sold on 1 October 1909. The hulk was burned for salvage near Boston in 1910.

<text>François Nicolas Léonard Buzot (; 1 March 176024 June 1794) was a French politician and leader of the French Revolution.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born at Évreux, Eure, Buzot studied Law, and, at the outbreak of the Revolution was a lawyer in his home town. In 1789, he was elected a deputy of the Third Estate to the Estates-General, and became known there for his radical opinions. He demanded the nationalization of the possessions of the Roman Catholic Church, and the right of all citizens to bear arms.

After the dissolution of the National Constituent Assembly, Buzot returned to Évreux, where he was named president of the criminal tribunal.

===Convention===
In 1792, Buzot was elected deputy to the National Convention, and joined the Girondists under the influence of his friend Madame Roland. Buzot entered a polemic with the main rival of the Girondists, Jean-Paul Marat, and demanded the formation of a National Guard from the &quot;départements&quot; to defend the Convention against the Paris crowds of &quot;sans-culottes&quot;. His proposal was carried, but never put into force - the Parisians subsequently singled him out as a target of their hatred.

In the trial of King Louis XVI, Buzot voted in favour of the capital punishment death, but with appeal to the people and postponement of sentence (&quot;sursis&quot;). He had a sentence of death passed against the Royalist &quot;émigrés&quot; who did not return to France, and against anyone who should demand the re-establishment of the monarchy. At the same time, he opposed Georges Danton and The Mountain, and rejected the creation of a Committee of Public Safety and Revolutionary Tribunal (but abstained when the question of Marat&#x27;s trial before the Tribunal was brought up by the Girondists). On 5 May 1793, his servant was arrested in the Jardin du Luxembourg.

===Flight and resistance===
Proscribed with the Girondists on 2 June 1793, Buzot escaped, and took refuge to Calvados in Normandy, where he contributed to organize a Girondist insurrection against the convention, which was suppressed soon after.

The Convention prosecuted him, and decreed &quot;that the house occupied by Buzot be demolished, and never to be rebuilt on this plot. [Instead,] a column shall be raised, on which there shall be written: &quot;Here was the sanctuary of the villain Buzot who, while a representative of the people, conspired for the overthrow of the French Republic&quot;&quot;. He fled, together with Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve, to Saint-Émilion, near Bordeaux and remained in hiding. Both of them most likely committed suicide; their bodies were found in a field a week later, half-eaten by dogs. It is unclear whether the men used poison or shot themselves with a pistol, which is likely due to the decomposed state in which their bodies were found. 

Buzot&#x27;s house in Evreux was purposefully burnt to the ground, plus an effigy of Buzot, by a crowd on 27 July 1793.

Buzot left behind his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, first published in 1823.

<doc id="196709" wikidata="Q236554" url="?curid=196709" title="Madame Roland">
<text>Marie-Jeanne &quot;Manon&quot; Roland de la Platière (Paris, March 17, 1754 – Paris, November 8, 1793), born Marie-Jeanne Phlipon, and best known under the name Madame Roland was a French revolutionary, salonnière and writer. Her letters and memoirs became famous for recording the state of mind that conditioned the events leading to the revolution.

From a young age Roland was interested in philosophy and political theory and studied a broad range of writers and thinkers. At the same time she was aware that, as a woman, she was predestined to play another role in society than a man. After marrying the economist Jean-Marie Roland de la Platière, she did develop with him a husband and wife team which made it possible for her to engage in public politics.

She moved from Paris to Lyon, where she initially led a quiet and unremarkable life as a provincial intellectual with her husband. She became actively involved in politics when the French Revolution broke out in 1789. She spent the first years of the revolution in Lyon, where her husband was elected to the city council. During this period she developed a network of contacts with politicians and journalists. Her reports on developments in Lyon in letters to people in her network were published in national revolutionary newspapers.

In 1791 the couple settled in Paris, where Madame Roland soon established herself as a leading figure within the political group the Girondins, one of the more moderate revolutionary factions. She was known for her intelligence, astute political analyses and her tenacity, and was a good lobbyist and negotiator. The salon she hosted in her home several times a week was an important meeting place for politicians. However, she was also convinced of her own intellectual and moral superiority and alienated important political leaders like Robespierre and Danton.

Unlike the feminist revolutionaries Olympe de Gouges and Etta Palm, Madame Roland was not an advocate for political rights for women. She accepted that women should play a very modest role in public and political life. Even during her lifetime, many found this position difficult to reconcile with her own active involvement in politics and her important role within the Girondins.

When her husband unexpectedly became Minister of the Interior in 1792, her political influence grew. She had control over the content of ministerial letters, memorandums and speeches, was involved in decisions about political appointments, and was in charge of a bureau set up to influence public opinion in France. She was both admired and reviled, and particularly hated by the sans-culottes of Paris. The publicists Marat and Hébert conducted a smear campaign against Madame Roland as part of the power struggle between the Girondins and the more radical Jacobins and Montagnards. In June 1793, she was the first Girondin to be arrested during the Terror and was guillotined a few months later.

Madame Roland wrote her memoirs while she was imprisoned in the months before her execution. They are – like her letters – a valuable source of information about the first years of the French Revolution.

== Early years ==

=== Childhood ===

Marie-Jeanne Phlipon, known as Manon, was the daughter of Pierre Gatien Phlipon, an engraver, and Marguerite Bimont, daughter of a haberdasher. Her father had a successful business and the family lived in a comfortable environment on the Quai de l&#x27;Horloge in Paris. She was the couple&#x27;s only surviving child; six siblings died when they were young. The first two years of her life she lived with a wet nurse in Arpajon, a small town south-east of Paris.

Manon taught herself to read as a five-year-old and during the catechism lessons, the local priests noticed she was very intelligent. Therefore, and because she was an only child, she received more education than was customary for a girl from her social background at that time; however, it still fell short of the level of schooling a boy would have received. Teachers came to the family home for subjects such as calligraphy, history, geography and music. Her father taught her drawing and art history, an uncle who was a priest gave her some Latin lessons and her grandmother, who had been a governess, took care of spelling and grammar. In addition, she learned from her mother how to run a household.

As a child, she was very religious. At her own request, she lived in a convent for a year to prepare herself for her first communion when she was eleven. Only a few years later she would begin to question the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. Although she eventually turned away from the church, she continued to believe all her life in the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the moral obligation to do good. Her ideas are very close to deism.

Her father&#x27;s workshop was attached to the family home and his adolescent apprentices were part of the household. As a child she was sexually harassed by one of the apprentices who tried to make her fondle him, which she found very frightening. She told her mother about the incident and from that point, the interaction between Manon and the apprentices was more closely watched. 

=== Studying and writing ===
After returning home from the convent, she received little additional formal education but continued to read and study; she was largely an autodidact. She read books on all subjects: history, mathematics, agriculture and law. She developed a passion for the classics; like many of her contemporaries, she was inspired by the biographies of famous Greeks and Romans in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Vitae Parallelae (Parallel Lives)&quot;.

Manon Phlipon&#x27;s ideas on social relations in France were shaped, among other things, by a visit to acquaintances of her grandmother at the court of Versailles. She was not impressed by the self-serving behavior of the aristocrats she met. She found it remarkable that people were given privileges because of their family of birth rather than on merit. She immersed herself in philosophy, particularly in the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau; his democratic ideas strongly influenced her thinking about politics and social justice. Rousseau was also very important to her in other areas. She later said that his books had shown her how to lead a happy and fulfilled life. Throughout her life she would regularly reread Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Julie, ou La Nouvelle Héloïse&quot;, and use it as a source of inspiration. 

She was dissatisfied with the opportunities available to her as a woman and wrote to friends that she would have preferred to have lived in Roman times. For a while, she seriously considered taking over her father&#x27;s business. She corresponded with a number of erudite older men — mainly clients of her father — who acted as intellectual mentors. She started writing philosophical essays herself which she circulated in manuscript among her friends under the title &quot;Oeuvre des loisirs&quot; (&quot;work for relaxation&quot;). In 1777 she took part in an essay competition on the theme &quot;How the education of women can help make men better&quot;. Her essay did not receive a prize.

== Before the revolution ==

=== Marriage ===
In the social milieu of the Phlipons, marriages were usually arranged; it was unusual for a young woman like Manon Phlipon, the only child of fairly prosperous parents, not to be married by the age of twenty. She received at least ten proposals of marriage, but rejected all of them. She had a brief romance with the writer Pahin de la Blancherie, which for her ended in a painful disappointment. A friend of her father, a widower of 56 with whom she corresponded about philosophical issues, asked her to come and live with him on his estate so that they could study philosophy together. She hinted to him that she might consider a platonic marriage, but nothing of the sort came about.
In 1776, Manon Phlipon met Jean-Marie Roland de la Platière, who was twenty years her senior. He was Inspector de Manufactures in Picardy and as such charged with quality control of the products of local manufacturers and craftsmen. He was an expert in the field of production, trade and economic policy, especially of the textile industry. He was intelligent, well-read and well-traveled, but he was also known as a difficult human being: reluctant to take into consideration any opinions but his own and easily irritated. Because of this, he often did not succeed in implementing the economic reforms he favoured, and his career was not as successful as he believed he deserved.

The Roland family had once belonged to the lower nobility, but by the end of the 18th century no longer held a title. There was a clear difference in social status compared to Manon Phlipon&#x27;s family of artisans and shopkeepers. This was her reason for refusing Roland&#x27;s first marriage proposal in 1778. A year later she did accept. The wedding plans were initially kept secret because Roland expected objections from his family. By the standards of that time, this was a &quot;mésalliance&quot;: a marriage considered inappropriate due to the large difference in social status between the spouses.

They were married in February 1780 and initially lived in Paris, where Roland worked at the Ministry of the Interior. From the very first, Madame Roland helped her husband in his work, acting more or less as his secretary. In her spare time she attended lectures on natural history in the Jardin des Plantes, the botanical garden of Paris. Here she met Louis-Augustin Bosc d&#x27;Antic, a natural historian who remained a close friend until her death. Her friendship with François Xavier Lanthenas, later a parliamentarian, also dates from this time.

=== Amiens and Lyon ===
After a year in Paris the couple moved to Amiens. Their only child Eudora was born there in 1781. Unusual for that time — but entirely in line with Rousseau&#x27;s theories — Madame Roland breastfed her daughter herself instead of hiring a wet nurse. She wrote a particularly detailed and candid report of the birth and the problems with breastfeeding, and is one of the first women of this time to write openly about such matters. The report was published after her death.

The couple lived a very quiet life in Amiens and had few social contacts. In Paris, Madame Roland had already supported her husband in his work and their cooperation now developed further. At first she was mainly involved in copying texts and assisting his research; her role was clearly subordinate. In her memoirs she looks back on this situation with some resentment, but her letters from that period do not show that she objected at the time. Her involvement gradually increased; she began to edit and modify text, and eventually wrote major sections herself. Her husband apparently initially did not realize that some texts were hers and not his own. Within a few years, she developed into the better writer, which was also acknowledged by Jean-Marie Roland. In the end he fully accepted her as his intellectual equal and there was an equal partnership.

In 1784, Madame Roland visited Paris for a few weeks to acquire a peerage for her husband. The financial privileges associated with a title would allow him to give up his job as an inspector and focus entirely on writing and research. She discovered that she had a talent for lobbying and negotiating. The peerage did not materialise: in the course of his professional life her husband had too often antagonised his superiors. She did manage to obtain an appointment for him in Lyon that was less demanding than his post in Amiens and better paid. Before the move to Lyon, the couple visited England, where Madame Roland attended a debate in the House of Commons between the legendary political opponents William Pitt the Younger and Charles James Fox.

Although Lyon was Roland&#x27;s official place of work the family usually lived in Villefranche-sur-Saône, about thirty kilometers north of Lyon. Madame Roland focused on the education of her daughter Eudora, who to her great disappointment turned out to be less interested in books and acquiring knowledge than she herself had been at that age. In the following years, she would occasionally in letters to friends (and in her memoirs) continue to call her daughter &quot;slow&quot; and lament that her child had such bad taste. Together with her husband she worked on the &quot;Encyclopédie méthodique — Dictionnaire des Arts et Métiers&quot;, a sequel to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert, which focussed on trade and industry. In 1787 the couple made a trip to Switzerland, where, at the request of Madame Roland, they also visited sites that had played a role in the life of Rousseau.

== The Revolution ==
=== From a distance: 1789–1791 ===
Throughout France, and especially in Paris, protests against the social, economic and political conditions were mounting. The Rolands were in many ways representative of the rising revolutionary elite. They had obtained their social position through work and not through birth, and resented the court in Versailles with its corruption and privileges. They deliberately chose a fairly sober, puritan lifestyle. They favoured a liberal economy and the abolition of old regulations, and advocated relief for the poor. When the French States General were convened in 1789, Madame Roland and her husband were involved in drawing up the local &quot;Cahier de Doléances&quot;, the document in which the citizens of Lyon could express their grievances about the political and economic system. Politics had played no major role in Madame Roland&#x27;s correspondence before 1789, but in the course of that year she became more and more fascinated by political developments.

After the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, her thinking radicalised quickly and there was a complete change in the tone and content of her letters. She was no longer interested in societal reform, but advocated revolution. Institutions from the old regime were no longer acceptable to her; now that the people had taken over sovereignty, a completely new form of government had to be developed. Unlike many other revolutionaries, she was quick to argue for the establishment of a republic. In her political thinking, Madame Roland was irreconcilably radical at this point in time. She was not inclined to compromise on anything; to achieve her revolutionary ideals she found the use of force, and even civil war, acceptable.

During the first eighteen months of the French Revolution the Rolands were based in Lyon, although they still lived in Villefranche part of the time. Madame Roland soon became convinced that a counter-revolution was being plotted. She tried to mobilize her friends through her letters, not hesitating to spread unfounded rumours about events and about people she did not agree with. Meanwhile, it had become common knowledge in Lyon that the Rolands sympathized with the revolutionaries and had supported the establishment of radical political clubs. They were hated by representatives of the old elite because of this. She was happy when, on February 7, 1790, an uprising broke out in Lyon that led to the ousting of the city council and an increase of the number of men eligible to vote.

Madame Roland did not publicly take part in political discussions, but still managed to gain political influence during this period. She corresponded with a network of publicists and politicians, including the Parisian journalist Jacques Pierre Brissot, the future leader of the Girondins, and the lawyer Jean-Henri Bancal d&#x27;Issarts. In her letters she described and analyzed the developments in Lyon. At least on five occasions Brissot published excerpts from her letters as articles in his newspaper &quot;Le Patriote Francaise&quot;, so that her opinions were discussed outside Lyon. Luc-Antoine de Champagneux did the same in his newspaper &quot;Le courier de Lyon&quot;. She was one of the few female correspondents in the revolutionary press. Because her contributions were not published under her own name, but anonymously or as &quot;a woman from the south&quot;, it is impossible to determine with certainty how many articles written by Madame Roland appeared in the press.

=== Activist and &quot;salonnière&quot; ===
In 1790 Jean-Marie Roland was elected in the city council of Lyon where he advocated a moderate revolutionary administration. The Rolands now settled in Lyon but in order to get money for revolutionary reforms they left for Paris in 1791, for what should have been a short stay.

Madame Roland soon became a well-known figure in political circles in Paris, especially thanks to Brissot, who introduced her everywhere. As always, she worked alongside her husband, although the routine copying and editing work was now done by an assistant, Sophie Grandchamp. Madame Roland wrote most of her husband&#x27;s official letters and regretted that she could not go to the new National Assembly herself to argue the case of Lyon: women were admitted only to the public gallery. When she observed the debates from the gallery, it annoyed her that the conservatives were so much better and more eloquent in the debates than the revolutionaries, whom she considered ideologically superior. Outside the assembly she was active as a lobbyist. With Roland, she was a regular visitor at the Jacobin club (here too women were only allowed access to the public gallery).

From April 1791 she hosted a salon in her home several times a week, attended by republicans from bourgeois circles. Among the visitors were Maximilien de Robespierre and the American revolutionary Thomas Paine. According to Madame Roland: &quot;He spoke little, sniggered a great deal, uttered a few touches of sarcasm and never gave an opinion.&quot; She finally broke with him.

During these events, Madame Roland always sat at a table by the window, reading, writing letters or doing needlework. She never involved herself in the conversations going on around her but listened carefully. Her considerable political influence was not exerted by participating in public debate (which she found unseemly for a woman), but through letters and personal conversations. She was known for her sharp political analyses and her ideological tenacity, and was widely recognized as one of the most important people in the group around Brissot. She was always asked for advice on political strategy and she contributed to the content of letters, parliamentary bills and speeches. She was described by contemporaries as a charming woman and a brilliant conversationalist.

Madame Roland&#x27;s salon is one of the main reasons why she is remembered but it may not have been a salon in the usual sense of the term. The gatherings she hosted were strictly political and not social in character; hardly any food or drink was served. They took place in the few hours between the end of the debates in the assembly and the beginning of the meetings in the Jacobin Club. There were also — apart from Madame Roland herself — no women present. This distinguished them from the events hosted by Louise de Kéralio, Sophie de Condorcet and Madame de Staël; although also attended by revolutionaries their gatherings were more like the aristocratic salons of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, an impression that Madame Roland wanted to avoid at any cost.

=== Political ideas ===

The name of Madame Roland is inextricably linked to the Girondins. Both she and her husband were considered to be part of the leadership of this political faction, also called the Brissotins after their leader Jacques Pierre Brissot. Originally, the Girondins — and also the Rolands — were part of the wider Jacobin movement. As the revolution progressed, they began to distance themselves from the Jacobins, who became dominated by radical Parisian leaders like Georges Danton and Jean-Paul Marat. The Girondins opposed the influence Paris had on national politics in preference to federalism; many of the Girondin politicians came from outside the capital. They belonged to the bourgeoisie and positioned themselves as the guardians of the rule of law against the lawlessness of the masses. In this aspect too they differed fundamentally from the Jacobins, who saw themselves as the representatives of the sans-culottes, the workers, and shopkeepers.

Madame Roland’s ideas on women and their rights closely followed the ideals articulated by Jean Jacques Rousseau, and differed from the more expansive early feminist arguments for equal political rights of people such as Olympe de Gouges. In 1783 her ideas of on women’s roles remained relatively conventional, but soon began to shift. She believed like many other members of Girondin club in the existence of &quot;natural&quot; divisions between the sexes. However, she also developed her thinking along Rousseauian lines to emphasize the importance of women as the moral center of the home, thus influencing men and children, extending the home and the moral center of the nation. Rousseau’s glorification of women’s private virtues as the foundation for a new social order influenced many, despite his emphasis on circumscribed domestic and public gender roles. She saw women’s sensitivity – their sensibility – to be their greatest form of influence and power. Thus she felt that it was supremely important that women not only define the domestic but through it form a critical intellectual and moral influence upon men.

Madame Roland found in Rousseau’s model of femininity a path for attaining domestic happiness. Yet she also felt its constraints, stating that she was annoyed with being born a woman in her century, not least because she did not feel suited to the gender norms of the day, musing she would have fared better as a woman in the Roman or Spartan Empires.

== In power: the Ministry of the Interior ==

=== Revolution gathering speed ===

In the months immediately after her arrival in Paris, Madame Roland was not satisfied with the progress of social and political change in France, which she felt to be not fast and far-reaching enough. When King Louis XVI tried to flee the country with his family in June 1791, the revolution gained momentum. Madame Roland herself took to the streets to lobby for the introduction of a republic; she also became a member of a political club under her own name for the first time, despite her conviction that women should not have a role in public life. She felt that at that point in time there was so much at stake that everyone — man or woman — had to fully exert themselves to bring about change. In July of that year, a demonstration on the Champs de Mars led to a massacre: the National Guard opened fire on demonstrators, killing possibly as many as 50 people. Many prominent revolutionaries feared for their lives and fled; the Rolands provided a temporary hiding place for Louise de Kéralio and her husband François Robert.

Soon divisions began to occur within the revolutionaries in the legislative assembly, particularly as to whether France should start a war against Prussia and Austria. Brissot and most of the Girondins were in favour (they feared military support for the monarchy from Prussia and Austria), while Robespierre first wanted to put internal affairs in order. The political situation was so divided that it was next to impossible to form a stable government: there were no ministerial candidates that were acceptable to all parties (including the king and the court). The Girodins were given the opportunity to put their ideas into practice: King Louis XVI asked them to appoint three ministers. In March 1792 Roland was appointed Minister of the Interior. This appointment came so unexpectedly that the Rolands at first thought Brissot was joking. There is no indication that they were actively seeking a government post for Roland. The couple moved into the Hôtel Pontchartran, the official residence of the minister, but kept on their small apartment in the city — just in case.

=== First term of office ===
The office of Minister of the Interior was difficult and the work load was extremely heavy. The ministry was responsible for elections, education, agriculture, industry, commerce, roads, public order, poor relief and the working of government. Madame Roland remained the driving force behind her husband&#x27;s work. She commented on all documents, wrote letters and memorandums, and had a major say in appointments, for example that of Joseph Servan de Gerbey as minister of war. She was, as always, very firm in her views and convinced of her own infallibility.

In April 1792, the war so fervently desired by the Girondins broke out. Madame Roland wrote a reproachful letter to Robespierre because he still opposed the idea. This led to the end of the friendly relations between Robespierre and the Rolands; eventually he would become a sworn enemy of the Girondins and of Madame Roland.

Madame Roland was able to convince her husband and the other ministers that the king was plotting to restore the &quot;ancien régime&quot;. It was her idea to establish an army camp near Paris with 20,000 soldiers from all over France; these should intervene in the event of a possible counter-revolution in the capital. When Louis XVI hesitated to sign this into law, Roland sent him a disrespectful protest letter and published it before the king could respond. Madame Roland is rather vague in her memoirs as to whether she was merely involved in editing the letter, or whether she wrote the whole text. The latter is considered most likely by her biographers. In any case, it was her idea to publish the letter to get more support in the assembly and in the population.

On June 10, 1792, Louis XVI sacked Jean-Marie Roland and the two other Girondin ministers. After this, radical Jacobins and Montagnards took the political initiative, which eventually led to the end of the monarchy on 10 August. Roland was then reappointed as minister.

=== Second term of office ===
The king&#x27;s fall heralded the start of the Terror, a period in which radical groups with great bloodshed got rid of their opponents. In radical circles the position of the Rolands was controversial. The Jacobins, the Montagnards and the Paris Commune viewed them with suspicion: that Roland had served as minister under Louis XVI was seen as collaborating with the &quot;ancien régime&quot;. His dismissal by the king had only led to a temporary restoration of their reputation.

For her part, Madame Roland had no sympathy for &quot;hooligans&quot; like the Jacobins and the Montagnards. Although in letters written during the early days of the revolution she had found the use of violence acceptable, she had a great aversion to brutal and uncivilized behavior. She also resented the uncouth Jacobin foreman Georges Danton, and did not respond to his overtures to cooperate with her. Some historians argue that her refusal to enter into an alliance with Danton ultimately contributed to the fall of the Girondins.

When on 6 and 7 September, hundreds of prisoners were massacred in Parisian prisons because they were suspected of anti-revolutionary sympathies, Madame Roland wrote to a friend that she was beginning to feel ashamed of the revolution. Determining who was responsible for this slaughter became another point of contention between the various factions. Madame Roland — and most of the other Girondins — pointed to Marat, Danton and Robespierre as the instigators of the violence. Political opponents of the Rolands pointed out that &quot;their&quot; Ministry of the Interior was responsible for the prisons and had taken very little action to prevent or stop the violence.

During Roland&#x27;s second term of office, Madame Roland again occupied an important position. It was common knowledge that she wrote most of her husband&#x27;s political texts and that he fully relied on her judgment and ideas; both Danton and Marat publicly mocked him for it. She had her own office in the ministry and directed the work of the &quot;Bureau d&#x27;esprit public&quot; (the &quot;public opinion office&quot;), which aimed to spread the revolutionary ideals among the population. Opponents of the Rolands accused them of using the Office to issue state propaganda in support of the Girondin cause. Although there is no evidence that the Rolands were appropriating public money, it is certain that they were involved in attempts to blacken their political opponents. At least one of the secret agents run by the ministry reported directly to Madame Roland.

The private life of Madame Roland was turbulent during this period. A passionate but in her own words platonic romance had developed between her and the Girondin deputy François Buzot, whom she had first met as a visitor to her salon. This affected her relationship with her husband, who found the idea that his wife was in love with another man hard to bear. The romance with Buzot was possibly also one of the factors contributing to the break with a political ally; her old friend Lanthenas, now a parliamentarian, had for years been in love with her himself, and now distanced himself from the circle around Madame Roland — and from the Girondins.

== Downfall ==

=== Fall of the Girondins ===
Radical newspapers and pamphlets began to spread more and more rumors about anti-revolutionary conspiracies that supposedly were forged at the Rolands&#x27; home. The rather sober dinners that Madame Roland gave twice a week (successors of the &quot;salon&quot; she hosted before Jean-Marie Roland became minister) were depicted as decadent events where politicians were seduced to join the &quot;Roland clique&quot;. Jean-Paul Marat, Jacques-René Hébert and Camille Desmoulins depicted Madame Roland as a manipulative courtesan who deceived the virtuous Roland; in their articles and pamphlets they compared her to Madame du Barry and Marie Antoinette. Although Danton and Robespierre also attacked her in their writings, they presented her as a dangerous political opponent and not as a wicked female.

In December 1792, Madame Roland had to appear before the National Convention (the new Legislative Assembly) on charges of corresponding with aristocrats who had fled to England. She defended herself so well that the deputies applauded — the public gallery remained silent. Her reputation among the people of Paris was poor and there were fears of an assassination attempt; for her own safety she no longer went out into the streets. She slept with a loaded gun within reach; in case of an attack she wanted to be able to end her life, so as not to fall into the hands of the sans-culottes alive.

Political relations were strained further because of the trial of the king and disagreements about the punishment that should be imposed on him. Most Girondin deputies voted against the death penalty, or at least against an immediate execution of the king. Madame Roland&#x27;s letters indicate that she too was against the death sentence. After the execution of Louis XVI on January 21, 1793, Jean-Marie Roland resigned as minister. The reasons are not entirely clear — possibly he resigned in protest against the execution, but possibly also because the work load, the ongoing personal and political attacks by the radicals, and the marital problems had become too much for him. Almost immediately, his papers were confiscated and an investigation was started into his actions as minister. The Rolands were also forbidden to leave Paris.

In April of that year, Robespierre openly accused the Girondins of betraying the Revolution. A few weeks later, on May 31, a &quot;revolutionary committee&quot; (possibly set up by the Paris Commune) made an attempt to arrest Roland. He managed to escape. After hiding with the Rolands&#x27; friend the naturalist Bosc d&#x27;Antic in a former priory in the forest of Montmorency, he fled to Amiens and from there to Rouen. Madame Roland refused to flee or go into hiding; she even went to the Convention to personally protest against the attempted arrest of her husband. In her memoirs she does not fully explain why she acted the way she did. Possibly she was convinced that there was no legal basis to arrest her, but in the early morning of June 1, 1793 she was arrested at her home and transferred to the prison in the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. 
The radical anti-feminist newspaper &quot;Le Père Duchesne&quot; falsely claimed she had confessed to counter-revolutionary activities. In her writings she describes the caricaturing of her female body typical of &quot;Père Duchesne&quot; style of writing: &quot;I was not only transformed into a counter-revolutionary, but into a toothless old hag, and they finished by making me cry about my sins while expecting me to expiate them on the guillotine.&quot;

She was the first prominent Girondin to be incarcerated. A wave of arrests followed. A number of Girondin politicians, including Buzot, managed to escape from Paris.

=== Imprisonment ===
In prison, Madame Roland was allowed to receive visitors. Her assistant Sophie Grandchamp came every other day; Bosc d&#x27;Antic brought her flowers from the botanical garden on his regular visits. They smuggled out her letters to Buzot and presumably also to her husband (any letters to Roland have been lost). She studied English and even had a piano in her cell for a while.

On 24 June she was released unexpectedly because the legal basis for her arrest had been flawed, but was rearrested on a new indictment the very moment she wanted to enter her home. She spent the rest of her imprisonment in the harsher prison of Sainte Pelagie. She was very concerned about the fate of Buzot, more than about Jean-Marie Roland. She was hurt and angry that in his memoirs her husband planned to hold Buzot responsible for the crisis in their marriage. With some difficulty she managed to convince him to destroy the manuscript. She was convinced that she would eventually be put to death but refused to cooperate with an escape plan organized by Roland which involved exchanging clothes with a visitor; she thought this too risky for the visitor.

Outside of Paris, in the summer of 1793 resistance grew against the events in the capital. A revolt broke out in Lyon, and there were centres of resistance in Brittany and Normandy. In the provinces some Girondins argued in favour of a federal republic or even secession from &quot;Paris&quot;. Madame Roland implored her friends not to put themselves at risk but Buzot, who reportedly always carried a miniature of Madame Roland and a lock of her hair with him, was involved in attempts to organise a revolt in Caen. The fate of the imprisoned Girondins was sealed when Charlotte Corday, a Girondin sympathizer from Caen, assassinated the popular Marat in Paris.

When Madame Roland heard in October that Buzot too was in danger of being arrested, she tried to end her life by refusing food. Bosc d&#x27;Antic and Sophie Grandchamp were able to convince her that it would be better to stand trial, because that way she would be able to answer her accusers and save her reputation.

=== Trial and execution ===

On October 31, 1793, twenty-one Girondin politicians were executed after a short trial; most of them were known to Madame Roland and the group included her good friend Brissot. The next day she was transferred to the Conciergerie, the prison known as the last stop on the way to the guillotine; immediately upon arrival she was questioned by the prosecutor for two days. She defended herself in her customary self-assured, (according to the newspaper &quot;Le Moniteur Universel&quot;) even haughty manner against the accusations, but also argued in her defence that she was &quot;only a wife&quot; and therefore could not be held responsible for the political actions of her husband. According to eyewitnesses like her fellow prisoner and political adversary Jacques Claude Beugnot she remained calm and courageous during her stay in the Conciergerie. On 8 November she appeared before the Revolutionary Tribunal. She had no doubt that she would be sentenced to death and dressed that day in the &quot;toilette de mort&quot; she had selected some time before: a simple dress of white-yellow muslin with a black belt. After a short trial she was found guilty of conspiracy against the revolution and the death sentence was pronounced; the judge did not allow her to read a statement she had prepared.

The sentence was carried out the same day. Sophie Grandchamp and the historian Pierre François Tissot saw her pass on her way to the scaffold and reported that she appeared very calm. There are two versions handed down concerning her last words at the foot of the guillotine: &#x27;&quot;O Liberté, que de crimes on commit en ton nom!&quot; (&quot;Oh freedom, what crimes are committed in your name!&quot;), or &quot;O Liberté, on t&#x27;a jouée&quot; (&quot;Oh freedom, they have made a mockery of you.&quot;). &quot;Le Moniteur Universel&quot; wrote disapprovingly that Madame Roland had gone to her death with &quot;ironic gaiety&quot; and stated that like Marie Antoinette and the feminist Olympe de Gouges, she had been put to death because she had crossed the &quot;boundaries of female virtue&quot;.

When a few days later Jean-Marie Roland heard in his hiding place in Rouen that his wife had been executed, he committed suicide. Her beloved Buzot lived as a fugitive for several months and then also ended his own life. After the death of her parents, her daughter Eudora came under the guardianship of Bosc d&#x27;Antic and later married a son of the journalist Luc-Antoine de Champagneux.

== Legacy ==

=== Memoirs and letters ===
During the five months she was imprisoned, Madame Roland wrote her memoirs entitled &quot;Appel à l&#x27;impartiale postérité&quot; (&quot;Appeal to the impartial posterity&quot;). These consist of three parts:

* &quot;Mémoires historiques&quot; (&quot;Historical Memoirs&quot;), a defence of her political actions in the years 1791 – 1793
* &quot;Mémoires particuliers&quot; (&quot;Personal Memoirs&quot;)&#x27;, in which she describes her childhood and upbringing
* &quot;Mes dernières pensées&quot; (&quot;My Last Thoughts&quot;)
, an epilogue she wrote when she decided in early October 1793 to end her life by a hunger strike.

Particularly in the &quot;Mémoires historiques&quot; she goes to much effort to show that she had been &quot;just the wife&quot; and had always behaved in a way that was considered appropriate for a woman of her time. She is indignant that the Jacobin press compared her to the influential noble women from the &quot;ancien régime&quot;. At the same time, through her description of events she shows — consciously or unconsciously — how large her influence was within the Girondin circle, and how fundamentally important her contribution was to Roland&#x27;s ministry. She provides a fairly reliable and accurate account of events, although she sometimes leaves out things that do not show her in the most favourable light. She was certainly not neutral in her description of people she did not like.

In the &quot;Mémoires particuliers&quot; she reports on her personal life in a way that was unusual for a woman of that time. She speaks of a sexual assault by a pupil of her father, her experiences during her wedding night and her problems with breastfeeding. In this she followed Rousseau who also mentions &#x27;inappropriate&#x27; personal details in his &quot;Confessions&quot;.

She entrusted the manuscript of her memoirs to the journalist Luc-Antoine de Champagneux, whom she knew from Lyon. When he also was in danger of being arrested, the document was burned to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. In the final months of her imprisonment she wrote the memoirs all over again. This second manuscript was smuggled out of prison in small packages, was hidden by Bosc d&#x27;Antic during the Terror and is now in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris.

Madame Roland wanted her words to be published after her death. She regretted that she would not live long enough to write the complete history of the French Revolution. In 1795, two years after her death, the memoirs appeared in print for the first time. At least 12,000 copies were sold. This first edition was edited by Bosc d&#x27;Antic; references to her love for Buzot and her deistic ideas were &quot;cleansed&quot; by him. In 1864, the sections of text removed by Bosc and five letters from Madame Roland to Buzot were rediscovered. Only then did it become generally known who Madame Roland had been in love with during the last months of her life. In 1905 the complete, uncensored text was published for the first time.

Many of her letters to friends, relatives and co-revolutionaries survived and have been published; these too are a rich source of information about historical events and people, and about daily life at the end of the 18th century. There are about a thousand letters dating from the period 1767 to 1793. Her main correspondents were her childhood friend Sophie Cannet, her husband, and Bosc d&#x27;Antic; in addition, she also corresponded frequently with Lanthenas and Bancal d&#x27;Issarts, Girondins whom she considered friends.

=== Historiography ===
In 1837, the Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle published &quot;The French Revolution: a History,&quot; his now famous study of the French Revolution. He paid ample attention to the role of Madame Roland, whom he called the bravest of French women. Alphonse de Lamartine also praised her in his &quot;Histoire des Girondins&quot; (1847).
In the second half of the nineteenth century the first biographies of Madame Roland were published. These followed the admiring example of Carlyle and Lamartine and were based on the censored versions of her memoirs. Until the 20th century, biographers emphasized her intelligence, feminine charm and high morals, and depicted her primarily as a tragic heroine in the struggle for freedom and equality. The American writer Jeanette Eaton wrote a prize-winning biography about Madame Roland for children, titled &quot;A daughter of the Seine&quot; (1929).

=== Women&#x27;s studies ===
Madame Roland&#x27;s memoirs and letters are unique in that they show the French Revolution from the perspective of a very intelligent woman who played an active role in the heart of events. When interest in the role of women in history grew at the end of the twentieth century, there was an upsurge in the number of publications on the life and work of Madame Roland. This helped build a more nuanced and less idealized image of her. There has also been a minor rehabilitation of Jean-Marie Roland, who was traditionally presented as someone intellectually and politically dwarfed by his wife. It is now recognized that although he did not have his wife&#x27;s charisma and sharp political talent, he was an intelligent and conscientious administrator.

In particular, attention focussed on the contrast between Madame Roland&#x27;s views on the limited role women should play in public life, and her own active and directive involvement in politics. Madame Roland never spoke out for women&#x27;s rights. She stated that the time was not yet right for women to openly participate in public debate. It was the role of women to inspire and support the men behind the scenes. Only when all French men were politically and socially free, could women also claim their place in public life. It is possible that here too she followed her idol Rousseau, who felt that women should be mainly supportive and subservient.

At the same time she states in her memoirs that the restrictions imposed by society on women were abhorrent to her, and looking back she found it difficult to stomach that for a time she had played only a subordinate role in the collaboration with her husband. However, she chose to conform to the social norms of her time. Her views are closer to those held by Louise de Kéralio than the revolutionary feminists Etta Palm and Olympe de Gouges.

<doc id="196723" wikidata="Q2342422" url="?curid=196723" title="USS Boxer (CV-21)">
<text>USS &quot;Boxer&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-21, LPH-4) was one of 24 s of the United States Navy, and the fifth ship to be named for . She was launched on 14 December 1944 and christened by the daughter of a US Senator from Louisiana.

Commissioned too late to see any combat in World War II, &quot;Boxer&quot; spent much of her career in the Pacific Ocean, seeing 10 tours in the western Pacific. Her initial duties involved mostly training and exercises, including launching the first carrier-based jet aircraft, but demobilization prevented much activity in the late 1940s. At the outbreak of the Korean War, she was used as an aircraft transport before arriving off Korean waters as the third U.S. carrier to join the force. She supported the Inchon landings and subsequent invasion of North Korea, and was among the ships that provided support during the Chinese counteroffensive against an under-prepared and spread out United Nations (UN) force. She saw three subsequent combat tours in Korea, conducting close air support and strategic bombing in support of UN ground troops fighting along the 38th parallel, as the battles lines had largely solidified by this time. She was awarded eight battle stars for her service in Korea.

After the Korean War, &quot;Boxer&quot; saw a variety of duties, including as an anti-submarine warfare carrier and an amphibious assault platform. She participated in a number of training exercises including Operation Hardtack and Operation Steel Pike, as well as several contingencies including Operation Powerpack and the Cuban Missile Crisis. In her later years, she served as a pickup ship for spacecraft during the Apollo program, and as an aircraft transport to troops during the Vietnam War.

Although she was extensively modified internally as part of her conversion to a Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH), external modifications were minor, so throughout her career &quot;Boxer&quot; retained the classic appearance of a World War II &quot;Essex&quot;-class ship. She was decommissioned on 1 December 1969 after 25 years of service and sold for scrap.

&quot;Boxer&quot; was one of 24 &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships to be completed, among the largest and most numerous capital ships produced for World War II. She was ordered in 1943.

The ship was one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; designs of the class, which had begun production after March 1943. This &quot;long hull&quot; variant involved lengthening the bow above the waterline into a &quot;clipper&quot; form. The increased rake and flare provided deck space for two quadruple 40 mm mounts; these units also had the flight deck slightly shortened forward to provide better arcs of fire. Of the &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships laid down after 1942, only followed the original &quot;short bow&quot; design. The later ships have been variously referred to as the &quot;long-bow units&quot;, the &quot;long-hull group&quot;, or the &quot;&quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class&quot;. However, the U.S. Navy never maintained any institutional distinction between the long-hull and short-hull members of the &quot;Essex&quot; class, and postwar refits and upgrades were applied to both groups equally.

Like other &quot;long-hull&quot; &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers, &quot;Boxer&quot; had a displacement of . She had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . The ship was powered by eight 600 psi Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, and Westinghouse geared steam turbines that developed that turned four propellers. Like other &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers, she had a maximum speed of . The ship had a total crew complement of 3,448. Like other &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships, she could be armed with 12 5-inch (127 mm)/38 caliber guns arrayed in four pairs and four single emplacements, as well as eight quadruple Bofors 40 mm guns and 46 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. However, unlike her sisters, &quot;Boxer&quot; was armed instead with 72 40 mm guns and 35 20 mm cannons.

Her keel was laid on 13 September 1943 by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company at its facility in Newport News, Virginia. She was the fifth ship of the US Navy to be named &quot;Boxer&quot;, after , which had been captured by the U.S. during the War of 1812. The last ship to bear the name had been a training ship in 1905. The new carrier was launched on 14 December 1944 and she was christened by Ruth D. Overton, the daughter of U.S. Senator John H. Overton. The ship&#x27;s cost is estimated at $68,000,000 to $78,000,000.

==Service history==

&quot;Boxer&quot; was commissioned on 16 April 1945 under the command of Captain D. F. Smith. She subsequently began sea trials and a shakedown cruise. Before these were complete, the Empire of Japan surrendered on V-J Day, marking the end of World War II before &quot;Boxer&quot; could participate. She joined the Pacific Fleet at San Diego in August 1945 and the next month she steamed for Guam, becoming the flagship of Task Force 77, a position she held until 23 August 1946. During this tour, she visited Japan, Okinawa, the Philippines, and China.

She returned to San Francisco on 10 September 1946, embarked Carrier Air Group 19 flying the Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter. With this complement, &quot;Boxer&quot; began a series of peacetime patrols and training missions off the coast of California during a relatively uneventful period during 1947. In spite of manning difficulties brought on by the demobilization of the US military after World War II, &quot;Boxer&quot; remained active in Pacific readiness drills around the West Coast and Hawaii. In 1948, she conducted a number of short cruises with US Navy Reserve personnel. On 10 March 1948, a North American FJ-1 Fury launched from &quot;Boxer&quot;, the first such launch of an all-jet aircraft from an American carrier, which allowed subsequent tests of jet aircraft carrier doctrine. For the remainder of 1948 and 1949, she participated in numerous battle drills and acted as a training carrier for jet aircraft pilots.

She was dispatched to the Far East on another tour on 11 January 1950. She joined the 7th Fleet in the region, making a goodwill visit to South Korea and entertaining South Korean president Syngman Rhee and his wife Franziska Donner. and at the end of the tour returned to San Diego on 25 June 1950, the same day as the outbreak of the Korean War. At the time, she was overdue for a maintenance overhaul, but she did not have time to complete it before being dispatched again.

===Korean War===
With the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. forces in the Far East had an urgent need for supplies and aircraft. The only aircraft carriers near Korea were and . &quot;Boxer&quot; was ordered into service to ferry aircraft from California to the fighting on the Korean Peninsula. She made a record-breaking crossing of the Pacific Ocean, leaving Alameda, California, on 14 July 1950 and arriving at Yokosuka, Japan, on 23 July, a trip of 8 days and 7 hours. She carried 145 North American P-51 Mustangs and six Stinson L-5 Sentinels of the United States Air Force destined for the Far East Air Force as well as 19 Navy aircraft, 1,012 Air Force support personnel, and of supplies for the United Nations troops fighting the North Korean invasion of South Korea, including crucially needed spare parts and ordnance. Much of this equipment had been taken from Air National Guard units in the United States because of a general shortage of materiel. She began her return trip from Yokosuka on 27 July and arrived back in California on 4 August, for a trip of 7 days, 10 hours and 36 minutes, again breaking the record for a trans-Pacific cruise. She carried no jet aircraft, though, because they were deemed too fuel inefficient for the initial defense mission in Korea. By the time &quot;Boxer&quot; arrived in Korea, the UN forces had established superiority in the air and sea.
After rapid repairs in California, &quot;Boxer&quot; embarked Carrier Air Group 2, flying the Vought F4U Corsair propeller driven fighter-bomber, and departed again for Korea on 24 August, this time in a combat role. She had 110 aircraft aboard, intended to complement the hundreds of aircraft already operating in Korea. En route to the peninsula, the carrier narrowly avoided Typhoon Kezia which slowed her trip. She was the fourth aircraft carrier to arrive in Korea to participate in the war, after &quot;Triumph&quot; and &quot;Valley Forge&quot; had arrived in June and followed in early August. She arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, but instead she was ordered to join a flotilla of 230 US ships which would participate in Operation Chromite, the UN counterattack at Inchon. On 15 September, she supported the landings by sending her aircraft in a close air support role, blocking North Korean reinforcements and communication to prevent them from countering the attack. However, early in the operation, her propulsion system was damaged when a reduction gear in the ship&#x27;s engine broke, a casualty of her overdue maintenance. The ship&#x27;s engineers worked around the problem to keep the carrier in operation, but she was limited to 26 knots.

She continued this role as the UN troops recaptured Seoul days later. &quot;Boxer&quot; continued this support as UN troops advanced north and into North Korea, but departed for the United States on 11 November for refit and overhaul. US military commanders believed the war in Korea was over, and had ordered a number of other carriers out of the area and were subsequently under-prepared at the beginning of the Chosin Reservoir Campaign when the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army entered the war against the UN. Battlefield commanders requested &quot;Boxer&quot; return to Korea as soon as possible, but she did not immediately return as commanders feared it might reduce the Navy&#x27;s ability to respond if another conflict or emergency broke out elsewhere.
&quot;Boxer&quot;″s propulsion problems required extensive repair, so she returned to San Diego to conduct them. Upon arrival, she offloaded Air Group 2, which then embarked for Korea again aboard &quot;Valley Forge&quot;. After a repair and refit in California, &quot;Boxer&quot; was prepared for a second tour in Korea. She embarked Carrier Air Group 101. The group was composed of Navy Reserve squadrons from Dallas, Texas, Glenview, Illinois, Memphis, Tennessee and Olathe, Kansas, and most of its pilots were reservists who had been called to active duty. She rejoined Task Force 77, and began operations in Korea on 29 March 1951, and her squadrons were the first Naval Reserve pilots to launch strikes in Korea. Most of these missions were airstrikes against Chinese ground forces along the 38th parallel, and this duty lasted until 24 October 1951. During this time, the carrier operated around &quot;Point Oboe&quot;, an area off the coast of Wonsan. They would withdraw another east when they needed replenishment or refueling. A large destroyer screen protected the carriers, though MiG-15 attacks against them did not occur.

After another period of rest and refits, &quot;Boxer&quot; departed California 8 February 1952 for her third tour in Korea, with Carrier Air Group 2 embarked, consisting of F9F in VF-24, F4U in VF 63 and VF-64, and AD in VF-65. Rejoining Task Force 77, her missions during this tour consisted primarily of strategic bombing against targets in North Korea, as the front lines in the war had largely solidified along the 38th Parallel. On 23 and 24 June, her planes conducted strikes against the Sui-ho hydro-electric complex in conjunction with , and &quot;Philippine Sea&quot;.
On 5 August 1952, a fire broke out on the hangar deck of &quot;Boxer&quot; at 05:30 when a fuel tank of an aircraft caught fire while the ship was conducting combat operations in the Sea of Japan. The fire raged on the carrier&#x27;s hangar deck for 4–5 hours before being extinguished. The final total of casualties was 8 dead, 1 missing, 1 critically injured, 1 seriously burned and some 70 overcome by smoke. Of the 63 who had gone over the side, all were rescued and returned to the ship. Eighteen aircraft, mostly Grumman F9F-2 Panthers, were damaged or destroyed. She steamed for Yokosuka for emergency repairs from 11 to 23 August. She returned to the Korean theatre, and from 28 August to 2 September she tested a new weapons system, with six radio guided Grumman F6F Hellcats loaded with bombs guided to targets, resulting in two hits and one near miss. They are considered to be the first guided missiles to be launched from a carrier in combat. On 1 September her aircraft also took part in a large bombing mission of an oil refinery near Aoji, on the Manchurian border. She returned to San Francisco for more extensive repairs on 25 September. In October 1952, she was re-designated CVA-21, denoting an &quot;attack aircraft carrier.&quot;

Following extensive repairs, she steamed for Korea again on 30 March 1953, and resumed operations a month later with her Corsairs embarked. Her missions around this time were generally strategic bombing missions, however the effectiveness of these final missions were mixed, with some failing to achieve strategic results. She also provided close air support for UN troops for the final weeks of the war before an armistice was reached at Panmunjom in July 1953, ending major combat operations in Korea. During this time, the two sides often conducted costly attacks in order to strengthen their bargaining positions at the negotiating table. &quot;Boxer&quot; remained in Korean waters until November 1953. She received eight battle stars for her service in Korea.

In 1951 she appears in the film &quot;Submarine Command&quot;, with William Bendix and William Holden, then carrying a complement of helicopters.

=== Post-Korea ===
Following the Korean War, &quot;Boxer&quot; returned to the United States. She conducted a tour of the Pacific throughout 1954 which was relatively uneventful. That tour included being dispatched along with the USS Essex to the South China Sea, between Indochina and the Philippines, while the United States considered whether to use carrier aircraft to support French troops during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, a key battle in the First Indochina War. The United States eventually decided to not join the fighting. The tour of the Pacific was followed by a rest in the United States and another tour in the Pacific in late 1955 and early 1956, which was similarly uneventful.

She was converted to an anti-submarine warfare carrier in early 1956, re-designated CVS-21. She completed another tour of the western Pacific in late 1956 and early 1957, which was her tenth and final deployment to the area. In late 1957, the navy began experimenting with the concept of a carrier operating entirely with attack helicopters, and &quot;Boxer&quot; was used to test the concept.

In 1958, &quot;Boxer&quot; was the flagship during Operation Hardtack, a series of nuclear weapons tests in the central Pacific. Later that year, she was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, and became part of a new amphibious assault squadron with four Landing Ship Tank vessels equipped with helicopter platforms. The experimental concept would allow for rapid deployment of US Marine Corps personnel and helicopter squadrons. For the remainder of 1958 elements of this force were organized aboard &quot;Boxer&quot; and she was reclassified LPH-4, denoting a &quot;Landing Platform Helicopter&quot;, on 30 January 1959.

For the next 10 years, &quot;Boxer&quot; operated mainly out of the Caribbean as an amphibious assault carrier. During this duty, she was on station during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1964, she undertook her first tour to the Mediterranean when she took part in Operation Steel Pike, the largest amphibious exercise in history.

With two LSD ships, &quot;Boxer&quot; was dispatched to Hispaniola on 29 August 1964 on a humanitarian mission to aid Haiti and the Dominican Republic whose infrastructure had been damaged by Hurricane Cleo. The ships provided medical aid and helped to evacuate civilians displaced by the storm. On 27 April 1965 &quot;Boxer&quot; returned to the Dominican Republic with Helicopter Squadron 264 and a complement of Marines. They evacuated about 1,000 US nationals from the country in the wake of a revolution in the country. It was a part of Operation Powerpack which would eventually see the US occupation of that country. Later in 1965, she was used as a transport vessel for the Vietnam War. The carrier transported 200 helicopters of the US Army&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division to South Vietnam. She made a second trip to Vietnam in early 1966 when she transported Marine Corps aircraft to South Vietnam. However, she did not participate in combat operations during that war.

On 26 February 1966, &quot;Boxer&quot; recovered AS-201, an unmanned test flight of the Apollo program which had launched from Cape Kennedy, Florida aboard a Saturn 1B rocket. The capsule had landed east of Ascension Island and one of &quot;Boxer&quot;&#x27;s helicopters picked it up. From 16–17 March 1966, &quot;Boxer&quot; was the designated Atlantic prime recovery ship for Gemini 8, although recovered the spacecraft and two crewmen after it encountered problems.

She was decommissioned on 1 December 1969 after 25 years of service, and she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. 
She was sold for scrap on 13 March 1971 by Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service and later scrapped at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

<text>The Best of Bond... James Bond is the title of various compilation albums of music used in the &quot;James Bond&quot; films made by Eon Productions up to that time. The album was originally released in 1992 as The Best of James Bond, as a one-disc compilation and a two-disc 30th Anniversary Limited Edition compilation with songs that had, at that point, never been released to the public. The single disc compilation was later updated five times in 1999, 2002, 2008, 2012, and 2021. The 2008 version was augmented with the addition of a DVD featuring music videos and a documentary. Another two-disc edition, this time containing 50 tracks for the 50th anniversary of the franchise, was released in 2012.

==30th Anniversary Collection==
The 30th Anniversary Collection of &quot;The Best of James Bond&quot; was released in 1992. It featured 19 tracks including 16 title songs for the 16 films that had thus far been released.

# &quot;007&quot; by John Barry Orchestra

A limited 2-disc edition, released in the US only, reshuffles the tracks, sorting chronologically the 16 title songs on disc 1, the three remaining tracks appearing on disc 2. It also includes four tracks that were originally missing from &quot;Goldfinger&quot;″s soundtrack (US release), although these four were included in the remastered soundtrack for &quot;Goldfinger&quot; in 2003 and appeared on the British LP in the 1960s. The &quot;Thunderball Suite&quot;, was likewise not released on the &quot;Thunderball&quot; soundtrack until it was split up and used on the remastered release in 2003, along with extra unreleased music.

Two rare additions were also made to the second disc. The first is the original version of &quot;Goldfinger&quot; sung by Anthony Newley who also wrote the song in collaboration with the film&#x27;s composer, John Barry. Newley&#x27;s jazz version was, however, replaced by Shirley Bassey&#x27;s version in 1964 for the film and for release on the album. Newley&#x27;s version was first released with the 30th Anniversary Collection. The second rare addition is Shirley Bassey&#x27;s version of &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; for &quot;Thunderball&quot;. Bassey had originally recorded the vocals for the track which initially was to be used as the main title theme; however, the song was replaced by Tom Jones&#x27; &quot;Thunderball&quot; after a decision by the producers that the title theme should feature the name of the film. Dionne Warwick was subsequently chosen to rerecord &quot;Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot;, but even her version wasn&#x27;t released on the &quot;Thunderball&quot; soundtrack till the 1990s.

<text>Edwin Arlington Robinson (December 22, 1869 – April 6, 1935) was an American poet and playwright. Robinson won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry on three occasions and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.

==Early life==
Robinson was born in Head Tide, Maine, on December 22, 1869. His parents were Edward and Mary (née Palmer). They had wanted a girl, and did not name him until he was six months old, when they visited a holiday resort—at which point other vacationers decided that he should have a name, and selected the name &quot;Edwin&quot; from a hat containing a random set of boy&#x27;s names. The man who drew the name was from Arlington, Massachusetts, so &quot;Arlington&quot; was used for his middle name. Throughout his life, he hated not only his given name but also his family&#x27;s habit of calling him &quot;Win&quot;. As an adult, he always used the signature &quot;E. A.&quot;

Robinson&#x27;s family moved to Gardiner, Maine, in 1870. He later described his childhood as &quot;stark and unhappy&quot;. Robinson first studied at Mrs. Morrell&#x27;s School in Gardiner and later attended public schools, graduating from Gardiner High School.

Robinson&#x27;s early struggles led many of his poems to have a dark pessimism and his stories to deal with &quot;an American dream gone awry.&quot; His eldest brother, Dean, was a doctor and had become addicted to laudanum while self-medicating for neuralgia. The middle brother, Herman, a handsome and charismatic man, married the woman Edwin loved, Emma Löehen Shepherd. Emma thought highly of Edwin and encouraged his poetry, but he was deemed too young to be in realistic competition for her hand, which didn&#x27;t keep him from being agitated deeply by witnessing what he considered her being deceived by Herman&#x27;s charm and choosing shallowness over depth. The marriage was a great blow to Edwin&#x27;s pride, and during the wedding ceremony, on February 12, 1890, the despondent poet stayed home and wrote a poem of protest, &quot;Cortège&quot;, the title of which refers to the train that took the newly married couple out of town to their new life in St. Louis, Missouri. Herman suffered multiple business failures, becoming an alcoholic, and ended up estranged from his wife and children. Herman died impoverished in 1909 of tuberculosis at Boston City Hospital. Robinson&#x27;s poem &quot;Richard Cory&quot; was thought by his sister-in-law Emma to refer to her husband.

== Education at Harvard University ==
In 1891, at the age of 21, Robinson entered Harvard University as a special student where he took classes in English, French, and Shakespeare; as well as one on Anglo-Saxon that he later dropped. He did not aim to get all A&#x27;s; as he wrote his friend Harry Smith, &quot;B, and in that vicinity, is a very comfortable and safe place to hang.&quot;

Robinson&#x27;s real desire was to get published in one of the Harvard literary journals. Within the first fortnight of being there, &quot;The Harvard Advocate&quot; published Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Ballade of a Ship.&quot; He was even invited to meet with the editors, but when he returned, he complained to his friend Mowry Saben, &quot;I sat there among them, unable to say a word.&quot;

Robinson&#x27;s father died after his first year at Harvard. He returned to Harvard for a second year, but it was to be his last one as a student there. Though short, Robinson&#x27;s stay in Cambridge included some of his most cherished experiences, and there he made his most lasting friendships. He wrote his friend Harry Smith on June 21, 1893:

I suppose this is the last letter I shall ever write you from Harvard. The thought seems a little queer, but it cannot be otherwise. Sometimes I try to imagine the state my mind would be in had I never come here, but I cannot. I feel that I have got comparatively little from my two years, but still, more than I could get in Gardiner if I lived a century.

By mid-1893, Robinson had returned to Gardiner, where he made plans to start writing seriously. In October he wrote his friend Gledhill:

Writing has been my dream ever since I was old enough to lay a plan for an air castle. Now for the first time I seem to have something like a favorable opportunity and this winter I shall make a beginning.

==Career==

With his father gone, Robinson became the man of the household. He tried farming and developed a close relationship with his sister-in-law Emma Robinson, who after her husband Herman&#x27;s death, moved back to Gardiner with her children. She twice rejected marriage proposals from Robinson, after which he permanently left Gardiner. He moved to New York, where he lived as an impoverished poet while cultivating friendships with other writers, artists, and intellectuals. In 1896, he self-published his first book, &quot;The Torrent and the Night Before&quot;, paying 100 dollars for 500 copies. Robinson meant it as a surprise for his mother. Days before the copies arrived, his mother died of diphtheria. His eldest brother, Dean, died of a drug overdose in 1899.

Robinson&#x27;s second volume, &quot;Children of The Night&quot;, published in 1897, had a somewhat wider circulation. Its readers included President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s son Kermit, who had received a copy from his teacher, who happened to be a friend of Robinson. Kermit then recommended it to his father, who, impressed by the poems and aware of Robinson&#x27;s straits, invited Robinson to join him for dinner at the White House (though Robinson declined due to his lacking &quot;suitable clothes&quot;) and in 1905 offered the writer a sinecure at the New York Customs Office. According to Edmund Morris, author of &quot;Theodore Rex&quot;, a tacit condition of his employment was that, in exchange for his desk and two thousand dollars a year, he should work &quot;with a view to helping American letters&quot;, rather than the receipts of the United States Treasury. Robinson remained in the job until Roosevelt left office. In 1913, Robinson lived on Lighthouse Hill, Staten Island.

Gradually his literary successes began to mount. He won the Pulitzer Prize three times in 1922, 1925 and 1928, and was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1927. He was later described by the poet Michael Schmidt as &quot;more artful than Hardy and more coy than Frost and a brilliant sonneteer&quot;. 

==Tilbury==

Tilbury Town is a fictional American town which is the location for many works by Robinson. The small New England village was modeled after Gardiner, Maine, where Robinson grew up. Tilbury Town is the setting of “Richard Cory”, “Mr. Flood’s Party”, and “Luke Havergall”, all of which are included in the Columbia Anthology of the 500 most anthologized poems in the English language. Most of Robinson’s non-Arthurian characters only appear in one poem; however, four residents of Tilbury Town—Calverly, Clavering, Leffingwell, and Lingard—are mentioned in at least three poems each.

== Personal life ==
Robinson never married. During the last 20 years of his life he became a regular summer resident at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, where several women made him the object of their devoted attention. Robinson and artist Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones visited MacDowell at the same times over a cumulative total of ten years. They had a romantic relationship in which she was in love with him, devoted to him and understood him, and was relaxed in her approach with him; he called her Sparhawk and was courteous towards her. They had a relationship that the poet D. H. Tracy described as &quot;courtly, quiet, and intense&quot;. She described him as a charming, sensitive, and emotionally grounded man with high moral values.

== Death and legacy ==
Robinson died of cancer on April 6, 1935, in the New York Hospital (now the Weill Cornell Medical Center) in New York City; he was buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Gardiner, Maine. When Robinson died, Sparhawk-Jones attended his vigil and later painted several works in his memory. The same month, a memorial ceremony was held at Gardiner High School, Robinson&#x27;s old school. In October of the same year, a monument was erected in Gardiner Common through the efforts of Robinson&#x27;s friend and mentor Laura E. Richards, who raised the money for the monument from across the country; the Boston architect Henry R. Shepley provided the design, Richards wrote the inscription and Robinson’s biographer, Herman Hagedorn, was the keynote speaker.

Robinson&#x27;s childhood home in Gardiner was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971. Robinson&#x27;s grandnephew David S. Nivison, a noted expert on Chinese philosophy and Chinese history, was a trustee of Robinson&#x27;s estate.

<doc id="196727" wikidata="Q321042" url="?curid=196727" title="Jean-Luc Lagardère">
<text>Jean-Luc Lagardère (; 10 February 1928 – 14 March 2003) was a major French businessman, CEO of the Lagardère Group, one of the largest French conglomerates.

== Career ==
Jean-Luc Lagardère was a &quot;Supélec&quot; engineer. He began his career in Dassault Aviation. As CEO of Matra in the 1960s, he became famous with success in Formula One and Le Mans. He later built a large media and defense conglomerate that bears his name. He was a member of the Saint-Simon Foundation think-tank.

In 1981, with his friend Daniel Filipacchi, he purchased Hachette magazines, which included the French &quot;TV Guide&quot; (&quot;Tele 7 Jours&quot;), and the then-struggling &quot;Elle&quot; magazine. &quot;Elle&quot; was then launched in the U.S., followed by 25 foreign editions. Filipacchi and Lagardère then expanded Hachette Filipacchi Magazines in the U.S. with the purchase of Diamandis Communications Inc. (formerly CBS magazines), including &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, &quot;Road and Track&quot;, &quot;Flying&quot;, &quot;Boating&quot;, and many others.

Despite setbacks, such as the costly failure of La Cinq TV channel, he led significant mergers that established EADS, today major global aerospace contractor Airbus. He handed over control of his businesses to his son Arnaud in 2001, under whom the Lagardère Group continued to thrive. Jean-Luc Lagardère&#x27;s contributions were praised by President Jacques Chirac, highlighting his visionary leadership and commitment to European integration.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
Lagardère was a prominent figure in French horse racing. In 1981, he purchased the renowned Haras d&#x27;Ouilly stud in Pont-d&#x27;Ouilly, Calvados that had been owned by François Dupré and raced under their famous colors of gray with a pink cap. At one time, his operation had as many as 220 horses. He won the French owners&#x27; championship in 1998 and between 1995 and 2001 was the leading breeder in France. His most important racing win came with Sagamix who won the 1998 Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe.

Upon its formation in 1995, Jean-Luc Lagardère served as the first president of France-Galop. On his death in 2003, the business was taken over by his son Arnaud who sold Haras d&#x27;Ouilly and its entire bloodstock in 2005 to the Aga Khan IV.

In 2002, the Group One Grand Critérium race for two-year-olds at Longchamp Racecourse was renamed in his honor.

== Personal life ==
He first married Corinne Lagardère. They had one son, Arnaud. After his divorce, he married Betty Lagardère, whose birth name is Elisabeth Pimenta Lucas, a socialite and former Brazilian model who settled in France.

== Death ==
Lagardere died on March 14, 2003, from a rare neurological condition.

== Legacy ==
In honor of his contribution to Airbus, the company has chosen to name the Airbus A380 assembly plant in Toulouse after him. With production ending in 2022, the plant was then converted into the final assembly line for the Airbus A320 family.

<text>Charles Alexandre Dupuy (; 5 November 1851 – 23 July 1923) was a French statesman, three times prime minister.

==Biography==
He was born in Le Puy-en-Velay, Haute-Loire, Auvergne, where his father was a minor official. After a period as a professor of philosophy in the provinces, he was appointed a school inspector, thus obtaining a practical acquaintance with the needs of French education. In 1885 he was elected to the chamber as an Opportunist Republican. After acting as &quot;reporter&quot; of the budget for public instruction, he became minister for the department, in Alexandre Ribot&#x27;s cabinet, in 1892. In April 1893 he formed a ministry himself, taking as his office that of minister of the interior, but resigned at the end of November, and on 5 December was elected president of the chamber. During his first week of office an anarchist, Vaillant, who had managed to gain admission to the chamber, threw a bomb at the president, and Dupuy&#x27;s calm response --&quot;&quot;Messieurs, la séance continue&quot; – gained him much credit.

In May 1894 he again became premier and minister of the interior; and he was at President Carnot&#x27;s side when Carnot was stabbed to death at Lyons in June. He then stood for the presidency, but was defeated, and his cabinet remained in office till January 1895; under this government, Alfred Dreyfus was arrested and condemned (23 December 1894). The progress of the &quot;Dreyfus Affair&quot; cast its shadow over Dupuy, along with other French &quot;ministrables&quot;,&quot; but in November 1898, after Henri Brisson had at last remitted the case to the judgment of the court of cassation, he formed a cabinet of Republican concentration.

During Dupuy&#x27;s time as prime minister, a number of progressive reforms were carried out. A law implemented in June 1894 introduced a form of social insurance through a mutual fund for miners&#x27; welfare and retirement, while a law passed in November 1894 introduced the Credit Agricole mutualist savings bank for farmers. In addition, a law passed that same month set out the role of the state-owned Caisse des depots &quot;in the construction and management of subsidised housing&quot;.

In view of the apparent likelihood that the judges of the criminal division of the court of cassation—who formed the ordinary tribunal for such an appeal—would decide in favour of Dreyfus, it was thought that Dupuy&#x27;s new cabinet would be strong enough to reconcile public opinion to such a result; but, to the surprise of outside observers, Dupuy proposed a law in the chamber transferring the decision to a full court of all the divisions of the court of cassation. This arbitrary act, though adopted by the chamber, was construed as a fresh attempt to maintain the judgment of the first court-martial. In the interim, President Félix Faure (an anti-Dreyfusard) died, and the accession of Émile Loubet helped placate the public. The whole court of cassation decided that there must be a new court-martial, and Dupuy at once resigned (June 1899). 
Although none of Dupuy&#x27;s presidential bids were successful, he served, due to his position as Prime Minister, as an Acting President of the French Republic for three separate occasions during vacancies.

In June 1900 Dupuy was elected senator for the Haute-Loire department.
He was reelected on 7 January 1906 and 11 January 1920, holding office until his death on 23 July 1923.

<text>Ray Stannard Baker (April 17, 1870 – July 12, 1946) (also known by his pen name David Grayson) was an American journalist, historian, biographer, and writer.

==Biography==
Baker was born in Lansing, Michigan. After graduating from the Michigan State Agricultural College (now Michigan State University), he attended law school at the University of Michigan in 1891 before launching his career as a journalist in 1892 with the &quot;Chicago News-Record,&quot; where he covered the Pullman Strike and Coxey&#x27;s Army in 1894.

In 1896, Ray Stannard Baker married Jessie Beal. They had four children: Alice Beal (1897), James Stannard (1899), Roger Denio (1902), and Rachel Moore (1906).

In 1898, Baker joined the staff of &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, a pioneer muckraking magazine, and quickly rose to prominence along with Lincoln Steffens and Ida Tarbell. He also dabbled in fiction, writing children&#x27;s stories for the magazine &quot;Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; and a nine-volume series of stories about rural living in America, the first of which was titled &quot;Adventures in Contentment&quot; (1907) under his pseudonym David Grayson, which reached millions of readers worldwide.

In 1907, dissatisfied with the muckraker label, Baker, Steffens, and Tarbell left &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; and founded &quot;The American Magazine&quot;. In 1908, after the 1906 Atlanta Race Riot got him involved, Baker published the book &quot;Following the Color Line: An Account of Negro Citizenship in the American Democracy&quot;, becoming the first prominent journalist to examine America&#x27;s racial divide; it was extremely successful. Sociologist Rupert Vance says it is:

He followed up that work with numerous articles in the following decade.

In 1910, he moved to the town of Amherst, Massachusetts.

In 1912, Baker published &quot;The Friendly Road&quot;, an account of the places he visited and people he met while on a walking tour of the United States. In that year&#x27;s presidential election Baker supported the presidential candidacy of Woodrow Wilson, which led to a close relationship between the two men, and in 1918 Wilson sent Baker to Europe to study the war situation. He was in connection with the future president of Czechoslovak Republic Thomas Garrigue Masaryk in America yet, from May 1918. During peace negotiations, Baker served as Wilson&#x27;s press secretary at Versailles. He eventually published 15 volumes about Wilson and internationalism, including the six-volume &quot;The Public Papers of Woodrow Wilson&quot; (1925–1927) with William Edward Dodd, and the 8-volume &quot;Woodrow Wilson: Life and Letters&quot; (1927–1939), the last two volumes of which won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography in 1940. He served as an adviser on Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s 1944 film &quot;Wilson&quot;.

Baker wrote two autobiographies, &quot;Native American&quot; (1941) and &quot;American Chronicle&quot; (1945).

Baker died of a heart attack in Amherst, Massachusetts, and is buried in Amherst&#x27;s Wildwood Cemetery. Buildings have been named in honor of both Ray Stannard Baker and David Grayson (his pen name). A dormitory, Grayson Hall, is at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The David Grayson Elementary School is in Waterford, Michigan. An academic building, Baker Hall, is at Michigan State University. A trail in Amherst has also been named for Baker.

Baker&#x27;s brother Hugh Potter Baker was the president of Massachusetts State College, which later became the University of Massachusetts.

<text>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the virus SARS-CoV-1, the first identified strain of the SARS-related coronavirus. The first known cases occurred in November 2002, and the syndrome caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. In the 2010s, Chinese scientists traced the virus through the intermediary of Asian palm civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in Xiyang Yi Ethnic Township, Yunnan.

SARS was a relatively rare disease; at the end of the epidemic in June 2003, the incidence was 8,422 cases with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 11%. No cases of SARS-CoV-1 have been reported worldwide since 2004.

In December 2019, a second strain of SARS-CoV was identified: SARS-CoV-2. This strain causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease behind the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Signs and symptoms ==
SARS produces flu-like symptoms which may include fever, muscle pain, lethargy, cough, sore throat, and other nonspecific symptoms. SARS often leads to shortness of breath and pneumonia, which may be direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia.

The average incubation period for SARS is four to six days, although it is rarely as short as one day or as long as 14 days.

== Transmission ==
The primary route of transmission for SARS-CoV is contact of the mucous membranes with respiratory droplets or fomites. As with all respiratory pathogens once presumed to transmit via respiratory droplets, it is highly likely to be carried by the aerosols generated during routine breathing, talking, and even singing. While diarrhea is common in people with SARS, the fecal–oral route does not appear to be a common mode of transmission. The basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV, R0, ranges from 2 to 4 depending on different analyses. Control measures introduced in April 2003 reduced the R to 0.4.

== Diagnosis ==

SARS-CoV may be suspected in a patient who has:
* Any of the symptoms, including a fever of or higher, and
* Either a history of:
** Contact (sexual or casual) with someone with a diagnosis of SARS within the last 10 days or
** Travel to any of the regions identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as areas with recent local transmission of SARS.
* Clinical criteria of Sars-CoV diagnosis
** Early illness: equal to or more than 2 of the following: chills, rigors, myalgia, diarrhea, sore throat (self-reported or observed)
** Mild-to-moderate illness: temperature of &gt; plus indications of lower respiratory tract infection (cough, dyspnea)
** Severe illness: ≥1 of radiographic evidence, presence of ARDS, autopsy findings in late patients.

For a case to be considered probable, a chest X-ray must be indicative for atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The WHO has added the category of &quot;laboratory confirmed SARS&quot; which means patients who would otherwise be considered &quot;probable&quot; and have tested positive for SARS based on one of the approved tests (ELISA, immunofluorescence or PCR) but whose chest X-ray findings do not show SARS-CoV infection (e.g. ground glass opacities, patchy consolidations unilateral).

The appearance of SARS-CoV in chest X-rays is not always uniform but generally appears as an abnormality with patchy infiltrates.

==Prevention==
There is a vaccine for SARS, although in March 2020 immunologist Anthony Fauci said the CDC developed one and placed it in the Strategic National Stockpile. That vaccine is a final product and field-ready as of March 2022. Clinical isolation and vaccination remain the most effective means to prevent the spread of SARS. Other preventive measures include:
* Hand-washing with soap and water, or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer
* Disinfection of surfaces of fomites to remove viruses
* Avoiding contact with bodily fluids
* Washing the personal items of someone with SARS in hot, soapy water (eating utensils, dishes, bedding, etc.)
* Avoiding travel to affected areas
* Wearing masks and gloves
* Keeping people with symptoms home from school
* Simple hygiene measures
* Distancing oneself at least 6 feet if possible to minimize the chances of transmission of the virus

Many public health interventions were made to try to control the spread of the disease, which is mainly spread through respiratory droplets in the air, either inhaled or deposited on surfaces and subsequently transferred to a body&#x27;s mucous membranes. These interventions included earlier detection of the disease; isolation of people who are infected; droplet and contact precautions; and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks and isolation gowns. A 2017 meta-analysis found that for medical professionals wearing N-95 masks could reduce the chances of getting sick up to 80% compared to no mask. A screening process was also put in place at airports to monitor air travel to and from affected countries.

SARS-CoV is most infectious in severely ill patients, which usually occurs during the second week of illness. This delayed infectious period meant that quarantine was highly effective; people who were isolated before day five of their illness rarely transmitted the disease to others.

As of 2017, the CDC was still working to make federal and local rapid-response guidelines and recommendations in the event of a reappearance of the virus.

== Treatment ==

As SARS is a viral disease, antibiotics do not have direct effect but may be used against bacterial secondary infection. Treatment of SARS is mainly supportive with antipyretics, supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation as needed. While ribavirin is commonly used to treat SARS, there seems to have little to no effect on SARS-CoV, and no impact on patient&#x27;s outcomes. There is currently no proven antiviral therapy. Tested substances, include ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, type I interferon, that have thus far shown no conclusive contribution to the disease&#x27;s course. Administration of corticosteroids, is recommended by the British Thoracic Society/British Infection Society/Health Protection Agency in patients with severe disease and O2 saturation of &lt;90%.

People with SARS-CoV must be isolated, preferably in negative-pressure rooms, with complete barrier nursing precautions taken for any necessary contact with these patients, to limit the chances of medical personnel becoming infected. In certain cases, natural ventilation by opening doors and windows is documented to help decreasing indoor concentration of virus particles.

Some of the more serious damage caused by SARS may be due to the body&#x27;s own immune system reacting in what is known as cytokine storm.

===Vaccine===
Vaccines can help the immune system to create enough antibodies and decrease a risk of side effects like arm pain, fever, and headache. According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In early 2004, an early clinical trial on volunteers was planned. A major researcher&#x27;s 2016 request, however, demonstrated that no field-ready SARS vaccine had been completed because likely market-driven priorities had ended funding.

==Prognosis==
Several consequent reports from China on some recovered SARS patients showed severe long-time sequelae. The most typical diseases include, among other things, pulmonary fibrosis, osteoporosis, and femoral necrosis, which have led in some cases to the complete loss of working ability or even self-care ability of people who have recovered from SARS. As a result of quarantine procedures, some of the post-SARS patients have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder.

==Epidemiology==

SARS was a relatively rare disease; at the end of the epidemic in June 2003, the incidence was 8,422 cases with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 11%.

The case fatality rate (CFR) ranges from 0% to 50% depending on the age group of the patient. Patients under 24 were least likely to die (less than 1%); those 65 and older were most likely to die (over 55%).

As with MERS and COVID-19, SARS resulted in significantly more deaths of males than females.


=== Outbreak in South China ===
The SARS epidemic began in the Guangdong province of China in November 2002. The earliest case developed symptoms on 16 November 2002. The index patient, a farmer from Shunde, Foshan, Guangdong, was treated in the First People&#x27;s Hospital of Foshan. The patient died soon after, and no definite diagnosis was made on his cause of death. Despite taking some action to control it, Chinese government officials did not inform the World Health Organization of the outbreak until February 2003. This lack of openness caused delays in efforts to control the epidemic, resulting in criticism of the People&#x27;s Republic of China from the international community. China officially apologized for early slowness in dealing with the SARS epidemic.
In 2003, when the virus broke out in China, a 72 year old with SARS infected multiple people on board an Air China Boeing 737, causing 5 deaths.
The viral outbreak was subsequently genetically traced to a colony of cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in Xiyang Yi Ethnic Township, Yunnan.

The outbreak first came to the attention of the international medical community on 27 November 2002, when Canada&#x27;s Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), an electronic warning system that is part of the World Health Organization&#x27;s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), picked up reports of a &quot;flu outbreak&quot; in China through Internet media monitoring and analysis and sent them to the WHO. While GPHIN&#x27;s capability had recently been upgraded to enable Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish translation, the system was limited to English or French in presenting this information. Thus, while the first reports of an unusual outbreak were in Chinese, an English report was not generated until 21 January 2003. The first super-spreader was admitted to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital in Guangzhou on 31 January, which soon spread the disease to nearby hospitals.

In early April 2003, after a prominent physician, Jiang Yanyong, pushed to report the danger to China, there appeared to be a change in official policy when SARS began to receive a much greater prominence in the official media. Some have directly attributed this to the death of an American teacher, James Earl Salisbury, in Hong Kong. It was around this same time that Jiang Yanyong made accusations regarding the undercounting of cases in Beijing military hospitals. After intense pressure, Chinese officials allowed international officials to investigate the situation there. This revealed problems plaguing the aging mainland Chinese healthcare system, including increasing decentralization, red tape, and inadequate communication.

Many healthcare workers in the affected nations risked their lives and died by treating patients, and trying to contain the infection before ways to prevent infection were known.

===Spread to other regions===
The epidemic reached the public spotlight in February 2003, when an American businessman traveling from China, Johnny Chen, became affected by pneumonia-like symptoms while on a flight to Singapore. The plane stopped in Hanoi, Vietnam, where the patient died in Hanoi French Hospital. Several of the medical staff who treated him soon developed the same disease despite basic hospital procedures. Italian doctor Carlo Urbani identified the threat and communicated it to WHO and the Vietnamese government; he later died from the disease.

The severity of the symptoms and the infection among hospital staff alarmed global health authorities, who were fearful of another emergent pneumonia epidemic. On 12 March 2003, the WHO issued a global alert, followed by a health alert by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Local transmission of SARS took place in Toronto, Ottawa, San Francisco, Ulaanbaatar, Manila, Singapore, Taiwan, Hanoi and Hong Kong whereas within China it spread to Guangdong, Jilin, Hebei, Hubei, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Tianjin, and Inner Mongolia.

====Hong Kong====
The disease spread in Hong Kong from Liu Jianlun, a Guangdong doctor who was treating patients at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital. He arrived in February and stayed on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel in Kowloon, infecting 16 of the hotel visitors. Those visitors traveled to Canada, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam, spreading SARS to those locations.

Another larger cluster of cases in Hong Kong centred on the Amoy Gardens housing estate. Its spread is suspected to have been facilitated by defects in its bathroom drainage system that allowed sewer gases including virus particles to vent into the room. Bathroom fans exhausted the gases and wind carried the contagion to adjacent downwind complexes. Concerned citizens in Hong Kong worried that information was not reaching people quickly enough and created a website called sosick.org, which eventually forced the Hong Kong government to provide information related to SARS in a timely manner. The first cohort of affected people were discharged from hospital on 29 March 2003.

====Canada====

The first case of SARS in Toronto was identified on 23 February 2003. Beginning with an elderly woman, Kwan Sui-Chu, who had returned from a trip to Hong Kong and died on 5 March, the virus eventually infected 257 individuals in the province of Ontario. The trajectory of this outbreak is typically divided into two phases, the first centring around her son Tse Chi Kwai, who infected other patients at the Scarborough Grace Hospital and died on 13 March. The second major wave of cases was clustered around accidental exposure among patients, visitors, and staff within the North York General Hospital. The WHO officially removed Toronto from its list of infected areas by the end of June 2003.

The official response by the Ontario provincial government and Canadian federal government has been widely criticized in the years following the outbreak. Brian Schwartz, vice-chair of Ontario&#x27;s SARS Scientific Advisory Committee, described public health officials&#x27; preparedness and emergency response at the time of the outbreak as &quot;very, very basic and minimal at best&quot;. Critics of the response often cite poorly outlined and enforced protocol for protecting healthcare workers and identifying infected patients as a major contributing factor to the continued spread of the virus. The atmosphere of fear and uncertainty surrounding the outbreak resulted in staffing issues in area hospitals when healthcare workers elected to resign rather than risk exposure to SARS.

===Identification of virus===
In late February 2003, Italian doctor Carlo Urbani was called into The French Hospital of Hanoi to look at Johnny Chen, an American businessman who had fallen ill with what doctors thought was a bad case of influenza. Urbani realized that Chen&#x27;s ailment was probably a new and highly contagious disease. He immediately notified the WHO. He also persuaded the Vietnamese Health Ministry to begin isolating patients and screening travelers, thus slowing the early pace of the epidemic. He subsequently contracted the disease himself, and died in March 2003.

Malik Peiris and his colleagues became the first to isolate the virus that causes SARS, a novel coronavirus now known as SARS-CoV-1. By June 2003, Peiris, together with his long-time collaborators Leo Poon and Guan Yi, has developed a rapid diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-1 using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The CDC and Canada&#x27;s National Microbiology Laboratory identified the SARS genome in April 2003. Scientists at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands demonstrated that the SARS coronavirus fulfilled Koch&#x27;s postulates thereby suggesting it as the causative agent. In the experiments, macaques infected with the virus developed the same symptoms as human SARS patients.

==== Origin and animal vectors ====
In late May 2003, a study was conducted using samples of wild animals sold as food in the local market in Guangdong, China. The study found that &quot;SARS-like&quot; coronaviruses could be isolated from masked palm civets (&quot;Paguma&quot; sp.). Genomic sequencing determined that these animal viruses were very similar to human SARS viruses, however they were phylogenetically distinct, and so the study concluded that it was unclear whether they were the natural reservoir in the wild. Still, more than 10,000 masked palm civets were killed in Guangdong Province since they were a &quot;potential infectious source.&quot; The virus was also later found in raccoon dogs (&quot;Nyctereuteus&quot; sp.), ferret badgers (&quot;Melogale&quot; spp.), and domestic cats.

In 2005, two studies identified a number of SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese bats. Phylogenetic analysis of these viruses indicated a high probability that SARS coronavirus originated in bats and spread to humans either directly or through animals held in Chinese markets. The bats did not show any visible signs of disease, but are the likely natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses. In late 2006, scientists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of Hong Kong University and the Guangzhou Centre for Disease Control and Prevention established a genetic link between the SARS coronavirus appearing in civets and in the second, 2004 human outbreak, bearing out claims that the disease had jumped across species.

It took 14 years to find the original bat population likely responsible for the SARS pandemic. In December 2017, &quot;after years of searching across China, where the disease first emerged, researchers reported ... that they had found a remote cave in Xiyang Yi Ethnic Township, Yunnan province, which is home to horseshoe bats that carry a strain of a particular virus known as a coronavirus. This strain has all the genetic building blocks of the type that triggered the global outbreak of SARS in 2002.&quot; The research was performed by Shi Zhengli, Cui Jie, and co-workers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, China, and published in &quot;PLOS Pathogens&quot;. The authors are quoted as stating that &quot;another deadly outbreak of SARS could emerge at any time. The cave where they discovered their strain is only a kilometre from the nearest village.&quot; The virus was ephemeral and seasonal in bats. In 2019, a similar virus to SARS caused a cluster of infections in Wuhan, eventually leading to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A small number of cats and dogs tested positive for the virus during the outbreak. However, these animals did not transmit the virus to other animals of the same species or to humans.

===Containment===
The World Health Organization declared severe acute respiratory syndrome contained on 5 July 2003. The containment was achieved through successful public health measures. In the following months, four SARS cases were reported in China between December 2003 and January 2004.

While SARS-CoV-1 probably persists as a potential zoonotic threat in its original animal reservoir, human-to-human transmission of this virus may be considered eradicated because no human case has been documented since four minor, brief, subsequent outbreaks in 2004.

=== Laboratory accidents ===
After containment, there were four laboratory accidents that resulted in infections.
* One postdoctoral student at the National University of Singapore in Singapore in August 2003
* A 44-year-old senior scientist at the National Defense University in Taipei in December 2003. He was confirmed to have the SARS virus after working on a SARS study in Taiwan&#x27;s only BSL-4 lab. The Taiwan CDC later stated the infection occurred due to laboratory misconduct.
* Two researchers at the Chinese Institute of Virology in Beijing, China around April 2004, who spread it to around six other people. The two researchers contracted it 2 weeks apart.

Study of live SARS specimens requires a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility; some studies of inactivated SARS specimens can be done at biosafety level 2 facilities.

==Society and culture==
Fear of contracting the virus from consuming infected wild animals resulted in public bans and reduced business for meat markets in southern China and Hong Kong. The WHO declared the end of the pandemic on 24 March 2004.

<text>The Tidal River is a perennial river of the West Gippsland catchment, located in the Wilsons Promontory region of the Australian state of Victoria. A permanent camping ground which the river flows passed to the south is also called Tidal River.

==Location and features==
The Tidal River rises below Mount Latrobe, part of the Wilson Range within the Wilsons Promontory National Park, and flows generally west by south before reaching its mouth within Norman Bay at the seasonal settlement of , and emptying into Bass Strait. The river descends over its course.

The colour of the Tidal River ranges from a deep-yellow (in shallower areas) to a dark-purple and almost black (in its deeper depths). This discolouration is due to the large number of tea trees present in the area. The trees dye the river, making it appear like black tea (hence the name &#x27;tea tree&#x27;). Even though the water is very clean and clear, it is impossible to see to the bottom in the deep areas. Few water creatures inhabit the river.

==Etymology==
As its name suggests, Tidal River swells with the tide. When a high tide occurs at the same time as a large amount of precipitation, the river can flood the tracks and boardwalks surrounding the area. The river runs into Norman Beach, one of the &#x27;safer&#x27; beaches of the promontory. Because of its proximity to the beach and the types of rocks in the area, the Tidal River bed is composed purely of fine sand. The sand can be walked on when the tide it is low. However, it is very squishy and squelchy, due to the fineness of the sand particles mixed with the surrounding dirt.

== Walking and hiking ==
Tidal River settlement is the starting point of numerous short and not-so-short walks. Probably the most popular is the overnight hike, the Great Prom Walk, to South Point and the Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse on South East Point. South Point (the most southerly point of the Australian mainland) is mostly unremarkable of itself, and is easily overshadowed by South East Point, the site of the Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse. The hike to the Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse, with detour to South Point, is over . The return walk, via a different path (and no detour) is a little over .

One of the most popular walks for campers staying at the Tidal River campsite is the Squeaky Beach walk, an enjoyable walk which passes over the ridge separating Norman and Squeaky Beach. As its name suggests, Squeaky Beach, squeaks when walked on (an example of Singing sand). This is due to the ultra-fine quartz sand particles, all of which are the same size and shape. The beach is very popular among children as it has many large rocks that can be climbed. The water, however, is very rough and often full of rips. The beach also has a small stream, similar in colour to Tidal River.

==The campground==

Tidal River is the main location for accommodation and camping in Wilsons Promontory National Park. Tidal River Campground has 484 camping and caravan sites (including 20 powered sites) situated near the beach and river. There are also 11 remote walk-in sites located within the park.

Tidal River camping ground is nestled in sand dunes behind Norman Bay, on the western side of the peninsula. The only road open to visitors leads from Yanakie at the park entrance to Tidal River, a distance of .

When fully occupied, the settlement of Tidal River swells to over people. There is a visitor centre open daily, a general store which serves basic supermarket and emergency items, a service station, fish and chippery and café. The outdoor cinema, established in the late 1940s, is a nostalgic favourite amongst summer campers who will sometimes line up for over an hour before tickets can be bought so they can save a seat in the front row with a blanket.

During summer a ballot is held to allocate sites from Christmas until late January. Regardless of the time of year, all accommodation must be pre-booked.

<doc id="196755" wikidata="Q504589" url="?curid=196755" title="John H. Overton">
<text>John Holmes Overton Sr. (September 17, 1875 – May 14, 1948), was an attorney and Democratic US Representative and US Senator from Louisiana. His nephew, Thomas Overton Brooks, was also a US representative, from the Shreveport-based 4th district of Louisiana.

==Family==
He was the youngest son of Judge Thomas Overton and the former Laura Waddill. His great-uncle was General and US Representative Walter Hampden Overton. Another distant relative was Thomas Overton Moore, the governor of Louisiana during the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Born in Marksville in Avoyelles Parish, Overton graduated in 1895 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1897 from Tulane University Law School in New Orleans.

In 1905, Overton married the former Ada Ruth Dismukes of Natchitoches. They had three daughters, Katharine (1910–1988), Ruth (1912–1973), and Mary Elizabeth (1916–1988), and a son, John H. Overton Jr. (1914–1946).

==Career==
Overton was admitted to the Louisiana bar in 1898. He established a law practice with four partners in Alexandria and was the city attorney as well. He was a member of the LSU Board of Supervisors.

In 1918, Overton ran for the US Senate but was defeated by Edward J. Gay, of Plaquemine, in Iberville Parish, near Baton Rouge.

Overton became a staunch supporter of Huey Long and served as Long&#x27;s counsel in the impeachment proceedings against the governor in the spring of 1929.

I&#x27;ve supported every governor that has been elected in Louisiana for twenty-five years, all on promises that they have made to the people. Not one of them has been able or, if able, willing to carry out what was expected of him. The present governor is throwing out of office the clique that all other governors promised to throw out. He is backed to the wall in his efforts to redeem his campaign pledges.

In 1931, Overton was elected to fill the now-defunct Louisiana&#x27;s 8th congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives, which had been vacated by the death of Representative James B. Aswell, of Natchitoches. Overton served in the House for less than a term: from May 12, 1931, to March 4, 1933.

In 1932, Overton unseated the two-term US Senator Edwin S. Broussard, of New Iberia, for the Democratic nomination, then equivalent to election in Louisiana. Overton was warmly endorsed by Long, who then became his Senate colleague. Six years earlier, Long had helped Broussard turn back a challenge from a conservative former governor, Jared Y. Sanders Sr., but the two had long since parted political alliances. In his autobiography, &quot;Every Man a King&quot;, Long notes that Overton won all sixty-four parishes against Broussard, including the incumbent&#x27;s own Iberia Parish. Long said that Overton had &quot;always been very kind to me. [He] let me speak in his meetings every time he ran for the Senate.&quot;

Despite his lopsided loss, Broussard alleged fraud and voter irregularities. A Senate investigating committee held months of hearings beginning in February 1933, but Overton was nevertheless seated without opposition on March 4, the first day of the congressional session. As a senator, Overton generally voted with the Conservative Coalition of Midwestern Republicans and Southern Democrats, much like Broussard.

Overton was re-elected in 1938 and 1944, as has been traditional with incumbent Democratic senators in Louisiana. His committee memberships included Appropriations, Manufactures, Commerce, and Irrigation and Reclamation. His chief area of interest was in flood control and river and harbor development.

Overton attempted to withdraw from re-election race in 1944. However, his Louisiana colleague, Allen J. Ellender, circulated a letter urging him to run. The letter was signed by all of the Senate Democrats.

==Death and legacy==
Overton&#x27;s last term was cut short by his death at National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. His remains were buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Pineville in Rapides Parish. In 1985, his house in Alexandria was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1998, Overton was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

<doc id="196758" wikidata="Q2116640" url="?curid=196758" title="USS Connecticut (BB-18)">
<text>USS &quot;Connecticut&quot; (BB-18), the fourth United States Navy ship to be named after the state of Connecticut, was the lead ship of her class of six pre-dreadnought battleships. Her keel was laid on 10 March 1903; launched on 29 September 1904, &quot;Connecticut&quot; was commissioned on 29 September 1906, as the most advanced ship in the US Navy.

&quot;Connecticut&quot; served as the flagship for the Jamestown Exposition in mid-1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown colony. She later sailed with the Great White Fleet on a circumnavigation of the Earth to showcase the US Navy&#x27;s growing fleet of blue-water-capable ships. After completing her service with the Great White Fleet, &quot;Connecticut&quot; participated in several flag-waving exercises intended to protect American citizens abroad until she was pressed into service as a troop transport at the end of World War I to expedite the return of American Expeditionary Forces from France.

For the remainder of her career, &quot;Connecticut&quot; sailed to various places in both the Atlantic and Pacific while training newer recruits to the Navy. However, the provisions of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty stipulated that many of the older battleships, &quot;Connecticut&quot; among them, would have to be disposed of, so she was decommissioned on 1 March 1923, and sold for scrap on 1 November 1923.

== Design ==

&quot;Connecticut&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , with steam provided by twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers ducted into three funnels. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by lattice masts in 1909. She had a crew of 827 officers and men, increased to 881 and later to 896.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch /45 Mark 5 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /45 guns and twelve /45 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets amidships and the 7-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty /50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. She also carried four 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Connecticut&quot; carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Connecticut&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had of armor plating. The secondary turrets had of frontal armor. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==
=== Construction ===
&quot;Connecticut&quot; was ordered on 1 July 1902. On 15 October 1902, she was awarded to the New York Naval Shipyard. She was laid down on 10 March 1903, and launched on 29 September 1904. She was sponsored by Miss Alice B. Welles, granddaughter of Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy during the American Civil War. A crowd of over 30,000 people attended the launch, as did many of the Navy&#x27;s ships. The battleships , , , , , , , and were at the ceremony, along with the protected cruisers and and the auxiliary cruiser .

Three attempts to sabotage the ship were discovered in 1904. On 31 March, rivets on the keel plates were found bored through. On 14 September, a bolt was found driven into the launching way, where it protruded some . Shortly after &quot;Connecticut&quot; was launched on 29 September, a diameter hole was discovered drilled through a steel keel plate. The ship&#x27;s watertight compartments and pumps prevented her from sinking, and all damage was repaired. The incidents prompted the Navy to post armed guards at the shipyard, and an overnight watch was kept by a Navy tug manned by Marines who had orders to shoot to kill any unauthorized person attempting to approach the ship.

As &quot;Connecticut&quot; was only 55% complete when she was launched, missing most of her upper works, protection, machinery and armament, it was two years before &quot;Connecticut&quot; was commissioned on 29 September 1906. Captain William Swift was the first captain of the new battleship. &quot;Connecticut&quot; sailed out of New York for the first time on 15 December 1906, becoming the first ship in the US Navy to ever go to sea without a sea trial. She first journeyed south to the Virginia Capes, where she conducted a variety of training exercises; this was followed by a shakedown cruise and battle practice off Cuba and Puerto Rico. During the cruise, she participated in a search for the missing steamer &quot;Ponce&quot;.

On 13 January 1907, &quot;Connecticut&quot; ran onto a reef while entering the harbor at Culebra Island. The Navy did not release any information about the grounding until press dispatches from San Juan, carrying news of the incident reached the mainland on 23 January. Even then, Navy authorities in San Juan claimed to be ignorant of the situation, and, that same day, the Navy Department itself said that they only knew that Captain Swift thought she had touched bottom and that an examination of the ship&#x27;s bottom by divers had revealed no damage. The Navy amended this the next day, releasing a statement that &quot;Connecticut&quot; had been only slightly damaged and had returned to her shakedown cruise. However, damage to the ship was much more serious than the Navy admitted; in contrast to an official statement saying that &quot;Connecticut&quot; had only &quot;touched&quot; the rocks, she actually had run full upon the reef when traversing &quot;a course well marked with buoys&quot; in &quot;broad daylight&quot; and did enough damage to probably require a dry docking. This apparent attempt at a cover-up was enough for the United States Congress to consider an official inquiry into the matter.

On 21 March, the Navy announced that Swift would be court-martialed for &quot;through negligence, causing a vessel to run upon a rock&quot; and &quot;neglect of duty in regard to the above&quot;. Along with the officer of the deck at the time of the accident, Lieutenant Harry E. Yarnell, Swift faced a court martial of seven rear admirals, a captain, and a lieutenant. He was sentenced to one year&#x27;s suspension from duty, later reduced to nine months; after about six months, the sentence was remitted on 24 October. However, he was not assigned command of another ship.

&quot;Connecticut&quot; steamed back to Hampton Roads after this, arriving on 16 April; when she arrived, Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans, commander of the Atlantic Fleet, transferred his flag from &quot;Maine&quot; to &quot;Connecticut&quot;, making her the flagship of the fleet. President Theodore Roosevelt opened the Jamestown Exposition on 25 April, and &quot;Connecticut&quot; was named as the official host of the vessels that were visiting from other countries. Sailors and marines from the ship took part in various events ashore, and foreign dignitaries, along with the governors of Virginia and Rhode Island, were hosted aboard the ship on 29 April. Evans closed the Exposition on 4 May, on the quarterdeck of &quot;Connecticut&quot;. On 10 June, &quot;Connecticut&quot; joined in the Presidential Fleet Review; she left three days later for an overhaul in the New York Naval Yard. After the overhaul, &quot;Connecticut&quot; conducted maneuvers off Hampton Roads, and target practice off Cape Cod. She was ordered back to the New York Naval Yard, once again on 6 September, for a refit that would make her suitable for use as flagship of the Great White Fleet.

=== Flagship of the Great White Fleet ===


The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression. &quot;Connecticut&quot; left the New York Naval Yard, on 5 December 1907, and arrived the next day in Hampton Roads, where the Great White Fleet would assemble with her as their flagship. After an eight-day period known as &quot;Navy Farewell Week&quot; during which festivities were held for the departing sailors, and all 16 battleships took on full loads of coal, stores, and ammunition, the ships were ready to depart. The battleship captains paid their respects to President Theodore Roosevelt on the presidential yacht , and all the ships weighed anchor and departed at 1000. They passed in review before the President, and then began traveling south.

After steaming past Cape Hatteras, the fleet headed for the Caribbean. They approached Puerto Rico, on 20 December, caught sight of Venezuela on 22 December, and later dropped anchor in Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad, making the first port visit of the Great White Fleet. With the torpedo boat flotilla that had left Hampton Roads, two weeks previously, and five colliers to fill the coal bunkers of the fleet, Port of Spain had a total of 32 US Navy ships in the harbor, making it &quot;[resemble] a US Navy base&quot;.

After spending Christmas in Trinidad, the ships departed for Rio de Janeiro, on 29 December. A ceremonial Brazilian escort of three cruisers met the task force outside Rio, and &quot;thousands of wildly cheering Brazilians lined the shore&quot;; 10 days of ceremonies, games, and festivities followed, and the stopover was so successful that the visit was the cause of a major boost in US–Brazilian relations. The fleet left Rio on 22 January 1908, still heading south, this time bound for the coaling stop of Punta Arenas, Chile.

Four cruisers from Argentina, &quot;San Martin&quot;, &quot;Buenos Ayres&quot;, &quot;9 De Julio&quot;, and &quot;Pueyrredon&quot;, all under the command of Admiral Hipolito Oliva, sailed to salute the American ships on their way to Chile. The fleet arrived at Punta Arenas, on 1 February, and spent five days in the town of 14,000. Heading north, they followed the coastline of Chile, passing in review of Chilean President Pedro Montt on 14 February, outside Valparaíso, and they were escorted to Callao, in Peru, by the cruiser &quot;Coronel Bolognesi&quot; on 19 and 20 February. Peru&#x27;s president, José Pardo, came aboard &quot;Connecticut&quot; during this time, as Rear Admiral Evans was quite ill and could not go ashore. After taking on coal, the ships steamed for Mexico on 29 February, passing in review of Pardo on board the cruiser &quot;Almirante Grau&quot; before leaving.

Arriving in Mexico, on 20 March, the fleet underwent three weeks of target practice. Rear Admiral Evans was relieved of command during this time, as he was completely bedridden and in constant pain. To get him medical attention, &quot;Connecticut&quot; set sail north at full speed on 30 March. She was met two days later by the schooner , which took the admiral to a hospital. &quot;Connecticut&quot; traveled back south to rejoin the fleet, and Rear Admiral Charles M. Thomas took Evans&#x27;s place on &quot;Connecticut&quot; as the commander of the fleet, which continued its journey north towards California.

On 5 May, Evans returned to &quot;Connecticut&quot; in time for the fleet&#x27;s sailing through the Golden Gate on 6 May, although he was still in pain. Over one million people watched the 42-ship fleet sail into the bay. After a grand parade through San Francisco, a review of the fleet by Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf, a gala reception, and a farewell address from Evans (who was retiring due to his illness and his age), the fleet left San Francisco, for Seattle, with Rear Admiral Charles Stillman Sperry as commander. The ships all underwent refits before the next leg of the voyage. The fleet left the West Coast again on 7 July, bound for Hawaii, which it reached on 16 July.

Leaving Hawaii, on 22 July, the ships next stopped at Auckland, Sydney, and Melbourne. High seas and winds hampered the ships for part of the voyage to New Zealand, but they arrived on 9 August; festivities, parades, balls, and games were staples of the visits to each city. The highlight of the austral visit was a parade of 12,000 US Navy, Royal Navy, and Commonwealth naval and military personnel in front of 250,000 people.

After stopping at Manila, in the Philippines, the fleet set course for Yokohama, Japan. They encountered a typhoon on the way on 12 October, but no ships were lost; the fleet was only delayed 24 hours. After three Japanese warships and six merchantmen escorted the Americans in, festivities began. The celebrations culminated in the Uraga, where Commodore Matthew C. Perry had anchored a little more than 50 years prior. The ships then departed on 25 October. After three weeks of exercises in the Philippines&#x27; Subic Bay, the ships sailed south on 1 December, for Singapore; they did not stop there, however, passing outside the city on 6 December. Continuing on, they stopped at Colombo, for coal from 12 to 20 December, before sailing on for the Suez Canal. It took three days for all 16 battleships to traverse the canal, even though it was closed to all other traffic. They then headed for a coaling stop at Port Said, Egypt, after which the fleet split up into individual divisions to call on different ports in the Mediterranean. The First Division, of which &quot;Connecticut&quot; was a part, originally planned to visit Italy, before moving on to Villefranche, but &quot;Connecticut&quot; and &quot;Illinois&quot; were quickly dispatched to southern Italy, on a humanitarian mission when news of the 1908 Messina earthquake reached the fleet. Seamen from the ships helped clear debris and unload supplies from the US Navy refrigerated supply ship ; Admiral Sperry received the personal thanks of King Victor Emmanuel III for their assistance.

After port calls were concluded, the ships headed for Gibraltar, where they found a conglomerate of warships from many different nations awaiting them &quot;with decks manned and horns blaring&quot;: the battleships and with the cruiser and the Second Cruiser Squadron represented Great Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy, battleships and with cruisers , and represented the Imperial Russian Navy, and various gunboats represented France and the Netherlands. After coaling for five days, the ships got under way and left for home on 6 February 1909.

After weathering a few storms, the ships met nine of their fellow US Navy ships five days out of Hampton Roads: four battleships (&quot;Maine&quot;, , , and —the latter being the only sister of &quot;Connecticut&quot; to not make the cruise), two armored cruisers, and three scout cruisers. &quot;Connecticut&quot; then led all of these warships around Tail-of-the-Horseshoe Lightship on 22 February to pass in review of President Roosevelt, who was then on the presidential yacht anchored off Old Point Comfort, ending a trip. Roosevelt boarded the ship after she anchored and gave a short speech, saying, &quot;You&#x27;ve done the trick. Other nations may do as you have done, but they&#x27;ll follow you.&quot;

=== Pre-World War I ===
Following her return from the world cruise, &quot;Connecticut&quot; continued to serve as flagship of the Atlantic Fleet, interrupted only by a March 1909 overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. After rejoining the fleet, she cruised the East Coast from her base at Norfolk, Virginia. For the rest of 1909, the battleship conducted training and participated in ceremonial observances, such as the Hudson–Fulton Celebration. In early January 1910, &quot;Connecticut&quot; left for Cuban waters and stayed there until late March when she returned to New York for a refit. After several months conducting maneuvers and battle practice off the New England coast, she left for Europe on 2 November to go on a midshipman training cruise. She arrived in Portland, England on 15 November and was present during the 1 December birthday celebration of Queen Alexandra, the queen mother. &quot;Connecticut&quot; next visited Cherbourg, France, where she welcomed visitors from the town and also hosted commander-in-chief of the French Navy &quot;Vice-Amiral&quot; Laurent Marin-Darbel, and a delegation of his officers. While there, a boat crew from &quot;Connecticut&quot; engaged a crew from the French battleship in a rowing race; &quot;Connecticut&quot;″s crew won by twelve lengths. &quot;Connecticut&quot; departed French waters for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, on 30 December, and stayed there until 17 March, when she departed for Hampton Roads.

&quot;Connecticut&quot; was the leader of the ships that passed in review during the Presidential Fleet Review in New York, on 2 November; she then remained in New York, until 12 January 1912, when she returned to Guantánamo Bay. During a March overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Yard, the battleship relinquished her role as flagship to the armored cruiser . After the overhaul&#x27;s completion, &quot;Connecticut&quot;″s activities through the end of 1912 included practicing with torpedoes in Fort Pond Bay, conducting fleet maneuvers, and battle practice off Block Island and the Virginia Capes. Stopping in New York, &quot;Connecticut&quot; conducted training exercises in Guantánamo Bay from 13 February to 20 March; during this time (on the 28th), she once again became the Atlantic Fleet flagship for a brief and final time when she served in the interim as Rear Admiral Charles J. Badger transferred his flag from to . After taking on stores in Philadelphia, &quot;Connecticut&quot; sailed for Mexico and arrived on 22 April; she was to patrol the waters near Tampico and Vera Cruz, protecting American citizens and interests during disturbances there and in Haiti.

On 22 June 1912, &quot;Connecticut&quot; departed Mexican waters for Philadelphia, where she was dry docked for three months of repairs. Upon their completion, &quot;Connecticut&quot; conducted gunnery practice off the Virginia Capes. On 23 October, &quot;Connecticut&quot; became the flagship of the Fourth Battleship Division. After the division passed in review before Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer on the 25th, &quot;Connecticut&quot; left for Genoa, Italy, where she remained until 30 November. The battleship departed Italy for Vera Cruz and arrived on 23 December. She took refugees from Mexico to Galveston and carried officers of the Army and representative from the Red Cross back in the opposite direction.

On 29 May 1914, while still in Mexico, &quot;Connecticut&quot; relinquished the duty of flagship to , but remained in Mexico, until 2 July, when she left for Havana. Arriving there on 8 July, &quot;Connecticut&quot; embarked Madison R. Smith, the US minister to Haiti, and took him to Port-au-Prince, arriving five days later. &quot;Connecticut&quot; remained in Haiti for a month, then left for Philadelphia on 8 August and arrived there on 14 August.

&quot;Connecticut&quot; then went to Maine and the Virginia Capes, for battle practice, after which she went into the Philadelphia Naval Yard for an overhaul. After more than 15 weeks, &quot;Connecticut&quot; emerged on 15 January 1915, and steamed south to Cuba, where she conducted training exercises. During maneuvers there in March 1915, a chain wrapped around her starboard propeller, breaking the shaft and forcing her return to Philadelphia, for repairs. She remained there until 31 July, when she embarked 433 men from the Second Regiment, First Brigade, of the United States Marine Corps for transport to Port-au-Prince, where they were put ashore on 5 August, as part of the US occupation of Haiti. &quot;Connecticut&quot; delivered supplies to amphibious troops in Cap-Haïtien, on 5 September and remained near Haiti, for the next few months, supporting landing parties ashore, including detachments of Marines and sailors from &quot;Connecticut&quot; under the command of Major Smedley Butler. After departing Haiti, &quot;Connecticut&quot; arrived in Philadelphia, on 15 December, and was placed into the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

=== World War I ===
As part of the US response to Germany&#x27;s unrestricted submarine warfare, &quot;Connecticut&quot; was recommissioned on 3 October 1916. Two days later, Admiral Herbert O. Dunn made her the flagship of the Fifth Battleship Division, transferring his flag from &quot;Minnesota&quot;. &quot;Connecticut&quot; operated along the East Coast and in the Caribbean until the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917. For the duration of the war, &quot;Connecticut&quot; was based in York River, Virginia. More than 1,000 trainees—midshipmen and gun crews for merchant ships—took part in exercises on her while she sailed in Chesapeake Bay, and off the Virginia Capes.

=== Inter-war period ===
At the close of the war, &quot;Connecticut&quot; was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force for transport duty, and from 6 January – 22 June 1919, she made four voyages to return troops from France. On 6 January, she left Hampton Roads, for Brest, France, where she embarked 1,000 troops. After bringing them to New York, arriving on 2 February, &quot;Connecticut&quot; traveled back to Brest, and picked up the 53rd Pioneer Regiment, a company of Marines, and a company of military police, 1,240 troops in all. These men were delivered to Hampton Roads, on 24 March. After two months, &quot;Connecticut&quot; made another run overseas: following a short period of liberty in Paris, for her crew, she embarked 891 men variously from the 502nd Army Engineers, a medical detachment, and the Red Cross. They were dropped off in Newport News, on 22 June. On 23 June 1919, after having returned over 4,800 men, &quot;Connecticut&quot; was reassigned as flagship of the Second Battleship Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral Hilary P. Jones.

While based in Philadelphia, for the next 11 months, &quot;Connecticut&quot; trained midshipmen. On 2 May 1920, 200 midshipmen boarded the ship for a training cruise. In company with the other battleships of her squadron, &quot;Connecticut&quot; sailed to the Caribbean, and through the Panama Canal, in order to visit four ports-of-call: Honolulu, Seattle, San Francisco, and San Pedro Bay (Los Angeles and Long Beach). After visiting all four, the squadron made their way back through the canal and headed for home. However, the port engine of &quot;Connecticut&quot; gave out three days after transiting the canal, requiring &quot;New Hampshire&quot; to tow the battleship into Guantánamo Bay. The pair arrived on 28 August. The midshipmen were debarked there, and Vice Admiral Jones transferred his flag from &quot;Connecticut&quot; to his new flagship, . The Navy repair ship was dispatched from New York on 1 September to tow &quot;Connecticut&quot; to Philadelphia; they arrived at the Navy Yard there on 11 September.

On 21 March 1921, &quot;Connecticut&quot; again became the flagship of the Second Battleship Squadron when Rear Admiral Charles Frederick Hughes took command. The ships of the squadron departed Philadelphia, on 7 April, to perform maneuvers and training exercises off Cuba, though they returned to take part in the Presidential Review in Hampton Roads, on 28 April. After participating in Naval Academy celebrations on Memorial Day, &quot;Connecticut&quot; and her squadmates departed on a midshipman cruise which took them to Europe. On 28 June, &quot;Connecticut&quot; hosted a Norwegian delegation that included King Haakon VII, Prime Minister Otto Blehr, the Minister of Defence, and the First Sea Lord of the Royal Norwegian Navy. After arriving in Portugal, on 21 July, the battleship hosted the civil governor of the province of Lisbon and the commander-in-chief of the Portuguese Navy. Six days later, &quot;Connecticut&quot; hosted the Portuguese president, António José de Almeida. The battleship squadron departed for Guantánamo Bay, on 29 July, and, after arrival there, remained for gunnery practice and exercises. &quot;Connecticut&quot;, leaving the rest of the squadron, departed for Annapolis, and disembarked her midshipmen on 30 August, then proceeded to Philadelphia.

&quot;Connecticut&quot; departed Philadelphia, for California, on 4 October, for duty with the Pacific Fleet. After touching at San Diego, on 27 October, she arrived on 28 October, at San Pedro, where Rear Admiral H.O. Stickney designated her the flagship of Pacific Fleet Training. For the next few months, &quot;Connecticut&quot; cruised along the West Coast, taking part in exercises and commemorations. Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, which set tonnage limits for its signatory nations, the Navy designated &quot;Connecticut&quot; for scrapping. Getting under way for her final voyage on 11 December, she made a five-day journey to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, where she was decommissioned on 1 March 1923. On 1 November 1923, the ex-&quot;Connecticut&quot; was sold for scrap to Walter W. Johnson, of San Francisco, for $42,750. In June 1924, the tug set a record for the largest tow by a single tug in history when she towed &quot;Connecticut&quot; from Seattle to Oakland, California, for scrapping.

<text>The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (SFE) is an English language reference work on science fiction, first published in 1979. It has won the Hugo, Locus and British SF Awards. Two print editions appeared in 1979 and 1993. A third, continuously revised, edition was published online from 2011; a change of web host was announced as the launch of a fourth edition in 2021.

== History ==
=== First edition ===
The first edition, edited by Peter Nicholls with John Clute, was published by Granada in 1979. It was retitled &quot;The Science Fiction Encyclopedia&quot; when published by Doubleday in the United States. Accompanying its text were numerous black and white photographs illustrating authors, book and magazine covers, film and TV stills, and examples of artists&#x27; work.

=== Second edition ===
A second edition, jointly edited by Nicholls and Clute, was published in 1993 by Orbit in the UK and St. Martin&#x27;s Press in the US. The second edition contained 1.3 million words, almost twice the 700,000 words of the 1979 edition. The 1995 paperback edition included a sixteen-page addendum (dated &quot;7 August 1995&quot;). Unlike the first edition, the print versions did not contain illustrations. There was also a CD-ROM version in 1995, styled variously as &quot;The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Grolier Science Fiction&quot;. This contained text updates through 1995, hundreds of book covers and author photos, a small number of old film trailers, and author video clips taken from the TVOntario series &quot;Prisoners of Gravity&quot;.

The companion volume, published after the second print edition and following its format closely, is &quot;The Encyclopedia of Fantasy&quot; edited by John Clute and John Grant.

=== Third edition ===
In July 2011, Orion Publishing Group announced that the third edition of &quot;The Science Fiction Encyclopedia&quot; would be released online later that year by SFE Ltd in association with Victor Gollancz, Orion&#x27;s science fiction imprint. The &quot;beta text&quot; of the third edition launched online on 2 October 2011, with editors John Clute, David Langford, Peter Nicholls (as editor emeritus until his death in 2018) and Graham Sleight. 

The encyclopedia is updated regularly (usually several times a week) by the editorial team with material written by themselves and contributed by science fiction academics and experts. It received the Hugo Award for Best Related Work in 2012. Though the &quot;SFE&quot; is a composite work with a considerable number of contributors, the three main editors (Clute, Langford and Nicholls) have themselves written almost two-thirds of the 5.2 million words to date (September 2016), giving a sense of unity to the whole.

=== Fourth edition ===
The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; ended its arrangement with Orion on 29 September 2021 and moved to a new, self-owned web server. The move was completed by 6 October 2021, and announced as the launch of the fourth edition. While based on the earlier design, the new edition incorporates a number of revisions; for instance, many author entries now include thumbnails of the author&#x27;s book covers, randomly selected from the relevant Gallery pages.

== Contents ==
&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; contains entries under the categories of authors, themes, terminology, science fiction in various countries, films, filmmakers, television, magazines, fanzines, comics, illustrators, book publishers, original anthologies, awards, and miscellaneous.

The online edition of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; was released in October 2011 with 12,230 entries, totaling 3,200,000 words. The editors predicted that it would contain 4,000,000 words upon completion of the first round of updates at the end of 2012; this figure was actually reached in January 2013, and 5,000,000 words in November 2015.

== Reception ==
Writer Ian Watson reviewed the first edition in 1980, the journal &quot;Foundation&quot;. Watson noted his positive surprise that the publication contains much smaller amount of errors than expected, and noted that its format allows for easy correction of those in the expected second edition. He concluded that the &quot;volume &quot;is&quot; a genuine encyclopedia - the first such. It is the &quot;Britannica&quot; of the sf field&quot;, positively commenting on the breadth and scope of the entries, and even the illustrations, which are informative, and not just decorations.

Edward James, a British scholar of medieval history and science fiction, praised the second edition of the encyclopedia in his review (also for the journal &quot;Foundation&quot;) in 1993, writing that it is &quot;the one indispensable volume on every sf readers&#x27; shelf: not only the best reference work in the field, but one of the best reference works I have seen in &quot;any&quot; field&quot;. He did, however, found the &quot;sneering&quot; tone of some film entries (de facto film reviews) less than ideal for an encyclopedia. James also noted that although the project is a collaborative effort, nearly half of the entries for that edition have been written by Clute, which he saw as a very impressive achievement on his part.

Writer Gary Westfahl also reviewed the second edition, for the journal &quot;Extrapolation&quot;. He called it &quot;an invaluable compendium of and contribution to fifty years of science fiction research&quot;, representing &quot;a true conceptual breakthrough&quot; for the field of science fiction studies, and noted that even more than the encyclopedia&#x27;s previous edition, this one &quot;is the one essential reference book for anyone interested in science fiction&quot;. He also predicted that &quot;this work will justifiably be cited in all studies of science fiction during the next decade, and those studies will be significantly better because of Clute and Nicholl&#x27;s painstaking work&quot;. Nonetheless he noted that the volume is not perfect, and contains some errors as well as several entries on novel topics that could use more grounding in prior research before being written about in an encyclopedia&quot;.

Nicholas Ruddick briefly commented on the second edition, noting that it has been &quot;highly praised&quot;.

Briefly commenting on the third edition, Andrew M. Butler called it &quot;a gold standard for reference works in the field&quot;.

The encyclopedia also received several other reviews, by writers and scholars such as Gary K. Wolfe, Don D&#x27;Ammassa and David G. Hartwell.

<text>Nicholas Kaldor, Baron Kaldor (12 May 1908 – 30 September 1986), born Káldor Miklós, was a Hungarian-born British economist. He developed the &quot;compensation&quot; criteria called Kaldor–Hicks efficiency for welfare comparisons (1939), derived the cobweb model, and argued for certain regularities observable in economic growth, which are called Kaldor&#x27;s growth laws. Kaldor worked alongside Gunnar Myrdal to develop the key concept Circular Cumulative Causation, a multicausal approach where the core variables and their linkages are delineated.

==Biography==
Káldor Miklós was born in Budapest, son of Gyula Káldor, lawyer and legal adviser to the German legation in Budapest, and Jamba, an accomplished linguist and &quot;a well-educated, cultured woman&quot;. He was educated in Budapest, as well as in Berlin, and at the London School of Economics, where he graduated with a first-class BSc (Econ.) degree in 1930. He subsequently became an assistant lecturer and, by 1938, lecturer and reader in economics at the LSE. Between 1943 and 1945, Kaldor worked for the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and in 1947 he resigned from the LSE to become Director of Research and Planning at the Economic Commission for Europe. He was elected to a Fellowship at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and offered a lectureship in the Economics Faculty of the University in 1949. He became a Reader in Economics in 1952, and Professor in 1966.

From 1964, Kaldor was an advisor to the Labour government of the UK and also advised several other countries, producing some of the earliest memoranda regarding the creation of value added tax. Inter alia, Kaldor was considered, with his fellow-Hungarian Thomas Balogh, one of the intellectual authors of the 1964–1970 Harold Wilson&#x27;s government&#x27;s short-lived Selective Employment Tax (SET) designed to tax employment in service sectors while subsidising employment in manufacturing. In 1966, he became professor of economics at the University of Cambridge. On 9 July 1974, Kaldor was made a life peer as Baron Kaldor, of Newnham in the City of Cambridge.

In 1969–1970, Kaldor was involved in a fierce debate with the U.S. monetarist economist Milton Friedman. While Friedman defended the exogenous money supply theory, according to which money is created by powerful central banks, Kaldor and Post-Keynesian economists claimed that money is created by second-tier banks through the distribution of credits to households and companies. In the Post-Keynesian framework, central banks only refinance second-tier banks on demand, but they are unable to properly create money. Despite insightful contributions, Kaldor could not initially win the debate, as monetarist policies where implemented by most central banks. He would, however, later be vindicated by empirical findings and policy, with money creation now being generally agreed to be mostly endogenous. In 1982, he published a book entitled &quot;The Scourge of Monetarism&quot;, deeply criticizing monetarist-inspired policies. 

Kaldor was invited by then Prime Minister of India—Jawaharlal Nehru—to design an expenditure tax system for India in the 1950s. He also went to India&#x27;s Centre for Development Studies (CDS) in 1985 to inaugurate and deliver the first Joan Robinson Memorial Lecture. Owing to these links, the Kaldor family donated his entire personal collection to the CDS Library. There are 362 books in the collection and they cover a wide range of titles on economic theory, classical political economy, business cycles and history of economic thought.

==Business cycle theory==

After the publication of John Maynard Keynes&#x27; General Theory, many attempts were made to build a business cycle model. The models that were built by American Neo-Keynesians such as Paul Samuelson proved unstable. They could not describe why an economy should cycle through recession and growth in a stable fashion. The British Neo-Keynesian John Hicks tried to improve the theory by imposing rigid ceilings and floors on the model. But most people thought that this was a poor way of explaining the cycle as it relied on artificial, exogenous constraints. Kaldor, however, had actually invented a fully coherent and highly realistic account of the business cycle in 1940. He used non-linear dynamics to construct this theory. Kaldor&#x27;s theory was similar to Samuelson&#x27;s and Hicks&#x27; as it used a multiplier-accelerator model to understand the cycle. It differed from these theories, however, as Kaldor introduced the capital stock as an important determinant of the trade cycle. This was in keeping with Keynes&#x27; sketch of the business cycle in his General Theory.

Following Keynes, Kaldor argued that investment depended positively on income and negatively on the accumulated capital stock. The idea that investment depends positively on the growth of income is simply the idea of the accelerator model that holds that in periods of high income growth and hence demand growth, investment should rise in the anticipation of high income and demand growth in the future. The intuition lying behind the negative relationship to the accumulation of the capital stock is due to the fact that if firms have a very large amount of productive capacity accumulated already they will not be as inclined to invest in more. Kaldor was in effect integrating Roy Harrod&#x27;s ideas about unbalanced growth into his theory.

In the standard accelerator model that stood behind Samuelson&#x27;s and Hicks&#x27; business cycle theories investment was determined as such:

This states that investment is determined by exogenous investment and lagged income multiplied by the accelerator coefficient. Kaldor&#x27;s model modified this to include a negative coefficient for the capital stock:

Kaldor then assumed that the investment and savings functions are non-linear. He argued that at the peaks and troughs of the cycle the marginal propensity to save shifts in opposite ways. The intuition behind this is that during recessions people will cut their savings to maintain their standard of living while at high levels of income people will save a larger proportion of their income. He also argued that at the peaks and troughs of the cycle the marginal propensity to invest shifts. The intuition behind this is that at the trough of the cycle there will be a large amount of excess capacity and so businessmen will not want to invest more, while at the peak of the cycle rising costs will discourage investment. This creates non-linear dynamics in the economy that then drive the business cycle.

When Kaldor combines these components we get a clear six-stage model of the business cycle. In the first stage the economy is in equilibrium position. Investment is taking place and the capital stock is growing. In the second stage the growth in the capital stock leads to a downward shift in the investment curve as businessmen decide their factories become overfull. In the third stage (which overlaps with the second stage) the high growth in income causes higher saving which pushes the savings curve upwards. At this point the two curves become tangential and the equilibrium becomes unstable which generates a recession. In the fourth stage the same dynamics kick in but this time moving in the opposite direction. By the sixth stage the equilibrium is again unstable and a boom is produced.

Kaldor also noted the importance of income distribution in his theory of the business cycle. He assumed that savings out of profits were higher than savings out of wages; that is, he argued that poorer people (workers) tend to save less than richer people (capitalists). Or:

Kaldor believed that the business cycle had an inherent mechanism built into it that redistributed income across the cycle and that these mitigated &quot;explosive&quot; results. As we have seen, in a cyclical upswing where planned investment begins to outstrip planned savings prices will tend to rise. Kaldor assumed that those who set prices have more power than those who set wages and so prices will tend to rise faster than wages. This means that profits must also rise faster than wages. Kaldor argued that due to the different savings propensities of capitalists and workers this will lead to higher savings. This will then dampen the cycle somewhat. In a recession or depression Kaldor argued that prices should fall faster than wages for the same reasons that Keynes laid out in his General Theory. This meant that income would be redistributed to workers as real wages rose. This would lead savings to fall in a recession or depression and so would dampen the cycle.

Kaldor&#x27;s model assumes wage and price flexibility. If wage and price flexibility are not forthcoming the economy may have a tendency to either perpetual and rising inflation or persistent stagnation. Kaldor also makes strong assumptions about how wages and prices respond in both inflations and depressions. If these assumptions do not hold Kaldor&#x27;s model would lead us to conclude that the cycle might give way to either perpetual and rising inflation or stagnation.

Kaldor&#x27;s non-linear business cycle theory overcomes the difficulty that many economists had with Roy Harrod&#x27;s growth theory. Many of the American Neo-Keynesian economists thought that Harrod&#x27;s work implied that capitalism would tend toward extremes of zero and infinite growth and that there were no dynamics that might keep it in check. Robert Solow, who eventually created the Solow Growth Model in response to these perceived problems, summarised this view as such:

In fact, Kaldor&#x27;s 1940 paper had already shown this to be completely untrue. Solow was working with an erroneous and underdeveloped theory of the business cycle that he had taken over from Samuelson. By the time Solow was working on his growth theory, the Cambridge UK economists had already satisfactorily laid out a self-limiting theory of the business cycle that they thought was a reasonable description of the real world. This is one of the reasons that the Cambridge economists were so hostile in their reaction to Solow&#x27;s growth model and went on to attack it in the Cambridge Capital Controversy of the 1960s. The ignorance on the part of the American economists&#x27; knowledge of Kaldor&#x27;s model also explains why the Cambridge Post-Keynesian economists found the ISLM model favoured by the American Neo-Keynesians to be crude and lacking.

==Personal life==
Kaldor was married to Clarissa Goldsmith. They had four daughters.

He died in Papworth Everard, Cambridgeshire.

<doc id="196767" wikidata="Q184862" url="?curid=196767" title="John Hicks">
<text>Sir John Richard Hicks (8 April 1904 – 20 May 1989) was a British economist. He is considered one of the most important and influential economists of the twentieth century. The most familiar of his many contributions in the field of economics were his statement of consumer demand theory in microeconomics, and the IS–LM model (1937), which summarised a Keynesian view of macroeconomics. His book &quot;Value and Capital&quot; (1939) significantly extended general-equilibrium and value theory. The compensated demand function is named the Hicksian demand function in memory of him.

In 1972 he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (jointly) for his pioneering contributions to general equilibrium theory and welfare theory.

==Early life==
Hicks was born in 1904 in Warwick, England, and was the son of Edward Hicks, editor and part proprietor of the Warwick and Leamington Spa Courier newspaper, and Dorothy Catherine, née Stephens, daughter of a non-conformist minister.

He was educated at Clifton College (1917–1922) and at Balliol College, Oxford (1922–1926), and was financed by mathematical scholarships. During his school days and in his first year at Oxford, he specialised in mathematics but also had interests in literature and history. In 1923, he moved to Philosophy, Politics and Economics, the &quot;new school&quot; that was just being started at Oxford. He graduated with second-class honours and, as he stated, &quot;no adequate qualification in any of the subjects&quot; that he had studied.

==Career==
From 1926 to 1935, Hicks lectured at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He started as a labour economist and did descriptive work on industrial relations but gradually, he moved over to the analytical side, where his mathematics background returned to the fore. Hicks&#x27;s influences included Lionel Robbins and such associates as Friedrich von Hayek, R.G.D. Allen, Nicholas Kaldor, Abba Lerner and Ursula Webb, the last of whom, in 1935, became his wife.

From 1935 to 1938, he lectured at Cambridge where he was also a fellow of Gonville &amp; Caius College. He was occupied mainly in writing &quot;Value and Capital&quot;, which was based on his earlier work in London. From 1938 to 1946, he was Professor at the University of Manchester. There, he did his main work on welfare economics, with its application to social accounting.

In 1946, he returned to Oxford, first as a research fellow of Nuffield College (1946–1952) then as Drummond Professor of Political Economy (1952–1965) and finally as a research fellow of All Souls College (1965–1971), where he continued writing after his retirement.

==Later life==
Hicks was knighted in 1964 and became an honorary fellow of Linacre College. He was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (with Kenneth J. Arrow) in 1972. He donated the Nobel Prize to the London School of Economics and Political Science&#x27;s Library Appeal in 1973. He died on 20 May 1989 at his home in the Cotswold village of Blockley.

==Contributions to economic analysis==

Hicks&#x27;s early work as a labour economist culminated in &quot;The Theory of Wages&quot; (1932, 2nd ed. 1963), still considered standard in the field. He collaborated with R.G.D. Allen in two seminal papers on value theory published in 1934.

His magnum opus is &quot;Value and Capital&quot; published in 1939. The book &quot;built&quot; on ordinal utility and mainstreamed the now-standard distinction between the substitution effect and the income effect for an individual in demand theory for the 2-good case. It generalised the analysis to the case of one good and a composite good, that is, all other goods. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the aggregation problem, most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced general equilibrium theory to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory for dynamic analysis, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium. In the course of analysis Hicks formalised comparative statics. In the same year, he also developed the famous &quot;compensation&quot; criterion called Kaldor–Hicks efficiency for welfare comparisons of alternative public policies or economic states.

Hicks&#x27;s most familiar contribution in macroeconomics was the Hicks–Hansen IS–LM model, published in his paper “Mr. Keynes and the &quot;Classics&quot;; a suggested interpretation”. This model formalised an interpretation of the theory of John Maynard Keynes (see Keynesian economics), and describes the economy as a balance between three commodities: money, consumption and investment. Hicks himself wavered in his acceptance of his IS–LM formulation; in a paper published in 1980 he dismissed it as a ‘classroom gadget’.

==Contributions to interpretation of income for accounting purposes ==
Hicks&#x27;s influential discourse on income sets the basis for its subjectivity but relevancy for accounting purposes. He aptly summarized it as follows. “The purpose of income calculations in practical affairs is to give people an indication of the amount they can consume without impoverishing themselves”.

Formally, he defined income precisely in three measures:

Hicks&#x27;s number 1 measure of income: “the maximum amount, which can be spent during a period if there is to be an expectation of maintaining intact the capital value of prospective receipts (in money terms)” (Hicks, 1946, p. 173)

Hicks&#x27;s number 2 measure of income (market price-neutral): &quot;the maximum amount the individual can spend during a week, and still expect to be able to spend the same amount in each ensuing week” (Hicks, 1946, p. 174).

Hicks&#x27;s number 3 measure of income (takes into account market prices): “the maximum amount of money which an individual can spend this week, and still expect to be able to spend the same amount in real terms in each ensuing week” (Hicks, 1946, p. 174)

<text>USS &quot;Minnesota&quot; (BB-22), the fifth of six pre-dreadnought battleships, was the first ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the 32nd state. She was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia in October 1903, launched in April 1905, and commissioned into the US fleet in March 1907, just four months after the revolutionary British battleship entered service. &quot;Minnesota&quot; was armed with a main battery of four guns and a secondary battery of twenty 7 and 8 in (178 and 203 mm) guns, unlike &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, which carried an all-big-gun armament that rendered ships like &quot;Minnesota&quot; obsolescent.

Shortly after she entered service, &quot;Minnesota&quot; joined the Great White Fleet for its circumnavigation of the globe in 1908–1909. The years from 1909 to 1912 were uneventful, but thereafter the ship began to become involved in conflicts in the Caribbean. She supported efforts to put down an insurrection in Cuba in 1912 and patrolled the coast of Mexico in 1913–1914 during the Mexican Revolution. In 1916, the ship was placed in reserve, though she quickly returned to service when the United States entered World War I in April 1917. During the war, she trained naval personnel; while cruising off the eastern coast of the United States in September 1918, she struck a naval mine laid by a German U-boat. The extensive damage required lengthy repairs that kept her out of service for the rest of the war. She helped to return American soldiers from Europe in 1919 before resuming her training ship duties in 1920–1921, before being decommissioned in December 1921 and broken up for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1924.

==Design==
The followed the s, but corrected some of the most significant deficiencies in the earlier design, most notably the superposed arrangement of the main and some of the secondary guns. A heavier tertiary battery of guns replaced the guns that had been used on all previous US designs. Despite the improvements, the ships were rendered obsolescent by the revolutionary British battleship , completed before most of the members of the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class.

&quot;Minnesota&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , with steam provided by twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers ducted into three funnels. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by lattice masts in 1909. She had a crew of 827 officers and men, though this increased to 881 and later to 896.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch /45 Mark 5 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /45 guns and twelve /45 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets amidships and the 7-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty /50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. She also carried four 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Minnesota&quot; carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Minnesota&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had of armor plating. The secondary turrets had of frontal armor. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==
The keel for &quot;Minnesota&quot; was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia on 27 October 1903. The completed hull was launched on 8 April 1905. The ship was commissioned into the US Navy on 9 March 1907, with Captain John Hubbard as her first commanding officer. The ship then conducted a shakedown cruise off the coast of New England before attending the Jamestown Exposition, the commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown colony, the first permanent English settlement in the Americas. She was present at the ceremony from 22 April to 3 September.

On 16 December, &quot;Minnesota&quot; steamed out of Hampton Roads with the Great White Fleet for a circumnavigation of the globe. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression. The cruise was also intended to assert the United States&#x27; status as a global naval power and to convince Congress of the need to support increased naval expenditures. The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland.

The fleet then turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled . There, they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt.

Upon her return, &quot;Minnesota&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She spent the following three years on the eastern coast of the United States conducting a peacetime routine of training cruises, apart from one voyage to the English Channel in 1910. Starting in 1912, the ship began to operate in the Caribbean, particularly after unrest began to break out in several countries in the region. For the first six months of 1912, she patrolled Cuban waters; she went to the US base at Guantanmo Bay to support the suppression of an insurrection on the island from 7 to 22 June. In mid-1913, she patrolled the eastern coast of Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. She returned in 1914, with stints there from 26 January to 7 August and 11 October to 19 December. During the first period, the United States occupied Veracruz to protect US interests. In 1915, &quot;Minnesota&quot; returned to the United States and resumed her previous routine of training exercises with occasional cruises to the Caribbean. In November 1916, she was placed in reserve as the flagship of the Reserve Force, Atlantic Fleet.

===World War I===

&quot;Minnesota&quot; returned to active service after the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, entering World War I. She was assigned to Division 4 of the Battleship Force, based at Tangier Sound in Chesapeake Bay. She spent the war as a training ship for gunners and engine room personnel. During this time, Vice Admiral Albert W. Grant, the commander of Battleship Force 1, instituted a program to reinforce the bulkheads of the ships under his command. This improved their ability to absorb underwater damage and remain afloat. On 29 September 1918, while cruising off Fenwick Island with the destroyer , she struck a naval mine that had been laid by the U-boat &quot;U-117&quot;, which inflicted serious damage but caused no casualties. The explosion tore a gaping hole in the hull from frame 5 to frame 16, and from the keel to the bottom edge of the armor belt. The bow flooded, but the repaired bulkheads prevented the flooding from spreading. Reduced to a speed of , &quot;Minnesota&quot; made it back to the Philadelphia Navy Yard where repairs were effected. The work lasted for five months, by which time Germany had signed the Armistice that ended the war.

On 11 March 1919, &quot;Minnesota&quot; returned to service with the Cruiser and Transport Force, making three trips to Brest, France to bring American soldiers back from the battlefields of Europe. In the course of the voyages, she brought back over 3,000 men; this duty ended on 23 July. The ship spent the next two years as a training ship for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy. She conducted two summer cruises in 1920 and 1921 before being decommissioned on 1 December 1921. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day and was sold for scrap on 23 January 1924. &quot;Minnesota&quot; was thereafter broken up for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

<doc id="196771" wikidata="Q3213519" url="?curid=196771" title="The Browning Version (play)">
<text>The Browning Version is a play by Terence Rattigan, seen by many as his best work, and first performed on 8 September 1948 at the Phoenix Theatre, London. It was originally one of two short plays, jointly titled &quot;Playbill&quot;; the companion piece being &quot;Harlequinade&quot;, which forms the second half of the evening. &quot;The Browning Version&quot; is set in a boys&#x27; public school and the Classics teacher in the play, Crocker-Harris, is believed to have been based on Rattigan&#x27;s Classics tutor at Harrow School, 
J. W. Coke Norris (1874–1961).

==Plot==
Andrew Crocker-Harris is a classics teacher at an English boys&#x27; school. After eighteen years of teaching there, today is his last day before moving on to a position at another school. The students speculate on why he is leaving, but do not much care since despite being academically brilliant, he is generally despised as being strict, stern and humourless. They have nicknamed him &quot;The Crock&quot;. Even the school administrators treat him poorly regardless of his long tenure. Millie Crocker-Harris, his wife, is younger and vivacious and quite different from her husband. She no longer loves him but instead loves Frank Hunter, another teacher, yet despite having an affair with him she knows that he is not in love with her. On this last day, one student named Taplow, who does not hate Crocker-Harris but feels sorry for him, gives him a small going-away gift – a copy of the translation by Robert Browning of Aeschylus&#x27;s ancient play &quot;Agamemnon&quot;. The gift brings about a series of actions which make Crocker-Harris reflect on his past, contemplate his future, and evaluate how he is going to finish his tenure at the school.

==Original production==
In the original production, Crocker-Harris was played by Eric Portman, and his wife by Mary Ellis. Barry Jones took over the role of Crocker-Harris, with the run ending on 9 April 1949. Reviews were enthusiastic, with the play being hailed as &quot;a 70 minute masterpiece.&quot;

*Millie Crocker-Harris – Mary Ellis
*Andrew Crocker-Harris – Eric Portman
*Dr. Frobisher – Campbell Cotts

Decor by Paul Sheriff.

==Original Broadway production==
In 1949, the play was performed on Broadway, opening on 12 October at the Coronet Theater on 49th street with Maurice Evans and Edna Best. The play and its companion-piece &quot;Harlequinade&quot; failed to find favour with New York critics (with &quot;Time&quot; calling it &quot;bilge&quot;), and it closed after 62 performances. Peter Scott-Smith as John Taplow was the sole member of the West End cast to reprise his role on Broadway.

==Revivals==
The Royalty Theatre produced the play in the West End of London with its counterpart &quot;Harlequinade&quot; in 1988, starring Paul Eddington and Dorothy Tutin as Andrew and Millie Crocker Harris, with a stellar supporting cast including Jean Anderson, John Duttine, Daniel Beales, Jack Watling and Simon Shepherd. It was directed by Tim Luscombe.

The Theatre Royal Bath put the play on in 2009 in a double bill with Chekhov&#x27;s one-act play &quot;Swansong&quot;, both starring Peter Bowles. A production at the Chichester Festival Theatre (alongside &quot;South Downs&quot;, a new play written in response to it by David Hare) marked Rattigan&#x27;s centenary in 2011. The same double production of &quot;The Browning Version&quot; and &quot;South Downs&quot; ran at London&#x27;s Harold Pinter Theatre from April through July 2012 and starred Nicholas Farrell as Crocker-Harris and Anna Chancellor as Millie.

==Adaptations==
The play has been adapted twice for the cinema, and at least four television versions. The 1951 film version, starring Michael Redgrave as Crocker-Harris, won two awards at the Cannes Film Festival, one for Rattigan&#x27;s screenplay (with which he lengthened the original stage version for the final speech), the other for Redgrave&#x27;s performance. It was remade in 1994, starring Albert Finney, Michael Gambon, Greta Scacchi, Matthew Modine, Julian Sands and young Ben Silverstone.
A British television production was broadcast in 1955, starring Peter Cushing as Crocker-Harris. John Frankenheimer directed John Gielgud in a 1959 television version for CBS. In 1960, Maurice Evans repeated his Broadway role for CBC Television under the sponsorship of Ford of Canada in their Startime series. Another made-for-TV version in 1985 starred Ian Holm as the main character for the BBC.

A radio version was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in June 2011. It was directed by Martin Jarvis, and featured Michael York, Joanne Whalley, Ioan Gruffudd and Ian Ogilvy. An earlier version was broadcast on the BBC Home Service in September 1957. It was directed by Norman Wright and adapted by Cynthia Pughe with John Gielgud, Angela Baddeley, Brewster Mason and Anthony Adams.

A staged reading was performed on 3 April 2012 at The Players Club in New York City, presented by TAPT (The Artists&#x27; Playground Theater), directed by Alex Kelly and starring Matthew Dure&#x27;, Robert Lyons, Nichole Donje&#x27; Jeffrey Hardy, Steven Hauck, Max Rhyser, Jessica Beaudry and Kate Downey.

<text>Thomas Overton Brooks (December 21, 1897 – September 16, 1961) was a Democratic U.S. representative from the Shreveport-based Fourth Congressional District of northwestern Louisiana, having served for a quarter century beginning on January 3, 1937.

Of a prominent family, Brooks was a nephew of U.S. Senator John Holmes Overton and a great-grandson of Walter Hampden Overton. At the time of his death, he was chairman of the House Science and Astronautics Committee.

==Before politics==
Brooks was born in Baton Rouge to Claude M. Brooks and the former Penelope Overton. He graduated from public schools. Brooks served overseas during World War I as an enlisted man in the Sixth Field Artillery, First Division, Regular Army, 1918–1919.

After the war, he obtained a degree in 1923 from Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. He was admitted to the bar and began his practice in Shreveport in Caddo Parish in the northwestern corner of his state.

On June 1, 1932, Brooks married the former Mary Fontaine &quot;Mollie&quot; Meriwether, a daughter of Minor Meriwether, a planter and banker originally from Hernando, Mississippi, and the former Anne Finley McNutt, both of whom died in Shreveport. Overton and Mollie Brooks had one child, Laura Anne Brooks (1936-1994), who like her mother died in Houston, Texas.

==Political career==

=== 1940 ===
Brooks faced a showdown with Henry Andrew O&#x27;Neal, a Shreveport insurance agent originally from Linden in Cass County, Texas. In the primary election, state Representative Wellborn Jack of Caddo Parish and J. Frank Colbert, the former mayor of Minden, were eliminated from further consideration. In the second round of balloting, Brooks received 19,375 votes (55.6 percent) to O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s 15,450 (44.4 percent).

In 1947–8, he served on the Herter Committee.

===1948===

In 1948, Brooks defeated two intra-party rivals Harvey Locke Carey of Minden, a former short-term U.S. attorney for the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, and former State Senator Lloyd Hendrick, a Natchitoches Parish native residing in Shreveport.

===1950===

=== 1952 ===
He decried inflated home prices and large federal withholding rates from paychecks so that many could &quot;barely buy groceries.&quot; May claimed that Brooks had given tacit support of a &quot;Marxist&quot; foreign policy: We cannot return sanity in foreign affairs by returning to Congress the same men who got us into this mess.&quot;

=== 1956 ===
Brooks was reelected to Congress twelve times. In 1956, he signed the Southern Manifesto, a failed congressional attempt to block desegregation of public schools ordered by the United States Supreme Court in the case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. For a time the publisher Ned Touchstone of Bossier City worked on Brooks&#x27; staff. Brooks also urged the strengthening national defense, the expanded production of natural gas, rural electrification, and &quot;fair prices&quot; for farm, dairy, and ranch products.

===1960, the last congressional race===
In 1960, during a KKK rally led by Roy Davis, a cross was burnt in the front yard of Brooks&#x27; home leading to a police investigation and the arrest of Roy Davis.

In Brooks&#x27; last election to Congress in 1960, he faced another Republican challenger, Fred Charles McClanahan Jr. (1918–2007), a contractor from Shreveport who was reared in Homer in Claiborne Parish. McClanahan flew sixty-eight combat missions in World War II and received the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal, and the Purple Heart. His wife, Mary, an educator, was active in the League of Women Voters. George Despot, later a state Republican chairman, was his campaign manager. McClanahan called for a two-party system, which he maintained would &quot;bring us new recognition and respect in national affairs and stabilize state government with a constant watchdog ...&quot; McClanahan, who endorsed the Nixon-Lodge ticket, called for the United States &quot;to lead the free world in resisting the spread of communism and winning the Cold War in this hemisphere and in every country. ... Our foreign aid program must be re-evaluated on the basis of our aims...&quot; Like Brooks, McClanahan affirmed his support for states&#x27; rights and segregation, having proclaimed &quot;No right of the United States government to force integration in public schools.&quot;

Brooks prevailed in his final race, 74-26 percent, though the Kennedy-Johnson ticket did not carry the Fourth Congressional District.

==Committee service==

Brooks served on the U.S. House Committee on Armed Services from 1947 to 1958, and he then became the first chairman of the newly formed House Space Committee (later Science and Astronautics), reportedly because his seniority entitled him to a more important post on Armed Services than he was considered capable of handling. He was reappointed in 1961. It was Brooks who proposed a civilian, rather than military, space program. On May 4, 1961, his committee sent a memo to then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson on this subject. U.S. President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s speech which prompted the development of the Apollo program was delivered a few weeks later.

The Overton Brooks Veterans Administration Medical Center at 510 East Stoner Street in Shreveport south of Interstate 20 and viewed from along the Clyde Fant Parkway is named in his honor.

Two conservative legislative assistants to Representative Brooks, Ned Touchstone and Billy McCormack, went on to careers of their own in advocacy journalism and the Christian ministry.

===1961 Rules Committee vote===

==Death and legacy==
A few months after the roll call vote on enlargement of the House Rules Committee, Brooks died of a heart attack at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.

Speaker Rayburn died exactly two months after Brooks.

Brooks was a member of the Masonic Lodge, the Shriners, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Kiwanis International.

Brooks is interred at Forest Park Cemetery East in Shreveport, the resting place of many Shreveport politicians. He was Episcopalian.

The Veterans Administration Hospital in Shreveport was renamed for Brooks in 1988.

<text>Amy Lawrence Lowell (February 9, 1874 – May 12, 1925) was an American poet of the imagist school. She posthumously won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1926.

==Life==
Amy Lowell was born on February 9, 1874, in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Augustus Lowell and Katherine Bigelow Lowell. A member of the Brahmin Lowell family, her siblings included the astronomer Percival Lowell, the educator and legal scholar Abbott Lawrence Lowell, and Elizabeth Lowell Putnam, an early activist for prenatal care. They were the great-grandchildren of John Lowell and, on their mother&#x27;s side, the grandchildren of Abbott Lawrence.

School was a source of considerable despair for the young Amy Lowell. She considered herself to be developing &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot; features and she was a social outcast. She had a reputation among her classmates for being outspoken and opinionated. At fifteen she wanted to be a photographer, poet, and coach racer.

Lowell never attended college because her family did not consider it proper for a woman to do so. She compensated for this lack with avid reading and near-obsessive book collecting. She lived as a socialite and travelled widely, turning to poetry in 1902 (aged 28) after being inspired by a performance of Eleonora Duse in Europe. After beginning a career as a poet when she was well into her 30s, Lowell became an enthusiastic student and disciple of the art.

Lowell was a lesbian, and in 1912 she met the actress Ada Dwyer Russell, who would become her lover. Russell is the subject of many of Lowell&#x27;s more erotic works, most notably the love poems contained in &#x27;Two Speak Together&#x27;, a subsection of &quot;Pictures of the Floating World&quot;. The two women traveled to England together, where Lowell met Ezra Pound, who at once became a major influence and a major critic of her work. Pound considered Lowell&#x27;s embrace of Imagism to be a kind of hijacking of the movement. Lowell has been linked romantically to writer Mercedes de Acosta, but the only evidence of any contact between them is a brief correspondence about a planned memorial for Duse.

Lowell was a short but imposing figure who kept her hair in a bun and wore a pince-nez.

Lowell publicly smoked cigars, as newspapers of the day frequently mentioned. A glandular problem kept her perpetually overweight. Poet Witter Bynner once said, in a comment frequently misattributed to Ezra Pound, that she was a &quot;hippopoetess&quot;. Her admirers defended her, however, even after her death. One rebuttal was written by Heywood Broun in his obituary tribute to Amy. He wrote, &quot;She was upon the surface of things a Lowell, a New Englander and a spinster. But inside everything was molten like the core of the earth ... Given one more gram of emotion, Amy Lowell would have burst into flame and been consumed to cinders.&quot;

Lowell died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1925, at the age of 51 and is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery. The following year, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for &quot;What&#x27;s O&#x27;Clock&quot;. That collection included the patriotic poem &quot;Lilacs&quot;, which Louis Untermeyer said was the poem of hers he liked best.

Her first published work appeared in 1910 in &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. The first published collection of her poetry, &quot;A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass&quot;, appeared two years later, in 1912. An additional group of uncollected poems was added to the volume &quot;The Complete Poetical Works of Amy Lowell&quot;, published in 1955 with an introduction by Untermeyer, who considered himself her friend.

Though she sometimes wrote sonnets, Lowell was an early adherent to the &quot;free verse&quot; method of poetry and one of the major champions of this method. She defined it in her preface to &quot;Sword Blades and Poppy Seed&quot; in the &quot;North American Review&quot; for January 1917; in the closing chapter of &quot;Tendencies in Modern American Poetry&quot;; and also in &quot;The Dial&quot; (January 17, 1918), as: &quot;The definition of vers libre is: a verse-formal based upon cadence. To understand vers libre, one must abandon all desire to find in it the even rhythm of metrical feet. One must allow the lines to flow as they will when read aloud by an intelligent reader. Or, to put it another way, unrhymed cadence is &quot;built upon &#x27;organic rhythm,&#x27; or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical system. Free verse within its own law of cadence has no absolute rules; it would not be &#x27;free&#x27; if it had.&quot;

Untermeyer writes that &quot;She was not only a disturber but an awakener.&quot; In many poems, Lowell dispenses with line breaks, so that the work looks like prose on the page. This technique she labeled &quot;polyphonic prose&quot;.

Throughout her working life, Lowell was a promoter of both contemporary and historical poets. Her book &quot;Fir-Flower Tablets&quot; was a poetical re-working of literal translations of the works of ancient Chinese poets, notably Li Tai-po (701–762). Her writing also included critical works on French literature. At the time of her death, she was attempting to complete her two-volume biography of John Keats (work on which had long been frustrated by the noncooperation of F. Holland Day, whose private collection of Keatsiana included Fanny Brawne&#x27;s letters to Frances Keats). Lowell wrote of Keats: &quot;the stigma of oddness is the price a myopic world always exacts of genius.&quot;

Lowell published not only her own work, but also that of other writers. According to Untermeyer, she &quot;captured&quot; the Imagist movement from Ezra Pound. Pound threatened to sue her for bringing out her three-volume series &quot;Some Imagist Poets&quot;, and thereafter derisively called the American Imagists the &quot;Amygist&quot; movement. Pound criticized her as not an imagist, but merely a rich woman who was able to financially assist the publication of imagist poetry. She said that Imagism was weak before she took it up, whereas others said it became weak after Pound&#x27;s &quot;exile&quot; towards Vorticism.

D.H. Lawrence dedicated his 1918 book New Poems &quot;To Amy Lowell&quot;. 

Lowell wrote at least two poems about libraries—The &quot;Boston Athenaeum&quot; and &quot;The Congressional Library&quot;—during her career. A discussion of libraries also appears in her essay &quot;Poetry, Imagination, and Education&quot;.

==Relationship with Ada Dwyer Russell==


Lowell&#x27;s partner Ada Dwyer Russell was the subject of many of Lowell&#x27;s romantic poems, and Lowell wanted to dedicate her books to Russell, but Russell would not allow that, and relented only once for Lowell&#x27;s biography of John Keats, in which Lowell wrote, &quot;To A.D.R., This, and all my books. A.L.&quot; Examples of these love poems to Russell include &quot;the Taxi&quot;, &quot;Absence&quot;, &quot;A Lady&quot; &quot;In a Garden&quot;, &quot;Madonna of the Evening Flowers&quot;, &quot;Opal&quot;, and &quot;Aubade&quot;. Lowell admitted to John Livingston Lowes that Russell was the subject of her series of romantic poems titled &quot;Two Speak Together&quot;. Lowell&#x27;s poems about Russell have been called the most explicit and elegant lesbian love poetry during the time between the ancient Sappho and poets of the 1970s. Most of the private correspondence in the form of romantic letters between the two were destroyed by Russell at Lowell&#x27;s request, leaving much unknown about the details of their life together.

==Legacy==
In the post-World War I years, Lowell was largely forgotten, but the women&#x27;s movement in the 1970s and women&#x27;s studies brought her back to light. According to Heywood Broun, however, Lowell showed little political interest in feminism. Within the realm of literature, though, she spoke highly of contemporary female poets such as Edna St. Vincent Millay. She also drew inspiration from her female predecessors in poetry; her poem &quot;The Sisters&quot; explores in depth her thoughts on Sappho, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Emily Dickinson.

Additional sources of interest in Lowell today come from the anti-war sentiment of the oft-taught poem &quot;Patterns&quot;; her personification of inanimate objects, as in &quot;The Green Bowl&quot;, and &quot;The Red Lacquer Music Stand&quot;; and her lesbian themes, including the love poems addressed to Ada Dwyer Russell in &quot;Two Speak Together.&quot;

Lowell&#x27;s correspondence with her friend Florence Ayscough, a writer and translator of Chinese literature, was compiled and published by Ayscough&#x27;s husband Professor Harley Farnsworth MacNair in 1945.

<text>USS &quot;Colorado&quot; (BB-45) was a battleship of the United States Navy that was in service from 1923 to 1947. She was the lead ship of the of battleships. Her keel was laid down on 29 May 1919, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. She was launched on 22 March 1921, and commissioned on 30 August 1923. She was armed with eight guns and fourteen 5-inch (127 mm) deck guns; two 5-inch guns were removed in an overhaul.

&quot;Colorado&quot; took her maiden voyage in 1923, to Europe. She later operated with the Battle Fleet and sailed through the Pacific during the interwar years. She also underwent a further refit, during which her four anti-aircraft guns were replaced with an equal number of /25 cal guns.

During World War II, in May 1942, soon after USA&#x27;s entry into the war, &quot;Colorado&quot; undertook a defensive patrol near the Golden Gate Bridge to stop a possible Japanese invasion. She then sailed to Fiji, to stop any further Japanese advance into the Pacific. Next, she supported the landings on Tarawa, the Marshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, and Tinian. On 24 July 1944, during the shelling of Tinian, &quot;Colorado&quot; received 22 shell hits from shore batteries, but continued to support the invading troops until 3 August. She later arrived in Leyte Gulf on 20 November 1944, to support American troops fighting ashore. On 27 November, she was hit by two &quot;kamikazes&quot; which caused moderate damage.

After that, &quot;Colorado&quot; sailed to Luzon on 1 January 1945, where she participated in the preinvasion bombardments in Lingayen Gulf. She returned to Okinawa on 6 August and sailed from there to Japan for the occupation of the country, arriving in Tokyo on 27 August. Departing Tokyo Bay on 20 September, she arrived at San Francisco on 15 October. She was placed out of commission in reserve in Pearl Harbor on 7 January 1947, and sold for scrapping on 23 July 1959. She won seven battle stars during her service. Many of &quot;Colorado&quot;″s anti-aircraft guns are in museums across the state of Colorado (her bell and teak decking are also in museums and the USO in the Seattle-Tacoma airport) or mounted on the museum ship .

== Design ==

In 1916, design work was completed on the next class of battleships to be built for the United States Navy beginning in 1917. These ships were nearly direct copies of the preceding , with the exception of the main battery, which increased from twelve guns to eight guns. The &quot;Colorado&quot; class proved to be the last class of battleships completed of the standard type.

&quot;Colorado&quot; was long overall and she had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric turbo-electric drives with steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The ship&#x27;s propulsion system was rated at for a top speed of , though on speed trials she reached and a speed of . She had a normal cruising range of at , but additional fuel space could be used in wartime to increase her range to at that speed. Her crew numbered 64 officers and 1,241 enlisted men.

She was armed with a main battery of eight 16 in /45 caliber Mark 1 guns in four twin-gun turrets on the centerline, two forward and two aft in superfiring pairs. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen /51 caliber guns, mounted individually in casemates clustered in the superstructure amidships. She carried an anti-aircraft battery of eight /50 caliber guns in individual high-angle mounts. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she had a torpedo tube mounted in her hull below the waterline on each broadside. &quot;Colorado&quot;″s main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces on barbettes. Her conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==

=== Inter-war period ===
Her keel was laid down on 29 May 1919 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey. Named for the 38th state, she was launched on 22 March 1921 and commissioned on 30 August 1923 for her initial sea trials and training. The ship&#x27;s first commanding officer was Captain Reginald R. Belknap. On 29 December 1923, &quot;Colorado&quot; departed New York, bound for Portsmouth in the United Kingdom. She thereafter sailed south to visit Cherbourg and then Villefranche-sur-Mer, France. She also stopped in Naples, Italy, and the British naval base at Gibraltar. She arrived back in New York on 15 February 1924. There, the ship underwent repairs and further testing before getting underway on 11 July for the West Coast of the United States. She reached San Francisco, California on 15 September, where she joined the Battle Fleet. She remained a part of this unit for the next fifteen years.

Over the course of the 1920s and 1930s, &quot;Colorado&quot; took part in the series of Fleet Problems, which were large-scale training exercises held annually. These took place in the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea. During this period, she also took part in various ceremonies and naval reviews with the rest of the fleet. From 8 June to 26 September 1925, the ship participated in a voyage to visit American Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand with several other battleships of the fleet. She ran aground on the Diamond Shoals off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on 1 May 1927, but was refloated on 2 May 1927. &quot;Colorado&quot; was overhauled in 1928–1929, during which her four anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eight /25 caliber guns. From 10 to 11 March 1933, the ship went to Long Beach, California, to assist in relief efforts following an earthquake.

In the summer of 1937 &quot;Colorado&quot; was the training ship for NROTC students from the University of Washington and University of California, Berkeley. She embarked the University of Washington students in Puget Sound on 15 June, and the University of California students four days later in San Francisco Bay. The ship arrived in Hilo, Hawaii, on 26 June and sailed two days later for Lahaina Roads, where the students practiced firing the 5&quot;/51 caliber guns in whose casemates they were berthed in hammocks. Liberty in Honolulu began on 1 July, but was interrupted the following day so &quot;Colorado&quot; could join the search for Amelia Earhart. She rendezvoused with the United States Coast Guard cutter on 7 July; and launched seaplanes to search the Phoenix Islands. After holding a line-crossing ceremony on 9 July, she returned the NROTC students to their schools on the west coast.

=== World War II ===

From 27 January 1941, &quot;Colorado&quot; was based in Pearl Harbor undergoing intensive training exercises and taking part in several war games until 25 June, when she departed Hawaii for the West Coast. Undergoing overhaul at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, she was not present for the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December. During the refit, her 5in/51 battery was reduced to 8, both to create space for more anti-aircraft guns and to free up some to arm merchant ships against surface raiders.

After refit &quot;Colorado&quot; carried out extensive training maneuvers along the West Coast. On 31 May, she and patrolled near Golden Gate Bridge to protect San Francisco from any Japanese attack. Some time after this she returned to Pearl Harbor to complete her final preparations for action. She operated in the vicinity of the Fiji Islands and New Hebrides from 8 November 1942 to 17 September 1943 to prevent any further Japanese expansion in the Pacific. She sailed from Pearl Harbor on 21 October 1943 to provide pre-invasion shelling and fire support for the invasion of Tarawa, returning to port on 7 December 1943. After another overhaul on the West Coast, &quot;Colorado&quot; returned to Lahaina Roads, in the Hawaiian Islands, on 21 January 1944 and sortied the next day for the Marshall Islands. She provided the pre-invasion bombardment and fire support for the invasions of Kwajalein and Eniwetok until 23 February, when she headed for the Puget Sound Navy Yard for another overhaul.

She joined other units going for the Mariana Islands at the harbor at San Francisco. She departed on 5 May passing Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein to the pre-invasion shelling at Saipan, Guam, and Tinian after 14 June. During the shelling of Tinian on 24 July she was damaged, 43 men were killed, and 198 wounded by 22 shell hits from 150mm Japanese shore batteries; she continued shelling the island and providing fire support for the invasion troops. After undergoing extensive repairs along the West Coast, she arrived in Leyte Gulf to begin the invasion of Leyte. A week after her arrival she was struck by two &quot;kamikaze&quot; bombers, which killed 19 crewmembers, injured 72, and moderately damaged the ship. Despite the damage, she bombarded Mindoro on schedule from 12 to 17 December 1944. She then proceeded to Manus Island for urgent repairs.

She returned to Luzon on New Year&#x27;s Day 1945 to participate in the pre-invasion shelling of Lingayen Gulf. She was hit by accidental gunfire eight days later. The gunfire hit her superstructure, and caused 69 casualties (18 killed, 51 wounded). After a few repairs at the island of Ulithi, she joined Task Force 54 (TF 54), the pre-invasion shelling group for the invasion of Okinawa, at Kerama Retto. She stayed at Okinawa until 22 May, providing anti-aircraft cover and fire support for the invasion troops. On 6 August, she returned to the occupied Okinawa to sail to Japan for its occupation. On 27 August, she covered the airborne occupation of Atsugi Airfield. &quot;Colorado&quot; was awarded seven battle stars for her World War II service.

===Post war===
&quot;Colorado&quot; departed Tokyo Bay on 20 September 1945 for San Francisco. She arrived there on 15 October, and then sailed for Seattle for Navy Day (27 October). She was part of the Operation Magic Carpet force, making three runs to Pearl Harbor to transport 6357 soldiers home, before returning to Bremerton Navy Yard for her deactivation. She was placed out of commission in reserve on 7 January 1947 and was sold for scrap on 23 July 1959.

== Artifacts on display ==
The ship&#x27;s bell and helm is currently on display in the University of Colorado Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps, Wardroom. A /51 cal deck gun from &quot;Colorado&quot; was donated to the Puget Sound Maritime Historical Society in 1959, and is displayed at the Museum of History and Industry in Seattle. It was one of eight such guns on &quot;Colorado&quot;.

Six of &quot;Colorado&quot;″s 5/51 cal guns were put aboard the protected cruiser , after she became a museum in Philadelphia in 1957. Boards from her teak-wood deck were re-purposed to form a wall in the main lounge of Haggett Hall at the University of Washington. A plaque commemorates the source. Deck boards are also used in a wall in the Legends Room of the Washington Athletic Club, having originally been preserved within the club at the behest of two former officers of the ship who were club members.

On 7 February 2014, Boeing donated some decking from &quot;Colorado&quot; to the USO Northwest SeaTac Center to serve as the new center&#x27;s entry flooring. Her helm is in the collection of the Colorado Springs Museum. It was donated to the museum in 1961 by Rear Admiral G. R. Luker and other naval officers. Admiral Luker served on &quot;Colorado&quot;. The donation also included a bronze plaque and other historical materials.

<doc id="196778" wikidata="Q710046" url="?curid=196778" title="Hugh Latimer">
<text>Hugh Latimer ( – 16 October 1555) was a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, and Bishop of Worcester during the Reformation, and later Church of England chaplain to King Edward VI. In 1555 under the Catholic Queen Mary I he was burned at the stake, becoming one of the three Oxford Martyrs of Anglicanism.

==Life==
Latimer was born into a family of farmers in Thurcaston, Leicestershire. His birthdate is unknown. Contemporary biographers including John Foxe placed the date somewhere between 1480 and 1494. He later recalled that &quot;my father...kept me to schole&quot; and he started his studies in Latin grammar at the age of four, but not much else is known of his childhood. He attended the University of Cambridge from the age of 14, where according to the &quot;Alumni Cantabrigienses&quot; he was a pupil of John Watson and probably a scholar of Peterhouse. He was elected a fellow of Clare College on 2 February 1510, and in either that or the following year was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree. He received a Master of Arts degree in April 1514 and was ordained a priest on 15 July 1515. In 1522, Latimer was nominated to the positions of university preacher and university chaplain. While carrying out his official duties, he continued with theological studies and received the Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1524. The subject of his disputation for the degree was a refutation of the new ideas of the Reformation emerging from the Continent, in particular the doctrines of Philipp Melanchthon. Up to this time, Latimer described himself as &quot;obstinate a papist as any was in England&quot;. A recent convert to the new teachings, Thomas Bilney heard his disputation and later came to him to give his confession. Bilney&#x27;s words had a great impact on Latimer and from that day forward he accepted the reformed doctrines.
Latimer joined a group of reformers including Bilney and Robert Barnes that met regularly at the White Horse Tavern. He began to preach publicly on the need for the translation of the Bible into English. This was a dangerous move as the first translation of the New Testament by William Tyndale had recently been banned. In early 1528, Latimer was called before Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and he was given an admonition and a warning. The following year, Wolsey fell from Henry VIII&#x27;s favour when he failed to expedite the annulment of Henry&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon. In contrast, Latimer&#x27;s reputation was in the ascendant as he took the lead among the reformers in Cambridge. During Advent in 1529, he preached his two &quot;Sermons on the Card&quot; at St Edward&#x27;s Church.

In 1535, he was appointed Bishop of Worcester, in succession to an Italian absentee, and promoted reformed teachings and iconoclasm in his diocese. On 22 May 1538, at the insistence of Cromwell, he preached the final sermon before Franciscan Friar John Forest was burnt at the stake, in a fire said to have been fueled partly by a Welsh image of Saint Derfel. In 1539, he opposed Henry VIII&#x27;s Six Articles, with the result that he was forced to resign his bishopric and imprisoned in the Tower of London (where he was again in 1546).
 He then served as chaplain to Katherine Duchess of Suffolk. However, when Edward VI&#x27;s sister Mary I came to the throne, he was tried for his beliefs and teachings in Oxford and imprisoned. In October 1555 he was burned at the stake outside Balliol College, Oxford.

== Trial ==
On 14 April 1554, commissioners from the papal party (including Edmund Bonner and Stephen Gardiner) began an examination of Latimer, Ridley, and Cranmer. Latimer, hardly able to sustain a debate at his age, responded to the council in writing. He argued that the doctrines of the corporeal real presence of Christ in the mass, transubstantiation, and the propitiatory merit of the mass were unbiblical. The commissioners tried to demonstrate that Latimer did not share the same faith as eminent Fathers, to which Latimer replied, &quot;I am of their faith when they say well... I have said, when they say well, and bring Scripture for them, I &quot;am&quot; of their faith; and further Augustine requireth not to be believed.&quot;

Latimer believed that the welfare of souls demanded he stand for the Protestant understanding of the gospel. The commissioners also understood that the debate involved the very message of salvation itself, by which souls would be saved or damned:

After the sentence had been pronounced, Latimer added, &#x27;I thank God most heartily that He hath prolonged my life to this end, that I may in this case glorify God by that kind of death&#x27;; to which the prolocutor replied, &#x27;If &quot;you go&quot; to heaven in this faith, then &quot;I&quot; will never come hither, as I am thus persuaded.&#x27;

==Death==

Latimer was burned at the stake along with Nicholas Ridley. He is quoted as having said to Ridley:

Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God&#x27;s grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.

The deaths of Latimer, Ridley and later Cranmer now known as the Oxford Martyrs are commemorated in Oxford by the Victorian-era Martyrs&#x27; Memorial near the actual execution site, which is marked by a cross in Broad Street, formerly the ditch outside the city&#x27;s North Gate.

Hugh Latimer said, &quot;It may come in my days, old as I am, or in my children&#x27;s days, the saints shall be taken up to meet Christ in the air, and so shall come down with Him again&quot; (cf. 1 Thessalonians 4).

==Commemoration==
Latimer and Nicholas Ridley are honoured with a commemoration on 16 October by the Church of England, the American Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada. The Latimer room in Clare College, Cambridge is named after him, as is Latimer Square in central Christchurch, New Zealand.

<doc id="196782" wikidata="Q465934" url="?curid=196782" title="Kaffir lime">
<text>Citrus hystrix, called the kaffir lime, Thai lime or makrut lime, (, ) is a citrus fruit native to tropical Southeast Asia.

Its fruit and leaves are used in Southeast Asian cuisine, and its essential oil is used in perfumery. Its rind and crushed leaves emit an intense citrus fragrance.

==Names==

&quot;Kaffir&quot; is thought to ultimately derive from the Arabic &quot;kafir&quot;, meaning &quot;infidel&quot;, though the mechanism by which it came to be applied to the lime is uncertain. Following the takeover of the Swahili coast, Muslims used the term to refer to the non-Muslim indigenous Africans, who were increasingly abducted for the Indian Ocean slave trade, which reached a height in the fifteenth and sixteenth century.

The most likely etymology is through the Kaffirs, an ethnic group in Sri Lanka partly descended from enslaved Bantu. The earliest known reference, under the alternative spelling &quot;caffre&quot; is in the 1888 book &quot;The Cultivated Oranges, Lemons Etc. of India and Ceylon&quot; by Emanuel Bonavia, who notes, &quot;The plantation coolies also smear it over their feet and legs, to keep off land leeches; and therefore in Ceylon [Sri Lanka] it has also got the name of &quot;Kudalu dchi&quot;, or Leech Lime. Europeans call it Caffre Lime.&quot; Similarly, H.F. MacMillan&#x27;s 1910 book &quot;A Handbook of Tropical Gardening and Planting&quot; notes, &quot;The &#x27;Kaffir Lime&#x27; in Ceylon.&quot;

Another proposed etymology is directly by Indian Muslims of the imported fruit from the non-Muslim lands to the east to &quot;convey otherness and exotic provenance.&quot; Claims that the name of the fruit derives directly from the South African ethnic slur &quot;kaffir&quot; &quot;(see &quot;South Africa&quot; below)&quot; are not well supported.

&quot;C. hystrix&quot; is known by various names in its native areas:

* in Javanese and in Malay (respectively into Indonesian and Malaysian) both meaning &quot;warty/rough-skinned lime&quot; due to the fruit&#x27;s bumpy texture.
* ( &quot;arrow-leaf lime&quot;) in Chinese.
* or in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC Press/Taylor &amp; Francis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Cabuyao in Laguna is named after the fruit.
*&quot;Kolumichai&quot;, கொலுமிச்சை in Kongu Tamil
* or (, ) in Thailand (a name also used for the bergamot orange).
* (, ) in Laos.
* or in Vietnam.
* in Réunion Island

The micrantha, a similar citrus fruit native to the Philippines that is ancestral to several hybrid limes, such as the Key lime and Persian lime, may represent the same species as &quot;C. hystrix&quot;, but the genomic characterization of the kaffir lime has not been performed in sufficient detail to allow a definitive conclusion.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Arabic &quot;kafir&quot; was adopted by White colonialists as &quot;kaffir,&quot; an ethnic slur for black African people. Consequently, some authors favour switching from &quot;kaffir lime&quot; to &quot;makrut lime,&quot; a less well-known name, while in South Africa, it is usually referred to as &quot;Thai lime&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;C. hystrix&quot; is a thorny shrub or small tree, tall, with aromatic and distinctively shaped &quot;double&quot; leaves. These hourglass-shaped leaves comprise the leaf blade plus a flattened, leaf-like stalk (botanically, a winged petiole). The fruit is rough and green and ripens to yellow; it is distinguished by its bumpy exterior and small size, approximately wide. The fruits have thick skins (pericarps) and taste very acidic and slightly bitter. Flowers can have four to five petals that are white in color and are fragrant.

==History==
Pierre Sonnerat (1748–1814) collected specimens of it in 1771–72, and it appears in Lamarck&#x27;s Encyclopédie Méthodique (1796).

Makrut lime appears in texts under the name of kaffir lime in 1868, in Ceylon, where rubbing the juice onto legs and socks prevents leech bites. This could be a possible origin of the name leech lime.

==Uses==
=== Culinary ===
&quot;C. hystrix&quot; leaves are used in Southeast Asian cuisines such as Indonesian, Laotian, Cambodian, and Thai. The leaves are the most frequently used part of the plant, fresh, dried, or frozen. The leaves are widely used in Thai cuisine (for dishes such as tom yum) and Cambodian cuisine (for the base paste &quot;krueng&quot;). The leaves are used in Vietnamese cuisine to add fragrance to chicken dishes and to decrease the pungent odor when steaming snails. Also, in Vietnamese villages that harvest silkworms, the silkworms in the pupa stage are stir fried with the kaffir lime leaves. The leaves are used in Indonesian cuisine (especially Balinese cuisine and Javanese cuisine) for foods such as soto ayam and are used along with Indonesian bay leaf for chicken and fish. They are also found in Malaysian and Burmese cuisines.

The rind (peel) is commonly used in Lao and Thai curry paste, adding an aromatic, astringent flavor. The zest of the fruit, referred to as combava, is used in creole cuisine to impart flavor in infused rums and rougails in Mauritius, Réunion, and Madagascar. In Cambodia, the entire fruit is crystallized/candied for eating.

===Medicinal===
The juice and rinds of the peel are used in traditional medicine in some Asian countries; the fruit&#x27;s juice is often used in shampoo and is believed to kill head lice.

===Other uses===
The juice is used as a cleanser for clothing and hair in Thailand and occasionally in Cambodia. Lustral water mixed with slices of the fruit is used in religious ceremonies in Cambodia.

Makrut lime oil is used as raw material in many fields, including pharmaceutical, agronomic, food, sanitary, cosmetic, and perfume industries. It is also used extensively in aromatherapy and as an essential ingredient in various cosmetic and beauty products.

==Cultivation==

&quot;C. hystrix&quot; is grown worldwide in suitable climates as a garden shrub for home fruit production. It is well suited to container gardens and for large garden pots on patios, terraces, and in conservatories.

==Main constituents==
The compound responsible for the characteristic aroma was identified as (–)-(&quot;S&quot;)-citronellal, which is contained in the leaf oil up to 80 percent; minor components include citronellol (10 percent), nerol and limonene.

From a stereochemical point of view, it is remarkable that makrut lime leaves contain only the (&quot;S&quot;) stereoisomer of citronellal, whereas its enantiomer, (+)-(&quot;R&quot;)-citronellal is found in both lemon balm and (to a lesser degree) lemon grass, (however, citronellal is only a trace component in the latter&#x27;s essential oil).

Makrut lime fruit peel contains an essential oil comparable to lime fruit peel oil; its main components are limonene and β-pinene.

==Toxicity==
&quot;C. hystrix&quot; contains significant quantities of furanocoumarins, in both the peel and the pulp. Furanocoumarins are known to cause phytophotodermatitis, a potentially severe skin inflammation. Cases of phytophotodermatitis induced by external use of &quot;C. hystrix&quot; have been reported.

<text>A steam locomotive is a locomotive that provides the force to move itself and other vehicles by means of the expansion of steam. It is fuelled by burning combustible material (usually coal, oil or, rarely, wood) to heat water in the locomotive&#x27;s boiler to the point where it becomes gaseous and its volume increases 1,700 times. Functionally, it is a steam engine on wheels.

In most locomotives, the steam is admitted alternately to each end of its cylinders in which pistons are mechanically connected to the locomotive&#x27;s main wheels. Fuel and water supplies are usually carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in a tender coupled to it. Variations in this general design include electrically powered boilers, turbines in place of pistons, and using steam generated externally.

Steam locomotives were first developed in the United Kingdom during the early 19th century and used for railway transport until the middle of the 20th century. Richard Trevithick built the first steam locomotive known to have hauled a load over a distance at Pen-y-darren in 1804, although he produced an earlier locomotive for trial at Coalbrookdale in 1802. &quot;Salamanca&quot;, built in 1812 by Matthew Murray for the Middleton Railway, was the first commercially successful steam locomotive. &quot;Locomotion&quot; No. 1, built by George Stephenson and his son Robert&#x27;s company Robert Stephenson and Company, was the first steam locomotive to haul passengers on a public railway, the Stockton and Darlington Railway, in 1825. Rapid development ensued; in 1830 George Stephenson opened the first public inter-city railway, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, after the success of Rocket at the 1829 Rainhill Trials had proved that steam locomotives could perform such duties. Robert Stephenson and Company was the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives in the first decades of steam for railways in the United Kingdom, the United States, and much of Europe.

Towards the end of the steam era, a longstanding British emphasis on speed culminated in a record, still unbroken, of by LNER Class A4 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot;, however there are long-standing claims that the Pennsylvania Railroad class S1 achieved speeds upwards of 150 mph, though this was never officially proven. In the United States, larger loading gauges allowed the development of very large, heavy locomotives such as the Union Pacific Big Boy, which weighs and has a tractive effort of .

Beginning in the early 1900s, steam locomotives were gradually superseded by electric and diesel locomotives, with railways fully converting to electric and diesel power beginning in the late 1930s. The majority of steam locomotives were retired from regular service by the 1980s, although several continue to run on tourist and heritage lines.

==History==
===Britain===
The earliest railways employed horses to draw carts along rail tracks. In 1784, William Murdoch, a Scottish inventor, built a small-scale prototype of a steam road locomotive in Birmingham. A full-scale rail steam locomotive was proposed by William Reynolds around 1787. An early working model of a steam rail locomotive was designed and constructed by steamboat pioneer John Fitch in the US during 1794. Some sources claim Fitch&#x27;s model was operable already by the 1780s and that he demonstrated his locomotive to George Washington. His steam locomotive used interior bladed wheels guided by rails or tracks. The model still exists at the Ohio Historical Society Museum in Columbus, US. The authenticity and date of this locomotive is disputed by some experts and a workable steam train would have to await the invention of the high-pressure steam engine by Richard Trevithick, who pioneered the use of steam locomotives.
The first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was the gauge &quot;Coalbrookdale Locomotive&quot; built by Trevithick in 1802. It was constructed for the Coalbrookdale ironworks in Shropshire in the United Kingdom though no record of it working there has survived. On 21 February 1804, the first recorded steam-hauled railway journey took place as another of Trevithick&#x27;s locomotives hauled a train along the -wide tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil, to Abercynon in South Wales. Accompanied by Andrew Vivian, it ran with mixed success. The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency.

Trevithick visited the Newcastle area in 1804 and had a ready audience of colliery (coal mine) owners and engineers. The visit was so successful that the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of the steam locomotive. Trevithick continued his own steam propulsion experiments through another trio of locomotives, concluding with the &quot;Catch Me Who Can&quot; in 1808, first in the world to haul fare-paying passengers.

In 1812, Matthew Murray&#x27;s successful twin-cylinder rack locomotive &quot;Salamanca&quot; first ran on the edge-railed rack-and-pinion Middleton Railway. Another well-known early locomotive was &quot;Puffing Billy&quot;, built 1813–14 by engineer William Hedley. It was intended to work on the Wylam Colliery near Newcastle upon Tyne. This locomotive is the oldest preserved, and is on static display at the Science Museum, London.

====George Stephenson====
George Stephenson, a former miner working as an engine-wright at Killingworth Colliery, developed up to sixteen Killingworth locomotives, including &quot;Blücher&quot; in 1814, another in 1815, and a (newly identified) &quot;Killingworth Billy&quot; in 1816. He also constructed &quot;The Duke&quot; in 1817 for the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway, which was the first steam locomotive to work in Scotland.

In 1825, Stephenson built Locomotion No. 1 for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, north-east England, which was the first public steam railway in the world. In 1829, his son Robert built in Newcastle &quot;The Rocket&quot;, which was entered in and won the Rainhill Trials. This success led to the company emerging as the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives used on railways in the UK, US and much of Europe. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened a year later making exclusive use of steam power for passenger and goods trains.

===United States===

Before the arrival of British imports, some domestic steam locomotive prototypes were built and tested in the United States, including John Fitch&#x27;s miniature prototype. A prominent full sized example was Col. John Steven&#x27;s &quot;steam wagon&quot; which was demonstrated on a loop of track in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1825.

Many of the earliest locomotives for commercial use on American railroads were imported from Great Britain, including first the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; and later the &quot;John Bull&quot;. However, a domestic locomotive-manufacturing industry was soon established. In 1830, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;, designed by Peter Cooper, was the first commercial US-built locomotive to run in America; it was intended as a demonstration of the potential of steam traction rather than as a revenue-earning locomotive. The &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot;, built in 1831 for the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, was a notable early locomotive.

, the original &quot;John Bull&quot; was on static display in the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The replica is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.

===Continental Europe===
The first railway service outside the United Kingdom and North America was opened in 1829 in France between Saint-Etienne and Lyon; it was initially limited to animal traction and converted to steam traction early 1831, using Seguin locomotives. The first steam locomotive in service in Europe outside of France was named &quot;The Elephant&quot;, which on 5 May 1835 hauled a train on the first line in Belgium, linking Mechelen and Brussels.
In Germany, the first working steam locomotive was a rack-and-pinion engine, similar to the &quot;Salamanca&quot;, designed by the British locomotive pioneer John Blenkinsop. Built in June 1816 by Johann Friedrich Krigar in the Royal Berlin Iron Foundry (&quot;Königliche Eisengießerei&quot; zu Berlin), the locomotive ran on a circular track in the factory yard. It was the first locomotive to be built on the European mainland and the first steam-powered passenger service; curious onlookers could ride in the attached coaches for a fee. It is portrayed on a New Year&#x27;s badge for the Royal Foundry dated 1816. Another locomotive was built using the same system in 1817. They were to be used on pit railways in Königshütte and in Luisenthal on the Saar (today part of Völklingen), but neither could be returned to working order after being dismantled, moved and reassembled. On 7 December 1835, the &quot;Adler&quot; ran for the first time between Nuremberg and Fürth on the Bavarian Ludwig Railway. It was the 118th engine from the locomotive works of Robert Stephenson and stood under patent protection.
In Russia, the first steam locomotive was built in 1834 by Cherepanovs, however, it suffered from the lack of coal in the area and was replaced with horse traction after all the woods nearby had been cut down. The first Russian Tsarskoye Selo steam railway started in 1837 with locomotives purchased from Robert Stephenson and Company.

In 1837, the first steam railway started in Austria on the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway between Vienna-Floridsdorf and Deutsch-Wagram. The oldest continually working steam engine in the world also runs in Austria: the GKB 671 built in 1860, has never been taken out of service, and is still used for special excursions.

In 1838, the third steam locomotive to be built in Germany, the &quot;Saxonia&quot;, was manufactured by the &quot;Maschinenbaufirma Übigau&quot; near Dresden, built by Prof. Johann Andreas Schubert. The first independently designed locomotive in Germany was the &quot;Beuth&quot;, built by August Borsig in 1841. The first locomotive produced by Henschel-Werke in Kassel, the &quot;Drache&quot;, was delivered in 1848.

The first steam locomotives operating in Italy were the &quot;Bayard&quot; and the &quot;Vesuvio&quot;, running on the Napoli-Portici line, in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

The first railway line over Swiss territory was the Strasbourg–Basel line opened in 1844. Three years later, in 1847, the first fully Swiss railway line, the &quot;Spanisch Brötli Bahn&quot;, from Zürich to Baden was opened.

===Australia===
The arid nature of south Australia posed distinctive challenges to their early steam locomotion network. The high concentration of magnesium chloride in the well water (bore water) used in locomotive boilers on the Trans-Australian Railway caused serious and expensive maintenance problems. At no point along its route does the line cross a permanent freshwater watercourse, so bore water had to be relied on. No inexpensive treatment for the highly mineralised water was available, and locomotive boilers were lasting less than a quarter of the time normally expected. In the days of steam locomotion, about half the total train load was water for the engine. The line&#x27;s operator, Commonwealth Railways, was an early adopter of the diesel-electric locomotive.

==Components==

===Boiler===

The fire-tube boiler was standard practice for steam locomotive. Although other types of boiler were evaluated they were not widely used, except for some 1,000 locomotives in Hungary which used the water-tube Brotan boiler.
A boiler consists of a firebox where the fuel is burned, a barrel where water is turned into steam, and a smokebox which is kept at a slightly lower pressure than outside the firebox.

Solid fuel, such as wood, coal or coke, is thrown into the firebox through a door by a fireman, onto a set of grates which hold the fuel in a bed as it burns. Ash falls through the grate into an ashpan. If oil is used as the fuel, a door is needed for adjusting the air flow, maintaining the firebox, and cleaning the oil jets.

The fire-tube boiler has internal tubes connecting the firebox to the smokebox through which the combustion gases flow transferring heat to the water. All the tubes together provide a large contact area, called the tube heating surface, between the gas and water in the boiler. Boiler water surrounds the firebox to stop the metal from becoming too hot. This is another area where the gas transfers heat to the water and is called the firebox heating surface. Ash and char collect in the smokebox as the gas gets drawn up the chimney (&quot;stack&quot; or &quot;smokestack&quot; in the US) by the exhaust steam from the cylinders.

The pressure in the boiler has to be monitored using a steam gauge mounted in the cab. Steam pressure can be released manually by the driver or fireman. If the pressure reaches the boiler&#x27;s design working limit, a safety valve opens automatically to reduce the pressure and avoid a catastrophic accident.
The exhaust steam from the engine cylinders shoots out of a nozzle pointing up the chimney in the smokebox. The steam entrains or drags the smokebox gases with it which maintains a lower pressure in the smokebox than that under the firebox grate. This pressure difference causes air to flow up through the coal bed and keeps the fire burning.

The search for thermal efficiency greater than that of a typical fire-tube boiler led engineers, such as Nigel Gresley, to consider the water-tube boiler. Although he tested the concept on the LNER Class W1, the difficulties during development exceeded the will to increase efficiency by that route.

The steam generated in the boiler not only moves the locomotive, but is also used to operate other devices such as the whistle, the air compressor for the brakes, the pump for replenishing the water in the boiler and the passenger car heating system. The constant demand for steam requires a periodic replacement of water in the boiler. The water is kept in a tank in the locomotive tender or wrapped around the boiler in the case of a tank locomotive. Periodic stops are required to refill the tanks; an alternative was a scoop installed under the tender that collected water as the train passed over a track pan located between the rails.

While the locomotive is producing steam, the amount of water in the boiler is constantly monitored by looking at the water level in a transparent tube, or sight glass. Efficient and safe operation of the boiler requires keeping the level in between lines marked on the sight glass. If the water level is too high, steam production falls, efficiency is lost and water is carried out with the steam into the cylinders, possibly causing mechanical damage. More seriously, if the water level gets too low, the crown sheet (top sheet) of the firebox becomes exposed. Without water on top of the sheet to transfer away the heat of combustion, it softens and fails, letting high-pressure steam into the firebox and the cab. The development of the fusible plug, a temperature-sensitive device, ensured a controlled venting of steam into the firebox to warn the fireman to add water.

Scale builds up in the boiler and prevents adequate heat transfer, and corrosion eventually degrades the boiler materials to the point where it needs to be rebuilt or replaced. Start-up on a large engine may take hours of preliminary heating of the boiler water before sufficient steam is available.

Although the boiler is typically placed horizontally, for locomotives designed to work in locations with steep slopes it may be more appropriate to consider a vertical boiler or one mounted such that the boiler remains horizontal but the wheels are inclined to suit the slope of the rails.

===Steam circuit===

The steam generated in the boiler fills the space above the water in the partially filled boiler. Its maximum working pressure is limited by spring-loaded safety valves. It is then collected either in a perforated tube fitted above the water level or by a dome that often houses the regulator valve, or throttle, the purpose of which is to control the amount of steam leaving the boiler. The steam then either travels directly along and down a steam pipe to the engine unit or may first pass into the wet header of a superheater, the role of the latter being to improve thermal efficiency and eliminate water droplets suspended in the &quot;saturated steam&quot;, the state in which it leaves the boiler. On leaving the superheater, the steam exits the dry header of the superheater and passes down a steam pipe, entering the steam chests adjacent to the cylinders of a reciprocating engine. Inside each steam chest is a sliding valve that distributes the steam via ports that connect the steam chest to the ends of the cylinder space. The role of the valves is twofold: admission of each fresh dose of steam, and exhaust of the used steam once it has done its work.

The cylinders are double-acting, with steam admitted to each side of the piston in turn. In a two-cylinder locomotive, one cylinder is located on each side of the vehicle. The cranks are set 90° out of phase. During a full rotation of the driving wheel, steam provides four power strokes; each cylinder receives two injections of steam per revolution. The first stroke is to the front of the piston and the second stroke to the rear of the piston; hence two working strokes. Consequently, two deliveries of steam onto each piston face in the two cylinders generates a full revolution of the driving wheel. Each piston is attached to the driving axle on each side by a connecting rod, and the driving wheels are connected together by coupling rods to transmit power from the main driver to the other wheels. Note that at the two &quot;dead centres&quot;, when the connecting rod is on the same axis as the crankpin on the driving wheel, the connecting rod applies no torque to the wheel. Therefore, if both cranksets could be at &quot;dead centre&quot; at the same time, and the wheels should happen to stop in this position, the locomotive could not start moving. Therefore, the crankpins are attached to the wheels at a 90° angle to each other, so only one side can be at dead centre at a time.

Each piston transmits power through a crosshead, connecting rod (&quot;Main rod&quot; in the US) and a crankpin on the driving wheel (&quot;Main driver&quot; in the US) or to a crank on a driving axle. The movement of the valves in the steam chest is controlled through a set of rods and linkages called the valve gear, actuated from the driving axle or from the crankpin; the valve gear includes devices that allow reversing the engine, adjusting valve travel and the timing of the admission and exhaust events. The cut-off point determines the moment when the valve blocks a steam port, &quot;cutting off&quot; admission steam and thus determining the proportion of the stroke during which steam is admitted into the cylinder; for example a 50% cut-off admits steam for half the stroke of the piston. The remainder of the stroke is driven by the expansive force of the steam. Careful use of cut-off provides economical use of steam and in turn, reduces fuel and water consumption. The reversing lever (&quot;Johnson bar&quot; in the US), or screw-reverser (if so equipped), that controls the cut-off, therefore, performs a similar function to a gearshift in an automobile – maximum cut-off, providing maximum tractive effort at the expense of efficiency, is used to pull away from a standing start, whilst a cut-off as low as 10% is used when cruising, providing reduced tractive effort, and therefore lower fuel/water consumption.

Exhaust steam is directed upwards out of the locomotive through the chimney, by way of a nozzle called a blastpipe, creating the familiar &quot;chuffing&quot; sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that is at the same time traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, strictly speaking, the &quot;ejector&quot;) require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and often ignored by others, sometimes with catastrophic consequences). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, a strong draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter-effect of exerting &quot;back pressure&quot; on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector became a specific science, with engineers such as Chapelon, Giesl and Porta making large improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time and pollution. A similar system was used by some early gasoline/kerosene tractor manufacturers (Advance-Rumely/Hart-Parr) – the exhaust gas volume was vented through a cooling tower, allowing the steam exhaust to draw more air past the radiator.

===Running gear===


Running gear includes the brake gear, wheel sets, axleboxes, springing and the motion that includes connecting rods and valve gear. The transmission of the power from the pistons to the rails and the behaviour of the locomotive as a vehicle, being able to negotiate curves, points and irregularities in the track, is of paramount importance. Because reciprocating power has to be directly applied to the rail from 0 rpm upwards, this creates the problem of adhesion of the driving wheels to the smooth rail surface. Adhesive weight is the portion of the locomotive&#x27;s weight bearing on the driving wheels. This is made more effective if a pair of driving wheels is able to make the most of its axle load, i.e. its individual share of the adhesive weight. Equalising beams connecting the ends of leaf springs have often been deemed a complication in Britain, however, locomotives fitted with the beams have usually been less prone to loss of traction due to wheel-slip. Suspension using equalizing levers between driving axles, and between driving axles and trucks, was standard practice on North American locomotives to maintain even wheel loads when operating on uneven track.

Locomotives with total adhesion, where all of the wheels are coupled together, generally lack stability at speed. To counter this, locomotives often fit unpowered carrying wheels mounted on two-wheeled trucks or four-wheeled bogies centred by springs/inverted rockers/geared rollers that help to guide the locomotive through curves. These usually take on weight – of the cylinders at the front or the firebox at the rear – when the width exceeds that of the mainframes. Locomotives with multiple coupled-wheels on a rigid chassis would have unacceptable flange forces on tight curves giving excessive flange and rail wear, track spreading and wheel climb derailments. One solution was to remove or thin the flanges on an axle. More common was to give axles end-play and use lateral motion control with spring or inclined-plane gravity devices.

Railroads generally preferred locomotives with fewer axles, to reduce maintenance costs. The number of axles required was dictated by the maximum axle loading of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add axles until the maximum weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad&#x27;s maximum axle loading. A locomotive with a wheel arrangement of two lead axles, two drive axles, and one trailing axle was a high-speed machine. Two lead axles were necessary to have good tracking at high speeds. Two drive axles had a lower reciprocating mass than three, four, five or six coupled axles. They were thus able to turn at very high speeds due to the lower reciprocating mass. A trailing axle was able to support a huge firebox, hence most locomotives with the wheel arrangement of (American Type Atlantic) were called free steamers and were able to maintain steam pressure regardless of throttle setting.

===Chassis===
The chassis, or locomotive frame, is the principal structure onto which the boiler is mounted and which incorporates the various elements of the running gear. The boiler is rigidly mounted on a &quot;saddle&quot; beneath the smokebox and in front of the boiler barrel, but the firebox at the rear is allowed to slide forward and backwards, to allow for expansion when hot.

European locomotives usually use &quot;plate frames&quot;, where two vertical flat plates form the main chassis, with a variety of spacers and a buffer beam at each end to form a rigid structure. When inside cylinders are mounted between the frames, the plate frames are a single large casting that forms a major support element. The axleboxes slide up and down to give some sprung suspension, against thickened webs attached to the frame, called &quot;hornblocks&quot;.

American practice for many years was to use built-up bar frames, with the smokebox saddle/cylinder structure and drag beam integrated therein. In the 1920s, with the introduction of &quot;superpower&quot;, the cast-steel locomotive bed became the norm, incorporating frames, spring hangers, motion brackets, smokebox saddle and cylinder blocks into a single complex, sturdy but heavy casting. A SNCF design study using welded tubular frames gave a rigid frame with a 30% weight reduction.

===Fuel and water===
Generally, the largest locomotives are permanently coupled to a tender that carries the water and fuel. Often, locomotives working shorter distances do not have a tender and carry the fuel in a bunker, with the water carried in tanks placed next to the boiler. The tanks can be in various configurations, including two tanks alongside (side tanks or pannier tanks), one on top (saddle tank) or one between the frames (well tank).

The fuel used depended on what was economically available to the railway. In the UK and other parts of Europe, plentiful supplies of coal made this the obvious choice from the earliest days of the steam engine. Until 1870, the majority of locomotives in the United States burned wood, but as the Eastern forests were cleared, coal gradually became more widely used until it became the dominant fuel worldwide in steam locomotives. Railways serving sugar cane farming operations burned bagasse, a byproduct of sugar refining. In the US, the ready availability and low price of oil made it a popular steam locomotive fuel after 1900 for the southwestern railroads, particularly the Southern Pacific. In the Australian state of Victoria, many steam locomotives were converted to heavy oil firing after World War II. German, Russian, Australian and British railways experimented with using coal dust to fire locomotives.

During World War 2, a number of Swiss steam shunting locomotives were modified to use electrically heated boilers, consuming around 480 kW of power collected from an overhead line with a pantograph. These locomotives were significantly less efficient than electric ones; they were used because Switzerland was suffering a coal shortage because of the War, but had access to plentiful hydroelectricity.

A number of tourist lines and heritage locomotives in Switzerland, Argentina and Australia have used light diesel-type oil.

Water was supplied at stopping places and locomotive depots from a dedicated water tower connected to water cranes or gantries. In the UK, the US and France, water troughs (&quot;track pans&quot; in the US) were provided on some main lines to allow locomotives to replenish their water supply without stopping, from rainwater or snowmelt that filled the trough due to inclement weather. This was achieved by using a deployable &quot;water scoop&quot; fitted under the tender or the rear water tank in the case of a large tank engine; the fireman remotely lowered the scoop into the trough, the speed of the engine forced the water up into the tank, and the scoop was raised again once it was full.

Water is essential for the operation of a steam locomotive. As Swengel argued:

Swengel went on to note that &quot;at low temperature and relatively low boiler outputs&quot;, good water and regular boiler washout was an acceptable practice, even though such maintenance was high. As steam pressures increased, however, a problem of &quot;foaming&quot; or &quot;priming&quot; developed in the boiler, wherein dissolved solids in the water formed &quot;tough-skinned bubbles&quot; inside the boiler, which in turn were carried into the steam pipes and could blow off the cylinder heads. To overcome the problem, hot mineral-concentrated water was deliberately wasted (blown down) from the boiler periodically. Higher steam pressures required more blowing-down of water out of the boiler. Oxygen generated by boiling water attacks the boiler, and with increased steam pressure the rate of rust (iron oxide) generated inside the boiler increases. One way to help overcome the problem was water treatment. Swengel suggested that these problems contributed to the interest in electrification of railways.

In the 1970s, L.D. Porta developed a sophisticated system of heavy-duty chemical water treatment (Porta Treatment) that not only keeps the inside of the boiler clean and prevents corrosion, but modifies the foam in such a way as to form a compact &quot;blanket&quot; on the water surface that filters the steam as it is produced, keeping it pure and preventing carry-over into the cylinders of water and suspended abrasive matter.

Some steam locomotives have been run on alternative fuels such as used cooking oil like Grand Canyon Railway 4960, Grand Canyon Railway 29, U.S. Sugar 148, and the Disneyland Railroad Locomotives.

===Crew===
A steam locomotive is normally controlled from the boiler&#x27;s backhead, and the crew is usually protected from the elements by a cab. A crew of at least two people is normally required to operate a steam locomotive. One, the train driver or engineer (North America), is responsible for controlling the locomotive&#x27;s starting, stopping, and speed, and the fireman is responsible for maintaining the fire, regulating steam pressure and monitoring boiler and tender water levels. Due to the historical loss of operational infrastructure and staffing, preserved steam locomotives operating on the mainline will often have a support crew travelling with the train.

==Fittings and appliances==
All locomotives are fitted with a variety of appliances. Some of these relate directly to the operation of the steam engine; others are for signalling, train control or other purposes. In the United States, the Federal Railroad Administration mandated the use of certain appliances over the years in response to safety concerns. The most typical appliances are as follows:
===Steam pumps and injectors===
Water (feedwater) must be delivered to the boiler to replace that which is exhausted as steam after delivering a working stroke to the pistons. As the boiler is under pressure during operation, feedwater must be forced into the boiler at a pressure that is greater than the steam pressure, necessitating the use of some sort of pump. Hand-operated pumps sufficed for the very earliest locomotives. Later engines used pumps driven by the motion of the pistons (axle pumps), which were simple to operate, reliable and could handle large quantities of water but only operated when the locomotive was moving and could overload the valve gear and piston rods at high speeds. Steam injectors later replaced the pump, while some engines transitioned to turbopumps. Standard practice evolved to use two independent systems for feeding water to the boiler; either two steam injectors or, on more conservative designs, axle pumps when running at service speed and a steam injector for filling the boiler when stationary or at low speeds. By the 20th century virtually all new-built locomotives used only steam injectors – often one injector was supplied with &quot;live&quot; steam straight from the boiler itself and the other used exhaust steam from the locomotive&#x27;s cylinders, which was more efficient (since it made use of otherwise wasted steam) but could only be used when the locomotive was in motion and the regulator was open. Injectors became unreliable if the feedwater was at a high temperature, so locomotives with feedwater heaters, tank locomotives with the tanks in contact with the boiler and condensing locomotives sometimes used reciprocating steam pumps or turbopumps.

Vertical glass tubes, known as water gauges or water glasses, show the level of water in the boiler and are carefully monitored at all times while the boiler is being fired. Before the 1870s it was more common to have a series of try-cocks fitted to the boiler within reach of the crew; each try cock (at least two and usually three were fitted) was mounted at a different level. By opening each try-cock and seeing if steam or water vented through it, the level of water in the boiler could be estimated with limited accuracy. As boiler pressures increased the use of try-cocks became increasingly dangerous and the valves were prone to blockage with scale or sediment, giving false readings. This led to their replacement with the sight glass. As with the injectors, two glasses with separate fittings were usually installed to provide independent readings.

===Boiler insulation===

The term for pipe and boiler insulation is &quot;lagging&quot; which derives from the cooper&#x27;s term for a wooden barrel stave. Two of the earliest steam locomotives used wooden lagging to insulate their boilers: the Salamanca, the first commercially successful steam locomotive, built in 1812, and the Locomotion No. 1, the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line. Large amounts of heat are wasted if a boiler is not insulated. Early locomotives used lags, shaped wooden staves, fitted lengthways along the boiler barrel, and held in place by hoops, metal bands, the terms and methods are from cooperage.
Improved insulating methods included applying a thick paste containing a porous mineral such as kieselgur, or attaching shaped blocks of insulating compound such as magnesia blocks. In the latter days of steam, &quot;mattresses&quot; of stitched asbestos cloth stuffed with asbestos fibre were fixed to the boiler, on separators so as not quite to touch the boiler. However, asbestos is currently banned in most countries for health reasons. The most common modern-day material is glass wool, or wrappings of aluminium foil.

The lagging is protected by a close-fitted sheet-metal casing known as boiler clothing or cleading.

Effective lagging is particularly important for fireless locomotives; however, in recent times under the influence of L.D. Porta, &quot;exaggerated&quot; insulation has been practised for all types of locomotive on all surfaces liable to dissipate heat, such as cylinder ends and facings between the cylinders and the mainframes. This considerably reduces engine warmup time with a marked increase in overall efficiency.

===Safety valves===

Early locomotives were fitted with a valve controlled by a weight suspended from the end of a lever, with the steam outlet being stopped by a cone-shaped valve. As there was nothing to prevent the weighted lever from bouncing when the locomotive ran over irregularities in the track, thus wasting steam, the weight was later replaced by a more stable spring-loaded column, often supplied by Salter, a well-known spring scale manufacturer. The danger of these devices was that the driving crew could be tempted to add weight to the arm to increase pressure. Most early boilers were fitted with a tamper-proof &quot;lockup&quot; direct-loaded ball valve protected by a cowl. In the late 1850s, John Ramsbottom introduced a safety valve that became popular in Britain during the latter part of the 19th century. Not only was this valve tamper-proof, but tampering by the driver could only have the effect of easing pressure. George Richardson&#x27;s safety valve was an American invention introduced in 1875, and was designed to release the steam only at the moment when the pressure attained the maximum permitted. This type of valve is in almost universal use at present. Britain&#x27;s Great Western Railway was a notable exception to this rule, retaining the direct-loaded type until the end of its separate existence, because it was considered that such a valve lost less pressure between opening and closing.

===Pressure gauge===

The earliest locomotives did not show the pressure of steam in the boiler, but it was possible to estimate this by the position of the safety valve arm which often extended onto the firebox back plate; gradations marked on the spring column gave a rough indication of the actual pressure. The promoters of the Rainhill trials urged that each contender have a proper mechanism for reading the boiler pressure, and Stephenson devised a nine-foot vertical tube of mercury with a sight-glass at the top, mounted alongside the chimney, for his &quot;Rocket&quot;. The Bourdon tube gauge, in which the pressure straightens an oval-section coiled tube of brass or bronze connected to a pointer, was introduced in 1849 and quickly gained acceptance, and is still used today. Some locomotives have an additional pressure gauge in the steam chest. This helps the driver avoid wheel-slip at startup, by warning if the regulator opening is too great.

===Spark arrestors and smokeboxes===
;Spark arrestor and self-cleaning smokebox
Wood-burners emit large quantities of flying sparks which necessitate an efficient spark-arresting device generally housed in the smokestack. Many different types were fitted, the most common early type being the Bonnet stack that incorporated a cone-shaped deflector placed before the mouth of the chimney pipe, and a wire screen covering the wide stack exit. A more efficient design was the Radley and Hunter centrifugal stack patented in 1850 (commonly known as the diamond stack), incorporating baffles so oriented as to induce a swirl effect in the chamber that encouraged the embers to burn out and fall to the bottom as ash. In the self-cleaning smokebox the opposite effect was achieved: by allowing the flue gasses to strike a series of deflector plates, angled in such a way that the blast was not impaired, the larger particles were broken into small pieces that would be ejected with the blast, rather than settle in the bottom of the smokebox to be removed by hand at the end of the run. As with the arrestor, a screen was incorporated to retain any large embers.

Locomotives of the British Railways standard classes fitted with self-cleaning smokeboxes were identified by a small cast oval plate marked &quot;S.C.&quot;, fitted at the bottom of the smokebox door. These engines required different disposal procedures and the plate highlighted this need to depot staff.

===Stokers===
A factor that limits locomotive performance is the rate at which fuel is fed into the fire. In the early 20th century some locomotives became so large that the fireman could not shovel coal fast enough. In the United States, various steam-powered mechanical stokers became standard equipment and were adopted and used elsewhere including Australia and South Africa.

===Feedwater heating===
Introducing cold water into a boiler reduces power, and from the 1920s a variety of heaters were incorporated. The most common type for locomotives was the exhaust steam feedwater heater that piped some of the exhaust through small tanks mounted on top of the boiler or smokebox or into the tender tank; the warm water then had to be delivered to the boiler by a small auxiliary steam pump. The rare economiser type differed in that it extracted residual heat from the exhaust gases. An example of this is the pre-heater drum(s) found on the Franco-Crosti boiler.

The use of live steam and exhaust steam injectors also assists in the pre-heating of boiler feedwater to a small degree, though there is no efficiency advantage to live steam injectors. Such pre-heating also reduces the thermal shock that a boiler might experience when cold water is introduced directly. This is further helped by the top feed, where water is introduced to the highest part of the boiler and made to trickle over a series of trays. George Jackson Churchward fitted this arrangement to the high end of his domeless coned boilers. Other British lines such as the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway fitted some locomotives with the top feed inside a separate dome forward of the main one.

===Condensers and water re-supply===

Steam locomotives consume vast quantities of water because they operate on an open cycle, expelling their steam immediately after a single use rather than recycling it in a closed loop as stationary and marine steam engines do. Water was a constant logistical problem, and condensing engines were devised for use in desert areas. These engines had huge radiators in their tenders and instead of exhausting steam out of the funnel it was captured, passed back to the tender and condensed. The cylinder lubricating oil was removed from the exhausted steam to avoid a phenomenon known as priming, a condition caused by foaming in the boiler which would allow water to be carried into the cylinders causing damage because of its incompressibility. The most notable engines employing condensers (Class 25, the &quot;puffers which never puff&quot;) worked across the Karoo desert of South Africa from the 1950s until the 1980s.

Some British and American locomotives were equipped with scoops which collected water from &quot;water troughs&quot; (&quot;track pans&quot; in the US) while in motion, thus avoiding stops for water. In the US, small communities often did not have refilling facilities. During the early days of railroading, the crew simply stopped next to a stream and filled the tender using leather buckets. This was known as &quot;jerking water&quot; and led to the term &quot;jerkwater towns&quot; (meaning a small town, a term which today is considered derisive). In Australia and South Africa, locomotives in drier regions operated with large oversized tenders and some even had an additional water wagon, sometimes called a &quot;canteen&quot; or in Australia (particularly in New South Wales) a &quot;water gin&quot;.

Steam locomotives working on underground railways (such as London&#x27;s Metropolitan Railway) were fitted with condensing apparatus to prevent steam from escaping into the railway tunnels. These were still being used between King&#x27;s Cross and Moorgate into the early 1960s.

===Braking===

Steam locomotives usually have their own braking system, independent from the rest of the train. Locomotive brakes employ large shoes which press against the driving wheel treads. They can be either air brakes or steam brakes. In addition, they nearly always have a handbrake to keep the locomotive stationary when there is no steam pressure to power the other braking systems.

Because of the limited braking force provided by locomotive-only brakes, many steam locomotives were fitted with a train brake. These came in two main varieties; air brakes and vacuum brakes. These allowed the driver to control the brakes on all cars in the train.

Air brakes, invented by George Westinghouse, use a steam-driven air compressor mounted on the side of the boiler to create the compressed air needed to power the brake system. Air brakes were the predominant form of train braking in most countries during the steam era.

The primary competitor to the air brake was the vacuum brake, in which a steam-operated ejector is mounted on the engine instead of the air pump, to create the vacuum required to power the brake system. A secondary ejector or crosshead vacuum pump is used to maintain the vacuum in the system against the small leaks in the pipe connections between carriages and wagons. Vacuum brakes were the predominant form of train braking in the United Kingdom and countries that adopted its practices, such as India and South Africa, during the steam era.

Steam locomotives are fitted with sandboxes from which sand can be deposited on top of the rail to improve traction and braking in wet or icy weather. On American locomotives, the sandboxes, or sand domes, are usually mounted on top of the boiler. In Britain, the limited loading gauge precludes this, so the sandboxes are mounted just above, or just below, the running plate.

===Lubrication===

The pistons and valves on the earliest locomotives were lubricated by the enginemen dropping a lump of tallow down the blast pipe. More sophisticated methods of delivering the substance were soon developed. Tallow adheres well to cylinder walls and is more effective than mineral oil in resisting the action of water. It remains a constituent of modern steam cylinder oil formulation.

As speeds and distances increased, mechanisms were developed that injected thick mineral oil into the steam supply. The first, a displacement lubricator, mounted in the cab, uses a controlled stream of steam condensing into a sealed container of oil. Water from the condensed steam displaces the oil into pipes. The apparatus is usually fitted with sight-glasses to confirm the rate of supply. A later method uses a mechanical pump worked from one of the crossheads. In both cases, the supply of oil is proportional to the speed of the locomotive.

Lubricating the frame components (axle bearings, horn blocks and bogie pivots) depends on capillary action: trimmings of worsted yarn are trailed from oil reservoirs into pipes leading to the respective component. The rate of oil supplied is controlled by the size of the bundle of yarn and not the speed of the locomotive, so it is necessary to remove the trimmings (which are mounted on wire) when stationary. However, at regular stops (such as a terminating station platform), oil finding its way onto the track can still be a problem.

Crankpin and crosshead bearings carry small cup-shaped reservoirs for oil. These have feed pipes to the bearing surface that start above the normal fill level, or are kept closed by a loose-fitting pin, so that only when the locomotive is in motion does oil enter. In United Kingdom practice, the cups are closed with simple corks, but these have a piece of porous cane pushed through them to admit air. It is customary for a small capsule of pungent oil (aniseed or garlic) to be incorporated in the bearing metal to warn if the lubrication fails and excess heating or wear occurs.

===Blower===
When the locomotive is running under power, a draught on the fire is created by the exhaust steam directed up the chimney by the blastpipe. Without draught, the fire will quickly die down and steam pressure will fall. When the locomotive is stopped, or coasting with the regulator closed, there is no exhaust steam to create a draught, so the draught is maintained by means of a blower. This is a ring placed either around the base of the chimney, or around the blast pipe orifice, containing several small steam nozzles directed up the chimney. These nozzles are fed with steam directly from the boiler, controlled by the blower valve. When the regulator is open, the blower valve is closed; when the driver intends to close the regulator, he will first open the blower valve. It is important that the blower be opened before the regulator is closed, since without draught on the fire, there may be backdraught – where atmospheric air blows down the chimney, causing the flow of hot gases through the boiler tubes to be reversed, with the fire itself being blown through the firehole onto the footplate, with serious consequences for the crew. The risk of backdraught is higher when the locomotive enters a tunnel because of the pressure shock. The blower is also used to create draught when steam is being raised at the start of the locomotive&#x27;s duty, at any time when the driver needs to increase the draught on the fire, and to clear smoke from the driver&#x27;s line of vision.

Blowbacks were fairly common. In a 1955 report on an accident near Dunstable, the Inspector wrote, &quot;In 1953 twenty-three cases, which were not caused by an engine defect, were reported and they resulted in 26 enginemen receiving injuries. In 1954, the number of occurrences and of injuries were the same and there was also one fatal casualty.&quot; They remain a problem, as evidenced by the 2012 incident with BR Standard Class 7 70013 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;.

===Buffers===

In British and European (except former Soviet Union countries) practice, locomotives usually have buffers at each end to absorb compressive loads (&quot;buffets&quot;). The tensional load of drawing the train (draft force) is carried by the coupling system. Together these control slack between the locomotive and train, absorb minor impacts and provide a bearing point for pushing movements.

In Canadian and American practice, all of the forces between the locomotive and cars are handled through the coupler – particularly the Janney coupler, long standard on American railroad rolling stock – and its associated draft gear, which allows some limited slack movement. Small dimples called &quot;poling pockets&quot; at the front and rear corners of the locomotive allowed cars to be pushed onto an adjacent track using a pole braced between the locomotive and the cars. In Britain and Europe, North American style &quot;buckeye&quot; and other couplers that handle forces between items of rolling stock have become increasingly popular.

===Pilots===
A pilot was usually fixed to the front end of locomotives, although in European and a few other railway systems including New South Wales, they were considered unnecessary. Plough-shaped, sometimes called &quot;cow catchers&quot;, they were quite large and were designed to remove obstacles from the track such as cattle, bison, other animals or tree limbs. Though unable to &quot;catch&quot; stray cattle, these distinctive items remained on locomotives until the end of steam. Switching engines usually replaced the pilot with small steps, known as &quot;footboards&quot;. Many systems used the pilot and other design features to produce a distinctive appearance.

===Headlights===
When night operations began, railway companies in some countries equipped their locomotives with lights to allow the driver to see what lay ahead of the train, or to enable others to see the locomotive. Headlights were originally oil or acetylene lamps, but when electric arc lamps became available in the late 1880s, they quickly replaced the older types.

Britain did not adopt bright headlights as they would affect night vision and so could mask the low-intensity oil lamps used in the semaphore signals and at each end of trains, increasing the danger of missing signals, especially on busy tracks. Locomotive stopping distances were also normally much greater than the range of headlights, and the railways were well-signalled and fully fenced to prevent livestock and people from straying onto them, largely negating the need for bright lamps. Thus low-intensity oil lamps continued to be used, positioned on the front of locomotives to indicate the class of each train. Four &quot;lamp irons&quot; (brackets on which to place the lamps) were provided: one below the chimney and three evenly spaced across the top of the buffer beam. The exception to this was the Southern Railway and its constituents, who added an extra lamp iron each side of the smokebox, and the arrangement of lamps (or in daylight, white circular plates) told railway staff the origin and destination of the train. On all vehicles, equivalent lamp irons were also provided on the rear of the locomotive or tender for when the locomotive was running tender- or bunker-first.

In some countries, heritage steam operation continues on the national network. Some railway authorities have mandated powerful headlights on at all times, including during daylight. This was to further inform the public or track workers of any active trains.

===Bells and whistles===

Locomotives used bells and steam whistles from earliest days of steam locomotion. In the United States, India and Canada, bells warned of a train in motion. In Britain, where all lines are by law fenced throughout, bells were only a requirement on railways running on a road (i.e. not fenced off), for example a tramway along the side of the road or in a dockyard. Consequently, only a minority of locomotives in the UK carried bells. Whistles are used to signal personnel and give warnings. Depending on the terrain the locomotive was being used in, the whistle could be designed for long-distance warning of impending arrival, or for more localised use.

Early bells and whistles were sounded through pull-string cords and levers. Automatic bell ringers came into widespread use in the US after 1910.

===Automatic control===
From the early 20th century operating companies in such countries as Germany and Britain began to fit locomotives with Automatic Warning System (AWS) in-cab signalling, which automatically applied the brakes when a signal was passed at &quot;caution&quot;. In Britain, these became mandatory in 1956. In the United States, the Pennsylvania Railroad also fitted their locomotives with such devices.

===Booster engines===
The booster engine was an auxiliary steam engine which provided extra tractive effort for starting. It was a low-speed device, usually mounted on the trailing truck. It was disengaged via an idler gear at a low speed, e.g. 30 km/h. Boosters were widely used in the US and tried experimentally in Britain and France. On the narrow-gauged New Zealand railway system, six Kb 4-8-4 locomotives were fitted with boosters, the only gauge engines in the world to have such equipment.

Booster engines were also fitted to tender trucks in the US and known as auxiliary locomotives. Two and even three truck axles were connected together using side rods which limited them to slow-speed service.

=== Firedoor ===
The firedoor is used to cover the firehole when coal is not being added. It serves two purposes, first, it prevents air being drawn over the top of the fire, rather forcing it to be drawn through it. The second purpose is to safeguard the train crew against blowbacks. It does, however, have a means to allow some air to pass over the top of the fire (referred to as &quot;secondary air&quot;) to complete the combustion of gases produced by the fire.

Firedoors come in multiple designs, the most basic of which is a single piece which is hinged on one side and can swing open onto the footplate. This design has two issues. First, it takes up much room on the footplate, and second, the draught will tend to pull it completely shut, thus cutting off any secondary air. To compensate for this some locomotives are fitted with a latch that prevents the firedoor from closing completely whereas others have a small vent on the door that may be opened to allow secondary air to flow through. Though it was considered to design a firedoor that opens inwards into the firebox thus preventing the inconvenience caused on the footplate, such a door would be exposed to the full heat of the fire and would likely deform, thus becoming useless.

A more popular type of firedoor consists of a two-piece sliding door operated by a single lever. There are tracks above and below the firedoor which the door runs along. These tracks are prone to becoming jammed by debris and the doors required more effort to open than the aforementioned swinging door. In order to address this some firedoors use powered operation which utilized a steam or air cylinder to open the door. Among these are the butterfly doors which pivot at the upper corner, the pivoting action offers low resistance to the cylinder that opens the door.

==Variations==
Numerous variations on the basic locomotive occurred as railways attempted to improve efficiency and performance.

===Cylinders===

Early steam locomotives had two cylinders, one either side, and this practice persisted as the simplest arrangement. The cylinders could be mounted between the mainframes (known as &quot;inside&quot; cylinders), or mounted outside the frames and driving wheels (&quot;outside&quot; cylinders). Inside cylinders drive cranks built into the driving axle; outside cylinders drive cranks on extensions to the driving axles.

Later designs employed three or four cylinders, mounted both inside and outside the frames, for a more even power cycle and greater power output. This was at the expense of more complicated valve gear and increased maintenance requirements. In some cases the third cylinder was added inside simply to allow for smaller diameter outside cylinders, and hence reduce the width of the locomotive for use on lines with a restricted loading gauge, for example the SR K1 and U1 classes.

Most British express-passenger locomotives built between 1930 and 1950 were or types with three or four cylinders (e.g. GWR 6000 Class, LMS Coronation Class, SR Merchant Navy Class, LNER Gresley Class A3). From 1951, all but one of the 999 new British Rail standard class steam locomotives across all types used 2-cylinder configurations for easier maintenance.

===Valve gear===

Early locomotives used a simple valve gear that gave full power in either forward or reverse. Soon the Stephenson valve gear allowed the driver to control cut-off; this was largely superseded by Walschaerts valve gear and similar patterns. Early locomotive designs using slide valves and outside admission were relatively easy to construct, but inefficient and prone to wear. Eventually, slide valves were superseded by inside admission piston valves, though there were attempts to apply poppet valves (commonly used in stationary engines) in the 20th century. Stephenson valve gear was generally placed within the frame and was difficult to access for maintenance; later patterns applied outside the frame were more readily visible and maintained.

===Compounding===

Compound locomotives were used from 1876, expanding the steam twice or more through separate cylinders – reducing thermal losses caused by cylinder cooling. Compound locomotives were especially useful in trains where long periods of continuous efforts were needed. Compounding contributed to the dramatic increase in power achieved by André Chapelon&#x27;s rebuilds from 1929. A common application was in articulated locomotives, the most common being that designed by Anatole Mallet, in which the high-pressure stage was attached directly to the boiler frame; in front of this was pivoted a low-pressure engine on its own frame, which takes the exhaust from the rear engine.

===Articulated locomotives===

Very powerful locomotives tend to be longer than those with lower power output, but long rigid-framed designs are impracticable for the tight curves frequently found on narrow-gauge railways. Various designs for articulated locomotives were developed to overcome this problem. The Mallet and the Garratt were the two most popular. They had a single boiler and two engine units (sets of cylinders and driving wheels): both of the Garratt&#x27;s engine units were on swivelling frames, whereas one of the Mallet&#x27;s was on a swivelling frame and the other was fixed under the boiler unit. A few triplex locomotives were also designed, with a third engine unit under the tender. Other less common variations included the Fairlie locomotive, which had two boilers back-to-back on a common frame, with two separate engine units.

===Duplex types===

Duplex locomotives, containing two engines in one rigid frame, were also tried, but were not notably successful. For example, the Pennsylvania Railroad class T1, designed for very fast running, suffered recurring and ultimately unfixable slippage problems throughout their careers.

===Geared locomotives===

For locomotives where a high starting torque and low speed were required, the conventional direct drive approach was inadequate. &quot;Geared&quot; steam locomotives, such as the Shay, the Climax and the Heisler, were developed to meet this need on industrial, logging, mine and quarry railways. The common feature of these three types was the provision of reduction gearing and a drive shaft between the crankshaft and the driving axles. This arrangement allowed the engine to run at a much higher speed than the driving wheels compared to the conventional design, where the ratio is 1:1.

===Cab forward===
In the United States on the Southern Pacific Railroad, a series of cab forward locomotives were produced with the cab and the firebox at the front of the locomotive and the tender behind the smokebox, so that the engine appeared to run backwards. This was only possible by using oil-firing. Southern Pacific selected this design to provide air free of smoke for the engine driver to breathe as the locomotive passed through mountain tunnels and snow sheds. Another variation was the Camelback locomotive, with the cab situated halfway along the boiler. In England, Oliver Bulleid developed the SR Leader class locomotive during the nationalisation process in the late 1940s. The locomotive was heavily tested but several design faults (such as coal firing and sleeve valves) meant that this locomotive and the other part-built locomotives were scrapped. The cab-forward design was taken by Bulleid to Ireland, where he moved after nationalisation, where he developed the &quot;turfburner&quot;. This locomotive was more successful, but was scrapped due to the dieselisation of the Irish railways.

The only preserved cab forward locomotive is Southern Pacific 4294 in Sacramento, California.

In France, the three Heilmann locomotives were built with a cab forward design.

===Steam turbines===

Steam turbines were created as an attempt to improve the operation and efficiency of steam locomotives. Experiments with steam turbines using direct-drive and electrical transmissions in various countries proved mostly unsuccessful. The London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway built the Turbomotive, a largely successful attempt to prove the efficiency of steam turbines. Had it not been for the outbreak of World War II, more may have been built. The Turbomotive ran from 1935 to 1949, when it was rebuilt into a conventional locomotive because many parts required replacement, an uneconomical proposition for a &quot;one-off&quot; locomotive. In the United States, Union Pacific, Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and Norfolk &amp; Western (N&amp;W) railways all built turbine-electric locomotives. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) also built turbine locomotives, but with a direct-drive gearbox. However, all designs failed due to dust, vibration, design flaws or inefficiency at lower speeds. The final one remaining in service was the N&amp;W&#x27;s, retired in January 1958. The only truly successful design was the TGOJ MT3, used for hauling iron ore from Grängesberg in Sweden to the ports of Oxelösund. Despite functioning correctly, only three were built. Two of them are preserved in working order in museums in Sweden.

===Fireless locomotive===

In a fireless locomotive the boiler is replaced by a steam accumulator, which is charged with steam (actually water at a temperature well above boiling point, () from a stationary boiler. Fireless locomotives were used where there was a high fire risk (e.g. oil refineries), where cleanliness was important (e.g. food-production plants) or where steam is readily available (e.g. paper mills and power stations where steam is either a by-product or is cheaply available). The water vessel (&quot;boiler&quot;) is heavily insulated, the same as with a fired locomotive. Until all the water has boiled away, the steam pressure does not drop except as the temperature drops.

Another class of fireless locomotive is a compressed-air locomotive.

===Mixed power===

====Steam diesel hybrid locomotive====

Mixed power locomotives, utilising both steam and diesel propulsion, have been produced in Russia, Britain and Italy.

====Electric–steam locomotive====

Under unusual conditions (lack of coal, abundant hydroelectricity) some locomotives in Switzerland were modified to use electricity to heat the boiler, making them electric–steam locomotives.

====Steam-electric locomotive====

A steam-electric locomotive uses electric transmission, like diesel-electric locomotives, except that a steam engine instead of a diesel engine is used to drive a generator. Three such locomotives were built by the French engineer in the 1890s.

==Categorisation==
Steam locomotives are categorised by their wheel arrangement. The two dominant systems for this are the Whyte notation and UIC classification.

The Whyte notation, used in most English-speaking and Commonwealth countries, represents each set of wheels with a number. These numbers typically represented the number of unpowered leading wheels, followed by the number of driving wheels (sometimes in several groups), followed by the number of un-powered trailing wheels. For example, a yard engine with only 4 driven wheels, without any leading or trailing wheels, would be categorised as a wheel arrangement. A locomotive with a 4-wheel leading truck, followed by 6 drive wheels, and a 2-wheel trailing truck, would be classed as a . Different arrangements were given names which usually reflect the first usage of the arrangement; for instance, the &quot;Santa Fe&quot; type () is so called because the first examples were built for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. These names were informally given and varied according to region and even politics.

The UIC classification is used mostly in European countries apart from the United Kingdom. It designates consecutive pairs of wheels (informally &quot;axles&quot;) with a number for non-driving wheels and a capital letter for driving wheels (A=1, B=2, etc.) So a Whyte designation would be an equivalent to a 2-C-1 UIC designation.

On many railroads, locomotives were organised into classes. These broadly represented locomotives which could be substituted for each other in service, but most commonly a class represented a single design. As a rule classes were assigned some sort of code, generally based on the wheel arrangement. Classes also commonly acquired nicknames, such as &quot;Pug&quot; (a small shunting locomotive), representing notable (and sometimes uncomplimentary) features of the locomotives.

==Performance==

===Measurement===
In the steam locomotive era, two measures of locomotive performance were generally applied. At first, locomotives were rated by tractive effort, defined as the average force developed during one revolution of the driving wheels at the railhead. This can be roughly calculated by multiplying the total piston area by 85% of the boiler pressure (a rule of thumb reflecting the slightly lower pressure in the steam chest above the cylinder) and dividing by the ratio of the driver diameter over the piston stroke. However, the precise formula is

: formula_1

where is the bore of the cylinder (diameter) in inches,
 is the cylinder stroke, in inches,
 is boiler pressure in pounds per square inch,
 is the diameter of the driving wheel in inches,
and is a factor that depends on the effective cut-off. In the US, is usually set at 0.85, but lower on engines that have maximum cutoff limited to 50–75%.

The tractive effort is only the &quot;average&quot; force, as not all effort is constant during the one revolution of the drivers. At some points of the cycle, only one piston is exerting turning moment and at other points, both pistons are working. Not all boilers deliver full power at starting, and the tractive effort also decreases as the rotating speed increases.

Tractive effort is a measure of the heaviest load a locomotive can start or haul at very low speed over the ruling grade in a given territory. However, as the pressure grew to run faster goods and heavier passenger trains, tractive effort was seen to be an inadequate measure of performance because it did not take into account speed. Therefore, in the 20th century, locomotives began to be rated by power output. A variety of calculations and formulas were applied, but in general railways used dynamometer cars to measure tractive force at speed in actual road testing.

British railway companies have been reluctant to disclose figures for drawbar horsepower and have usually relied on continuous tractive effort instead.

===Relation to wheel arrangement===
Classification is indirectly connected to locomotive performance. Given adequate proportions of the rest of the locomotive, power output is determined by the size of the fire, and for a bituminous coal-fuelled locomotive, this is determined by the grate area. Modern non-compound locomotives are typically able to produce about 40 drawbar horsepower per square foot of grate. Tractive force, as noted earlier, is largely determined by the boiler pressure, the cylinder proportions and the size of the driving wheels. However, it is also limited by the weight on the driving wheels (termed &quot;adhesive weight&quot;), which needs to be at least four times the tractive effort.

The weight of the locomotive is roughly proportional to the power output; the number of axles required is determined by this weight divided by the axleload limit for the trackage where the locomotive is to be used. The number of driving wheels is derived from the adhesive weight in the same manner, leaving the remaining axles to be accounted for by the leading and trailing bogies. Passenger locomotives conventionally had two-axle leading bogies for better guidance at speed; on the other hand, the vast increase in the size of the grate and firebox in the 20th century meant that a trailing bogie was called upon to provide support. In Europe, some use was made of several variants of the &quot;Bissel bogie&quot; in which the swivelling movement of a single axle truck controls the lateral displacement of the front driving axle (and in one case the second axle too). This was mostly applied to 8-coupled express and mixed traffic locomotives, and considerably improved their ability to negotiate curves whilst restricting overall locomotive wheelbase and maximising adhesion weight.

As a rule, shunting engines (US: &quot;switching engines&quot;) omitted leading and trailing bogies, both to maximise tractive effort available and to reduce wheelbase. Speed was unimportant; making the smallest engine (and therefore smallest fuel consumption) for the tractive effort was paramount. Driving wheels were small and usually supported the firebox as well as the main section of the boiler. Banking engines (US: &quot;helper engines&quot;) tended to follow the principles of shunting engines, except that the wheelbase limitation did not apply, so banking engines tended to have more driving wheels. In the US, this process eventually resulted in the Mallet type engine with its many driven wheels, and these tended to acquire leading and then trailing bogies as guidance of the engine became more of an issue.

As locomotive types began to diverge in the late 19th century, freight engine designs at first emphasised tractive effort, whereas those for passenger engines emphasised speed. Over time, freight locomotive size increased, and the overall number of axles increased accordingly; the leading bogie was usually a single axle, but a trailing truck was added to larger locomotives to support a larger firebox that could no longer fit between or above the driving wheels. Passenger locomotives had leading bogies with two axles, fewer driving axles, and very large driving wheels in order to limit the speed at which the reciprocating parts had to move.

In the 1920s, the focus in the United States turned to horsepower, epitomised by the &quot;super power&quot; concept promoted by the Lima Locomotive Works, although tractive effort was still the prime consideration after World War I to the end of steam. Goods trains were designed to run faster, while passenger locomotives needed to pull heavier loads at speed. This was achieved by increasing the size of grate and firebox without changes to the rest of the locomotive, requiring the addition of a second axle to the trailing truck. Freight s became s while s became s. Similarly, passenger s became s. In the United States this led to a convergence on the dual-purpose and the articulated configuration, which was used for both freight and passenger service. Mallet locomotives went through a similar transformation, evolving from bank engines into huge mainline locomotives with much larger fireboxes; their driving wheels were also increased in size in order to allow faster running.

==Manufacture==
===Most-manufactured classes===

The most-manufactured single class of steam locomotive in the world is the Russian locomotive class E steam locomotive with around 11,000 produced both in Russia and other countries such as Czechoslovakia, Germany, Sweden, Hungary and Poland. The Russian locomotive class O numbered 9,129 locomotives, built between 1890 and 1928. Around 7,000 units were produced of the German DRB Class 52 Kriegslok.

In Britain, 863 of the GWR 5700 Class were built, and 943 of the DX class of the London and North Western Railway including 86 engines built for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.

===United Kingdom===
Before the 1923 Grouping Act, production in the UK was mixed. The larger railway companies built locomotives in their own workshops, with the smaller ones and industrial concerns ordering them from outside builders. A large market for outside builders existed due to the home-build policy exercised by the main railway companies. An example of a pre-grouping works was the one at Melton Constable, which maintained and built some of the locomotives for the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. Other works included one at Boston (an early GNR building) and Horwich Works.

Between 1923 and 1947, the Big Four railway companies (the Great Western Railway, the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway, the London &amp; North Eastern Railway and the Southern Railway) all built most of their own locomotives, only buying locomotives from outside builders when their own works were fully occupied (or as a result of government-mandated standardisation during wartime).

From 1948, British Railways (BR) allowed the former Big Four companies (now designated as &quot;Regions&quot;) to continue to produce their own designs, but also created a range of standard locomotives which supposedly combined the best features from each region. Although a policy of dieselisation was adopted in 1955, BR continued to build new steam locomotives until 1960, with the final engine being named &quot;Evening Star&quot;.

Some independent manufacturers produced steam locomotives for a few more years, with the last British-built industrial steam locomotive being constructed by Hunslet in 1971. Since then, a few specialised manufacturers have continued to produce small locomotives for narrow gauge and miniature railways, but as the prime market for these is the tourist and heritage railway sector, the demand for such locomotives is limited. In November 2008, a new build main line steam locomotive, 60163 &quot;Tornado&quot;, was tested on UK mainlines for eventual charter and tour use.

===Sweden===
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, most Swedish steam locomotives were manufactured in Britain. Later, however, most steam locomotives were built by local factories including NOHAB in Trollhättan and ASJ in Falun. One of the most successful types was the class &quot;B&quot; (), inspired by the Prussian class P8. Many of the Swedish steam locomotives were preserved during the Cold War in case of war. During the 1990s, these steam locomotives were sold to non-profit associations or abroad, which is why the Swedish class B, class S () and class E2 () locomotives can now be seen in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany and Canada.

===United States===
Locomotives for American railroads were nearly always built in the United States with very few imports, except in the earliest days of steam engines. This was due to the basic differences of markets in the United States which initially had many small markets located large distances apart, in contrast to Europe&#x27;s higher density of markets. Locomotives that were cheap and rugged and could go large distances over cheaply built and maintained tracks were required. Once the manufacture of engines was established on a wide scale there was very little advantage to buying an engine from overseas that would have to be customised to fit the local requirements and track conditions. Improvements in engine design of both European and US origin were incorporated by manufacturers when they could be justified in a generally very conservative and slow-changing market. With the notable exception of the USRA standard locomotives built during World War I, in the United States, steam locomotive manufacture was always semi-customised. Railroads ordered locomotives tailored to their specific requirements, though some basic design features were always present. Railroads developed some specific characteristics; for example, the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Great Northern Railway had a preference for the Belpaire firebox. In the United States, large-scale manufacturers constructed locomotives for nearly all rail companies, although nearly all major railroads had shops capable of heavy repairs and some railroads (for example, the Norfolk and Western Railway and the Pennsylvania Railroad, which had two erecting shops) constructed locomotives entirely in their own shops. Companies manufacturing locomotives in the US included Baldwin Locomotive Works, American Locomotive Company (ALCO), and Lima Locomotive Works. Altogether, between 1830 and 1950, over 160,000 steam locomotives were built in the United States, with Baldwin accounting for the largest share, nearly 70,000.

Steam locomotives required regular and, compared to a diesel-electric engine, frequent service and overhaul (often at government-regulated intervals in Europe and the US). Alterations and upgrades regularly occurred during overhauls. New appliances were added, unsatisfactory features removed, cylinders improved or replaced. Almost any part of the locomotive, including boilers, was replaced or upgraded. When service or upgrades got too expensive the locomotive was traded off or retired. On the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad two locomotives were dismantled; the boilers were placed onto two new Class T locomotives and the residual wheel machinery made into a pair of Class U switchers with new boilers. Union Pacific&#x27;s fleet of 3-cylinder engines were converted into two-cylinder engines in 1942, because of high maintenance problems.

===Australia===

In Sydney, Clyde Engineering and the Eveleigh Railway Workshops both built steam locomotives for the New South Wales Government Railways. These include the C38 class ; the first five were built at Clyde with streamlining, the other 25 locomotives were built at Eveleigh (13) and Cardiff Workshops (12) near Newcastle. In Queensland, steam locomotives were locally constructed by Walkers. Similarly, the South Australian Railways also manufactured steam locomotives locally at Islington Railway Workshops in Adelaide. Victorian Railways constructed most of their locomotives at its Newport Workshops and in Bendigo, while in the early days locomotives were built at the Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat. Locomotives constructed at the Newport shops ranged from the nA class built for the narrow gauge, up to the H class – the largest conventional locomotive ever to operate in Australia, weighing 260 tons. However, the title of largest locomotive ever used in Australia goes to the 263-ton New South Wales AD60 class locomotive Garratt, built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in England. Most steam locomotives used in Western Australia were built in the United Kingdom, though some examples were designed and built locally at the Western Australian Government Railways&#x27; Midland Railway Workshops. The 10 WAGR S class locomotives (introduced in 1943) were the only class of steam locomotive to be wholly conceived, designed and built in Western Australia, while the Midland workshops notably participated in the Australia-wide construction program of Australian Standard Garratts – these wartime locomotives were built at Midland in Western Australia, Clyde Engineering in New South Wales, Newport in Victoria and Islington in South Australia and saw varying degrees of service in all Australian states.
==The end of steam in general use==

The introduction of electric locomotives around the turn of the 20th century and later diesel-electric locomotives spelled the beginning of a decline in the use of steam locomotives, although it was some time before they were phased out of general use. As diesel power (especially with electric transmission) became more reliable in the 1930s, it gained a foothold in North America. The full transition away from steam power in North America took place during the 1950s. In continental Europe, large-scale electrification had replaced steam power by the 1970s. Steam was a familiar technology, adapted well to local facilities, and also consumed a wide variety of fuels; this led to its continued use in many countries until the end of the 20th century.

Steam engines have considerably less thermal efficiency than modern diesels, requiring constant maintenance and labour to keep them operational. Water is required at many points throughout a rail network, making it a major problem in desert areas, as are found in some regions of the United States, Australia and South Africa. In places where water is available, it may be hard, which can cause &quot;scale&quot; to form, composed mainly of calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide and calcium sulfate. Calcium and magnesium carbonates tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside the surfaces of pipes and heat exchangers. This precipitation is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration. The resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes. In boilers, the deposits impair the flow of heat into the water, reducing the heating efficiency and allowing the metal boiler components to overheat.

The reciprocating mechanism on the driving wheels of a two-cylinder single expansion steam locomotive tended to pound the rails (see hammer blow), thus requiring more maintenance. Raising steam from coal took a matter of hours, and created serious pollution problems. Coal-burning locomotives required fire cleaning and ash removal between turns of duty. Diesel or electric locomotives, by comparison, drew benefit from new custom-built servicing facilities. The smoke from steam locomotives was also deemed objectionable; the first electric and diesel locomotives were developed in response to smoke abatement requirements, although this did not take into account the high level of less-visible pollution in diesel exhaust smoke, especially when idling. In some countries, however, power for electric locomotives is derived from steam generated in power stations, which are often run by coal.

==Revival==



Dramatic increases in the cost of diesel fuel prompted several initiatives to revive steam power. However, none of these has progressed to the point of production and, as of the early 21st century, steam locomotives operate only in a few isolated regions of the world and in tourist operations.

As early as 1975, railway enthusiasts in the United Kingdom began building new steam locomotives. That year, Trevor Barber completed his gauge locomotive &quot;Trixie&quot; which ran on the Meirion Mill Railway. From the 1990s onwards, the number of new builds being completed rose dramatically with new locos completed by the narrow-gauge Ffestiniog and Corris railways in Wales. The Hunslet Engine Company was revived in 2005, and began building steam locomotives on a commercial basis. A standard-gauge LNER Peppercorn Pacific &quot;Tornado&quot; was completed at Hopetown Works, Darlington, and made its first run on 1 August 2008. It entered main line service later in 2008. over half-a-dozen projects to build working replicas of extinct steam engines are going ahead, in many cases using existing parts from other types to build them. Examples include BR 72010 &quot;Hengist&quot;, BR Class 3MT No. 82045, BR Class 2MT No. 84030, Brighton Atlantic &quot;Beachy Head&quot;, the LMS 5551 &quot;The Unknown Warrior&quot; project, GWR &quot;47xx 4709, 2999 &quot;Lady of Legend&quot;, 1014 &quot;County of Glamorgan&quot; and 6880 &quot;Betton Grange&quot; projects. These United Kingdom based new build projects are further complemented by the new build Pennsylvania Railroad 5550 project in the United States. One of the group&#x27;s goals is to surpass the steam locomotive speed record held by the 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot; when the 5550 is completed and for the 5550 to fill in a huge gap in steam locomotive preservation.

In 1980, American financier Ross Rowland established American Coal Enterprises to develop a modernised coal-fired steam locomotive. His ACE 3000 concept attracted considerable attention, but was never built.

In 1998, in his book &quot;The Red Devil and Other Tales from the Age of Steam&quot;, David Wardale put forward the concept of a high-speed high-efficiency &quot;Super Class 5 4-6-0&quot; locomotive for future steam haulage of tour trains on British main lines. The idea was formalised in 2001 by the formation of 5AT Project dedicated to developing and building the 5AT Advanced Technology Steam Locomotive, but it never received any major railway backing.

Locations where new builds are taking place include:
* GWR 1014 &quot;County of Glamorgan&quot; &amp; GWR 2999 &quot;Lady of Legend&quot;, both being built at Didcot Railway Centre
* GWR 6880 &quot;Betton Grange&quot;, GWR 4709 &amp; LMS 5551 &quot;The Unknown Warrior&quot;, all being built at Llangollen Railway
* LNER 2007 &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, Darlington Locomotive Works
* LNER 2001 Cock O&#x27; The North, Doncaster
* Pennsylvania Railroad 5550, Pottstown, Pennsylvania
* BR 72010 &quot;Hengist&quot;, Great Central Railway
* BR 77021, TBA
* BR 82045, Severn Valley Railway
* BR 84030 &amp; LBSCR 32424 Beachy Head, both being built at Bluebell Railway
* MS&amp;LR/GCR 567, Ruddington Great Central Railway, Northern Section
* VR V499, Victoria, Australia

In 2012, the Coalition for Sustainable Rail project was started in the US with the goal of creating a modern higher-speed steam locomotive, incorporating the improvements proposed by Livio Dante Porta and others, and using torrefied biomass as solid fuel. The fuel has been recently developed by the University of Minnesota in a collaboration between the university&#x27;s Institute on the Environment (IonE) and Sustainable Rail International (SRI), an organisation set up to explore the use of steam traction in a modern railway setup. The group have received the last surviving (but non-running) ATSF 3460 class steam locomotive (No. 3463) via donation from its previous owner in Kansas, the Great Overland Station Museum. They hope to use it as a platform for developing &quot;the world&#x27;s cleanest, most powerful passenger locomotive&quot;, capable of speeds up to . Named &quot;Project 130&quot;, it aims to break the world steam-train speed record set by LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard in the UK at . However, any demonstration of the project&#x27;s claims is yet to be seen.

In Germany, a small number of fireless steam locomotives are still working in industrial service, e.g. at power stations, where an on-site supply of steam is readily available.

The small town of Wolsztyn, Poland, approximately from the historic city of Poznań, is the last place in the world where one can ride a regularly scheduled passenger train pulled by steam power. The locomotive shed at Wolsztyn is the last of its kind in the world. There are several working locomotives that haul daily commuter service between Wolsztyn, Poznan, Leszo and other neighboring cities. One can partake in footplate courses via The Wolsztyn Experience. There is no place left in the world that still operates daily, non-tourist steam powered commuter/passenger service other than here at Wolsztyn. There are several Polish-built OL49-class 2-6-2 general purpose locomotives and one PT47 class 2-8-2 in regular service. Each May, Wolsztyn is the site of a steam locomotive festival which brings visiting locomotives - often well over a dozen each year all operating. These operations are not done for tourism or museum/historical purposes; this is the last non-diesel rail line on the PKP (Polish State Network) that has been converted to diesel power.

The Swiss company Dampflokomotiv- und Maschinenfabrik DLM AG delivered eight steam locomotives to rack railways in Switzerland and Austria between 1992 and 1996. Four of them are now the main traction on the Brienz Rothorn Bahn; the four others were built for the Schafbergbahn in Austria, where they run 90% of the trains.

The same company also rebuilt a German DR Class 52.80 2-10-0 locomotive to new standards with modifications such as roller bearings, light oil firing and boiler insulation.

==Climate change==
The future use of steam locomotives in the United Kingdom is in doubt because of government policy on climate change. The Heritage Railway Association is working with the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Heritage Rail in an effort to continue running steam locomotives on coal.

Many tourist railroads use oil-fired steam locomotives (or have converted their locomotives to run on oil) to reduce their environmental footprint, and because fuel oil can be easier to obtain than coal of the proper type and sizing for locomotives. For example, the Grand Canyon Railway runs its steam locomotives on used vegetable oil.

An organization called the Coalition for Sustainable Rail (CSR) is developing an environmentally friendly coal substitute made from torrefied biomass. In early 2019, they performed a series of tests using Everett Railroad to evaluate the performance of the biofuel, with positive results. The biofuel was found to burn slightly faster and hotter than coal. The goal of the project is primarily to find a sustainable fuel for historic steam locomotives on tourist railroads, but CSR has also suggested that, in the future, steam locomotives powered by torrefied biomass could be an environmentally and economically superior alternative to diesel locomotives. Also, a large vat containing salt may be used without needing to replenishing the medium. Large heating elements would be one method of recharging the system, however, it is possible to pump molten salt as well, removing the cooled salt and replenishing from facilities which contain a much larger vat.

==Steam locomotives in popular culture==
Steam locomotives have been present in popular culture since the 19th century. Folk songs from that period including &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Working on the Railroad&quot; and the &quot;Ballad of John Henry&quot; are a mainstay of American music and culture.

Many steam locomotive toys have been made, and railway modelling is a popular hobby.

Steam locomotives are often portrayed in fictional works, notably &quot;The Railway Series&quot; by the Rev W. V. Awdry, &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot; by Watty Piper, &quot;Starlight Express&quot; by Andrew Lloyd Webber, &quot;The Polar Express&quot; by Chris Van Allsburg, and the Hogwarts Express from J.K. Rowling&#x27;s Harry Potter series. They have also been featured in many children&#x27;s television shows, such as &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, based on characters from the books by Awdry, and &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot; created by Oliver Postgate.

The Hogwarts Express also appears in the Harry Potter series of films, portrayed by GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall in a special Hogwarts livery. The Polar Express appears in the animated movie of the same name.

An elaborate, themed funicular Hogwarts Express ride is featured in the Universal Orlando Resort in Florida, connecting the Harry Potter section of Universal Studios with the Islands of Adventure theme park.

The Polar Express is recreated on many heritage railroads in the United States, including the North Pole Express pulled by the Pere Marquette 1225 locomotive, which is operated by the Steam Railroading Institute in Owosso, Michigan. According to author Van Allsburg, this locomotive was the inspiration for the story and it was used in the production of the movie.

A number of computer and video games feature steam locomotives, such as Railroad Tycoon and Railway Empire. &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot;, produced in 1990, was named &quot;one of the best computer games of the year&quot;.

There are two notable examples of steam locomotives used as charges on heraldic coats of arms. One is that of Darlington, which displays &quot;Locomotion No. 1&quot;. The other is the original coat of arms of Swindon, not currently in use, which displays a basic steam locomotive.

Steam locomotives are a popular topic for coin collectors. The 1950 Silver 5 Peso coin of Mexico has a steam locomotive on its reverse as the prominent feature.

The 20 euro Biedermeier Period coin, minted 11 June 2003, shows on the obverse an early model steam locomotive (the &quot;Ajax&quot;) on Austria&#x27;s first railway line, the Kaiser Ferdinands-Nordbahn. The &quot;Ajax&quot; can still be seen today in the Technisches Museum Wien.
As part of the 50 State Quarters program, the quarter representing the US state of Utah depicts the ceremony where the two halves of the First transcontinental railroad met at Promontory Summit in 1869. The coin recreates a popular image from the ceremony with steam locomotives from each company facing each other while the golden spike is being driven.

The novel &quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot; by Kenji Miyazawa is centered on the idea of a steam train traveling among the stars. Miyazawa&#x27;s novel later inspired Leiji Matsumoto&#x27;s successful &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; series.

Another Japanese televisual franchise, Super Sentai, features monsters based on steam locomotives.

Charge Man, a Robot Master from the fifth installment of the Mega Man series is based on a steam locomotive.

<text>Iyengar Yoga, named after and developed by B. K. S. Iyengar, and described in his bestselling 1966 book &quot;Light on Yoga&quot;, is a form of yoga as exercise that has an emphasis on detail, precision and alignment in the performance of yoga postures (asanas).

The style often makes use of props, such as belts, blocks, and blankets, as aids in performing the asanas. The props enable beginning students, the elderly, or those with physical limitations to perform the asanas correctly, minimising the risk of injury or strain.

==History==

B. K. S. Iyengar learnt yoga from Tirumalai Krishnamacharya at the Mysore Palace, as did Pattabhi Jois; Iyengar Yoga and Jois&#x27;s Ashtanga (vinyasa) yoga are thus branches of the same yoga lineage, sharing many of the same asanas and other practices. Iyengar began teaching yoga as exercise gradually, starting with individual pupils such as the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, whom he met in 1952; Menuhin&#x27;s fame helped to propel Iyengar Yoga as a brand in the Western world.

A landmark was the publication of Iyengar&#x27;s bestselling book &quot;Light on Yoga&quot; in 1966, describing over 200 asanas in &quot;unprecedented&quot; detail. The yoga scholar Andrea Jain called the book &quot;arguably the most significant event in the process of elaborating the [Iyengar Yoga] brand&quot;. Jain and others have noted that the book&#x27;s biomedical claims, such as of toning up various organs of the body, were attractive to its audience but were stated directly without any supporting evidence. Authorities such as the yoga scholar Elliott Goldberg have described it as the bible of modern yoga; the book has sold over three million copies, and has been translated into at least 23 languages.

Iyengar Yoga became an institution with the 1975 founding of the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute in Pune, named in memory of his wife. A further major step was the founding of the first of many institutes abroad, the Iyengar Yoga Institute (IYI) in Maida Vale, London, in 1983. The old IYI building was replaced in 1994, and the new one was officially opened by Iyengar in person in 1997. Iyengar Yoga had however been taught in London before that, in evening classes run by the Inner London Education Authority starting in 1968. From the start, Iyengar personally assessed the quality of the teaching every year.

The first Iyengar Yoga Institute in America was founded in San Francisco in 1976 by Mary Dunn, Judith Lasater, and others; Iyengar visited the area that year. Further Iyengar Yoga Institutes have been opened in 1984 in Los Angeles, and in 1987 in New York. National Iyengar Yoga Associations have been created in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czechia, Chile, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and New Zealand.

==Style==

Iyengar Yoga is a form of yoga as exercise with a focus on the structural alignment of the physical body through the practice of asanas. It differs from other styles of yoga in three ways: precision, sequence and use of props.

* Precision is sought in body alignment in every asana.
* The sequences in which asanas are practiced is considered important in achieving the desired result.
* Iyengar Yoga led the use of props, designing suitable means to assist practitioners.

According to the Iyengar Yoga Institute, unlike more experiential approaches where students are encouraged to independently &quot;find their way&quot; to the asanas by imitating the teacher, an Iyengar Yoga class is precise, with misalignments and errors actively explained and corrected. It states that the style &quot;emphasises precision and alignment&quot;, and prioritises correct movement over quantity, i.e. moving a small amount in the right direction is preferred to moving more but in other directions. Postures are held for a relatively long period of time compared to other schools of yoga; this allows the muscles to relax and lengthen, and encourages awareness in the pose. Props including belts, blocks and blankets are freely used to assist students in correct working in the asanas.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; writes that Iyengar Yoga is characterized by great attention to detail and precise focus on body alignment. Iyengar pioneered the use of &quot;props&quot; such as cushions, benches, blocks, straps and sand bags, which function as aids allowing beginners to experience asanas more easily and fully than might otherwise be possible without several years of practice. Props also allow elderly, injured, tired or ill students to experience the benefits of a wider variety of asanas via fully &quot;supported&quot; methods requiring less muscular effort.

&quot;Yoga Journal&quot; notes that in contrast to other styles, beginners in Iyengar Yoga are introduced early on to standing poses (such as Trikonasana and Virabhadrasana), executed with careful attention to detail. For example, in Trikonasana, the feet are often jumped apart to a wide stance, the forward foot is turned out, and the centre of the forward heel is exactly aligned with the centre of the arch of the other foot.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that Iyengar Yoga is distinctive in its diversity of sequencing and choice of asanas. This, suggests Carrie Owerko, an Iyengar Yoga teacher, helps reduce injury. Owerko states that the style emphasises the inversion poses, headstand (Sirsasana) and shoulderstand (Sarvangasana), more than other styles, &quot;insist[ing] on a yoga blanket to prevent overstretching of the neck area&quot;. In Owerko&#x27;s words, &quot;Iyengar yoga is very cautious and mindful.&quot;

Dunn stated that &quot;People have incorrectly pigeonholed Iyengar Yoga into &#x27;alignment, technique, props&#x27; rather than &#x27;learning, experiencing, integrating&#x27;—which I think are the real words&quot;.

==Training, certification, and standards==

Until 2019, Iyengar teachers had to complete at least two years of yoga teacher training for the introductory certificate, with additional assessments for intermediate and senior levels of certification, potentially entailing a decade or more of training. The system was replaced from 2019, with a requirement for at least six years of practice, including three years of mentoring, before assessment.

Practitioners in the West can attend the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Institute (RIMYI) in Pune, Maharashtra, India once they have practised yoga for eight years. A &quot;Protocol&quot; governs attendance at the Pune institute.

In 2019, the Iyengar National Association of the United States decertified one of its most senior teachers, Manouso Manos, on grounds of sexual assault, and updated its ethics standards based on the Yamas and Niyamas in the &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; as a result.

==Invocation to Patanjali==

Iyengar Yoga (like Iyengar&#x27;s &quot;Light on Yoga&quot;) has the following invocation to Patanjali:

The yoga scholar Suzanne Newcombe notes that despite the references to Patanjali, Iyengar did not ask students to adopt any set of beliefs. She describes Iyengar as trying to &quot;teach an embodied experience of concentration and unity of body, breath, mind and soul&quot;, focussing on &quot;asana while teaching a method accessing all the different aspects of yoga within this single limb.&quot;

<doc id="196794" wikidata="Q163108" url="?curid=196794" title="Saint-Malo">
<text>Saint-Malo (, , ; Gallo: ; ) is a historic French port in Ille-et-Vilaine, Brittany.

The walled city on the English Channel coast had a long history of piracy, earning much wealth from local extortion and overseas adventures. In 1944, the Allies heavily bombed Saint-Malo. The city changed into a popular tourist centre, with a ferry terminal serving the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey, as well as the Southern English settlements of Portsmouth, Hampshire and Poole, Dorset.

The famous transatlantic single-handed yacht race Route du Rhum, which takes place every four years in November, is between Saint Malo and Pointe-à-Pitre in Guadeloupe.

==Population==
The population in 2017 was 46,097 – though this can increase to up to 300,000 in the summer tourist season. With the suburbs included, the metropolitan area&#x27;s population is approximately 133,000 (2017).

The population of the commune more than doubled in 1967 with the merging of three communes: Saint-Malo, Saint-Servan (population 14,963 in 1962) and Paramé (population 8,811 in 1962).

Inhabitants of Saint-Malo are called &quot;Malouins&quot; in French. The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Saint-Malo proper in its geography for the given years.

==History==
Founded by Gauls in the 1st century BC, the ancient town on the site of Saint-Malo was known as the Roman Reginca or Aletum. By the late 4th century AD, the Saint-Servan district was the site of a major Saxon Shore promontory fort that protected the Rance estuary from seaborne raiders from beyond the frontiers. According to the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, the fort was garrisoned by the &quot;militum Martensium&quot; under a &quot;dux&quot; (commander) of the &quot;Tractus Armoricanus et Nervicanus&quot; section of the &quot;litus Saxonicum&quot;. During the decline of the Western Roman Empire, Armorica (modern-day Brittany) rebelled from Roman rule under the Bagaudae and in the 5th and 6th centuries received many Celtic Britons fleeing instability across the Channel. The modern Saint-Malo traces its origins to a monastic settlement founded by Saint Aaron and Saint Brendan early in the sixth century. Its name is derived from a man said to have been a follower of Brendan the Navigator, Saint Malo or Maclou, an immigrant from what is now Wales.

Saint-Malo is the setting of Marie de France&#x27;s poem &quot;Laüstic,&quot; a 12th-century love story. The city had a tradition of asserting its autonomy in dealings with the French authorities and even with the local Breton authorities.

From 1590 to 1594, Saint-Malo declared itself to be an independent republic, when &#x27;la république de Saint-Malo&#x27; (Saint Malo Republic) functioned as a de facto city-state, and from whence the town takes its defiant motto &quot;not French, not Breton, but Malouin&quot; (‘&quot;Ni Français, ni Breton, Malouin suis&quot;’).
Saint-Malo became notorious as the home of the corsairs, French privateers and sometimes pirates. In the 19th century, this &quot;piratical&quot; notoriety was portrayed in Jean Richepin&#x27;s play &quot;Le flibustier&quot; and in César Cui&#x27;s eponymous opera. The corsairs of Saint-Malo not only forced English ships passing up the Channel to pay tribute but also brought wealth from further afield. Jacques Cartier lived in, and sailed from, Saint-Malo to the Saint Lawrence River, visiting the villages of Stadacona and Hochelaga that would later become the sites of present-day Quebec City and Montreal respectively. As the first European to encounter these sites and learning the local word &quot;Kanata&quot; (meaning a group of houses), Cartier is credited as the discoverer of Canada.

Inhabitants of Saint-Malo are called &quot;Malouins&quot; in French. From this came the Spanish name &quot;Islas Malvinas&quot; for the archipelago known in English as the Falkland Islands. Islas Malvinas derives from the 1764 name &quot;Îles Malouines&quot;, given to the islands by French explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville. Bougainville, who founded the archipelago&#x27;s first settlement, named the islands after the inhabitants of Saint-Malo, the point of departure for his ships and colonists.

In 1758, the Raid on Saint-Malo saw a British expedition land, intending to capture the town. However, the British made no attempt on Saint-Malo and instead occupied the nearby town of Saint-Servan, where they destroyed 30 privateers before departing.

===World War II===
In World War II, during fighting in late August and early September 1944, the historic walled city of Saint-Malo was almost totally destroyed by American shelling and bombing. The beaches of nearby Dinard had been heavily fortified against possible Allied commando raids. Artillery at the two locations provided mutual support. The fortification complex was garrisoned by more than twelve thousand German troops from different services and units as well as stragglers from other battles in the Cotentin. About eight thousand Germans were in Saint-Malo itself when the battle began.

Colonel Andreas von Aulock, the German commander, refused to surrender when asked to do so by the town&#x27;s authorities. He said he &quot;would defend St. Malo to the last man even if the last man had to be himself&quot;.

The first American attack was launched by the 83rd Infantry Division on 5 August 1944. German positions at Châteauneuf quickly fell. Cancale was abandoned and occupied by the Americans on the 6th. In the same way and on the same day, Dinan fell to Free French forces. The Germans shortened their lines and drew closer to the ancient citadel at St. Servan-sur-Mer, now reinforced with concrete.

Effective German artillery emplacements on the island of Cezembre were out of reach of American ground forces. German garrisons on the Channel Islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney were able to use small craft to bring in water and remove the wounded from the battle.

On 13 August, the walled city was on fire and a short truce was declared to allow French civilians to flee the city. Outlying German positions at St. Ideuc and La Varde fell to infantry attacks. This fighting ended resistance on the north shore of the peninsula. Only the citadel remained. Surrounded by American artillery and under frequent air attack, this last holdout surrendered on the afternoon of 17 August.

Cezembre surrendered on 2 September when the three-hundred-man garrison ran out of drinking water. The Americans had taken more than ten thousand prisoners during the two-week fight, von Aulock among them.

===Post-war===

Saint-Malo was rebuilt over a 12-year period from 1948 to 1960.

It is a subprefecture of the Ille-et-Vilaine. The commune of Saint-Servan was merged with Paramé, and became the commune of Saint-Malo in 1967.

Saint-Malo was the site of an Anglo-French summit in 1998 that led to a significant agreement regarding European defence policy.

== Climate ==
The Gulf of Saint-Malo has an oceanic temperate climate. Temperatures are softened by the Gulf Stream and the range of average temperatures between winter and summer is very low (from 6.1°C in January to 17.8°C in August) with an average temperature of 11.6°C.

== Politics ==
Saint-Malo is part of Ille-et-Vilaine&#x27;s 7th constituency, and is currently represented in the National Assembly by Republicans Member of Parliament, Jean-Luc Bourgeaux.

== Education ==
=== Schools ===
Schools include:
* 13 public preschools (&quot;écoles maternelles&quot;)
* 11 public elementary schools
* 8 private preschools and elementary schools
* 3 public collèges: Chateaubriand, Duguay-Trouin, and Charcot
* 3 private junior high schools: Choisy Jeanne d&#x27;Arc, Moka, and Sacré-Cœur
* 3 public senior high schools: Lycée Maupertuis, Lycée Jacques Cartier, Professional Maritime Lycée Les Rimains
* 2 private senior high schools: Lycée Institution Saint Malo-La Providence and Les Rimains

=== Higher education ===
* Institute of Technology of Saint-Malo
* A nurse school
* A maritime school

==Transport==
Saint-Malo has a terminal for ferry services with daily departures to Portsmouth operated by Brittany Ferries, and services on most days to Poole in England via the Channel Islands operated by Condor Ferries. It also has a railway station, Gare de Saint-Malo, offering direct TGV service to Rennes, Paris and several regional destinations. There is a bus service provided by Keolis. The town is served by the Dinard–Pleurtuit–Saint-Malo Airport around to the south.

==Sites of interest==

Now inseparably attached to the mainland, Saint-Malo is the most visited place in Brittany. Sites of interest include:

* The walled city (&quot;La Ville Intra-Muros&quot;)
* The château of Saint-Malo, part of which is now the town museum
* The Solidor Tower in Saint-Servan is a 14th-century building that holds a collection tracing the history of voyages around Cape Horn. Many scale models, nautical instruments and objects made by the sailors during their crossing or brought back from foreign ports invoke thoughts of travel aboard extraordinary tall ships at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.
* The tomb of the writer Chateaubriand on the Ile du Grand Bé

&quot;Missouri&quot; spent her entire career in the Atlantic with the North Atlantic Fleet, later renamed the Atlantic Fleet. In late 1907, she and the rest of the Atlantic Fleet circumnavigated the globe as the so-called Great White Fleet, which ended in February 1909. The ship was decommissioned in 1910, with periodic reactivations for summer training cruises over the followed six years. After America entered World War I in April 1917, &quot;Missouri&quot; was brought back into service to train personnel for the expanding wartime Navy. She served briefly as a troopship in 1919, carrying American soldiers back from France, before being decommissioned in September that year. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in January 1922.

==Description==
The United States Congress passed a major naval construction program in response to the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898; the program included three new battleships, which were to become the &quot;Maine&quot; class. The class incorporated several significant technological developments, including smaller caliber main guns that used smokeless powder to achieve greater muzzle velocity (and thus penetrating power), Krupp cemented armor that was stronger than Harvey armor used on earlier vessels, and water-tube boilers that provided more power for the engines.

&quot;Missouri&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by twelve coal-fired Thornycroft boilers, which were vented into three funnels. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by cage masts in 1909. She had a crew of 561 officers and enlisted men, which increased to 779–813.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four /40 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen /50 caliber Mark 6 guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried six /50 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull, eight 3-pounder guns, and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Missouri&quot; carried two  torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Missouri&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had the same thickness of armor plating on their exposed sides. Armor that was 6 in thick protected the secondary battery. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==
===1900 – 1907===
&quot;Missouri&quot; was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company on 7 February 1900, the third member of the class to be begun. She was launched on 28 December 1901 and commissioned into the fleet on 1 December 1903. The ship was assigned to the North Atlantic Fleet after entering service. She steamed out of Norfolk to begin her sea trials off the Virginia Capes on 4 February 1904 before joining the rest of the fleet in the Caribbean for training exercises.

On 13 April, the ship suffered an accident during gunnery training; the port 12-inch gun in her rear turret flared backward on firing and ignited three propellant charges in the turret. The resulting fire suffocated 36 men in the turret, though quick action among surviving members of the turret crew prevented the fire from spreading to the magazines, where it would have destroyed the ship. For their actions, three men were awarded the Medal of Honor. &quot;Missouri&quot; returned to Newport News for repairs, which were completed by early June.

On 9 June, &quot;Missouri&quot; left Newport News for a tour of the Mediterranean, arriving back in New York on 17 December. She remained with the North Atlantic Fleet for the next three years conducting normal peacetime training. During this period, the fleet was renamed the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Missouri&quot; assisted in relief work in Kingston, Jamaica from 17 to 19 January 1907, following a severe earthquake there. That April, she participated in the Jamestown Exposition. The ceremonies were held to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown colony. An international fleet that included British, French, German, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event.

===Great White Fleet===

&quot;Missouri&quot;″s next significant action was the cruise of the Great White Fleet around the world, which started with a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt in Hampton Roads. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression.

On 17 December, the fleet steamed out of Hampton Roads and cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland.

After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled . There, they conducted a naval review for Roosevelt.

===Later career===

&quot;Missouri&quot; spent the next several years laid up, with periodic reactivations for summer training cruises for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy. She was reduced temporarily to reserve status on 1 May 1910 in Boston, though she was recommissioned on 1 June 1911 for service with the Atlantic Fleet. In June 1912, the ship was deployed to Cuba with a contingent of Marines to protect American interests during a rebellion in the country. She conducted a midshipmen training cruise in July before being decommissioned a second time on 9 September, this time at Philadelphia. She returned to service on 16 March 1914 for another midshipmen cruise, which visited Italy and Great Britain. On 2 December, she was again decommissioned before returning to service on 15 April 1915 for a midshipmen cruise in the Caribbean, through the Panama Canal, and to visit ports in California. After arriving back in Philadelphia, she was reduced to the Reserve Fleet yet again on 18 October. Another period of active service began on 2 May 1916 for a training cruise along the east coast of the United States and into the Caribbean, before &quot;Missouri&quot; was again laid up late in the year.

On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany, entering World War I. &quot;Missouri&quot; was recommissioned on 23 April for service as a training ship for gunners and engine room personnel, based in the Chesapeake Bay. Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Missouri&quot; on 26 August, as the commander of the 2nd Division, Atlantic Fleet. On 11 November 1918, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the war. &quot;Missouri&quot; was subsequently used to ferry American soldiers back from Europe as part of the Cruiser and Transport Force. Her first voyage began on 15 February 1919 when she steamed out of Norfolk; three more would follow that year. In the course of the four trips, she carried 3,278 soldiers back to the United States. The old battleship was decommissioned for the last time on 8 September 1919 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. &quot;Missouri&quot; was sold to J. G. Hitner and W. F. Cutler of Philadelphia on 26 January 1922 and subsequently broken up for scrap.

<text>Ali Daei ( ; born 21 March 1969) is an Iranian football manager and former professional footballer. A striker, he was the captain of the Iranian national team between 2000 and 2006. He played in the German Bundesliga for Arminia Bielefeld, Bayern Munich and Hertha Berlin. He is regarded as one of the greatest Iranian footballers of all time as well as one of the greatest footballers from Asia.

A tall forward, Daei was a prolific goal-scorer, who was known for his heading accuracy and ability in the air. He was the world&#x27;s top international goal-scorer with 108 goals until his record was broken by Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021 and went to third after being surpassed again by Lionel Messi in 2024. During his playing career, Daei was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2001. Following his retirement, Daei served as a member of the FIFA Football Committee between 2007 and 2013. In 2014, he was inducted into the Asian Football Hall of Fame.

==Club career==

===Early years===

Daei was born in Ardabil, Imperial Iran, to an Iranian Azerbaijani family. Daei graduated from Sharif University of Technology in Materials Engineering (Metallurgical) with a BSc. degree. He began his playing career at 19 with his hometown club Esteghlal Ardabil. His next club was Taxirani F.C. in Tehran, where he played for one season, before joining another Tehran-based club, Bank Tejarat. His tenure with Bank Tejarat lasted four years, scoring 49 goals in 75 games.

===Move to Europe===
After his success with Bank Tejarat FC, in 1994, Daei joined one of Tehran&#x27;s leading clubs, Persepolis. He scored 23 goals in 38 games for the club from 1994 to 1996. Following his impressive performance in the Asian Cup in 1996, he moved to Al Sadd for the 1996–1997 season before joining Bundesliga side Arminia Bielefeld in 1997 alongside fellow Iranian national teammate Karim Bagheri.

Yet at Bayern, he found himself low in the pecking order. This, coupled with the Iranian national team&#x27;s scheduling, Daei had found very little time for playing. Daei was unhappy with his club position and decided to move to Hertha BSC before the end of his three-year contract when Bayern won the championship title in the 1999 Bundesliga.

Daei became the first Asian player to feature in a UEFA Champions League match. He scored his first and second goal in the UEFA Champions League on 21 September 1999 in a group stage match against Chelsea, won by Hertha 2–1. He also scored in a 1–1 draw against A.C. Milan at the San Siro. At Hertha he was a hugely influential player since he was only one of the squad&#x27;s many successful players, who were to fulfill Hertha&#x27;s Bundesliga and UEFA Champions League dreams.

===Return to Asia===

Daei was playing in numerous continental friendlies against world-class opposition, yet was still unable to maintain a stable position in his club&#x27;s starting line-up. In 2001, he was not among the top scorers in the Asian Qualifying round and he did not manage to take the team into the World Cup as captain for the first time. He joined the UAE league at 34 years of age, signing a contract with Al-Shabab as a free agent. In 2003, Daei quit the UAE team and joined his team in Tehran, Persepolis. Daei moved from Persepolis to Saba Battery on a free transfer for a modest contract of around $300,000.

He spent two years at Saba Battery, scoring 23 goals, winning the Hazfi Cup and participating in the Asian Champions League. After World Cup 2006 and the arrival of Saba Battery&#x27;s new manager, Farhad Kazemi, it was announced that he was no longer needed on the team and his contract would not be renewed. Despite rumors of retirement, he signed for another industry-linked club from Tehran, Saipa, on 1 August 2006.

On 6 March 2007, Ali Daei was fined $2000 and suspended for four games by the Iranian Football Federation after the incidents in a league game where he delivered a head-butt to the face of Sheys Rezaei.

On 28 May 2007, after Saipa won the 2006–07 Persian Gulf Cup in a match vs Mes Kerman, Daei announced his retirement from playing club football and that he would concentrate on his coaching career.

==International career==

Daei was named the World&#x27;s top scorer in official international competitions by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS), having scored 20 goals in competitive matches for Iran in 1996, including his famous four-goal haul against South Korea in Asian Cup 1996. By the end of the 1996 Asian Cup, he had scored 29 goals in 38 appearances for Iran. In the 1998 World Cup qualifying campaign, he was again on top of the charts, scoring nine goals in 17 matches for Iran, reaching at that time, 38 goals in 52 appearances for his country.

Daei joined the exclusive circle of players with a century of caps. In a 28 November 2003 Asian Cup qualifier in Tehran against Lebanon, he scored his 85th international goal, elevating him past the Hungarian Ferenc Puskás to top the all-time list of scorers in international matches. On 17 November 2004, he scored four goals against Laos in a World Cup qualifier, giving him 102 goals and making him the first male player to score 100 goals in international play. He has 148 caps for Iran and, as of 13 September 2019, is ranked 28th among the world&#x27;s most capped players list.

Daei was called up to join &quot;Team Melli&quot; on 6 June 1993 in an ECO Cup tournament held in Tehran, where he made his debut for Iran against Pakistan. He continued his national team appearances and was named the top scorer of the final Asian round of 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifications with four goals in 5 matches.

On 17 November 2004, Daei became the first male footballer with 100 international goals when he scored four times against Laos in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier.

Despite criticism, Daei played in the 2006 FIFA World Cup; the complaints, however, were directed more at his fitness and the inability of younger players to play a part in the World Cup. From Iranian media calling for his retirement, Ali Daei has always defended his position in &quot;Team Melli&quot; and has rejected that he was too old to play for the team.

Daei ended his international career with 109 goals, an all-time record which stood until September 2021 when it was surpassed by Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo. &quot;I am honoured that this remarkable achievement will belong to Ronaldo,&quot; Daei wrote on Instagram.

== College career ==
Daei captained Islamic Azad University football team in 2007 World Interuniversity Games, scoring a hat-trick in the final match against University of Osijek and winning the gold medal.

=== Coaching ===
In 2007 Summer Universiade, Daei was in charge as the head coach of the Iran student&#x27;s national team.

He was technical manager of the Islamic Azad University team in 2009 World Interuniversity Games.

==Managerial career==

===Saipa===

On 8 October 2006, upon the sudden leave of Saipa&#x27;s German coach Werner Lorant, he was appointed as the interim manager of Saipa. He was later officially announced as the full-time manager. On 28 May, Saipa became the Persian Gulf Cup champions in Daei&#x27;s first season at the helm. Going into his second season as manager, Daei relinquished his playing duties for the defending champions and found himself on the sidelines full-time. The results of Saipa&#x27;s 2007–2008 campaign were not nearly as successful as his team finished 11th in the 18 teams Iran Pro League table. However, Daei did lead Saipa to an Asian Champions League quarterfinal berth before leaving to take over as the full-time manager of the Iranian national football team.

===Iran national football team===
On 2 March 2008, IRIFF officially appointed Ali Daei as Team Melli&#x27;s new head coach. Despite admitting that his appointment as manager of the Iranian national team was a &quot;surprise&quot;, Daei refused to leave his current coaching job at Saipa F.C., therefore taking on dual managerial careers until after Saipa had entered the Asian Champion League quarterfinals, after which Daei left Saipa by mutual consent. While Daei guided Iran to a respectable 16–6–3 mark, his third loss on 28 March 2009 to a Saudi Arabian team that was down 1–0 to Iran in Tehran proved to be the final straw.

During his tenure as the National Team coach, the Iranian team managed the weakest World Cup Qualification results, with only one win out of 5 WCQ games. After the loss in the 2010 World Cup Qualifier, Daei was fired as head coach after the match. While introducing many new players, such as Gholamreza Rezaei, and Ehsan Hajsafi, Daei&#x27;s squad was often in flux as to who would be invited to a fixture. Many critics also pointed towards the failures of Daei&#x27;s team to score and an unsolved weakness in the central defense as causes for his downfall.

===Persepolis===

In 2009, Daei turned down a job offer as manager of Rah Ahan. It was widely believed that Daei could be next-in-line for the coaching position of Persepolis. Still, the club chose Zlatko Kranjčar. On 28 December 2009, Daei was chosen as a coach of Persepolis. At the end of the 2009–10 Season, Persepolis finished fourth in the league, but they became Hazfi Cup champions. In the Hazfi Cup final, Persepolis defeated Azadegan League side Gostaresh Foolad Tabriz 4–1 on aggregate to qualify for the 2011 AFC Champions League. In the 2010–11 season, Persepolis finished fourth in the league and was eliminated in the group stage of the 2011 AFC Champions League but at the end of the season, Persepolis won the 2010–11 Hazfi Cup after defeating rivals Sepahan, Foolad and Malavan. Daei had many people against him while at Persepolis, including the chairman Habib Kashani and after contention with Kashani, he stated that &quot;I won&#x27;t work with Kashani Anymore&quot;.

On 20 June 2011, Technical committee of Persepolis re-appointed Daei as Persepolis&#x27;s head coach but he resigned on 21 June. The technical committee chose Hamid Estili as Daei&#x27;s successor on that day. During his time at Persepolis, Daei brought up many youngsters such as Hamidreza Ali Asgari and Saman Aghazamani and other players such as Hadi Norouzi and Maziar Zare were chosen for Team Melli thanks to Daei. Despite the fact that many challenges and difficulties, such as the leaders of fans and the clubs&#x27; Chairman Kashani were in Daei&#x27;s way, Persepolis was crowned Hazfi Cup Champions for two successive years, and the fans themselves always loved and cheered Daei. Still, at the same time, they did not cheer for any player. Under the management of Daei, Persepolis won back-to-back trophies for the first time in 13 seasons.

===Rah Ahan===
On 14 July 2011, Daei signed a one-year contract as head coach of Rah Ahan. In his first match as head coach of Rah Ahan, he made a 2–2 draw with Zob Ahan. In his first season as Rah Ahan&#x27;s head coach, he led the club to the 11th position.

During the 2012–13 season, Ali Daei used many young players such as Mojtaba Shiri and Omid Alishah. Rah Ahan finished the season in 8th place, the clubs&#x27; best finish in the league since 1937. Thanks to Daei&#x27;s popularity, more people started to watch Rah Ahan&#x27;s matches, and for the second straight year, Daei beat his former club Persepolis.

Despite many rumors that Daei will leave Rah Ahan for other clubs such as Persepolis or Tractor, he decided to stay with the club &quot;to build a team that can qualify for the AFC Champions League.&quot; However, his contract was terminated on 20 May 2013, making way for him to become head coach of Persepolis.

===Return to Persepolis===

On 20 May 2013, he signed a three-year contract to become head coach of Persepolis after a long negotiation. It was the second time that he signed with Persepolis, he returned to his former side after two seasons. He officially began his work with Persepolis on 1 June 2013. His first match came against Tractor, which Persepolis won 1–0, with the goal coming from Mehdi Seyed Salehi. At the end of his first year at Persepolis, his side finished runners-up, two points less than the champions Foolad.

He was sacked on 10 September 2014 after a poor start of 2014–15 season.

=== Saba Qom ===
On 1 July 2015, Daei became head coach of Saba Qom, signing a two-year contract. In two seasons with Saba, he finished ninth and seventh in the Persian Gulf Pro League. He left Saba a few weeks before the 2016–17 season due to uncertainty in the Saba&#x27;s ownership situation.

=== Naft Tehran ===
Daei became manager of Naft Tehran on 5 July 2016 by signing a two-year contract, replacing Alireza Mansourian. He led Naft to the Hazfi Cup title. Still, he left the club at the end of the season.

=== Return to Saipa ===
Daei became manager of Saipa on 14 May 2017, a club where he started his coaching career in 2006 and led them to the league title in 2007. He led the club for two seasons and was sacked at the end of 2018–19 season.

His company also made jerseys for the national team. He has made significant charitable donations and has made appearances in charity football matches worldwide (featuring in the World vs. Bosnia match with Roberto Baggio and others). He also appeared in a UNICEF commercial with David Beckham and Madeleine Albright, and has regularly been seen working with the organization.

Daei featured on 18 July 2007 in &quot;90 Minutes for Mandela&quot;, a match between the Africa XI and the Rest of the World XI to celebrate the birthday of Nelson Mandela. Daei played approximately 10 minutes in the match which ended 3–3.

===Religion===
Daei is a follower of Shia islam. While he played for Bayern Munich, he refused to hold a glass of beer for an Erdinger advertisement because alcoholic beverages are forbidden in his religion.

===Autobiography===
In April 2008, Daei announced that he had begun writing an autobiography, due to be released in March 2010, and that despite reflecting on &quot;bitter and sweet memories,&quot; he stated he would &quot;keep some of his secrets in his heart forever&quot;. The book has not yet been released.

===Accident===
On 17 March 2012, Daei&#x27;s car overturned while driving back to Tehran from Isfahan with his brother. Just before the accident, his team, Rah Ahan, had been beaten by Sepahan. Daei was then transferred to a hospital near Kashan. Rah Ahan&#x27;s Media Officer, Hossein Ghadousi stated that &quot;Daei is in a stable condition with regards to his vital signs and is not currently in any acute danger as a result of the accident&quot;. He was transferred to Laleh hospital in Tehran the following day.

A statement from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said: &quot;The AFC wishes Iranian legend Ali Daei, who was involved in a car accident on Saturday, a speedy and full recovery. We stand ready to assist Daei, a true icon of Asian football. Our thoughts and prayers are with him.&quot; Sepp Blatter, President of FIFA, said on his personal Twitter page that he was shocked to hear Daei was injured. He also wished for his recovery.

In November 2020, Daei was attacked by two thieves while they were trying to steal his gold necklace in Tehran.
Police announced that the two thieves were arrested a few days after they attacked Daei.

===Politics and activism===
