<text>The Ford Taunus is a family car that was sold by Ford Germany throughout Europe. Models from 1970 onward were built on the same basic construction as the Ford Cortina MkIII in the United Kingdom, and later on, the two car models were essentially the same, differing almost only in the placement of the steering wheel. The model line was named after the Taunus mountain range in Germany, and was first made in 1939, and continued through several versions until 1994.

==Taunus G93A (1939–1942) / G73A (1948–1952)==
The Ford Taunus G93A was a development of the Ford Eifel, and used the same 1172 cc four cylinder engine, but in a longer chassis and a streamlined body. It was the first German Ford to have hydraulic brakes. First introduced in 1939, production was halted in 1942 due to the war. Production recommenced in November 1948 after the British Occupation had ended. In total, 7,128 pre-war Taunuses (G93A) were made, including estate cars and light vans, followed by 76,590 post-war models (G73A).
==Taunus M-series (1952–1968)==
From 1952 to 1968, all German Fords were called the Taunus, using the model names 12M, 15M, 17M, 20M, and 26M (on some Scandinavian markets, for a short while the branding 10M was used on a slightly better-equipped export version of the early Taunus, which is said to be the precursor of later uses). The &quot;M&quot; is said to stand for &quot;Meisterstück&quot;, in English &quot;Masterpiece&quot;, but that word was found to be already registered by another German automaker. Taunus was also sometimes adopted as the brand name in export markets, particularly where British and North American Fords were also available.

The 12M, 15M, and 17M models had an engine, which in the first 12M was a carryover of the sidevalve (flathead) engine from the first Taunus series, and beginning with the 15M, it was replaced by an overhead-valve design similar to the British Ford Consul engine. With the introduction of the new 12M line (internal code P4) for 1962 came the V4 engine, which starting in late 1964 with the larger 17M/20M became the base engine for the Taunus M-series. The 20M and 26M models had the Ford Cologne V6 engine, which is basically the same engine design with two extra cylinders added. The 12, 15, 17, etc. numbers refer to the engine displacement; 1200, 1500, 1700 cc, etc. However, a few exceptions from that rule were made, such as 17M 1800, which was powered by the V6 in its smallest displacement and the 20M 2300S (in the later P7 series), which used a 2.3-litre version of the same engine.

From 1962 to 1970, the smaller models 12M (P4) and its successor 12M/15M (P6) had front wheel drive. All other models had rear wheel drive.

These models were offered:

===Smaller line: 12M, 15M===
====First generation 12M (G13) (1952–1959), 15M (1955–1959)====
The Taunus 12M presented in 1952 was the first new German Ford after World War II. It featured ponton styling, similar in style to British Ford Zephyr.

Something else the new Ford Taunus 12M had in common with British Fords was the retention of an old side-valve engine at a time when competitors were increasingly moving over to overhead-valve units. The Taunus 15M used a new and more powerful engine:
*12M: 1172 cc, , 
*15M: 1498 cc, , 

Body styles were two-door sedan, two-door station wagon, and sedan delivery.

====Second generation 12M (1959–1962)====
The second generation 12M was not a new car, but a reworking of the 1952 model. All cars were called 12M, though both engines were continued. The car with the bigger engine was called Taunus 12M 1.5-litre.

Body styles were the same as in the 1952 model.

====Third generation 12M (P4) (1962–1966)====
The new Ford Taunus 12M P4 was similar in size, but a completely new car based on the Ford Cardinal project: New body, new V4 engine, front-wheel drive. It was the first Ford car with front-wheel drive (second was the Ford Corcel, third was the Ford Fiesta). Engines available included:
*1.2-litre: 1183 cc, , 
*1.5-litre: 1498 cc, , 

Body styles were two-door sedan, four-door sedan, two-door coupé, two-door station wagon, and sedan delivery.

====Fourth generation 12M (P6) (1966–1970), 15M (P6) (1966–1970)====
The Ford Taunus P6 came with new bodies, whilst engines and platform were continued. The car with the bigger engine was now called 15M again. Engines available included:
*12M 1.2-litre: 1183 cc, , 
*12M 1.3-litre: 1305 cc, , 
*15M 1.5-litre: 1498 cc, , 
*15M 1.7-litre: 1699 cc, , 
Body styles were unchanged from the P4.

In 1970, the P6 was replaced by the Taunus TC.

===Bigger line: 17M, 20M, 26M===

====First generation 17M (P2) (1957–1960)====
Growing prosperity in postwar Germany encouraged Ford to offer a line of bigger and more expensive cars. The Ford Taunus 17M of 1957 was as long as (though significantly narrower than) the British Consul Mk2, but a different car. It presented a style similar to American 1955 Fords, featuring substantial (at least by European standards) tailfins. The transatlantic flamboyance of the car&#x27;s styling gained it the sobriquet &quot;Baroque Taunus&quot;, showing styling influences from the North American Mercury Monterey of the same time period. Unusually for middle-class German cars of this period, it was available with either two or four doors. The competition noticed, and from 1959, buying an Opel Rekord with four doors was possible.

The P2 used an overhead-valve (OHV) engine with 1698 cc and . A maximum speed of was quoted. A road test of the time commended the smoothness of the three-speed, all-synchromesh manual transmission system.

====Second generation 17M (P3) (1960–1964)====
The Ford Taunus P3 had a completely new body in a very modern style. The look of car reminded some critics of a bath tub, and it consequently gained the soubriquet &quot;Taunus &quot;Badewanne&quot;&quot;. At a time when competitors boasted that all four corners of the vehicles were visible from the driver&#x27;s seat, the new Taunus instead offered a streamlined form. However, in Germany the concept of streamlining in cars was associated with narrow passenger cabins reminiscent of the 1930s and of the still popular Volkswagen Beetle. The new Taunus, however, provided greater interior width than its predecessor, despite being no wider on the outside. Although the 1.7-litre version was launched with the same 60 PS power output as the outgoing model, the new model was a full faster, which was attributed to improved aerodynamics and a lighter body shell. The front end styling is reminiscent of the 1961 U.S. Ford Thunderbird and Lincoln Continental.

Three engine sizes were now offered:
*1.5-litre: 1498 cc, , 
*1.7-litre: 1698 cc, , 
*1.8-litre: 1758 cc, , 


====Third generation 17M (P5) (1964–1967), 20M (P5) (1964–1967)====
The Ford Taunus P5 came with a new body and new engines. The 17M now gets a V4 engine:
*1.5-litre: 1498 cc, , 
*1.7-litre: 1699 cc, , 
New 20M gets a V6 engine with 1.8-litres and , or 2.0-litres (1998 cc) and with a top speed of .
Again, it was a good selling car.

====Fourth generation 17M (P7) (1967–1968), 20M (P7) (1967–1968)====
For the new Ford P7, there was a new body; engines and platform were carried over from the P5. Rear lights were no longer mounted at corners. The 20M-model had a fake air scoop on the bonnet and a new, bigger engine.

The engines of the 17M/20M P5 were continued, with only one addition on the top end. It was the
*20M 2.3-litre: 2293 cc, , 

====Fifth generation 17M (P7b), 20M, 26M (1968–1971)====

Shrinking sales of the P7 forced Ford to offer a restyled car only one year later, and the new car was again called P7. Rear lights again mounted on corners. Here, to avoid confusion, it was called P7.2, sometimes it is called P7b. The name &quot;Taunus&quot; no longer used.

The 26M, introduced in 1969, is the top-of-the-line version with a new bigger engine (2.6-litres), bigger brakes, dual headlights, power steering, and the most luxurious trim level. V6-engines were slightly revised. The engine programme is enlarged; now, two base engines (V4 and V6) in six displacement sizes and nine power stages are available:
*V4
**17M 1.5-litre: 1498 cc, , 
**17M 1.7-litre: 1699 cc, , 
*V6
**17M 1.8-litre: 1812 cc, , 
**20M 2.0-litre: 1998 cc, , 
**20M 2.3-litre: 2293 cc, , 
**20M, 26M 2.6-litre: 2550 cc, , , optional on 20M, but standard on 26M.

;Ford 20M RS
The Ford 20M RS Coupé was made in Germany as a (2300 S) P7b and (2600) P7b. In the 1968 London-Sydney Marathon, Ford entered three Ford 20M RS from Germany and Belgium. In 1969, a Ford 20M RS won the Safari and occasionally a Capri was seen with works involvement.

This is the last specifically German Ford. In early 1972, it is replaced by the new Consul and Granada.

==Taunus TC (1970–1975)==

In 1970 a new Taunus, the Taunus Cortina (TC), was introduced. Ford offered a two- or four-door sedan or a five-door station wagon/estate (identified like previous Taunus estates as the &quot;Turnier&quot;). Between 1970 and 1975, for the first Taunus TC, a fashionable fast-back coupé was also included in the Taunus range.

This model also formed the basis of the Cortina Mk.III, but with different door skins and rear wing pressings from the &quot;coke-bottle&quot; styling of the Cortina. In addition, there was never a Cortina III equivalent to the fast-back bodied Taunus TC coupé. The Taunus TC and Cortina Mk.III were both developed under the auspices of Ford of Europe, and most major components including key parts of the bodyshell were identical.

==Taunus TC2 (1976–1979) and TC3 (1979–1982/1994)==

At the end of November 1975, in time for the 1976 model year, production began of the Taunus series &quot;GBTS&quot;. The Taunus and Cortina Mk IV were in most cases now almost identical, apart from regional variations (in terms of specification changes and trim levels).

The Taunus TC along with the Cortina Mk III and their successors have been produced in slightly updated forms in Europe, Argentina and widely across Asia by Ford or their local co-operators. Cortinas were also built in small numbers starting with the predecessor Cortina Mk II throughout the model series&#x27; European/east Asian lifespan under license by Korean automaker Hyundai. This led to the Cortina 80 at the end of its production life serving as a starting point for the first Hyundai Stellar which succeeded the Cortina line in South Korea, handing over some major technical components such as the steering rack and the transmission propelling shaft to the otherwise non-Ford successor.

In 1982 production of the Taunus ceased in Europe; it was replaced by the Ford Sierra. The Sierra carried over the Cortina/Taunus OHC Pinto Engines and RWD configuration but was otherwise an all new car with independent suspension all round.
== Production in Argentina and Turkey ==

The Taunus was produced in Argentina from 1974 up until the end of 1984, when the production assembly was sold to Turkey to manufacture the Otosan Taunus. The Turkish car, easily distinguishable because of its remolded front and back panels continued in production until 1994.

<text>Susan Mary Gillian Travers (23 September 1909 – 18 December 2003) was a British nurse and ambulance driver who served in the French Red Cross during the Second World War. She later became the only woman to be enlisted in the French Foreign Legion, having also served in French Indochina, during the First Indochina War.

==Early life==
Travers was born in Kensington and spent her early years in England, the daughter of Francis Eaton Travers, a Royal Navy Admiral, and his wife Eleanor Catherine ().

==World War II==
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Travers joined the French Red Cross as a nurse. Later, she became an ambulance driver with the French Expeditionary Force in Finland in 1940. After the fall of France, she went to London and joined the Free French under Charles de Gaulle. In 1941, she drove a medical doctor of the 1st Free French Division during Operation Exporter in Syria and Lebanon, during which the Allied forces invaded and seized Syria and Lebanon from the Vichy French. She served in the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion as a driver for the medical officer, where she gained the nickname &quot;La Miss&quot;.

The 13th Demi-Brigade was incorporated into the 1st Brigade of the 1st Free French Division, commanded by Colonel Marie-Pierre Kœnig. Travers was assigned as the driver to Kœnig. They became lovers.

In May 1942, the 1st Free French Brigade was posted at Bir Hakeim, the southern end of the British Eighth Army&#x27;s line at Gazala in Libya. As the Panzer Army Africa prepared to attack the British line, Kœnig ordered all women out of the area. The Axis forces attacked on 26 May, initiating the Battle of Gazala. Four German and Italian divisions attacked Bir Hakeim. Not long after, Travers joined a convoy into the rear area, and Kœnig allowed her to return to Bir Hakeim, as it seemed the Axis attack had failed. During the next two weeks, the Axis continued to attack, heavily shelling and bombing Bir Hakeim. During the bombardment, a shell tore off the roof of Kœnig&#x27;s car. Travers, aided by a Vietnamese driver, fixed it on the spot immediately.

During the night of 10–11 June, 1st FF Brigade evacuated Bir Hakeim, with Travers driving Kœnig&#x27;s staff car. The column ran into minefields and German machine gun fire. Kœnig ordered Travers to drive at the front of the column. Travers stated:

At 10:30 a.m. on 11 June, the column entered British lines. Travers&#x27; vehicle had eleven bullet holes, with a shock absorber destroyed and the brakes unserviceable.

Kœnig was promoted to general and left the North African theatre for higher command and a reunion with his wife. Travers, driving a self-propelled anti-tank gun, remained with the French Foreign Legion. She later served in the Italian Campaign and the Western Front (in France and Germany), during which she was wounded when she drove over a land mine.

==Post-war==
After the war, her military status was regularized. She applied to and was formally enrolled in the &quot;Légion Étrangère&quot;, as an &quot;adjudant-chef&quot;.

Travers served in Indochina. She married Legion &quot;Adjudant-Chef&quot; Nicolas Schlegelmilch, who had fought at Bir Hakeim with the 13th Demi-Brigade. In retirement, they lived on the outskirts of Paris. The couple is survived by two sons.

She waited for all the other principals in her life story to die before writing her autobiography. In 2000, aged 91, assisted by Wendy Holden, she wrote her autobiography, &quot;Tomorrow to Be Brave: A Memoir of the Only Woman Ever to Serve in the French Foreign Legion&quot; ().

<doc id="188788" wikidata="Q682483" url="?curid=188788" title="Refining">
<text>Refining is the process of purification of a (1) substance or a (2) form. The term is usually used of a natural resource that is almost in a usable form, but which is more useful in its pure form. For instance, most types of natural petroleum will burn straight from the ground, but it will burn poorly and quickly clog an engine with residues and by-products. The term is broad, and may include more drastic transformations, such as the reduction of ore to metal (for which see Refining (metallurgy)).

The refining of liquids is often accomplished by distillation or fractionation; this process is useful, for example, for isolating different fractions of petroleum. Gases can be refined in this way as well, by being cooled and/or compressed until they liquefy. Gases and liquids can also be refined by extraction with a selective solvent that dissolves away either the substance of interest, or the unwanted impurities.

Many solids can be refined by growing crystals in a solution of the impure material; the regular structure of the crystal tends to favor the desired material and exclude other kinds of particles.

Chemical reactions are often used to remove impurities of particular types.

The use of silicon and other semiconductors in electronics depends on precise control of impurities. The zone melting process developed by William Gardner Pfann was used to produce pure germanium, and subsequently float-zone silicon became available when Henry Theuerer of Bell Labs adapted Pfann&#x27;s method to silicon.

Types of materials that are usually refined:
* metals (see Refining (metallurgy)
* petroleum (see Oil refinery)
* silicon
* sugar (see Sugar refinery)
* flour (see Gristmill)
* table salt
* vegetable oil (see Food oil refinement for food use and Vegetable oil refining for biofuel use)
* air
* glass

==See also==
*Continuous distillation
*Natural gas processing
*Refinery

<doc id="188800" wikidata="Q1137711" url="?curid=188800" title="The finger">
<text>&quot;The finger&quot;, or the middle finger (as in giving someone the (middle) finger, flipping the bird or flipping someone off) is an obscene hand gesture. The gesture communicates moderate to extreme contempt, and is roughly equivalent in meaning to &quot;fuck you&quot;, &quot;fuck me&quot;, &quot;shove it up your ass/arse&quot;, &quot;up yours&quot;, or &quot;go fuck yourself&quot;. It is performed by showing the back of a hand that has only the middle finger extended upwards, though in some locales, the thumb is extended. Extending the finger is considered a symbol of contempt in several cultures, especially in the Western world. Many cultures use similar gestures to display their disrespect, although others use it to express pointing without intentional disrespect. The gesture is usually used to express contempt but can also be used humorously or playfully.

The gesture dates back to ancient Greece and it was also used in ancient Rome. Historically, it represented a phallus. In the early 1800s, it gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect and was used by music artists (notably more common among actors, celebrities, athletes and politicians; most still view the gesture as obscene). In more contemporary periods, the bent index and ring fingers on each side of the middle finger have been likened to represent the testes.

==Classical era==
The middle finger gesture was used in ancient times as a symbol of sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate, and threaten the individual receiving the gesture. It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the middle finger representing testicles; from its close association, the gesture may have assumed apotropaic potency. In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the &quot;finger&quot; was one of many methods used to divert the ever-present threat of the evil eye.

In Greek, the gesture was known as the &quot;katapygon&quot; (&quot;κατάπυγον&quot;, from &quot;kata&quot; – κατά, &quot;downwards&quot; and &quot;pugē&quot; – πυγή, &quot;rump, buttocks&quot;). In ancient Greek comedy, the finger was a gesture of insult toward another person, with the term &quot;katapugon&quot; also referring to &quot;a male who submits to anal penetration&quot; or &quot;katapygaina&quot; to a female. In Aristophanes&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Clouds&quot; (423 BC), when the character Socrates is quizzing his student on poetic meters, Strepsiades declares that he knows quite well what a dactyl is, and gives the finger. The gesture is a visual pun on the two meanings of the Greek word &quot;daktylos&quot;, both &quot;finger&quot; and the rhythmic measure composed of a long syllable and two short, like the joints of a finger ( which also appears as a visual pun on the penis and testicles in a medieval Latin text). Socrates called one who made the gesture &quot;boorish and stupid.&quot; The gesture recurs as a form of mockery in &quot;Peace&quot;, alongside farting in someone&#x27;s face. The usage is later explained in the &quot;Suda&quot; and included in the &quot;Adagia&quot; of Erasmus. The verb &quot;to play the Siphnian&quot; appears in a fragment of Aristophanes and has a similar meaning. The usage is once again explained in the &quot;Suda&quot;, where it is said to mean &quot;to touch the anus with a finger.&quot; Diogenes Laërtius records how the Cynic philosopher Diogenes of Sinope directed the gesture at the orator Demosthenes in 4th-century BC Athens. In the &quot;Discourses of Epictetus&quot;, Diogenes&#x27;s target is instead one of the sophists.
In Latin, the middle finger was the &quot;digitus impudicus&quot;, meaning the &quot;shameless, indecent or offensive finger&quot;. In the 1st century AD, Persius had superstitious female relatives concoct a charm with the &quot;infamous finger&quot; (&quot;digitus infamis&quot;) and &quot;purifying spit&quot; while in the &quot;Satyricon&quot;, an old woman uses dust, spit and her middle finger to mark the forehead before casting a spell. The poet Martial has a character in good health extend &quot;the indecent one&quot; toward three doctors. In another epigram, Martial wrote: &quot;Laugh loud, Sextillus, at whoever calls you a &quot;cinaedus&quot; and extend your middle finger.&quot; Juvenal, through synecdoche, has the &quot;middle nail&quot; cocked at threatening Fortuna. The indecent finger features again in a mocking context in the &quot;Priapeia&quot;, a collection of poems relating to the phallic god Priapus. In Late Antiquity, the term &quot;shameless finger&quot; is explained in the &quot;Etymologiae&quot; of Isidore of Seville with reference to its frequent use when accusing someone of a &quot;shameful action.&quot;

==United States==
Linguist Jesse Sheidlower traces the gesture&#x27;s development in the United States to the 1890s. According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, the gesture probably came to the United States via Italian immigrants. The first documented appearance of the finger in the United States was in 1886, when Old Hoss Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it to a member of their rival the New York Giants.

Use of this gesture in public, while vulgar, is not unlawful, as it is considered expressive communication protected by the First Amendment. In some cases, offended police officers who have had the insulting gesture displayed to them have stopped, ticketed, or arrested people for doing so. However, it is neither a crime, nor even probable cause to stop a person, and a police officer who does so violates &quot;a clearly established constitutional right,&quot; and does not have qualified immunity if they do so, which means they can be sued for monetary damages for the unlawful stop and/or arrest. &quot;Cruise-Gulyas v. Minard&quot; 918 F.3d 494 (2019).

==Canada==
In 2023, in a ruling issued February 24 regarding a Canadian man who was accused of criminal harassment and uttering threats, Quebec court Judge Dennis Galiatsatos wrote, &quot;To be abundantly clear, it is not a crime to give someone the finger,&quot; and, &quot;Flipping the proverbial bird is a God-given, Charter-enshrined right that belongs to every red-blooded Canadian. It may not be civil, it may not be polite, it may not be gentlemanly. Nevertheless, it does not trigger criminal liability.&quot; The accused man was acquitted.

==Early appearance in films==
During a wedding sequence in one of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s silent films, &quot;The Ring&quot; (1927), a misunderstanding results in the ringbearer giving the finger to another member of the wedding party, to comedic effect.

In the film &quot;Speedy&quot; (1928), Harold Lloyd&#x27;s character gives himself the finger into a distorting mirror at Luna Park, about 25 minutes into the film.

==Political and military use==
The gesture has been involved in political events. During the incident, in which an American ship was captured by North Korea, the captured American crewmembers often discreetly gave the finger in staged photo ops, undermining the North Koreans&#x27; use of the images in their propaganda. The North Koreans, ignorant of what the gesture meant, were at first told by the prisoners that it was a &quot;Hawaiian good luck sign&quot;, similar to the shaka. When the guards finally figured things out, the crewmembers were subjected to extremely severe beatings. Abbie Hoffman used the gesture at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Ronald Reagan, while serving as the Governor of California, gave the middle finger to counterculture protesters in Berkeley, California. Nelson Rockefeller, then the Vice President of the United States, directed the gesture to hecklers at a 1976 campaign stop near Binghamton, New York, leading it to be called the &quot;Rockefeller gesture&quot;. In 1982, Pierre Trudeau, then the Prime Minister of Canada, gave the finger to protesters in Salmon Arm, British Columbia, earning the incident the nickname the &quot;Salmon Arm salute&quot;. The gesture itself has also been nicknamed the &quot;Trudeau salute&quot;. Former president George W. Bush gave the finger to the camera at an Austin production facility during his term as governor of Texas, saying it was &quot;just a one-finger victory salute.&quot; Anthony Weiner gave the finger to reporters after leaving his election headquarters the night he lost the 2013 primary election for Mayor of New York City. During the campaign for the 2013 German federal election, the leading candidate of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, Peer Steinbrück controversially gave the finger in a photo interview with &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Magazin&quot; supplement.

During World War II, the 91st Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces referred to the gesture as the &quot;rigid digit&quot; salute. It was used in a more jocular manner, to suggest an airman had committed an error or infraction; the term was a reference to British slang terms for inattentiveness (i.e. &quot;pull your finger out (of your bum)&quot;). The &quot;order of the rigid digit&quot; continued after the war as a series of awards presented by the veteran&#x27;s association of the 91st, marked by wooden statuettes of a hand giving the single finger gesture. In 2005 during the war in Iraq, Gunnery Sergeant Michael Burghardt gained prominence when the Omaha World-Herald published a photo of Burghardt making the gesture towards Iraqi insurgents he believed to be watching after an improvised explosive device failed to kill him.

The middle finger has been involved in judicial hearings. An appellate court in Hartford, Connecticut ruled in 1976 that gesturing with the middle finger was offensive, but not obscene, after a police officer charged a 16-year-old with making an obscene gesture when the student gave the officer the middle finger. The case was appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court, which upheld the decision. In March 2006, a federal lawsuit was filed regarding the free speech issue.

Giving the finger has resulted in negative consequences. A Malaysian man was bludgeoned to death after giving the finger to a motorist following a car chase. A Pakistani man was deported by the United Arab Emirates for the gesture, which violates indecency codes.

People have given the finger as a method of political protest. At a concert, Ricky Martin gave a picture of George W. Bush the finger to protest the War in Iraq. Serbian protesters gave the finger to the Russian embassy regarding their support of Slobodan Milošević. Artist Ai Weiwei has used the finger in photographs and sculptures as a political statement. As a political message to the Czech President Miloš Zeman, Czech artist David Černý floated an outsize, purple statue of a hand on the River Vltava in Prague; its middle finger extended towards Prague Castle, the Presidential seat. Černý had also mounted a middle finger on a pink former Soviet tank from the Monument to Soviet Tank Crews in 1991.
In 2011–2012, the pink tank with the finger was displayed again on a barge on the Vltava.

In 2017 Juli Briskman gave the finger to the motorcade of Donald Trump as it drove past her while bicycling, and a photograph that went viral forced her to resign from her job as a marketing executive. However, the notoriety may have been favorable in her 2019 election to the board of supervisors for Loudoun County, Virginia.

On February 24, 2022, the first day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian missile cruiser &quot;Moskva&quot; attacked Snake Island as part of the 2022 Snake Island campaign. The Ukrainian border guard Roman Hrybov&#x27;s last communication with the warship was &quot;Russian warship, go fuck yourself&quot;. This was memorialized on a set of Ukrainian commemorative postage stamps on April 12 with the text &quot;Russian warship, fuck you!&quot; and a drawing of a Ukrainian soldier presenting the middle finger to the Russian cruiser.

==In popular culture==
The use of the middle finger has become pervasive in popular culture. The band Cobra Starship released a song called &quot;Middle Finger&quot;, and released a music video that showed people giving the finger. Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan installed a marble statue of a middle finger measuring , located directly in front of the Milan Stock Exchange. A now-famous photograph of Johnny Cash shows him giving the middle finger to a photographer during a 1969 concert at San Quentin State Prison, released as &quot;At San Quentin&quot;. However, the photo remained fairly obscure until 1998, when producer Rick Rubin made it the centerpiece of an ad in &quot;Billboard&quot; criticizing country radio for not giving airplay to Cash&#x27;s Grammy-winning album &quot;Unchained&quot;. Cameron Diaz made the gesture during a photo shoot for &quot;Esquire&quot;. Harold Lloyd shot the finger to his own reflection in a Coney Island funhouse after getting paint on his suit in &quot;Speedy&quot;, his final silent feature, from 1928.

Athletes, including Stefan Effenberg, Ron Artest, Luis Suárez, Virat Kohli, Juan Pablo Montoya, Iván Rodríguez, Danny Graves, Jack McDowell, Natasha Zvereva, Josh Smith, Bryan Cox, and Johnny Manziel have been suspended or fined for making the gesture. José Paniagua was released by the Chicago White Sox after giving the middle finger to an umpire; he never played in the majors again. Baseball executive Chub Feeney once resigned after giving the finger to fans on Fan Appreciation Night. Bud Adams, owner of the National Football League&#x27;s Tennessee Titans, was fined US$250,000 for giving both middle fingers to the fans of the Buffalo Bills during a game. Professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin is also famous for flashing one or both middle fingers as part of his gimmick. Hockey star Jaromír Jágr made the gesture several times following goals in the early 1990s.

The NME Awards, an annual music awards show in the UK, uses an extended middle finger design in the trophy handed out to the winners. Many musical artists, including Madonna, Lady Gaga, Eminem, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, and Adele have publicly made the gesture. Britney Spears and Iggy Azalea have given the gesture towards members of the paparazzi, but had to apologize when fans interpreted the gesture as directed at them. M.I.A. gave the gesture during the Super Bowl XLVI Halftime Show. The National Football League, NBC, and M.I.A. apologized. The CD itself for Kid Rock&#x27;s album &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; is a picture of his raised middle finger. On the cover of Moby Grape&#x27;s first album, &quot;Moby Grape&quot;, band member Don Stevenson was caught flipping the bird at the camera. The finger was airbrushed out of subsequent releases of the album.

In automobile driving culture, giving the finger to a fellow motorist communicates displeasure at another person&#x27;s reckless driving habits and/or their disregard for common courtesy.

The finger is included in Unicode as , part of the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs block.

The media sometimes refers to the gesture as being mistaken for an indication of &quot;we&#x27;re number one&quot;, typically indicated with a raised index finger. Sometimes, though, the &quot;mistake&quot; is actually an intentional euphemism meant to indirectly convey the gesture in a medium where a direct description would be inappropriate. For example, Don Meredith famously noted in a 1972 Monday Night Football game describing the finger of a dejected Houston Oilers fan: &quot;He thinks they&#x27;re number one in the nation.&quot; Ira Robbins, a law professor, believes the finger is no longer an obscene gesture. Psychologist David Walsh, founder of the National Institute on Media and the Family, sees the growing acceptance of the middle finger as a sign of the growth of a &quot;culture of disrespect&quot;.

Google Street View&#x27;s picture of the area around the Wisconsin Governor&#x27;s Mansion, taken in 2011 during the tenure of Scott Walker, shows a jogger giving the finger in the direction of the mansion.

==Similar gestures==
In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, the V sign, &quot;two-fingered salute&quot; or &quot;the fingers&quot;, when given with back of the hand towards the recipient, serves a similar purpose. According to a Royal Shakespeare Company synopsis of the play &quot;Henry V&quot;, a &quot;two-fingered salute&quot; appeared in the Macclesfield Psalter of (in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge), &quot;being made by a glove in the psalter&#x27;s marginalia&quot;. George H. W. Bush, former President of the United States, accidentally made the gesture while on a diplomatic trip to Australia.

In countries where Spanish, Portuguese or French are spoken, and especially in Spain, Portugal, Brazil and France, the gesture involving raising a fist and slapping the biceps on the same arm as the fist used, sometimes called the &quot;bras d&#x27;honneur&quot; (French), &quot;corte de mangas&quot; (Spanish), &quot;manguito&quot; (Portugal), &quot;dar uma banana&quot; (Brazil), or Iberian slap, is equivalent to the finger.

More commonly in Turkish or Slavic regions, the fig sign (also known as &quot;nah&quot; or &quot;shish&quot;) serves as the equivalent to the finger, meaning &quot;you won&#x27;t get it&quot; or &quot;in your dreams&quot;. The gesture is typically made with the hand and fingers curled and the thumb thrust between the middle and index fingers. This gesture is also used similarly in Indonesia, Turkey and China.

In Japanese Sign Language, this same gesture (with all fingers curled inward except the middle one) means the following: elder brother (hand moving up), younger brother (hand moving down), and siblings in general (one hand moving up, one moving down). This comes from a childish name of the middle finger, &quot;o-nii-san-yubi&quot; (&quot;big-brother finger&quot;), as opposed to &quot;o-tō-san-yubi&quot; (&quot;dad finger&quot;, the thumb), &quot;o-kā-san-yubi&quot; (&quot;mom finger&quot;, the index), &quot;o-nee-san-yubi&quot; (&quot;big-sister finger&quot;, the ring finger) and &quot;aka-chan-yubi&quot; (&quot;baby finger&quot;, the pinky). The equivalent words for sisters are expressed with the pinky. In the Japanese manual syllabary, the middle finger (with the front of the hand facing forward) stands for the kana せ (which, incidentally, is also an ).

<text>The president of Bolivia (), officially known as the president of the Plurinational State of Bolivia (), is head of state and head of government of Bolivia and the captain general of the Armed Forces of Bolivia.

According to the Bolivian Constitution, the president is elected by popular vote to a five-year term with no limit on the number of terms a president may serve. If no candidate wins a majority (defined as either more than 50%, or alternatively at least 40% and at least 10% more than the second-place candidate), the top two candidates advance to a runoff election.

Luis Arce is the 67th and incumbent president of Bolivia. He assumed office on 8 November 2020.

== Constitutional history ==
=== Establishment ===
On 6 August 1825, the Republic of Bolivia declared its independence and proclaimed Simón Bolívar head of state. While it is certainly true that Bolívar was the official ruler of the country starting from his arrival on 12 August, there exists conflict amongst scholars as to whether he should be considered the first president of the republic. According to the research of the Bolivian historian Isaac Sandoval, in his book &quot;Political development in the social formation of Bolivia&quot; it is affirmed that the first president of Bolivia was not Bolívar, but Antonio José de Sucre. This is due to the fact that Bolívar is never referred to as president in legal documents and was never sworn-in having renounced the title in favor of Sucre on 29 December 1825. Sucre, on the other hand, was president when the country&#x27;s first Constitution was promulgated on 19 November 1826.

Historian and author of the book &quot;Presidents of Bolivia: Between urns and rifles&quot; Carlos Mesa asserts that Bolívar was indeed the first president and that the lack of mention of him with the title is due to the fact the term &quot;president&quot; was not in common use in legal documents at the time. Mesa points to the Congressional decree of 11 August 1825 which proclaims Bolívar &quot;liberator&quot; granting him &quot;Supreme Executive Power of the Republic.&quot; Whatever the case, the position of Simón Bolívar as the first president is the most generally accepted stance.

The Political Constitution of 1826, also known as the Bolivarian Constitution, was the first constitutional text prepared by Simón Bolívar, sanctioned by the General Constituent Congress on 6 November 1826 and promulgated by Antonio José de Sucre on 19 November 1826. In this first instance, the presidency constituted a lifetime position with the power to elect and appoint a successor. The lifetime position was repealed during the presidency of Andrés de Santa Cruz who promulgated the Political Constitution of 1831. Instead, the president would serve for a four-year term of government with the ability to be reelected unlimitedly.

=== 2009 Political Constitution ===
The 2009 Political Constitution, approved by referendum on 25 January 2009 and promulgated by President Evo Morales on 7 February resulted in the official name of the country, leaving behind its previous denominative of &quot;Republic of Bolivia&quot; to become &quot;the Plurinational State of Bolivia&quot;. As such, Evo Morales was the 65th and last President of the Republic and the first President of the State. The Constitution extended the term of the president from four years to five years while keeping the two-term limit. On 21 February 2016, a proposal to abolish term limits failed to pass via constitutional referendum by a margin of 51% to 49%. Despite this, on 28 November 2017, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice ruled that all elected officials could run for office indefinitely, rather than for the two consecutive terms permitted under the 2009 Constitution. The court justified its decision based on the American Convention on Human Rights&#x27; interpretation of political rights.

Prior to 2009, if no candidate won more than half of the popular vote, the president was chosen by a vote in a joint legislative session from among the top two candidates (prior to 1995, the top three). This system led to multiple times in which the loser of the popular vote, once even the third place finisher, were elected president. This was replaced by a two-round system in which if no party won more than half of the popular vote in the first electoral round, the top two contenders would run in a runoff election.

== Incumbency ==

=== Vacancies and succession ===
Of the 67 people who have served as President of Bolivia, 13 (19%) died by tragic means, five died in office, and three died by assassination; Pedro Blanco Soto was shot while trying to escape custody, Agustín Morales was shot in self-defense after he attacked one of his military assistants, and Gualberto Villarroel was lynched outside the government palace. Germán Busch committed suicide and René Barrientos died in a helicopter crash; both deaths are rumored to have been planned assassinations. A further eight former presidents were assassinated in various ways after leaving office.

==== Line of succession ====
According to Article 169 I of the 2009 Constitution: &quot;In the event of an impediment or definitive absence of the president, he or she shall be replaced by the vice president and, in the absence of the latter, by the president of the Senate, and in his or her absence by the president of the Chamber of Deputies. In this last case, new elections shall be called within a maximum period of 90 days.

Historically there have been multiple periods of time during different constitutions in which the office of vice president has been rendered nonexistent and more still in which the office was vacant. Between 26 October 1839 and 15 February 1878, the office of vice president was abolished with the president of the Senate being the first in the line of succession. During this time, Eusebio Guilarte and Tomás Frías Ametller both came to power in their capacity as President of the Council of State.

==== Interim president ====
Rather than complete the previous president&#x27;s term, interim presidents have held office until new elections could be held even if that period of time runs past or cuts short the previous president&#x27;s term. José María Pérez de Urdininea, Felipe Segundo Guzmán, Carlos Blanco Galindo, Carlos Quintanilla, Néstor Guillén, Tomás Monje, Wálter Guevara, Lidia Gueiler Tejada, Eduardo Rodríguez and most recently Jeanine Áñez all came to power as interim presidents due to the fact the previous president had resigned, been deposed, died, or otherwise left office and new elections had to be held to elect a valid successor.

José Miguel de Velasco Franco was initially the acting president in the absence of Andrés de Santa Cruz but became interim president due to the fact Santa Cruz never arrived to be sworn-in, forcing a new president to have to be elected by Congress.

==== Acting president ====
In the case of temporary incapacity or absence from the country, the title of Acting President () is transferred to lower officials according to the order of presidential succession. In September 2012, Senate president Gabriela Montaño became the first woman to assume this office, during the presidency of Evo Morales. José Miguel de Velasco Franco, Mariano Enrique Calvo, and Pedro José Domingo de Guerra were acting presidents for particularly long periods of time of multiple months or, in the case of Enrique Calvo, multiple years.

=== Residence ===

The Palacio Quemado, in English &quot;Burnt Palace,&quot; in the legal capital of La Paz was the official residence of the president of Bolivia from 1853 to 2018. Its nickname originates from the fact that it was set aflame and burned almost to the ground when rebels in opposition to Tomás Frías Ametller failed to storm it and instead opted to light it on fire in 1875. It has since been rebuilt and redecorated a number of times, but the name stuck. At the end of 2018, it ceased to function as the headquarters of the government offices, with plans to turn it instead into a museum. Briefly occupied again from 2019 to 2020, it has since returned to being a museum.

In 2018, the official residence of the president was moved by President Evo Morales to the Casa Grande del Pueblo, known in English as the &quot;Great House of the People&quot;, replacing the Palacio Quemado as the seat of the Executive Branch of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. Inaugurated on 9 August 2018, the building houses the president as well as various government ministries. In 2019, Interim President Jeanine Áñez refused to use the new building and returned operations to the Palacio Quemado, though the ministries and other government offices continued to operate within the new building. The Casa Grande returned to being the residence of the president upon the inauguration of Luis Arce on 8 November 2020.

=== Travel ===

The transportation of the president of Bolivia is the charge of the Bolivian Presidential Air Group, for the transportation of the president at the national short-range level the EC145 helicopter is used, for national and international transportation the Falcon 900EX EASY aircraft is used, both manufactured by Dassault Aviation (France) that make up part of the Bolivian Air Force&#x27;s aircraft.

=== Protection ===
The Presidential Bodyguard is made up of the 1st Bolivian Colorados infantry regiment, which is a military unit of the Bolivian Army whose specific mission is to protect the security and physical integrity of the president of Bolivia and whose charge is the custody of the Palace of Government and the Casa Grande, as well as other properties of the presidency.

It has two infantry battalions, the BI-201 and BI-202, with their respective barracks, both located in the city of La Paz. The &quot;Calama headquarters&quot; is located on the street on the same name where the unit&#x27;s headquarters and the regimental barracks and training depot operate and the Mirador barracks with a seat on the Quilli Quilli hill. The Villa Pavón area is a training center in various areas of specialization such as assault, support, protection of people, first aid, etc. There are also bedrooms in the Casa Grande del Pueblo for the soldiers who watch and stand guard at the government palace at night.

== Political history ==

Since its independence in 1825, Bolivia has been ruled by key figures in the fight for independence, leaders of the War of the Pacific, representatives of the aristocracy, military dictators and democratically elected leaders. Due to the complexities in the rise to power of these individuals, in Bolivia presidents are divided between two groups. The first are what are classified as &quot;Constitucionales&quot; having come to power legally or through quasi-legal means (achieving power through a revolution or coup d&#x27;état but later constitutionalised). The rest are known as de facto presidents, having come to power militarily and never constitutionalised. A third category belongs to interim presidents, placed in power only until a new president is chosen. Interim presidents have historically been both constitutional or de facto depending on the legality of their rise to the office.

Throughout Bolivian history, there have been six periods of time in 1839, 1841, 1848, 1879–1880, and most recently in 2019 in which there has been no head of state. Seven governments were made up of triumvirates: 1861, 1899, 1920–1921, 1970, 1978, 1981, and 1982. For one month in 1928, Hernando Siles Reyes&#x27; cabinet ruled the country being the only time when a constituted government was not presided over by an agent. In 1965, faced with discontent from loyalists of Alfredo Ovando Candía, President René Barrientos established the co-presidency between himself and Ovando on 26 May 1965. This is the only example of two presidents ruling at once in Bolivian history and it lasted until 2 January 1966 when Barrientos resigned to run for president in the upcoming general elections.

In 1983, a poll was taken by &quot;Última Hora&quot; newspaper to determine which seven historical presidents were regarded as most significant. The &quot;winners&quot; were Antonio José de Sucre, Andrés de Santa Cruz, Manuel Isidoro Belzu, Mariano Melgarejo, Aniceto Arce, Ismael Montes, and Víctor Paz Estenssoro. 
Sucre oversaw the early developments of the country with the promulgation of the Political Constitution of 1826. Andrés de Santa Cruz oversaw the unification of Bolivia with Peru to become the Peru-Bolivian Confederation in 1836. His term as Supreme Protector of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation saw the height of the political power of Bolivia on the South American continent though it would ultimately end in failure and the separation of the two states. Manuel Isidoro Belzu was perhaps amongst the most populist Bolivian presidents, attempting to modernize the country through division of wealth. The dictatorship of Mariano Melgarejo saw brutal repression of opposition and Bolivia&#x27;s indigenous population. Following the War of the Pacific, Aniceto Arce and Ismael Montes would respectivaley become influential leaders in the Conservative and Liberal eras. Víctor Paz Estenssoro led the 1952 National Revolution and founded the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) which heavily influenced Bolivian politics in the second half of the 20th century.

=== Indigenous presidents ===
Evo Morales is described as the first indigenous president of Bolivia in academic studies of his presidency, such as those of Muñoz-Pogossian, Webber, Philip and Panizza, and Farthing and Kohl, as well as in press reports, such as those of BBC News. However, there have been challenges to this claim by critics who have asserted that Morales probably has some European ancestry, and thus on genetic grounds is technically &quot;mestizo&quot; rather than solely indigenous. Further, former president Enrique Peñaranda was of substantially indigenous origin while Andrés de Santa Cruz, was of Aymara and Inca lineage. Harten asserted that this argument was &quot;misguided[,] wrong[... and] above all irrelevant&quot; because regardless of his genetic makeup, the majority of Bolivians perceive Morales as being the first indigenous president. In Bolivian society, indigeneity is a fluid concept rooted in cultural identity; for instance, many indigenous individuals that have settled in urban areas and abandoned their traditional rural customs have come to identify as &quot;mestizo&quot;.

=== Women presidents ===
Two women have served as presidents of the country. Lidia Gueiler Tejada became the first female president of Bolivia (second in the history of the Americas) on 16 November 1979 following a brief coup by Alberto Natusch. Jeanine Añez was the second and most recent female president from 12 November 2019 to 8 November 2020. Both women came to power in similar ways, taking office on an interim basis as members of Congress. As of yet, however, no woman has been elected president by popular vote in Bolivian history.

<text>Sir Charles Hallé (born Karl Halle; 11 April 181925 October 1895) was a Prussian and British pianist and conductor. In 1858, he founded the Hallé Orchestra.

==Life==

Charles Frederick Hallé was born Carl Friederich Halle on 10 April 1819 in Hagen, Westphalia, Kingdom of Prussia and baptized on 11 April 1819, a son of Friederich Halle and Fr. Caroline Brenscheid. After settling permanently in England in 1848, he changed his name to Charles Frederick Hallé.

His first lessons were from his father, an organist. As a child he showed remarkable gifts for pianoforte playing. He performed a sonatina in public at the age of four, and played percussion in the orchestra in his early years. In August 1828 he took part in a concert at Cassel, where he attracted the notice of Spohr.

He then studied under Christian Heinrich Rinck at Darmstadt, Germany in 1835, and as early as 1836 went to Paris, where for twelve years he often associated with Luigi Cherubini, Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt and other musicians, and enjoyed the friendship of such great literary figures as Alfred de Musset and George Sand. He visited England briefly in 1843. He taught, and also started a set of chamber concerts with Jean-Delphin Alard and Auguste Franchomme with great success. His students included the composer Jane Roeckel.

He had completed one series of them when the revolution of 1848 drove him from Paris, and he settled in England, with his first wife and two children, in London.

He conducted elsewhere in the country also, as well as performing as a pianist. He was the first pianist to play the complete series of Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas in England. Hallé&#x27;s piano recitals, given at first from 1850 in his own house, and from 1861 in St James&#x27;s Hall, Piccadilly, were an important feature of London musical life, and it was due in great measure to them that a knowledge of Beethoven&#x27;s pianoforte sonatas became general in English society.

Hallé was also the inventor of a mechanical page-turner for pianists. The pages were preset in the device, and the player would turn each page by means of a foot-mechanism. &quot;People would go to his concerts just to see the spectacle of leaf after leaf turning over, ghostlike, without the intervention of human hands.&quot;

At the Musical Union founded by John Ella, and at the Popular Concerts from their beginning, Hallé was a frequent performer.

He moved to Manchester in 1849 to direct Manchester&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Concerts, which had its own orchestra and in May 1857 was asked to put together a small orchestra to play for Prince Albert at the opening ceremony of the Art Treasures of Great Britain, the biggest single exhibition Manchester had ever hosted. Hallé accepted the challenge and was so happy with the results that he kept the group together until October, forming the fledgling Hallé Orchestra.

He then started a series of concerts of his own, raising the orchestra to a pitch of perfection quite unknown in England at that time. Hallé decided to continue working with the orchestra as a formal organisation, and it gave its first concert under those auspices on 30 January 1858.

The orchestra&#x27;s first home was the Free Trade Hall. By 1861 the orchestra was in financial trouble (it performed only two concerts that year), but has survived under a series of accomplished conductors.
In 1888, Hallé was married for a second time to the violinist Wilma Neruda, widow of Ludvig Norman and daughter of Josef Neruda, members of whose family had long been famous for musical talent. The same year, he was knighted.

In 1890 and 1891 he toured with his wife in Australia and elsewhere. In 1891, he also helped to found the Royal Manchester College of Music, serving as head and chief professor of pianoforte.

He died in Manchester on 25 October 1895, and was buried in Weaste Cemetery, Salford. Lady Hallé, who from 1864 was one of the leading solo violinists of the time, was constantly associated with her husband on the concert stage until his death.

==Family==
He was twice married: first, on 11 November 1841, to Desirée Smith de Rilieu, who died in 1866; and, secondly, on 26 July 1888, to Madame Wilma Neruda, the distinguished violinist. Charles Edward Hallé, his son by his first wife, became a painter and gallery manager whilst his daughter, Elinor Hallé CBE, was a sculptor and inventor.

<doc id="188824" wikidata="Q144964" url="?curid=188824" title="Thracians">
<text>The Thracians (; ; ) were an Indo-European speaking people who inhabited large parts of Southeast Europe in ancient history. Thracians resided mainly in Southeast Europe in modern-day Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, northern Greece and European Turkey, but also in north-western Anatolia (Asia Minor) in Turkey.

The exact origin of the Thracians is uncertain, but it is believed that Thracians like other Indo-European speaking groups in Europe descended from a mixture of Proto-Indo-Europeans and Early European Farmers.

Around the 5th millennium BC, the inhabitants of the eastern region of the Balkans became organized in different groups of indigenous people that were later named by the ancient Greeks under the single ethnonym of &quot;Thracians&quot;.

The Thracian culture emerged during the early Bronze Age, which began about 3500 BC. From it also developed the Getae, the Dacians and other regional groups of tribes. Historical and archaeological records indicate that the Thracian culture flourished in the 3rd and 2nd millennium BC. Writing in the 6th century BC, Xenophanes described Thracians as &quot;blue-eyed and red-haired&quot;.

According to Greek and Roman historians, the Thracians were uncivilized and remained largely disunited, until the establishment of their first permanent state the Odrysian kingdom in the very beginning of 5th century BC, founded by king Teres I, exploiting the collapse of the Persian presence in Europe due to failed invasion of Greece in 480–79. Teres and his son Sitalces pursued a policy of expansion, making the kingdom one of the most powerful of its time. Throughout much of its early history it remained an ally of Athens and even joined the Peloponnesian War on its side. By 400 BC the state showed first signs of fatigue, although the skilled Cotys I initiated a brief renaissance that lasted until his murder in 360 BC. In the late 4th century BC around 340 BC the Odrysian kingdom lost independence to Macedon, becoming incorporated into the empire, but it regained independence following Alexander the Great&#x27;s death. A much smaller Odrysian state was revived in around 330 BC by Seuthes III, who founded a new capital named Seuthopolis.

The Thracians faced gradual conquest by the Romans from the mid 2nd century BC under whom they faced internal strife. They composed major parts of rebellions against the Romans along with the Macedonians until the Third Macedonian War. Beginning in 73 BC, Spartacus, a Thracian warrior from the Maedi tribe who was enslaved as a gladiator by the Romans, led a revolt that posed a significant challenge to Roman authority, prompting a series of military campaigns against it. The aftermath of the rebellion saw the crucifixion of 6,000 surviving rebels along the Appian Way. The Odrysian kingdom was attacked by the Roman Republic in the late 1st century BC, when the Odrysian heartlands eventually became known as the Sapaean kingdom, a client state of the Roman Republic, which was finally abolished and converted into a Roman province of Thracia in 45-46 AD.

Thracians were described as &quot;warlike&quot; and &quot;barbarians&quot; by the Greeks and Romans since they were neither Romans nor Greeks but in spite of that they were favored as excellent mercenaries. While the Thracians were perceived as unsophisticated by the Romans and Greeks, their culture was reportedly noted for its sophisticated poetry and music. Since the 19th century-early 20th century, Bulgaria and Romania have used archaeology to learn more about Thracian culture and way of life.

Thracians followed a polytheistic religion with monotheistic elements. One of their customs was tattooing, common among both men and women. The Thracians culturally interacted with the peoples surrounding them – Greeks, Persians, Scythians and Celts Thracians spoke the now extinct Thracian language and shared a common culture. The last reported use of a Thracian language was by monks in the 6th century AD. The scientific study of the Thracians is known as Thracology.

==Etymology==
The first historical record of the ethnonym &quot;Thracian&quot; is found in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, where the Thracians are described as allies of the Trojans in the Trojan War against the Ancient Greeks. The ethnonym &quot;Thracian&quot; comes from Ancient Greek (; plural Θρᾷκες, ) or Θρᾴκιος (; Ionic: Θρηίκιος, ), and the toponym Thrace comes from Θρᾴκη (; Ionic: Θρῄκη, ). These forms are all exonyms as applied by the Greeks.

==Mythological foundation==

In Greek mythology, &quot;Thrax&quot; (his name simply the quintessential Thracian) was regarded as one of the reputed sons of the god Ares. In the &quot;Alcestis&quot;, Euripides mentions that one of the names of Ares himself was &quot;Thrax&quot;. Since Ares was regarded as the patron of Thrace his golden or gilded shield was kept in his temple at Bistonia in Thrace.

==Origins==
The origins of the Thracians remain obscure due to the absence of written historical records before they made contact with the Greeks. Evidence of proto-Thracians in the prehistoric period depends on artifacts of material culture. Leo Klejn identifies proto-Thracians with the multi-cordoned ware culture that was pushed away from Ukraine by the advancing timber grave culture or Srubnaya. It is generally proposed that a Thracian people developed from a mixture of indigenous peoples and Indo-Europeans from the time of Proto-Indo-European expansion in the Early Bronze Age when the latter, around 1500 BC, mixed with indigenous peoples. According to one theory, their ancestors migrated in three waves from the northeast: the first in the Late Neolithic, forcing out the Pelasgians and Achaeans, the second in the Early Bronze Age, and the third around 1200 BC. They reached the Aegean islands, ending the Mycenaean civilization. They did not speak the same language. The lack of written archeological records left by Thracians suggests that the diverse topography did not make it possible for a single language to form.

Ancient Greek and Roman historians agreed that the ancient Thracians were superior fighters; only their constant political fragmentation prevented them from overrunning the lands around the northeastern Mediterranean. Although these historians characterized the Thracians as &quot;primitive&quot; partly because they lived in simple, open villages, the Thracians in fact had a fairly advanced culture that was especially noted for its poetry and music. Their soldiers were valued as mercenaries, particularly by the Macedonians and Romans.

==Identity and distribution==


Thracians inhabited parts of the ancient provinces of Thrace, Moesia, Macedonia, Beotia, Attica, Dacia, Scythia Minor, Sarmatia, Bithynia, Mysia, Pannonia, and other regions of the Balkans and Anatolia. This area extended over most of the Balkans region, and the Getae north of the Danube as far as beyond the Bug and including Pannonia in the west.

According to &quot;Ethnica&quot;, a geographical dictionary by Stephanus of Byzantium, Thrace—the land of the Thracians—was known as Perki (Περκη) and Aria (Αρια) before being named Thrace by the Greeks, presumably due to the affiliation of the Thracians with the god Ares and Perki is the reflexive name of the god Ares as *Perkʷūnos.Thucydides mentions about a period in the past, from his point of view, when Thracians had inhabited the region of Phocis, also known as the location of Delphi. He dates it to the lifetime of Tereus – mythological Thracian king and son of the god Ares.

Due to the lack of historical records that predate Classical Greece it&#x27;s presumed that the Thracians did not manage to form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the 5th century BC. In the 1st century BC, during King Burebista&#x27;s rule, emerged the powerful state of Dacia.

Currently, there are about 200 identified Thracian tribes. The most prominent tribe, the Moesi achieved significant importance during Roman rule. What&#x27;s notable about the Moesians is that they practiced vegetarianism, feeding themselves on honey, milk, and cheese.

== Greek and Roman descriptions ==
Thracians were regarded by ancient Greeks and Romans as warlike, ferocious, bloodthirsty, and barbarian. Plato in his &quot;Republic&quot; groups them with the Scythians, calling them extravagant and high spirited; and in his &quot;Laws&quot; portrays them as a warlike nation, grouping them with Celts, Persians, Scythians, Iberians and Carthaginians. Polybius wrote of Cotys&#x27;s sober and gentle character being unlike that of most Thracians. Tacitus in his &quot;Annals&quot; writes of them being wild, savage and impatient, disobedient even to their own kings. The Thracians have been said to have &quot;tattooed their bodies, obtained their wives by purchase, and often sold their children&quot;. The French historian Victor Duruy further notes that they &quot;considered husbandry unworthy of a warrior, and knew no source of gain but war and theft&quot;. He also states that they practiced human sacrifice, which has been confirmed by archaeological evidence.Polyaenus and Strabo write how the Thracians broke their pacts of truce with trickery. Polyaneus testifies that the Thracians struck their weapons against each other before battle, &quot;in the Thracian manner&quot;. Diegylis, leader of the Caeni, was considered one of the most bloodthirsty chieftains by Diodorus Siculus. An Athenian club for lawless youths was named after the thracian tribe Triballi which might be the origin of the word tribe.

According to ancient Roman sources, the Dii were responsible for the worst atrocities in the Peloponnesian War, killing every living thing, including children and dogs in Tanagra and Mycalessos. The Dii would impale Roman heads on their spears and rhomphaias such as in the Kallinikos skirmish at 171 BC. Strabo treated the Thracians as barbarians, and held that they spoke the same language as the Getae. Some Roman authors noted that even after the introduction of Latin they still kept their &quot;barbarous&quot; ways. Herodotus writes that &quot;the thracians sell their children and let their maidens commerce with whatever men they please&quot;.

The accuracy and impartiality of these descriptions have been called into question in modern times, given the seeming embellishments in Herodotus&#x27;s histories, for one. Archaeologists have attempted to piece together a fuller understanding of Thracian culture through the study of their artifacts.

==Physical appearance==

Several Thracian graves or tombstones have the name &quot;Rufus&quot; inscribed on them, meaning &quot;redhead&quot; – a common name given to people with red hair which led to associating the name with slaves when the Romans enslaved this particular group. Ancient Greek artwork often depicts Thracians as redheads. Rhesus of Thrace, a mythological Thracian king, was so named because of his red hair and is depicted on Greek pottery as having red hair and a red beard.
Ancient Greek writers also described the Thracians as red-haired. A fragment by the Greek poet Xenophanes describes the Thracians as blue-eyed and red haired:

Bacchylides described Theseus as wearing a hat with red hair, which classicists believe was Thracian in origin. Other ancient writers who described the hair of the Thracians as red include Hecataeus of Miletus, Galen, Clement of Alexandria, and Julius Firmicus Maternus.
Nevertheless, academic studies have concluded that people often had different physical features from those described by primary sources. Ancient authors described as red-haired several groups of people. They claimed that all Slavs had red hair, and likewise described the Scythians as red haired. According to Beth Cohen, Thracians had &quot;the same dark hair and the same facial features as the Ancient Greeks.&quot; However, Aris N. Poulianos states that Thracians, like modern Bulgarians, belonged mainly to the Aegean anthropological type.

==History==
=== Homeric period ===
The earliest known mention of Thracians is in the second song of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, where the population inhabiting the Thracian Chersonesus is said to have participated in the Trojan War, which is believed to have taken place around 12th century BC. This population is referred to with the following name:

&quot;...And Hippothous led the tribes of the Pelasgi, that rage with the spear, even them that dwelt in deep-soiled Larisa; these were led by Hippothous and Pylaeus, scion of Ares, sons twain of Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus. But the Thracians Acamas led and Peirous, the warrior, even all them that the strong stream of the Hellespont encloseth.&quot;&quot;&quot;

===Archaic period===
The first Greek colonies along the Thracian coasts (first the Aegean, then the Marmara and Black Seas) were founded in the 8th century BC. Thracians and Greeks lived side-by-side. Ancient sources record a Thracian presence on the Aegean islands and in &quot;Hellas&quot; (the broader &quot;land of the Hellenes&quot;).

At some point in the 7th century BC, a portion of the Thracian Treres tribe migrated across the Thracian Bosporus and invaded Anatolia. In 637 BC, the Treres under their king Kobos ( ; ), in alliance with the Cimmerians and the Lycians, attacked the kingdom of Lydia during the seventh year of the reign of the Lydian king Ardys. They defeated the Lydians and captured the capital city of Lydia, Sardis, except for its citadel, and Ardys might have been killed in this attack. Ardys&#x27;s son and successor, Sadyattes, might possibly also have been killed in another Cimmerian attack on Lydia. Soon after 635 BC, with Assyrian approval the Scythians under Madyes entered Anatolia. In alliance with Sadyattes&#x27;s son, the Lydian king Alyattes, Madyes expelled the Treres from Asia Minor and defeated the Cimmerians so that they no longer constituted a threat again, following which the Scythians extended their domination to Central Anatolia until they were themselves expelled by the Medes from Western Asia in the 600s BC.

==== Achaemenid Thrace ====

In the 6th century BC the Persian Achaemenid Empire conquered Thrace, starting in 513 BC, when the Achaemenid king Darius I amassed an army and marched from Achaemenid-ruled Anatolia into Thrace, and from there he crossed the Arteskos river and then proceeded through the valley-route of the Hebros river. This was an act of conquest by Darius I, who sought to create a new satrapy in the Balkans, and had during his march sent emissaries to the Thracians found on the path of his army as well as to the many other Thracian tribes over a wide area. All these peoples of Thrace, including the Odrysae, submitted to the Achaemenid king until his army reached the territory of Thracian tribe of the Getae who lived just south of the Danube river and who in vain attempted to resist the Achaemenid conquest. After the resistance of the Getae was defeated and they were forced to provide the Achaemenid army with soldiers, all the Thracian tribes between the Aegean Sea and the Danube river had been subjected by the Achaemenid Empire. Once Darius had reached the Danube, he crossed the river and campaigned against the Scythians, after which he returned to Anatolia through Thrace and left a large army in Europe under the command of his general Megabazus.

Following Darius I&#x27;s orders to create a new satrapy for the Achaemenid Empire in the Balkans, Megabazus forced the Greek cities who had refused to submit to the Achaemenid Empire, starting with Perinthus, after which led military campaigns throughout Thrace to impose Achaemenid rule over every city and tribe in the area. With the help of Thracian guides, Megabazus was able to conquer Paeonia up to but not including the area of Lake Prasias, and he gave the lands of the Paeonians inhabiting these regions up to the Lake Prasias to Thracians loyal to the Achaemenid Empire. The last endeavours of Megabazus included his the conquest of the area between the Strymon and Axius rivers, and at the end of his campaign, the king of Macedonia, Amyntas I, accepted to become a vassal of the Achaemenid Empire. Within the satrapy itself, the Achaemenid king Darius granted to the tyrant Histiaeus of Miletus the district of Myrcinus on the Strymon&#x27;s east bank until Megabazus persuaded him to recall Histiaeus after he returned to Asia Minor, after which the Thracian tribe of the Edoni retook control of Myrcinus. The new satrapy, once created, was named  (), derived from Scythian the name , which was the self-designation of the Scythians who inhabited the northern parts of the satrapy. Once Megabazus had returned to Asia Minor, he was succeeded in by a governor whose name is unknown, and Darius appointed the general Otanes to oversee the administrative division of the Hellespont, which extended on both sides of the sea and included the Bosporus, the Propontis, and the Hellespont proper and its approaches. Otanes then proceeded to capture Byzantium, Chalcedon, Antandrus, Lamponeia, Imbros, and Lemnos for the Achaemenid Empire.The area included within the satrapy of included both the Aegean coast of Thrace, as well as its Pontic coast till the Danube. In the interior, the Western border of the satrapy consisted of the Axius river and the Belasica-Pirin-Rila mountain ranges till the site of modern-day Kostenets. The importance of this satrapy rested in that it contained the Hebros river, where a route in the river valley connected the permanent Persian settlement of Doriscus with the Aegean coast, as well as with the port-cities of Apollonia, Mesembria and Odessos on the Black Sea, and with the central Thracian plain, which gave this region an important strategic value. Persian sources describe the province as being populated by three groups: the &quot;Saka Paradraya&quot; (&quot;Saka beyond the sea&quot;, the Persian term for all Scythian peoples to the north of the Caspian and Black Seas ); the themselves (most likely the Thracian tribes), and &quot;Yauna Takabara&quot;. The latter term, which translates as &quot;Ionians with shield-like hats&quot;, is believed to refer to Macedonians. The three ethnicities (Saka, Macedonian, Thracian) enrolled in the Achaemenid army, as shown in the Imperial tomb reliefs of Naqsh-e Rostam, and participated in the Second Persian invasion of Greece on the Achaemenid side.

When Achaemenid control over its European possessions collapsed once the Ionian Revolt started, the Thracians did not help the Greek rebels, and they instead saw Achaemenid rule as more favourable because the latter had treated the Thracians with favour and even given them more land, and also because they realised that Achaemenid rule was a bulwark against Greek expansion and Scythian attacks. During the revolt, Aristagoras of Miletus captured Myrcinus from the Edones and died trying to attack another Thracian city.

Once the Ionian Revolt had been fully quelled, the Achaemenid general Mardonius crossed the Hellespont with a large fleet and army, re-subjugated Thrace without any effort and made Macedonia full part of the satrapy of . Mardonius was however attacked at night by the Bryges in the area of Lake Doiran and modern-day Valandovo, but he was able to defeat and submit them as well. Herodotus&#x27;s list of tribes who provided the Achaemenid army with soldiers included Thracians from both the coast and from the central Thracian plain, attesting that Mardonius&#x27;s campaign had reconquered all the Thracian areas which were under Achaemenid rule before the Ionian Revolt.

When the Greeks defeated a second invasion attempt by the Persian Empire in 479 BC, they started attacking the satrapy of , which was resisted by both the Thracians and the Persian forces. The Thracians kept on sending supplies to the governor of Eion when the Greeks besieged it. When the city fell to the Greeks in 475 BC, Cimon gave its land to Athens for colonisation. Although Athens was now in control of the Aegean Sea and the Hellespont following the defeat of the Persian invasion, the Persians were still able to control the southern coast of Thrace from a base in central Thrace and with the support of the Thracians. Thanks to the Thracians co-operating with the Persians by sending supplies and military reinforcements down the Hebrus river route, Achaemenid authority in central Thrace lasted until around 465 BC, and the governor Mascames managed to resist many Greek attacks in Doriscus until then.

Around this time, Teres I, the king of the Odrysae tribe, in whose territory the Hebrus flowed, was starting to organise the rise of his kingdom into a powerful state. With the end of Achaemenid power in the Balkans, the Thracian Odrysian kingdom, the Kingdom of Macedonia, and the Athenian thalassocracy filled the ensuing power vacuum and formed their own spheres of influence in the area.

====Odrysian Kingdom====

The Odrysian Kingdom was a state union of over 40 Thracian tribes and 22 kingdoms that existed between the 5th century BC and the 1st century AD. It consisted mainly of present-day Bulgaria, spreading to parts of Southeastern Romania (Northern Dobruja), parts of Northern Greece and parts of modern-day European Turkey.

By the 5th century BC, the Thracian population was large enough that Herodotus called them the second-most numerous people in the part of the world known by him (after the Indians), and potentially the most powerful, if not for their lack of unity. The Thracians in classical times were broken up into a large number of groups and tribes, though a number of powerful Thracian states were organized, the most important being the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace, and also the short lived Dacian kingdom of Burebista. The &quot;peltast is&quot; a type of soldier of this period that originated in Thrace.

At this time, a subculture of celibate ascetics called the &quot;ctistae&quot; lived in Thrace, where they served as philosophers, priests and prophets. They were held in a place of honor by the Thracians, with their lives being dedicated to the gods.

====Macedonian Thrace====
During this period, contacts between the Thracians and Classical Greece intensified.

After the Persians withdrew from Europe and before the expansion of the Kingdom of Macedon, Thrace was divided into three regions (east, central, and west). A notable ruler of the East Thracians was Cersobleptes, who attempted to expand his authority over many of the Thracian tribes. He was eventually defeated by the Macedonians.

The Thracians were typically not city-builders and their only polis was Seuthopolis.

The conquest of the southern part of Thrace by Philip II of Macedon in the 4th century BC made the Odrysian kingdom extinct for several years. After the kingdom was reestablished, it was a vassal state of Macedon for several decades under generals such as Lysimachus of the Diadochi.

In 336 BC, Alexander the Great began recruiting thracian cavalry and javelin men in his army, who accompnied him on his continuous conquest to expand the borders of the Macedonian Empire. The strength of the thracian cavalry quickly grew from 150 men, to 1000 men by the time Alexander advanced into Egypt, and numbered 1600 when he reached the persian city of Susa. The thracian infantry was under the command of the Odrysian prince Sitalces II who led them in the siege of Telmissus and in the battles of Issus and Gaugamela.

In 279 BC, Celtic Gauls advanced into Macedonia, southern Greece and Thrace. They were soon forced out of Macedonia and southern Greece, but they remained in Thrace until the end of the 3rd century BC. From Thrace, three Celtic tribes advanced into Anatolia and established the kingdom of Galatia.

In western parts of Moesia, Celts (Scordisci) and Thracians lived alongside each other, as evident from the archaeological findings of pits and treasures, spanning from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century BC.

===Greek raids to enslave Thracians===
Slave raids were a specific form of banditry that was the primary method employed by the ancient Greeks for gathering slaves. In regions such as Thrace and the eastern Aegean, natives, or &quot;barbarians&quot;, captured in these raids were the main source of slaves, rather than prisoners of war. As described by Xenophon, and Menander in Aspis, after the slaves were captured in raids, their actual enslavement took place when they were resold through slave-dealers to Athenians and other slaveowners throughout Greece. The fragmentary list of slaves confiscated from the property of the mutilators of the Hermai mentions 32 slaves whose origins have been ascertained: 13 came from Thrace, 7 from Caria, and the others came from Cappadocia, Scythia, Phrygia, Lydia, Syria, Ilyria, Macedon, and Peloponnese. The names given to slaves in the comedies often had a geographical link, thus Thratta, used by Aristophanes in The Wasps, The Acharnians, and Peace, simply meant a Thracian woman. The ethnicity of a slave was a significant criterion for major purchasers: Ancient practice was to avoid a concentration of too many slaves of the same ethnic origin in the same place, in order to limit the risk of revolt.

====Roman Thrace====
During the Macedonian Wars, conflict between Rome and Thrace was unavoidable. The rulers of Macedonia were weak, and Thracian tribal authority resurged. But after the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC, Roman authority over Macedonia seemed inevitable, and the governance of Thrace passed to Rome.

Initially, Thracians and Macedonians revolted against Roman rule. For example, the revolt of Andriscus, in 149 BC, drew the bulk of its support from Thrace. Incursions by local tribes into Macedonia continued for many years, though a few tribes, such as the Deneletae and the Bessi, willingly allied with Rome.

After the Third Macedonian War, Thrace acknowledged Roman authority. The client state of Thracia comprised several tribes.
The next century and a half saw the slow development of Thracia into a permanent Roman client state. The Sapaei tribe came to the forefront initially under the rule of Rhascuporis. He was known to have granted assistance to both Pompey and Caesar, and later supported the Republican armies against Mark Antony and Octavian in the final days of the Republic.

The heirs of Rhascuporis became as deeply enmeshed in political scandal and murder as were their Roman masters. A series of royal assassinations altered the ruling landscape for several years in the early Roman imperial period. Various factions took control with the support of the Roman Emperor. The turmoil would eventually end with one final assassination.

After Rhoemetalces III of the Thracian Kingdom of Sapes was murdered in AD 46 by his wife, Thracia was incorporated as an official Roman province to be governed by Procurators, and later Praetorian prefects. The central governing authority of Rome was in Perinthus, but regions within the province were under the command of military subordinates to the governor. The lack of large urban centers made Thracia a difficult place to manage, but eventually the province flourished under Roman rule. However, Romanization was not attempted in the province of Thracia. The &quot;Balkan Sprachbund&quot; does not support Hellenization.

Roman authority in Thracia rested mainly with the legions stationed in Moesia. The rural nature of Thracia&#x27;s populations, and distance from Roman authority, certainly inspired local troops to support Moesia&#x27;s legions. Over the next few centuries, the province was periodically and increasingly attacked by migrating Germanic tribes. The reign of Justinian saw the construction of over 100 legionary fortresses to supplement the defense.

==Aftermath==

The ancient languages of these people and their cultural influence were highly reduced due to the repeated invasions of the Balkans by Romans, Celts, Huns, Goths, Scythians, Sarmatians and Slavs, accompanied by, hellenization, romanization and later slavicisation. However, the Thracians as a group only disappeared in the Early Middle Ages. Towards the end of the 4th century, Nicetas the Bishop of Remesiana brought the gospel to &quot;those mountain wolves&quot;, the Bessi. Reportedly his mission was successful, and the worship of Dionysus and other Thracian gods was eventually replaced by Christianity.

In 570, Antoninus Placentius said that in the valleys of Mount Sinai there was a monastery in which the monks spoke Greek, Latin, Syriac, Egyptian and Bessian. The origin of the monasteries is explained in a medieval hagiography written by Simeon Metaphrastes, in Vita Sancti Theodosii Coenobiarchae in which he wrote that Theodosius the Cenobiarch founded on the shore of the Dead Sea a monastery with four churches, in each being spoken a different language, among which Bessian was found. The place where the monasteries were founded was called &quot;Cutila&quot;, which may be a Thracian name.

The further fate of the Thracians is a matter of dispute. German historian Gottfried Schramm speculated that the Albanians derived from the Christianized Thracian tribe Bessi, after their remnants were allegedly pushed by Slavs and Bulgars during the 9th century westwards into modern day Albania. However, archaeologically, there is absolutely no evidence of a 9th-century migration of any population, such as the Bessi, from western Bulgaria to Albania. Also from a linguistic point of view it emerges that the Thracian-Bessian hypothesis of the origin of Albanian should be rejected, since only very little comparative linguistic material is available (the Thracian is attested only marginally, while the Bessian is completely unknown), but at the same time the individual phonetic history of Albanian and Thracian clearly indicates a very different sound development that cannot be considered as the result of one language. Furthermore, the Christian vocabulary of Albanian is mainly Latin, which speaks against the construct of a &quot;Thracian-Bessian church language&quot;. Most probably the Thracians were assimilated into the Roman and later in the Byzantine society and became part of the ancestral groups of the modern Southeastern Europeans.

Oddly the last mention of Thracians, in the 6th century, coincides with the first mention of Slavs, when the Slavic tribes inhabited large territories of Central and Eastern Europe. After the 6th century Thracians that weren&#x27;t already assimilated in the Byzantine Empire, were incorporated in the slavic speaking Bulgarian Empire.

Bulgarian Thrace
Slavic tribes had mingled with the Thracian population, prior to the formation of the Bulgarian state. Under the leadership of Asparuh, in 680 AD the Thracians, Bulgars and Slavs readily united to establish the First Bulgarian Empire. These three ethnic groups mingled to produce the Bulgarian people. The Byzantine Empire, retained control over Thrace until the 7th century when the northern half of the entire region was claimed by the First Bulgarian Empire and the remainder was reorganized in the Thracian theme.

== Legacy ==
A recent Bulgarian study on the heritage of Thracian mounds in Bulgaria claims historical, cultural and ethnic links between Thracians and Bulgarians. Genetic studies on modern Bulgarians show that approximately 55% of Bulgarian autosomal genetic legacy is of Paleo-Balkan and Mediterranean origin which can be attributed to Thracians and other indigenous Balkan populations predating Slavs and Bulgars.

Greek Thrace

Turkish Thrace

==Culture==
=== Language ===

The records of Thracian writing are very scarce. There are only four inscriptions that have been discovered. One of them is a gold ring unearthed in the village of Ezerovo, Bulgaria. The thracian inscription is written using the Greek script and consists of 8 lines. Attempts to decipher the inscription have proven inconclusive.

===Religion===

One notable cult that existed in Thrace, Moesia, Phrygia and the lands of the Dacians and the Getae (Scythia Minor, now Dobrudja) was that of the &quot;Thracian horseman&quot;, also known as Sabazios or &quot;Thracian Heros&quot; known by a Thracian name as Heros &quot;Karabazmos&quot;, a god of the underworld, who was usually depicted on funeral statues as a horseman slaying a beast with a spear. Getae and Dacians potentially had a monotheistic religion based on the god Zalmoxis, though this is heavily debated in the anthropological community. The supreme Balkan thunder god Perkon was part of the Thracian pantheon, although cults of Orpheus and Zalmoxis likely overshadowed his.

The Thracians are considered the first to worship the god of wine called Dionysus in Greek or Zagreus in Thracian. Later this cult reached Ancient Greece. Some consider Thrace as the motherland of wine culture. The works of Homer, Herodotus and other historians of Ancient Greece also refer to the ancient Thracians&#x27; love for winemaking and consumption, also related to religion as early as 6000 years ago.

===Marriage===
The male Thracians were polygamous. Menander puts it: &quot;All Thracians, especially us and the Getae, are not much abstaining, because no one takes less than ten, eleven, twelve wives, some even more. If one dies and has only four or five wives he is called ill-fated, unhappy and unmarried.&quot; According to Herodotus virginity among women was not valued, and unmarried Thracian women could have sex with any man they wished to. 
There were men perceived as holy Thracians, who lived without women and were called &quot;ktisti&quot;. In myth, Orpheus rebuked the sexual advances of the Bistones women after the death of Eurydice, and was killed for not engaging in the activities promoted by the followers of Dionysus.

===Warfare===
The Thracians were a warrior people, known as both horsemen and lightly armed skirmishers with javelins. Thracian peltasts had a notable influence in Ancient Greece.

The history of Thracian warfare spans from c. 10th century BC up to the 1st century AD in the region defined by Ancient Greek and Latin historians as Thrace. It concerns the armed conflicts of the Thracian tribes and their kingdoms in the Balkans and in the Dacian territories. Emperor Traianus, also known as Trajan, conquered Dacia after two wars in the 2nd century AD. The wars ended with the occupation of the fortress of Sarmisegetusa and the death of the king Decebalus. Besides conflicts between Thracians and neighboring nations and tribes, numerous wars were recorded among Thracian tribes too.

==Genetics==
A genetic study published in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; in 2019 examined the mtDNA of 25 Thracian remains in Bulgaria from the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. They were found to harbor a mixture of ancestry from Western Steppe Herders (WSHs) and Early European Farmers (EEFs), supporting the idea that Southeast Europe was the link between Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.

A Bulgarian study from 2013 claims genetic similarity between Thracians (8-6 century BC), medieval Bulgarians (8–10 century AD), and modern Bulgarians, highlighting highest resemblance between them and Romanians, Northern Italians and Northern Greeks.

Examinations of Iron Age and ancient Thracian remains in Bulgaria were found to mainly carry the Y-DNA haplogroup E-V13. The tested samples were further specifically listed as: E-BY3880 x 3, E-L618 x 2, E-M78 x 2, R-Z93, E-CTS1273, E-BY14160.
Six of the samples were predicted for having brown eyes while two for having blue eyes, while majority of the samples were predicted for an intermediate skin color and hair color prediction ranged from majority brown on detailed, to light and dark.

==Thracology==
=== Archaeology ===

The branch of science that studies the ancient Thracians and Thrace is called Thracology. Archaeological research on the Thracian culture started in the 20th century, especially after World War II, mainly in southern Bulgaria. As a result of intensive excavations in the 1960s and 1970s a number of Thracian tombs and sanctuaries were discovered. Most significant among them are: the Getic burial complex and the Tomb of Sveshtari, the Valley of the Thracian Rulers and the Tomb of Kazanlak, Tatul, Seuthopolis, Perperikon, Tomb of Aleksandrovo in Bulgaria, Sarmizegetusa in Romania and others.
Also a large number of elaborately crafted gold and silver treasure sets from the 5th and 4th century BC were unearthed. In the following decades, those were exhibited in museums around the world, thus calling attention to ancient Thracian culture. Since the year 2000, Bulgarian archaeologist Georgi Kitov has made discoveries in Central Bulgaria, in an area now known as &quot;The Valley of the Thracian Kings&quot;. The residence of the Odrysian kings was found in Starosel in the Sredna Gora mountains. A 1922 Bulgarian study claimed that there were at least 6,269 necropolises in Bulgaria.

=== Multidisciplinary Studies ===

The dominant stance of history and archaeology as the two main disciplines dealing with the Thracians as a subject of research has been succeeded by a clear shift towards new multidisciplinary and more inclusive scientific perspectives. An example of this new trend was the large-scale multidisciplinary project &quot;Thracians – Genesis and Development of the Ethnos, Cultural Identities, Civilization Relations and Heritage of the Antiquity&quot;, launched in 2016 in Bulgaria. The project was the first comprehensive study of the Thracian heritage including 72 scholars from 18 institutes of the Bulgarian Academy of Science, as well as researchers from Canada, Italy, Germany, Japan and Switzerland. The project studied 13 scientific themes among which: formation of the Thracian ethnos, outlining of its ethno-cultural territory, continuity of the gene pool and related DNA studies, architectural, botanical, microbiological, astronomical, acoustic and linguistic aspects, mining and ceramics technologies, food and drink customs, that resulted in an extensively illustrated book including 33 scientific articles.

<text>Geneviève Alison Jane Moyet ( ; born 18 June 1961), formerly known as Alf, is an English singer. Noted for her powerful bluesy contralto voice, she came to prominence as half of the synth-pop duo Yazoo (known as Yaz in North America), but has since mainly worked as a solo artist.

By June 2023 her worldwide album sales have reached a certified 23 million, with over two million singles sold. All of Moyet&#x27;s ten studio albums and three compilation albums have charted in the top 30 of the UK Albums Chart, with two of them reaching number one, and she has had many top 10 hits on the UK Singles Chart.

==Early life and education ==
Geneviève Alison Jane Moyet was born on 18 June 1961 in Basildon, Essex, to a French father and English mother. She did not grow up bilingual, but spoke &quot;Franglais&quot;, and was called Alison from a young age.

She grew up in the nearby town of Basildon, where she attended Janet Duke Junior School and then Nicholas Comprehensive at secondary level, where she was in the same sixth form class as future Depeche Mode members Andrew Fletcher and Martin Gore. 

She was involved in a number of punk rock, pub rock, and blues bands in the southeast Essex area during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including the Vandals, the Screamin&#x27; Ab Dabs, the Vicars, and the Little Roosters. After leaving school at age 16, Moyet worked as a shop assistant and trained as a piano tuner.

==Music career==
At the age of 20, Moyet&#x27;s mainstream pop career began in 1982 with the formation of the synth-pop duo Yazoo with former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke. In the United States, the band operated under the name Yaz, due to trademark issues with the Yazoo Records record label already operating in the region. Yazoo had several hits, including &quot;Only You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, &quot;Situation&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Diary&quot;, and recorded two albums, &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;You and Me Both&quot;.

In 1983, Clarke decided to disband Yazoo. While Clarke went on to form The Assembly (another duo, this time with Eric Radcliffe) and then Erasure (a duo again, with Andy Bell), Moyet signed to CBS, and began her solo career. In 1984, Moyet released her debut solo album &quot;Alf&quot; (titled after her punk-era nickname). &quot;Alf&quot; was produced by the record producing and songwriting team of Jolley &amp; Swain. The album was co-written by the duo and Moyet, with the exception of &quot;Invisible&quot;, which was written for Moyet by Lamont Dozier. The record was a hit in Britain, reaching No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Alf&quot; spawned three international hit singles, &quot;Love Resurrection&quot; (UK No. 10), &quot;Invisible&quot; (UK No. 21) and &quot;All Cried Out&quot; (UK No. 8). In some European territories, a fourth single, &quot;For You Only&quot;, was also released. In the US, &quot;Invisible&quot; was a Top 40 hit; Moyet has stated in several interviews over the years that she can no longer relate to the song and will no longer perform it live. 

In 1985, Moyet performed at Live Aid alongside Paul Young and later returned unscheduled to the stage (alongside Bob Geldof, David Bowie and Pete Townshend) to provide vocals on &quot;Let It Be&quot; when Paul McCartney&#x27;s vocal microphone at his piano failed, leaving him unable to be heard for the first stanza of the song. (Twenty years later, he overdubbed his vocal for the Live Aid DVD release.) Moyet also released a single not featured on &quot;Alf&quot;, a cover of the standard &quot;That Ole Devil Called Love&quot;, which climbed to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart (it remains Moyet&#x27;s highest-charting UK single).

Moyet had another big UK hit the following year with &quot;Is This Love?&quot; (co-written by Eurythmics&#x27; Dave Stewart, under the pseudonym Jean Guiot), followed in 1987 by her second LP, &quot;Raindancing&quot;. &quot;Raindancing&quot; spawned further hit singles, including a cover of Floy Joy&#x27;s &quot;Weak in the Presence of Beauty&quot; and &quot;Ordinary Girl&quot;. In 1987, she scored another cover hit with &quot;Love Letters&quot;, which peaked at UK No. 4. The video for the song featured comedy duo French &amp; Saunders.

===1990s: Further recordings and hiatus===
Following a period of personal and career evaluation, she released &quot;Hoodoo&quot; in 1991. The album sold respectably in the UK, and Moyet was nominated for a Grammy for the single &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Long&quot;. However, the release of &quot;Hoodoo&quot; marked the beginning of an eight-year fight for Moyet to secure complete control of her artistic direction. Like many similar artists (including Aimee Mann and the late Kirsty MacColl), Moyet was reluctant to record a radio-friendly &quot;pop&quot; album simply for the sake of creating chart hits.

Moyet&#x27;s next album, &quot;Essex&quot; (1994), was also a source of controversy for her; in order for the album to be released, her label (now Sony) insisted that certain &quot;Essex&quot; tracks be re-recorded and re-produced, and that there be additional material remixed to create a more &quot;commercial&quot; package. The video for the single &quot;Whispering Your Name&quot; again featured Dawn French.

Following the release of &quot;Essex&quot;, Sony released a greatest hits compilation of Moyet&#x27;s work. &quot;Singles&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1 and, following a UK tour, was re-issued as a double CD set which included &quot;Live (No Overdubs)&quot;, a bonus live CD. Upon re-issue, &quot;Singles&quot; charted again, this time in the Top 20.

Due to prolonged litigation with Sony, Moyet did not record or release a new studio album for over eight years after the release of &quot;Essex&quot;. During this time, however, she recorded vocals for Tricky, Sylk-130, Ocean Colour Scene, The Lightning Seeds, and King Britt, and was featured on the British leg of the Lilith Fair tour. 2001 saw the release of &quot;The Essential Alison Moyet&quot; CD, and in 2002 &quot;The Essential Alison Moyet&quot; DVD.

In 1995, she sang back-up vocals with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor for one of Dusty Springfield&#x27;s last television appearances, singing &quot;Where Is a Woman to Go?&quot; on the music show &quot;Later...with Jools Holland&quot;.

===2000s: Return to recording and touring===
In August 2002, Moyet was released from her Sony contract. Moyet signed to Sanctuary Records and released her first studio album in eight years. &quot;Hometime&quot; was produced by The Insects, who had also produced works by Massive Attack and Madonna. The release of the CD launched Moyet into the top five best-selling female UK artists of 2002, and resulted in a BRIT Awards nomination for Best Female Vocalist, as well as a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize. &quot;Hometime&quot; was certified Gold in the UK for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.

&quot;Voice&quot;, a collection of cover versions, was released on 6 September 2004 and entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 7. Scored and produced by Academy Award winner Anne Dudley, the album was later re-issued with a bonus track, &quot;Alfie&quot;. A companion DVD, &quot;One Blue Voice&quot;, was released in 2006. &quot;Voice&quot; was certified Gold in the UK within four weeks of its release.

In December 2006, Moyet signed a recording contract with W14 Music, a Universal Music Group imprint. The deal saw Moyet reunited with label head John Williams, who was A&amp;R man for her previous two albums, &quot;Hometime&quot; and &quot;Voice&quot;.

Moyet&#x27;s album, &quot;The Turn&quot;, was released on 15 October 2007, preceded by the single &quot;One More Time&quot; a week earlier. The album featured self-penned songs, including the three numbers she wrote for the stage play, &quot;Smaller&quot; in which she starred with Dawn French. For these songs, again Moyet worked alongside producer/songwriter and frequent Moyet collaborator Pete Glenister. &quot;The Turn&quot; debuted at No. 21 on the UK Albums Chart on 22 October 2007. Moyet left W14 shortly after the release of &quot;The Turn&quot;. During mid-2008, Moyet reunited with Vince Clarke as Yazoo for a series of live dates.

Sony Music released &quot;The Best of Alison Moyet&quot; on 19 October 2009. It was Moyet&#x27;s personal selection of tracks from her seven solo albums. The deluxe edition of the album, &quot;The Best of: 25 Years Revisited&quot;, contained an extra disc, with re-recorded versions of older songs. Moyet supported the release with a tour of the UK and Ireland during November and December 2009. Also in 2009, she provided vocals to My Robot Friend&#x27;s single &quot;Waiting.&quot;

===2010–present: Return to synthpop roots===
Moyet appeared with Jools Holland throughout his tour of the UK in 2010. In the same year she contributed vocals to &quot;The Man That Got Away&quot; on Holland&#x27;s album &quot;Rocking Horse&quot;.

Moyet appeared with Heather Peace in January 2012 on the final concert of Peace&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Fairytales&quot;.

Moyet announced on BBC Radio 6 Music that her new album with Guy Sigsworth would be released in 2012, but in February that year she stated: &quot;I appear to have forfeited my recording deal because I won&#x27;t do reality TV. No-one needs to make an album that badly. Tea anyone?&quot; In an interview with &quot;Touchbase&quot; the following June, Moyet confirmed that she was still recording her album and that she was not rushing it. 

On 22 January 2013, Moyet announced that she had signed a worldwide deal with London-based record label Cooking Vinyl. Sony Music had earlier announced that Moyet&#x27;s four solo albums on the label (&quot;Alf&quot;, &quot;Raindancing&quot;, &quot;Hoodoo&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot;) were being digitally remastered and would be reissued with B-sides and bonus material. In February 2013, Moyet said of the remastered albums: &quot;The project was Sony&#x27;s – some initial work was done and then the project was suspended.&quot;
&quot;The Minutes&quot; was released in the UK on 6 May 2013. The first single, &quot;When I Was Your Girl&quot;, was released on 1 April 2013. A tour of the UK and Ireland to promote the album was announced for October. Describing the album, Moyet said: &quot;I avoided listening to anything during the process of writing and recording this album, choosing instead to be led by my own melodic voice, the one I now find myself with 30-years-in. Guy Sigsworth returns me to a programmer&#x27;s world and marries it with perfect musicality. I have been waiting for him. We have made an album mindless of industry mores that apply to middle-aged women and have shunned all talk of audiences, demographics and advert jazz covers. This has easily been my happiest studio experience&quot;. &quot;The Minutes&quot; debuted at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart, her highest debut since 1987&#x27;s &quot;Raindancing&quot;.

In July 2013, Moyet said that she has begun writing new material for the follow-up to &quot;The Minutes&quot;.

On 16 October 2013, Moyet appeared as a guest performer on ITV 1&#x27;s &quot;The One and Only Cilla Black&quot; celebrating Cilla Black&#x27;s 50 years in show business. Moyet sang &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot;.

On 10 November 2014, Moyet released a live album, &quot;Minutes and Seconds – Live&quot;, taken from &quot;The Minutes Tour&quot;.

On 30 July 2015, it was announced that Moyet would be releasing deluxe editions of her albums &quot;Hometime&quot;, &quot;Voice&quot;, and &quot;The Turn&quot;. According to her official web site: &quot;Each album will feature plenty of bonus material – including some rare and previously unreleased material.&quot;

On 21 September 2015, Moyet performed at the Burberry Show at London Fashion Week. Her set was released as a digital EP, &quot;Live for Burberry&quot; on 23 September.

On 27 September 2016, it was announced that Moyet&#x27;s first four studio albums &quot;Alf&quot;, &quot;Raindancing&quot;, &quot;Hoodooo&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot; would be reissued as Deluxe editions after having been remastered by BMG on 25 November 2016. Each double-disc set comes in a casebound book with the original album remastered from the original tapes along with 12-inch remixes, b-sides and previously unreleased songs.

Moyet&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Other&quot;, described as &quot;intelligent, adventurous electronic pop,&quot; co-produced by Guy Sigsworth, was released 16 June 2017 on Cooking Vinyl. From September through December that same year, she embarked on a world tour, The Other Tour.

In October 2017, Moyet featured as guest artist on the Norwegian band A-Ha&#x27;s acoustic album, &quot;MTV Unplugged – Summer Solstice&quot;, singing &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;. The performance was recorded at Giske island in Norway in June 2017.

On 20 April 2018, Moyet released her second live album, &quot;The Other Live Collection&quot;, taken from The Other Tour.

Moyet released the album &quot;Key&quot; on 4 October 2024. The albums contains 16 reworked singles and deep cuts, alongside two brand new tracks. A single, &quot;Such Small Ale&quot;, premiered on Vernon Kay&#x27;s mid-morning show on BBC Radio 2 and BBC Sounds on 13 June 2024. In June 2024, Moyet launched a podcast, &quot;40 Moyet Moments&quot;, a 40-part podcast series where she discusses key moments of her career. Moyet plans to embark on a world tour in 2025.

== Sales and charts ==
 her worldwide album sales have reached a certified 23 million, with over two million singles sold. All ten of her studio albums and three compilation albums have charted in the top 30 of the UK Albums Chart, reaching number one with the studio album &quot;Alf&quot; (1984) and the compilation album &quot;Singles&quot; (1995). She has also achieved nine top 30 singles and six top 10 hits on the UK Singles Chart.

==Theatre==
Moyet made her stage debut in the London West End production of the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; in 2001. She played the part of Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton. Although the play was initially intended for a short run, it was extended to six months.

In 2006, she appeared in the play &quot;Smaller&quot;, which undertook a regional tour before a stint at London&#x27;s Lyric Theatre.

==Personal life==
Moyet&#x27;s first marriage, to hairdresser and retired London firefighter Malcolm Lee, with whom she has a son, ended in divorce. Moyet has a daughter with former partner Kim McCarthy, and a daughter with her current husband David Ballard. In 2013, Moyet moved from Radlett, Hertfordshire, to Brighton.

She has been candid about her battles with weight and agoraphobia and the challenges of having dyslexia and ADHD. She embarked on a weight loss programme, because she did not want to become &quot;an obese old woman&quot;.

On 14 October 2014, Moyet was presented with a Gold Badge Award by professional music writers association The Ivors Academy.

Moyet was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to music.

She is a supporter of Southend United.

Moyet received a degree in Fine Art Printmaking from the University of Brighton in 2023 at age 62.

<text>TV Guide is an American digital media company that provides television program listings information as well as entertainment and television-related news.

In 2008, the company sold its founding product, the &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine and the entire print magazine division, to a private buyout firm operated by Andrew Nikou, who then set up the print operation as TV Guide Magazine LLC. 

==Corporate history==
===Prototype===
The prototype of what would become &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine was developed by Lee Wagner (1910–1993), who was the circulation director of MacFadden Publications in New York City in the 1930s – and later, by the time of the predecessor publication&#x27;s creation, for Cowles Media Company – distributing magazines focusing on movie celebrities.

In 1948, Wagner printed New York City area listings magazine &quot;The TeleVision Guide&quot;, which was first released on local newsstands on June 14 of that year. Silent film star Gloria Swanson, who then starred in the short-lived variety series &quot;The Gloria Swanson Hour&quot;, appeared on the cover of the first issue. Wagner later began publishing regional editions of &quot;The TeleVision Guide&quot; for New England and the Baltimore–Washington area. Five years later, he sold the editions to Walter Annenberg, who folded it into his publishing and broadcasting company Triangle Publications, but remained as a consultant for the magazine until 1963.

===Annenberg/Triangle era===
The national &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s first issue was released on April 3, 1953, accumulating a total circulation of 1,560,000 copies that were sold in the ten U.S. cities where it was distributed. The inaugural cover featured a photograph of Lucille Ball&#x27;s newborn son Desi Arnaz Jr., with a downscaled inset photo of Ball placed in the top corner under the issue&#x27;s headline: &quot;Lucy&#x27;s $50,000,000 baby&quot;. The magazine was published in digest size, which remained its printed format for 52 years. From its first issue until the July 2–8, 1954, issue, listings within each edition of &quot;TV Guide&quot; began on Friday and ended on Thursday; the July 9–16, 1954, issue began on a Friday and ended on the following Friday. Then, beginning with the July 17–23, 1954, issue, the listings in each week&#x27;s issue changed to start on Saturday and end on Friday, which remained the listings format for all local editions until April 2004. The formation of &quot;TV Guide&quot; as a national publication resulted from Triangle Publications&#x27; purchase of numerous regional television listing publications such as &quot;TV Forecast&quot; (which was circulated in the Chicago area and, upon its first publication on May 9, 1948, was the first continuously published television listings magazine), &quot;TV Digest&quot; (which was distributed in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and was originally distributed under the title, the &quot;Local Televiser&quot;, when it was first released on November 7, 1948), and the New York-based &quot;Television Guide&quot; (which had its title abbreviated to &quot;TV Guide&quot; on March 18, 1950). Each of the cities that had their own local TV listings magazine folded into &quot;TV Guide&quot; were among the initial cities where the magazine conducted its national launch.

The launch as a national magazine with local listings in April 1953 became an almost instant success. However, the circulation decreased over subsequent weeks, even as the magazine&#x27;s distribution expanded to five additional cities (Pittsburgh, Rochester, Detroit, Cleveland and San Francisco) throughout the summer of 1953. By mid-August of that year, sales of the magazine had dropped 200,000 copies below that of the first issue. &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s fortunes began to turn around with the September 4–10, 1953, issue – the magazine&#x27;s first &quot;Fall Preview&quot; issue – when circulation hit 1,746,327 copies; circulation levels increased steadily over time, to the point where &quot;TV Guide&quot; eventually became the most read and circulated magazine in the United States by the 1960s. The initial cost of each issue was 15¢ per copy (equivalent to $ in . The price per issue has gradually risen over the years, selling for $4.99 per copy as of 2025). In addition to subscriptions, &quot;TV Guide&quot; was sold at the checkout counters of grocery stores nationwide. Until the 1980s, the feature pieces included in each issue were promoted in a television commercial. Under Triangle, &quot;TV Guide&quot; continued to grow not only in circulation, but also in recognition as the authority on television programming with articles – the majority of which typically appear in the color section – from both staff and contributing writers.
Over the decades, the shape of the &quot;TV Guide&quot; logo has changed to reflect the modernization of the television screen, eventually adopting a widescreen appearance in September 2003, and then to its current flatscreen appearance in September 2016 (different versions of the logo – the only cosmetic difference being the utilization of different typefaces – are currently used respectively for the magazine and the separately owned, CBS-managed digital properties). At first, the logo had various colored backgrounds (usually black, white, blue or green) until the familiar red background became the standard in the 1960s with occasional customizations being utilized for special editions.

The magazine was first based in a small office in downtown Philadelphia, before moving to more spacious national headquarters in Radnor, Pennsylvania, in the late 1950s. The new facility had a large lighted &quot;TV Guide&quot; logo at the building&#x27;s entrance. It housed management, editors, production personnel and subscription processors as well as a vast computer system holding data on every television show and movie available for listing in the popular weekly publication. Printing of the national color section of &quot;TV Guide&quot; – which incorporates television-related stories, and select feature columns such as program reviews – took place at Triangle&#x27;s Gravure Division plant – which was known for performing some of the highest quality printing in the industry, with almost always perfect registration – located adjacent to the company&#x27;s landmark Inquirer Building on North Broad Street in Philadelphia. The color section was then sent to regional printers to be wrapped around the local listing sections.

In addition to &quot;TV Guide&quot; and its flagship newspaper &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, Triangle Publications also owned the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;; ten radio and six television stations (WFIL AM-FM-TV in Philadelphia, WNHC AM-FM-TV in New Haven, Connecticut, KFRE AM-FM-TV in Fresno, California, WNBF AM-FM-TV in Binghamton, New York, WFBG AM-FM-TV in Altoona, Pennsylvania and WLYH-TV in Lancaster–Lebanon, Pennsylvania), as well as &quot;The Daily Racing Form&quot;; &quot;The Morning Telegraph&quot;; &quot;Seventeen&quot;; and various cable television interests. (It was under Triangle&#x27;s ownership of WFIL-TV that &quot;American Bandstand&quot; came to popularity, which, in turn, led to host Dick Clark ascending to become a major television personality.) Triangle Publications sold its Philadelphia newspapers to Knight Newspapers in 1969, its radio and television stations during the early 1970s to Capital Cities Communications (the television stations that are now known as KFSN-TV and WPVI-TV were subsequently acquired by ABC through its 1986 merger with Capital Cities) and various other interests, retaining only &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;The Daily Racing Form&quot;.

For the magazine&#x27;s first 52 years of publication, listings information was displayed in a &quot;log&quot; format, a mainly text-based list of programs organized by both start time and channel, which was the sole method – eventually, primary once prime time grids were incorporated, and later secondary for the final two years of its inclusion of local listings – of displaying program information in &quot;TV Guide&quot; until the switch to national listings in 2005. This allowed for the display of full titles for each program as well as the inclusion of synopses for movies and most programs. Most listing entries in the log included program genres (and for national news programs, anchors) after the program&#x27;s title, while its running time (which was mentioned only if a program lasted a minimum of one hour – later 35 minutes – in length) was listed (in hours and minutes) in the synopses.

Channel numbers were set in a tiny round icon (known as a &quot;bullet&quot;) at the beginning of the listing. This bullet was soon modified to be the shape of a TV screen, similar to the shape of the &quot;TV Guide&quot; logo. In most editions, stations serving a particular edition&#x27;s immediate local coverage area were denoted with a white numeral for its channel number set inside a black TV-shaped bullet. Stations serving neighboring communities outside the immediate area, but which could also be viewed in the primary local area, were denoted with a black numeral inside a white TV-shaped bullet outlined in black (for example, in the San Francisco edition, stations based in San Francisco or Oakland had their channel numbers listed as white-on-black TV-shaped bullets, while stations serving neighboring Sacramento or Salinas/Monterey (but could still be viewed in parts of San Francisco or Oakland, including their suburbs, as fringe reception) had their channel numbers listed as black-on-white icons). A particular listing could begin with as many as three or more channel bullets depending upon the number of stations in the immediate and surrounding areas broadcasting the same program at that particular time (usually different affiliates of the same network, based in the primary city as well as in neighboring areas). See the subsection &quot;Listings section&quot;, in the &quot;Editions&quot; section below, for a detailed explanation.

Originally, the majority of programs listed in the log each issue featured brief synopses, except for local and national newscasts, and programs airing on certain stations in various timeslots. As other broadcast television stations and cable channels were added, due to set space requirements for the local listings section, detailed synopses were gradually restricted to series and specials – usually those airing in evening &quot;prime time&quot; timeslots – as well as movies airing on broadcast television, while shorter synopses were used for programs seen on broadcast stations outside of the edition&#x27;s home market and select cable channels; and only the title along with basic supplementary information (such as genre and/or program length) for most other broadcast and cable programs. In addition, black-and-white ads for programs scheduled to air on broadcast stations – and later, cable channels – during prime time (with local airtimes, and for broadcast stations, information for network-affiliated stations featured in the edition which were scheduled to air the advertised show) were included within the listings. Ads for major network programs were generally produced by the networks themselves (and often, the networks would run a full-page or even a double-truck ad for an entire night of programming, or for a major movie or special, or for the season premiere of a Saturday morning cartoon lineup); ads for locally produced programs, including local newscasts, were produced by individual stations (network affiliates as well as independent stations). Such locally provided ads almost always used the distinctive logos used by particular stations (for example, the &quot;Circle 7&quot; logo used for many years primarily by stations either owned by, or affiliated with, ABC). (Black-and-white ads for general products, services and special offers, similar to those seen in other national magazines, were also placed in the listings section.)

A regular feature of the listings section was &quot;Close-Up&quot;, usually a half-page segment, which provided expanded reviews of select programs airing each day (various editions of &quot;Close-Up&quot; were eventually used for different types of programs, from premieres of new series to shows airing on cable). Over time, other regular and recurring features (most of them television-related) were included alongside the listings including &quot;Insider&quot; (a television news and interview section in the lead pages of the color section); &quot;Cheers and Jeers&quot; (a critique page about various aspects of television programming); &quot;Hits and Misses&quot; (featuring brief reviews of select programs in the coming week, rated on a score from 0 to 10); &quot;Guidelines&quot; (a half-page daily section featuring highlights of five or six programs of interest); horoscopes; recaps of the previous week&#x27;s storylines on network daytime soap operas; a page reviewing new home video (and later, DVD) releases; dedicated pages that respectively listed select sporting events, children&#x27;s programs and &quot;four-star&quot; movies being broadcast during that week; and crossword puzzles. Although its issues usually focus on different television-related stories week to week, &quot;TV Guide&quot; also incorporates recurring issues that appear a few times each year, most notably the &quot;Fall Preview&quot; (an issue featured since the magazine&#x27;s inaugural year in 1953, which features reviews of new series premiering during the fall television season), &quot;Returning Favorites&quot; (first published in 1996, featuring previews of series renewed from the previous television season returning for the upcoming fall schedule), &quot;Winter Preview&quot; (first published in 1994 and later known as the &quot;(year) TV Preview&quot; from 2006 to 2009, featuring previews of midseason series) and &quot;The Best Children&#x27;s Shows on TV&quot; (first published in 1989 and later renamed the &quot;Parents&#x27; Guide to Children&#x27;s Television&quot; in 1990, and finally as the &quot;Parent&#x27;s Guide to Kids&#x27; TV&quot; in 1993, featuring stories and reviews on family-oriented programs).

Icons used for other means than identifying listed stations were first added to the magazine around 1956, using the words &quot;SPECIAL&quot; and &quot;COLOR&quot;, each set in capital letters inside a rectangular bar, to denote television specials and programs broadcast in color, respectively. &quot;TV Guide&quot; modified all icons incorporated into the local listings section in May 1969, changing the font for the TV-shaped bullets identifying local stations from Futura to the standard Helvetica and using similarly TV-shaped bullets marked with the abbreviation &quot;C&quot; to denote color programs (replacing the bar/text icons that had been previously used). As color programming became more ubiquitous, in August 1972, the magazine opted to identify programs originating in black and white (marked under the abbreviation &quot;BW&quot;) within the listings section. In September 1981, listings began to identify programs presented with closed or open captions or with on-screen sign language interpretation.

Being an era when program episodes tended to be faithfully recurring from week to week, TV Guide listings would make note of alterations from the routine or a change in status: &quot;[Gunsmoke is pre-empted]&quot;; &quot;(last episode of the series)&quot;, &quot;Debut: &quot;, &quot;Special&quot;. Until the 1970s, double-feature or triple-feature movie presentations by a station would be listed at the starting time of the first feature: &quot;MOVIE--Double Feature&quot;, then list the movies with numeric bullets in front of each title and synopsis; subsequent to 1970, the magazine listed each movie in its own time entry.

A day&#x27;s listings continued well past midnight until the last station signed off following prime time programs of the calendar day before, possibly as late as 4:00 a.m. The next day&#x27;s listings could begin as early as 5:00 a.m., or earlier.

====Addition of cable listings====

The advent of cable television would pose challenges to &quot;TV Guide&quot;. Cable channels began to be listed in the magazine in 1980 or 1981, depending on the edition; the channels listed also differed with the corresponding edition. Regional and national superstations available on cable systems in the designated market of many editions were the only cable channels listed initially as well as, in certain markets, over-the-air subscription services transmitted over local independent stations (such as ONTV); local subscription television services were often listed as &quot;STV Programming&quot; or &quot;Subscription Television&quot; for the channel carrying the service, with the service listed separately or, in some editions, not at all. Cable-originated channels – such as HBO, CNN (both of which the magazine originally promoted mainly in full-page advertisements), the CBN Cable Network (now Freeform), the Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS, later succeeded by A&amp;E through its 1984 merger with The Entertainment Channel) and Nickelodeon – were added gradually between the winter of late 1981 and the first half of 1982, depending on the edition.

To save page space, &quot;TV Guide&quot; incorporated a grid (a rowed display of listings for programs scheduled to air during the evening hours each night, primarily organized by channel) into the listings between 1979 and 1981, which was slotted at a random page within each day&#x27;s afternoon listings. The grid originated as a single-page feature that provided a summary of programs airing during prime time (from 7:00 to 10:00 p.m. or 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. depending on the start of prime time within a given time zone) on the stations mentioned in the corresponding edition; by 1983, it was expanded to a two-page section – which began to take up roughly three-quarters of the two adjoining pages on which it was placed – that included programs airing during the early access and late fringe periods (from 5:00 to 11:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. local time), with the beginning and end of the magazine-defined prime time daypart (between 7:30 and 11:00 p.m. or between 6:30 and 10:00 p.m. local time on Monday through Saturdays, and between 7:00 and 11:00 p.m. or between 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. local time on Sundays) delineated by a thicker border. Channels listed in the grid were organized by broadcast stations, basic cable channels, and premium channels.

In 1983, depending on the edition, a new feature was added, the &quot;Pay-TV Movie Guide&quot; (renamed the &quot;Premium Channels Movie Guide&quot; in 1997), initially preceded the listings before being moved to the pages immediately following the Friday listings in January 1989, resulting in the national section – which had been cordoned into two sections, both preceding and following the local section – being consolidated into the first half of the pages comprising each issue. Preceding this addition, some editions carried The &quot;Movie Guide&quot;, which also preceded the listings, provided summaries of films scheduled to air over the next one to two weeks on the cable channels included in both the log &quot;and&quot; grid listings (excluding those featured exclusively in the grids) as well as a first-page summary of the films scheduled to premiere that week (arranged by channel and sub-categorized by title). As the years went on, more cable channels were added into the listings of each edition. To help offset this, the May 11–17, 1985, issue introduced a smaller Helvetica font for the log, along with some other cosmetic changes; in particular, a show&#x27;s length began to be listed after the show&#x27;s title instead of at the end of its synopsis. That issue also saw advertising for local stations featured in the corresponding edition be restricted to certain special events, with most program promotions being restricted to those for national broadcast and cable networks.

===News Corporation and Gemstar eras===

On August 7, 1988, Triangle Publications was sold to the News America Corporation arm of News Corporation for $3 billion, one of the largest media acquisitions of the time and the most expensive publication transaction at the time. The November 3–9, 1990, issue saw the addition of VCR Plus+ codes in some of the magazine&#x27;s regional editions, for users with devices incorporating the technology – which was developed by eventual &quot;TV Guide&quot; parent Gemstar International Group Ltd. – to input into their VCRs to automatically record television programs. (Two-digit PlusCodes corresponding to the channel airing the program that a user wished to record were listed after each channel in the channel directory page; one- to eight-digit codes for individual programs were listed in the log listings section following the title of each program.) The PlusCodes expanded to all local editions beginning with the September 14–20, 1991, issue. The September 12–18, 1992, issue saw the addition of bullet icons identifying colorized versions (marked under the abbreviation &quot;CZ&quot;) of older feature films or television shows.

On March 7, 1996, &quot;TV Guide&quot; launched the iGuide, originally developed by the News Corporation-MCI joint venture Delphi Internet Service Corp. as a web portal, which featured more comprehensive television listings data than those offered by the magazine (with information running two weeks in advance of the present date), as well as news content, &quot;TV Guide&quot; editorial content and a search feature called CineBooks, which allowed users to access detailed information on about 30,000 film titles. Later that year, content from the print publication was added to iGuide as well as content from News Corporation&#x27;s other media properties. On January 13, 1997, shortly before MCI bowed out of the venture, iGuide was relaunched as the TV Guide Entertainment Network (TVGEN), which was renamed TV Guide Online in 2002. The refocused site covered television, music, movies and sports (with content concerning the latter sourced from Fox Sports), along with wire news and features from Reuters, &quot;Daily Variety&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot;, free e-mail updates for registered users, and a chat room that was developed to accommodate 5,000 users simultaneously.

Additional changes to the listings took place with the September 14–20, 1996 edition of the print publication. Starting with that issue, program titles switched from being displayed in all-uppercase to being shown in a mixed case, Franklin Gothic typeface, film titles – which had previously been displayed within the film description – began appearing before a film&#x27;s synopsis in an italicized format (replacing the generic &quot;MOVIE&quot; header that had been used to identify films since the magazine&#x27;s inception), and children&#x27;s programs that were compliant with the Children&#x27;s Television Act of 1990 began to be designated by a circular &quot;E/I&quot; icon. In addition, infomercials (which had been designated under the boilerplate title &quot;COMMERCIAL PROGRAM[S]&quot; until 1994, and &quot;INFORMERCIAL[S]&quot; thereafter) ceased being listed in the magazine during time periods in which stations aired them. (Time-brokered programs continued to be listed in the magazine, but were primarily restricted to religious programming.) Replacing the text identifiers that had been included within the film synopses, theatrically released films also began to be identified by a black-and-white boxed &quot;M&quot; symbol, accompanied depending on the film by its star rating (a formula, on a scale of one [for &quot;poor&quot;] to four [for &quot;excellent&quot;], based on a consensus of reviews from leading film critics, the quality of the film&#x27;s cast and director, and the film&#x27;s box office revenue and award wins). Movie icons also were appropriated to identify direct-to-video (marked as &quot;M→V&quot;) or made-for-TV (marked as &quot;M→T&quot;) releases, which were not assigned star ratings. Beginning with the January 25–31, 1997, issue, the log listings began incorporating content ratings for programs assigned through the newly implemented TV Parental Guidelines system (the system&#x27;s content ratings were subsequently added upon their introduction in October 1998).

News Corporation sold &quot;TV Guide&quot; to the United Video Satellite Group, parent company of Prevue Networks, on June 11, 1998, for $800 million and 60 million shares of stock worth an additional $1.2 billion (this followed an earlier merger attempt between the two companies in 1996 that eventually fell apart). Following the sale, reports suggested that &quot;TV Guide&quot; would remove program listings from the magazine, shifting them entirely to its new sister cable network Prevue Channel, which would be rebranded as a result of United Video&#x27;s purchase of &quot;TV Guide Magazine&quot;; News Corporation executives later stated that listings information would remain part of the magazine. That year, United Video acquired TVSM Inc. (publishers of competing listings guides &quot;Total TV&quot; and &quot;The Cable Guide&quot;) in a $75 million all-cash acquisition; as a result, &quot;TV Guide&quot; merged with &quot;Total TV&quot;, and began printing a version of the magazine in the latter magazine&#x27;s full-size format (while retaining the original digest size version) effective with the July 11, 1998, issue.

Because most cable systems published their own listing magazine reflecting their channel lineup, and now had a separate guide channel or an electronic program guide that can be activated by remote and provide the same information in a more detailed manner – with additional competition coming in the late 1990s from websites that also specialize in providing detailed television program information (such as TVGuide.com, then jointly operated with &quot;TV Guide Magazine&quot;, and Zap2It), a printed listing of programming in a separate magazine became less valuable. The sheer amount and diversity of cable television programming made it hard for &quot;TV Guide&quot; to provide listings of the extensive array of programming that came directly over the cable system. &quot;TV Guide&quot; also could not match the ability of the cable box to store personalized listings. Nevertheless, beginning with the September 12–18, 1998, issue, the magazine added several new channels to many of its editions, including those that had previously been mentioned only in a foreword on the channel lineup page as well as those that were available mainly on digital cable and satellite; although most of these newly added channels were placed within the prime time grids, only a few (such as Animal Planet and MSNBC) were also incorporated into the log listings.

Features in the magazine were also revamped with the additions of &quot;The Robins Report&quot; (a review column by writer J. Max Robins), &quot;Family Page&quot; (featuring reviews of family-oriented programs) and picks of select classic films airing that week, as well as the removal of the &quot;Guidelines&quot; feature in the listings section in favor of the new highlight page &quot;Don&#x27;t Miss&quot; (listing choice programs selected by the magazine&#x27;s staff for the coming week) in the national color section. Listings for movies within the log also began identifying made-for-TV and direct-to-video films, as well as quality ratings on a scale of one to four stars (signifying movies that have received &quot;poor&quot; to &quot;excellent&quot; reviews).

In 1999, the magazine began hosting the &quot;TV Guide Awards&quot;, an awards show (which was telecast on Fox) honoring television programs and actors, with the winners being chosen by &quot;TV Guide&quot; subscribers through a nominee ballot inserted in the magazine. The telecast was discontinued after the 2001 event. The July 17–23, 1999, edition saw the evening grids scaled down to the designated prime time hours, 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. (or 7:00 to 10:00 p.m.) Monday through Saturdays and 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. (or 6:00 to 10:00 p.m.) on Sundays, to complement the descriptive log listings for those time periods; this also allowed the grids to be contained to a single page in certain editions that provided listings for more than 20 cable channels.

On October 5, 1999, Gemstar International Group Ltd., the maker of the VCR Plus+ device and schedule system (whose channel and program codes for VCRs using the system for timed recordings were incorporated into the magazine&#x27;s listings in 1988), and which incidentally was partially owned by News Corporation, purchased United Video Satellite Group. The two companies were previously involved in a legal battle over the intellectual property rights for their respective interactive program guide systems, VCR Plus+ and TV Guide On Screen, that began in 1994. That month, &quot;TV Guide&quot; debuted a 16-page insert into editions in 22 markets with large Hispanic populations titled &quot;TV Guide en Español&quot;, which provided programming information from national Spanish language networks (such as Univision and Telemundo) as well as special sections with reviews of the week&#x27;s notable programs. The magazine discontinued the insert in March 2000 due to difficulties resulting from confusion by advertisers over its marketing as &quot;the first weekly Spanish-language magazine&quot;, despite its structure as an insert within the main &quot;TV Guide&quot; publication.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of &quot;TV Guide&quot; as a national magazine, in 2002, the magazine published six special issues:
* &quot;TV We&#x27;ll Always Remember&quot; (April 6–12): Our Favorite Stars Share Fifty Years of Memories, Moments and Magic&quot;
* &quot;50 Greatest Shows of All Time&quot; (May 4–10): The Ultimate List of the 50 Best TV Series. (Just Try to Guess What&#x27;s No. 1!)&quot;
** Note: This was the only one to be presented on television itself (in the form of a two-hour special) and referenced in the book &quot;TV Guide: Fifty Years of Television&quot;, considering the magazine&#x27;s purpose to present weekly listings of regularly scheduled series.
* &quot;Our 50 Greatest Covers of All Time (June 15–21): Fabulous Photos of Your Favorite Shows and Stars Plus: Amazing Behind-the-Scenes Stories&quot;
* &quot;50 Worst Shows of All Time (July 20–26): Not Just Bad! Really Awful – And We Love Them That Way!&quot;
* &quot;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time (August 3–9): Funny! Clever! Drawn to perfection! They&#x27;re the tops in toons!&quot;
* &quot;50 Sexiest Stars of All Time (September 28–October 4): Charisma, Curves, Confidence, Charm! Could We Be Having Any More Fun?&quot;

By 2003, the number of cable channels that were only listed in the grids expanded, with the addition of channels such as BBC America, Soapnet and the National Geographic Channel (some editions also featured a limited number of broadcast stations – either in-market, out-of-market or both – exclusively in the grids). Conversely, sister cable network TV Guide Channel (whose listings were added to the magazine after the Gemstar purchase) was relegated from the log listings to the grids in most editions. From its inception until 2003, &quot;TV Guide&quot; had offered listings for the entire week, 24 hours a day. Numerous changes to the local listings took place beginning with the June 21, 2003 issue – in just a few select markets, when the 5:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday listings were condensed down to four grids: these ran from 5:00 to 8:00 a.m., 8:00 to 11:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., and 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. If programming differed from one weekday to the next, the generic descriptor &quot;Various Programs&quot; was listed. The weekday grid maintained day-to-day listings for certain cable channels (primarily movie channels as well as a limited number of basic cable channels such as Lifetime, The History Channel and USA Network), which were organized separately from the other channels. These changes became permanent in all &quot;TV Guide&quot; editions beginning with the September 13, 2003, &quot;Fall Preview&quot; issue.

Other changes were made to the magazine beginning with the June 21 issue in select markets and the 2003 &quot;Fall Preview&quot; issue elsewhere. A half-page daily prime time highlights section featuring the evening&#x27;s notable shows, movies and sports events – similar to the former &quot;Guidelines&quot; feature – was re-added to the listings section; a full-page &quot;Weekday Highlights&quot; page was also added featuring guest and topical information for the week&#x27;s daytime talk and morning shows as well as picks for movies airing during the day on broadcast and cable channels. In addition, while log listings continued in use for prime time listings, program synopses were added to the grids and log, as well as a &quot;NEW&quot; indicator for first-run episodes, replacing the &quot;(Repeat)&quot; indicator in the log&#x27;s synopses. The &quot;Premium Channels Movie Guide&quot; was also restructured as &quot;The Big Movie Guide&quot;, with film listings being expanded to include those airing on all broadcast networks and cable channels featured in each edition (as well as some that were not listed in a particular local edition), as well as movies that were available on pay-per-view (page references to the films included in this section were also incorporated into the prime time grids and log listings). Beginning in January 2004, the midnight to 5:00 a.m. listings (as well as the Saturday and Sunday 5:00 to 8:00 a.m. listings) ceased to include any broadcast stations outside of the edition&#x27;s home market, leaving only program information for stations within the home market and for cable channels.

The magazine&#x27;s format was changed beginning with the April 11, 2004, issue to start the week&#x27;s listings in each issue on Sunday (the day in which television listings magazines supplemented in newspapers traditionally began each week&#x27;s listings information), rather than Saturday. In July 2004, the overnight listings were removed entirely, replaced by a grid that ran from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. that included only the broadcast stations in each edition&#x27;s home market and a handful of cable channels. It also listed a small selection of late-night movies airing on certain channels. The time period of the listings in the daytime grids also shifted from starting at 5:00 a.m. and ending at 5:00 p.m. to running from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. By this point, the log listings were restricted to programs airing from 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. In early 2005, more channels were added to the prime time and late-night grids.

====Format overhaul and conversion to national listings====

On July 26, 2005, Gemstar-TV Guide announced that &quot;TV Guide&quot; would abandon its longtime digest size format and begin printing as a larger full-size national magazine that would offer more stories and fewer program listings. All 140 local editions were eliminated, being replaced by two editions covering the time zones within the contiguous United States: one for the Eastern and Central time zones, and one for the Pacific and Mountain time zones (which had existed separately from the local editions prior to the change, although their distribution was primarily limited to hotels). The change in format was attributed to the increase in the internet, cable television channels (like TV Guide Network), electronic program guides and digital video recorders as the sources of choice for viewers&#x27; program listings. The new version of &quot;TV Guide&quot; went on sale on October 17, 2005, and featured &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; host Ty Pennington on the cover. The listings format, now consisting entirely of grids, also changed to start the listings in each week&#x27;s issue on Monday rather than Sunday. As a result of the elimination of the local editions, broadcast stations were replaced by broadcast network schedules with the description &quot;Local Programming&quot; being used to denote time periods in which syndicated, locally produced or paid programs would air instead of network shows.

In September 2006, &quot;TV Guide&quot; launched a redesigned website, with expanded original editorial and user-generated content not included in the print magazine. On December 22, 2006, &quot;TV Guide&quot; introduced the magazine&#x27;s first ever two-week edition. The edition, which featured Rachael Ray on the cover, was issued for the period from December 25, 2006 to January 7, 2007. In early 2008, the Monday through Friday daytime and daily late night grids were eliminated from the listings section, and the television highlights section was compressed into a six-page review of the week, rather than the previous two pages for each night. By 2007, &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s circulation had decreased to less than three million copies from a peak of almost 20 million in 1970.

With the $2.8 billion acquisition of Gemstar-TV Guide by Macrovision on May 2, 2008, that company, which purchased the former mostly to take advantage of their lucrative and profitable VCR Plus and electronic program guide patents, stated it wanted to sell both the magazine and TV Guide Network, along with the company&#x27;s horse racing channel TVG Network to other parties.

====&quot;TV Guide Talk&quot;====
On May 18, 2005, &quot;TV Guide Talk&quot;, a weekly podcast that was available to download for free, was launched. The podcast was headlined by &quot;TV Guide&quot; reporter/personality Michael Ausiello, and was co-hosted by his colleagues at the magazine, Matt Webb Mitovich, Angel Cohn, Daniel Manu and Maitland McDonagh. Each episode featured commentary from TV Guide staff on the week&#x27;s entertainment news stories, television programs, and film releases, as well as occasional interviews with actors, producers, and executives. On April 4, 2008 (following Ausiello&#x27;s move to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;), it was announced that the podcast would be ending, and the final episode (Episode No. 139) was released on April 10, 2008.

&quot;TV Guide Talk&quot; podcasts were released every Friday afternoon and averaged an hour in length. They featured the participants discussing and commenting on the past week in television and the entertainment industry in general. The beginning of each podcast was devoted to in-depth discussion on the week&#x27;s biggest new story in the entertainment industry, whether it be a television program or something outside the scope of television show or movie (such as the Academy Awards or the Emmys). The middle part was devoted to discussion and commentary on individual shows. The podcast emphasized programs that tend to have a large online following even if that following is not necessarily reflected in the programs&#x27; Nielsen rating. Examples include &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, and &quot;Project Runway&quot; (the latter three being examples a low-rated shows which nevertheless have sizable online followings). Each podcast also ended with a weekly review of that weekend&#x27;s new theatrical releases.

===OpenGate Capital era===
On October 13, 2008, Macrovision sold the money-losing magazine (which was reportedly posting revenue losses of $20 million per year by that point) to Beverly Hills-based equity fund OpenGate Capital for $1, and a $9.5 million loan at 3% interest. As part of the sale, however, Macrovision retained ownership of the companion website – which was then sold to equity firm One Equity Partners for $300 million – which severed all editorial connections between the magazine and website, including the end of critic Matt Roush&#x27;s presence on TVGuide.com. The editorial content of the magazine was launched on a new site, TVGuideMagazine.com, which did not feature &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s listings in any form. TVGuideMagazine.com was later shut down on June 1, 2010; &quot;TV Guide Magazine&quot; and TVGuide.com then entered into a deal to restore content from the magazine to the latter website, which Lionsgate Entertainment had bought along with the TV Guide Network in January 2009.

===CBS Interactive/CNET era===
In March 2013, CBS Corporation acquired One Equity Partners&#x27; stake of their TV Guide assets. The CBS acquisition was finalized later that month for $100 million. On May 31, 2013, CBS bought Lionsgate&#x27;s share of TV Guide Digital, which includes the website and mobile apps. On January 31, 2014, OpenGate Capital and CBS Interactive announced a deal to cross-promote &quot;TV Guide Magazine&quot; with TVGuide.com and CBS Interactive&#x27;s other internet properties (including TV.com, Metacritic and CNET).

===Sales to Red Ventures and Fandom Inc.===
In 2020, Red Ventures acquired the assets of CNET Media Group, including TV Guide, from ViacomCBS.

On October 3, 2022, Red Ventures sold TV Guide and other entertainment websites to Fandom Inc.

====TV Guide Channel/Network====

In June 1998, the &quot;TV Guide&quot; brand and magazine were acquired by United Video Satellite Group, the parent company of the Prevue Channel – a channel first launched in 1981 as the Electronic Program Guide network, that was carried by cable and some satellite television providers and was originally formatted to feature a scrolling program guide, short segments featuring previews of upcoming programs, and promos and short-form film trailers for programs airing on various channels. Its new owners promptly rebranded Prevue as the TV Guide Channel on February 1, 1999. With the rebranding, some of the hourly segments featured on the channel at that point were renamed after features in the magazine, including &quot;TV Guide Close-Up&quot;, &quot;TV Guide Sportsview&quot; (which was formatted more similarly to the listings section&#x27;s sports guide than the color column of that name) and &quot;TV Guide Insider&quot;. After Gemstar&#x27;s acquisition of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, the channel began to shift toward airing full-length programs featuring celebrity gossip and movie-focused talk shows alongside the program listings. The channel was rebranded as the TV Guide Network in 2007.

Following the respective sales of TV Guide&#x27;s magazine and cable channel by Macrovision to OpenGate Capital and Lionsgate, the magazine and TV Guide Network became operationally separate, although the two properties still collaborated on content for TVGuide.com. After CBS Corporation bought stakes in TV Guide&#x27;s properties in March 2013, TV Guide Network was rebranded under the abbreviated name TVGN that April to de-emphasize its ties to &quot;TV Guide Magazine&quot;, as part of a transition into a general entertainment format while the channel gradually decommissioned its scrolling listings grid. The network was relaunched as Pop on January 14, 2015, with its programming focus shifting towards shows about pop culture and its fandom.
===Interactive program guides===
====TV Guide Interactive====
TV Guide Interactive is the former name of an interactive electronic program guide software system incorporated into digital set-top boxes provided by cable providers. The program listings grid rendered by the software was similar to the late-2000s look of the listings of TV Guide Network/TVGN. Macrovision/Rovi later renamed the product as i-Guide after the spin-off of the TV Guide publications.

====TV Guide On Screen====

A separate IPG system, &quot;TV Guide On Screen&quot;, was a brand name for Guide Plus+, a build of software featured in products such as televisions, DVD and digital video recorders, and other digital television devices providing on-screen program listings. First marketed in the mid-1990s, it was originally owned by Gemstar-TV Guide International before being acquired by the Rovi Corporation on December 7, 2007, in a $2.8 billion cash and stock deal. From November 2012 to April 2013, Rovi gradually discontinued broadcast transmission of the Guide Plus+ service.

==Other usage of the &quot;TV Guide&quot; name==
* A Canadian edition of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, which followed the same format as the U.S. magazine but published editorial content directed from Canada, was launched in 1977 (prior to this, beginning in 1953, the U.S. edition was published in Canada with appropriate localized television listings). It continued as a print publication until November 2006 (with only special editions being printed thereafter), after which it was replaced by the website tvguide.ca, which operated until December 2012, when it was incorporated into the entertainment and lifestyle website The Loop by Sympatico. The Canadian publication&#x27;s owner Transcontinental Media discontinued &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s online editorial content on July 2, 2014, ceasing the Canadian edition&#x27;s existence after 61 years. Its listings department, which distributes programming schedules to newspapers and The Loop owner Bell Canada&#x27;s pay television services (Bell Satellite TV, Bell Aliant TV and Bell Fibe TV) remains operational. In 2017, the U.S. edition of &quot;TV Guide&quot; was distributed in Canada for a time.
* The term &quot;TV guide&quot; has partly become a genericized trademark to describe other television listings appearing on the internet and in newspapers. Read/Write Web published &quot;Your Guide to Online TV Guides: 10 Services Compared.&quot; Techcrunch in 2006 offered &quot;Overview: The End of Paper TV Guides&quot;.
* &quot;TV Guides&quot; is also the name of an interactive video and sound installation produced in 1995 with assistance from the Canada Council, and was presented at SIGGRAPH 1999.
* TVGuide.co.uk is an unaffiliated British TV listings site now owned by Digitalbox

National television listings magazines using the &quot;TV Guide&quot; name (verbatim or translated into the magazine&#x27;s language of origin) are also published in other countries, but none of these are believed to be affiliated with the North American publication:
* In Australia, during the 1970s, a version of &quot;TV Guide&quot; was published under license by Southdown Press. In 1980, that version merged with competitor publication &quot;TV Week&quot;, which uses a very similar logo to that used by &quot;TV Guide&quot;.
* New Zealand has a digest-sized paper called &quot;TV Guide&quot;, which is not associated with the United States or Canadian publications. , it had the largest circulation of any national magazine, and is published by Fairfax Media.
* In Mexico, a digest-sized publication called &quot;TV Guía&quot; was founded in 1952 by the Amador brothers (Editorial Televisión, S.A.), who sold it in the eighties to Editorial Televisa. It is unrelated to the U.S. publication.
* In Italy, a digest-size &quot;Guida TV&quot; has been published since September 1976 by Mondadori.

<text>Ahrweiler () is a district in the north of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Euskirchen, Rhein-Sieg and the city of Bonn in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and the districts of Neuwied, Mayen-Koblenz and Vulkaneifel.

== History ==

The region was conquered by the Romans under Julius Caesar about 50 BC. Some hundred years later the Roman fort of Rigomagus (Gaulish for &quot;king&#x27;s field&quot;) was founded, later to become the city of Remagen. The Vinxtbach, a narrow brook and an affluent of the Rhine, was defined as the borderline between the Roman provinces of Germania superior and Germania inferior. There was originally a Roman villa here; the German suffix, &quot;weiler&quot;, is from the Latin term &quot;villare&quot;, meaning &quot;land attached to a Roman villa, farm&quot;. Portions of a Roman aqueduct have also been found nearby.

Many towns were first mentioned in the 9th century, among them Sinzig and the eponymous village of Ahrweiler (since 1969 a part of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler). The name of Ahrweiler was first noted in the Land Register of the Abbey of Prüm, which during the ninth century, owned almost all of the property in the town.

In 1180, the Holy Roman Emperor Barbarossa chose Sinzig as a place to meet the envoys of France and Flanders. Another significant place was the Abbey of Maria Laach on the Laacher See, a lake in the southeast of the district.

From 1100 to 1246, the district was ruled by the Grafen (Counts) von Are (Ahr), and then by their relatives, the Grafen von Hochstaden. These families were mainly responsible for the development of Ahrweiler, which then was, together with Bonn, Andernach and Nürburg, one of the capitals of the Archbishopric of Cologne. Defensive walls, ramparts and towers were built around the town, and these constructions remain mostly unimpaired.. In the early years of the Holy Roman Empire there was a county of Ahr, but it was annexed by the Bishop of Cologne in 1246. Afterwards Remagen became the most important town of the region. The parish church, St. Laurentius (St. Laurence) :de:St. Laurentius (Ahrweiler), was originally built in 1269.

Since the Middle Ages, the town has been roughly divided by the four City Gates. In each division there was a commons, which originally belonged to the town&#x27;s citizens. These were later put in the care of the protective Social Communities, who protected the interests of the inhabitants. These Social Communities (Hutengemeinschaften) continue to exist. They are: Hutengemeinschaft Adenbachhut Ahrweiler; Hutengemeinschaft &quot;St. Barbara&quot; Ahrhut Ahrweiler; Hutengemeinschaft &quot;St. Katharina&quot; Niederhut Ahrweiler; Hutengemeinschaft &quot;St. Ursula&quot; Oberhut Ahrweiler e.V..

During a disastrous period in the Thirty Years&#x27; War in the 17th century, the town was besieged, plundered and set on fire by the French. But the darkest day in Ahrweiler&#x27;s history was on May 1, 1689, when the town was razed to the ground, and only ten houses were left standing among the ruins.

The districts of Ahrweiler and Adenau were established in 1816, just after Prussia occupied the Rhineland. The district of Adenau was merged with Ahrweiler in 1932.

The Ahrweiler City Gate and many other historical buildings were partially destroyed at the end of World War II during the contested advances of the Allies. The battle of the Rhine bridge of Remagen, otherwise known as the Ludendorff Bridge, in 1945, is a well-known event in local history, also due to the U.S. movie The Bridge at Remagen (1969).

The 2021 European floods heavily impacted Ahrweiler, where the Ahr river rose, killing at least 135 people.

=== Jewish history ===
In Jewish texts, the town was called Aroil&#x27;ra (ארוילרא). From the 13th century and on, there was a considerable Jewish community in Ahrweiler. In the 14th century, the Jews of the town traded in salt and wine. During that period, the Jewish community of the town suffered from the Black Death Jewish persecutions. In 1900, 65 Jews lived in the town (1% of the total population), and 319 in 1933.
Although much of the town resisted early National Socialism, and the town leaders had refused Adolf Hitler a chance to address the community in 1932, they were not able to escape the reach of the Nazis entirely. Ahrweiler had a small Jewish community before the Nazis came to power, but they were all taken away and relocated, some to concentration camps, after 1933. No member of this community ever returned to Ahrweiler, and today, the town&#x27;s old synagogue that was desecrated during 1938 Kristallnacht, is used for art displays.

== Geography ==

The Rhine forms the eastern border of the district. The Ahr, a tributary of the Rhine, enters the district in the southeast and runs northeastwards to meet the Rhine within the borders of the district.

Ahrweiler is located in the northernmost part of the Eifel mountains. The mountains to the north of the Ahr are called the Ahr Hills; they are lower than the mountains of the High Eifel in the south of the district.

Walporzheim, one kilometre west of Ahrweiler, has some curious rock formations called the &quot;Bunte Kuh&quot; (Colorful Cow) and the &quot;Kaiserstuhl&quot; (Emperor&#x27;s Chair).

The forests of the Eifel are the result of reforestations in the 19th century. The most common tree is the fir, which was originally not native to the region. The Ahr river and its smaller affluents serve as a habitat for rare animals, that are adapted to alluvial forests. Examples are the oriole, the nightingale and the endangered black kite. Some fens in the area were drained in the 20th century. The Rodder Maar, a lake in the eastern part of the district, was drained in the 1950s, and a coniferous forest was planted on the former water body; in 1998 the lake was restored, and rare animals begin to arrive there again. The geology of the lake is uncertain. In its circular shape it appears similar to volcanic maars that are found in the nearby Daum region, but there is no evidence of volcanism, and so it is not a &quot;maar&quot;. In 2013 evidence that it is meteoritic in origin was presented.


Ahrweiler is also characterised by orchards and vineyards. The lower Ahr River is one of the northernmost wine regions of Germany, known for its red wines from Pinot noir (&quot;Spätburgunder&quot;) and Portugieser.

Ahrweiler is especially well known for its vineyards and wineries. Wine growing and trading has been going on in Ahrweiler for over 1,000 years. The town is the chief cultivator for the red wine known as &quot;Ahrburgunder&quot;. Bachem, which lies one kilometre south of Ahrweiler, is also well known for its &quot;Frühburgunder&quot;, a local name for Pinot Noir Précoce. Traditionally, in this small town more of this wine is produced than in any other place in the Ahr valley.

On the first Sunday in September there is a traditional and annual wine festival in Ahrweiler, for which a &quot;Wine Queen,&quot; or &quot;Burgundia&quot;, is elected. Within the district are also the wine festival on the first Sunday in July at Bachem and another one in nearby Walporzheim on the first Sunday in August. By the way, Walporzheim also has the oldest wine house in the Ahr, named St. Peters, which dates from 1246.

The Nürburgring, a famous Formula One circuit, is located in the district.

<text>Münster is one of the five &quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot; of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, located in the north of the state, and named after the capital city of Münster. It includes the area which in medieval times was known as the Dreingau.

Regierungsbezirk Münster mostly covers rural areas of Münsterland famous for their castles, e.g. Castle Nordkirchen and Castle Ahaus. The region offers more than a hundred castles, all linked up by the cycle path &quot;100 Schlösser Route&quot;.

The three southern municipalities are part of the Ruhrgebiet, a densely populated region with much industry. Besides this the area is mostly as green as the rest of Münsterland and historically a part of the landscape.

The history of the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; dates back to 1815, when it was one of the original 25 &quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot; created as a subdivision of the provinces of Prussia. The last reorganization of the districts was made in 1975, when the number of districts was reduced from ten to five, and the number of district-free cities from six to three.


==Climate==
The climate is mainly maritime, influenced by the recently deteriorating Gulf Stream.

Temperatures above 30 °C during the summer were rare until the 1980s. Recently some summer months got more hot and dry or cool and wet with an increased abundance of extreme weather.

In winter time temperatures deep frost below -10 °C occurs especially in times of Berlin Phenomenon and is rare in years without. Long time average temperatures about 1 °C in January and February mean that frost is quite common.

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 88.1 billion € in 2018, accounting for 2.6% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 30,900 € or 102% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 94% of the EU average.

==Traffic==
A popular way to explore the Münsterland is by bicycle. The mostly flat landscape with its architectural and cultural gems invites cycling, both ambitious on-road riding (e.g. the Münsterland Giro race) and relaxed tours on small rural roads and &quot;Pättkes&quot; (minor paths, some are even unpaved). Embedded in a 4,500 km long network of cycle paths are not only the most popular themed routes, but also many small and large delightful tours and round courses through the region. Some infrastructure for cyclists with Bed &amp; Bike farms, navigation systems, and service-stations make Münsterland a fine cycling area.

The city of Münster itself is crammed with bikes and on a daily basis cyclists face traffic congestion, bike theft, parking problems and the like.

The road system is well-maintained and several highways offer fast access to nearly all areas.

In those areas where railroads haven&#x27;t been closed down by the 1980s, frequent and fast service is offered. One streetcar system has survived in the city of Gelsenkirchen and many other towns and cities offer a fair bus network.
Rural areas are connected by bus, too. The service is tied to demand and rather poor in very remote places.

The Münsterland can be explored by boat on some canals, e.g. the Dortmund–Ems Canal and Wesel–Datteln Canal. They connect the area to the harbours in Duisburg and Münster, the German coast and the rest of the German waterway system.

<doc id="188844" wikidata="Q913462" url="?curid=188844" title="Gaumont (company)">
<text>Gaumont SA () is a French film and television production and distribution company headquartered in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. Founded by the engineer-turned-inventor Léon Gaumont (1864–1946) in 1895, it is the oldest extant film company in the world, established before other studios such as Pathé (founded in 1896), Titanus (1904), Nordisk Film (1906), Universal, Paramount, and Nikkatsu (all founded in 1912).

Gaumont predominantly produces, co-produces, and distributes films, and in 2011, 95% of Gaumont&#x27;s consolidated revenues came from the film division. The company is also a producer of TV series through Gaumont Télévision and animation through Gaumont Animation as well as its existing French production features. Gaumont is run by Nicolas Seydoux (chairman) and Sidonie Dumas (CEO).

==History==

Originally dealing in photographic apparatus, the company began producing short films in 1897 to promote its make of camera-projector. Léon Gaumont&#x27;s secretary Alice Guy-Blaché became the motion picture industry&#x27;s first female director, and she went on to become the Head of Production of the Gaumont film studio from 1897 to 1907. From 1905 to 1914, its Cité Elgé studios (from the normal French pronunciation of the founder&#x27;s initials L-G) in La Villette, France were the largest in the world. Gaumont began producing full-length feature films in 1908.

The company manufactured its own equipment and mass-produced films until 1907, when Louis Feuillade became the artistic director of Gaumont. When World War I broke out, he was replaced by Léonce Perret, who continued his career in the United States a few years later. In 1909 the company participated in the Paris Film Congress, a failed attempt by European producers to create a cartel similar to that of the MPPC in the United States.

Gaumont opened foreign offices and acquired the theatre chain Gaumont British, which later notably produced several films directed by Alfred Hitchcock such as &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938). Along with its competitor Pathé Frères, Gaumont dominated the motion picture industry in Europe until the outbreak of World War I in 1914.

After World War I, Gaumont suffered economic losses owing to increased competition from American Hollywood productions. In 1925, the studio&#x27;s output decreased to only three films. In addition, Gaumont was unable to keep pace with the cost of technological changes (e.g., the advent of sound movies). Struck by mounting debts in the early 1930s and the effects of the Great Depression, Gaumont declared bankruptcy in 1935. In 1937, the studio ceased production and operated only as a theater and distribution company. The company was purchased by the French corporation Havas in 1938, was renamed Société Nouvelle des Etablissements Gaumont, and reopened its film production studio. During the later years of World War II, Gaumont was affected by the financial ruin of France&#x27;s economy as well as the physical destruction of its facilities. The company ceased production until 1947. During that time, Gaumont partnered with Compagnie Parisienne de Location de Films to produce and distribute films and co-marketed together, until CPLF was renamed to Gaumont Distribution. However, the global interest in French New Wave films in the 1950s, as well as the permissiveness within French films (e.g., nudity), allowed French productions to successfully compete against an American cinema that was still burdened by conservative moral codes. The period was to see the return to prominence of Gaumont Studios.

In 1970, media tycoon and French old money heir multimillionaire Nicolas Seydoux started managing Gaumont and becomes a vice-president at the company. Within two years he puts into place a restructuring phase and halted its productions, with Seydoux imposing his veto on certain projects. he personally owned 60% of the shares and 70% of the votes. It was likely that the new policy imposed was to change its production structure, with less &quot;mainstream&quot; films. Although he had a significant number of box-office hits, Alain Poiré had his place in danger, following the failure of &quot;Rum Runners&quot;, which was a costly production.

In 1972, Schlumberger put up Gaumont for sale: &quot;Rum Runners&quot; didn&#x27;t help recoup its losses. Ambitious producer Jean-Pierre Rassam intended to acquire Gaumont with Seydoux and Toscan du Plantier and had promised various projects to bail out the company, but the balance sheet of his company Ciné qua non did not play into this his favor between the budget overruns or commercial failures of the films &quot;Chinese in Paris&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch the White Woman!&quot; and &quot;Lancelot du Lac&quot;. The Schlumberger group sells its shares, estimated at 40%, to Nicolas Seydoux and Daniel Toscan du Plantier.

With these events, Nicolas Seydoux succeeds his brother Jérome Seydoux at the front of the company. The policy he undertook reconciled popular films and those with a more restricted audience: Alain Poiré ultimately remained in his position, to continue the production of major popular films, and Seydoux appointed Daniel Toscan du Plantier as its general manager. René Bonnell, Gaumont&#x27;s distribution director from 1978 to 1982, explains that Seydoux had to coexist a Tuscan du Plantier, who arrived in 1976-1977 and who wanted to change everything, with a more traditional Poiré. On the economic level, Poiré was the financial support of the group thanks to all its big successes (&quot;La Boum&quot;, &quot;La Chèvre&quot;, the Belmondo films etc.), and their theatrical runs in the halls was modernized by Nicolas Seydoux. Concerning Toscan, that the economic balance of his interventions was proven, but he was the essential complement, young, open, to a house which needed this touch of madness. A house whose imaginary value, apart from balance sheet values, was increased by this extraordinary abundance around Tuscan.

In the 1990s, the company operated TV and multimedia divisions, which was divested at the end of the 1990s. The television division was sold to company executive Christian Carret, who turned it into GTV, while the multimedia division&#x27;s animation unit were sold to management and renamed Xilam, and the multimedia division continued producing video games until 2004.
On 2 February 2000, Philippe Binant, technical manager of Digital Cinema Project at Gaumont, realized the first digital cinema projection in Europe with the Texas Instruments prototype projector. From 1993 to early 2004, Gaumont and Disney had a partnership for producing films for theater distribution.

In 2001, Gaumont spun off the cinema division into a joint venture with Pathé since known as Les Cinémas Gaumont Pathé. Gaumont owned a 34% stake in the entity, which controls a large cinema network in France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. As of 2011, this stake was worth €214 million. In 2004, Gaumont continued its development with Pathé to set up another joint venture, Gaumont-Pathé Archives. Gaumont owns 57.5% of this entity, which contains newsreels, documentaries, and silent movies from the 20th and 21st centuries. From early 2004 to 2007, the company had a partnership with Sony for producing films and for theater and DVD distribution worldwide. And for many years, Gaumont&#x27;s home video division was a joint venture with Sony Pictures. Currently, Gaumont distributes its films through Paramount Home Media Distribution on video in France. At the end of 2007, Gaumont took over the French animation studio Alphanim for €25 million and renamed it Gaumont Alphanim. As of 2013, it is known as Gaumont Animation. 

On 16 December 2010, Gaumont acquired a 37.48% stake in the share capital of the Légende company and its subsidiaries for €6.6 million. Légende is a full-length film and television series production and distribution company managed by Alain Goldman. As of 2011, the Légende stake is worth €6.3 million. 2011 was the year that Gaumont opened its Gaumont International Television division in Los Angeles. In 2011, Gaumont co-produced and co-distributed &quot;The Intouchables&quot;, which became France&#x27;s highest-grossing movie of all time. The international release of &quot;The Intouchables&quot; was equally successful, trumping previous international blockbusters such as &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;Transporters&quot; in Germany. &quot;Intouchables&quot; is the highest-grossing foreign-language movie (any language other than English) beating the previous record of $275 million by the Japanese &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. The film was a major catalyst for Gaumont&#x27;s boosting fourth-quarter 2011 cinema sales to €47.9 million, up 651% year on year. The film&#x27;s success turned a half-year 2011 loss to a record annual €26 million profit. &quot;The Intouchables&quot; currently has a box office of $361 million.

In 2012, Gaumont acquired the production company Nouvelles Éditions de Films (NEF) for €3.1 million. The company was previously run and created by cinema legend Louis Malle. As part of the acquisition, Gaumont now owns the entire Malle collection, including &quot;Ascenseur pour l&#x27;échafaud&quot;, &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, and &quot;Au Revoir les Enfants&quot;. In February 2012, Gaumount restarted its television division which had been defunct for about ten years.On 2 May 2016 according to &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;, Gaumont teamed with Lionsgate, and seven other international companies to launch the Globalgate Entertainment consortium. Globalgate will produce and distribute local-language films in markets around the world. Lionsgate said it had partnered with international entertainment executives Paul Presburger, William Pfeiffer and Clifford Werber to launch Globalgate. In 2019, Gaumont was replaced by TF1 Studio as Globalgate&#x27;s new French member. On 1 March 2017, Gaumont sold its 34% stake in Les Cinémas Gaumont Pathé to Pathé for $400 million in order to focus on production.

In January 2018, it was announced that the company&#x27;s first office, in Cologne, Germany, would open in July 2018. The office was to focus on development and production of premiere drama programming, according to film producer and new manager Sabine de Mardt.

==Production==

Gaumont currently has 938 films in its catalogue, most of which are in French; however there are some exceptions such as Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997). Among the most notable films produced by Gaumont are the serials &quot;Judex&quot; (1916) and &quot;Fantômas&quot; (1913); the comic Onésime series, starring Ernest Bourbon; and the comic Bébé series, starring five-year-old René Dary. The two biggest films to which Gaumont owns the rights are Jean-Marie Poiré&#x27;s &quot;Les Visiteurs&quot;, with a box-office of $98 million, and the 2011 blockbuster &quot;Intouchables&quot; by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, with a box office of $427 million.

Abel Gance, a director and the early animator Emile Cohl worked for the studio at one time or another. The company has also produced television shows, including seven animated series: &quot;&quot;, &quot;Space Goofs&quot;, &quot;The Magician&quot;, &quot;Dragon Flyz&quot;, &quot;F Is for Family&quot;, and &quot;Sky Dancers&quot; (the second and third are based on their respective toy lines), and the very popular &quot;Oggy and the Cockroaches&quot;. The company also began production in its American unit Gaumont International Television on two series: &quot;Hannibal&quot; and &quot;Hemlock Grove&quot;. The studio has been described as a mini-major studio.

==Corporate structure==
Ciné Par is a majority shareholder with 69.92% of the voting rights: this entity is controlled by CEO Nicolas Seydoux. The other private shareholders are First Eagle Investment Management, Bolloré, and Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault. The company has a free float of 416,784 shares, which represents 9.75% of the capital and 5.99% of the voting rights.

==Financial information==
In the first half of 2012, Gaumont recorded a profit of €7.7 million, which reversed the €0.6 million loss from the first half of 2011. The profit was driven by a 49% increase in revenue, which reached €50.1 million. The company cited the continued effects of &quot;Intouchables&quot;, which increased International revenues by 153%. Gaumont&#x27;s market capitalization as of January 2010 is €164 million.

==Logo==
Léon Gaumont selected the ox-eye daisy as the company logo to pay homage to his mother, whose first name was Marguerite (Daisy). Its first appearance dates back to March 16, 1903 when Léon Gaumont registered the first version of the daisy (slightly resembling a sunflower), with the &quot;Elgé&quot; inscription in the center, French phonetic version of the founder&#x27;s initials. (&quot;L. G.&quot;) Elge was renamed &quot;Gaumont&quot; lorsque when the company was renamed Société des Établissements Gaumont in 1906. Léon Gaumont requires the brand to be present in “at least one scene from each strip and even two scenes&quot;.

Throughout the decades the logo has been redesigned several times, but the daisy has always remained present, even though its significance has been largely forgotten. The latest redesign is from 2010, and takes up the principle of the halo of petals: the red daisy has twelve irregular petals which take the form of a luminous halo around the letter G. The logo, made by Lorène Bruant for the Les Quatre Lunes agency, is inspired by the praxinoscope to create dynamism and adopts a tailor-made, sans-serif typography. Designed for the screen again by the Bronx agency, it is soundtracked by the first bars of the well-known aria (cavatina) &quot;Casta Diva&quot; from the opera &quot;Norma&quot; composed by Vincenzo Bellini.

<doc id="188848" wikidata="Q193073" url="?curid=188848" title="Iconostasis">
<text>In Eastern Christianity, an iconostasis () is a wall of icons and religious paintings, separating the nave from the sanctuary in a church. &quot;Iconostasis&quot; also refers to a portable icon stand that can be placed anywhere within a church. The iconostasis evolved from the Byzantine templon, a process complete by the 15th century.

A direct comparison for the function of the main iconostasis can be made to the layout of the great Temple in Jerusalem. That Temple was designed with three parts. The holiest and inner-most portion was that where the Ark of the Covenant was kept. This portion, the Holy of Holies, was separated from the second larger part of the building&#x27;s interior by a curtain, the &quot;veil of the temple&quot;. Only the High Priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies. The third part was the entrance court. 

This architectural tradition for the two main parts can be seen carried forward in Christian churches and is still most demonstratively present in Eastern Orthodox churches where the iconostasis divides the altar, the Holy of Holies where the Eucharist is performed – the manifestation of the New Covenant – from the larger portion of the church accessible to the faithful. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, usually only men can enter the altar portion behind the iconostasis. However, one will see women serving behind the iconostasis at female monasteries. 

The word &quot;iconostasis&quot; comes from the Greek (), still in common use in Greece and Cyprus), which means .

== Location ==
The nave is the main body of the church where most of the worshippers stand, and the sanctuary is the area around the altar, east of the nave. The sanctuary is usually one to three steps higher than the nave. The iconostasis does not sit directly on the edge of the sanctuary but is usually set a few feet back from the edge of the top step. This forms a walkway in front of the iconostasis for the clergy, called a soleas. In the very center of the soleas is an extension (or thrust), often rounded, called the ambon, on which the deacon will stand to give litanies during the services.

The iconostasis, though often tall, rarely touches the ceiling. Acoustically, this permits the ekphoneses (liturgical exclamations) of the clergy to be heard clearly by the faithful. In small, modern churches the iconostasis may be completely absent: in such cases it is replaced by a few small icons on analogia (lecterns), forming a virtual divide.

The iconostasis typically has three openings or sets of doors: the &quot;Beautiful Gates&quot; or &quot;Holy Doors&quot; in the center, and the North and South Doors to either side. The Beautiful Gates are sometimes called the &quot;Royal Doors&quot;, but that name more properly belongs to the central doors connecting the narthex, or porch, to the nave. They remain shut whenever a service is not being held. Modern custom as to when they should be opened during services varies depending upon jurisdiction and local custom.

The North and South Doors are often called &quot;Deacons&#x27; Doors&quot; because the deacons use them frequently. Icons of sainted deacons are often depicted on these doors (particularly St. Stephen the Protomartyr and St. Ephrem the Syrian). Alternatively, they may be called &quot;Angels&#x27; Doors&quot;, and the Archangels Michael and Gabriel are often depicted there. The South Door is typically the &quot;entrance&quot; door, and Michael is depicted there because he is the &quot;Defender&quot;; the North Door is the &quot;exit&quot;, and Gabriel is depicted here because he is the &quot;Messenger&quot; of God. (In the Greek and Antiochian liturgical tradition, the Archangel Michael is usually stationed on the north (i.e. &quot;exit&quot;) door, and Gabriel on the south (i.e. &quot;entrance&quot;) door, and that it is far more common in modern times to see the Archangels than the Deacons on these doors). These doors may also be casually referred to as the &quot;side doors&quot;.

There are some exceptions where both the side doors depict Archangel Michael. The most notable exception is of the church of Saint George (Aghios Georgios) inside the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (in today&#x27;s Istanbul).

In many monastery churches and chapels (though often not in the katholikon, the monastery&#x27;s main church) one may find iconostases with only two doors: the Holy Doors and the North Door. These churches are used for simpler monastic observances when only a hieromonk would be serving alone.

== Placement of icons ==
A number of guidelines or rubrics govern which icons are on which parts of the iconostasis, although there is some room for variation. In its fullest Slavic development, it comprised five tiers of icons:
# The bottom tier is sometimes called &quot;Sovereign&quot;. On the right side of the Beautiful Gates (from the nave facing forward) is an icon of Christ (often &quot;Pantokrator&quot;), which symbolizes his Second Coming and on the left side is an icon of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), symbolizing Christ&#x27;s Incarnation, and entrance into this world. Therefore, all things take place between Christ&#x27;s first and second coming. Other icons on this tier beside those on the doors themselves usually include depictions of the patron saint or feast day to which the church is dedicated, John the Baptist, Saint Nicholas, one or more of the Four Evangelists etc. Above this are two interchangeable tiers: the &quot;Deisis&quot; and the &quot;Twelve Great Feasts&quot;:
# In the center of the &quot;Deisis&quot; is a large icon of Christ Enthroned. To the left and right are icons of John the Baptist and the Theotokos in attitudes of supplication. They are often flanked by icons of the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, then Sts. Peter and Paul, and then any other important Church Fathers that may be desired for inclusion as space allows.
# The &quot;Feasts&quot; tier contains icons of the twelve Great Feasts of the liturgical year. Above this, the top two tiers are also interchangeable with each other:
# The Old Testament Prophets and Patriarchs—the latter including the 12 sons of Jacob—often to either side of an icon of Our Lady of the Sign; and
# the Twelve Apostles, often to either side of and icon depicting either Christ at the Second Coming or the Holy Trinity.

It is also not uncommon to find an icon of the &quot;Mystical Supper&quot;, which depicts the Last Supper, and by extension the Communion of Saints in the Kingdom of God, somewhere above the Beautiful Gates.

The Sovereign (bottom) tier is found in all iconostases, but other tiers are somewhat optional. In general, preference is given to the Deisis or the Feasts tiers if only some of them can be included, and only the largest and most elaborate iconostases have all five tiers.

Many modern iconostases in the Greek tradition only include the bottom (&quot;Sovereign&quot;) tier, and on occasion a second tier of smaller icons, usually depicting either the Great Feasts or the Apostles (with an icon of the Mystical Supper, or occasionally the Hospitality of Abraham) above the Beautiful Gates.

When the Iconostasis does not reach all the way to the ceiling, it is often surmounted by a central cross, centered directly above the Beautiful Gates. If the cross bears an iconographic depiction of Christ Crucified, it is often flanked by icons of the Theotokos and St. John the Evangelist standing at the foot of the cross.

There are rules regarding who may enter or leave the sanctuary (altar), and by which door. Neither the Beautiful Gates (Holy/Royal Doors – central doors) nor the space between them and the altar table may be used by laity under any circumstances, although infants are either carried into the altar through them in the &quot;churching&quot; rite if they are boys, or if they are girls, the infant is simply presented at the doors. Bishops may enter through the Beautiful Gates at any time; priests and deacons may do so only at specific times during the services when the gates are open (but during Bright Week they always enter and exit through them). All others enter the sanctuary through the side doors.

In a convent, only the abbess and elder nuns are permitted to enter the sanctuary (altar), and they may only enter through the side doors. The abbess may enter at any time, but the other nuns need a blessing to enter.

Male members of the laity who are usually allowed to enter the sanctuary include those involved in the running of the particular church, i.e., cantors and choristers, altar servers/acolytes, church keepers and vestrymen, etc.

In the Romanian tradition, on the day of the consecration of the altar in the church, the laity, including women, were permitted to enter and venerate the altar until the beginning of the Vespers of Consecration. These guidelines were developed over the course of many centuries, with both theologically symbolic and practical reasons for them.

==Theological implications==
The iconostasis does not separate the nave from the Holy of Holies; rather, it is seen as bringing them together. The iconostasis is the link between heaven (the Holy of Holies) and the nave (the Holy Place). Therefore, everything is symbolic upon the iconostasis. The icons of Christ, the Theotokos, and various saints and feasts are there because Christ, the Theotokos, the saints etc., are said to lead and guide followers into the Holy of Holies. Therefore, the personages on the icons upon the iconostasis guide followers into heaven, and therefore the iconostasis is said to connect, not separate. Icons are seen as windows and bridges to heaven. Therefore, in a sense the iconostasis represents Christ, who is the connection, the door, between both realms. The perfect explanation for the iconostasis, and its uniting purpose, is seen in Hebrews 10:19–20, &quot;Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way which he opened for us through the curtain, that is through his flesh.&quot;.

== Evolution ==
Archaeological evidence from the St. John of Stoudios monastery in Constantinople suggests that the iconostasis evolved from the early templon. A basilica dedicated to John the Baptist was built in 463 AD. In it the chancel barrier surrounded the altar in a π shape, with one large door facing the nave and two smaller doors on the other sides. Twelve piers held chancel slabs of about 1.6 meters in length. The height of the slabs is not known. The chancel barrier was not merely a low parapet (a short wall); remains of colonnettes have been found, suggesting that the barrier carried an architrave on top of the columns.

In early churches, including the Hagia Sophia (&quot;Great Church&quot;) in Constantinople, the altar, at least in large churches, was under a ciborium (: in Greek), usually a structure with four columns and a domed canopy. This had curtains on rods on all four sides, which were closed for sections of the liturgy, as is still performed in the Coptic and Armenian churches, a comparison with the biblical Veil of the Temple was intended. The small domed structures, usually with red curtains, that are often shown near the writing saint in early Evangelist portraits, especially in the East, represent a ciborium, as do the structures surrounding many manuscript portraits of medieval rulers. As the iconostasis grew, the ciborium declined, although some late examples, by now invisible to the congregation, were produced.

The templon gradually replaced all other forms of chancel barriers in Byzantine churches in the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries, except in Cappadocia. The invention of the solid icon screen is ascribed to Saint Basil the Great.

As late as the 10th century, a simple wooden chancel barrier separated the apse from the nave in the rock-cut churches in Derinkuyu, although by the late 11th century, the templon had become standard. This may have been because of the veneration and imitation of the Great Church Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, though the columnar form of chancel barrier does predate Hagia Sophia.

The rood screens or pulpita that most large European Roman Catholic churches and cathedrals had acquired by late medieval times occupied a similar position between chancel and nave but served a different function. The choir was usually east of the screen. Many survive, often most completely in Scandinavia, and more were built in the Gothic Revival, particularly in Anglican churches in England. In wooden examples, painted panels were typically waist-high, with a wooden tracery section above allowing a view through, and then a large carved beam supporting a rood cross crucifix, often life-size, above that. Larger churches had stone screens, which might impede virtually all view by the congregation.

<text>A is a Japanese longitudinal, end-blown flute that is made of bamboo. The bamboo end-blown flute now known as the was developed in Japan in the 16th century and is called the . A bamboo flute known as the or was derived from the Chinese xiao in the Nara period and died out in the 10th century. After a long blank period, the appeared in the 15th century, and then in the 16th century, the was developed in Japan. The flourished in the 18th century during the Edo period, and eventually the also died out. The developed in Japan is longer and thicker than the and has one finger hole less. It is longer and thicker than and is superior in volume, range, scale and tone quality. Today, since the &quot;shakuhachi&quot; generally refers only to , the theory that the is an instrument unique to Japan is widely accepted.

The is traditionally made of bamboo, but versions now exist in ABS, ebonite, anodized aluminum, and hardwoods. It was used by the monks of the Fuke Zen of Zen Buddhism in the practice of (blowing meditation).

The instrument is tuned to the minor pentatonic scale.

==Etymology==

The name means &quot;1.8 &quot;, referring to its size. It is a compound of two words:
# is an archaic unit of length equal to and subdivided in ten subunits.
# means &quot;eight&quot;, here eight , or tenths, of a .

Thus, the compound word means &quot;one eight &quot; (), the standard length of a . Other vary in length from about 1.1 up to 3.6 . Although the sizes differ, all are still referred to generically as .

==Overview==
 are usually made from the root end of (&quot;Phyllostachys bambusoides&quot;) bamboo culm and are extremely versatile instruments. Professional players can produce virtually any pitch they wish from the instrument, and play a wide repertoire of original Zen music, ensemble music with , , and , folk music, jazz, and other modern pieces.

Much of the &#x27;s subtlety (and player&#x27;s skill) lies in its rich tone colouring, and the ability for its variation. Different fingerings, embouchures and amounts of can produce notes of the same pitch, but with subtle or dramatic differences in the tone colouring. Holes can be covered partially and pitch varied subtly or substantially by changing the blowing angle. The pieces rely heavily on this aspect of the instrument to enhance their subtlety and depth.

Unlike a recorder, where the player blows into a duct—a narrow airway over a block which is called a &quot;fipple&quot;—and thus has limited pitch control, the player blows as one would blow across the top of an empty bottle (though the has a sharp edge to blow against called ) and therefore has substantial pitch control. The term literally translates as &quot;to the mouth that sings&quot;, referring to the upper and main hole of the flute where the mouthpiece or blowing edge is created by a natural diagonal cut in the bamboo.

The history of the shows a variety of designs of inlaid mouthpieces that vary between certain traditional Japanese schools of . Thus, the Kinko Ryu, Myoan and Tozan Ryu, differ in different features in their line of mouthpiece design, coinciding in them the total non-use in their inlay of the semi-circumference formed by the natural cut of the mouthpiece in the bamboo. Beyond the fact that these inlaid forms were a hallmark of styles and schools, the fact of inlaying a mouthpiece historically could respond to a way of repairing the instrument due to wear or damage in particular in its blowing edge.

The five finger holes are tuned to a minor pentatonic scale with no half-tones, but using techniques called and , in which the blowing angle is adjusted to bend the pitch downward and upward, respectively, combined with embouchure adjustments and fingering techniques the player can bend each pitch as much as a whole tone or more. Pitches may also be lowered by or partially covering finger holes. Since most pitches can be achieved via several different fingering or blowing techniques on the , the timbre of each possibility is taken into account when composing or playing thus different names are used to write notes of the same pitch which differ in timbre. The has a range of two full octaves (the lower is called / , the upper, ) and a partial third octave ( ) though experienced players can produce notes up to E7 (2637.02Hz) on a 1.8 &quot;shakuhachi&quot;. The various octaves are produced using subtle variations of breath, finger positions and embouchure.

In traditional repertoire, instead of tonguing for articulation like many Western wind instruments, hitting holes (, ) with a very fast movement is used and each note has its corresponding repeat fingerings; e.g., for repeating C5 the 5th hole (D5&#x27;s tone hole) is used.

A 1.8 produces D4 (D above Middle C, 293.66Hz) as its fundamental—the lowest note it produces with all five finger holes covered, and a normal blowing angle. In contrast, a 2.4 has a fundamental of A3 (A below Middle C, 220Hz). As the length increases, the spacing of the finger holes also increases, stretching both fingers and technique. Longer flutes often have offset finger holes, and very long flutes are almost always custom made to suit individual players. Some , in particular those of the Nezasaha (Kimpu-ryū) school, are intended to be played on these longer flutes.

Due to the skill required, the time involved, and the range of quality in materials to craft bamboo , one can expect to pay from US$1,000 to US$8,000 for a new or used flute. Because each piece of bamboo is unique, cannot be mass-produced, and craftsmen must spend much time finding the correct shape and length of bamboo, curing it for more or less of a decade in a controlled environment and then start shaping the bore for almost a year using paste—many layers of a mixture including and and finished with lacquer—for each individual flute to achieve correct pitch and tonality over all notes. Specimens of extremely high quality, with valuable inlays, or of historical significance can fetch US$20,000 or more. Plastic or PVC have some advantages over their traditional bamboo counterparts: they are lightweight, extremely durable, nearly impervious to heat and cold, and typically cost less than US$100. made of wood are also available, typically costing less than bamboo but more than synthetic materials. Nearly all players, however, prefer bamboo, citing tonal qualities, aesthetics, and tradition.

==History==

The is derived from the Chinese bamboo-flute. The bamboo-flute first came to Japan from China during the 7th or 8th century. This style of bamboo flute, also called or , was used for playing , but died out in the 10th century. Eight remain in the Shōsō-in Treasure Repository. There are no records of musical scores related to the , so details such as its playing method and scale are unknown. The average length was , the diameter of the finger holes was , and there were 6 finger holes – 5 at the front, 1 at the back.

In the 15th century, the appeared. It is characterized by a single bamboo joint in the middle of the tube. Although it flourished in the 17th century, it gradually fell into disuse due to the development and popularity of the superior , and was no longer used by the 19th century. The average length was , the outer diameter was , and there were 5 finger holes – 4 at the front, 1 at the back.

The flute now known as the was developed in Japan in the 16th century and is called the . This style of is longer and thicker than the older , and its volume, range, scale, and tone are superior to those of the older . It is made from the base of the bamboo, and the average length is , which corresponds to 1 8 ; the outside diameter is , and there are 5 finger holes – 4 at the front, 1 at the back.

During the medieval period, were most notable for their role in the Fuke sect of Zen Buddhist monks, known as (&quot;priests of nothingness&quot; or &quot;emptiness monks&quot;), who used the &quot;shakuhachi&quot; as a spiritual tool. Their songs (called ) were paced according to the players&#x27; breathing and were considered meditation () as much as music.

Travel around Japan was restricted by the shogunate at this time, but the Fuke sect managed to wrangle an exemption from the , since their spiritual practice required them to move from place to place playing the and begging for alms (one famous song reflects this mendicant tradition: ; &quot;One two three, pass the alms bowl&quot;). They persuaded the to give them exclusive rights to play the instrument. In return, some were required to spy for the shogunate, and the sent several of his own spies out in the guise of Fuke monks as well. This was made easier by the that the Fuke wore over their heads, a symbol of their detachment from the world.

In response to these developments, several particularly difficult pieces, e.g. , became well known as &quot;tests&quot;: if one could play them, they were a real Fuke monk. If they could not, they were probably a spy and might very well be killed if they were in unfriendly territory.

With the Meiji Restoration, beginning in 1868, the shogunate was abolished and so was the Fuke sect, in order to help identify and eliminate the &#x27;s holdouts. The very playing of the was officially forbidden for a few years. Non-Fuke folk traditions did not suffer greatly from this, since the tunes could be played just as easily on another pentatonic instrument. However, the repertoire was known exclusively to the Fuke sect and transmitted by repetition and practice, and much of it was lost, along with many important documents.

When the Meiji government did permit the playing of again, it was only as an accompanying instrument to the , , etc. It was not until later that were allowed to be played publicly again as solo pieces.

The has traditionally been played almost exclusively by men in Japan, although this situation is rapidly changing. Many teachers of traditional music indicate that a majority of their students are women. The 2004 Big Apple Festival in New York City hosted the first-ever concert of international women masters. This festival was organized and produced by Ronnie Nyogetsu Reishin Seldin, who was the first full-time master to teach in the Western hemisphere. Nyogetsu also holds 2 Dai Shihan (Grand Master) licenses, and has run KiSuiAn, the largest and most active Dojo outside Japan, since 1975.
The has grown in international popularity in recent decades. The first non-Japanese person to become a master was American-Australian Riley Lee. Lee was responsible for the World Festival being held in Sydney, Australia over 5–8 July 2008, based at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Riley Lee played the in Dawn Mantras which was composed by Ross Edwards especially for the Dawn Performance, which took place on the sails of the Sydney Opera House at sunrise on 1 January 2000 and was televised internationally.

==Acoustics==
The creates a harmonic spectrum that contains the fundamental frequency together with even and odd harmonics and some blowing noise. Five tone holes enable musicians to play the notes D-F-G-A-C-D. Cross (or fork) fingerings, half-covering tone holes, and blowing cause pitch sharpening, referred to as intonation anomaly. Especially the second and third harmonic exhibit the well-known timbre. Even though the geometry of the is relatively simple, the sound radiation of the is rather complicated. Sound radiating from several holes and the natural asymmetry of bamboo create an individual spectrum in each direction. This spectrum depends on frequency and playing technique.

==Notable players==

The International Shakuhachi Society maintains a directory of notable professional, amateur, and teaching players.

==Recordings==

The primary genres of music are:

* (traditional, solo)
* (ensemble, with and )
* (new music composed for and , commonly post-Meiji period compositions influenced by Western music)

Recordings in each of these categories are available; however, more albums are catalogued in categories outside the traditional realm. As of 2018, players continue releasing records in a variety of traditional and modern styles.

The first recording appeared in the United States in the late 1960s. Gorō Yamaguchi recorded &quot;A Bell Ringing in the Empty Sky&quot; for Nonesuch Explorer Records on LP, an album which received acclaim from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; at the time of its release. One of the pieces featured on Yamaguchi&#x27;s record was , also called (Crane&#x27;s Nesting). NASA later chose to include this track as part of the Golden Record aboard the Voyager spacecraft.

==In the film industry==
 are often used in modern film scores, for example those by James Horner. Films in which it is featured prominently include: &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; parts II and III by Bill Conti, &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot; by James Horner, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and its sequels by John Williams and Don Davis, and &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; by Hans Zimmer and &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; by John Williams.

Renowned Japanese classical and film-score composer Toru Takemitsu wrote many pieces for and orchestra, including his well-known &quot;Celeste&quot;, &quot;Autumn&quot; and &quot;November Steps&quot;.

==Western contemporary music==

* The Australian master and composer Jim Franklyn has composed a number of works for solo , also including electronics.
* British composer John Palmer included a wide range of extended techniques in (1999, for and ensemble)
* In Carlo Forlivesi&#x27;s composition for and guitar &quot;&quot; (), the performance techniques were remarked as &quot;[presenting] notable difficulties in a few completely novel situations: an audacious movement of &#x27;expansion&#x27; of the respective traditions of the two instruments pushed as they are at times to the limits of the possible, the aim being to have the and the guitar playing on the same level and with virtuosity (two instruments that are culturally and acoustically so dissimilar), thus increasing the expressive range, the texture of the dialogue, the harmonic dimension and the tone-colour.&quot;
* American composer and performer Elizabeth Brown plays and has written many pieces for the instrument that build on Japanese traditions while diverging with more modern arrangement, orchestration, melodic twists or harmonic progressions.
* New York-born musician James Nyoraku Schlefer plays, teaches, and composes for . 
* Composer Carson Kievman has employed the instrument in many works from &quot;Ladies Voices&quot; in 1976 to &quot;Feudal Japan&quot; in the parallel world opera &quot;Passion Love Gravity&quot; in 2020–21.
* Brian Ritchie of the Violent Femmes formed a jazz quintet in 2002 called &quot;The N.Y.C.&quot; &quot;Club&quot;. They play avant-garde jazz versions of tradition American folk and blues songs with Ritchie&#x27;s playing as the focal point. In 2004 they released their debut album on Weed Records.
* Welsh composer Karl Jenkins features prominent solos in his 2005 &quot;Requiem&quot;, specifically in the movements where the texts are death haikus.
* American multi-instrumentalist and composer Zac Zinger is a specialist, featuring it on his progressive-jazz album &quot;Fulfillment&quot;, as well as playing it on the score of &quot;Just Cause 4&quot; and the promotional album for &quot;Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty&quot;, from .
* &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Listening&quot;, a 2003 rap rock song from the album &quot;Meteora&quot; by Linkin Park, features the flute.
* British jazz musician Shabaka Hutchings performed shakuhachi on the André 3000 album New Blue Sun

==Synthesized/sampled ==
The sound of the is also featured from time to time in electronica, pop and rock, especially after being commonly shipped as a &quot;preset&quot; instrument on various synthesizers and keyboards beginning in the 1980s.
The General MIDI standard assigns the shakuhachi to program number 78. One of the best known pop songs of the 1980s that uses this sound is &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; by Peter Gabriel. This was also used in the ident of the short-lived Coca-Cola Telecommunications.

<doc id="188860" wikidata="Q2164400" url="?curid=188860" title="Vladimiro Montesinos">
<text>Vladimiro Lenin Ilich Montesinos Torres (; born May 20, 1945) is a Peruvian former intelligence officer and lawyer, most notorious for his role as the head of Peru&#x27;s National Intelligence Service (SIN) during the presidency of Alberto Fujimori. Montesinos was widely regarded as the power behind the throne, often regarded as the true authority in the government, supported by the Peruvian Armed Forces. 

Montesinos&#x27; career was marked by his deep connections with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), through which he received substantial funding ostensibly for anti-terrorism efforts. His tenure saw numerous human rights abuses and corruption scandals. The &quot;Vladi-videos,&quot; secretly recorded tapes showing Montesinos bribing officials, led to a national scandal in 2000. This exposure forced him to flee Peru and precipitated Fujimori&#x27;s resignation.

Investigations unveiled Montesinos&#x27; involvement in a wide range of illegal activities, including embezzlement, drug trafficking, and orchestrating extrajudicial killings. He was subsequently captured, tried, and convicted on multiple charges. Despite his imprisonment, Montesinos continued to influence Peruvian politics and sought to protect allies within the Fujimorist faction, including Keiko Fujimori.

Montesinos&#x27; early life was influenced by his communist parents and his cousin, a leader of the Shining Path guerrilla group. He received military training in the U.S. and Peru, later becoming involved in intelligence and political advisory roles. His legal career, following a brief imprisonment for espionage, was marred by fraudulent activities and associations with drug traffickers.
==Early years and education==
Vladimiro Montesinos was born in the city of Arequipa, the capital of the Arequipa Region in southern Peru. His parents were devout communists of Greek origin and named their son after Vladimir Lenin. Montesinos is a cousin of the incarcerated communist leader Óscar Ramírez Durand, a.k.a. &quot;Feliciano&quot;, the leader of the Shining Path. In 1965, Montesinos graduated as a military cadet at the U.S. Army&#x27;s School of the Americas in Panama. A year later, he graduated from the Chorrillos Military School, in Lima, Peru.

==Career==

=== Military career ===

==== Aide to prime ministers ====
In 1973, during the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru&#x27;s leftist military &quot;junta&quot; of General Juan Velasco Alvarado, Montesinos became an artillery captain in the Peruvian army and was appointed to the role of aide to General Edgardo Mercado Jarrín, who served as both Prime Minister and Chief of the Armed Forces. While working with Jarrín, Montesinos travelled with the prime minister to Algeria, Colombia, Cuba, France, Spain and Venezuela. While visiting Cuba, he stayed with Raúl Castro as a personal guest. The Armed Forces Movement of Portugal had also reportedly been in contact with Montesinos. He visited several foreign institutions as an official representative of the Peruvian army, also without authorization.

When the Velasco government fell in 1975, Montesinos was able to maintain his position in the military during the more conservative government of General Francisco Morales-Bermúdez. He would also serve as an aide for prime ministers Guillermo Arbulú Galliani and Jorge Fernández Maldonado Solari during the government of Francisco Morales Bermúdez. A talented writer, Montesinos wrote many of the speeches for ministers of the government and was a frequent contributor to newspapers. He was also reportedly writing various treatises regarding an invasion of Chile and granting Bolivia access to the Pacific Ocean.

====CIA contact====

In 1974, political scientist Alfred Stepan of Yale University recommended to the Embassy of the United States, Lima that Montesinos be given the International Visitor&#x27;s Leader Grant, describing him as the &quot;most theoretically sophisticated of young military officers in national security doctrine&quot; and that he had &quot;considerable leadership potential&quot;. Montesinos expressed during the nomination process that he wanted to meet with officials of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States National Security Council of President Gerald Ford to discuss military and economic relations. He also specified to US officials that he did not want to &quot;waste time&quot; going to tourist destinations such as Walt Disney World. The United States Department of State and the CIA then began its relationship with Montesinos.

From 5 to 21 September 1976, Montesinos travelled to Washington, D.C. paid for by the United States government, meeting with multiple US officials; Robert Hawkins of the CIA&#x27;s Office of Current Intelligence, Luigi R. Einaudi, policy-planning chief of the US State Department&#x27;s Latin America division, Alfred Stepan of Yale University, Albert Fishlow of University of California, Berkeley, Riordan Roett of Johns Hopkins University and Abraham Lowenthal of the University of Southern California were documented to have met with Montesinos. Such trips for foreign individuals provided by the United States were rare at the time and were only reserved for high-value recruits destined to carry out US interests.

Upon his return to Lima, he was arrested for having failed to obtain formal government permission to make the trip. In 1977, Major José Fernández Salvatteci of the Army Intelligence Service ( (SIE)) charged Montesinos with the crimes of spying and treason, accusing him of delivering military documents to the embassy of the United States in Lima. The documents included a list of weapons which Peru had purchased from the Soviet Union. The subsequent investigation revealed that top-secret documents had been found in his possession, and that he had photographed them and given copies to the CIA. Montesinos had travelled to the U.S. without authorization from army command, and had forged military documents to allow him to complete the trip without being detained.

Montesinos was dishonorably discharged from the military and sentenced two years in the military prison at Bolivar Barracks in Pueblo Libre. This was a far less severe sentence than the customary death penalty that was the punishment for traitors during the military regime. United States Ambassador to Peru Robert William Dean contacted Minister of Foreign Affairs of Peru José de la Puente Radbill to pressure for Montesinos&#x27; release while the attorney representing the imprisoned army captain was asked to contact Einaudi. General Mercado then ordered the charges be dropped.

Years later, declassified US State Department documents revealed the reason for the CIA&#x27;s interest in Montesinos. In the 1970s, Peru was governed by one of the few left-wing regimes in South America, a continent dominated by right-wing governments. Locked in the Cold War with the Soviet Union and fearing its influence in the region, as well as that of the Communist government of Cuba, the US was seeking information about activities in Peru. Montesinos conjured up and told a story about potential attacks against Peru&#x27;s southern rival, Chile, then ruled by dictator Augusto Pinochet, an ally of the U.S.

===Attorney career===
In February 1978, Montesinos was freed after two years in jail. He was given work by his cousin Sergio Cardenal Montesinos, a lawyer who persuaded him to pursue a degree in law. In April of the same year, Montesinos applied to the National University of San Marcos in Lima. He received his law diploma only three months later, through fraudulent means. Book No. 24 of the University of San Marcos Office of Records, where Montesinos&#x27; graduation would be noted, has disappeared from the Office. Montesinos&#x27; undergraduate thesis and other materials related to his academic record have never been produced.

On 15 August 1978, Montesinos used his degree to register as a lawyer with the Superior Court of Lima. Ten days later, on 25 August 1978, he became a member of the Lima bar association. He became notorious for representing a number of Colombian and Peruvian members of the illegal drug trade, as well as police officers accused of being involved in drug trafficking. Between 1978 and 1979, he represented Colombian drug lords Evaristo &quot;Papá Doc&quot; Porras Ardila and Jaime Tamayo. In addition, he acted as guarantor on Tamayo&#x27;s lease of several offices and warehouses used to manufacture cocaine.

Between 1980 and 1983, Montesinos revealed sensitive information related to military wiretapping and assassinations to the newspaper &quot;Kausachum&quot;, run by Augusto Zimmerman, ex-spokesperson of deposed president Juan Velasco Alvarado. General Carlos Briceño, the Commander of the Peruvian Army, re-opened the investigation into Montesinos&#x27; alleged treason. Montesinos fled to Ecuador, where in 1984 he revealed information to the Ecuadorian Army about Peru&#x27;s military weapons purchases. The investigation was closed that year in order to &quot;protect institutional image&quot;, and Montesinos was allowed to return to Peru.

==Leadership==
=== &quot;Plan Verde&quot; ===
During his attorney career, Montesinos was hired by Susana Higuchi, the wife of engineer Alberto Fujimori, assisting Higuchi after she made controversial deals in real estate. The paperwork in the case disappeared and the charges were dropped. This began the relationship between Montesinos and Fujimori.

Peruvian journalist Gustavo Gorriti reported that Montesinos allegedly used $1 million provided by Pablo Escobar to fund the presidential campaign for Fujimori in the 1990 Peruvian general election to enter as a dark horse candidate. In addition, evidence exists that Montesinos reportedly forged tax documents and the birth certificate of Fujimori according to the &quot;Harvard International Review&quot;. Prior to the election, the Peruvian Armed Forces created &quot;Plan Verde&quot;, a clandestine military operation developed during the internal conflict in Peru that involved the genocide of impoverished and indigenous Peruvians, the control or censorship of media in the nation and the establishment of a neoliberal economy controlled by a military junta in Peru. The military decided against committing a coup as initially outlined in &quot;Plan Verde&quot; as they expected Mario Vargas Llosa, a neoliberal candidate, to be elected in the 1990 election. According to Fernando Rospigliosi, Montesinos was not initially involved with &quot;Plan Verde&quot;, but his ability to resolve issues for the military resulted in the armed forces tasking him with implementing the plan with Fujimori, while Alfredo Schulte-Bockholt would say that both General Nicolás de Bari Hermoza and Montesinos were responsible for the relationship between the armed forces and Fujimori.

Peruvian political analyst Umberto Jara would describe the relationship Montesinos had between the military and Fujimori:

Mario Vargas Llosa later reported that United States Ambassador to Peru, Anthony C. E. Quainton, personally told him that allegedly leaked documents of the CIA purportedly being supportive of Fujimori&#x27;s candidacy were authentic. Rendón writes that the United States supported Fujimori because of his relationship with Montesinos.

Fujimori&#x27;s campaign exploited the popular distrust of the existing Peruvian political establishment and the uncertainty about the proposed neoliberal economic reforms of his opponent Vargas Llosa. Fujimori would win the election, and according to &quot;Oiga&quot;, the armed forces finalized plans on 18 June 1990 involving multiple scenarios for a coup to be executed on 27 July 1990, the day prior to Fujimori&#x27;s inauguration. The magazine noted that in one of the scenarios, titled &quot;Negotiation and agreement with Fujimori. Bases of negotiation: concept of directed Democracy and Market Economy&quot;, Fujimori was to be directed on accepting the military&#x27;s plan at least twenty-four hours before his inauguration. Rospigliosi writes that head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), General Edwin “Cucharita” Díaz, beside Montesinos also played a key role with making Fujimori abide by the military&#x27;s demands. Díaz and Montesinos allegedly convinced Fujimori that he was being targeted by the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and made Fujimori stay at the Círculo Militar, limiting his access to only military officials. Rospigliosi states &quot;an understanding was established between Fujimori, Montesinos and some of the military officers&quot; involved in &quot;Plan Verde&quot; prior to Fujimori&#x27;s inauguration. Montesinos and SIN officials would ultimately assume the armed force&#x27;s position in the plan, placing SIN operatives into military leadership roles.

After Fujimori won the presidential election on 28 July 1990, Montesinos became his chief advisor and the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the SIN. Fujimori would go on to adopt many of the policies outlined in Plan Verde. Just days after Fujimori took office, the United States shared concerns in diplomatic cables that paramilitary death squads had been created by Montesinos. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), according to documents, believed in 1990 that Montesinos effectively ruled Peru through the SIN. Former Peruvian generals and commanders also reported to the United States that Montesinos controlled Fujimori. Montesinos then reportedly made Fujimori nominate former artillery officers to head key sectors of civilian and military posts, including the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior, effectively giving Montesinos control of Peru&#x27;s military. In a statement to a colleague at the time, Montesinos would remark &quot;[Fujimori] is completely malleable: he does nothing at all without me knowing&quot;.

=== Relationship with the United States ===
While leading the SIN through the 1990s, Montesinos served the interests of the United States on multiple occasions according to the &quot;Harvard International Review&quot;. The United States reportedly support Fujimori&#x27;s candidacy in the 1990 elections due to Montesinos&#x27; ties. The United States reportedly maintained a relationship with Montesinos as a way to have direct influence in Peru; the SIN head would clear bureaucratic obstacles and would immediately implement the recommendations of the CIA. During his years with Fujimori, Montesinos was said to be paid $1 million annually by the CIA from 1990 to 2000, according to US officials, while the CIA and the DEA defended him from allegations of misconduct. In a 1998 letter from the CIA chief in Lima sent to Montesinos, the American official would admire Montesinos&#x27; &quot;leadership, dedication, and professionalism&quot;.

Montesinos had strong connections with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for over 25 years and was said to have received $10 million from the agency for his government&#x27;s anti-terrorist activities, with international bank accounts possessed by Montesinos reportedly holding at least $270 million.

Monstesinos was directly involved with assisting American businesses establish deals in Peru, mediating US-led drug enforcement efforts in the Peruvian army and air force and obtaining money for US antinarcotics missions in Peru upon demand. One of his largest accomplishments for the United States was granting majority mining rights of the Yanacocha mine – the fourth largest gold mine in the world – to the US-based Newmont. French mining company Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières discovered the Yanacocha, though Newmont sought majority rights to access the mine, raising a judicial dispute between the two. US Ambassador to Peru Dennis Jett told the Fujimori government that &quot;any appearance of succumbing to French pressure would feed rumors of corruption in the Peruvian judicial system and thus scare off international investors&quot;, with Montesinos later telling a supreme court judge tasked with decision that if the decision was not in favor with Newmont, then the United States would not support Peru&#x27;s territorial dispute with Ecuador from the Cenepa War. The Supreme Court ultimately decided 4-3 in favor of granting the rights to Newmont.

===Political repression===
The DEA documented in December 1990, that Montesinos utilized illegal surveillance acts both domestically and internationally.

Montesinos is widely accused of threatening or harassing Fujimori&#x27;s political opponents. Evidence proves that he supervised a death squad known as the Grupo Colina, part of the National Intelligence Service, which was thought to have been responsible for the Barrios Altos massacre and the La Cantuta massacre, actions intended to repress the Shining Path (&quot;Sendero Luminoso&quot;), the major communist insurgency movement that had been operating since the 1980s, but only resulted in the execution of civilians. Montesinos avoided large-scale violence against opponents, saying he wanted to avoid performing &quot;clumsy&quot; acts that occurred under Chilean president Augusto Pinochet. Violence instead targeted peasants and students, avoiding prominent individuals in order to remain covert.

Four officers who were tortured during interrogation after plotting a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against Fujimori in November 1992 later stated that Montesinos took an active part in torturing them. On 16 March 1998, former Peruvian Army Intelligence Agent Luisa Zanatta accused Montesinos of ordering illegal wiretaps of leading politicians and journalists. Zanatta also said that army intelligence agents had killed fellow agent Mariella Barreto Riofano because she gave a magazine information about human rights violations, as well as the location of bodies from the La Cantuta massacre. Zanatta said that in early 1997, Barreto had told her that she was part of the Grupo Colina death squad responsible for the La Cantuta massacre. Barreto&#x27;s dismembered body was found by a roadside on 29 March 1997, and showed evidence of torture before death and mutilation.

===Control of the media===
During the Fujimori years, Montesinos gained extensive control over the Peruvian media by bribing television channel executives in an effort to know and control all information within Peru. Bribes ranged from approximately US$500,000 per month to Channels 2 and 5 to $1.5 million per month to Channel 4. In total, Montesinos paid more than US$3 million per month in bribes to Peruvian television channels.

Montesinos funneled additional funds to the television channels through government advertising. From 1997 to 1999, the Peruvian government increased their advertising budget by 52%, becoming Peru&#x27;s largest advertiser. Ultimately, Montesinos held editorial control over Peru&#x27;s free-to-air television networks: Frecuencia Latina, América Televisión, Panamericana Televisión, ATV, and Red Global.

To maintain this control he structured bribe payments in monthly installments, limiting the risk of defection by the TV channel owners. He also ensured continued cooperation through blackmail, utilizing video evidence of sexual indiscretions by bribe recipients. To keep track of the numerous bribes and gain further evidence of the owners&#x27; complicity, which could also be used as blackmail, Montesinos filmed monetary exchanges and forced channel executives to sign contracts stipulating the extent of influence he expected in return for the stated monetary bribe.

The Fujimori government also controlled the content of Channel 7, Televisión Nacional de Peru, which was explicitly state owned. Canal N, remained the only independent television channel, funded entirely by monthly service fees. Montesinos did not bribe Canal N because of their low viewership, numbering in the tens of thousands, which was a result of the unaffordability of the monthly fees for most Peruvians. Canal N was the first network to air the Kouri videotape, which exposed the extent of Montesinos&#x27;s corruption.

On 14 July 1997, the government legally stripped Baruch Ivcher, a native Israeli, of his Peruvian nationality for supposed offenses against the government. In September, control of Channel 2 was given to minority shareholders more sympathetic to the government. In response, former United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar said, &quot;Peru is no longer a democracy. We are now a country headed by an authoritarian regime.&quot;

===2000 elections===

The 2000 presidential elections, which followed years of political violence, was controversial. A journalist claimed to have a videotape of Montesinos bribing election officials to fix the vote. He claimed to have been kidnapped by secret police agents, who sawed his arm to the bone to get him to give up the tape. In view of such tactics, the Clinton administration threatened briefly not to recognize Fujimori&#x27;s victory. It backed off from this threat, and pressured Fujimori&#x27;s government to take action to root out abuses, including ousting Montesinos.

Continuing political unrest in Peru would have represented a serious problem as US operations against the FARC in Colombia got under way. Peru was needed as a base of operations and a defensive backstop against guerrillas based in Colombia&#x27;s south, not far from the Peruvian border.

===Drug trafficking allegations===
The DEA was aware of reports in August 1990 that Montesinos was involved with being paid for the immunity of drug traffickers.

Allegations circulated that Montesinos and General Nicolás Hermoza Ríos, the chairman of Peru&#x27;s joint chiefs of staff, were taking protection money from drug traffickers. Documents that were later declassified by the US government showed that by 1996 the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was aware of the allegations. Despite evidence that Montesinos was in business with Colombian narco-traffickers, the CIA paid Montesinos&#x27;s intelligence organization $1 million a year for 10 years to fight drug trafficking.

One of the most notorious scandals during this period was the 11 May 1996 seizure of 169–176 kg of cocaine (the quantity depends on the source) aboard a Peruvian Air Force Douglas DC-8 (frequently confused in the media as the presidential Boeing 737 as it had operated on this role until the acquisition of the Boeing) that was about to depart on a mission to Russia (with stopovers at the Canary Islands and Bordeaux), carrying military aviation equipment for maintenance. The scandal remains a mystery to this day because the drug&#x27;s origin and destiny were never determined and the investigations were compromised by Fujimori&#x27;s corrupt government and possibly Montesinos himself. A 2011 investigation revealed that some four drug shipments were made abroad, with Miami listed as a destination, in air force planes during 1993–1994. Only the material authors (several low-ranking officers) were processed, acquitted and publicly defended by Fujimori in late 1997 (amongst them Fujimori&#x27;s aide-de-camp who was part of the plane&#x27;s crew).

Peruvian drug kingpin Demetrio Chávez Peñaherrera, known as &quot;El Vaticano&quot;, testified that Montesinos was a protector of drug trafficking. During a trial audience on 16 August 1996, Chávez Peñaherrera stated that he had bribed members of the Peruvian Armed Forces and Montesinos himself, as the effective chief of the Peruvian Intelligence Service (SIN), to be able to operate freely in Campanilla, a jungle area of the Huallaga region (where he operated an illegal airstrip). Recordings of radio communications presented during the trial showed that members of the army had let Chávez&#x27;s organization operate freely in the Huallaga region in exchange for bribes. During a latter appearance in the court, Chávez appeared tortured and drugged, evidenced by his incoherent speaking. After sentencing, while in prison, Chávez talked to the press and revealed that Montesinos said to him at one point that he &quot;did some work&quot; with Pablo Escobar, leader of the Medellín Cartel.

Montesinos was paid US$50,000 a month during 1991 and 1992. As proof, the government presented recordings during Chávez&#x27;s trial of radio communications between his drug traffickers and members of the Armed Forces attesting to bribery of Montesinos. In addition, Chávez said that retired general Nicolás de Bari Hermoza, the former chief of the Armed Forces Joint Command, and Fujimori had both complete knowledge of the illicit acts of Montesinos.

==Downfall==
Frequently, Montesinos secretly videotaped himself bribing individuals in his office, incriminating politicians, officials and military officers. His downfall appears to have been precipitated by the discovery of a major illegal arms shipment. Arranged by guerrilla leader Tomás Medina Caracas, the arms were airlifted from Jordan via Peru, to the FARC insurgent guerrillas in southern Colombia.

Montesinos claimed the credit for uncovering the arms smuggling, which involved upwards of 10,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles. Jordan rejected the Peruvian version of events, insisting the shipments were legitimate government-to-government deals. Evidence emerged which pointed to Montesinos having orchestrated the gun-running operation rather than dismantling it. A senior Peruvian general was found to have participated in the deal, and another principal participant was a government contractor. He had signed at least eleven deals with the Fujimori regime, most of them to provide supplies to the Peruvian military.

According to one report, a group of military officers angered by Montesinos&#x27;s apparent role in the arms deal broke into his offices and stole the video that was subsequently broadcast. Because of the arms deal, Montesinos lost the support of the US, which attached high strategic importance to crushing the FARC.

===&quot;Vladi-videos&quot;===
On 14 September 2000, Peruvian television broadcast a video of Montesinos bribing an opposition congressman, Alberto Kouri, to support &quot;Perú 2000&quot;, Fujimori&#x27;s party. The video caused Fujimori&#x27;s remaining support to collapse. He accepted the resignation of Montesinos and thanked him for his services. He then announced the dissolution of the National Intelligence Service (SIN) and new elections, in which he would not run. Shortly thereafter, Montesinos sought political asylum in Panama.

In following months, some of the most infamous &quot;Vladi-videos&quot; were released. One showed the owners of Channel 2 being offered US$500,000 a month to ban appearances of the political opposition on their channel. Another showed Channel 4 owners getting $1.5 million a month for similar cooperation. Others show Montesinos counting out $350,000 in cash to Channel 5&#x27;s proprietor, and the owner of Channel 9 receiving $50,000 to cancel an investigative series called &quot;SIN censura&quot; (Uncensored). In June 2001, through the assistance of the U.S. Government, Montesinos was turned over to the Venezuelan government in Caracas and extradited back to Peru. Then his trial began.

==Trial==
Montesinos was convicted of embezzlement, illegal assumption of his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, influence peddling and bribery. Those charges carried sentences of between five and fifteen years each, but Peruvian prison sentences are served concurrently, so prosecutors continued to pursue him on additional charges. He was acquitted of two specific charges of corruption and conspiracy related to the mayor of Callao, whom he was alleged to have helped evade drug-trafficking charges. Montesinos was imprisoned at the Centro de Reclusión de Máxima Seguridad (CEREC) in Callao (which was built under his orders during the 1990s) and is serving 15 years in prison, but he will have to face at least 8 more trials in the next years. In total he was accused of sixty-three crimes that range from drug trafficking to murder.

On 29 January 2024, Montesinos pleaded guilty to charges of homicide, murder and forced disappearance in the 1992 killings of six farmers accused of being rebels in Pativilca, Lima Region, and was sentenced to 19 years&#x27; imprisonment.

== Imprisonment ==
In August 2004, U.S. officials returned to Peru $20 million in funds embezzled by Montesinos; it had been deposited in U.S. banks by two men working for him. Prime Minister Carlos Ferrero and other prosecutors believed that the total amount embezzled by Montesinos during his tenure at the National Intelligence Service surpassed one billion dollars, most of which was deposited in foreign banks.

In October 2004 Wilmer Yarleque Ordinola, 44, was apprehended in Virginia in the US and convicted of immigration fraud. He had been working as a construction laborer without papers. The Peruvian government sought his extradition as an alleged member of Montesino&#x27;s &quot;Grupo Colina&quot; and responsible for 26-35 deaths or &quot;disappearances&quot; which the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru) attributed to him. In October 2004 Yarleque was being held by the U.S. Marshals in Alexandria, Virginia. The suspect was initially granted a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, as he argued that he could not be extradited for political offenses committed for the government, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed that decision in 2005, opening the way for his extradition.

Montesinos was sentenced in September 2006 to a 20-year prison term for his direct involvement in an illegal arms deal to provide 10,000 assault weapons to Colombian rebels. Tribunal judges made their ruling based on evidence that placed Montesinos at the center of an intricate web of negotiations designed to transport assault rifles from Jordan to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC.

In 2007 Montesinos was on trial for allegedly ordering the extra-judicial killings of the hostage-takers from the left-wing Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) during the 1997 Japanese embassy hostage crisis. The former chief of the armed forces, , and retired Colonel Roberto Huaman were also charged with ordering the extrajudicial execution of the 14 rebels. This action followed the government&#x27;s commando raid in April to free the more than 70 diplomats who had been held hostage for more than four months in the Japanese embassy. The Peruvian special forces&#x27; recapture resulted in the deaths of one hostage, two commandos and all of the MRTA rebels. The former Japanese political attaché Hidetaka Ogura, one of the hostages freed from the Embassy, stated that he saw at least three of the MRTA rebels captured alive. Montesinos, Hermoza and Huaman were acquitted of those charges in 2012, as the court found that a chain of command linking the accused to the killings had not been proven.

In August 2012 Montesinos and the former chief of the Peruvian Air Force, Waldo Richter, were acquitted of drug trafficking for the 1996 Air Force plane case. He had been involved by a number of drug traffickers.

=== &quot;Vladi-audios&quot; ===
Following the 2021 Peruvian general election, audio recordings deemed &quot;Vladi-audios&quot; were leaked revealing that Montesinos was allegedly involved in at least 17 landline phone calls while imprisoned at the CEREC maximum security prison in an effort to prevent leftist presidential candidate Pedro Castillo from entering office and to protect Keiko Fujimori from being imprisoned. In one reported audio, Montesinos mentions a first plan to have Fujimori&#x27;s husband to go to the United States embassy in Lima to present &quot;documentation of the fraud&quot; to the Office of Regional Affairs and Central Intelligence Agency, with Montesinos allegedly saying he already contacted the embassy, that the documents would reach President Joe Biden and that his administration would condemn the election as interference from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, subsequently giving Fujimori&#x27;s claims of fraud more weight. In other reported audios, Montesinos suggests to retired military officer and Popular Force member Pedro Rejas Tataje on 10 June 2021 that they should bribe three electoral magistrates of the National Jury of Elections (JNE) – who were tasked with reviewing the narrow and controversial election – with one million dollars each, telling the former officer to contact attorney Guillermo Sendón who then reportedly made contact with JNE magistrate Luis Arce. The next day on 11 June, the JNE extended the deadline to file complaints to annul the election despite the maximum deadline already passing. Following the leak of the audios, Pedro Rejas Tataje released additional recording saying that he collected them as he believed that Montesinos was participating in illegal activities. Rejas would later explain that he believed Montesinos was directly involved with the campaign of Keiko Fujimori.

Right-wing politicians in Peru downplayed the audios of Montesinos. According to IDL-Reporteros, the Navy of Peru was involved in a &quot;lie&quot; when issuing their joint statement, saying that Montesinos was only involved in two phone calls, with IDL asking &quot;How could you not notice the 17 calls and 12 conversations at CEREC, at the Naval Base of the institution with the greatest development in electronic intelligence within the Armed Forces?&quot;. The Ministry of Defense opened an investigation of the matter and on 25 August 2021, President Pedro Castillo announced that Montesinos had been transferred to the Ancon II prison to serve the remaining of his sentence while four officers were replaced at the naval prison.

== In popular culture ==
Montesinos was portrayed in the Peruvian film &quot;Caiga quien caiga&quot;.
Montesinos plays a significant part in Mario Vargas Llosa&#x27;s novel Cinco Esquinas (The Neighborhood).

<text>Samuel Clarke (11 October 1675 – 17 May 1729) was an English philosopher and Anglican cleric. He is considered the major British figure in philosophy between John Locke and George Berkeley. Clarke&#x27;s altered, Nontrinitarian revision of the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; continues to influence worship among modern Unitarians.

==Early life and studies==
Clarke was born in Norwich, the son of Edward Clarke, an alderman of Norwich and Member of Parliament, and brother of John Clarke. He was educated at Norwich School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. His tutor at Caius was John Ellis, a personal friend of Isaac Newton, but who in natural philosophy taught in line with the Cartesianism that prevailed in the university.

Clarke, however, came to adopt the new physical system of Newton; he used the vehicle of an annotated translation of a work on physics in the Cartesian tradition to comment on the superiority of the Newtonian system. This textbook was published in 1697, and in the same year Clarke met the Newtonian William Whiston. It was a chance encounter in Norwich, but Whiston was then chaplain to John Moore, bishop of Norwich. Having taken holy orders, Clarke became chaplain to Moore in Whiston&#x27;s place, and was presented by Moore to the rectory of Drayton, Norfolk.

In 1706, through the influence of Moore, Clarke obtained the rectory of St Benet Paul&#x27;s Wharf, London. Soon afterwards Queen Anne appointed him one of her chaplains in ordinary, and in 1709 presented him to the rectory of St James&#x27;s, Westminster. His church brought Clarke into personal contact with Newton.

==Boyle Lectures (1704)==
Clarke was Boyle lecturer for two years, and produced two books. The Newtonian theologians used the Boyle Lectures to attack opponents (Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza, deists and freethinkers in particular). Clarke&#x27;s lectures set the agenda for further debates. He dealt in 1704 with the &quot;Being and Attributes of God&quot;, an example of a physico-theological system; and in 1705 with the &quot;Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion&quot;. These books were later published together.

Clarke&#x27;s reputation rested largely on his effort to demonstrate the existence of God, and his theory of the foundation of rectitude. The former is not a purely &quot;a priori&quot; argument, and it was not presented as such. The intelligence, for example, of the self-existence and original cause of all things is, he says, &quot;not easily proved &quot;a priori&quot;,&quot; but &quot;demonstrably proved &quot;a posteriori&quot; from the variety and degrees of perfection in things, and the order of causes and effects, from the intelligence that created beings are confessedly endowed with, and from the beauty, order, and final purpose of things.&quot; The theses maintained in the argument are:

#That something has existed from eternity
#that there has existed from eternity some one immutable and independent being
#that that immutable and independent being, which has existed from eternity, without any external cause of its existence, must be self-existent, that is, necessarily existing
#what the substance or essence of that being is, which is self-existent or necessarily existing, we have no idea, neither is it at all possible for us to comprehend it
#that though the substance or essence of the self-existent being is itself absolutely incomprehensible to us, yet many of the essential attributes of his nature are strictly demonstrable as well as his existence, and, in the first place, that he must be of necessity eternal
#that the self-existent being must of necessity be infinite and omnipresent
#must be but one
#must be an intelligent being
#must be not a necessary agent, but a being endued with liberty and choice
#must of necessity have infinite power
#must be infinitely wise, and
#must of necessity be a being of infinite goodness, justice, and truth, and all other moral perfections, such as become the supreme governor and judge of the world.

In order to establish his sixth thesis, Clarke contended that time and space, eternity and immensity, are not substances, but attributes: the attributes of a self-existent being.
The work of Clarke on the existence of God set off a British debate that lasted to the middle of the century. Edmund Law and other writers represented Clarke as arguing from the existence of time and space to the existence of Deity. Law was influenced by a 1718 work of Samuel Colliber that modified Clarke&#x27;s approach.

==Correspondence with Anthony Collins==
The public correspondence of Samuel Clarke with the English freethinker Anthony Collins in 1707 and 1708 was a debate on the nature of consciousness. The principal focus of the correspondence was the possibility of a materialist theory of mind. Collins defended the materialist position that consciousness was an emergent property of the brain, while Clarke opposed such a view and argued that mind and consciousness must be distinct from matter. The correspondence also inquired into the origins of consciousness, personal identity, free will, and determinism.

The debate arose from a controversy of 1706 on the immortality of the soul. Clarke published a refutation of the views of Henry Dodwell, and this drew in Collins, who wrote a &quot;Letter to Mr Dodwell&quot; in his defence. By the sixth edition (1731), Clarke&#x27;s own &quot;Letter to Mr Dodwell&quot; of 1706 had grown to 475 pages, including the replies of Collins. Clarke&#x27;s main argument against Dodwell was that the soul, being immaterial, must be immortal. John Norris argued differently, though on Clarke&#x27;s side of the debate, using in particular the ideas of Malebranche. Collins challenged Clarke on the ground of his substance dualism.

==Nontrinitarianism==
===&quot;The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity&quot; (1712)===
Clarke studied scripture in the original languages, and the primitive Christian writers. He took the degree of doctor in divinity in 1710, defending as his thesis the two propositions: &quot;Nullum fidei Christianae dogma, in Sacris Scripturis traditum, est rectae rationi dissentaneum&quot; [No doctrine of the Christian faith, delivered in the Holy Scriptures, is contrary to right reason.], and &quot;Sine actionum humanarum libertate nulla potest esse religio&quot; [Without the freedom of human actions, there can be no religion.]. The formal disputation was long remembered for Clarke&#x27;s virtuosity; but the presiding Regius Professor, Henry James, received the distinct impression that Clarke&#x27;s views on the Trinity were unorthodox. Clarke was required to swear to keep the 39 Articles; and his attempt at self-justification by putting his views in book form were not immediately successful.

During 1712 Clarke published his treatise on &quot;The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity&quot;. It is divided into three parts. The first contains a collection and exegesis of texts in the New Testament relating to the doctrine of the Trinity; in the second the doctrine is set out, and explained as a set of propositions; and in the third passages in the liturgy of the Church of England relating to the doctrine of the Trinity are considered.

Whiston claimed that, some time before publication, a message was sent to Clarke by Sidney Godolphin, to the effect &quot;the affairs of the public were with difficulty then kept in the hands of those that were for liberty&quot;, and that therefore it was a bad time for the publication of a controversial book. Clarke in any case took no notice of any Whig qualms.

Maurice Wiles calls Clarke&#x27;s views &quot;moderate Arianism&quot;. At the time they were certainly denounced as Arianism; they belonged, as did Newton&#x27;s, to the type of antitrinitarianism later called &quot;High Arianism&quot;. Clarke&#x27;s position was subordinationist, and less radical than Newton&#x27;s and typical English Unitarians of his time. He looked at 1251 biblical texts, and rejected the added phrase known as the Johannine Comma. He made a more careful case than Whiston.

===The Trinitarian controversy===
The controversy within the Church of England to which Clarke was a major contributor had been initiated by George Bull, with his publication in 1685 of views on the opinions of the Church Fathers before the First Council of Nicaea (325 AD). He was reacting to issues that had been raised elsewhere in Europe, by Petavius, by Christopher Sandius and Daniel Zwicker for the Socinian camp, and the Arminians.

It was only with the close discussions of Clarke and his major opponent Daniel Waterland, a generation later, that the theological and historical points involved came clearly into focus. Clarke and Waterland had definite differences on the theology of consubstantiality and aseity.

Waterland argued in theology for the Anglican orthodoxy of time, in particular that the possible attitudes were, besides the orthodox Athanasian view, limited to Arianism and Sabellianism; and that the two latter were not consistent with Scripture. He also championed Bull&#x27;s historical claim, that the Fathers before Nicaea held the views that were orthodox after Nicaea. Clarke&#x27;s resistance to both points has had support from some modern scholars.

The trajectory of the English controversy from 1712 involved at least ten writers. By summer 1714 the debate on &quot;The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity&quot; had ramified, and provoked a formal complaint from the Lower House of Convocation: the Blasphemy Act 1697 still made it an offence for &quot;any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the Holy Trinity&quot;. Clarke drew up an apologetic preface, and then gave explanations which satisfied the Upper House of Convocation. He had strong supporters among the bishops. Clarke promised not to preach or write on the topic. Arthur Ashley Sykes and John Jackson from then on acted as his proxies. Other main participants in the controversy were John Edwards, Francis Gastrell, James Knight who published with Bull&#x27;s biographer Robert Nelson, Richard Mayo of Great Kimble (son of the nonconformist Richard Mayo), Stephen Nye, Edward Welchman and Edward Wells.

Caroline of Ansbach, the Princess of Wales, requested that Clarke defend his views in a disputation with Edward Hawarden, and it took place in 1719, in her presence. Hawarden returned to the subject in &quot;Answer to Dr. Clarke and Mr. Whiston&quot; (1729).

===Revised prayer book===

By 1724, Clarke had been pressured to public retract his Nontrinitarian views. However, he maintained these beliefs in private. That year, Clarke privately altered his copy of the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, deleting Trinitarian formulae and the Athanasian Creed. The work went unpublished, though copies were made and his son later donated the original manuscript to the British Library. Theophilus Lindsey eventually encountered a copy in the possession of John Disney. Lindsey, using Clarke&#x27;s work as his basis, published his own Unitarian prayer book revision in 1774 and began using it with his Essex Street Chapel congregation. In 1785, Lindsey&#x27;s work was further adapted by James Freeman for use at King&#x27;s Chapel in Boston, where a ninth edition version is still used.

==Correspondence with Leibniz==

In 1715 and 1716 Clarke had a discussion with Gottfried Leibniz on the principles of natural philosophy and religion, which was cut short when Leibniz died. A collection of the papers which passed between them was published in 1717.

==Later life and death==
In 1719 Clarke was presented by Nicholas Lechmere, 1st Baron Lechmere, to the mastership of Wigston&#x27;s hospital in Leicester. In 1727, on the death of Sir Isaac Newton, he was offered by the court the post of Master of the Mint, worth on an average from £1200 to £1500 a year. He refused the position.

On Sunday 11 May 1729, when going out to preach before the judges at Serjeants&#x27; Inn, Clarke had a sudden illness. It caused his death on the Saturday following, in London. His funeral was held at St James&#x27;s on Thursday, 22 May.

==Works==
===Translations===
Clarke published a Latin version of the &quot;Traité de physique&quot; of Jacques Rohault (1617(?)-1672) with notes, which he finished before he was twenty-two. The system of Rohault was based on Cartesian principles, and was previously known only through the medium of a crude Latin version. Clarke&#x27;s translation (1697) continued to be used as a text-book in the university till supplanted by the treatises of Newton. Four editions were issued, the last being that of 1718. It was translated into English in 1723 by his younger brother John, dean of Salisbury.

In 1706 Clarke translated Newton&#x27;s &quot;Opticks&quot; into Latin, for which the author presented him with £500. In 1709, at the request of the author, Clarke revised William Whiston&#x27;s English translation of the &quot;Apostolical Constitutions&quot;. In 1712 he published an annotated edition of &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Commentaries&quot;, with engravings, dedicated to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.

In 1729 he published the first twelve books of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. This edition, dedicated to William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, was praised by Bishop Hoadly. Three years after his death appeared also the last twelve books of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, published by his son Samuel Clarke, the first three of these books and part of the fourth having, as he states, been revised and annotated by his father.

===Other works===
In 1699 Clarke published two treatises: &quot;Three Practical Essays on Baptism, Confirmation and Repentance&quot; and &quot;Some Reflections on that part of a book called Amyntor, or a Defence of Milton&#x27;s Life, which relates to the Writings of the Primitive Fathers, and the Canon of the New Testament&quot;. In 1701 he published &quot;A Paraphrase upon the Gospel of St Matthew&quot;, which was followed, in 1702, by the &quot;Paraphrases upon the Gospels of St Mark and St Luke&quot;, and soon afterwards by a third volume upon St John. They were subsequently printed together in two volumes and passed through several editions.

In 1724 Clarke published seventeen sermons, eleven of which had not before been printed. In 1728 was published &quot;A Letter from Dr Clarke to Benjamin Hoadly, F.R.S., occasioned by the controversy relating to the Proportion of Velocity and Force in Bodies in Motion,&quot; printed in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;.

Soon after his death his brother, Dr John Clarke, published, from his original manuscripts, &quot;An Exposition of the Church Catechism&quot;, and ten volumes of sermons. The &quot;Exposition&quot; is composed of the lectures which he read on Thursday mornings, for some months in the year, at St James&#x27;s church. He revised them, and left them ready for the press.

==Moral views==
Clarke&#x27;s ethical theory of &quot;fitness&quot; is formulated on the analogy of mathematics. He held that in relation to the will things possess an objective fitness similar to the mutual consistency of things in the physical universe. This fitness God has given to actions, as he has given laws to Nature; and the fitness is as immutable as the laws. The theory was criticized by Théodore Simon Jouffroy, Amédée Jacques, Sir James Mackintosh, Thomas Brown, Francis Hutcheson, and others, but substantially defended by John Balguy against Hutcheson&#x27;s sentimentalist case against moral rationalism. A similar form of moral rationalism is developed by the Cambridge Platonist Ralph Cudworth.

==Influence==
Clarke had an influence on Enlightenment philosophers including Lord Monboddo. He left notes on the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. These became the source of Theophilus Lindsey&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Common Prayer Reformed According to the Plan of the Late Dr. Samuel Clarke&quot; 1774, and other liturgical works.

==Family==
Clarke married his first cousin Katherine Lockwood ( 1753), daughter of the Rev. Mr. Lockwood of Little Massingham, Norfolk and Katherine Clarke in St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Burnham Norton, Norfolk on 17 October 1700. They had seven children, of whom five survived him; only three children are mentioned in their mother&#x27;s will, Samuel, Dorothy and Katherine. Clarke&#x27;s surviving son Samuel Clarke ( 1710) died without issue sometime in 1778. His will was proved by his cousin Frances Clarke, one of the daughters of his uncle John Clarke on 13 May 1778.

<doc id="188863" wikidata="Q48634" url="?curid=188863" title="Sarcophagus">
<text>A sarcophagus (: sarcophagi or sarcophaguses) is a coffin, most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word &quot;sarcophagus&quot; comes from the Greek &#x27; meaning &quot;flesh&quot;, and&#x27; meaning &quot;to eat&quot;; hence &quot;sarcophagus&quot; means &quot;flesh-eating&quot;, from the phrase &quot;lithos sarkophagos&quot; ( ), &quot;flesh-eating stone&quot;. The word also came to refer to a particular kind of limestone that was thought to rapidly facilitate the decomposition of the flesh of corpses contained within it due to the chemical properties of the limestone itself.

== History of the sarcophagus ==
Sarcophagi were most often designed to remain above ground. The earliest stone sarcophagi were used by Egyptian pharaohs of the 3rd dynasty, which reigned from about 2686 to 2613 BC.

The Hagia Triada sarcophagus is a stone sarcophagus elaborately painted in fresco; one style of later Ancient Greek sarcophagus in painted pottery is seen in Klazomenian sarcophagi, produced around the Ionian Greek city of Klazomenai, where most examples were found, between 550 BC (Late Archaic) and 470 BC. They are made of coarse clay in shades of brown to pink. Added to the basin-like main sarcophagus is a broad, rectangular frame, often covered with a white slip and then painted. The huge Lycian Tomb of Payava, now in the British Museum, is a royal tomb monument of about 360 BC designed for an open-air placing, a grand example of a common Lycian style.

Ancient Roman sarcophagi—sometimes metal or plaster as well as limestone—were popular from about the reign of Trajan, and often elaborately carved, until the early Christian burial preference for interment underground, often in a limestone sepulchre, led to their falling out of favor. However, there are many important Early Christian sarcophagi from the 3rd to 4th centuries. Most Roman examples were designed to be placed against a wall and are decorated on three sides only. Sarcophagi continued to be used in Christian Europe for important figures, especially rulers and leading church figures, and by the High Middle Ages often had a recumbent tomb effigy lying on the lid. More plain sarcophagi were placed in crypts. The most famous examples include the Habsburg Imperial Crypt in Vienna, Austria. The term tends to be less often used to describe Medieval, Renaissance, and later examples.

In the early modern period, lack of space tended to make sarcophagi impractical in churches, but chest tombs or false sarcophagi, empty and usually bottomless cases placed over an underground burial, became popular in outside locations such as cemeteries and churchyards, especially in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, where memorials were mostly not highly decorated and the extra cost of a false sarcophagus over a headstone acted as an indication of social status.

==United States==

Sarcophagi, usually &quot;false&quot;, made a return to the cemeteries of America during the last quarter of the 19th century, at which time, according to a New York company which built sarcophagi, &quot;it was decidedly the most prevalent of all memorials in our cemeteries&quot;. They continued to be popular into the 1950s, at which time the popularity of flat memorials (making for easier grounds maintenance) made them obsolete. Nonetheless, a 1952 catalog from the memorial industry still included eight pages of them, broken down into Georgian and Classical detail, a Gothic and Renaissance adaptation, and a Modern variant. The image shows sarcophagi from the late 19th century located in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The one in the back, the Warner Monument created by Alexander Milne Calder (1879), features the spirit or soul of the deceased being released.

==Asia==
In the Mekong Delta in southwestern Vietnam, it is common for families to inter their members in sarcophagi near their homes, thus allowing ready access for visits as a part of the indigenous tradition of ancestor worship.

In Sulawesi, Indonesia, waruga are a traditional form of sarcophagus.

==India==
Nearly 140 years after British archaeologist Alexander Rea unearthed a sarcophagus from the hillocks of Pallavaram in Tamil Nadu, an identical artifact dating back by more than 2,000 years has been discovered in the same locality.

==Spain==
Phoenician and Paleochristian sarcophagi have been found in the Iberian Peninsula.

<doc id="188864" wikidata="Q4328" url="?curid=188864" title="Alberic of Reims">
<text>Alberic of Reims ( 1085 – 1141) was a scholar who studied under Anselm of Laon and later became an opponent of Peter Abelard. 

He was originally from Reims, but moved to nearby Laon to study under Anselm and his brother Ralph. When Anselm died he returned to his hometown to take a position at the School of Reims, restoring that school to its earlier prominence. He also served as Archdeacon of Reims from 1131 to 1136. He was reluctantly promoted by the Pope to be Archbishop of Bourges in 1136 and served there until his death in 1141. Other than a single letter, no writings of Alberic survive. He was considered one of the great scholars of his age by his contemporaries. His specialty, building on the work of Anslem, was commentaries on the Christian Bible.

Alberic along with another student of Anselm&#x27;s, Lotulf of Lombardy, instigated proceedings against Peter Abelard, charging him with the heresy of Sabellius in a provincial synod held at Soissons in 1121. Alberic was a follower of the longstanding approach of judging theological arguments by the historical authority or who had made them. This view was rapidly undermined by Abelard&#x27;s dialectical approach that came to dominate.

<doc id="188870" wikidata="Q6214" url="?curid=188870" title="Recklinghausen (district)">
<text>Recklinghausen () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the centre of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is surrounded by the neighbouring districts of Borken, Coesfeld, Unna, Gelsenkirchen, Bottrop, and Wesel. The district administration is located in the city of the same name.

Apart from the Region Hannover, Kreis Recklinghausen is the largest non-city district in Germany by population.

==History==
During medieval times, the area surrounding present-day Recklinghausen was known as &quot;Vest&quot; Recklinghausen, a territory which belonged to the Electorate of Cologne. From 1446 to 1576, this area was leased to the lordship of Gemen (now a part of the city Borken) and Schaumburg-Lippe. In 1811, the territory was added to the Grand Duchy of Berg, and in 1815 it became part of the Prussian Province of Westphalia.

The district was created in 1816. After several changes it obtained its present borders with the last reorganizations of 1975–76. It is also one of the oldest districts located in Germany.

==Geography==
The district Recklinghausen is located at the north of the Ruhr area with the urban parts of Ruhr area to the south and the rural &quot;Münsterland&quot; to the north. The Lippe River flows through the district.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show a silver nettle leaf on green ground - the sign of the &quot;Herrlichkeit Lembeck&quot;, an &quot;Amt&quot; (subdivision) in the clerical state of Münster. The black cross is the sign of the Bishops of Cologne who owned a big part of the district&#x27;s area, the &quot;Vest&quot; Recklinghausen. The key inside the cross symbolizes St. Peter, the patron of Cologne.

<text>A bachelor&#x27;s degree (from Medieval Latin &quot;baccalaureus&quot;) or baccalaureate (from Modern Latin &quot;baccalaureatus&quot;) is an undergraduate degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to six years (depending on the institution and academic discipline). The two most common bachelor&#x27;s degrees are the Bachelor of Arts (BA) and the Bachelor of Science (BS or BSc). In some institutions and educational systems, certain bachelor&#x27;s degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate educations after a first degree has been completed, although more commonly the successful completion of a bachelor&#x27;s degree is a prerequisite for further courses such as a master&#x27;s or a doctorate.

In countries with qualifications frameworks, bachelor&#x27;s degrees are normally one of the major levels in the framework (sometimes two levels where non-honours and honours bachelor&#x27;s degrees are considered separately). However, some qualifications titled bachelor&#x27;s degree may be at other levels (e.g., MBBS) and some qualifications with non-bachelor&#x27;s titles may be classified as bachelor&#x27;s degrees (e.g. the Scottish MA and Canadian MD).

The term &quot;bachelor&quot; in the 12th century referred to a knight bachelor, who was too young or poor to gather vassals under his own banner. By the end of the 13th century, it was also used by junior members of guilds or universities. By folk etymology or wordplay, the word &quot;baccalaureus&quot; came to be associated with &quot;bacca lauri&quot; (&quot;laurel berry&quot;); this is in reference to laurels being awarded for academic success or honours.

Under the British system, and those influenced by it, undergraduate academic degrees are differentiated between &quot;honours degrees&quot; (sometimes denoted by the addition of &quot;(Hons)&quot; after the degree abbreviation) and non-honours degrees (known variously as &quot;pass degrees&quot;, &quot;ordinary degrees&quot; or &quot;general degrees&quot;). An honours degree generally requires a higher academic standard than a pass degree, and in some systems an additional year of study beyond the non-honours bachelor&#x27;s. Some countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada, have a postgraduate &quot;bachelor with honours&quot; degree. This may be taken as a consecutive academic degree, continuing on from the completion of a bachelor&#x27;s degree program in the same field, or as part of an integrated honours program. Programs like these typically require completion of a full year-long research thesis project.

==Scheme of completion periods in each country==
The map shows how long it takes for students in different countries to get a bachelor&#x27;s degree. It generally takes between 3 and 6 years.

==Variations==
===Africa===
In most African countries, the university systems follow the model of their former colonizing power. For example, the Nigerian university system is similar to the British system, while the Ivorian system is akin to the French.

====Algeria====
Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Algerian universities are called &quot;&quot; in Arabic or &#x27; in French; the degree normally takes three years to complete and is a part of the LMD (&quot;licence&quot;, &quot;master&quot;, &quot;doctorat&quot;) reform, students can enroll in a bachelor&#x27;s degree program in different fields of study after having obtained their &#x27; (the national secondary education test). The degree is typically identical to the program of France&#x27;s universities, as specified in the LMD reform. Bachelor&#x27;s degree programs cover most of the fields in Algerian universities, except some fields, such as Medicine and Pharmaceutical Science.

====Botswana====
Bachelor&#x27;s degrees at the University of Botswana normally take four years. The system draws on both British and American models. Degrees are classified as First Class, Second Class Division One (2:1), Second Class Division Two (2:2) and Third as in English degrees, but without being described as honours. The main degrees are named by British tradition (Arts, Science, Law, etc.); in recent years, however, there have been a number of degrees named after specific subjects, such as Bachelor of Library and Information.

====Kenya====
In Kenya, university education is supported by the government. A bachelor&#x27;s degree is awarded to students who successfully complete a three to seven-year course depending on the area of study. For most degree programs, a research project and an internship period after which a report is written by the student is a must before the student is allowed to graduate. In 2012, a number of select colleges were upgraded to university status in a bid to increase the intake of students into degree programs.

====Morocco====
In Morocco, a bachelor&#x27;s degree is referred to as &quot;al-ʾijāzah&quot; (Arabic, French: &#x27;). The course of study takes three years, which are further divided into two cycles. The first cycle comprises the first, or propaedeutic, year. After successfully completing their first two years, students can pursue either theoretical specialization (&#x27;) or professional specialization (&#x27;). The second cycle is one year after whose completion students receive the &#x27; or the &quot;l&quot;.
This academic degree system was introduced in September 2003.

====Nigeria====
University admission is extremely competitive, with attendant advantages and disadvantages. Nonetheless, it takes four to five years to complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree. In cases of poor performance, the time limit is double the standard amount of time. For example, one may not study for more than 10 years for a five-year course. Students are normally asked to leave if they must take longer. Nigerian universities offer BSc, BTech (usually from Universities of Technology), BArch (six years), and other specialized undergraduate degrees, such as BEng. Science undergraduate degrees may require six months or a semester dedicated to SIWES (Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme) but it is usually mandatory for all engineering degrees. A semester for project work/thesis is required, not excluding course work, during the bachelor thesis in the final year. The classifications of degrees: first-class, second-class (upper and lower), third-class (with honours; i.e., BSc (Hons)) and a pass (no honours). First- and second-class graduates are immediately eligible for advanced postgraduate degrees (i.e., MSc and PhD), but other classes may be required for an additional postgraduate diploma before such eligibility.

Furthermore, all graduating students are obliged to do the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) requirement, which usually takes one year, after which they are eligible to pursue higher degrees. The NYSC is a paramilitary service that involves students&#x27; being posted to different parts of the country to serve in various capacities. Principal objectives of the NYSC are to forge national cohesion, encourage students to apply their obtained knowledge to solving problems of rural Nigeria, and others. The NYSC was established by law after the Nigerian Civil War.

Polytechnical schools (polytechnics) in Nigeria are not considered universities. They are mandated to educate technicians of high calibre; they offer the OND (ordinary national diploma) and the HND (higher national diploma). The polytechnics focus very strongly on practical technical training. The BSc and HND are compared in engineering circles, but there are significant differences in training philosophies.

Honours degrees in Nigeria are differentiated only on the basis of performance. Honours degrees include the first-class degree, second-class degrees (upper and lower) and the third-class degree, but not the pass. All university students must do an independent research project which applies the knowledge obtained during the previous years of study.

The project work must be submitted in the semester before graduation and usually takes a significant number of points. Further course work is not precluded during the project work, but the courses are fewer and are at an advanced level. Project work is orally defended before the faculty and before peers. In the sciences and engineering a demonstration of the project is usually required. The exceptions are theoretical work.

====South Africa====
In South Africa, an honours degree is an additional postgraduate qualification in the same area as the undergraduate major, and requires at least one further year of study as well as a research report.

====Tunisia====
In Tunisia, a bachelor&#x27;s degree is referred to as &quot;al-ʾijāzah&quot; in Arabic, or &#x27; in French; the degree takes three years to complete and is a part of the LMD (&#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;) reform, students can enroll in a bachelor&#x27;s degree program in different fields of study after having obtained their &quot;&quot; (the national secondary education test). The degree is typically identical to the program of France&#x27;s universities, as specified in the LMD reform. Most universities in Tunisia offer the 3-year bachelor&#x27;s degree, except some fields, which are Medicine, Pharmacy, Engineering, Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, solely offered by Tunis Business School and lasts 4 years.

===Americas===
The region typically confers associates, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, doctoral, and postdoctoral degrees to graduating students.

====Brazil====
In Brazil, a bachelor&#x27;s degree takes from three years to six years to complete depending on the course load and the program. A bachelor&#x27;s degree is the title sought by Brazilians in order to be a professional in a certain area of human knowledge. Master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees are additional degrees for those seeking an academic career or a specific understanding of a field.

Even without a formal adhesion to the Bologna system, a Brazilian &quot;bachelor&#x27;s&quot; would correspond to a European &quot;first cycle&quot;. A Brazilian &quot;bachelor&#x27;s&quot; takes three to six years for completion, as well as usually a written monograph or concluding project, in the same way that a European bachelor&#x27;s can be finished in three to four years, after which time Europeans may embark on a one- to two-year 2nd cycle program usually called a &quot;master&#x27;s&quot;, according to the Bologna Process.

Depending on programs and personal choices, Europeans can achieve a master&#x27;s degree in as little as four years (a three-year bachelor&#x27;s and a one-year master&#x27;s) and as long as six years (a four-year bachelor&#x27;s, a two-year master&#x27;s) of higher education. In Brazil it would be possible to have a specialization &quot;lato-sensu&quot; degree—which differs from a Brazilian &quot;stricto-sensu&quot; master&#x27;s degree—in as little as three years (two years for a &quot;&quot; degree and an additional year for a specialization) or as long as eight years (six years for professional degrees, plus two years for a master&#x27;s &quot;stricto-sensu&quot; degree—typical in medicine or engineering).

====Canada====
Education in Canada is governed independently by each province and territory; however, a common framework for degrees was agreed to by the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada, in 2007. This adopted descriptors for bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees that were deliberately similar to those defined by the Bologna Process.

Under the framework, four general forms of bachelor&#x27;s degree are defined: general programs that provide a broad education and prepare graduates for graduate-entry professional programs or employment generally; in-depth academic programs in a specific subject that prepare graduates for postgraduate study in the field or employment generally; applied programs that concentrate on a mastery of practice rather than knowledge; and professional programs, often (but not exclusively) graduate-entry, that prepare graduates to practice as professionals in a specific field. This last category includes graduate-entry degrees titled as if they were doctorates, such as MD, JD and DDS degrees—despite their names, these are considered bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

Bachelor&#x27;s degrees may take either three or four years to complete and are awarded by colleges and universities. In many universities and colleges, bachelor&#x27;s degrees are differentiated either as (ordinary) bachelor&#x27;s or as honours bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The term &quot;honours&quot; is an academic distinction, which indicates that students must achieve their bachelor&#x27;s degree with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs. The honours degrees are sometimes designated with the abbreviation in brackets of &quot;(Hon(s))&quot;.

Going back in history, the &quot;Bachelor with Honours&quot; (Latin &quot;baccalaureatus cum honore&quot;, ) was traditionally taken as the highest undergraduate degree. The program requires at least 4 years of studies, with strong emphasis on the research-based &quot;Honours Seminar Thesis&quot; which is considered approximately equivalent to a formal master&#x27;s thesis. Universities show the academic degree as well as the possible honours distinction (Latin honours) on the diploma (e.g., &quot;&quot;).

In Quebec, students have to take a minimum of two years of college before entering, for example, a three-year Bachelor of Science (BSc) or a four-year Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) program. As a consequence, there is no &quot;de jure&quot; &quot;honours degree&quot; (although some universities market some of their programs as being &quot;de facto&quot; honours degrees in their English-language materials) but there are some specializations called &quot;concentrations&quot; in French, which are mostly taken as optional courses.

In the province of Ontario, the most bachelor&#x27;s degrees offered by Ontario universities are academic in nature. In contrast, Ontario legislation requires bachelor&#x27;s degrees offered by Ontario colleges to be applied and vocationally focused.

====Colombia====
In Colombia, secondary school has two milestones, in 9th and 11th grades. After completing the first 4 years of secondary school (6th, 7th, 8th and 9th grades), a student is considered to have completed the basic secondary school while after completed the last two years (10th and 11th grades) is considered to have completed &quot;bachillerato&quot; or high school diploma.

This degree can be either academic (the most common) or:
* military, given by military specialised schools. It provides the opportunity for male students not to go to otherwise compulsory military service.
* commercial, which grants students focused skills on accountancy.
* technical, which grants students focused skills on technical abilities such as electricity, mechanics and related matters.
* academic, which grants students focused skills on elementary education.

After graduating from high-school, hopeful students must take a nationwide exam that determines their eligibility to apply for their desired program, depending on the score the student achieves on the exam. In Colombia, the system of academic degrees is similar to the US model. After completing their &quot;&quot; (high school), students can take one of three options. The first one is called a &quot;profesional&quot; (professional career), which is similar to a bachelor&#x27;s degree requiring from four to six years of study according to the chosen program. However, strictly-career-related subjects are taken from the very beginning unlike US where focused career-related subjects usually are part of the curriculum from the third year. The other option is called a &quot; (technician); this degree consists of only two and a half years of study and prepares the student for technical or mechanical labors. Finally, the third option is called a &quot; (equivalent to an associate degree), and consist of 3 years of study. A technical school gives to the student, after a program of two years, an undergraduate degree in areas like software development, networks and IT, accountancy, nursing and other areas of health services, mechanics, electricity and technic-like areas.

Universities offer graduate degrees in ICFES endorsed programs like medicine, engineering, laws, accountancy, business management and other professional areas. A typical undergraduate program usually takes 10 or 11 semesters and some (i.e. medicine) require an additional period of service or practice to apply for the degree. A student who has obtained an undergraduate degree can opt to continue studying a career after completing their undergraduate degree by continuing onto master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees. They can also choose to do a specialization in certain fields of study by doing an extra year.

====Costa Rica, El Salvador and Venezuela====
In these countries, there are two titles that should not be confused:

# High school students who pass their &quot;&quot; or high school exams obtain a certificate of &quot; (not the same as a &#x27;Bachelor&#x27; for higher education degrees)&quot;, which is needed in order to enter a university and is usually requested by companies in their profiles.
# University students obtain an American equivalent bachelor&#x27;s degree in their respective fields after completing four years of education, and a &quot;licenciatura&quot; licentiate degree completing one more year of studies (and meeting other requisites unique to each institution, it is common to write a dissertation on the professional field), this enables them to work as professionals in their chosen areas; for example, a &quot;&quot; (&quot;Licentiate degree in secondary education&quot;) enables a person to work as a high school teacher. Currently, the trend is for universities not to offer a bachelor&#x27;s degree and to offer instead a licentiate&#x27;s or &quot;&quot; degree after five years of education.

====Guyana====
In Guyana, the universities offer bachelor programs in different streams like Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science in nursing, design and arts, liberal arts, psychology, Doctor of Medicine (MD) and other health science programs. These programs are delivered by University of Guyana, Texila American University, Green Heart Medical University, Lesley university and many more offers these bachelor programs.

====Mexico====
Bachelor&#x27;s degrees may take an average of five years (from four to five years) to complete depending on the course load and the program and they are awarded by colleges and universities. Medicine is from 6 to 7 years. Each college has its own curriculum and requirements with an emphasis of their choice, governed independently by each state of the republic. After finishing all the subjects the student require a final work, which means the completion of particular honours seminars, research and development or a written thesis in a particular field. Mexico&#x27;s regulations established as an obligation in order to receive their license and title the fulfillment of a &quot;social service&quot; to the nation (usually for those who finished their studies in a public institution) as a remuneration to society in the form of social actions, the benefits, as students, were received during training. This requirement takes about six months to one year depending on the type of degree. Bachelor&#x27;s degree should not be falsely related with its Spanish cognate &quot;bachiller&quot;, which designate a prerequisite for matriculate in a career or bachelor studies. The official name for a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Mexico is &quot;licenciado&quot; and such studies are referred as &quot;licenciatura&quot;.

Bachelor&#x27;s degrees should not be confused with Engineering Degrees, where an &quot;Ingeniería&quot; is prefixed to the name and requires additional courses for certification as an Engineer.

====United States====
Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the United States are typically designed to be completed in four years of full-time study, which typically represents an average of 15 hours of weekly instruction per four-month semester, two semesters per year, for a total of eight semesters and 120 instructional credit hours, although some programs, such as engineering or architecture, may take five years, and some universities and colleges allow students, usually with the help of summer school, who are taking many classes each semester or who have existing credit from high school Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate course exams, to complete them more rapidly. Some US colleges and universities have a separate academic track known as an &quot;honours&quot; or &quot;scholars&quot; program, generally offered to the top percentile of students, based on GPA, that offers more challenging courses or more individually directed seminars or research projects instead or in addition to the standard core curriculum. Those students are awarded the same bachelor&#x27;s degree as students completing the standard curriculum but with the notation &quot;in cursu honorum&quot; on the transcript and the diploma. Usually, the above Latin honours are separate from the notation for this honours course, but a student in the honours course generally must maintain grades worthy of at least the &quot;cum laude&quot; notation anyway. Hence, a graduate might receive a diploma &quot;Artium Baccalaureatum rite&quot; or &quot;Artium Baccalaureatum summa cum laude&quot; in the regular course or &quot;Artium Baccalaureatum summa cum laude in cursu honorum&quot; in the honours course.

If the student has completed the requirements for an honours degree only in a particular discipline (e.g., English language and literature), the degree is designated accordingly (e.g., &quot;BA with Honours in English&quot;). In this case, the degree candidate will complete the normal curriculum for all subjects except the selected discipline (&quot;English&quot;, in the preceding example). The requirements in either case usually require completion of particular honours seminars, independent research at a level higher than usually required (often with greater personal supervision by faculty than usual), and a written honours thesis in the major subject.

Many universities and colleges in the United States award bachelor&#x27;s degrees with Latin honours, usually (in ascending order) &quot;cum laude&quot; (&quot;with honour/praise&quot;), &quot;magna cum laude&quot; (&quot;with great honour/praise&quot;), &quot;summa cum laude&quot; (&quot;with highest honour/praise&quot;), and the occasionally seen &quot;maxima cum laude&quot; (&quot;with maximal honour/praise&quot;). Requirements for such notations of honours generally include minimum grade point averages (GPA), with the highest average required for the &quot;summa&quot; distinction (or &quot;maxima&quot;, when that distinction is present). In the case of some schools, such as Bates College, Carleton College, Colby College, Middlebury College, Guilford College, Franklin College Switzerland, and larger universities like the University of Virginia, Princeton University, North Carolina State University, University of Massachusetts Amherst, a senior thesis for degrees in the humanities or laboratory research for natural science (and sometimes social science) degrees is also required. Five notable exceptions are Reed College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, The Evergreen State College, Sarah Lawrence College, and Bennington College, which do not have deans&#x27; lists, Latin honours recognitions, or undergraduate honours programs or subjects.

===Asia===
====Bangladesh====
In Bangladesh, universities and colleges award three- and four-year degrees (three-year degrees courses are called pass courses and four-year degree courses are called honours courses) in science and business BSc, BBS, BBA, , etc. and three- and four-year degrees in arts (BA, BSS, etc.). Engineering universities provide four-year degree programs for bachelor&#x27;s degree courses of study (BSc in Eng and BSc). Medical colleges have five-year degree programmes (MBBS, BDS). In law education there is a two-year LLB degree after completing three years in a BA program for a total of five years of study. There is also a four-year LLB honours degree. The Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) and Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) are professional degrees awarded to students who complete a five-year course of study in the field at some universities. All of these programs begin after achieving the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC – in total 12 years of school education).

====China====
There are 13 kinds of &quot;statutory&quot; bachelor&#x27;s degrees in China: Bachelor of Philosophy, Economics, Laws, Education, Arts, History, Science, Engineering, Agriculture, Medicine, Management, Military Science, and Fine Arts.

Since the undergraduate education system in China is modeled after its American counterpart, all of the degrees are adapted from those of the United States except for the issuing of the degree certificate. Once a student has fulfilled their course requirements, a &quot;graduate certificate&quot; will be given. In order to get the degree, a student must finish and pass the dissertation stage; only then will they be awarded a degree certified by the Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Most bachelor&#x27;s degree in China needs four years to complete, with the exception that the Bachelor of Medicine degree requires five years. Although some colleges (), vocational colleges () and colleges in some universities offer two or three year programs for students, they can not graduate with any degree, except for those who pass the upgrade exam during college and then study an extra two-year undergraduate course at another university and pass a dissertation.

Any Chinese citizen can also get a bachelor&#x27;s degree via the undergraduate majors of the Self-Taught Higher Education Examinations ().

====India====
Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in India normally take three years of study to complete, although courses like BE/BTech, MBBS, BVSc or BArch take longer. A BE/BTech usually takes 4 years, while an MBBS or BArch usually takes 5 years to complete. Most of the Science, Commerce, and Arts degrees are honours degrees with electives chosen by the student. With the implementation of National Education Policy 2020, undergraduate degree programs will take 4 years with an option to leave the program in 3 years.

Students usually start their bachelor&#x27;s after completing their Class XII from either a National or State Board.

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, most of the current bachelor&#x27;s degrees are domain-specific degrees. Therefore, there are more than 20 bachelor&#x27;s degrees. For instance, S.Psi. for &#x27; (literally translated as &quot;Bachelor of Psychology/BPsy, BA&quot;), S.T. for &#x27; (literally translated as &quot;Bachelor of Engineering&quot;), S.Si. for &#x27; (literally translated as &quot;Bachelor of Science&quot;), S.Farm. for &#x27; (literally translated as &quot;Bachelor of Pharmacy&quot;), S.E. for &#x27; (literally translated as &quot;Bachelor of Economy&quot;), S.Kom. for &#x27; (literally translated as &quot;Bachelor of Computer Science&quot;), S.S. for &#x27; (literally translated as &quot;Bachelor of Literature&quot;) or S.Sos. for &#x27; (literally translated as &quot;Bachelor of Social Sciences&quot;). In the past, the Indonesian academic system adopted the old European/western degrees, such as the Ir (&quot;insinyur&quot; from Dutch &quot;&quot;) for an engineering degree and the common academic degree (&quot;doktorandus&quot; from Dutch and ultimately Latin &quot;doctorandus&quot;) for a degree in either social or natural sciences.

====Iran====
In Iran, students can study different undergraduate or postgraduate courses leading to a BS, a MS or a PhD that is recognised and equivalent to similar qualifications given in other countries. Students can also provide three to six (often four) years of education leading to a BS.

====Jordan====
Since the undergraduate education system in Jordan is modeled after its American counterpart, all the degrees are adapted from those of the United States excepting the release of the degree certificate. Once a student has fulfilled their course requirements, a graduate certificate will be given. In order to get the degree in some majors of study, a student must finish and pass the dissertation stage; only then will they be awarded a degree credentialed by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Four years of education is the standard length.

====Malaysia====
Institutes of higher learning in Malaysia provide three or four years of education leading to a BSc Hons Degree (). The standards of categorization is almost consistent among Malaysian Universities. Candidates who excel in their academic results will be awarded a First Class Bachelor Hons Degree (usually 3.67 CGPA and above), followed by Class Second Upper (usually between 3.00 and 3.66 CGPA), Class Second Lower (usually 2.50–2.99 CGPA), Class Three (usually 2.00–2.49 CGPA).

====Nepal====

In Nepal, the bachelor&#x27;s degree was initially a three-year program for courses, like Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS), Bachelor of Sciences (BSc), Bachelor of Education (BEd), Bachelor of Arts (BA) from Tribhuvan University, Pokhara University, Purbanchal University and Kathmandu University but now it is mostly a four-year program for new courses like Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Bachelor of Business Information Systems (BBIS), Bachelor of Information Management (BIM), Bachelor of Engineering (BE), Bachelor of Science in Computer Studies and Information Technology (BScCSIT). Some bachelor&#x27;s programs are still three years long, such as the Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Education (BEd). It is completed after 10+2 level (high school) or diploma or any other equivalent level of studies. Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Bachelor of Information Management (BIM), Bachelor of Business Information Systems (BBIS), Bachelor of Engineering, and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Information Technology (BScCSIT) are a few popular bachelor&#x27;s degree programs. BSc and BBSc have recently turned into four-year programs from three-year programs. In Nepal, Tribhuvan University as an oldest and biggest University based on number of student and academic department, Kathmandu University, Purbanchal University, Pokhara University, Nepal Sanskrit University and other new regional universities are operating currently. MBA and BBA from all universities are examined under the system of percentage and GPA, and traditional university courses are accessed on division base like pass division, second division, first division and distinction. In Nepal, there is no top up, honours and exchange or related tie up degree courses authorized and practiced by Nepalese Government and other educational institutions, but today, affiliation with foreign universities, online and distance learning are popular with the young modern working population. MBA, BBA, BPharmacy, BSc Nursing, Bachelor of Nursing (BN), BE are in high professional demand in Nepalese market. For admission in a university, a compulsory admission test given by the respective university is to be passed by a student in order to get placement in an affiliated college of that university for the specific subject category. In the test, a separate quota is also awarded for females and disadvantaged groups to create diversity and equality.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, arts, commerce, and science colleges provide four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees (BS, BSc (Hons), BBA (Hons), BCom (Hons), etc.). Formerly, two-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees were awarded as BA BSc and B.Com., which were renamed as associate degrees (ADA, ADS) in 2018–19 by HEC Pakistan. Generally these programs are of four year&#x27;s duration as elsewhere in the world and begin after completing higher secondary school education by receiving a Higher Secondary School Certificate (acknowledging one&#x27;s twelve years of study by the respective board). After successful completion of these programs, a bachelor&#x27;s degree is awarded by the respective university. Engineering and medical colleges provide four- and five-year degree programs, respectively, for bachelor&#x27;s degrees (BE/BS/BSc Engg and MBBS) that also begin after higher secondary school year 12. The Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) degree program is of five years&#x27; duration.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, where the term &quot;course&quot; is commonly used to refer to a bachelor&#x27;s degree major, course of study or program, several undergraduate categories exist—the two most common degrees awarded being Bachelor of Science (BSc) and Bachelor of Arts (BA or AB). Specializations (&quot;majors&quot;) in economics, business administration, social work, agriculture, nursing, accountancy, architecture and engineering are offered as BS degrees in most colleges and universities. Other common degrees are Bachelor in Education (BEd) and Bachelor of Laws (LLB, a professional degree). Being patterned after the United States, all universities and colleges offer graduation with honours – &quot;cum laude&quot;, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, and &quot;summa cum laude&quot;.

====South Korea====
Universities, colleges, and institutions of higher learning provide the bachelor&#x27;s degree, called &#x27;haksa&#x27; (). For example, a university student who majored in literature and graduates obtains a BA, called &#x27;munhaksa&#x27; (). Even if they do not go to an institution of higher learning, a person can get a bachelor&#x27;s degree through the Bachelor&#x27;s Degree Examination for Self-Education.

====Sri Lanka====
Recognized institutes of higher learning only are authorized to award degrees in Sri Lanka. Three years full-time bachelor&#x27;s degree without an area of specialization is known as a general degree. A degree with a specialization (in accounting, chemistry, plant biotechnology, zoology, physics, engineering, IT, law, etc.) is known as an honours degree and requires four years (120 credits or more) of study and more entrance qualifications. A degree in medicine, an MBBS, requires a minimum of six years.

====Turkey====
There are institutions which award bachelor&#x27;s degrees in almost every city in Turkey. Examples are Ankara University, Bilkent University, Boğaziçi University, Marmara University, Hacettepe University, Istanbul Bilgi University, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul University, Koç University, Kocaeli University, Middle East Technical University, Sabancı University, Yeditepe University, Gaziantep University, Istanbul Gelisim University and Yıldız Technical University. They all grant bachelor of arts or science degrees upon completion of an eight-semester course. There are opportunities to undertake a double major. Turkey is participating in the Bologna Process.

===Europe===
Bachelor&#x27;s degrees exist in almost every country in Europe. However, these degrees were only recently introduced in some Continental European countries, where bachelor&#x27;s degrees were unknown before the Bologna process. Some countries like France call it &quot;Licence&quot;. Undergraduate programs in Europe overall lead to the following most widely accepted degrees:

* Bachelor of Science degree (BSc), 35%–40% of undergraduate programs;
* Bachelor of Arts degree (BA), 30%–35% of undergraduate programs;
* Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB), 1% of total programs, widely accepted in the law discipline.
The rest of the programs typically lead to a Bachelor of Engineering degree (BEng), Bachelor of Business Administration degree (BBA), or other variants. Also, associate degrees are rising in popularity on the undergraduate level in Europe.

On a per-country, per-discipline and sometimes even per-institute basis, the duration of an undergraduate degree program is typically three or four years, but can range anywhere from three to six years. This is an important factor in the student&#x27;s decision-making process.

====Austria====
The historical situation in Austria was very similar to that in Germany, with the traditional first degrees being the &quot;magister&quot; and the &quot;diplom&quot;, which are master&#x27;s-level qualifications. From 2004, bachelor&#x27;s degrees have been reintroduced as part of the Bologna Process reforms. These can be studied at universities, leading to a bachelor&#x27;s degree (BA or BSc) after three or four years, and at Fachhochschulen (universities of applied science), leading to a &quot;bachelor (FH)&quot; after three years.

====Belgium====
Education in Belgium is run by the language communities, with separate higher education systems being administered by the Flemish Community and the French Community. Both systems have been reformed to align with the Bologna Process, the Flemish Community from 2003 and the French Community from 2004. In the Flemish Community, bachelor&#x27;s degrees may be either academic or professional. These degrees last three years, and may be followed in both cases by an advanced bachelor diploma (; ), lasting one year (c.f. the Australian bachelor honours degree). All of these qualifications are at level 6 on the EQF, to which the Flemish Qualification Framework was referenced in June 2011. In the French Community, universities award &quot;grade de bachelier&quot; (3 years) as the equivalent of bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Outside of universities, professional programs may be &quot;type long&quot; (long type) or &quot;type court&quot; (short type), both of which are offered at &quot;hautes ecoles&quot; and &quot;ecoles supérieures des arts&quot;. The long type takes in a &quot;grade de bachelier (type long)&quot; (3 years), which is followed by a &quot;master&quot; degree (1 or 2 years), while the short type has a &quot;grade de bachelier professionnalisant (type court)&quot; (3 years), which may be followed by a &quot;bachelier de spécialisation&quot; (1 year). All &quot;bachelier&quot; degrees (including the &quot;bachelier de spécialisation&quot;) are equivalent to level 6 of the EQF, but have not been formally referenced.

====Croatia====
Most public universities and community colleges in Croatia today offer a three-year bachelor program, which can be followed up typically with a two-year master&#x27;s (graduate) program.
All bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Croatia are professional. For distinction, in universities the title is &quot;univ. bacc.&quot; (university bachelor) and in community colleges is just &quot;bacc.&quot;.

Zagreb School of Economics and Management has a four-year bachelor&#x27;s program.
Academies that specialize in the arts, e.g. the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, have four-year bachelor&#x27;s programs followed by a one-year master&#x27;s.

====Czechia====
Historically, the baccalaureus was the undergraduate degree awarded to students who graduated from the course of trivium (grammar, dialectic and rhetoric) at a faculty of liberal arts (either at the Charles University or at the University of Olomouc). It was a necessary prerequisite to continue either with the faculty of liberal arts (quadrivium leading to a master&#x27;s degree and further to a doctoral degree) or to study at one of the other three historical faculties—law, medicine or theology.

A bachelor&#x27;s degree, abbreviated BcA, in the field of fine arts, and Bc (&quot;Bakalář&quot; in Czech) in other fields is awarded for accredited undergraduate programs at universities and colleges.

The vast majority of undergraduate programmes offered in the Czech Republic have a standard duration of three years.

In the Czech tertiary education system, most universities and colleges today offer a three-year bachelor program, which can be followed up typically with a two-year master&#x27;s (graduate) program. Some specializations, such as doctors of medicine and veterinary doctors, hold exceptions from the general system in that the only option is a six-year master&#x27;s program with no bachelor stage (graduate with title doctor). This is due mainly to the difficulty of meaningfully splitting up the education for these specialisations.

====Denmark====
The bachelor&#x27;s degree was re-introduced at universities in Denmark in 1993, after the original degree (baccalaureus) was abandoned in 1775. The bachelor&#x27;s degree is awarded after three or four years of study at a university and follows a scheme quite similar to the British one. Two bachelor&#x27;s degrees are given at the university level today:
* Bachelor of Science (BSc), awarded to students with main focus on scientific, medical, or technical areas;
* Bachelor of Arts (BA), awarded to students whose main focus is on humanistic, theological, or jurisprudence areas.
However, both in the business and the academic world in Denmark, the bachelor&#x27;s degree is still considered to be &quot;the first half&quot; of a master&#x27;s (candidatus). It is often not considered a degree in its own right, despite the politicians&#x27; best attempts to make it more accepted.

The bachelor&#x27;s degree has also been used since the late 1990s in a number of areas like nursing and teaching. Usually referred to as a &quot;professional bachelor&quot; (Danish: &quot;professionsbachelor&quot;), these degrees usually require 3 to years of combined theoretical and practical study at a &quot;professional university college&quot; (Danish: &quot;professionshøjskole&quot;) or &quot;business academy&quot; (Danish: &quot;erhvervsakademier&quot;). These professional bachelor&#x27;s degrees do grant access to some university master&#x27;s program. These professional bachelor&#x27;s degrees are considered to be a full education.

====France====
The traditional bachelor&#x27;s degree is the equivalent of the French &quot;Licence&quot; three-year degree. Since the new European system of 2004 LMD Bologna process was founded, it has become standard to recognize a bachelor&#x27;s degree over three years with a &quot;licence&quot; degree, a master&#x27;s degree over five years, and a doctorate over eight years.

Some private institutions are however literally naming their degrees &quot;bachelor.&quot; Some of these &quot;bachelor&quot; are &quot;&quot;Diplômes visés&quot; (often delivered by specialized private schools, such as business, design, film or journalism schools), others are &quot;Diplômes certifiés&quot; by the French State. The others are not accredited by the French State.

====Germany====
Historically, the bachelor&#x27;s degree, called &quot;Bakkalaureus&quot;, existed in Germany since the late Middle Ages. But it was abolished by the educational reforms undertaken in 1820. The Abitur degree – the final degree received in school after a specialized &#x27;college phase&#x27; of two years – replaced it, and universities only awarded graduate degrees.

The magister degree, a graduate degree, was awarded after five years of study. In 1899, a second graduate degree, the diplom, was introduced when the &quot;Technische Hochschulen&quot; (TH) received university status. With the introduction of the universities of applied sciences, a shortened version of the latter, referred to as &quot;Diplom (FH)&quot; and designed to take three to four years, was phased in between 1969 and 1972.

However, in 1998, in order to comply with the European &quot;Bologna process&quot;, a new educational law reintroduced the bachelor&#x27;s degree (first degree after three years of study) in Germany. Today, these degrees can be called either &quot;Bakkalaureus&quot;&quot; or &quot;bachelor&quot; (in accordance with federal law), but the English term is more common. According to the Bologna model, the bachelor is followed by the post-graduate master&#x27;s degree of another two years. The traditional degrees of diplom and magister were mostly abolished in 2010, although the diplom still persists in a few subjects and universities and has been reintroduced as alternative degree in some places.

The traditional degrees have been re-mapped to the new European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) point system to make them comparable to the new bachelor&#x27;s degree. Traditional and Bologna process degrees are ranked as follows in Germany:

* Bachelor: 180, 210, or 240 ECTS points required;
* Diplom FH: 240 ECTS;
* Diplom Uni or TH: 300 ECTS;
* Master: 300 ECTS (including bachelor).

====Greece====
The Greek bachelor&#x27;s degree is called πτυχίο (transliterated to &quot;ptychio&quot;; Greek: πτυχίο; ptychio in dhimotiki from 1976–present; or defunct ; ptychion in polytonic, katharevousa up until 1976). It is earned after four to six years of undergraduate studies, depending on the field, and is a first cycle qualification in the Bologna Process with 240 or more ECTS credits. It is placed at level 6 of the national qualifications framework of Greece which is officially named Hellenic Qualification Framework (HQF), which is referenced to level 6 of the European Qualifications Framework. It is classified as a level 6 qualification in the ISCED. 
The bachelor&#x27;s degree is provided by all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), including universities, specialist HEIs, formerly technological educational institutes (TEIs) (1983–2019).

In 1995, it changed TEI six-semester-mode of undergraduate degree programme of studies legally equivalent to an ordinary bachelor&#x27;s degree (Ord) (-year; 210 ECTS, 1983–1995) into nine-semester-mode (4-year; 240 ECTS, 1995–2019).&lt;ref name=&quot;Law 4589, 2019, Government Gazette 13 Α&#x27;/29.01.2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Law 2916/2001, Government Gazette 114A&#x27;/11-6-2001&quot;&gt;&quot;Structure of Higher Education and provisions of the TEIs. Qualifications for the TEIs.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; Technical universities and some universities offer a five-year (300 ECTS) undergraduate programme leading to a Δίπλωμα (Greek) Diploma (integrated-master-level-granting, Master&#x27;s degree equivalent) at Level 7 of the HQF.

====Hungary====
In the classic, pre-Bologna educational system, Hungarian academic programs were not divided into bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. However, while an average university () degree lasted 5 years, there were undergraduate college () degrees obtainable, in either 3 or 4 years of length. These diplomas are today considered to be equivalents of a BA/BSc (undergraduate college) or an MA/MSc (university) degree.

The Bologna System was introduced in 2005, and with the last classes graduating in 2009, it is the sole form of higher education in the country. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees (, &quot;basic degree&quot;) usually last 3 years, but there are degrees in certain areas of education – most notably engineering, economics, and some natural sciences – where an additional semester is required, lengthening the program to 3,5 years. While regular master&#x27;s degrees (, &quot;master degree&quot;) are only obtainable with a pre-existing bachelor&#x27;s degree, the Hungarian system makes notable exceptions with law degrees, teacher&#x27;s degrees, medical degrees, and some unique fields of study (i.e. forestry engineering at the University of Sopron): these degrees are called non-divisional degrees (), and while technically being MA/MSc degrees, they have the same entering criteria as BA/BSc degrees, and have a span of 5 or 6 years.

====Italy====
Italian students graduate from high school at age 19, and the current higher education system includes:

* &quot;laurea triennale&quot; (&quot;three-year degree&quot;) or simply &quot;laurea&quot;, corresponds to bachelor&#x27;s degree. The course takes three years to complete and grants access to graduate degrees.
* &quot;laurea magistrale&quot;, corresponds to master&#x27;s degree and takes two years to complete.
* &quot;laurea magistrale a ciclo unico&quot;, (&quot;one cycle degree&quot;) is a title provided by particular faculties like law school and medical school. It takes 5 to 6 year to complete and grants the access to a profession.

A bachelor&#x27;s degree holder has the title of &quot;dottore&quot; (&quot;doctor&quot;)

A master&#x27;s degree holder has the title of &quot;dottore magistrale&quot; (&quot;master doctor&quot;)

In order to graduate, students must earn credits (ECTS) and write a thesis for which students have to elaborate on an argument under the supervision of a professor (generally from three to eight ECTS). Graduation marks go from 66 to 110. According to each faculty internal ruling, a &quot;lode&quot; may be awarded to candidates with a 110/110 mark for recognition of the excellence of the final project.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, the bachelor&#x27;s degree was introduced in 2002 with the change of the Dutch degree system due to the European Bologna process. Until that time, the Dutch universities did not have a Bachelor level degree (although the Candidate&#x27;s diploma existed until 1982, which was more-or-less of the same level). Prior to the Dutch degree system change a single program at the university comprised the same course load as the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programs together which led to the doctorandus degree (or for legal studies to the &quot;Meester in de rechten&quot; and engineering to &quot;Ingenieur&quot;). In 2002, with the introduction of the Bachelor&#x27;s master&#x27;s doctorate system, the single (4- or 5-year) program at Dutch universities has been changed and split into a 3-year program leading to the bachelor&#x27;s degree and a subsequent a 1- or 2-year program leading to the master&#x27;s degree.

Those who had already started the doctorandus program could, upon completing it, opt for the doctorandus degree (before their name, abbreviated to &#x27;drs.&#x27;), or simply use the master&#x27;s degree (behind their name) in accordance with the new standard. Since these graduates do not have a separate bachelor&#x27;s degree (which is in fact – in retrospect – incorporated into the program), the master&#x27;s degree is their first academic degree.

In 2003/2004, the Dutch degree system was changed because of the Bologna process. Former degrees included:

* &quot;baccalaureus&quot; (bc. for bachelor, corresponding to a BASc or BAA degree, it may be formally rendered as &quot;B&quot;, followed by the specialization field, instead of &quot;bc.&quot;)
* &quot;doctorandus&quot; (prefix abbreviated to drs.; it corresponds to MA or MSc, but it may be formally rendered as M instead of drs.),
* &quot;ingenieur&quot; (ing.) for graduates of the four-year courses offered by Dutch higher vocational colleges (HBO, that is; &quot;hoger beroepsonderwijs&quot;) see: university of applied science. It is similar to a BASc, BEng, BBE, BAS or BICT (BIT., and it may be formally rendered as B followed by the specialization field, instead of ing.
* ir. for those having graduated from technical university after a minimum of five years, corresponding to a MSc, but it may be formally rendered as M, instead of ir.),
* &quot;meester in de rechten&quot; (mr.; it corresponds to LLM, but it may be formally rendered as M instead of mr.) and
* &quot;doctor&quot; (dr.; it corresponds to PhD, but it may formally be rendered as D instead of dr.) are still granted along with their international equivalents.

While the titles ing., bc., ir., mr., drs. and dr. are used before one&#x27;s own name, the degrees B, M or D are mentioned after one&#x27;s name. It is still allowed to use the traditional titles.

Whether a bachelor&#x27;s degree is granted by a &quot;hogeschool&quot; or university is highly relevant since these parallel systems of higher education have traditionally served somewhat different purposes, with the vocational colleges mainly concentrating on skills and practical training. A BA or BSc from a university grants &quot;immediate&quot; entry into a master&#x27;s program. Moreover, this is usually considered a formality to allow students to switch to foreign universities master&#x27;s programs. Meanwhile, those having completed a HBO from a vocational college, which represented the highest possible level of vocational education available, can only continue to a &quot;master&#x27;s&quot; on completion of a challenging year of additional study, which in itself can serve as a type of selection process, with the prospective MSc students being required to cover a great deal of ground in a single year.

Recently, HBO (vocational) master&#x27;s degrees have been introduced in the Netherlands. Graduates thereof may use neither the extension &quot;of Arts&quot; (MA) nor &quot;of Science&quot; (MSc). They may use an M followed by the field of specialization (e.g., MDes).

This year of study to &quot;convert&quot; from the vocational to academic (WO – &quot;wetenschappelijk onderwijs&quot;, literally &quot;scientific education&quot;) is also known as a &quot;bridge&quot; or &quot;premasters&quot; year. Despite the use of the terminology &quot;university of applied science&quot; the higher vocational colleges are not considered to be &quot;universities&quot; within the Netherlands.

Important aspects of Dutch bachelor&#x27;s degree courses (and others) relative to some of those offered abroad include:

* Duration. While in many countries courses are completed in a given time under normal circumstances, degree courses offered at some (though by no means all) Dutch institutions, including the most prestigious, can only be completed in three years by the best performing students.
* Academic year. The Dutch academic year has a formal duration of 42 weeks. In practice students are often expected and required to spend a great deal of the &quot;free&quot; time revising for examinations. This is not always true elsewhere, as in many countries a very long summer break is taken or examinations are before the winter break rather than after.
* Learning curve. Some education systems, notably the British one, involve a gentle introduction during the first year. This is generally not the case in the Netherlands, with the difficulty level in the first year serving as a type of &quot;self-selection&quot; with less committed and less able students routinely finding it difficult to keep up.

In February 2011, the Dutch State Secretary of Education decided to adhere to the recommendations written in a report by the Veerman Commission. In the near future, the distinction between academic and higher vocational degrees will disappear.

====North Macedonia====
In 2003, the German-style education system was changed to conform to the ECTS because of the Bologna process. The existing academic degree granted with a diploma was transformed into a baccalaureus (bachelor&#x27;s degree). The universities usually award a bachelor&#x27;s degree after three years (following which, a master&#x27;s degree will be two years long) or four years (following which, a master&#x27;s degree will be one year long).

====Norway====
A bachelor&#x27;s degree in Norway requires three years of full-time studies, that is, 180 ECTS. There are some exceptions, for example physiotherapy. Norwegian bachelor&#x27;s degrees are either programme bachelor&#x27;s degrees or elective bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

====Poland====
In Poland, the licentiate degree corresponds to the bachelor&#x27;s degree in Anglophone countries. In Polish, it is called &quot;licencjat&quot;. To obtain the licencjat degree, one must complete three years of study. There is also a similar degree called engineer (&quot;inżynier&quot;) which differs from the &quot;licencjat&quot; in that it is awarded by technical universities and the program usually lasts for 3.5 years. After that, the student can continue education for 2 or 1.5 years, respectively, to obtain a &quot;magister&quot; degree, which corresponds to a master&#x27;s degree.

====Portugal====
Presently, the bachelor&#x27;s degree in Portugal does not exist.

Before the Bologna process (2006/2007), the &quot;bacharelato&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s degree) existed in the Portuguese higher education system. It required three years of study, being roughly equivalent to the present &quot;licenciatura&quot;. At that time, the &quot;licenciatura&quot; referred to a licentiate&#x27;s degree (equivalent to the present master&#x27;s degree), which required usually five years of study. A &quot;licenciatura&quot; could also be obtained by performing two years of study after obtaining a &quot;bacharelato&quot;.
Today, the former and current &quot;licenciatura&quot; degrees are referred in Portugal, respectively, as pre-Bologna and post-Bologna &quot;licenciaturas&quot;, being the post-Bologna degree equivalent to the other bachelor&#x27;s degree all over Europe, usually requiring three years of study to complete.

====Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan====
The specialist&#x27;s degree (), was the first academic distinction in the Soviet Union, awarded to students upon completion of five-year studies at the university level. The degree can be compared both to the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree. In the early 1990s, &quot;Bakalavr&quot; (Бакалавр, &quot;bachelor&quot;) degrees were introduced in all the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States except Turkmenistan. After the bakalavr degree (usually four years), one can earn a master&#x27;s degree (another one or two years) while preserving the old five-year specialist scheme.

====Spain====
In Spain, due to the ongoing transition to a model compliant with the Bologna agreement, exact equivalents to the typical Anglosphere bachelor&#x27;s degree and master&#x27;s degree are being implemented progressively. Currently, there is an undergraduate bachelor&#x27;s degree called &quot;título de grado&quot; or simply &quot;grado&quot; (its duration generally being four years), a postgraduate master&#x27;s degree called &quot;título de máster&quot; or &quot;máster&quot; (between one and two years), and a doctor&#x27;s degree called &quot;título de doctor&quot; or &quot;doctorado&quot;. The &quot;título de grado&quot; is now the prerequisite to access a master&#x27;s degree. The &quot;título de máster&quot; is now the prerequisite to access doctoral studies, and its duration and the kind of institutions that can teach these programs are regulated in the framework of the European Higher Education Area.

Spanish university qualifications are now defined by law (currently RD 1509 of 12 September 2008), included the 2008 reform was the replacement of the Catalog of titles by the Registry of Universities, Centers and Titles (RUCT)

Up until 2009/2010, the system was split into three categories of degrees. There were the so-called first-cycle degrees: &quot;diplomado&quot; or &quot;ingeniero técnico&quot;, with nominal durations varying between three and four years; there were also second-cycle degrees: &quot;licenciado&quot; or &quot;ingeniero&quot; with nominal durations varying between four and six years; and finally the third-cycle degrees: &quot;doctor&quot;. The official first-cycle degrees are comparable in terms of duration, scope, and educational outcomes to an Anglo-Saxon bachelor&#x27;s degree. Meanwhile, the second-cycle degrees are comparable in terms of duration, scope, and educational outcomes to an Anglo-Saxon bachelor&#x27;s + master&#x27;s degrees combination if compared with the Anglo-Saxon system. In this traditional system the access to doctoral studies was granted only to the holders of &quot;licenciado&quot;, &quot;ingeniero&quot; or &quot;arquitecto&quot; (second-cycle) degrees, and the &quot;master&quot; or &quot;magister&quot; titles were unregulated (so, there coexisted so-called &quot;master&quot; programs with different durations, from some months to two years, backed by universities or centers without any official recognition) and only the reputation of the program/institution could back them.

Specialisation now includes about 800 specific recognised study programmes and qualification titles although he former general qualification nomenclature has been retained so that &quot;grade/licencado&quot; is approximately BA or BSc while &quot;maestro&quot; generally indicates a practice licence similar to MA and &quot;doctorado&quot; a PhD published original research thesis.

Note: The Anglophone Bachelor&#x27;s degree should not be confused with the official university entrance precursor, the Spanish Baccalaureate qualification available to &quot;Year Twelve&quot; students. That qualification is distinct from the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme for young adults with similar aspirations.

====Sweden====
The Swedish equivalent of a bachelor&#x27;s degree is called &quot;kandidatexamen.&quot; It is earned after three years of studies, of which at least a year and a half in the major subject. A thesis of at least 15 ECTS credits must be included in the degree.

As part of the Bologna process, Sweden aligned the length of its undergraduate and graduate programmes. Previously, there was a Bachelor of Law degree (&quot;juris kandidat&quot;) which required 4.5 years of study, but this degree now has a new name, &quot;juristexamen&quot; (and is now a master&#x27;s degree called &quot;Master of Laws&quot;).
Similarly, the graduate engineering degree previously known as Civilingenjör was 4.5 years long, but was split into an undergraduate bachelor&#x27;s degree of 3 years (180 ECTS credits) and a master&#x27;s degree of 2 years (120 credits).

====Switzerland====
Like Austria and Germany, Switzerland did not have a tradition of bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. In 2003, after the application of the Bologna process, bachelor&#x27;s and graduate master&#x27;s degrees replaced the old degrees. the Rectors&#x27; Conference of the Swiss Universities granted holders of a lizentiat or diploma the right to use the corresponding &quot;master&quot; title. , certificates of equivalence are issued by the university that issued the original degree. Currently three to four years of study are required to be awarded a bachelor&#x27;s degree. A master&#x27;s degree will require another two to three years of coursework and a thesis.

====United Kingdom====
The bachelor&#x27;s degree is the standard undergraduate degree in the United Kingdom, with the most common degrees being the Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BSc). Most bachelor&#x27;s degree courses (apart from the very rare postgraduate awards, and those in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science) lead to honours degrees, with ordinary degrees generally only being awarded to those who do not meet the required pass mark for an honours degree. With the exception of the postgraduate bachelor&#x27;s degrees and bachelor&#x27;s degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science, UK bachelor&#x27;s degrees (whether honours or non-honours) are first cycle (end of cycle) qualifications under the Bologna Process. Postgraduate bachelor&#x27;s degrees and bachelor&#x27;s degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science are second cycle (end of cycle) qualifications. Some bachelor&#x27;s degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science offer intercalated degrees en route to the final qualification.

Bachelor&#x27;s degrees should not be confused with baccalaureate qualifications, which derive their name from the same root. In the UK, baccalaureate qualifications, e.g. International Baccalaureate, Welsh Baccalaureate, English Baccalaureate, are gained at secondary schools rather than being degree-level qualifications.

Until the 19th century, a bachelor&#x27;s degree represented the first degree in a particular faculty, with Arts representing undergraduate study, thus the Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) at Oxford and the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) at Cambridge, for example, were postgraduate degrees. Vestiges of this system still remain in the ancient universities, with Oxford and Cambridge awarding BAs for undergraduate degrees in both arts and sciences (although both award undergraduate BTh degrees through associated theological colleges, and Oxford awards BFA degrees in addition to the BA) and defining other bachelor&#x27;s degrees (e.g., BPhil, BCL) as postgraduate awards equivalent to master&#x27;s degrees, although many postgraduate bachelor&#x27;s degrees have now been replaced by equivalent master&#x27;s degrees (e.g., LLM for the LLB at Cambridge and MSc for the BSc at Oxford). The same historical usage of indicating an undergraduate degree by it being in the faculty of arts rather than being a bachelor&#x27;s degree gives rise to the Oxbridge MA and the Scottish MA).

Common bachelor&#x27;s degrees and abbreviations:

* Bachelor of Arts: BA
* Bachelor of Science: BSc
* Bachelor of Laws: LLB
* Bachelor of Civil Law: BCL
* Bachelor of Engineering: BEng
* Bachelor of Education: BEd
* Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery: MBBS, MBBCh, BMBS, BMBCh
* Bachelor of Dental Surgery: BDS

=====England, Wales and Northern Ireland=====
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, bachelor&#x27;s degrees usually take three years of study to complete, although courses may take four years where they include a year abroad or a placement year. Degrees may have titles related to their broad subject area or faculty, such as BA or BSc, or may be more subject specific (e.g. BEng or LLB). The majority of bachelor&#x27;s degrees are now honours degrees, although this has not always been the case historically.

Although first degree courses are usually three years (360 credits), direct second year entry is sometimes possible for students transferring from other courses or those who have completed foundation degrees, via accreditation of prior learning or more formal credit transfer arrangements. Some universities compress the three-year course into two years by teaching for a full calendar year (180 credits) rather than a standard academic year (120 credits), thus maintaining the full 360-credit extent of the course.

In addition to bachelor&#x27;s degrees, some institutions offer integrated master&#x27;s degrees as first degrees in some subjects (particularly in STEM fields). These integrate teaching at bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s level in a four-year (five-year if with industrial experience) course, which often shares the first two years with the equivalent bachelor&#x27;s course.

The normal academic standard for bachelor&#x27;s degrees in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is the &quot;honours degree&quot;. These are normally classified into one of four classes of honours, depending upon the marks gained in examinations and other assessments:

* First class honours (1st)
* Second class honours, divided into:
** Upper division, or upper second (2:1)
** Lower division, or lower second (2:2)
* Third class honours (3rd)

Some institutions have announced that they intend to replace this system of classifying honours degrees with an American-style Grade Point Average. An &quot;ordinary&quot; (or &quot;unclassified&quot;) degree, which only requires passes worth 300 credits rather than the 360 of the honours degree, may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but has not obtained sufficient passes to earn a degree. Completion of just the first two years of the course can lead to a Diploma of Higher Education and completion of only the first year to a Certificate of Higher Education.

On the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications, standard undergraduate bachelor&#x27;s degrees with and without honours are at level 6, although the courses include learning across levels 4 to 6. Honours degrees normally require 360 credits with a minimum of 90 at level 6, while ordinary degrees need 300 credits with a minimum of 60 at level 6. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science are at level 7, with learning spanning levels 4 to 7, and are not normally credit rated. The Diploma of Higher Education is a level 5 (second year of bachelor&#x27;s degree) qualification and requires 240 credits, a minimum of 90 at level 5; The Certificate of Higher Education is a level 4 (first year of bachelor&#x27;s degree) qualification and requires 120 credits, a minimum of 90 at level 4.

Other qualifications at level 6 of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications or the Regulated Qualifications Framework, such as graduate diplomas and certificates, some BTEC Advanced Professional awards, diplomas and certificates, and the graduateship of the City &amp; Guilds of London Institute are at the same level as bachelor&#x27;s degrees, although not necessarily representing the same credit volume.

=====Scotland=====
At Scottish universities, bachelor&#x27;s degrees (and the equivalent Scottish MA awarded by some institutions) are normally &quot;honours degrees&quot;, taking four years of study (or five with a year abroad or in industry), but may also be &quot;ordinary degrees&quot; (also known as &quot;pass&quot;, &quot;general&quot; or &quot;designated&quot; degrees) requiring three years of study. Honours degrees may be awarded as BA (Hons) or MA (Hons) in the arts and social sciences, or BSc (Hons) for sciences, or have more specific titles such as BEng. As in the rest of the UK, integrated master&#x27;s degrees, taking five years in Scotland, are also offered as first degrees alongside bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

An honours degree may be directly linked to professional or vocational qualifications, particularly in fields such as engineering, surveying and architecture. These courses tend to have highly specified curricula, leaving students without many options for broader study. Others, following a more traditional route, start off with a broad range of studies across the faculty that has admitted the student or, via modular study, across the whole university. Students on these courses specialise later in their degree programmes. Typically degree grades are based only on the final two years of study, after a specialisation has been chosen, so broader study courses taken in the first two years do not affect the final degree grade.

Honours degrees are subdivided into classes in the same way as the rest of the UK, depending on the overall grade achieved. These are, from highest to lowest; first class, upper second class (2:1), lower second class (2:2), and third class.

Ordinary degrees are awarded to students who have completed three years at university studying a variety of related subjects. These may be taken over a broad range of subjects or (as with honours degrees) with a specialisation in a particular subject (in the latter case, they are sometimes known as &quot;designated degrees&quot;). As ordinary degrees in Scotland constitute a distinct course of study, rather than a grade below honours degrees, they can be graded (from lowest to highest) as &quot;pass&quot;, &quot;merit&quot; or &quot;distinction&quot;. As in the rest of the UK, Certificates and Diplomas of Higher Education may be earned by those completing one and two years of a bachelor&#x27;s degree course respectively.

The first two years, sometimes three, of both an ordinary degree and an honours degree are identical, but candidates for the ordinary degree study in less depth in their final year and often over a wider variety of subjects, and do not usually complete a dissertation. A Scottish ordinary degree is thus different from ordinary degrees in the rest of the UK in comprising a distinct course of study from the honours degree. In keeping with the Scottish &quot;broad education&quot; philosophy, ordinary degrees (and more rarely honours ones) may mix different disciplines such as sciences and humanities taught in different faculties and in some cases even different universities.

Bachelor&#x27;s degrees with honours are at level 10 of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) and require 480 credits with a minimum of 90 at level 10 and 90 at level 9. Ordinary degrees are at level 9 and require 360 credits with a minimum of 90 at level 9. Both honours degrees and ordinary degrees qualify as first cycle (end of cycle) qualifications in the Bologna Process. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science are at level 11 of the SCQF and are second cycle (end of cycle) qualifications in the Bologna Process.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
In Australia, a &quot;bachelor degree&quot; is normally a three to four-year program, leading to a qualification at level 7 of the Australian Qualifications Framework. Entry to a number of professions, such as law practice and teaching, require a bachelor&#x27;s degree (a &#x27;professional&#x27; degree). Other degrees, such as Bachelor of Arts do not necessarily elicit entry into a profession, though many organisations require a bachelor&#x27;s degree for employment.

A one-year postgraduate bachelor honours degree can be achieved as a consecutive stand-alone course following a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the same field, or as an additional year as part of a bachelor&#x27;s degree program. The honours course is normally only open to those who do well in their bachelor&#x27;s degree program and involves study at a more advanced level than that bachelor&#x27;s degree. Both the bachelor and bachelor honours degrees are aligned with level 6 of the EQF, the same as British and Irish bachelor&#x27;s degrees with and without honours, and other Bologna Process first cycle qualifications.

Some bachelor&#x27;s degrees (e.g. engineering and environmental science) include an integrated honours degree as part of a four-year program. Honours is generally for students who want to take up a research track for postgraduate studies, and increasingly for those who want an extra edge in the job market. Marking scales for Honours differ; generally, First Class Honours (85–100%) denotes an excellent standard of achievement; Second Class Division 1 (75–84%) a high standard; Second Class Division 2 (65–74%) a good standard; Third Class (50–64%) satisfactory standard; a final mark below 50% is a fail of the course.

Bachelor honours degrees include a major Independent research component, allowing students to develop skills that will enable them to proceed to further study or to work in research roles in industry. First-class or second-class (upper division) honours are generally required for entry into doctoral programs (e.g. PhDs, etc.); an alternative route to doctoral study is via a &quot;masters degree&quot;.

====Fiji====
The colonial link and the establishment of the University of the South Pacific in 1968 allowed the education system to follow suit from the qualification system of the Commonwealth. University of the South Pacific is the only university in the Oceania region to be internationally recognized outside Australia and New Zealand with its bachelor&#x27;s and other awards program. It is also the highest ranked in the university ranking in the island region and also ranked above some Australian universities like the University of Canberra, University of Sunshine Coast and New Zealand universities like Lincoln University and Waikato Institute of Technology.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, only recognised institutions – usually universities and polytechnics – have degree-awarding powers.

Most bachelor&#x27;s degrees are three years full-time, but certain degrees, such as the Bachelor of Laws and the Bachelor of Engineering degrees, require four years of study. A bachelor with honours is a program of four years duration (e.g., Bachelor of Arts with Honours). A Bachelor of Medicine degree requires a minimum of six years.

Where students opt to study two bachelor&#x27;s degrees simultaneously – referred to as a &quot;conjoint degree&quot; or &quot;double degree&quot; – an extra year of study is added. The number of years of study required is determined based on the degree with the greatest number of years. For example, a BCom degree requires three years of full-time study, but a double BCom–LLB degree will require five years of full-time study because the LLB degree is four years long. Exceptional students may choose to complete a degree in a shorter amount of time by taking on extra courses, usually with the help of summer school. Students who complete a double degree program will have two separate bachelor&#x27;s degrees at the end of their studies.

Consistently high-performing students may also be invited to complete the &#x27;honours&#x27; program. The bachelor with honours usually requires an extra year of study with an extra honours thesis/dissertation. This degree is considered to fall between the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s levels on the European Qualifications Framework. An honours award is indicated by the addition of &quot;Hons&quot; to the degree name or abbreviation (for example, &quot;Bachelor of Laws (Hons)&quot;). Some honours degree courses also offer a postgraduate diploma (PGDip) as an exit qualification, which often consists of the same workload but with added flexibility. A PGDip does not usually require a dissertation. However, the student may complete one if desired. A diploma award is indicated by &quot;PGDip&quot; and the degree field (for example, &quot;PGDipArts&quot; or &quot;PGDipScience&quot;.

==Subjects==
Many other specialized bachelor&#x27;s degrees are offered as well. Some are in very specialized areas, like the five-year BIDes or BScIDes degree in industrial design. Others are offered only at a limited number of universities, such as the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University&#x27;s Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (BSFS). The University of Delaware offers a Bachelor of Applied Arts and Science (BAASc) degree, a degree which often indicates an interdisciplinary course of study for many majors within its School of Arts and Science. Stanford University&#x27;s Bachelor of Arts and Science degree is for students who are receiving one degree but who have completed two arts and sciences majors, one of which would ordinarily lead to the BA and one of which would ordinarily lead to the BSc.

At many institutions one can only complete a two-degree program if the bachelor&#x27;s degrees to be earned are of different types (e.g., one could earn a BA in philosophy and a BScCEng in chemical engineering simultaneously, but a person studying philosophy and English would receive only a single BA with the two majors). Rules on this vary considerably, however.

===Agriculture===
The Bachelor of Agriculture (BAgr) offers a broad training in the sciences. The focus of this four-year applied degree is on the development of analytical, quantitative, computing and communication skills. Students learn how to apply the knowledge and principles of science to the understanding and management of the production, processing and marketing of agricultural products, and to the management and conservation of our natural resources. All students undertake rural field trips and approved professional experience within agricultural or horticultural enterprises, natural resource management, agribusiness industries, or commercial or government organisations active in the field.

This can include ecological agriculture.

===Architecture and design===
The Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) degree is a professional degree awarded to students who complete the five-year course of study in the field at some universities. Many universities offer a BSc or BA (majoring in architecture) after the first three or four years, and then a post-graduate diploma, BArch or MArch for the following two to four years.

The Bachelor of Design (BDes) is awarded to those who complete the four- or four-and-a-half-year course of study in design, usually majoring in a specific field of design, such as interior design or graphic design.

The Bachelor of Industrial Design (BID) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by a university for a four-year course of study that specializes on the design of industrial products. Some colleges also offer four-year B.I.D. programs.

===Arts===
The Bachelor of Arts degrees (BA, AB; also known as &quot;Artium Baccalaureus&quot;) along with the Bachelor of Science degrees are the most common undergraduate degrees given. Originally, in the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin, all undergraduate degrees were in the faculty of arts, hence the name of the degree. The Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences (BAASc) is an undergraduate degree that bridges academic and work-life experiences.

===Engineering===
* The Bachelor of Engineering degree or Bachelor of Applied Science degree or Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree or Bachelor of Technology or AMIE(A&amp;B) degree is a professional degree awarded to students who have completed the three or four-year course of study in engineering. Common abbreviations include BEng, BASc, BTech and BScEng. The BAI (baccalaureus in arte ingeniaria) degree is awarded by Trinity College Dublin. Some South African universities refer to their engineering degrees as BIng (Baccalaureus Ingeniaria).
*Bachelor of Engineering degrees available to study include: aerospace, automotive, chemical, civil, computer, electrical &amp; electronic (E&amp;E), industrial, mechatronic, and mechanical engineering.

===Business and management===
===Computer science and information systems===
There are various undergraduate degrees in information technology incorporating programming, database design, software engineering, networks and information systems. These programs prepare graduates for further postgraduate research degrees or for employment in a variety of roles in the information technology industry. The program focus may be on the technical or theoretical aspects of the subject matter, depending on which course is taken.
* Theoretically oriented degrees focus on computer science and are correspondingly titled. These include the Bachelor of Computing (BComp) and Bachelor of Computer Science (BCompSc) degrees. Computer science is also offered as a major within most Bachelor of Science programs.
* The practically oriented degrees cover many disciplines from within the IT industry including software engineering, information systems, and data communications. Examples here include the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BScIT), the Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), the Bachelor of Information Technology, and the Bachelor of Applied Science (Information Technology) (BAScIT)) degrees. Many of the disciplines taught as part of these degrees are covered under other degrees, such as engineering, as well.
* Degrees combining IT with business study are also offered at many universities. Specialized programs in information systems—such as the Bachelor of Business Information Systems (BBIS) program—are often positioned as professionally oriented degrees. More general degrees here would include business degrees, such as the BBA or BCom, with information systems as a concentration.

===Economics===
A Bachelor of Economics (BEcon, BSc(Econ) and BEc) is awarded in British and Commonwealth institutions after following a rigorous programme of theoretical quantitative economic learning. Programmes usually include study of both microeconomics and macroeconomics, alongside empirical work in the form of econometrics. Economics can also be offered as a Bachelor of Science (with a more general focus on the quantitative methods) or a Bachelor of Arts (with a qualitative focus on the concepts). The Bachelor of Economics is substantially more theoretical and mathematical then the more commonly offered brethren.

===Health care===
====Medicine====
In countries following British tradition (the University of Malta is an exception), medical students pursue an undergraduate medical education and receive bachelor&#x27;s degrees in medicine and surgery (MBBChir, MBBS, BMBS, BM, MBChB, etc.).
This was historically taken at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin after the initial BA degree, and in Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin the BA is still awarded for the initial three years of medical study, with the BMBCh, MBBChir, or MBBChBAO, respectively, being awarded for the subsequent clinical stage of training. Some British universities give a bachelor&#x27;s degree in science, or medical science, midway through the medical course, and most allow students to intercalate a year of more specialized study for an intercalated Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Medical Science (BMedSc), or Bachelor of Medical Biology (BMedBiol) degree with honours.

Although notionally MB and BS are two degrees, they must be taken together. In some Irish universities, a third degree, Bachelor of Arts in Obstetrics (BAO), is added. However, this third degree is an anachronism from the 19th century and is not registerable with the Irish Medical Council. In the UK, these qualifications, while retaining the title of bachelor&#x27;s degrees, are master&#x27;s degree level qualifications.

Use of the courtesy title of &quot;doctor&quot; is attached to the profession of doctor or physician and is granted by registration, not by earning the qualifying degree. Trainee doctors in the UK are allowed to use the title once they begin their training and receive provisional registration.

The Canadian MD degree is, despite its name, classified as a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

====Dentistry====
Dentistry is offered both as an undergraduate and a postgraduate course. In countries following the British model, the first degree in dentistry is the Bachelor of Dental Surgery, which is a master&#x27;s degree level qualification in the UK. In some parts of the world, the doctorate of dental surgery (DDS) is the usual undergraduate program. Postgraduate courses such as the Bachelor of Dentistry (BDent) – awarded exclusively by the University of Sydney in Australia – require a previous bachelor&#x27;s degree.

====Midwifery====
The Bachelor of Midwifery degree is a professional degree awarded to students who have complete a three- to five-year (depending on the country) course of study in midwifery. Common abbreviations include BScMid, BM, BMid and BHScMid.

====Physiotherapy====
Physiotherapy is offered both as an undergraduate and a graduate course of study. Studies leading to the Bachelor of Physiotherapy (BPT) degree usually constitute the undergraduate program. In the graduate program, courses leading to a degree such as the Master of Physiotherapy degree are offered.

In the Canadian province of Quebec, French universities offer both undergraduate and graduate courses leading to the procurement of a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in physiotherapy and a Master of Science degree specialized in physiotherapy. McGill University, the , and the are among the post-secondary institutions that offer such programs.

====Optometry====
Optometry is a four-year or five-year course. Although students graduate with a BSc after three years of study, passing a further supervised preregistration year is required to become a fully qualified optometrist. The National Institute of Ophthalmic Sciences is among the post-secondary institutions that offer such programs. It is the academic arm of The Tun Hussein Onn National Eye Hospital and the only eye hospital based institution in Malaysia.

====Nursing====
The Bachelor of Nursing degree is a three- to five-year undergraduate degree that prepares students for a career in nursing. Often the degree is required to gain &quot;registered nurse&quot;, or equivalent, status—subject to completion of exams in the area of residence. Sometimes, though, the degree is offered only to nurses who are already registered. Alternative titles include Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Bachelor of Nursing Science, with abbreviations BScN, BN and BNSc.

====Paramedicine====
Paramedicine is offered both as an undergraduate and a postgraduate course in some countries. The Bachelor of Paramedicine (BScP, BP, BHScP) is a three- to a five-year undergraduate degree that prepares students for a career in paramedicine, paramedic services or emergency medical services. Countries such as Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have established paramedicine degree programs. The United States does not require a degree for paramedicine practice.

====Veterinary science====
The Bachelor of Veterinary Science program is generally a five-year course of study that is required for becoming a veterinarian. It is also known as the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery at some universities (BVMS). In the UK, this is a master&#x27;s degree level qualification that retains the title of bachelor&#x27;s for historical reasons. In the United States, no bachelor&#x27;s degree of veterinary science is given, only the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree is.

====Pharmacy====
The Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degree is a common undergraduate degree for the practice of pharmacy. In the United States, Canada, and France, however, all colleges of pharmacy have now phased out the degree in favor of the PharmD, or doctor of pharmacy, degree or the PhD, doctor of philosophy, degree in pharmacy. Some universities, such as the University of Mississippi, award a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences (BScPSc) degree as a part of the seven-year PharmD program after the completion of the first four years. However, the BScPSc degree does not qualify the recipient for the practice of pharmacy, for which students must earn a PharmD degree.

====Public health====
Public health is usually studied at the master&#x27;s degree level. Australia is one of the few countries where studies in Public Health are available at undergraduate level. Indeed, Australian undergraduate students may major in specific areas of Public Health such as Health Promotion/Education, Epidemiology, Healthcare Administration and Public Health Nutrition. The Bachelor of Science in Public Health (BScPH) degree is a four-year undergraduate degree that prepares students for careers in the public, private, or nonprofit sectors in areas such as public health, environmental health, health administration, epidemiology, or health policy and planning.

====Medical and health sciences====
* The Bachelor of Health Science (BHSc/BSHS) is a specialized degree awarded to students whose studies have focused on health care, health sciences, or health professions. Specific areas of study can include nursing, radiography, health care management, and health education among the other broad areas of health sciences. Some BHSc/BSHS programs are intended for prerequisite study to professional graduate programs, including physical therapy, physician assistant studies, and medicine. The degree is typically awarded following four to five years of collegiate study.
* The title BMedSc, BBioMedSc, BMedSc or BVMedSc is granted to students who have qualified in the field of biomedical science and medical science or veterinary medical science respectively. Universities that offer this course include the University of Western Ontario in Canada, University of Birmingham in the UK and the University of New South Wales, the University of Canberra, the University of Queensland, the University of Sydney, RMIT University, Flinders University, Griffith University, Monash University, Australian National University and the University of Melbourne in Australia.
* The degree of BMedSc can be awarded for students completing an intercalated degree whilst studying medicine as an intermediate award. The degree of BMedSc may also be awarded to an individual who, having followed the prescribed course of study for the degrees of MBChB, does not complete the undergraduate clinical training. In brief, this is normally awarded after the candidate has completed successfully the first three years of an undergraduate medical degree at certain UK (and Commonwealth) medical institutions.
* The Bachelor of Science in human biology degree is awarded by several universities around the world and focuses on biomedical research, health care, biotech business, pharmaceutical sciences, or a combination thereof.

====Kinesiology====
The Bachelor of Kinesiology degree (BK or BScK)is a specialized degree in the field of human movement and kinetics. Some schools still offer the subject under the aegis of a School of Physical Education as a Bachelor of Physical Education (BPE or BPhEd), although &quot;kinesiology&quot; or &quot;human kinetics&quot; is currently the more popularly accepted term for the discipline.

====Nutrition and dietetics====
Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics (BSND), Bachelor of Food Science and Nutrition (BFSN)
Specific areas of study include clinical nutrition, food technology, hospitality and services management, research, community worker, health care management, educator, sports science, agricultural sciences, private practice and other allied health fields.
The degree is awarded following four to six years of collegiate study in America (average five years), from three to four in Europe and Australia. In America (especially Latin America), Nutrition per se is separated from Dietetics, where the latter is equivalent to a technical degree.

===Aviation===
The Bachelor of Aviation (BAv) is awarded to students who complete a four-year course of study in the field of aviation.

===Divinity and theology===
The Bachelor of Divinity, Bachelor of Theology, Bachelor of Religious Studies, Bachelor of Biblical Studies, and Bachelor of Religious Education (BD, BTh, BRS, BBS, and BRE) degrees are awarded on completion of a program of study of divinity or related disciplines, such as theology, religious studies, or religious education.

Traditionally, the BD was a graduate degree rather than a first degree and typically emphasised academic theology, biblical languages, etc. However, this has become a less common arrangement.

While the theological bachelor&#x27;s degree is generally conferred upon completion of a four-year program, it is also conferred in some specialized three-year programs. From there, the next level of advancement is generally the Master of Divinity (MDiv), Master of Theology (ThM), Master of Religious Studies, or Master of Religious Education (MRE) degree. In the United States, the &quot;mainline&quot; Protestant clergy typically take a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree in whatever field they choose, then earn the MDiv (Master of Divinity) degree in an additional three years as part of preparation for ordination.

===Fine arts===
The Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree is a specialized degree awarded for courses of study in the fine arts, frequently by an arts school or conservatory, although it is equally available at a significant number of traditional colleges and universities. In contrast to the BA or BS, which are generally considered to be academic degrees, the BFA is usually referred to as a professional degree, whose recipients have generally received four years of study and training in their major field as compared to the two years of study in the major field usually found in most traditional non-Commonwealth Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science programs.

In the United States, the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree differs from a Bachelor of Arts degree in that the majority of the program consists of a practical studio component, as contrasted with lecture and discussion classes. A typical BFA program in the United States consists of two-thirds study in the arts, with one-third in more general liberal arts studies. For a BA in art, the ratio might be reversed.

===Film and television===
The Bachelor of Film and Television (BFTV) degree is an undergraduate degree for the study of film and television production including areas of cinematography, directing, film production, script writing, sound, screenwriting, animation, and typography.

===Integrated studies===
The Bachelor of Integrated Studies (BIS) is an interdisciplinary bachelor&#x27;s degree offered by several universities in the United States and Canada. It allows students to design a customized and specific course of study to best suit their educational and professional objectives. Generally, this degree is sponsored by two or more departments within the university. Schools which confer the BIS degree include the University of Manitoba, Pittsburg State University, University of South Carolina Upstate, Weber State University, Ferris State University, Arizona State University, University of Minnesota, Miami University (Ohio), the University of Virginia, the University of New Brunswick, George Mason University, and Tallinn University of Technology amongst others.

===Journalism===
The Bachelor of Journalism (BAJ or BScJ) degree is a professional degree awarded to students who have studied journalism at a four-year accredited university. Not all universities, however, grant this degree. In the United States, schools tend to offer the BA or BS with a major in journalism instead. The world&#x27;s oldest school of journalism at the University of Missouri offers a BJ degree, not to be confused with the bachelor&#x27;s degree in jurisprudence at Oxford University. In South Africa, Rhodes University has the oldest school of journalism in Africa and allows students to take a fourth-year specialisation to raise their BA to BAJ status, equivalent to a BA (Hons).

===Landscape architecture===
The Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLArch) degree is awarded to students who complete the five- (in some countries four-) year course of study in the field.

===Liberal arts===
The Bachelor of Liberal Arts, Bachelor of General Studies, Bachelor of Liberal Studies, Bachelor of Science in general studies, or Bachelor of Applied Studies (BLA, BGS, BLS, BScGS, BAS) degree is sometimes awarded to students who major in the liberal arts, in general, or in interdisciplinary studies. The Bachelor of Professional Studies is awarded to students who major in professional career studies.

===Library science===
The Bachelor of Library Science or Bachelor of Library and Information Science (BLSc, BLISc) degree is sometimes awarded to students who major in library science, although Master of Library Science degrees are more common.

===Music===
The Bachelor of Music (BMus) degree is a professional or academic undergraduate degree in music at most conservatories in the US and the UK. It is also commonly awarded at schools of music in large private or public universities. Areas of study typically include music performance, music education, music therapy, music composition, academic fields (music history/musicology, music theory, ethnomusicology), and may include jazz, commercial music, recording technology, sacred music/music ministry, or music business. Small liberal arts colleges and universities without schools of music often award only BA in music, with different sets of requirements. (see also: &quot;BFA&quot;)

=== Nonprofit studies ===
A Bachelor of Nonprofit and Nongovernmental Organization Studies is a field that focuses on practices of the nonprofit sector. This area of inquiry examines the management and effectiveness of the nonprofit sector, and has sub-areas of research including administration, marketing, communication, economics, human resources, philanthropy, ethics, law, information technology, social entrepreneurship, grant writing, policy, fundraising, advocacy, volunteerism and civic engagement.

A variety of higher education institutions and research organizations are dedicated to the teaching and research of issues related to the nonprofit sector. Additionally, individual courses within related disciplines (e.g. Business, Sociology, Public Policy) examine nonprofit studies in a variety of contexts.

Nonprofit studies may also refer to studies of the voluntary sector, third sector, nongovernmental organizations, or civil society.

===Mortuary science===
The Bachelor of Mortuary Science (BMS) is a professional undergraduate degree, awarded by the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science of Cincinnati, Ohio and Southern Illinois University Carbondale. It was introduced in 1986 and it is awarded to students that complete 120 semester hours of course work and receive passing scores on the National Board Exam administered by The International Conference of Funeral Service Examining Boards.

===Philosophy===
The Bachelor of Philosophy (BPhil. or PhB) degree is either an undergraduate or graduate degree (MPhil). Generally, it entails independent research or a thesis/capstone project.

===Psychology===
The Bachelor of Psychology degree (BPsych, or PsyB; also Bachelor of Arts or Science in Psychology, BAPsy, BScPsy) is a degree awarded to students who have completed a specialized course of study in the field of psychology – i.e. as opposed to a broad major in the subject within a general BA or BSc degree. 
Variants include the Bachelor of Arts in Applied Psychology, Bachelor of Arts in Clinical Psychology, Bachelor of Arts in Forensic Psychology, Bachelor of Arts in Organizational Psychology.
Courses typically last four years, but may be as long as six. See Psychologist#Licensing and regulation and #Education and training

===Education===
The Bachelor of Education degree (BEd) is a four-year undergraduate professional degree offered by many American colleges and universities for those preparing to be licensed as teachers. Variants include the BEd, BAEd, BAT (Bachelor of Arts for Teaching), and BST degrees. Preparation for the MS in education, this degree is most often received by those interested in early childhood, elementary level, and special education, or by those planning to be school administrators. Secondary level teachers often major in their subject area instead (i.e., history, chemistry, or mathematics), with a minor in education. Some states require elementary teachers to choose a subject major as well, and minor in education.

In Canada, the bachelor of education is a two-year professional degree in which students will specialise in either elementary or secondary education, and that is taken after the completion of a three or four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree with a major in a teachable subject, such as English, French, mathematics, biology, chemistry, or a social science. Some universities also offer concurrent, five-year programs with student completing both a bachelor&#x27;s degree in arts or science as well as their BEd. The possession of a BEd and a second bachelor&#x27;s degree is required to teach in most public anglophone and francophone schools in Canada. The BEd prepares teachers for completion of either MA (Master of Arts) programs in education, MEd (Master of Education) programs, or postgraduate certificates in education.

===Science with education===
The Bachelor of Science and/with Education degree (BScEd) is a degree awarded to students who complete the four- to five-year course of study in the field of science (major and minor in general biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics) and education. Although notionally BSc and BEd are two degrees, they must be taken together. The graduates will work as science (physics, chemistry, biology) teachers in high schools, as lecturers in pre university colleges and matriculation centers and can progress to postgraduate programs (MSc and PhD) in various areas in science or education.

===Forestry===
The Bachelor of Science in forestry (BScF) is a degree awarded to students who complete a three-year course of study in the field of forestry.

===Science===

The Bachelor of Science degrees (BSc, ScB) along with the Bachelor of Arts degrees are the most common undergraduate degrees given. The Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences (BAASc) is an undergraduate degree that bridges academic and work-life experiences.

===Science in law===
The Bachelor of Science in Law degree (BScL) is a special-purpose degree that allows someone who has had some prior studies but has not achieved a bachelor&#x27;s degree to resume his or her education and take up the study of law with the goal of eventually receiving the juris doctor degree.

===Social sciences===
The Bachelor of Social Science (BSSc) is a three- or four-year undergraduate British degree that enables students to specialize in the area of social science. Compared to the Bachelor of Arts, which allows students to study a vast range of disciplines, the Bachelor of Social Science enables students to develop more central and specialized knowledge of the social sciences. Many universities place the Bachelor of Social Science between the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science undergraduate degrees.

===Social work===
The Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree is a four-year undergraduate degree. Usually the first two years consist of liberal arts courses and the last two years focus on social work classes in human development, policy/law, research, and practice. Programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education require BSW students to complete a minimum of 400 field education or internship hours. Accredited BSW programs often allow students who are interested in obtaining a Master of Social Work degree to complete the degree in a shorter amount of time or waive courses.

In Latin America, this is a four to five-year degree that can replace liberal arts subjects into health sciences, resulting in social work as a type of community psychology and socioeconomic studies, focused in hospitals, prisons, or pedagogy, among others.

===Technology===
The Bachelor of Technology degree (BTech) is a three- or four-year undergraduate degree. Generally, the program is comparable to a Bachelor of Science degree program, which is additionally supplemented by either occupational placements (supervised practical or internships) or practice-based classroom courses.

===Law===
The Bachelor of Laws (LLB) is the principal academic degree in law in most common law countries other than the United States, and anglophone Canada, where it has been superseded by the juris doctor (JD) degree.

===Talmudic law===
The Bachelor of Talmudic Law degree (BTL) or a First Talmudic Degree (FTD) is the degree awarded in most Yeshivas around the United States.

===Tourism studies===
The Bachelor of Tourism Studies (BTS) degree is awarded to those who complete the four- or five-year course of study in tourism, laws regarding tourism, planning and development, marketing, economics, sociology, anthropology, arts and world history (dependent on the country in which one takes the course), ticketing, hospitality, computer applications, and much more. The course would have an interdisciplinary approach with a vast range of units so the tourismologist professional would be able to identify necessary actions toward a sustainable touristic environment focus on local community uniqueness, values and traditions.
As tourism is a growing industry, in India there is a lot of opportunity for those who complete this course of study. It is available in select universities of India.

===Mathematics===
The Bachelor of Mathematics or Bachelor of Mathematical Sciences degree (BMath and BMathSc) is given at the conclusion of a four-year honours program or a three-year general program. Several universities, mostly in Canada and Australia, award such degrees. The usual degree for mathematics in all other countries is the BSc.

===Urban and regional planning===
The Bachelor of Urban and Regional Planning or Bachelor of Urban Planning or just Bachelor of Planning degree (BURP, BUP, or BPlan) is a degree offered at some institutions as a four or five-year professional undergraduate degree in urban planning. Programs vary in their focus on studio work and may or may not involve professional practice.

===Innovation===
The Bachelor of Innovation is a four-year degree in a range of different fields. The major fields, in engineering, business, arts, science or education, are similar to their associated BA or BSc degrees. The general education elements are restructured to provide a common core of innovation, entrepreneurship and team skills. The degree was created as a direct response to the increasing pace of innovation in today&#x27;s society and the need for graduates that understanding effective teaming, as well as the innovation process.

<doc id="188875" wikidata="Q573040" url="?curid=188875" title="Anthony Collins (philosopher)">
<text>Anthony Collins (21 June 1676 O.S.13 December 1729 O.S.) was an English philosopher and essayist, notable for being one of the early proponents of Deism in Great Britain.

==Life and writings==
Collins was born in Heston, near Hounslow in Middlesex, England, the son of lawyer Henry Collins (1646/7–1705) and Mary (née Dineley). He had two sisters: Anne Collins (born 1678), who married Henry Lovibond (born 1675), and Mary Collins (born 1680), who married Edward Lovibond (1675–1737), a merchant and Director of the East India Company. Mary and Edward&#x27;s son was the poet .

Collins was educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and studied law at the Middle Temple. The most interesting episode of his life was his intimacy with John Locke, who in his letters speaks of him with affection and admiration. In 1715 he settled in Essex, where he held the offices of justice of the peace and deputy-lieutenant, which he had previously held in Middlesex. He died at his house in Harley Street, London.

His writings gather together the results of previous English freethinkers. The imperturbable courtesy of his style is in striking contrast to the violence of his opponents; and, in spite of his unorthodoxy, he was neither an atheist nor an agnostic. In his own words, &quot;Ignorance is the foundation of atheism, and freethinking the cure of it&quot; (&quot;Discourse of Freethinking&quot;, 105).

His first notable work was his &quot;Essay concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions the Evidence whereof depends on Human Testimony&quot; (1707), in which he rejected the distinction between &quot;above reason&quot; and &quot;contrary to reason&quot;, and demanded that revelation should conform to man&#x27;s natural ideas of God. Like all his works, it was published anonymously, although the identity of the author was never long concealed.

==&quot;A Discourse of Freethinking&quot;==
Six years later appeared his chief work, &quot;A Discourse of Freethinking, occasioned by the Rise and Growth of a Sect called Freethinkers&quot; (1713). Notwithstanding the ambiguity of its title, and the fact that it attacks the priests of all churches without moderation, it contends for the most part, at least explicitly, for no more than must be admitted by every Protestant. Freethinking is a right which cannot and must not be limited, for it is the only means of attaining a knowledge of truth, it essentially contributes to the well-being of society, and is not only permitted but enjoined by the Bible. In fact the first introduction of Christianity and the success of all missionary enterprise involve freethinking (in its etymological sense) on the part of those converted.

In England this essay, which was regarded and treated as a plea for Deism, caused a great sensation, eliciting several replies, from among others William Whiston, Bishop Hare, Bishop Benjamin Hoadly, and Richard Bentley, who, under the signature of &quot;Phileleutherus Lipsiensis&quot;, roughly handles certain arguments carelessly expressed by Collins, but triumphs chiefly by an attack on the trivial points of scholarship, his own pamphlet being by no means faultless in this very respect. Jonathan Swift also, being satirically referred to in the book, made it the subject of a caricature.

==&quot;Discourse of the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion&quot;==
In 1724, Collins published the treatise &quot;Discourse of the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion&quot;, with &quot;An Apology for Free Debate and Liberty of Writing&quot; prefixed. Ostensibly it is written in opposition to Whiston&#x27;s attempt to show that the books of the Old Testament did originally contain prophecies of events in the New Testament story, but that these had been eliminated or corrupted by the Jews, and to prove that the fulfilment of prophecy by the events of Christ&#x27;s life is all &quot;secondary, secret, allegorical, and mystical,&quot; since the original and literal reference is always to some other fact. Since, further, according to him the fulfilment of prophecy is the only valid proof of Christianity, he thus secretly aims a blow at Christianity as a revelation. The canonicity of the New Testament he ventures openly to deny, on the ground that the canon could be fixed only by men who were inspired.

No less than thirty-five answers were directed against this book; the most noteworthy of which were those of Bishop Edward Chandler, Arthur Sykes and Samuel Clarke. To these, but with special reference to the work of Chandler, which maintained that a number of prophecies were literally fulfilled by Christ, Collins replied with his &quot;Scheme of Literal Prophecy Considered&quot; (1727). An appendix contends against Whiston that the book of Daniel was forged in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes.

==Necessitarianism==
In philosophy, Collins takes a foremost place as a defender of necessitarianism. His brief &quot;Inquiry Concerning Human Liberty&quot; (1717) has not been excelled, at all events in its main outlines, as a statement of the determinist standpoint.

He was attacked in an elaborate treatise by Samuel Clarke, in whose system the freedom of will is made essential to religion and morality. During Clarke&#x27;s lifetime, fearing perhaps being branded as an enemy of religion and morality, Collins made no reply, but in 1729 he published an answer, entitled &quot;Liberty and Necessity&quot;.

==Other works==
Besides these works he wrote
* &quot;A Letter to Mr Dodwell&quot;, arguing that the soul may be material, and, secondly, that if the soul be immaterial it does not follow, as Clarke had contended, that it is immortal.
* &quot;Vindication of the Divine Attributes&quot; (1710)
* &quot;Priestcraft in Perfection&quot; (1709), in which he asserts that the clause &quot;the Church ... Faith&quot; in the twentieth of the Thirty-nine Articles was inserted by fraud.

Collins became renowned as one of the best read men in England. He was a bibliophile and book collector who amassed one of the largest private libraries of the time, consisting of some 6,906 books on all subjects, but particularly favoring works on history, theology, and philosophy.

It has been argued (see Jacobson, &quot;The England Libertarian Heritage&quot;) that Collins was the unknown author of ten of &quot;The Independent Whig&quot; essays.

==Marriages and children==
Collins married first Martha Child (1677–1703) a daughter of Sir Francis Child MP (1642–1713) and Elizabeth, (1652–1720). They had two sons both of whom died young, the eldest in infancy, the second was Anthony Collins (1723); and two daughters: Elizabeth Collins (born ) who, in 1738, married Walter Cary; and Martha Collins (1744) who, in 1741, married Robert Fairfax, 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1706–1793). His second marriage was to Elizabeth Wrottesley (born ), a daughter of Walter Wrottesley, 3rd Baronet Wrottesley (1659–1712) and Eleanora, (1661–1692).

<doc id="188878" wikidata="Q216802" url="?curid=188878" title="Falkirk (council area)">
<text>Falkirk ( ; ; ) is one of 32 unitary authority council areas of Scotland. It was formed on 1 April 1996 by way of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 from the exact boundaries of Falkirk District, one of three parts of the Central region created in 1975, which was abolished at that time. Prior to the 1975 reorganisation, the majority of the council area was part of the historic county of Stirlingshire, and a small part, namely Bo&#x27;ness and Blackness, was part of the former county of West Lothian.

The council area borders with North Lanarkshire, Stirling and West Lothian, and, across the Firth of Forth to the northeast, Clackmannanshire and Fife. The largest town is Falkirk; other settlements, most of which surround Falkirk within of its centre, include Bo&#x27;ness, Bonnybridge, Denny, Grangemouth, Larbert, Polmont, Shieldhill, Camelon and Stenhousemuir.

The council is led by the SNP which won 12 seats in the 2022 Council Election. The incumbent leader of is councillor Cecil Meiklejohn; the provost is Robert Bissett and the deputy provost is David Balfour.

==History==
The town of Falkirk was made a burgh in 1600, and was then governed by a town council (also known as the corporation) until 1975. Scotland&#x27;s counties, burghs and landward districts were abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, and replaced with upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. A new Falkirk District was created as one of three districts within the Central Region. The new district was significantly larger than the old Falkirk burgh, covering the whole area of eight former districts and part of a ninth, which were all abolished at the same time:

&quot;From Stirlingshire:&quot;
*Central No. 2 District, excluding most of Kilsyth parish
*Denny and Dunipace Burgh
*Eastern No. 1 District
*Eastern No. 2 District
*Eastern No. 3 District
*Falkirk Burgh
*Grangemouth Burgh
&quot;From West Lothian:&quot;
*Bo&#x27;ness Burgh
*Bo&#x27;ness District

The resulting area could also be defined in terms of parishes as:
*Airth
*Bo&#x27;ness and Carriden
*Denny
*Dunipace
*Falkirk
*Grangemouth
*Kilsyth: Banknock polling district only
*Larbert
*Muiravonside
*Slamannan

The new district and its neighbour Stirling were together made a new Stirling and Falkirk lieutenancy area. The last Lord Lieutenant of Stirlingshire became the first Lord Lieutenant of Stirling and Falkirk.

Local government was reformed again in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which abolished the regions and districts which had been created in 1975, replacing them with unitary council areas. Central Region was abolished and each of the area&#x27;s three districts, including Falkirk, became council areas.

==Settlements==
Largest settlements by population:

==Governance==
===Political control===
The first election to Falkirk District Council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 16 May 1975. A shadow authority was again elected in 1995 ahead of the change to council areas which came into force on 1 April 1996. Political control since 1975 has been as follows:

Falkirk District Council
Falkirk Council
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:

===Premises===
From the district council&#x27;s creation in 1975, it was based at the Municipal Buildings on West Bridge Street in Falkirk, which had been built for the former Falkirk Town Council and had been formally opened on 21 January 1966. The building was part of a complex which also included a courthouse, a clinic, and an events venue and theatre called Falkirk Town Hall. Prior to 1966 the town council had been based at the old Municipal Buildings at 12–14 Newmarket Street in the town centre, which had been built in 1879.

After deciding the 1966 building was uneconomic to repair and maintain, the council vacated the Municipal Buildings in 2020 pending their demolition. The attached Falkirk Town Hall closed in 2023. Since 2020, the council&#x27;s offices have been distributed across several buildings throughout the area. It was subsequently decided to build a new headquarters on the site of the former Callendar Square shopping centre in central Falkirk. Work began on the site in May 2024, and the new building is projected to be completed in 2027.

==Elections==

Since 2007 elections have been held every five years under the single transferable vote system, introduced by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004. Election results since 1995 have been as follows:

===Wards===

For the purposes of elections to Falkirk Council, the area is divided geographically into a number of wards which then elect either three or four councillors each by the Single Transferable Vote system. The electoral system of local councils in Scotland is governed by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, an Act of the Scottish Parliament which first introduced proportional representation to councils. These electoral wards are as follows:
==Communities==
The area is divided into 23 community council areas, eleven of which have community councils as at 2023, being those with asterisks.
*Airth Parish*
*Avonbridge and Standburn
*Banknock, Haggs and Longcroft*
*Blackness*
*Bonnybridge
*Bo&#x27;ness*
*Brightons*
*Camelon, Bantaskine and Tamfourhill*
*Carron and Carronshore
*Denny and District*
*Falkirk Central
*Falkirk South
*Grahamston, Middlefield and Westfield
*Grangemouth*
*Langlees, Bainsford and New Carron
*Larbert, Stenhousemuir and Torwood
*Lower Braes
*Maddiston
*Polmont*
*Reddingmuirhead and Wallacestone*
*Shieldhill and California
*Slamannan and Limerigg*
*Whitecross

<doc id="188883" wikidata="Q843318" url="?curid=188883" title="Osmundaceae">
<text>Osmundaceae (royal fern family) is a family of ferns containing four to six extant genera and 18–25 known species. It is the only living family of the order Osmundales in the class Polypodiopsida (ferns) or in some classifications the only order in the class Osmundopsida. This is an ancient (known from the Upper Permian) and fairly isolated group that is often known as the &quot;flowering ferns&quot; because of the striking aspect of the ripe sporangia in &quot;Claytosmunda&quot;, &quot;Osmunda&quot;, &quot;Osmundastrum&quot;, and &quot;Plensium&quot; (subtribe Osmundinae). In these genera the sporangia are borne naked on non-laminar pinnules, while &quot;Todea&quot; and &quot;Leptopteris&quot; (subtribe Todinae) bear sporangia naked on laminar pinnules. Ferns in this family are larger than most other ferns.

== Description ==
The stems of Osmundaceae contain vascular tissue arranged as an ectophloic siphonostele; that is, a ring of phloem occurs on the outside only of a ring of xylem, which surrounds pith (and no other vascular tissue).
Stipules can be discerned at the leaf bases of these ferns. The hardened leaf bases are persistent and overlap to form a hardened layer surrounding the stem. The mantle of sclerenchymatous leaf bases and intermixed roots can form a woody trunk when the stem emerges above ground, up to in &quot;Todea barbara&quot;. Extinct members of the family, which flourished during the Mesozoic, could reach the stature of trees and be termed tree ferns. The leaves are either holodimorphic, with separate fertile and sterile fronds assuming an entirely different structure, or have fertile and sterile portions of the frond very distinct in structure.

Sporangia in the Osmundaceae are large, and open at a slit on the top; the annulus that drives the sporangium opening is on the side. 128 to 512 spores are typically present. The spores are green, nearly round, and trilete. The spores germinate into gametophytes, which are green (photosynthetic) and grow at the surface. They are large and heart-shaped. The base chromosome number for members of the order is 22.

==Taxonomy==

Smith et al. (2006) carried out the first higher-level pteridophyte classification published in the molecular phylogenetic era, creating four classes of ferns (Polypodiopsida). At that time they used the term Polypodiopsida &quot;sensu stricto&quot; to apply to the largest of these. Later the term Polypodiopsida &quot;sensu lato&quot; was used to refer to all four subclasses, and the large subclass renamed Polypodiidae. This is also referred to informally as the leptosporangiate ferns. The Polypodiidae contain seven orders whose phylogenic relationship is shown in the following cladogram, where Osmundales is seen as a sister to all other members of the subclass.

=== Subdivision ===

In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification (2016) Osmundales consists of the single family Osmundaceae, six genera, and an estimated 18 species (Christenhusz and Byng give 25 species).

The three genera &quot;Osmunda&quot;, &quot;Leptopteris&quot;, and &quot;Todea&quot; were recognized as members of Osmundaceae by Smith et al. (2006) Of these, the largest genus, &quot;Osmunda&quot;, had traditionally been treated as three subgenera, &quot;Osmunda&quot; (3 species), &quot;Osmundastrum&quot; (2 species), and &quot;Plenasium&quot; (3–4 species). However, there was suspicion that the genus was not monophyletic.

The first molecular phylogeny showed that &quot;Osmunda&quot; as traditionally circumscribed was paraphyletic and that &quot;Osmunda cinnamomea&quot;, despite its morphological similarity to &quot;Osmunda claytoniana&quot;, was sister to the rest of the family. This was later confirmed by a detailed species-level phylogeny of the family by Metzgar et al. (2008) leading to the resurrection of the segregate genus &quot;Osmundastrum&quot;, by elevating it from subgenus, to contain it and render &quot;Osmunda&quot; monophyletic. &quot;Todea&quot; and &quot;Leptopteris&quot; are consistently resolved as sister groups, and &quot;Osmunda&quot; was found to contain three separate subclades corresponding to subgenera (now genera) &quot;Osmunda&quot;, &quot;Plenasium&quot;, and the recently described &quot;Claytosmunda&quot; with the single species, &quot;Osmunda claytoniana&quot;.

The following phylogram shows the relationship between the Osmundaceae genera and subtaxa, according to Metzgar et al.:

The circumscription of the order and its families was not changed, and its placement remained the same in subsequent classifications including Chase and Reveal (2009), Christenhusz et al. (2011), and Christenhusz and Chase (2014). The find of an exceptionally well preserved Jurassic fossil intermediate between genus &quot;Osmunda&quot; (as shown above) and &quot;Osmundastrum&quot; lead to a re-analysis of Metzgar et al.&#x27;s data, which revealed that the Osmundaceae root used above may be wrong and a tree-branching artefact (all other ferns are genetically very distant from the Osmundaceae), and allowing the following classification:

A molecular dating study using Metzgar et al.&#x27;s data and a comprehensive set of rhizome and leaf fossils estimated that (sub)generic differentiation within Osmundaceae started by the Triassic and was finished by the Early Cretaceous with the formation of &quot;Osmunda&quot; and &quot;Plenasium&quot;. Accordingly, the PPG I classification of 2016 continues to place Osmundales in Polypodiidae, but splits &quot;Osmunda&quot; further by elevating its subgenera to genera (&quot;Claytosmunda&quot;, &quot;Plenasium&quot;). The following cladogram reproduces the PPG I concept for the extant members of the family:

The new system was used in a comprehensive taxonomic evaluation of Osmundales rhizome fossils, who provide a polytomous key using anatomical features of Osmundaceae rhizomes and an updated ‘evolutionary’ (non-cladistic) classification of fossil and extant Osmundales (see classification concepts for groups including extinct members), which can be tentatively transferred into the following cladogram (monophyla in bold, polytomies reflect unresolved relationships)
Notes: 
a&quot;Millerocaulis&quot; is a likely paraphyletic genus that includes forms ancestral to the modern Osmundaceae (classified as Osmundeae) as well as their potential sister lineages.
bThe morphology of &quot;Claytosmunda&quot; is primitive within the Osmundinae, and total evidence indicates that &quot;Osmunda&quot; and &quot;Plenasium&quot; likely evolved from a &quot;Claytosmunda&quot;-type ancestor, rendering the latter genus paraphyletic when Osmundaceae fossil should be considered. The genus comprises 12 fossil rhizome species in addition to the sole surviving species.

=== Evolution ===
Bomfleur et al. state that “Osmundales has arguably the richest and most informative fossil record of any extant group of ferns”. The order is well represented in the fossil record from the Permian onwards. Osmundalean or potentially osmundalean fern foliage including &quot;Anomopteris&quot; Brongn., &quot;Todites&quot; Seward, &quot;Cladotheca&quot; T.Halle, &quot;Osmundopsis&quot; T.M.Harris, &quot;Cacumen&quot; Cantrill &amp; J.A.Webb, &quot;Osmunda&quot;, &quot;Damudopteris&quot; D.D.Pant &amp; P.K.Khare, &quot;Dichotomopteris&quot; Maithy, and &quot;Cladophlebis&quot; Brongn., 1849) is commonly found from the Permian onwards together with dispersed spores such as &quot;Osmundacidites&quot; Couper and &quot;Todisporites&quot; Couper. But their affinitity to the Osmundales, and Osmundaceae in particular, is difficult to judge. In the Triassic foliage becomes frequent which is similar to identical to the fronds of modern-day &quot;Todea&quot;, &quot;Osmundastrum&quot; and &quot;Claytosmunda&quot;. The better understood rhizome fossil record indicates that the group was most diverse in the Permian, and already much reduced in the Triassic regarding the number of substantially different forms (see Bomfleur et al. and literature cited therein).

The first fossil representatives of the modern Osmundaceae (= tribus Osmundeae) include rhizome fossils with &quot;Claytosmunda&quot;-anatomy or with structural features characteristic for &quot;Osmundastrum cinnomomeum&quot; and its precursors. The same holds for the equally old leaf fossil record of the group. The main diagnostic feature of Osmundeae (modern Osmundaceae) is a heterogenous sclerenchymatic ring in the stipe basis. This potential synapomorphy is the only character differentiating between Osmundeae and the paraphyletic genus collecting their potential early ancestors and sister lineages, &quot;Millerocaulis&quot;. The basic &quot;Bauplan&quot; shared with &#x27;Millerocaulis&#x27; was generally kept within the Osmundeae-lineage and only slightly to moderately modified in the last 200 million years. Triassic-Jurassic rhizome and frond morphologies remained essentially unaltered in the lineage leading to &quot;Claytosmunda claytoniana&quot;. This makes it impossible to discern direct ancestors of &quot;C. claytoniana&quot; from the ancestors of its sister lineages &quot;Osmunda&quot; and &quot;Plenasium&quot;), or their shared ancestors. Molecular dating placed the split between &quot;Osmunda&quot; and &quot;Plenasium&quot;, and their divergence from &quot;Claytosmunda&quot; in the Early Cretaceous, co-eval with the divergence between the sister genera &quot;Todea&quot; and &quot;Leptopteris&quot;. The &quot;Osmundastrum&quot;-lineage diverged much earlier (probably Middle Triassic), which fits with the new classification of re-evaluated rhizome fossils originally included in &quot;Millercaulis&quot;. A comprehensive list of rhizome and leaf fossils associated with modern Osmundaceae (Osmundeae in the classification of Bomfleur et al.) can be found at datadryad.org.

The only explicit reconstruction regarding the evolution of morphological traits in Osmundaceae can be found in Miller&#x27;s groundbreaking work. Notable is that Permian rhizomes of both families in the Osmundales, the extinct Guaireaceae and the Osmundaceae including the extant species, show already relatively complex stele anatomies in comparison to the surviving members of the group. The rhizome fossil record also indicates several independent radiations of likely arborescent lineages, the Guaireaceae and Thamnopterioideae in the Permian, &quot;Osmundacaulis&quot; in the Triassic, and &quot;Plenasium&quot; (subgenus &quot;Aurealcaulis&quot;) in the late Cretaceous to Paleogene. As already noted by Miller, highly derived forms not directly related to the extant species and genera, can be found in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, such as &quot;Millerocaulis (Osmundacaulis) kolbii&quot;. Another general trend is that the Permian Osmundales were much larger than their modern counterparts. Today, the widespread species of Osmundaceae are rhizomatous with small, low-dissected steles.

<doc id="188885" wikidata="Q452091" url="?curid=188885" title="William Whiston">
<text>William Whiston (9 December 166722 August 1752) was an English theologian, historian, natural philosopher, and mathematician, a leading figure in the popularisation of the ideas of Isaac Newton. He is now probably best known for helping to instigate the Longitude Act in 1714 (and his attempts to win the rewards that it promised) and his important translations of the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; and other works by Josephus (which are still in print). He was a prominent exponent of Arianism and wrote &quot;A New Theory of the Earth&quot;.

Whiston succeeded his mentor Newton as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. In 1710 he lost the professorship and was expelled from the university as a result of his unorthodox religious views. Whiston rejected the notion of eternal torment in hellfire, which he viewed as absurd, cruel, and an insult to God. What especially pitted him against church authorities was his denial of the doctrine of the Trinity, which he believed had pagan origins.

Whiston was born to Josiah Whiston (1622–1685) and Katherine Rosse (1639–1701) at Norton-juxta-Twycross, in Leicestershire, where his father was rector. His mother was daughter of the previous rector at Norton-juxta-Twycross, Gabriel Rosse. Josiah Whiston was a presbyterian, but retained his rectorship after the Stuart Restoration in 1660. William Whiston was educated privately, for his health, and so that he could act as amanuensis to his blind father. He studied at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School at Tamworth, Staffordshire. After his father&#x27;s death, he entered Clare College, Cambridge as a sizar in 1686. He applied himself to mathematical study, was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts (BA) (1690), and AM (1693), and was elected Fellow in 1691 and probationary senior Fellow in 1693.

William Lloyd ordained Whiston at Lichfield in 1693. In 1694, claiming ill health, he resigned his tutorship at Clare to Richard Laughton, chaplain to John Moore, the bishop of Norwich, and swapped positions with him. He now divided his time between Norwich, Cambridge and London. In 1698 Moore gave him the living of Lowestoft where he became rector. In 1699 he resigned his Fellowship of Clare College and left to marry.

Whiston first met Isaac Newton in 1694 and attended some of his lectures, though he first found them, by his own admission, incomprehensible. Encouraged after reading a paper by David Gregory on Newtonian philosophy, he set out to master Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia mathematica&quot; thereafter. He and Newton became friends. In 1701 Whiston resigned his living to become Isaac Newton&#x27;s substitute, giving the Lucasian lectures at Cambridge. He succeeded Newton as Lucasian professor in 1702. There followed a period of joint research with Roger Cotes, appointed with Whiston&#x27;s patronage to the Plumian professorship in 1706. Students at the Cotes–Whiston experimental philosophy course included Stephen Hales, William Stukeley, and Joseph Wasse.

==Newtonian theologian==

In 1707 Whiston was Boyle lecturer; this lecture series was at the period a significant opportunity for Newton&#x27;s followers, including Richard Bentley and Samuel Clarke, to express their views, especially in opposition to the rise of deism. The &quot;Newtonian&quot; line came to include, with Bentley, Clarke and Whiston in particular, a defence of natural law by returning to the definition of Augustine of Hippo of a miracle (a cause of human wonderment), rather than the prevailing concept of a divine intervention against nature, which went back to Anselm. This move was intended to undermine arguments of deists and sceptics. The Boyle lectures dwelt on the connections between biblical prophecies, dramatic physical events such as floods and eclipses, and their explanations in terms of science. On the other hand, Whiston was alive to possible connections of prophecy with current affairs: the War of the Spanish Succession, and later the Jacobite rebellions.

Whiston supported a qualified biblical literalism: the literal meaning should be the default, unless there was a good reason to think otherwise. This view again went back to Augustine. Newton&#x27;s attitude to the cosmogony of Thomas Burnet reflected on the language of the Genesis creation narrative; as did Whiston&#x27;s alternative cosmogony. Moses as author of &quot;Genesis&quot; was not necessarily writing as a natural philosopher, nor as a law-giver, but for a particular audience. The new cosmogonies of Burnet, Whiston and John Woodward were all criticised for their disregard of the biblical account, by John Arbuthnot, John Edwards and William Nicolson in particular.

The title for Whiston&#x27;s Boyle lectures was &quot;The Accomplishment of Scripture Prophecies&quot;. Rejecting typological interpretation of biblical prophecy, he argued that the meaning of a prophecy must be unique. His views were later challenged by Anthony Collins. There was a more immediate attack by Nicholas Clagett in 1710. One reason prophecy was topical was the Camisard movement that saw French exiles (&quot;French prophets&quot;) in England. Whiston had started writing on the millenarianism that was integral to the Newtonian theology, and wanted to distance his views from theirs, and in particular from those of John Lacy. Meeting the French prophets in 1713, Whiston developed the view that the charismatic gift of revelation could be demonic possession.

===Tensions with Newton===
It is no longer assumed that Whiston&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; are completely trustworthy on the matter of his personal relations with Newton. One view is that the relationship was never very close, Bentley being more involved in Whiston&#x27;s appointment to the Lucasian chair; and that it deteriorated as soon as Whiston began to write on prophecy, publishing &quot;Essay on the Revelation of St John&quot; (1706). This work proclaimed the millennium for the year 1716.

Whiston&#x27;s 1707 edition of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Arithmetica Universalis&quot; did nothing to improve matters. Newton himself was heavily if covertly involved in the 1722 edition, nominally due to John Machin, making many changes.

In 1708–9 Whiston was engaging Thomas Tenison and John Sharp as archbishops in debates on the Trinity. There is evidence from Hopton Haynes that Newton reacted by pulling back from publication on the issue; his antitrinitarian views, from the 1690s, were finally published in 1754 as &quot;An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture&quot;.

Whiston was never a Fellow of the Royal Society. In conversation with Edmond Halley he blamed his reputation as a &quot;heretick&quot;. Also, though, he claimed Newton had disliked having an independent-minded disciple; and was unnaturally cautious and suspicious by nature.

==Unorthodox religious views==

===Expelled Arian===
Whiston&#x27;s route to rejection of the Nicene Creed, the historical orthodox position against Arianism, began early in his tenure of the Lucasian chair as he followed hints from Samuel Clarke. He read also in Louis Ellies Dupin, and the &quot;Explication of Gospel Theism&quot; (1706) of Richard Brocklesby. His study of the &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; then convinced him that Arianism was the creed of the early church.

The general election of 1710 brought the Tories solid political power for a number of years, up to the Hanoverian succession of 1714. Their distrust of theological innovation had a direct impact on Whiston, as well as others of similar views. His heterodoxy was notorious. In 1710 he was deprived of his professorship and expelled from the university.

The matter was not allowed to rest there: Whiston tried to get a hearing before Convocation. He did have defenders even in the high church ranks, such as George Smalridge. For political reasons, this development would have been divisive at the time. Queen Anne made a point of twice &quot;losing&quot; the papers in the case. After her death in 1714 the intended hearing was allowed to drop. The party passions of these years found an echo in Henry Sacheverell&#x27;s attempt to exclude Whiston from his church of St Andrew&#x27;s, Holborn, taking place in 1719.

===&quot;Primitive Christianity&quot; and other religious scholarship===
Whiston founded a society for promoting primitive Christianity, lecturing in support of his theories in halls and coffee-houses at London, Bath, and Tunbridge Wells. Those he involved included Thomas Chubb, Thomas Emlyn, John Gale, Benjamin Hoadley, Arthur Onslow, and Thomas Rundle. There were meetings at Whiston&#x27;s house from 1715 to 1717; Hoadley avoided coming, as did Samuel Clarke, though invited. A meeting with Clarke, Hoadley, John Craig and Gilbert Burnet the younger had left these leading latitudinarians unconvinced about Whiston&#x27;s reliance on the &quot;Apostolical Constitutions&quot;.

Franz Wokenius wrote a 1728 Latin work on Whiston&#x27;s view of primitive Christianity. His challenge to the teachings of Athanasius meant that Whiston was commonly considered heretical on many points. On the other hand, he was a firm believer in supernatural aspects of Christianity. He defended prophecy and miracle. He supported anointing the sick and touching for the king&#x27;s evil. His dislike of rationalism in religion also made him one of the numerous opponents of Hoadley&#x27;s &quot;Plain Account of the Nature and End of the Sacrament&quot;. He was fervent in his views of ecclesiastical government and discipline, derived from the &quot;Apostolical Constitutions&quot;.

Around 1747, when his clergyman began to read the Athanasian Creed, which Whiston did not believe in, he physically left the church and the Anglican communion, becoming a Baptist.

By the 1720s, some dissenters and early Unitarians viewed Whiston as a role model.
The series of Moyer Lectures often made Whiston&#x27;s unorthodox views a particular target.

Whiston held that &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; was apocryphal and that the &quot;Book of Baruch&quot; was not. He modified the biblical Ussher chronology, setting the Creation at 4010 BCE. He challenged Newton&#x27;s system of &quot;The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended&quot; (1728). Westfall absolves Whiston of the charge that he pushed for the posthumous publication of the &quot;Chronology&quot; just to attack it, commenting that the heirs were in any case looking to publish manuscripts of Newton, who died in 1727.

Whiston&#x27;s advocacy of clerical monogamy is referenced in Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s novel &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;. His last &quot;famous discovery, or rather revival of Dr Giles Fletcher, the Elder&#x27;s,&quot; which he mentions in his autobiography, was the identification of the Tatars with the lost tribes of Israel.

==Scientific lecturer and popular author==
Whiston began lecturing on natural philosophy in London. He gave regular courses at coffee houses, particularly Button&#x27;s, and also at the Censorium, a set of riverside meeting rooms in London run by Richard Steele. At Button&#x27;s, he gave courses of demonstration lectures on astronomical and physical phenomena, and Francis Hauksbee the younger worked with him on experimental demonstrations. His passing remarks on religious topics were sometimes objected to, for example by Henry Newman writing to Steele.

His lectures were often accompanied by publications. In 1712, he published, with John Senex, a chart of the Solar System showing numerous paths of comets. In 1715, he lectured on the total solar eclipse of 3 May 1715 (which fell in April Old Style in England); Whiston lectured on it at the time, in Covent Garden, and later, as a natural event and as a portent.

By 1715 Whiston had also become adept at newspaper advertising. He frequently lectured to the Royal Society.

===Longitude===
In 1714, he was instrumental in the passing of the Longitude Act, which established the Board of Longitude. In collaboration with Humphrey Ditton he published &quot;A New Method for Discovering the Longitude, both at Sea and Land&quot;, which was widely referenced and discussed. For the next forty years he continued to propose a range of methods to solve the longitude reward, which earned him widespread ridicule, particularly from the group of writers known as the Scriblerians. In one proposal for using magnetic dip to find longitude he produced one of the first isoclinic maps of southern England in 1719 and 1721. In 1734, he proposed using the eclipses of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites.

===Broader natural philosophy===
Whiston&#x27;s &quot;A New Theory of the Earth from its Original to the Consummation of All Things&quot; (1696) was an articulation of creationism and flood geology. It held that the global flood of Noah had been caused by a comet. The work obtained the praise of John Locke, who classed the author among those who, if not adding much to our knowledge, &quot;At least bring some new things to our thoughts.&quot; He was an early advocate, along with Edmond Halley, of the periodicity of comets; he also held that comets were responsible for past catastrophes in Earth&#x27;s history. In 1736, he caused widespread anxiety among London&#x27;s citizens when he predicted the world would end on 16 October that year because a comet would hit the earth. William Wake as Archbishop of Canterbury officially denied this prediction to calm the public.

There was no consensus within the Newtonians as to how far mechanical causes could be held responsible for key events of sacred history: John Keill was at the opposite extreme to Whiston in minimising such causes. As a natural philosopher, Whiston&#x27;s speculations respected no boundary with his theological views. He saw the creation of man as an intervention in the natural order. He picked up on Arthur Ashley Sykes&#x27;s advice to Samuel Clarke to omit an eclipse and earthquake mentioned by Phlegon of Tralles from future editions of Clarke&#x27;s Boyle lectures, these events being possibly synchronous with Christ&#x27;s crucifixion. Whiston published &quot;The Testimony of Phlegon Vindicated&quot; in 1732.

==Personal life and death==
Whiston married Ruth, daughter of George Antrobus, his headmaster at Tamworth school. He had a happy family life and died in Lyndon Hall, Rutland, at the home of his son-in-law, Samuel Barker, on 22 August 1752. He was survived by his children Sarah, William, George, and John.

==Works==
Whiston&#x27;s later life was spent in continual controversy: theological, mathematical, chronological, and miscellaneous. He vindicated his estimate of the &quot;Apostolical Constitutions&quot; and the Arian views he had derived from them in his &quot;Primitive Christianity Revived&quot; (5 vols., 1711–1712). In 1713 he produced a reformed liturgy. His &quot;Life of Samuel Clarke&quot; appeared in 1730.

In 1727 he published a two volume work called &quot;Authentik Record belonging to the Old and New Testament&quot;. This was a collection of translations and essays on various deuterocanonical books, pseudepigrapha and other essays with a translation if relevant.

Whiston translated the complete works of Josephus into English, and published them along with his own notes and dissertations under the title &quot;The Genuine Works of Flavius Josephus the Jewish Historian&quot; in 1737. This translation was based on the same Greek edition of Josephus&#x27; works used by Siwart Haverkamp in his prior translation. The text on which Whiston&#x27;s translation of Josephus is based is, reputedly, one which had many errors in transcription. In 1745 he published his &quot;Primitive New Testament&quot; (on the basis of Codex Bezae and Codex Claromontanus).

Whiston left memoirs (3 vols., 1749–1750). These do not contain the account of the proceedings taken against him at Cambridge for his antitrinitarianism, which was published separately at the time.

<text>A doctorate (from Latin &quot;doctor&quot;, meaning &quot;teacher&quot;) or doctoral degree is a postgraduate academic degree awarded by universities and some other educational institutions, derived from the ancient formalism &quot;licentia docendi&quot; (&quot;licence to teach&quot;).

In most countries, a research degree qualifies the holder to teach at university level in the degree&#x27;s field or work in a specific profession. There are a number of doctoral degrees; the most common is the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to scientific disciplines.

Many universities also award honorary doctorates to individuals deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or other contributions to the university or society.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The term &quot;doctor&quot; derives from Latin, meaning &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;instructor&quot;. The doctorate (Latin: &quot;doctoratus&quot;) appeared in medieval Europe as a license to teach Latin (&quot;licentia docendi&quot;) at a university. Its roots can be traced to the early church in which the term &quot;doctor&quot; referred to the Apostles, church fathers, and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible.

The right to grant a &quot;licentia docendi&quot; (i.e. the doctorate) was originally reserved to the Catholic Church, which required the applicant to pass a test, take an oath of allegiance, and pay a fee. The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed access—at that time essentially free of charge—to all able applicants. Applicants were tested for aptitude. This right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the universities, slowly distancing themselves from the Church. In 1213 the right was granted by the pope to the University of Paris, where it became a universal license to teach (&quot;licentia ubique docendi&quot;). However, while the &quot;licentia&quot; continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;baccalaureus&quot;), the latter was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the master&#x27;s degree (&quot;magister&quot;) and doctorate, both of which now became the accepted teaching qualifications. According to Keith Allan Noble (1994), the first doctoral degree was awarded in medieval Paris around 1150 by the University of Paris.

George Makdisi theorizes that the &quot;ijazah&quot; issued in early Islamic madrasahs was the origin of the doctorate later issued in medieval European universities. Alfred Guillaume and Syed Farid al-Attas agree that there is a resemblance between the &quot;ijazah&quot; and the &quot;licentia docendi&quot;. However, Toby Huff and others reject Makdisi&#x27;s theory. Devin J. Stewart notes a difference in the granting authority (individual professor for the &quot;ijzazah&quot; and a corporate entity in the case of the university doctorate).

===17th and 18th centuries===

The doctorate of philosophy developed in Germany in the 17th century (likely 1652). The term &quot;philosophy&quot; does not refer here to the field or academic discipline of philosophy; it is used in a broader sense under its original Greek meaning of &quot;love of wisdom&quot;. In most of Europe, all fields (history, philosophy, social sciences, mathematics, and natural philosophy/natural sciences) were traditionally known as philosophy, and in Germany and elsewhere in Europe the basic faculty of liberal arts was known as the &quot;faculty of philosophy&quot;. The Doctorate of Philosophy adheres to this historic convention, even though most degrees are not for the study of philosophy. Chris Park explains that it was not until formal education and degree programs were standardized in the early 19th century that the Doctorate of Philosophy was reintroduced in Germany as a research degree, abbreviated as Dr. phil. (similar to Ph.D. in Anglo-American countries). Germany, however, differentiated then in more detail between doctorates in philosophy and doctorates in the natural sciences, abbreviated as Dr. rer. nat. and also doctorates in the social/political sciences, abbreviated as Dr. rer. pol., similar to the other traditional doctorates in medicine (Dr. med.) and law (Dr. jur.).

University doctoral training was a form of apprenticeship to a guild. The traditional term of study before new teachers were admitted to the guild of &quot;Masters of Arts&quot; was seven years, matching the apprenticeship term for other occupations. Originally the terms &quot;master&quot; and &quot;doctor&quot; were synonymous, but over time the doctorate came to be regarded as a higher qualification than the master&#x27;s degree.

University degrees, including doctorates, were originally restricted to men. The first women to be granted doctorates were Juliana Morell in 1608 at Lyons or maybe Avignon (she &quot;defended theses&quot; in 1606 or 1607, although claims that she received a doctorate in canon law in 1608 have been discredited), Elena Cornaro Piscopia in 1678 at the University of Padua, Laura Bassi in 1732 at Bologna University, Dorothea Erxleben in 1754 at Halle University and María Isidra de Guzmán y de la Cerda in 1785 at Complutense University, Madrid.

===Modern times===

The use and meaning of the doctorate have changed over time and are subject to regional variations. For instance, until the early 20th century, few academic staff or professors in English-speaking universities held doctorates, except for very senior scholars and those in holy orders. After that time, the German practice of requiring lecturers to have completed a research doctorate spread. Universities&#x27; shift to research-oriented education (based upon the scientific method, inquiry, and observation) increased the doctorate&#x27;s importance. Today, a research doctorate (PhD) or its equivalent (as defined in the US by the NSF) is generally a prerequisite for an academic career. However, many recipients do not work in academia.

Professional doctorates developed in the United States from the 19th century onward. The first professional doctorate offered in the United States was the MD at Kings College (now Columbia University) after the medical school&#x27;s founding in 1767. However, this was not a professional doctorate in the modern American sense. It was awarded for further study after the qualifying Bachelor of Medicine (MB) rather than a qualifying degree. The MD became the standard first degree in medicine in the US during the 19th century, but as a three-year undergraduate degree. It did not become established as a graduate degree until 1930. As the standard qualifying degree in medicine, the MD gave that profession the ability (through the American Medical Association, established in 1847 for this purpose) to set and raise standards for entry into professional practice.In the shape of the German-style PhD, the modern research degree was first awarded in the US in 1861, at Yale University. This differed from the MD in that the latter was a vocational &quot;professional degree&quot; that trained students to apply or practice knowledge rather than generate it, similar to other students in vocational schools or institutes. In the UK, research doctorates initially took higher doctorates in Science and Letters, first introduced at Durham University in 1882. The PhD spread to the UK from the US via Canada and was instituted at all British universities from 1917. The first (titled a DPhil) was awarded at the University of Oxford.

Following the MD, the next professional doctorate in the US, the Juris Doctor (JD), was established by the University of Chicago in 1902. However, it took a long time to be accepted, not replacing the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) until the 1960s, by which time the LLB was generally taken as a graduate degree. Notably, the JD and LLB curriculum were identical, with the degree being renamed as a doctorate, and it (like the MD) was not equivalent to the PhD, raising criticism that it was &quot;not a &#x27;true Doctorate. When professional doctorates were established in the UK in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they did not follow the US model. Still, they were set up as research degrees at the same level as PhDs but with some taught components and a professional focus for research work.

Now usually called higher doctorates in the United Kingdom, the older-style doctorates take much longer to complete since candidates must show themselves to be leading experts in their subjects. These doctorates are less common than the PhD in some countries and are often awarded &quot;honoris causa&quot;. The habilitation is still used for academic recruitment purposes in many countries within the EU. It involves either a long new thesis (a second book) or a portfolio of research publications. The habilitation (highest available degree) demonstrates independent and thorough research, experience in teaching and lecturing, and, more recently, the ability to generate supportive funding. The habilitation follows the research doctorate, and in Germany, it can be a requirement for appointment as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; or professor.

==Types==

Since the Middle Ages, the number and types of doctorates awarded by universities have proliferated throughout the world. Practice varies from one country to another. While a doctorate usually entitles a person to be addressed as &quot;doctor&quot;, the use of the title varies widely depending on the type and the associated occupation.

===Research doctorate===
Research doctorates are awarded in recognition of publishable academic research, at least in principle, in a peer-reviewed academic journal. The best-known research degree in the English-speaking world is the Doctor of Philosophy (abbreviated PhD or, at a small number of British universities, DPhil) awarded in many countries throughout the world. In the US, for instance, although the most typical research doctorate is the PhD, accounting for about 98% of the research doctorates awarded, there are more than 15 other names for research doctorates. Other research-oriented doctorates (some having a professional practice focus) include the Doctor of Education (EdD), the Doctor of Science (DSc or ScD),Doctor of Arts (DA), Doctor of Juridical Science (JSD or SJD), Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA), Doctor of Professional Studies/Professional Doctorate (ProfDoc or DProf), Doctor of Public Health (DrPH), Doctor of Social Science (DSSc or DSocSci), Doctor of Management (DM, DMan or DMgt), Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), Doctor of Engineering (DEng, DESc, DES or EngD) the German engineering doctorate &quot;Doktoringenieur&quot; (&quot;Dr.-Ing.&quot;), natural science doctorate &quot;Doctor rerum naturalium&quot; (&quot;Dr. rer. nat.&quot;), and economics and social science doctorate &quot;Doctor rerum politicarum&quot; (&quot;Dr. rer. pol.&quot;). The UK Doctor of Medicine (MD or MD (Res)) and Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) are research doctorates. The Doctor of Theology (ThD or DTh), Doctor of Practical Theology (DPT) and the Doctor of Sacred Theology (STD, or DSTh) are research doctorates in theology.

Criteria for research doctorates vary but typically require completion of a substantial body of original research, which may be presented as a single thesis or dissertation, or as a portfolio of shorter project reports (thesis by publication). The submitted dissertation is assessed by a committee of, typically, internal, and external examiners. It is then typically defended by the candidate during an oral examination (called &quot;viva (voce)&quot; in the UK and India) by the committee, which then awards the degree unconditionally, awards the degree conditionally (ranging from corrections in grammar to additional research), or denies the degree. Candidates may also be required to complete graduate-level courses in their field and study research methodology.

Criteria for admission to doctoral programs vary. Students may be admitted with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the US and the UK However, elsewhere, e.g. in Finland and many other European countries, a master&#x27;s degree is required. The time required to complete a research doctorate varies from three years, excluding undergraduate study, to six years or more.

===Licentiate===

Licentiate degrees vary widely in their meaning, and in a few countries are doctoral-level qualifications. Sweden awards the licentiate degree as a two-year qualification at the doctoral level and the doctoral degree (PhD) as a four-year qualification. Sweden originally abolished the Licentiate in 1969 but reintroduced it in response to demands from business. Finland also has a two-year doctoral level licentiate degree, similar to Sweden&#x27;s. Outside of Scandinavia, the licentiate is usually a lower-level qualification. In Belgium, the licentiate was the basic university degree prior to the Bologna Process and was equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. In France and other countries, it is the bachelor&#x27;s-level qualification in the Bologna process. In the Pontifical system, the Licentiate in Sacred Theology (STL) is equivalent to an advanced master&#x27;s degree, or the post-master&#x27;s coursework required in preparation for a doctorate (i.e. similar in level to the Swedish/Finnish licentiate degree). While other licences (such as the Licence in Canon Law) are at the level of master&#x27;s degrees.

===Higher doctorate and post-doctoral degrees ===

A higher tier of research doctorates may be awarded based on a formally submitted portfolio of published research of an exceptionally high standard. Examples include the Doctor of Science (DSc or ScD), Doctor of Divinity (DD), Doctor of Letters (DLitt or LittD), Doctor of Law or Laws (LLD), and Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) degrees found in the UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries, and the traditional doctorates in Scandinavia like the Doctor Medicinae (Dr. Med.).

The habilitation teaching qualification (&quot;facultas docendi&quot; or &quot;faculty to teach&quot;) under a university procedure with a thesis and an exam is commonly regarded as belonging to this category in Germany, Austria, France, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Poland, etc. The degree developed in Germany in the 19th century &quot;when holding a doctorate seemed no longer sufficient to guarantee a proficient transfer of knowledge to the next generation&quot;. In many federal states of Germany, the habilitation results in an award of a formal &quot;Dr. habil.&quot; degree or the holder of the degree may add &quot;habil.&quot; to their research doctorate such as &quot;Dr. phil. habil.&quot; or &quot;Dr. rer. nat. habil.&quot; In some European universities, especially in German-speaking countries, the degree is insufficient to have teaching duties without professor supervision (or teaching and supervising PhD students independently) without an additional teaching title such as Privatdozent. In Austria, the habilitation bestows the graduate with the &quot;facultas docendi&quot;, &quot;venia legendi.&quot; Since 2004, the honorary title of &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (before this, completing the habilitation resulted in appointment as a civil servant). In many Central and Eastern Europe countries, the degree gives &quot;venia legendi&quot;, Latin for &quot;the permission to lecture&quot;, or &quot;ius docendi&quot;, &quot;the right to teach&quot;, a specific academic subject at universities for a lifetime. The French academic system used to have a higher doctorate, called the &quot;state doctorate&quot; (&quot;doctorat d&#x27;État&quot;), but, in 1984, it was superseded by the habilitation (&quot;Habilitation à diriger des recherches&quot;, &quot;habilitation to supervise (doctoral and post-doctoral) research&quot;, abbreviated HDR) which is the prerequisite to supervise PhDs and to apply to Full Professorships. In many countries of the previous Soviet Union (USSR), for example the Russian Federation or Ukraine there is the higher doctorate (above the title of &quot;Candidate of Sciences&quot;/PhD) under the title &quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot;.

While this section has focused on earned qualifications conferred in virtue of published work or the equivalent, a higher doctorate may also be presented on an honorary basis by a university — at its own initiative or after a nomination — in recognition of public prestige, institutional service, philanthropy, or professional achievement. In a formal listing of qualifications, and often in other contexts, an honorary higher doctorate will be identified using language like &quot;DCL, &quot;honoris causa&quot;&quot;, &quot;HonLLD&quot;, or &quot;LittD &quot;h.c.&quot;&quot;.

===Professional doctorate===
Depending on the country, professional doctorates may also be research degrees at the same level as PhDs. The relationship between research and practice is considered important and professional degrees with little or no research content are typically aimed at professional performance. Many professional doctorates are named &quot;Doctor of [subject name] and abbreviated using the form &quot;D[subject abbreviation]&quot; or &quot;[subject abbreviation]D&quot;, or may use the more generic titles &quot;Professional Doctorate&quot;, abbreviated &quot;ProfDoc&quot; or &quot;DProf&quot;, &quot;Doctor of Professional Studies&quot; (DPS) or &quot;Doctor of Professional Practice&quot; (DPP).

In the US, professional doctorates (formally &quot;doctor&#x27;s degree – professional practice&quot; in government classifications) are defined by the US Department of Education&#x27;s National Center for Educational Statistics as degrees that require a minimum of six years of university-level study (including any pre-professional bachelor&#x27;s or associate degree) and meet the academic requirements for professional licensure in the discipline. The definition for a professional doctorate does not include a requirement for either a dissertation or study beyond master&#x27;s level, in contrast to the definition for research doctorates (&quot;doctor&#x27;s degree – research/scholarship&quot;). However, individual programs may have different requirements. There is also a category of &quot;doctor&#x27;s degree – other&quot; for doctorates that do not fall into either the &quot;professional practice&quot; or &quot;research/scholarship&quot; categories. All of these are considered doctoral degrees.

In contrast to the US, many countries reserve the term &quot;doctorate&quot; for research degrees. If, as in Canada and Australia, professional degrees bear the name &quot;Doctor of ...&quot;, etc., it is made clear that these are not doctorates. Examples of this include Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS), Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), and Juris Doctor (JD). Contrariwise, for example, research doctorates like Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), Doctor of Education (EdD) and Doctor of Social Science (DSS) qualify as full academic doctorates in Canada though they normally incorporate aspects of professional practice in addition to a full dissertation. In the Philippines, the University of the Philippines Open University offers a Doctor of Communication (DComm) professional doctorate.

All doctorates in the UK and Ireland are third cycle qualifications in the Bologna Process, comparable to US research doctorates. Although all doctorates are research degrees, professional doctorates normally include taught components, while the name PhD/DPhil is normally used for doctorates purely by thesis. Professional, practitioner, or practice-based doctorates such as the DClinPsy, MD, DHSc, EdD, DBA, EngD and DAg are full academic doctorates. They are at the same level as the PhD in the national qualifications frameworks; they are not first professional degrees but are &quot;often post-experience qualifications&quot; in which practice is considered important in the research context. In 2009 there were 308 professional doctorate programs in the UK, up from 109 in 1998, with the most popular being the EdD (38 institutions), DBA (33), EngD/DEng (22), MD/DM (21), and DClinPsy/DClinPsych/ClinPsyD (17). Similarly, in Australia, the term &quot;professional doctorate&quot; is sometimes applied to the &quot;Scientiae Juridicae Doctor&quot; (SJD), which, like the UK professional doctorates, is a research degree.

===Honorary doctorate===

When a university wishes to formally recognize an individual&#x27;s contributions to a particular field or philanthropic efforts, it may choose to grant a doctoral degree (&#x27;for the sake of the honor&#x27;), waiving the usual requirements for granting the degree. Some universities do not award honorary degrees, for example, Cornell University, the University of Virginia, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

==National variations==

===Argentina===
In Argentina the doctorate () is the highest academic degree. The intention is that candidates produce original contributions in their field knowledge within a frame of academic excellence. A dissertation or thesis is prepared under the supervision of a tutor or director. It is reviewed by a Doctoral Committee composed of examiners external to the program and at least one examiner external to the institution. The degree is conferred after a successful dissertation defence. In 2006, there were approximately 2,151 postgraduate careers in the country, of which 14% were doctoral degrees. Doctoral programs in Argentina are overseen by the , an agency in Argentina&#x27;s Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.

===Australia===
The Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) categorizes tertiary qualifications into ten levels that are numbered from one to ten in ascending order of complexity and depth. Of these qualification levels, six are for higher education qualifications and are numbered from five to ten. Doctoral degrees occupy the highest of these levels: level ten. All doctoral degrees involve research and this is a defining characteristic of them. There are three categories of doctoral degrees recognized by the AQF: research doctorates, professional doctorates and higher doctorates.

Research doctorates and professional doctorates are both completed as part of a programme of study and supervised research. Both have entry requirements of the student having a supervisor that has agreed to supervise their research, along with the student possessing an honours degree with upper second-class honours or better or a master&#x27;s degree with a substantial research component. Research doctorates are typically titled Doctor of Philosophy and they are awarded on the basis of an original and significant contribution to knowledge. Professional doctorates are typically titled Doctor of (field of study) and they are awarded on the basis of an original and significant contribution to professional practice.

Higher doctorates are typically titled similarly to professional doctorates and are awarded based on a submitted portfolio of research that follows a consistent theme and is internationally recognized as an original and substantive contribution to knowledge beyond that required for the awarding of a research doctorate. Typically, to be eligible to be awarded a higher doctorate a student must have completed a research doctorate at least seven to ten years prior to submitting the research portfolio used to award them a higher doctorate.

===Brazil===
Doctoral candidates are normally required to have a master&#x27;s degree in a related field. Exceptions are based on their individual academic merit. A second and a third foreign language are other common requirements, although the requirements regarding proficiency commonly are not strict. The admissions process varies by institution. Some require candidates to take tests while others base admissions on a research proposal application and interview only. In both instances however, a faculty member must agree prior to admission to supervise the applicant.

Requirements usually include satisfactory performance in advanced graduate courses, passing an oral qualifying exam and submitting a thesis that must represent an original and relevant contribution to existing knowledge. The thesis is examined in a final public oral exam administered by at least five faculty members, two of whom must be external. After completion, which normally consumes 4 years, the candidate is commonly awarded the degree of &quot;Doutor&quot; (Doctor) followed by the main area of specialization, e.g. &quot;Doutor em Direito&quot; (Doctor of Laws), &quot;Doutor em Ciências da Computação&quot; (Doctor of Computer Sciences), &quot;Doutor em Filosofia&quot; (Doctor of Philosophy), &quot;Doutor em Economia&quot; (Doctor of Economics), &quot;Doutor em Engenharia&quot; (Doctor of Engineering) or &quot;Doutor em Medicina&quot; (Doctor of Medicine). The generic title of &quot;Doutor em Ciências&quot; (Doctor of Sciences) is normally used to refer collectively to doctorates in the natural sciences (i.e. Physics, Chemistry, Biological and Life Sciences, etc.)

All graduate programs in Brazilian public universities are tuition-free (mandated by the Brazilian constitution). Some graduate students are additionally supported by institutional scholarships granted by federal government agencies like CNPq (&quot;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico&quot;) and CAPES (&quot;Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento do Pessoal de Ensino Superior&quot;). Personal scholarships are provided by the various FAP&#x27;s (&quot;Fundações de Amparo à Pesquisa&quot;) at the state level, especially FAPESP in the state of São Paulo, FAPERJ in the state of Rio de Janeiro and FAPEMIG in the state of Minas Gerais. Competition for graduate financial aid is intense and most scholarships support at most 2 years of Master&#x27;s studies and 4 years of doctoral studies. The normal monthly stipend for doctoral students in Brazil is between US$500 and $1000.

A degree of &quot;Doutor&quot; usually enables an individual to apply for a junior faculty position equivalent to a US assistant professor. Progression to full professorship, known as &quot;Professor Titular&quot; requires that the candidate be successful in a competitive public exam and normally takes additional years. In the federal university system, doctors who are admitted as junior faculty members may progress (usually by seniority) to the rank of associate professor, then become eligible to take the competitive exam for vacant full professorships. In São Paulo state universities, associate professorships and subsequent eligibility to apply for a full professorship are conditioned on the qualification of and requires, in addition to a doctorate, a second thesis or cumulative portfolio of peer-reviewed publications, a public lecture before a panel of experts (including external members from other universities), and a written exam.

In recent years some initiatives as jointly supervised doctorates (e.g. &quot;cotutelles&quot;) have become increasingly common in the country, as part of the country&#x27;s efforts to open its universities to international students.

===Denmark===
Denmark offers two types of &quot;doctorate&quot;-like degrees:
#A three-year ph.d. degree program, which replaced the equivalent &quot;licentiat&quot; in 1992, and does not grant the holder the right to the title &quot;dr.&quot; or &quot;doktor&quot;. At the same time, a minor, two-year research training program, leading to a title of &quot;magister&quot;, was phased out to meet the international standards of the Bologna Process.
#A &#x27;full&#x27; doctor&#x27;s degree (e.g. &quot;dr.phil.&quot;, &quot;Doctor Philosophiae&quot;, for humanistic and STEM subjects) – the higher doctorate – introduced in 1479. The second part of the title communicates the field of study – e.g. &quot;dr.scient&quot; (in the sciences), &quot;dr.jur&quot; (in law), &quot;dr.theol&quot; (in theology).

For the ph.d. degree, the candidates (ph.d. students or fellows) – who are required to have a master&#x27;s degree – enroll at a ph.d. school at a university and participate in a research training program, at the end of which they each submit a thesis and defend it orally at a formal disputation. In the disputation, the candidates defend their theses against three official opponents, and may take opponents or questions from those present in the auditorium &quot;(ex auditorio)&quot;.

For the higher doctorate, the candidate (referred to as &quot;præses&quot;) is required to submit a thesis of major scientific significance, and to proceed to defend it orally against two official opponents, as well as against any and all opponents from the auditorium (&quot;ex auditorio&quot;) – no matter how long the proceedings take. The official opponents are required to be full professors. The candidate is required to have a master&#x27;s degree, but not necessarily a ph.d.

The ph.d. was introduced as a separate title from the higher doctorate in 1992 as part of the transition to a new degree structure, since the changes in the degree system would otherwise leave a significant amount of academics without immediately recognizable qualifications in international settings. The original vision was purported to be to phase out the higher doctorate in favor of the ph.d. (or merge the two), but so far, there are no signs of this happening. Many Danish academics with permanent positions wrote ph.d. dissertations in the 90s when the system was new, since at that time, a ph.d. degree or equivalent qualifications began to be required for certain academic positions in Denmark. Until the late 20th century, the higher doctorate was a condition for attaining full professorship; it is no longer required &quot;per se&quot; for any positions, but is considered amply equivalent to the ph.d. when applying for academic positions.

===Egypt===
In Egypt, the highest degree doctorate is awarded by Al-Azhar University est. 970, which grants ( العالمية Ālimiyya\ Habilitation).

The Medical doctorate (abbreviated as M.D.) is equivalent to the Ph.D. degree. To earn an M.D. in a science specialty, one must have a master&#x27;s degree (M.Sc.) (or two diplomas before the introduction of M.Sc. degree in Egypt) before applying. The M.D. degree involves courses in the field and defending a dissertation. It takes on average three to five years.

Many postgraduate medical and surgical specialties students earn a doctorate. After finishing a 6-year medical school and one-year internship (house officer), physicians and surgeons earn the M.B. B.Ch. degree, which is equivalent to a US MD degree. They can then apply to earn a master&#x27;s degree or a speciality diploma, then an MD degree in a specialty.

The Egyptian M.D. degree is written using the name of one&#x27;s specialty. For example, M.D. (Geriatrics) means a doctorate in Geriatrics, which is equivalent to a Ph.D. in Geriatrics.

===Finland===
The Finnish requirement for the entrance into doctoral studies is a master&#x27;s degree or equivalent. All universities have the right to award doctorates. The &quot;ammattikorkeakoulu&quot; institutes (institutes of higher vocational education that are not universities but often called &quot;Universities of Applied Sciences&quot; in English) do not award doctoral or other academic degrees. The student must:

* Demonstrate understanding of their field and its meaning, while preparing to use scientific or scholarly study in their field, creating new knowledge.
* Obtain a good understanding of development, basic problems and research methods
* Obtain such understanding of the general theory of science and letters and such knowledge of neighbouring research fields that they are able to follow the development of these fields.

The way to show that these general requirements have been met is:

* Complete graduate coursework.
* Demonstrate critical and independent thought
* Prepare and publicly defend a dissertation (a monograph or a compilation thesis of peer-reviewed articles). In fine arts, the dissertation may be substituted by works and/or performances as accepted by the faculty.

Entrance to a doctoral program is available only for holders of a master&#x27;s degree; there is no honors procedure for recruiting Bachelors. Entrance is not as controlled as in undergraduate studies, where a strict numerus clausus is applied. Usually, a prospective student discusses their plans with a professor. If the professor agrees to accept the student, the student applies for admission. The professor may recruit students to their group. Formal acceptance does not imply funding. The student must obtain funding either by working in a research unit or through private scholarships. Funding is more available for natural and engineering sciences than in letters. Sometimes, normal work and research activity are combined.

Prior to introduction of the Bologna process, Finland required at least 42 credit weeks (1,800 hours) of formal coursework. The requirement was removed in 2005, leaving the decision to individual universities, which may delegate the authority to faculties or individual professors. In Engineering and Science, required coursework varies between 40 and 70 ECTS.

The duration of graduate studies varies. It is possible to graduate three years after the master&#x27;s degree, while much longer periods are not uncommon. The study ends with a dissertation, which must present substantial new scientific/scholarly knowledge. The dissertation can either be a monograph or it an edited collection of 3 to 7 journal articles. Students unable or unwilling to write a dissertation may qualify for a licentiate degree by completing the coursework requirement and writing a shorter thesis, usually summarizing one year of research.

When the dissertation is ready, the faculty names two expert pre-examiners with doctoral degrees from the outside the university. During the pre-examination process, the student may receive comments on the work and respond with modifications. After the pre-examiners approve, the doctoral candidate applies the faculty for permission to print the thesis. When granting this permission, the faculty names the &quot;opponent&quot; for the thesis defence, who must also be an outside expert, with at least a doctorate. In all Finnish universities, long tradition requires that the printed dissertation hang on a cord by a public university noticeboard for at least ten days prior to for the dissertation defence.

The doctoral dissertation takes place in public. The opponent and the candidate conduct a formal debate, usually wearing white tie, under the supervision of the thesis supervisor. Family, friends, colleagues and the members of the research community customarily attend the defence. After a formal entrance, the candidate begins with an approximately 20-minute popular lecture (&quot;lectio praecursoria&quot;), that is meant to introduce laymen to the thesis topic. The opponent follows with a short talk on the topic, after which the pair critically discuss the dissertation. The proceedings take two to three hours. At the end the opponent presents their final statement and reveals whether he/she will recommend that the faculty accept it. Any member of the public then has an opportunity to raise questions, although this is rare. Immediately after the defence, the supervisor, the opponent and the candidate drink coffee with the public. Usually, the attendees of the defence are given the printed dissertation. In the evening, the passed candidate hosts a dinner () in honour of the opponent. Usually, the candidate invites their family, colleagues and collaborators.

Doctoral graduates are often Doctors of Philosophy (&quot;filosofian tohtori&quot;), but many fields retain their traditional titles: Doctor of Medicine (&quot;lääketieteen tohtori&quot;), Doctor of Science in technology (&quot;tekniikan tohtori&quot;), Doctor of Science in arts (Art and Design), etc.

The doctorate is a formal requirement for a docenture or professor&#x27;s position, although these in practice require postdoctoral research and further experience. Exceptions may be granted by the university governing board, but this is uncommon, and usually due to other work and expertise considered equivalent.

===France===
;History
Before 1984 three research doctorates existed in France: the State doctorate (&quot;doctorat d&#x27;État&quot;, &quot;DrE&quot;, the old doctorate introduced in 1808), the third cycle doctorate (&quot;Doctorat de troisième cycle&quot;, also called doctorate of specialty, &quot;Doctorat de spécialité&quot;, created in 1954 and shorter than the State doctorate) and the diploma of doctor-engineer (&quot;diplôme de docteur-ingénieur&quot; created in 1923), for technical research.

During the first half of the 20th century, following the submission of two theses (primary thesis, &quot;thèse principale&quot;, and secondary thesis, &quot;thèse complémentaire&quot;) to the Faculty of Letters (in France, &quot;letters&quot; is equivalent to &quot;humanities&quot;) at the University of Paris, the doctoral candidate was awarded the &quot;Doctorat ès lettres&quot;. There was also the less prestigious &quot;university doctorate&quot; &quot;Doctorat d&#x27;université&quot; which could be received for the submission of a single thesis.

In the 1950s, the &quot;Doctorat ès lettres&quot; was renamed to &quot;Doctorat d&#x27;État&quot;. In 1954 (for the sciences) and 1958 (for letters and human sciences), the less demanding &quot;Doctorat de troisième cycle&quot; degree was created on the model of the American Ph.D. with the purpose to lessen what had become an increasingly long period of time between the typical students&#x27; completion of their Diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures, roughly equivalent to a Master of Arts, and their &quot;Doctorat d&#x27;État&quot;.

After 1984, only one type of doctoral degree remained: the &quot;doctorate&quot; (&quot;Doctorat&quot;). A special diploma was created called the &quot;Habilitation to Supervise Research&quot; (also translated as &quot;accreditation to supervise research&quot;; &quot;Habilitation à diriger des recherches&quot;), a professional qualification to supervise doctoral work. (This diploma is similar in spirit to the older State doctorate, and the requirements for obtaining it are similar to those necessary to obtain tenure in other systems.) Before only professors or senior full researchers of similar rank were normally authorized to supervise a doctoral candidate&#x27;s work. Now habilitation is a prerequisite to the title of professor in university (&quot;Professeur des universités&quot;) and to the title of Research Director (&quot;Directeur de recherche&quot;) in national public research agency such as CNRS, INRIA, or INRAE.

;Admission
Today, the doctorate (&quot;doctorat&quot;) is a research-only degree. It is a national degree and its requirements are fixed by the minister of higher education and research. Only public institutions award the doctorate. It can be awarded in any field of study. The master&#x27;s degree is a prerequisite. The normal duration is three years. The writing of a comprehensive thesis constitutes the bulk of the doctoral work. While the length of the thesis varies according to the discipline, it is rarely less than 150 pages, and often substantially more. Some 15,000 new doctoral matriculations occur every year and ≈10,000 doctorates are awarded.

Doctoral candidates can apply for a three-year fellowship. The most well known is the &quot;Contrat Doctoral&quot; (4,000 granted every year with a gross salary of 1758 euros per month ).

Since 2002 candidates follow in-service training, but there is no written examination for the doctorate. The candidate has to write a thesis that is read by two external reviewers. The head of the institution decides whether the candidate can defend the thesis, after considering the external reviews. The jury members are designated by the head of the institution. The candidate&#x27;s supervisor and the external reviewers are generally jury members. The maximum number of jury members is 8. The defense generally lasts 45 minutes in scientific fields, followed by 1 – hours of questions from the jury or other doctors present. The defense and questions are public. The jury then deliberates in private and then declares the candidate admitted or &quot;postponed&quot;. The latter is rare. New regulations were set in 2016 and do not award distinctions.

The title of doctor (&quot;docteur&quot;) can also be used by medical and pharmaceutical practitioners who hold a doctor&#x27;s State diploma (&quot;diplôme d&#x27;État de docteur&quot;, distinct from the &quot;doctorat d&#x27;État&quot; mentioned above). The diploma is a first-degree.

A guidelines with good practices and legal analysis has been published in 2018 by Association nationale des docteurs (ANDès) &amp; Confédération des Jeunes Chercheurs (CJC) with funding of French Ministry of research.

===Germany===
Doctoral degrees in Germany are research doctorates and are awarded by a process called . The concept of a US-style professional doctorate as an entry-level professional qualification does not exist. Most doctorates are awarded with specific Latin designations for the field of research (except for engineering, where the designation is German), instead of a general name for all fields (such as the Ph.D.). The most important degrees are:
* &quot;Dr. theol.&quot; (&quot;theologiae&quot;; theology);
* &quot;Dr. phil.&quot; (&quot;philosophiae&quot;; humanities such as philosophy, philology, history, and social sciences such as sociology, political science, or psychology as well);
* &quot;Dr. rer. nat.&quot; (&quot;rerum naturalium&quot;; natural and formal sciences, i.e. physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer science and information technology, or psychology);
* &quot;Dr. iur.&quot; (&quot;iuris&quot;; law);
* &quot;Dr. med.&quot; (&quot;medicinae&quot;; medicine);
* &quot;Dr. med. dent.&quot; (&quot;medicinae dentariae&quot;; dentistry);
* &quot;Dr. med. vet.&quot; (&quot;medicinae veterinariae&quot;; veterinary medicine);
* &quot;Dr.-Ing.&quot; (engineering);
* &quot;Dr. oec.&quot; (&quot;oeconomiae&quot;; economics);
* &quot;Dr. rer. pol.&quot; (&quot;rerum politicarum&quot;; economics, business administration, political science).

In medicine, &quot;doctoral&quot; dissertations are often written alongside undergraduate study therefore, European Research Council decided in 2010 that such Dr. med. degrees do not meet the international standards of a Ph.D. research degree. The duration of the doctorate depends on the field: a doctorate in medicine may take less than a full-time year to complete; those in other fields, two to six years.

Over fifty doctoral designations exist, many of them rare or no longer in use. As a title, the degree is commonly written in front of the name in abbreviated form, e.g., &quot;Dr. rer. nat. Max Mustermann&quot; or &quot;Dr. Max Mustermann&quot;, dropping the designation entirely. However, leaving out the designation is only allowed when the doctorate degree is not an honorary doctorate, which must be indicated by &quot;Dr. h.c.&quot; (from Latin honoris causa). Although the honorific does not become part of the name, holders can demand that the title appear in official documents. The title is not mandatory. The honorific is commonly used in formal letters. For holders of other titles, only the highest title is mentioned. Multiple holders of doctorate degrees can be addressed as &quot;Dres.&quot; (from Latin &quot;doctores&quot;). Professional doctorates obtained in other countries, not requiring a thesis or not being third cycle qualifications under the Bologna process, can only be used postnominally, e.g., &quot;Max Mustermann, MD&quot;, and do not allow the use of the title Dr. In contrast to English, in which a person&#x27;s name is preceded by at most one title (except in very ceremonious usage), the formal German mode of address permits several titles in addition to &quot;Herr&quot; or &quot;Frau&quot; (which, unlike &quot;Mr&quot; or &quot;Ms&quot;, is not considered a title at all, but an &quot;Anrede&quot; or &quot;address&quot;), including repetitions in the case of multiple degrees, as in &quot;Frau Prof. Dr. Dr. Schmidt&quot;, for a person who would be addressed as &quot;Prof. Schmidt&quot; in English.

In the German university system it is common to write two doctoral theses, the inaugural thesis (Inauguraldissertation), completing a course of study, and the habilitation thesis (&quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot;), which opens the road to a professorship. Upon completion of the habilitation thesis, a &quot;Habilitation&quot; is awarded, which is indicated by appending &quot;habil.&quot; (&quot;habilitata/habilitatus&quot;) to the doctorate, e.g., &quot;Dr. rer. nat. habil. Max Mustermann&quot;. It is considered as an additional academic qualification rather than an academic degree formally. It qualifies the owner to teach at German universities (&quot;facultas docendi&quot;). The holder of a &quot;Habilitation&quot; receives the authorization to teach a certain subject (&quot;venia legendi&quot;). This has been the traditional prerequisite for attaining &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (PD) and employment as a full university professor. With the introduction of &quot;Juniorprofessuren&quot;—around 2005—as an alternative track towards becoming a professor at universities (with tenure), &quot;Habilitation&quot; is no longer the only university career track.

===India===
In India, doctorates are offered by universities. Entry requirements include master&#x27;s degree. Some universities consider undergraduate degrees in professional areas such as engineering, medicine or law as qualifications for pursuing doctorate level degrees. Entrance examinations are held for almost all programs. In most universities, coursework duration and thesis is 3–7 years. The most common doctoral degree is Ph.D.

===Italy===
Until the introduction of the &quot;dottorato di ricerca&quot; in the mid-1980s, the &quot;laurea&quot; generally constituted the highest academic degree obtainable in Italy. The first institution in Italy to create a doctoral program was Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in 1927 under the historic name &quot;Diploma di Perfezionamento&quot;. Further, the &quot;dottorato di ricerca&quot; was introduced by law and presidential decree in 1980, in a reform of academic teaching, training and experimentation in organisation and teaching methods.

Italy uses a three-level degree system following the Bologna Process. The first-level degree, called a &quot;laurea&quot; (&quot;Bachelor&#x27;s degree&quot;), requires three years and a short thesis. The second-level degree, called a &quot;laurea magistrale&quot; (&quot;Master&#x27;s degree&quot;), is obtained after two additional years, specializing in a branch of the field. This degree requires more advanced thesis work, usually involving academic research or an internship. The final degree is called a &quot;dottorato di ricerca&quot; (&quot;Ph.D.&quot;) and is obtained after three years of academic research on the subject and a thesis.

Alternatively, after obtaining the &quot;laurea&quot; or the &quot;laurea magistrale&quot;, one can complete a &quot;Master&#x27;s&quot; (first-level Master&#x27;s after the &quot;laurea&quot;; second-level Master&#x27;s after the &quot;laurea magistrale&quot;) of one or two years, usually including an internship. An Italian &quot;Master&#x27;s&quot; is not the same as a master&#x27;s degree; it is intended to be more focused on professional training and practical experience.

Regardless of the field of study, the title for Bachelors Graduate students is &quot;Dottore/Dottoressa&quot; (abbrev. &quot;Dott.&quot;/&quot;Dott.ssa&quot;, or as &quot;Dr.&quot;), not to be confused with the title for the Ph.D., which is instead &quot;Dottore/Dottoressa di Ricerca&quot;. A &quot;laurea magistrale&quot; grants instead the title of &quot;Dottore/Dottoressa magistrale&quot;. Graduates in the fields of Education, Art and Music are also called &quot;Dr. Prof.&quot; (or simply &quot;Professore&quot;) or &quot;Maestro&quot;. Many professional titles, such as &quot;ingegnere&quot; (engineer) are awarded only upon passing a post-graduation examination (&quot;esame di stato&quot;), and registration in the relevant professional association.

The Superior Graduate Schools in Italy (Italian: &quot;Scuola Superiore Universitaria&quot;), also called &quot;Schools of Excellence&quot; (Italian: &quot;Scuole di Eccellenza&quot;) such as Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa and Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies keep their historical &quot;Diploma di Perfezionamento&quot; title by law and MIUR Decree.

===Japan===

====Dissertation-only====
Until the 1990s, most natural science and engineering doctorates in Japan were earned by industrial researchers in Japanese companies. These degrees were awarded by the employees&#x27; former university, usually after years of research in industrial laboratories. The only requirement is submission of a dissertation, along with articles published in well-known journals. This program is called . It produced the majority of engineering doctoral degrees from national universities. University-based doctoral programs called , are gradually replacing these degrees. By 1994, more doctoral engineering degrees were earned for research within university laboratories (53%) than industrial research laboratories (47%). Since 1978, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) has provided tutorial and financial support for promising researchers in Asia and Africa. The program is called JSPS RONPAKU.

====Professional degree====
The only professional doctorate in Japan is the Juris Doctor, known as &quot;Hōmu Hakushi&quot; (法務博士) The program generally lasts two or three years. This curriculum is professionally oriented, but unlike in the US the program does not provide education sufficient for a law license. All candidates for a bar license must pass the bar exam (&quot;Shihou shiken&quot;), attend the Legal Training and Research Institute and pass the practical exam (&quot;Nikai Shiken&quot; or &quot;Shihou Shushusei koushi&quot;).

===Netherlands and Flanders===
The traditional academic system of the Netherlands provided basic academic diploma: &quot;propaedeuse&quot; and three academic degrees: &quot;kandidaat&quot; (the lowest degree), depending on gender &quot;doctorandus&quot; or &quot;doctoranda&quot; (drs.) (with equivalent degrees in engineering – ir. and law – mr.) and &quot;doctor&quot; (dr.). After successful completion of the first year of university, the student was awarded the propaedeutic diploma (not a degree). In some fields, this diploma was abolished in the 1980s. In physics and mathematics, the student could directly obtain a &quot;kandidaats (candidate)&quot; diploma in two years. The candidate diploma was all but abolished by 1989. It used to be attained after completion of the majority of courses of the academic study (usually after completion of course requirements of the third year in the program), after which the student was allowed to begin work on their doctorandus thesis. The successful completion of this thesis conveyed the &quot;doctoranda/us&quot; title, implying that the student&#x27;s initial studies were finished. In addition to these &#x27;general&#x27; degrees, specific titles equivalent to the &quot;doctorandus&quot; degree were awarded for law: &quot;meester&quot; (master) (mr.), and for engineering: &quot;ingenieur&quot; (engineer)(ir.). Following the Bologna protocol the Dutch adopted the Anglo-Saxon system of academic degrees. The old candidate&#x27;s degree was revived to become the bachelor&#x27;s degree and the doctorandus&#x27; (mr and ir degree) were replaced by master&#x27;s degrees.

Students can only enroll in a doctorate system after completing a research university level master&#x27;s degree; although dispensation can be granted on a case-by-case basis after scrutiny of the individual&#x27;s portfolio. The most common way to conduct doctoral studies is to work as &quot;promovendus&quot;/&quot;assistent in opleiding&quot; (aio)/&quot;onderzoeker in opleiding&quot; (oio) (research assistant with additional courses and supervision), perform extensive research and write a dissertation consisting of published articles (over a period of four or more years). Research can also be conducted without official research assistant status, for example through a business-sponsored research laboratory.

The doctor&#x27;s title is the highest academic title in the Netherlands and Flanders. In research doctorates the degree is always Ph.D. or dr. with no distinction between disciplines, and can only be granted by research universities.

====Netherlands====
Every Ph.D. thesis has to be promoted by research university staff member holding ius promovendi (the right to promote). In the Netherlands all full professors have ius promovendi, as well as other academic staff granted this right on individual basis by the board of their university (almost always senior associate professors). The promotor has the role of principal advisor and determines whether the thesis quality suffices and can be submitted to the examining committee. The examining committee is appointed by the academic board of the university based on recommendation of the promotor and consists of experts in the field. The examining committee reviews the thesis manuscript and has to approve or fail the thesis. Failures at this stage are rare because promotors generally not submit work they deem inadequate to the examining committee, supervisors and promotor lose prestige among their colleagues should they allow a substandard thesis to be submitted.

After examining committee approval, the candidate publishes the thesis (generally more than 100 copies) and sends it to the examining committee, colleagues, friends and family with an invitation to the public defence. Additional copies are kept in the university library and the Royal Library of the Netherlands.

The degree is awarded in a formal, public, defence session, in which the thesis is defended against critical questions of the &quot;opposition&quot; (the examining committee). Specific formalities differ between universities, for example whether a public presentation is given, either before or during the session, specific phrasing in the procedure, and dress code. In most protocols, candidates can be supported by paranymphs, a largely ceremonial role, but they are formally allowed to take over the defence on behalf of the candidate. Doctoral candidates The actual defence lasts exactly the assigned time slot (45 minutes to 1 hour exactly depending on the university) after which the defence is suspended by the bedel who stops the examination, frequently mid sentence. Failure during this session is possible, but extremely rare. After formal approval of the thesis and the defence by the examining committee in a closed discussion, the session is resumed and the promotor grants the degree and hands over the diploma to the candidate, and usually congratulates the candidate and gives a personal speech praising the work of the &quot;young doctor&quot; (laudatio), before the session is formally closed.

Dutch doctors may use PhD behind their name instead of the uncapitalized dr. before their name. Those who obtained a degree in a foreign country can only use one of the Dutch title dr. if their grade is approved as equivalent by the &quot;Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs&quot; though according to the opportunity principle, little effort is spent in identifying such fraud.

Those who have multiple doctor (dr.) titles may use the title dr.mult. Those who have received honoris causa doctorates may use dr.h.c. before their own name.

The Dutch universities of technology (Eindhoven University of Technology, Delft University of Technology, University of Twente, and Wageningen University) also award a 2-year (industry oriented) Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng), renamed EngD from September 2022 onwards, which does not grant the right to use the dr. title abbreviation. In 2023, a pilot started at universities of applied sciences with a professional doctoral programme, in which the focus is on applying knowledge to improve or solve professional processes or products.

====Flanders====
In Belgium&#x27;s Flemish Community the doctorandus title was only used by those who actually started their doctoral work. Doctorandus is still used as a synonym for a Ph.D. student. The &quot;licentiaat&quot; (licensee) title was in use for a regular graduate until the Bologna reform changed the licentiaat degree to the master&#x27;s degree (the Bologna reform abolished the two-year kandidaat degree and introduced a three-year academic bachelor&#x27;s degree instead).
===Poland===
In Poland, an academic degree of &#x27;doctor&#x27; is awarded in sciences and arts upon an examination and defence of a doctoral dissertation. As Poland is a signatory to the Bologna Process, doctoral studies are a third cycle of studies following the bachelor&#x27;s () and master&#x27;s () degrees or their equivalents. Doctoral student is known as (masculine form) or (feminine form). Doctorate is awarded within specified brach and discipline of science or art by university or research institute accredited by the minister responsible for higher education. The title is abbreviated to in nominative case.

Doctors may further go a habilitation process.

===Russia===
Introduced in 1819 in the Russian Empire, the academic title &quot;Doctor of the Sciences&quot; () marks the highest academic level achievable by a formal process.

The title was abolished with the end of the Empire in 1917 and revived by the USSR in 1934 along with a new (lower) complementary degree of a &quot;Candidate [Doctor] of the Sciences&quot;&#x27; (). This system is used since with minor adjustments.

The &quot;Candidate of the Sciences&quot; title is usually seen as roughly equivalent to the research doctorates in Western countries while the &quot;Doctor of the Sciences&quot; title is relatively rare and retains its exclusivity. Most &quot;Candidates&quot; never reach the &quot;Doctor of the Sciences&quot; title.

Similar title systems were adopted by many of the Soviet bloc countries.

===Spain===

Doctoral degrees are regulated by Royal Decree (R.D. 778/1998), (in Spanish). They are granted by the university on behalf of the king. Its diploma has the force of a public document. The Ministry of Science keeps a national registry of theses called TESEO. According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), fewer than 5% of M.Sc. degree holders are admitted to Ph.D. programmes.

All doctoral programs are research-oriented. A minimum of 4 years of study is required, divided into 2 stages:

* A 2-year (or longer) period of studies concludes with a public dissertation presented to a panel of 3 Professors. Upon approval from the university, the candidate receives a (part qualified doctor, equivalent to M.Sc.). From 2008 it is possible to substitute the former diploma by a recognized master program.
* A 2-year (or longer) research period includes extensions for up to 10 years. The student must present a thesis describing a discovery or original contribution. If approved by their thesis director, the study is presented to a panel of 5 distinguished scholars. Any Doctor attending the public defense is allowed to challenge the candidate with questions. If approved, the candidate receives the doctorate. Four marks used to be granted: Unsatisfactory (), Pass (), Remarkable (), &quot;Cum laude&quot; (), and &quot;Summa cum laude&quot; (). Those Doctors granted their degree &quot;Summa Cum Laude&quot; were allowed to apply for an &quot;Extraordinary Award&quot;.

Since September 2012 and regulated by Royal Decree (R.D. 99/2011) (in Spanish), three marks can be granted: Unsatisfactory (), Pass () and &quot;Cum laude&quot; () as maximum mark. In the public defense the doctor is notified if the thesis has passed or not passed. The mark is awarded after the public defense as the result of a private, anonymous vote. Votes are verified by the university. A unanimous vote of the reviewers nominates Doctors granted for an &quot;Extraordinary Award&quot; ().

In the same Royal Decree the initial 3-year study period was replaced by a Research master&#x27;s degree (one or two years; Professional master&#x27;s degrees do not grant direct access to Ph.D. Programs) that concludes with a public dissertation called or . An approved project earns a master&#x27;s degree that grants access to a Ph.D. program and initiates the period of research.

A doctorate is required in order to teach at the university. Some universities offer an online Ph.D. model.

Only Ph.D. holders, Grandees and Dukes can sit and cover their heads in the presence of the King.

From 1857, Complutense University was the only one in Spain authorised to confer the doctorate. This law remained in effect until 1954, when the University of Salamanca joined in commemoration of its septcentenary. In 1970, the right was extended to all Spanish universities.

All doctorate holders are reciprocally recognised as equivalent in Germany and Spain (according to the &quot;Bonn Agreement of November 14, 1994&quot;).

===United Kingdom===

====History of the UK doctorate====

The doctorate has long existed in the UK as, originally, the second degree in divinity, law, medicine and music. But it was not until the late 19th century that the research doctorate, now known as the higher doctorate, was introduced. The first higher doctorate was the Doctor of Science at Durham University, introduced in 1882. This was soon followed by other universities, including the University of Cambridge establishing its ScD in the same year, the University of London transforming its DSc from an advanced study course to a research degree in 1885, and the University of Oxford establishing its Doctor of Letters (DLitt) in 1900.

The PhD was adopted in the UK following a joint decision in 1917 by British universities, although it took much longer for it to become established. Oxford became the first university to institute the new degree, although naming it the DPhil. The PhD was often distinguished from the earlier higher doctorates by distinctive academic dress. At Cambridge, for example, PhDs wear a master&#x27;s gown with scarlet facings rather than the full scarlet gown of the higher doctors, while the University of Wales gave PhDs crimson gowns rather than scarlet. Professional doctorates were introduced in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s. The earliest professional doctorates were in the social sciences, including the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), Doctor of Education (EdD) and Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy).

====British doctorates today====
Today, except for those awarded &quot;honoris causa&quot; (honorary degrees), all doctorates granted by British universities are research doctorates, in that their main (and in many cases only) component is the submission of an extensive and substantial thesis or portfolio of original research, examined by an expert panel appointed by the university. UK doctorates are categorised as:
;Junior doctorates
:# &quot;Subject specialist doctorates&quot; – normally PhD/DPhil; the most common form of doctorate
:#* &quot;Integrated subject specialist doctorates&quot; – integrated PhDs including teaching at master&#x27;s level 
:# &quot;Doctorates by publication&quot; – PhD by Published Works; only awarded infrequently
:# &quot;Professional / practice-based / practitioner doctorates&quot; – e.g. EdD, ProfDoc/DProf, EngD, etc.; usually include taught elements and have an orientation that combines professional and academic aspects
;Higher doctorates: e.g. DD, LLD, DSc, DLitt; higher level than junior doctorates, usually awarded either for a substantial body of work over an extended period or as honorary degrees.

The Quality Assurance Agency states in the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies (which covers junior doctorates but not higher doctorates) that:
In the UK, the (junior) doctorate is a qualification awarded at FHEQ level 8/level 12 of the FQHEIS on the national qualifications frameworks. The higher doctorates are stated to be &quot;A higher level of award&quot;, which is not covered by the qualifications frameworks.

====Subject specialist doctorates====

These are the most common doctorates in the UK and are normally awarded as PhDs. While the master/apprentice model was traditionally used for British PhDs, since 2003 courses have become more structured, with students taking courses in research skills and receiving training for professional and personal development. However, the assessment of the PhD remains based on the production of a thesis or equivalent and its defence at a &quot;viva voce&quot; oral examination, normally held in front of at least two examiners, one internal and one external. Access to PhDs normally requires an upper second class or first class bachelor&#x27;s degree, or a master&#x27;s degree. Courses normally last three years, although it is common for students to be initially registered for MPhil degrees and then formally transferred onto the PhD after a year or two. Students who are not considered likely to complete a PhD may be offered the opportunity to complete an MPhil instead.

Integrated doctorates, originally known as &#x27;New Route PhDs&#x27;, were introduced from 2000 onwards. These integrate teaching at master&#x27;s level during the first one or two years of the degree, either alongside research or as a preliminary to starting research. These courses usually offer a master&#x27;s-level exit degree after the taught courses are completed. While passing the taught elements is often required, examination of the final doctorate is still by thesis (or equivalent) alone. The duration of integrated doctorates is a minimum of four years, with three years spent on the research component.

In 2013, Research Councils UK issued a &#x27;Statement of Expectations for Postgraduate Training&#x27;, which lays out the expectations for training in PhDs funded by the research councils. In the latest version (2016), issued together with Cancer Research UK, the Wellcome Trust and the British Heart Foundation, these include the provision of careers advice, in-depth advanced training in the subject area, provision of transferable skills, training in experimental design and statistics, training in good research conduct, and training for compliance with legal, ethical and professional frameworks. The statement also encourages peer-group development through cohort training and/or Graduate schools.

====Higher doctorates====
Higher doctorates are awarded in recognition of a substantial body of original research undertaken over the course of many years. Typically the candidate submits a collection of previously published, peer-refereed work, which is reviewed by a committee of internal and external academics who decide whether the candidate deserves the doctorate. The higher doctorate is similar in some respects to the habilitation in some European countries. However, the purpose of the award is significantly different. While the habilitation formally determines whether an academic is suitably qualified to be a university professor, the higher doctorate does not qualify the holder for a position but rather recognises their contribution to research.

Higher doctorates were defined by the UK Council for Graduate Education (UKCGE) in 2013 as:
In terms of number of institutions offering the awards, the most common doctorates of this type in UKCGE surveys carried out in 2008 and 2013 were the Doctor of Science (DSc), Doctor of Letters (DLitt), Doctor of Law (LLD), Doctor of Music (DMus) and Doctor of Divinity (DD); in the 2008 survey the Doctor of Technology (DTech) tied with the DD. The DSc was offered by all 49 responding institutions in 2008 and 15 out of 16 in 2013 and the DLitt by only one less in each case, while the DD was offered in 10 responding institutions in 2008 and 3 in 2013. In terms of number of higher doctorates awarded (not including honorary doctorates) the DSc was most popular, but the number of awards was very low: the responding institutions had averaged an award of at most one earned higher doctorate per year over the period 2003–2013.

====Honorary degrees====
Most British universities award degrees &quot;honoris causa&quot; to recognise individuals who have made a substantial contribution to a particular field. Usually an appropriate higher doctorate is used in these circumstances, depending on the candidate&#x27;s achievements. However, some universities differentiate between honorary and substantive doctorates, using the degree of Doctor of the University (D.Univ.) for these purposes, and reserve the higher doctorates for formal academic research.

===United States===
U.S. research doctorates are awarded for advanced study followed by successfully completing and defending independent research presented in the form of a dissertation. Professional degrees may use the term &quot;doctor&quot; in their titles, such as Juris Doctor and Doctor of Medicine, but these degrees rarely contain an independent research component and are not research doctorates. Law school graduates, although awarded the J.D. degree, are not normally addressed as &quot;doctor&quot;. In legal studies, the Doctor of Juridical Science is considered the equivalent to a Ph.D.

Many American universities offer the PhD followed by a professional doctorate or joint PhD with a professional degree. Often, PhD work is sequential to the professional degree, e.g., PhD in law after a JD or equivalent in physical therapy after DPT, in pharmacy after Pharm.D. Such professional degrees are referred to as an entry-level doctorate program and Ph.D. as a post-professional doctorate.

====Research degrees====

The most common research doctorate in the United States is the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). This degree was first awarded in the U.S. at the 1861 Yale University commencement. The University of Pennsylvania followed in 1871, with Cornell University (1872), Harvard (1873), Michigan (1876) and Princeton (1879) following suit. Controversy and opposition followed the introduction of the Ph.D. into the U.S. educational system, lasting into the 1950s, as it was seen as an unnecessary artificial transplant from a foreign (Germany) educational system, which corrupted a system based on England&#x27;s Oxbridge model.

Ph.D.s and other research doctorates in the U.S. typically entail successful completion of coursework, passing a comprehensive examination, and defending a dissertation.

The median number of years for completion of U.S. doctoral degrees is seven. Doctoral applicants were previously required to have a master&#x27;s degree, but many programs accept students immediately following undergraduate studies. Many programs gauge the potential of applicants to their program and grant a master&#x27;s degree upon completion of the necessary course work. When so admitted, the student is expected to have mastered the material covered in the master&#x27;s degree despite not holding one, though this tradition is under heavy criticism. Successfully finishing Ph.D. qualifying exams confers Ph.D. candidate status, allowing dissertation work to begin.

The International Affairs Office of the U.S. Department of Education has listed 18 frequently awarded research doctorate titles identified by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as representing degrees equivalent in research content to the Ph.D.

====Professional degrees====

Many fields offer professional doctorates (or professional master&#x27;s degrees) such as engineering, pharmacy, medicine, etc., that require such degrees for professional practice or licensure. Some of these degrees are also termed &quot;first professional degrees&quot;, since they are the first field-specific master&#x27;s or doctoral degrees.

A Doctor of Engineering (DEng) is a professional degree. In contrast to a PhD in Engineering where students usually conduct original theory-based research, DEng degrees are built around applied coursework and a practice-led project and thus designed for working engineers in the industry. DEng students defend their thesis at the end of their study before a thesis committee in order to be conferred a degree.

A Doctor of Pharmacy is awarded as the professional degree in pharmacy replacing a bachelor&#x27;s degree. It is the only professional pharmacy degree awarded in the US. Pharmacy programs vary in length between four years for matriculants with a B.S./B.A. to six years for others.

In the twenty-first century professional doctorates appeared in other fields, such as the Doctor of Audiology in 2007. Advanced Practice Registered Nurses were expected to completely transition to the Doctor of Nursing Practice by 2015, and physical therapists to the Doctor of Physical Therapy by 2020. Professional associations play a central role in this transformation amid criticisms on the lack of proper criteria to assure appropriate rigor. In many cases master&#x27;s-level programs were relabeled as doctoral programs.

==Revocation==

A doctoral degree can be revoked or rescinded by the university that awarded it. Possible reasons include plagiarism, criminal or unethical activities of the holder, or malfunction or manipulation of academic evaluation processes.

<doc id="188887" wikidata="Q138875" url="?curid=188887" title="Apollo Guidance Computer">
<text>The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) was a digital computer produced for the Apollo program that was installed on board each Apollo command module (CM) and Apollo Lunar Module (LM). The AGC provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance, navigation, and control of the spacecraft. The AGC was the first computer based on silicon integrated circuits. The computer&#x27;s performance was comparable to the first generation of home computers from the late 1970s, such as the Apple II, TRS-80, and Commodore PET.

The AGC has a 16-bit word length, with 15 data bits and one parity bit. Most of the software on the AGC is stored in a special read-only memory known as core rope memory, fashioned by weaving wires through and around magnetic cores, though a small amount of read/write core memory is available.

Astronauts communicated with the AGC using a numeric display and keyboard called the DSKY (for &quot;display and keyboard&quot;, pronounced &quot;DIS-kee&quot;). The AGC and its DSKY user interface were developed in the early 1960s for the Apollo program by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory and first flew in 1966.

==Operation==
Astronauts manually flew Project Gemini with control sticks, but computers flew most of Project Apollo except briefly during lunar landings. Each Moon flight carried two AGCs, one each in the command module and the Apollo Lunar Module, with the exception of Apollo 7 which was an Earth orbit mission and Apollo 8 which did not need a lunar module for its lunar orbit mission. The AGC in the command module was the center of its guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system. The AGC in the lunar module ran its Apollo PGNCS (primary guidance, navigation and control system), with the acronym pronounced as &quot;pings&quot;.


Each lunar mission had two additional computers:

* The Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) on the Saturn V booster instrumentation ring
* the Abort Guidance System (AGS, pronounced &quot;ags&quot;) of the lunar module, to be used in the event of failure of the LM PGNCS. The AGS could be used to take off from the Moon, and to rendezvous with the command module, but not to land.

==Design==

The AGC was designed at the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory under Charles Stark Draper, with hardware design led by Eldon C. Hall. Early architectural work came from J. H. Laning Jr., Albert Hopkins, Richard Battin, Ramon Alonso, and Hugh Blair-Smith.
The flight hardware was fabricated by Raytheon, whose Herb Thaler was also on the architectural team.

According to Kurinec et al, the chips were welded onto the boards rather than soldered as might be expected. Apollo Guidance Computer logic module drawings specify resistance-welding.
===Logic hardware===
Following the use of integrated circuit (IC) chips in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) in 1963, IC technology was later adopted for the AGC. The Apollo flight computer was the first computer to use silicon IC chips.

While the Block I version used 4,100 ICs, each containing a single three-input NOR gate, the later Block II version (used in the crewed flights) used about 2,800 ICs, mostly dual three-input NOR gates and smaller numbers of expanders and sense amplifiers. The ICs, from Fairchild Semiconductor, were implemented using resistor–transistor logic (RTL) in a flat-pack. They were connected via wire wrap, and the wiring was then embedded in cast epoxy plastic.

The use of a single type of IC (the dual NOR3) throughout the AGC avoided problems that plagued another early IC computer design, the Minuteman II guidance computer, which used a mix of diode–transistor logic and diode logic gates. NOR gates are universal logic gates from which any other gate can be made, though at the cost of using more gates.

===Memory===
The computer had 2,048 words of erasable magnetic-core memory and 36,864 words of read-only core rope memory. Both had cycle times of 11.72 microseconds. The memory word length was 16 bits: 15 bits of data and one odd-parity bit. The CPU-internal 16-bit word format was 14 bits of data, one overflow bit, and one sign bit (ones&#x27; complement representation).

=== DSKY interface===
The user interface to the AGC was the &quot;DSKY&quot;, standing for &quot;display and keyboard&quot; and usually pronounced &quot;&quot;DIS-kee&quot;.&quot; It has an array of indicator lights, numeric displays, and a calculator-style keyboard. Commands were entered numerically, as two-digit numbers: Verb and Noun. &quot;Verb&quot; described the type of action to be performed and &quot;Noun&quot; specified which data were affected by the action specified by the Verb command.

Each digit was displayed via a green (specified as 530 nm) high-voltage electroluminescent seven-segment display; these were driven by electromechanical relays, limiting the update rate. Three five-digit signed numbers could also be displayed in octal or decimal, and were typically used to display vectors such as space craft attitude or a required velocity change (delta-V). Although data was stored internally in metric units, they were displayed as United States customary units. This calculator-style interface was the first of its kind.

The command module has two DSKYs connected to its AGC: one located on the main instrument panel and a second located in the lower equipment bay near a sextant used for aligning the inertial guidance platform. The lunar module had a single DSKY for its AGC. A flight director attitude indicator (FDAI), controlled by the AGC, was located above the DSKY on the commander&#x27;s console and on the LM.

===Timing===
The AGC timing reference came from a 2.048 MHz crystal clock. The clock was divided by two to produce a four-phase 1.024 MHz clock which the AGC used to perform internal operations. The 1.024 MHz clock was also divided by two to produce a 512 kHz signal called the &quot;master frequency&quot;; this signal was used to synchronize external Apollo spacecraft systems.

The master frequency was further divided through a &quot;scaler&quot;, first by five using a ring counter to produce a 102.4 kHz signal. This was then divided by two through 17 successive stages called F1 (51.2 kHz) through F17 (0.78125 Hz). The F10 stage (100 Hz) was fed back into the AGC to increment the real-time clock and other involuntary counters using Pinc (discussed below). The F17 stage was used to intermittently run the AGC when it was operating in the &quot;standby&quot; mode.

===Central registers===
The AGC had four 16-bit registers for general computational use, called the &quot;central registers&quot;:
* A: The accumulator, for general computation
* Z: The program counter – the address of the next instruction to be executed
* Q: The remainder from the codice_1 instruction, and the return address after codice_2 instructions
* LP: The lower product after codice_3 instructions

There were also four locations in core memory, at addresses 20–23, dubbed &quot;editing locations&quot; because whatever was stored there would emerge shifted or rotated by one bit position, except for one that shifted right seven bit positions, to extract one of the seven-bit interpretive op. codes that were packed two to a word. This was common to Block I and Block II AGCs.

===Other registers===

The AGC had additional registers that were used internally in the course of operation:
* S: 12-bit memory address register, the lower portion of the memory address
* Bank/Fbank: 4-bit ROM bank register, to select the 1 kiloword ROM bank when addressing in the fixed-switchable mode
*Ebank: 3-bit RAM bank register, to select the 256-word RAM bank when addressing in the erasable-switchable mode
* Sbank (super-bank): 1-bit extension to Fbank, required because the last 4 kilowords of the 36-kiloword ROM was not reachable using Fbank alone
*SQ: 4-bit sequence register; the current instruction
*G: 16-bit memory buffer register, to hold data words moving to and from memory
*X: The &#x27;x&#x27; input to the &quot;adder&quot; (the adder was used to perform all 1&#x27;s complement arithmetic) or the increment to the program counter (Z register)
* Y: The other (&#x27;y&#x27;) input to the adder
*U: Not really a register, but the output of the adder (the ones&#x27; complement sum of the contents of registers X and Y)
*B: General-purpose buffer register, also used to pre-fetch the next instruction. At the start of the next instruction, the upper bits of B (containing the next op. code) were copied to SQ, and the lower bits (the address) were copied to S.
*C: Not a separate register, but the ones&#x27; complement of the B register
* IN: Four 16-bit input registers
* OUT: Five 16-bit output registers

===Instruction set===

The instruction format used 3 bits for opcode, and 12 bits for address. Block I had 11 instructions: codice_2, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, and codice_11 (basic), and codice_12, codice_3, and codice_1 (extra). The first eight, called &quot;basic instructions&quot;, were directly accessed by the 3-bit op. code. The final three were denoted as &quot;extracode instructions&quot; because they were accessed by performing a special type of codice_2 instruction (called codice_16) immediately before the instruction.

The Block I AGC instructions consisted of the following:
;codice_2 (transfer control): An unconditional branch to the address specified by the instruction. The return address was automatically stored in the Q register, so the codice_2 instruction could be used for subroutine calls.
;codice_5 (count, compare, and skip): A complex conditional branch instruction. The A register was loaded with data retrieved from the address specified by the instruction. (Because the AGC uses ones&#x27; complement notation, there are two representations of zero. When all bits are set to zero, this is called &quot;plus zero&quot;. If all bits are set to one, this is called &quot;minus zero&quot;.) The &quot;diminished absolute value&quot; (DABS) of the data was then computed and stored in the A register. If the number was greater than zero, the DABS decrements the value by 1; if the number was negative, it is complemented before the decrement is applied—this is the absolute value. &quot;Diminished&quot; means &quot;decremented but not below zero&quot;. Therefore, when the AGC performs the DABS function, positive numbers will head toward plus zero, and so will negative numbers but first revealing their negativity via the four-way skip below. The final step in codice_5 is a four-way skip, depending upon the data in register A before the DABS. If register A was greater than 0, codice_5 skips to the first instruction immediately after codice_5. If register A contained plus zero, codice_5 skips to the second instruction after codice_5. Less than zero causes a skip to the third instruction after codice_5, and minus zero skips to the fourth instruction after codice_5. The primary purpose of the count was to allow an ordinary loop, controlled by a positive counter, to end in a codice_5 and a codice_2 to the beginning of the loop, equivalent to an IBM 360&#x27;s codice_29. The absolute value function was deemed important enough to be built into this instruction; when used for only this purpose, the sequence after the codice_5 was codice_2 *+2, codice_2 *+2, codice_10 ONE. A curious side effect was the creation and use of &quot;codice_5-holes&quot; when the value being tested was known to be never positive, which occurred more often than one might suppose. That left two whole words unoccupied, and a special committee was responsible for assigning data constants to these holes.
;codice_6: Add the data retrieved at the address specified by the instruction to the next instruction. codice_6 can be used to add or subtract an index value to the base address specified by the operand of the instruction that follows codice_6. This method is used to implement arrays and table look-ups; since the addition was done on both whole words, it was also used to modify the op. code in a following (extracode) instruction, and on rare occasions both functions at once.
;codice_38: A special instance of codice_6 (codice_6 25). This is the instruction used to return from interrupts. It causes execution to resume at the interrupted location.
;codice_7 (exchange): Exchange the contents of memory with the contents of the A register. If the specified memory address is in fixed (read-only) memory, the memory contents are not affected, and this instruction simply loads register A. If it is in erasable memory, overflow &quot;correction&quot; is achieved by storing the leftmost of the 16 bits in A as the sign bit in memory, but there is no exceptional behavior like that of codice_9.
;codice_8 (clear and subtract): Load register A with the ones&#x27; complement of the data referenced by the specified memory address.
;codice_9 (transfer to storage): Store register A at the specified memory address. codice_9 also detects, and corrects for, overflows in such a way as to propagate a carry for multi-precision add/subtract. If the result has no overflow (leftmost 2 bits of A the same), nothing special happens; if there is overflow (those 2 bits differ), the leftmost one goes the memory as the sign bit, register A is changed to +1 or −1 accordingly, and control skips to the second instruction following the codice_9. Whenever overflow is a possible but abnormal event, the codice_9 was followed by a codice_2 to the no-overflow logic; when it is a normal possibility (as in multi-precision add/subtract), the codice_9 is followed by codice_50 ZERO (codice_50 = codice_7 to fixed memory) to complete the formation of the carry (+1, 0, or −1) into the next higher-precision word. Angles were kept in single precision, distances and velocities in double precision, and elapsed time in triple precision.
;codice_10 (add): Add the contents of memory to register A and store the result in A. The 2 leftmost bits of A may be different (overflow state) before and/or after the codice_10. The fact that overflow is a state rather than an event forgives limited extents of overflow when adding more than two numbers, as long as none of the intermediate totals exceed twice the capacity of a word.
;codice_11: Perform a bit-wise (boolean) &quot;and&quot; of memory with register A and store the result in register A.
;codice_3 (multiply): Multiply the contents of register A by the data at the referenced memory address and store the high-order product in register A and the low-order product in register LP. The parts of the product agree in sign.
;codice_1 (divide): Divide the contents of register A by the data at the referenced memory address. Store the quotient in register A and the absolute value of the remainder in register Q. Unlike modern machines, fixed-point numbers were treated as fractions (notional decimal point just to right of the sign bit), so you could produce garbage if the divisor was not larger than the dividend; there was no protection against that situation. In the Block II AGC, a double-precision dividend started in A and L (the Block II LP), and the correctly signed remainder was delivered in L. That considerably simplified the subroutine for double precision division.
;codice_12 (subtract): Subtract (ones&#x27; complement) the data at the referenced memory address from the contents of register A and store the result in A.

Instructions were implemented in groups of 12 steps, called &quot;timing pulses&quot;. The timing pulses were named TP1 through TP12. Each set of 12 timing pulses was called an instruction &quot;subsequence&quot;. Simple instructions, such as TC, executed in a single subsequence of 12 pulses. More complex instructions required several subsequences. The multiply instruction (codice_3) used 8 subsequences: an initial one called codice_60, followed by an codice_61 subsequence which was repeated 6 times, and then terminated by an codice_62 subsequence. This was reduced to 3 subsequences in Block II.

Each timing pulse in a subsequence could trigger up to 5 &quot;control pulses&quot;. The control pulses were the signals which did the actual work of the instruction, such as reading the contents of a register onto the bus, or writing data from the bus into a register.

===Memory===
Block I AGC memory was organized into 1 kiloword banks. The lowest bank (bank 0) was erasable memory (RAM). All banks above bank 0 were fixed memory (ROM). Each AGC instruction had a 12-bit address field. The lower bits (1-10) addressed the memory inside each bank. Bits 11 and 12 selected the bank: 00 selected the erasable memory bank; 01 selected the lowest bank (bank 1) of fixed memory; 10 selected the next one (bank 2); and 11 selected the &quot;Bank&quot; register that could be used to select any bank above 2. Banks 1 and 2 were called &quot;fixed-fixed&quot; memory, because they were always available, regardless of the contents of the Bank register. Banks 3 and above were called &quot;fixed-switchable&quot; because the selected bank was determined by the bank register.

The Block I AGC initially had 12 kilowords of fixed memory, but this was later increased to 24 kilowords. Block II had 36 kilowords of fixed memory and 2 kilowords of erasable memory.

The AGC transferred data to and from memory through the G register in a process called the &quot;memory cycle&quot;. The memory cycle took 12 timing pulses (11.72 μs). The cycle began at timing pulse 1 (TP1) when the AGC loaded the memory address to be fetched into the S register. The memory hardware retrieved the data word from memory at the address specified by the S register. Words from erasable memory were deposited into the G register by timing pulse 6 (TP6); words from fixed memory were available by timing pulse 7. The retrieved memory word was then available in the G register for AGC access during timing pulses 7 through 10. After timing pulse 10, the data in the G register was written back to memory.

The AGC memory cycle occurred continuously during AGC operation. Instructions needing memory data had to access it during timing pulses 7–10. If the AGC changed the memory word in the G register, the changed word was written back to memory after timing pulse 10. In this way, data words cycled continuously from memory to the G register and then back again to memory.

The lower 15 bits of each memory word held AGC instructions or data, with each word being protected by a 16th odd parity bit. This bit was set to 1 or 0 by a parity generator circuit so a count of the 1s in each memory word would always produce an odd number. A parity checking circuit tested the parity bit during each memory cycle; if the bit didn&#x27;t match the expected value, the memory word was assumed to be corrupted and a &quot;parity alarm&quot; panel light was illuminated.

===Interrupts and involuntary counters===
The AGC had five vectored interrupts:
* &quot;Dsrupt&quot; was triggered at regular intervals to update the user display (DSKY).
* &quot;Erupt&quot; was generated by various hardware failures or alarms.
* &quot;Keyrupt&quot; signaled a key press from the user&#x27;s keyboard.
* &quot;T3Rrupt&quot; was generated at regular intervals from a hardware timer to update the AGC&#x27;s real-time clock.
* &quot;Uprupt&quot; was generated each time a 16-bit word of uplink data was loaded into the AGC.
The AGC responded to each interrupt by temporarily suspending the current program, executing a short interrupt service routine, and then resuming the interrupted program.

The AGC also had 20 involuntary counters. These were memory locations which functioned as up/down counters, or shift registers. The counters would increment, decrement, or shift in response to internal inputs. The increment (&quot;Pinc&quot;), decrement (&quot;Minc&quot;), or shift (&quot;Shinc&quot;) was handled by one subsequence of microinstructions inserted between any two regular instructions.

Interrupts could be triggered when the counters overflowed. The T3rupt and Dsrupt interrupts were produced when their counters, driven by a 100 Hz hardware clock, overflowed after executing many Pinc subsequences. The Uprupt interrupt was triggered after its counter, executing the Shinc subsequence, had shifted 16 bits of uplink data into the AGC.

===Standby mode===
The AGC had a power-saving mode controlled by a &quot;standby allowed&quot; switch. This mode turned off the AGC power, except for the 2.048 MHz clock and the scaler. The F17 signal from the scaler turned the AGC power and the AGC back on at 1.28 second intervals. In this mode, the AGC performed essential functions, checked the standby allowed switch, and, if still enabled, turned off the power and went back to sleep until the next F17 signal.

In the standby mode, the AGC slept most of the time; therefore it was not awake to perform the Pinc instruction needed to update the AGC&#x27;s real time clock at 10 ms intervals. To compensate, one of the functions performed by the AGC each time it awoke in the standby mode was to update the real time clock by 1.28 seconds.

The standby mode was designed to reduce power by 5 to 10 W (from 70 W) during midcourse flight when the AGC was not needed. However, in practice, the AGC was left on during all phases of the mission and this feature was never used.

===Data buses===
The AGC had a 16-bit read bus and a 16-bit write bus. Data from central registers (A, Q, Z, or LP), or other internal registers could be gated onto the read bus with a control signal. The read bus connected to the write bus through a non-inverting buffer, so any data appearing on the read bus also appeared on the write bus. Other control signals could copy write bus data back into the registers.

Data transfers worked like this: To move the address of the next instruction from the B register to the S register, an RB (read B) control signal was issued; this caused the address to move from register B to the read bus, and then to the write bus. A WS (write S) control signal moved the address from the write bus into the S register.

Several registers could be read onto the read bus simultaneously. When this occurred, data from each register was inclusive-&quot;OR&quot;ed onto the bus. This inclusive-&quot;OR&quot; feature was used to implement the Mask instruction, which was a logical &quot;AND&quot; operation. Because the AGC had no native ability to do a logical &quot;AND&quot;, but could do a logical &quot;OR&quot; through the bus and could complement (invert) data through the C register, De Morgan&#x27;s theorem was used to implement the equivalent of a logical &quot;AND&quot;. This was accomplished by inverting both operands, performing a logical &quot;OR&quot; through the bus, and then inverting the result.

=== Software ===

AGC software was written in AGC assembly language and stored on rope memory. The bulk of the software was on read-only rope memory and thus could not be changed in operation, but some key parts of the software were stored in standard read-write magnetic-core memory and could be overwritten by the astronauts using the DSKY interface, as was done on Apollo 14.

A simple real-time operating system designed by J. Halcombe Laning consisting of the &#x27;Exec&#x27;, a batch job-scheduling using cooperative multi-tasking, and an interrupt-driven pre-emptive scheduler called the &#x27;Waitlist&#x27; which scheduled timer-driven &#x27;tasks&#x27;, controlled the computer. Tasks were short threads of execution which could reschedule themselves for re-execution on the Waitlist, or could kick off a longer operation by starting a &#x27;job&#x27; with the Exec. Calculations were carried out using the metric system, but display readouts were in units of feet, feet per second, and nautical miles – units that the Apollo astronauts were accustomed to.

The AGC had a sophisticated software interpreter, developed by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, that implemented a virtual machine with more complex and capable pseudo-instructions than the native AGC. These instructions simplified the navigational programs. Interpreted code, which featured double precision trigonometric, scalar and vector arithmetic (16 and 24-bit), even an codice_63 (matrix × vector) instruction, could be mixed with native AGC code. While the execution time of the pseudo-instructions was increased (due to the need to interpret these instructions at runtime) the interpreter provided many more instructions than AGC natively supported and the memory requirements were much lower than in the case of adding these instructions to the AGC native language which would require additional memory built into the computer (in the 1960s memory was very expensive). The average pseudo-instruction required about 24 ms to execute. The assembler, named &quot;YUL&quot; for an early prototype &quot;Christmas Computer&quot;, enforced proper transitions between native and interpreted code.

A set of interrupt-driven user interface routines called &#x27;Pinball&#x27; provided keyboard and display services for the jobs and tasks running on the AGC. A set of user-accessible routines were provided to let the astronauts display the contents of various memory locations in octal or decimal in groups of 1, 2, or 3 registers at a time. &#x27;Monitor&#x27; routines were provided so the operator could initiate a task to periodically redisplay the contents of certain memory locations. Jobs could be initiated.

The design principles developed for the AGC by MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, directed in late 1960s by Charles Draper, became foundational to software engineering—particularly for the design of more reliable systems that relied on asynchronous software, priority scheduling, testing, and human-in-the-loop decision capability. When the design requirements for the AGC were defined, necessary software and programming techniques did not exist so they had to be designed from scratch. Many of the trajectory and guidance algorithms used were based on earlier work by Richard Battin. The first command module flight was controlled by a software package called CORONA whose development was led by Alex Kosmala. Software for lunar missions consisted of COLOSSUS for the command module, whose development was led by Frederic Martin, and LUMINARY on the lunar module led by George Cherry. Details of these programs were implemented by a team under the direction of Margaret Hamilton. Hamilton was very interested in how the astronauts would interact with the software and predicted the types of errors that could occur due to human error. In total, software development on the project comprised 1400 person-years of effort, with a peak workforce of 350 people. In 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her role in creating the flight software.

The Apollo Guidance Computer software influenced the design of Skylab, Space Shuttle and early fly-by-wire fighter aircraft systems. 

The Apollo Guidance computer has been called &quot;The fourth astronaut&quot; for its role in helping the three astronauts who relied on it: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.

==Block II==
A Block II version of the AGC was designed in 1966. It retained the basic Block I architecture, but increased erasable memory from 1 to 2 kilowords. Fixed memory was expanded from 24 to 36 kilowords. Instructions were expanded from 11 to 34 and I/O channels were implemented to replace the I/O registers on Block I. The Block II version is the one that actually flew to the moon. Block I was used during the uncrewed Apollo 4 and 6 flights, and was on board the ill-fated Apollo 1.

The decision to expand the memory and instruction set for Block II, but to retain the Block I&#x27;s restrictive three-bit op. code and 12-bit address had interesting design consequences. Various tricks were employed to squeeze in additional instructions, such as having special memory addresses which, when referenced, would implement a certain function. For instance, an codice_6 to address 25 triggered the codice_38 instruction to return from an interrupt. Likewise, codice_6 17 performed an codice_67 instruction (inhibit interrupts), while codice_6 16 reenabled them (codice_69). Other instructions were implemented by preceding them with a special version of codice_2 called codice_16. The address spaces were extended by employing the Bank (fixed) and Ebank (erasable) registers, so the only memory of either type that could be addressed at any given time was the current bank, plus the small amount of fixed-fixed memory and the erasable memory. In addition, the bank register could address a maximum of 32 kilowords, so an Sbank (super-bank) register was required to access the last 4 kilowords. All across-bank subroutine calls had to be initiated from fixed-fixed memory through special functions to restore the original bank during the return: essentially a system of far pointers.

The Block II AGC also has the codice_72 instruction (the name is a contraction of &quot;Ed&#x27;s Interrupt&quot;, after Ed Smally, the programmer who requested it). This instruction does not generate an interrupt, rather it performs two actions that are common to interrupt processing. The first action, inhibits further interrupts (and requires a codice_73 instruction to enable them again). In the second action, the codice_74 register is loaded with the current value of the program counter (Z). It was only used once in the Apollo software, for setting up the DAP cycle termination sequence in the Digital Autopilot of the lunar module. It is believed to be responsible for problems emulating the LEM AGC Luminary software.

== 1201 and 1202 program alarms ==

PGNCS generated unanticipated warnings during Apollo 11&#x27;s lunar descent, with the AGC showing a &quot;1202 alarm&quot; (&quot;Executive overflow - NO CORE SETS&quot;), and then a &quot;1201 alarm&quot; (&quot;Executive overflow - NO VAC AREAS&quot;). The response of the AGC to either alarm was a soft restart. The cause was a rapid, steady stream of spurious cycle steals from the rendezvous radar (tracking the orbiting command module), intentionally left on standby during the descent in case it was needed for an abort.

During this part of the approach, the processor would normally be almost 85% loaded. The extra 6,400 cycle steals per second added the equivalent of 13% load, leaving just enough time for all scheduled tasks to run to completion. Five minutes into the descent, Buzz Aldrin gave the computer the command &quot;1668&quot;, which instructed it to periodically calculate and display DELTAH (the difference between altitude sensed by the radar and the computed altitude). The &quot;1668&quot; added another 10% to the processor workload, causing executive overflow and a &quot;1202&quot; alarm. After being given the &quot;GO&quot; from Houston, Aldrin entered &quot;1668&quot; again and another &quot;1202&quot; alarm occurred. When reporting the second alarm, Aldrin added the comment &quot;It appears to come up when we have a &quot;1668&quot; up&quot;. The AGC software had been designed with priority scheduling, and automatically recovered, deleting lower priority tasks including the &quot;1668&quot; display task, to complete its critical guidance and control tasks. Guidance controller Steve Bales and his support team that included Jack Garman issued several &quot;GO&quot; calls and the landing was successful.

The problem was not a programming error in the AGC, nor was it pilot error. It was a peripheral hardware design bug that had already been known and documented by Apollo 5 engineers. However, because the problem had only occurred once during testing, they concluded that it was safer to fly with the existing hardware that they had already tested, than to fly with a newer but largely untested radar system. In the actual hardware, the position of the rendezvous radar was encoded with synchros excited by a different source of 800 Hz AC than the one used by the computer as a timing reference. The two 800 Hz sources were frequency locked but not phase locked, and the small random phase variations made it appear as though the antenna was rapidly &quot;dithering&quot; in position, even though it was completely stationary. These phantom movements generated the rapid series of cycle steals.

J. Halcombe Laning&#x27;s software and computer design saved the Apollo 11 landing mission. Had it not been for Laning&#x27;s design, the landing would have been aborted for lack of a stable guidance computer.

==Applications outside Apollo==

The AGC formed the basis of an experimental fly-by-wire (FBW) system installed into an F-8 Crusader to demonstrate the practicality of computer driven FBW. The AGC used in the first phase of the program was replaced with another machine in the second phase, and research done on the program led to the development of fly-by-wire systems for the Space Shuttle. The AGC also led, albeit indirectly, to the development of fly-by-wire systems for the generation of fighters that were being developed at the time.

== Source code release ==
In 2003, Ron Burkey initiated the Virtual AGC Project, aiming to recover the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) source code and build a functional emulator. As part of this project, the original code, transcribed and digitized from 1960s hard copies, was made available through the Virtual AGC Project and MIT Museum. This effort gained renewed attention in mid-2016 when former NASA intern Chris Garry uploaded the code to GitHub, generating significant media attention.

<doc id="188888" wikidata="Q926734" url="?curid=188888" title="Neutron source">
<text>A neutron source is any device that emits neutrons, irrespective of the mechanism used to produce the neutrons. Neutron sources are used in physics, engineering, medicine, nuclear weapons, petroleum exploration, biology, chemistry, and nuclear power. Neutron source variables include the energy of the neutrons emitted by the source, the rate of neutrons emitted by the source, the size of the source, the cost of owning and maintaining the source, and government regulations related to the source.

==Small devices==

===Spontaneous fission===
Some isotopes undergo spontaneous fission (SF) with emission of neutrons. The most common spontaneous fission source is the isotope californium-252. 252Cf and all other SF neutron sources are made by irradiating uranium or a transuranic element in a nuclear reactor, where neutrons are absorbed in the starting material and its subsequent reaction products, transmuting the starting material into the SF isotope. 252Cf neutron sources are typically 1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot; in diameter and 1&quot; to 2&quot; in length. A typical 252Cf neutron source emits 107 to 109 neutrons per second when new; but with a half-life of 2.6 years, neutron output drops by half in 2.6 years. 

===Alpha decay===
Neutrons are produced when alpha particles hit any of several light isotopes including isotopes of beryllium, carbon, or oxygen. Thus, a neutron source can be fabricated by mixing an alpha-emitter such as radium, polonium, or americium with a low-atomic-weight isotope, usually by blending powders of the two materials. Alpha neutron sources typically produce ~106–108 neutrons per second. An alpha-beryllium neutron source may produce about 30 neutrons per 106 alpha particles. The useful lifetime for such sources depends on the half-life of the radioisotope. The size and cost of these neutron sources are comparable to spontaneous fission sources. Usual combinations of materials are plutonium-beryllium (PuBe), americium-beryllium (AmBe), or americium-lithium (AmLi).

=== Photodisintegration ===
Gamma radiation with an energy exceeding the neutron binding energy of a nucleus can eject a neutron, a process known as photodisintegration. Two example reactions are:
*9Be + &gt;1.7 MeV photon → 1 neutron + 2 4He
*2H (deuterium) + &gt;2.26 MeV photon → 1 neutron + 1H

===Sealed-tube neutron generators===
Some accelerator-based neutron generators induce fusion between beams of deuterium and/or tritium ions and metal hydride targets which also contain these isotopes.

==Medium-sized devices==

===Dense plasma focus===
The dense plasma focus neutron source produces controlled nuclear fusion by creating a dense plasma within which heats ionized deuterium and/or tritium gas to temperatures sufficient for creating fusion.

===Inertial electrostatic confinement===
Inertial electrostatic confinement devices such as the Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor use an electric field to heat a plasma to fusion conditions and produce neutrons. Various applications from a hobby enthusiast scene up to commercial applications have developed, mostly in the US.

===Light ion accelerators===
Traditional particle accelerators with hydrogen, deuterium, or tritium ion sources may be used to produce neutrons using targets of deuterium, tritium, lithium, beryllium, and other low-Z materials. Typically these accelerators operate with energies in the &gt; 1 MeV range.

===&quot;Bremsstrahlung&quot; systems===
In a &quot;bremsstrahlung&quot; system, Neutrons are produced when photons above the nuclear binding energy of a substance are incident on that substance, causing it to undergo giant dipole resonance after which it either emits a neutron (photoneutron) or undergoes fission (photofission). The number of neutrons released by each fission event is dependent on the substance. Typically photons begin to produce neutrons on interaction with normal matter at energies of about 7 to 40 MeV, which means that radiotherapy facilities using megavoltage X-rays also produce neutrons, and some require neutron shielding. In addition, electrons of energy over about 50 MeV may induce giant dipole resonance in nuclides by a mechanism which is the inverse of internal conversion and thus produce neutrons by a mechanism similar to that of photoneutrons.

==Large devices==
===Nuclear fission reactors===
Nuclear fission within a reactor, produces many neutrons and can be used for a variety of purposes including power generation and experiments. Research reactors are often specially designed to allow placement of material samples into a high neutron flux environment.

===Nuclear fusion systems===
Nuclear fusion, the fusing of heavy isotopes of hydrogen, has the potential to produces large numbers of neutrons. Small scale fusion systems exist for (plasma) research purposes at many universities and laboratories around the world. A small number of large scale fusion experiments also exist including the National Ignition Facility in the US, JET in the UK, and soon the ITER experiment currently under construction in France. None are yet used as neutron sources.

Inertial confinement fusion has the potential to produce orders of magnitude more neutrons than spallation. This could be useful for neutron radiography which can be used to locate hydrogen atoms in structures, resolve atomic thermal motion and study collective excitation of nuclei more effectively than X-rays.

===High-energy particle accelerators===
A spallation source is a high-flux source in which protons that have been accelerated to high energies hit a target, prompting emission of neutrons. The world&#x27;s strongest neutron sources tend to be spallation based as high flux fission reactors have an upper bound of neutrons produced. As of 2022, the most powerful neutron source in the world is the Spallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, with the European Spallation Source in Lund, Sweden under construction to become the world&#x27;s strongest intermediate duration pulsed neutron source. 

Subcritical nuclear fission reactors are proposed to use spallation neutron sources and can be used both for nuclear transmutation (e.g. production of medical radionuclides or synthesis of precious metals) and for power generation as the energy required to produce one spallation neutron (~30 MeV at current technology levels) is almost an order of magnitude lower than the energy released by fission (~200 MeV for most fissile actinides).

Laser-driven neutron sources are further another emerging technology that uses ultra-intense laser pulses to produce neutrons through secondary nuclear reactions. When high-power lasers interact with dense targets, they generate high-energy particles such as protons or deuterons, which can then collide with a secondary material, inducing neutron emission. These sources are compact compared to traditional spallation or reactor-based facilities and provide unique capabilities, including ultra-short neutron bursts and high brilliance.

==Neutron flux==
For most applications, higher neutron flux is better (since it reduces the time needed to do the experiment, acquire the image, etc.). Amateur fusion devices, like a fusor, generate only about 300 000 neutrons per second. Commercial fusor devices can generate on the order of 109 neutrons per second, hence a usable flux of less than 105 n/(cm2 s). Large neutron beams around the world achieve much greater flux. Reactor-based sources now produce 1015 n/(cm2 s), and spallation sources generate &gt; 1017 n/(cm2 s).

<text>The Entente Cordiale (; ) comprised a series of agreements signed on 8 April 1904 between the United Kingdom and the French Republic which saw a significant improvement in Anglo-French relations.

== Background ==

The French term &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot; (usually translated as &quot;cordial agreement&quot; or &quot;cordial understanding&quot;) comes from a letter written in 1843 by the British Foreign Secretary Lord Aberdeen to his brother, in which he mentioned &quot;a cordial, good understanding&quot; between the two nations. This was translated into French as &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot; and used by Louis Philippe I in the French Chamber of Peers that year. When used today the term almost always denotes the &quot;second&quot; Entente Cordiale, that is to say, the written and partly secret agreement signed in London between the two powers on 8 April 1904.

The agreement was a change for both countries. France had been isolated from the other European powers, in part because of the destruction of the Napoleonic Wars, threat of liberalism and perceived recklessness in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck also managed to estrange France from potential allies, taking advantage of fears France might seek revenge for its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, reverse its territorial losses and continue to press for the conquest of the Saar and territories in the Ruhr. Britain was maintaining a policy of &quot;splendid isolation&quot; on the European continent, ceasing to be concerned with the balance of power and intervening in continental affairs only when it was considered necessary to protect British interests. The situation for Britain and France changed in the last decade of the 19th century.

The change had its roots in a British loss of confidence after the Second Boer War and a growing fear of the strength of Germany. As early as March 1881, the French statesman Léon Gambetta and the Prince of Wales, Albert Edward, met at the Château de Breteuil to discuss an alliance against Germany. 

The Scramble for Africa prevented the countries from coming to terms. A colonial dispute in 1898 between France and Britain came to boiling point in the Sudan with the Fashoda Incident, in which both countries sought to gain control of the Upper Nile river basin. France, however, recognised that she was at a severe disadvantage with Britain and backed down, suffering a diplomatic humiliation. Théophile Delcassé, the newly appointed French foreign minister, nevertheless was keen to gain Britain&#x27;s friendship in case of any future conflict with Germany.

On the initiative of Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain, there were three rounds of British-German talks between 1898 and 1901. The British decided not to join the Triple Alliance, broke off the negotiations with Berlin, and revived the idea of a British-French alliance.
When the Russo-Japanese War was about to erupt, France and Britain found themselves on the verge of being dragged into the conflict on the side of their respective allies. France was firmly allied with Russia, while the British had recently signed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. In order to avoid going to war, both powers &quot;shucked off their ancient rivalry&quot; and resolved their differences in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. Toward this end, French foreign minister Théophile Delcassé, and Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary, negotiated an agreement on colonial matters, and Lord Lansdowne and Paul Cambon, the French Ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s, signed the resulting convention on 8 April 1904.

==Documents signed==

The Entente was composed of three documents:
* The first and most important document was the Declaration respecting Egypt and Morocco. In return for the French promising not to &quot;obstruct&quot; British actions in Egypt, the British promised to allow the French to &quot;preserve order ... and provide assistance&quot; in Morocco. Free passage through the Suez Canal was guaranteed, finally putting the Convention of Constantinople into force, and the erection of fortifications on part of the Moroccan coast forbidden. The treaty contained a secret annex dealing with the possibility of &quot;changed circumstances&quot; in the administration of either of the two countries.
* The second document dealt with Newfoundland and portions of West and Central Africa. The French gave up their rights (stemming from the Treaty of Utrecht) over the western coast of Newfoundland, although they retained the right to fish the coast. In return, the British gave the French the town of Yarbutenda (near the modern border between Senegal and the Gambia) and the Iles de Los (part of modern Guinea). An additional provision dealt with the border between French and British possessions east of the River Niger (present-day Niger and Nigeria).
* The final declaration concerned Siam (Thailand), Madagascar, and the New Hebrides (Vanuatu). In Siam, the British recognised a proposed French sphere of influence to the east of the Menam (Chao Phraya) River basin; in turn, the French recognised a proposed British influence over the territory to the west of the Menam basin. Both parties eventually disclaimed any idea of annexing Siamese territory. The British withdrew their objection to the French introducing a tariff in Madagascar. The parties came to an agreement which would &quot;put an end to the difficulties arising from the lack of jurisdiction over the natives of the New Hebrides&quot;.

On the surface, the agreement dealt with issues strictly related to fishing and colonial boundaries. Egypt was recognized as part of Britain&#x27;s sphere of influence, and Morocco as part of France&#x27;s. The Entente was not a formal alliance and did not involve close collaboration, nor was it intended to be directed against Germany. However, it paved the way for a stronger relationship between France and Britain in the face of German aggression. It should not be mistaken for the official Anglo-French military alliance, which was only established after the outbreak of World War I in 1914.
The main colonial agreement was the recognition that Egypt was fully in the British sphere of influence and likewise Morocco in France&#x27;s, with the proviso that France&#x27;s eventual dispositions for Morocco include reasonable allowance for Spain&#x27;s interests there. At the same time, Britain ceded the Los Islands (off French Guinea) to France, defined the frontier of Nigeria in France&#x27;s favour, and agreed to French control of the upper Gambia valley; while France renounced its exclusive right to certain fisheries off Newfoundland. Furthermore, French and British proposed zones of influence in Siam (Thailand), which was eventually decided not to be colonised, were outlined, with the eastern territories, adjacent to French Indochina, becoming a proposed French zone, and the western, adjacent to Burmese Tenasserim, a proposed British zone. Arrangements were also made to allay the rivalry between British and French colonists in the New Hebrides.

In long-term perspective, the Entente Cordiale marked the end of almost a thousand years of intermittent conflict between the two states and their predecessors, and replaced the &quot;modus vivendi&quot; that had existed since the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 with a more formal agreement. The Entente Cordiale represented the culmination of the policy of Théophile Delcassé (France&#x27;s foreign minister from 1898 to 1905), who believed that a Franco-British understanding would give France some security in Western Europe against any German system of alliances (see Triple Alliance (1882)). Credit for the success of the negotiation of the Entente Cordiale belongs chiefly to Paul Cambon (France&#x27;s ambassador in London from 1898 to 1920) and to the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Lansdowne. In signing the Entente Cordiale, both powers reduced the virtual isolation into which they each had withdrawn. Britain had no major-power ally apart from Japan (1902). France had only the Franco-Russian Alliance. The agreement threatened Germany, whose policy had long relied on Franco-British antagonism. A German attempt to check the French in Morocco in 1905 (the Tangier Incident, or First Moroccan Crisis), and thus to upset the Entente, served only to strengthen it. Military discussions between the French and the British general staffs were initiated. Franco-British solidarity was confirmed at the Algeciras Conference (1906) and reconfirmed in the Second Moroccan Crisis (1911).

== Aftermath ==
It is unclear what exactly the &quot;Entente&quot; meant to the British Foreign Office. For example, in early 1911, following French press reports contrasting the virility of the Triple Alliance with the moribund state of the &quot;Entente&quot;, Eyre Crowe minuted: &quot;The fundamental fact of course is that the &quot;Entente&quot; is not an alliance. For purposes of ultimate emergencies it may be found to have no substance at all. For the &quot;Entente&quot; is nothing more than a frame of mind, a view of general policy which is shared by the governments of two countries, but which may be, or become, so vague as to lose all content.&quot;

Such commentary however proved spurious, for the Triple Alliance collapsed as a result of Italy remaining neutral at the outbreak of World War I, while the Entente endured.
==Commemoration==
The 100th anniversary of the Entente Cordiale in 2004 was marked by a number of official and unofficial events, including a state visit to France in April by Queen Elizabeth II, and a return visit by President Jacques Chirac in November. British troops (the band of the Royal Marines, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, the Grenadier Guards and the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery) also led the Bastille Day parade in Paris for the first time, with the Red Arrows flying overhead.

At both London Waterloo International and Paris Gare du Nord, the flags of United Kingdom and of France were depicted, connected with the words &#x27;Entente cordiale&#x27; superimposed on posters. Some French political leaders had complained about the name &quot;Waterloo&quot; for the destination of trains from Paris, because the London terminus is named after the 1815 battle in which a British-led alliance defeated Napoleon&#x27;s army, and in 1998 French politician Florent Longuepée wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair demanding, without success, that the name be changed. However, in November 2007 St Pancras International became the new London terminus for the Eurostar service.

In April 2024, to commemorate the 120th anniversary of the Entente Cordiale, France&#x27;s Gendarmerie&#x27;s Garde Républicaine took part in the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace.

===Entente Cordiale Scholarships===
The name &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot; is used for the Entente Cordiale Scholarships scheme, a selective Franco-British scholarship scheme which was announced on 30 October 1995 by British Prime Minister John Major and French President Jacques Chirac at an Anglo-French summit in London.
It provides funding for British and French students to study for one academic year on the other side of the Channel. The scheme is administered by the French embassy in London for British students, and by the British Council in France and the British embassy in Paris for French students. Funding is provided by the private sector and foundations. The scheme aims to foster mutual understanding and to promote exchanges between the British and French leaders of tomorrow. The programme was initiated by Sir Christopher Mallaby, British ambassador to France between 1993 and 1996.

<text>Nathaniel Bacon (January 3, 1647October 26, 1676) was an English merchant adventurer who immigrated to the Virginia Colony, where he sat on the Governor&#x27;s Council but later led Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion. The Rebellion was briefly successful; but after Bacon’s death from dysentery the rebel forces collapsed.

== Early life and education ==

Bacon was born on January 3, 1647, in Friston Hall in Suffolk, England, to influential landowner parents Thomas Bacon and his wife Elizabeth (daughter of Sir Robert Brooke of Cockfield Hall, Yoxford and his wife Elizabeth). Nathaniel was his father&#x27;s only son, and had one full sister, and a half-sister by his father&#x27;s second wife Martha (Reade), his natural mother having died in 1649 when he was two years old. He was educated at the University of Cambridge, where he was admitted as a Fellow-Commoner at St Catharine&#x27;s College in 1661. He traveled around Europe (Germany, Italy, Switzerland, France, Netherlands) in 1663–1664 with the celebrated naturalist John Ray and fellow pupils Francis Willughby and Philip Skippon. At the end of April 1664, in Naples, Ray and Skippon took ship for Messina, to continue their expedition together to Sicily, leaving Willughby and Bacon to return north to Rome. He was admitted to study law at Gray&#x27;s Inn in November 1664.

Nathaniel married Elizabeth Duke, the daughter of Sir Edward Duke of Benhall (1604–1671) and his wife Ellenor Panton, reputedly in direct defiance of her father&#x27;s veto. After accusations that Nathaniel had cheated another young man of his inheritance, Thomas Bacon gave his son the considerable sum of £1,800 and the young man sailed into exile across the Atlantic. Upon arriving in Virginia, Nathaniel Bacon bought two frontier plantations on the James River.

==Immigration to Virginia==
Since his cousin and namesake Nathaniel Bacon was a prominent colonial leader and friend of governor William Berkeley, Bacon initially settled in Jamestown, the capital. By 1675 Bacon was himself appointed to the governor&#x27;s council. Berkeley&#x27;s wife, the former Frances Culpeper, may also have been Bacon&#x27;s cousin by marriage.

== Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion ==
Before the &quot;Virginia Rebellion&quot; (as it came to be called) began in earnest in 1674, some freeholders on the Virginian frontier demanded that Native Americans, including those in friendly tribes living on treaty-protected lands, should be driven out or killed. Historians have noted that the hatred among the settlers towards the Native Americans is a historically underrepresented catalyst of Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, as the rebellion was equally about &quot;violently [displacing] Indians&quot; and &quot;[exploiting] that hatred&quot; as it was about changing frontier policy in Virginia. They also protested against corruption in the government of Governor Berkeley, which has been described as &quot;incorrigibly corrupt, inhumanely oppressive, and inexcusably inefficient, especially in war&quot;.

Predating Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, the Anglo-Powhatan Wars instituted the distinct hierarchical separation and selfishness between the Indians and the Virginians that would eventually mold into the basis for the subduing of the Indians during Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion. Following a raid by Doeg Indians in Stafford County, Virginia, which resulted in the deaths of two white settlers associated with a trader named Thomas Mathew (whom later reports found regularly &quot;cheated and abused&quot; Indians), a group of Virginia militiamen raided settlements of the Susquehannock tribe, instead of the Doeg tribe, including some across the Potomac River in Maryland. Maryland Governor Calvert protested against the incursion, and the Susquehannocks retaliated. Maryland militia under Major Thomas Trueman then joined Virginia forces (now led by John Washington and Isaac Allerton), and attacked a fortified Susquehannock village. After five chiefs accepted the Maryland leader&#x27;s invitation to parley, they were slaughtered, an action which provoked later legislative investigations and reprimands. The Susquehannocks retaliated in force against plantations, killing 60 settlers in Maryland and a further 36 in their first assault on Virginia soil. Then other tribes joined in, killing settlers, burning houses and fields and slaughtering livestock as far as the James and York rivers.

Seeking to avoid a larger conflict similar to King Philip&#x27;s War in New England, Berkeley advocated containment, proposing the construction of several defensive fortifications along the frontier and urging frontier settlers to gather in a defensive posture. Frontier settlers dismissed the plan as expensive and inadequate, and also suspected that it might be a pretext for raising tax rates.

In the meantime, Bacon owned two large plantations along the James River. This main plantation called &quot;Curles&quot; (about 1000 acres, although only a third cleared since it was formed by others circa 1630, and by now worked by a dozen slaves) was on a peninsula formed by a bend of the James River (hence its name). Another plantation was significantly upstream, near the falls of the James River at Shockoe Creek, and had more cattle. Indian raiders killed Bacon&#x27;s overseer on that upriver plantation, and Bacon soon emerged as a rebel leader. When Berkeley refused to grant Bacon a military commission to attack all Indians, Bacon mustered his own force of 400–500 men and moved up the James River to attack the Doeg and Pamunkey tribes. Although both had generally lived peaceably with the colonists, and had not attacked the frontier settlements, their cultivated lands were valuable.

In March, Berkeley had attempted to secure warriors from the Pamunkey tribe to fight hostile tribes pursuant to earlier treaties. The Pamunkey queen Cockacoeske passionately reminded the Governor&#x27;s Council of the deaths 20 years ago of her husband and 100 warriors whom they had provided in a similar situation. The chairman had ignored her complaint, and instead continued to demand more warriors, receiving a promise in return to supply a dozen. Berkeley did arrest Bacon and remove him from the council, but Bacon&#x27;s men quickly secured his release, and forced Berkeley to hold legislative elections. Meanwhile, Bacon&#x27;s men continued their offensive against the Pamunkeys, who fled into Dragon Swamp. When the friendly Occoneechee managed to capture a Susquehannock fort, Bacon&#x27;s forces demanded all the spoils, although they had not assisted in the fighting. They then attacked the Oconeechee by treachery, killing 100 to 400 men, women and children.

Despite Bacon&#x27;s outlaw status, voters of Henrico County elected him and his mentor James Crewes to the recomposed House of Burgesses. That body enacted a number of sweeping reforms, limiting the governor&#x27;s powers and restoring suffrage rights to landless freemen. They also made the sale of any arms to any Indian punishable by execution. Bacon&#x27;s followers were unmollified, accusing Berkeley of refusing to authorize retaliation against natives to protect his own fur-trading investments and the monopolies which he had granted to his favorites. After a number of verbal altercations, including a quarrel in a Jamestown street, Berkeley retreated to his plantation and signed the military commission Bacon demanded. Scouting parties accordingly set out to requisition supplies, as well as to kill and enslave Indians, prompting protests from citizens of Gloucester County who were subject to the militia&#x27;s exactions. Bacon&#x27;s forces retreated to Middle Plantation (later renamed Williamsburg).

On July 30, 1676, Bacon and his makeshift army issued a &quot;Declaration of the People&quot;, which criticized Berkeley&#x27;s administration, accusing him of levying unfair taxes, appointing friends to high positions, and failing to protect outlying farmers from Indian attack. They also issued a &#x27;Manifesto&#x27; urging the &quot;extirpation&quot; of all Indians, asserting that they did not deserve legal protections because they &quot;have bin for these Many years enemies to the King and Country, Robbers and Thieves and Invaders of his Majesty&#x27;s Right and our Interest and Estate&quot;. Months of conflict ensued, including a naval attempt across the Potomac and in Chesapeake Bay by Bacon&#x27;s allies to capture Berkeley at Accomac. Bacon himself focused on the Pamunkey in Dragon Swamp; his forces seized 3 horse-loads of goods, enslaved 45 Indians and killed many more, prompting the queen Cockacoeske (who narrowly escaped with her son) to throw herself on the mercy of the Governor&#x27;s Council. Berkeley raised his own army of mercenaries on the Eastern Shore, and also captured Bacon&#x27;s naval allies and executed the two leaders. Bacon&#x27;s forces then turned against the colony&#x27;s capital, burning Jamestown to the ground on September 19, 1676.

Before a Royal Navy squadron could arrive, Bacon died of dysentery on October 26, 1676. Although John Ingram took control of the rebel forces, the rebellion soon collapsed. Governor Berkeley returned to power, seizing the property of several rebels and ultimately hanging twenty-three men, many without trial. After an investigative committee returned its report to King Charles II, which criticized both Berkeley and Bacon for their conduct toward friendly tribes, Berkeley was relieved of the governorship, returned to England to protest, and died shortly thereafter. Charles II later supposedly commented, &quot;That old fool has put to death more people in that naked country than I did here for the murder of my father.&quot; This may be a colonial myth, arising about 30 years later.

== Legacy ==

Despite recent historians&#x27; views of the conflict, many in the early United States, including Thomas Jefferson, saw Bacon as a patriot and believed that Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion was a prelude to the later American Revolution against the control of the Crown. This understanding of the conflict was reflected in twentieth-century commemorations, including a memorial window in Colonial Williamsburg, and a prominent tablet in the Virginia House of Delegates chamber of the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, which recalls Bacon as &quot;A great Patriot Leader of the Virginia People who died while defending their rights October 26, 1676.&quot;

<text>Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion was an armed rebellion by Virginia settlers that took place from 1676 to 1677. It was led by Nathaniel Bacon against Colonial Governor William Berkeley, after Berkeley refused Bacon&#x27;s request to drive Native American Indians out of Virginia. Thousands of Virginians from all classes (including those in indentured servitude) and races rose up in arms against Berkeley, chasing him from Jamestown and ultimately torching the settlement. The rebellion was first suppressed by a few armed merchant ships from London whose captains sided with Berkeley and the loyalists. 

Government forces led by Herbert Jeffreys arrived soon after and spent several years defeating pockets of resistance and reforming the colonial government to be once more under direct Crown control. While the rebellion did not succeed in the initial goal of driving the Native Americans from Virginia, it did result in Berkeley being recalled to England, where he died shortly thereafter.

Bacon&#x27;s rebellion was the first rebellion in the North American colonies in which discontented frontiersmen took part. A somewhat similar uprising in Maryland involving John Coode and Josias Fendall took place in 1689. The alliance between European indentured servants and Africans (a mix of indentured, enslaved, and Free Negroes) disturbed the colonial upper class. They responded by hardening the racial caste of slavery in an attempt to divide the two races from subsequent united uprisings with the passage of the Virginia Slave Codes of 1705. 
== Prelude ==
Starting in the 1650s, when high tobacco prices encouraged both tobacco planting and immigration, colonists began cutting forests as well as trying to farm tobacco on land already cleared by Native Americans. Whereas decades earlier, Native Americans had been able to trade foodstuffs which they had grown and captured for trade goods, colonists had learned to farm grain and raise livestock for themselves; furs (caught and prepared by natives or frontiersmen) became the new primary trade good. Tensions arose because native croplands were not only attractive to the colonists&#x27; generally free-roving pigs (which damaged their crops), but easily switched to tobacco. Because colonists&#x27; farming methods drained fields of nutrients (both because of erosion and because fertilization was rarely practiced or effective for more than another century), new fields were constantly sought. Furthermore, more emigrants were surviving their indentures and thus wanted to establish themselves with their new skills as tobacco farmers. In Virginia&#x27;s Northern Neck (a relatively undeveloped area in the watersheds of the Rappahannock River and Potomac Rivers between cleared and farmed land in southeastern Virginia and cleared and farmed land in eastern Maryland), rather than rent farmland from their former employers, freed indentured servants and other European immigrants began clearing and squatting on land that the Crown had reserved for Native Americans since 1634. However, with the Restoration of the English monarchy following the English Civil War, fewer people chose to emigrate from England to flee that internal conflict. Between the First Anglo-Dutch War and the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Crown adopted Navigation Acts, in particular a new rule that tobacco grown in the colonies could be sold only to English merchants and shipped to England on English ships. Since much colonial tobacco was of low quality and usually sold to Dutch traders or to the Continental market, English merchants had an oversupply of tobacco by the mid-1600s, and its price plummeted. Thus, while the Dutch had paid three pence per pound for tobacco and a small planter could grow 1000 pounds in a year, English traders would pay only a half penny per pound or less.

Virginia&#x27;s governor, William Berkeley, had taken office and sailed to the colony shortly before the English Civil War began, and remained in office or with significant power for about 35 years. Berkeley had traveled back to England to fight (unsuccessfully) for King Charles before returning to the colony in 1645 after Natives had massacred settlers in 1644. He led military forces which captured the chief Opechancanough and suppressed the revolt. Berkeley also had a royal monopoly of the important beaver fur trade and charged fur traders in the interior a license fee for bringing furs which they or Native Americans gathered and which the traders then sold to Berkeley&#x27;s company. Berkeley grew unpopular after the Dutch were defeated, in part because the tobacco boom had ended, as well as because of the conflict and more personal reasons. Like King Charles, Berkeley refused to call for legislative elections for more than a decade during the English Civil Wars (during part of which Puritan-leaning Richard Bennett, Edward Digges and Samuel Mathews had replaced him as the colony&#x27;s chief executive during the &quot;Long Assembly&quot;). He also issued large land grants to favorites (of 2000, 10,000 or even 30,000 acres) and was extremely wealthy compared to small planters (owning Green Spring Plantation outside Jamestown, as well as 5 houses in the colonial capital which he mostly rented out, 400 cattle and 60 horses, as well as several hundred sheep, valuable household silver and nearly a thousand pounds sterling worth of grain in storage). Berkeley&#x27;s favorites often commanded the local militia in various counties, as well as charging quitrents to smaller farmers who cleared and farmed the land on their vast estates. In 1662 Governor Berkeley warned English officials that the low tobacco prices did not even cover freight and customs charges, much less provide a subsistence income for small farmers, who grew discontent, and in 1667 several weather events caused the tobacco crop to fail. Nonetheless, after the Restoration of the monarchy, the king granted English-based favorites the Northern Neck Proprietary and the right to 11 years&#x27; worth of quitrents in arrears (which seemed like additional taxes). Discontent had become widespread by 1670, when most landless taxpayers lost the right to vote for representatives in the House of Burgesses. One set of aggrieved petitioners met at Lawne&#x27;s Creek parish church across from Jamestown in December 1673, and in 1674 two rebellions in Virginia failed for want of leaders.

Meanwhile, Susquehannock peoples from Pennsylvania and northern Maryland had been displaced by the peoples aligned with the Iroquois Confederation and moved south into Maryland (where they were initially welcomed) and Virginia. Secocowon (then known as Chicacoan), Doeg, Patawomeck and Rappahannock natives began moving into the Northern Neck region as they were displaced from Maryland as well as rapidly settling areas of eastern Virginia, and joined local tribes in defending their land and resources. In June 1666, Governor Berkeley told General Robert Smith of Rappahanock County that Native Americans in the colony&#x27;s northern part could be destroyed, in order to provide a &quot;great Terror and Example and Instruction to all other Indians&quot;, and that an expedition against them could be funded by enslaving the women and children and selling them outside the colony. Allowing enslavement of Indians for damages done to frontiersman had been permitted by the General Assembly in the case of John Powell of Northumberland County. Thus, soon colonists declared war on the nearby natives. By 1669, colonists had patented the land on the west of the Potomac as far north as My Lord&#x27;s Island (now Theodore Roosevelt Island in Washington, D.C.). By 1670, they had driven most of the Doeg out of the Virginia colony and into Maryland, apart from those living beside the Nanzatico/Portobago in Caroline County, Virginia.

== Motives ==

Bacon&#x27;s rebellion was motivated by both class and ethnic conflict.

On the one hand, the Rebellion featured a coalition of both black and white laborers, including women, against the Virginia aristocracy represented by Governor Berkeley.

At the same time, the primary policy disagreement between Bacon and Berkeley was in how to handle the Native American population, with Bacon favoring harsher measures. Berkeley believed that it would be useful to keep some as subjects, stating, &quot;I would have preserved those Indians that I knew were hoeurly at our mercy to have beene our spies and intelligence to find out the more bloudy Ennimies&quot;, whereas Bacon found this approach too compassionate, stating, &quot;Our Design [is] ... to ruin and extirpate all Indians in General.&quot;

===Native American raids===

In July 1675, Doeg Indians in Stafford County, Virginia, killed two settlers and destroyed fields of corn and cattle. The Stafford County militia tracked down the raiders, killing 10 Doeg in a cabin. Meanwhile, another militia, led by Colonel Mason and Captain George Brent, attacked a nearby cabin of the friendly Susquehannock tribe and killed 14 of them. The attack ceased only when someone from the cabin managed to escape and confront Mason, telling him that they were not Doegs. On August 31, Virginia Governor William Berkeley proclaimed that the Susquehannock had been involved in the Stafford County attack with the Doeg. On September 26, 1,000 members of Maryland militia led by Major Thomas Trueman marched to the Susquehannock stronghold in Maryland. They were soon joined by Virginia militia led by Col. John Washington and Col. Isaac Allerton Jr. Trueman invited five Susquehannock chiefs to a parley. After the chiefs denied responsibility for the July attacks in Stafford County despite witnesses having noticed Susquehannocks wearing clothing of some murdered settlers, they were killed without trial and despite the parley promises as well as a medal of Lord Baltimore and paper pledge from a former Maryland governor produced by one of the chiefs. Although the tribesmen in the fort continued to resist despite their leaders&#x27; unexplained disappearance, many ultimately managed to escape with their wives and children. Maryland authorities impeached Major Trueman, and Governor Berkeley expressed outrage when he heard about the massacre.

In January 1676, Susquehannocks retaliated by attacking plantations, killing 60 settlers in Maryland and a further 36 in Virginia. Other tribes joined in, killing settlers, burning houses and fields and slaughtering livestock as far south as the James and York River watersheds.

===Berkeley&#x27;s forts and Bacon&#x27;s raiders===

After raids in Virginia in February 1676, Berkeley initially called up the Virginia militia under Sir Henry Chicheley and Col. Goodrich to pursue the raiders but soon recalled that expedition and decided upon a defensive war. The House of Burgesses approved of Berkeley&#x27;s plan to build and staff eight forts along the frontier with 500 men, provided for the enlistment of friendly natives, and prohibited selling firearms to &quot;savages&quot;. When no militia deaths were reported in April and May, Berkeley proclaimed his plan a success, but Bacon&#x27;s people complained that garrisons could not pursue raiders without the governor&#x27;s express permission, and meanwhile outlying plantations were burned, livestock stolen, and settlers killed or taken captive. Frontier planters demanded the right to defend themselves. Bacon later attributed these actions to Berkeley&#x27;s desire not to impede the beaver fur trade, but historians also note that militia were often unwilling to distinguish between friendly and unfriendly natives. Upset at Governor Berkeley&#x27;s refusal to retaliate against the Native Americans&#x27; raids, farmers in Charles City County gathered near Merchant&#x27;s Hope on the James River, the scene of a massacre in 1622 upon hearing rumors of a new raiding party. Nathaniel Bacon arrived with a quantity of brandy; after it was distributed, he was elected leader.

Against Berkeley&#x27;s previous order, and as Bacon sought a commission to go and attack Indians, his armed militiamen crossed the Chickahominy River into New Kent County nominally seeking the Susquehannock warriors responsible for recent raids and so traveled first toward the Pamunkey lands, only to find the people had fled into Dragon Swamp. They then continued westward toward the Seneca Trail, a travel and trading path along the Appalachian Mountains. Governor Berkeley was furious that Bacon&#x27;s militia had driven the Pamunkeys into hiding and declared the action illegal and rebellious, notwithstanding Bacon&#x27;s letter ordering payment of money he owed the governor and reiterating that he had no evil intentions against the government nor him. However, not finding Susquehannocks, Bacon&#x27;s militiamen turned their back upon settlements and struck south until they came to the Roanoke River and the Occaneechi people in May. After convincing Occaneechi warriors (and their Mannikin allies) to leave their villages and attack the Susquehannock to the west, Bacon and his men refused to pay for those services but instead demanded provisions and beaver pelts. Not receiving them, they murdered the Occaneechi chief and most of the Occaneechi men, women, and children, which ranged from 100 to 400 people, remaining at the villages, then plundered their larders before proceeding eastward back toward Jamestown. Meanwhile, Berkeley had gathered about 300 men and led them to the falls of the James River (modern day Richmond), but too late to intercept Bacon&#x27;s forces. So, he issued another proclamation declaring Bacon and his followers as unlawful, mutinous and rebellious, and his wife issued her own proclamation that Bacon&#x27;s promises to provide for his follower&#x27;s wives and children only promoted vain hopes. Lady Berkeley declared that Bacon owed his trading partner William Byrd I 400 pounds sterling and his cousin Nathaniel Bacon Sr. 200 pounds sterling and that his own father had refused to honor his bills of exchange.

===Returning to Jamestown===

Upon returning to their lands in Henrico County, Bacon&#x27;s faction discovered that Berkeley had called for new elections to the House of Burgesses to better address the Native American raids and other matters. Ignoring the sheriff&#x27;s reading of Berkeley&#x27;s proclamation against Bacon, voters elected Bacon and his friend Capt. James Crews to represent them in the House of Burgesses. However, when Bacon and 40 of his armed followers attempted to dock their sloop at Jamestown, they were fired on by the fort, and so disembarked under cover of darkness to consult with followers Richard Lawrence and William Drummond at a tavern. However, he was discovered returning to his sloop, chased upriver, and forced to surrender to Capt. Thomas Gardiner of the warship &quot;Adam and Eve&quot;. Upon being taken to the Governor, Bacon behaved as a gentleman and was granted leniency—parole upon signing a paper promising to refrain from further disobedience to the government, then allowed to plead his submission before the Governor&#x27;s Council.
Despite most new members being sympathetic to Bacon&#x27;s grievances, Governor Berkeley at first exerted control over the newly elected House of Burgesses. Berkeley first insisted upon the legislature taking care of Indian business, but a debate as to whether the House would ask for two Councillors to sit with the committee on Indian Affairs never came to a vote, and the Queen of the Pamunkeys demanded compensation for the former war in which her husband had been killed assisting the English as a precondition to furnishing warriors in this conflict, although ultimately the burgesses authorized an army of 1000 men. The recomposed House of Burgesses ultimately enacted a number of sweeping reforms, known as Bacon&#x27;s Laws discussed below. However, by this time Bacon had escaped Jamestown, telling Berkeley that his own wife was ill, but soon placing himself at the head of a volunteer army in Henrico County, where natives had renewed raids and killed 8 settlers, including wiping out families.

Bacon returned to Jamestown with hundreds of enraged followers demanding &quot;no levies&quot; (meaning no additional taxes nor military conscription). Bacon demanded a military commission to lead forces against the Indians, as well as blank commissions for his officers. Governor Berkeley, however, initially refused to yield to the pressure, rushing out to meet Bacon in the street and declaring him a traitor. When Bacon had his men take aim at Berkeley, he responded by &quot;baring his breast&quot; and told Bacon to shoot him. Seeing that the governor would not be moved, Bacon then had his men take aim at the burgesses viewing the street spectacle from the windows of nearby houses. When the burgesses invited Bacon into their Long Room, the governor yielded and signed the military commissions, as well as wrote the King justifying Bacon&#x27;s conduct. The assembly in Bacon&#x27;s absence had also rushed through &quot;Bacon&#x27;s Laws&quot;, possibly drafted by Lawrence and Drummond, or by Thomas Blayton (whom Edward Hill later called &quot;Bacon&#x27;s great engine&quot; in the assembly). Although repealed by the burgesses in the 1677 session, they limited the governor&#x27;s powers, set certain fees for governmental actions, made it illegal for one person to hold more than one important county office at one time (the offices being sheriff, clerk of court, surveyor and escheator) and restored suffrage to landless freemen (including in taxes levied by county courts and vestries).

===Rival recruiting attempts and the &quot;Declaration of the People&quot;===

In late July, Bacon completed preparations for his Indian campaign, including enlisting officers and armed bands from many counties, which were to meet at the falls of the James River. Bacon addressed seven hundred gathered horse and six hundred gathered foot troops, took the oath of allegiance and expected to march the next day, only to learn that Philip Ludwell and Robert Beverley were recruiting other troops on behalf of Governor Berkeley in Gloucester County to their rear, alleging that Bacon&#x27;s commission was illegal because it had been procured by force, but the troops refused to gather for the governor upon learning they were to oppose the popular hero Bacon. On July 30, 1676, Bacon and his army issued the &quot;Declaration of the People&quot;. The declaration criticized Berkeley&#x27;s administration in detail. It leveled several accusations against Berkeley:
# that &quot;upon specious pretense of public works [he] raised great unjust taxes upon the commonality&quot;;
# that he advanced favorites to high public offices;
# that he monopolized the beaver trade with the Native Americans;
# that he was pro-Native American.

Berkeley then followed Robert Beverley&#x27;s advice and fled across Chesapeake Bay to Accomack County on Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Shore. Chicheley promised to meet him shortly thereafter, but was captured. Bacon and his followers established a camp at Middle Plantation (modern Williamsburg) and issued a proclamation declaring Berkeley, Chicheley, Ludwell, Beverley and others traitors, as well as threatened to confiscate their estates unless they surrendered within four days. Bacon also summoned all the leading planters to a conference. Seventy assembled and 69 took three oaths: (1) that they would join with him against the Indians, (2) that they would arrest anyone trying to raise troops against him, and (3) (with demurrers) that they would oppose any English troops sent to Virginia until Bacon could plead his case before the King. Among the oath&#x27;s signers were burgesses or councillors Thomas Swan, John Page, Philip Lightfoot and Thomas Ballard. Meanwhile, Bacon&#x27;s father, Thomas Bacon, was pleading with the King to pardon his son, presenting &quot;The Virginians&#x27; Plea&quot;.

Bacon then led his army through upper Gloucester and Middlesex Counties against the Pamunkey, finding a village in the swamps and capturing 45 prisoners (although the queen of the Pamunkeys escaped) as well as stores of wampum, skins, fur and English goods. Meanwhile, on August 1, Bacon&#x27;s followers Giles Bland and William Carver captured a ship &#x27;Rebecca&quot; commanded by Captain Larrimore and refitted her with guns, although two other ships escaped. Bland and Carver and 250 men with three ships then attempted to block the mouth of the James River, but ended up anchoring off Accomac, where Captain Larrimore sent a message to Governor Berkeley about serving with his crew under duress, so Philip Ludwell and two boats of soldiers sailed out and recaptured the ship. Berkeley then embarked 200 men on two ships and six or seven sloops and returned to the Western Sore, sailing up the James River toward Jamestown, where Bacon&#x27;s garrison fled without firing a shot.

===Burning of Jamestown, further raids, courts martial and Bacon&#x27;s death===
When Bacon&#x27;s forces again reached Jamestown, it seemed impregnable, approachable only via a narrow isthmus defended by three heavy guns. Nonetheless, Bacon ordered a crude fortification constructed at the end of the isthmus, and when Berkeley&#x27;s forces fired on the crude structure, sent out parties of horse troops to gather the wives of some of the governor&#x27;s supporters. Thus, Elizabeth Page, Angelica Bray, Anna Ballard, Frances Thorpe and Elizabeth Bacon (wife of his senior cousin) were placed on the ramparts together with some Native American prisoners, to be endangered should firing resume. On September 15, some of Berkeley&#x27;s troops sallied out, but without success, so Berkeley&#x27;s Councillors advised abandoning the town. They spiked the guns, took stores aboard vessels and slipped down the river at night. Bacon&#x27;s forces thus retook the town. However, Bacon also learned that his former follower, Giles Brent had raised an army in the northern counties and was marching south to attack Bacon and his men. Thus, Bacon, Lawrence, Drummond and others decided to torch Jamestown, the colony&#x27;s capital, on September 19.

After Bacon&#x27;s followers torched the capital and left their encampment at Berkeley&#x27;s Green Spring Plantation outside Jamestown, the main body traveled east to Yorktown. They then crossed the York River and encamped in Gloucester County at Warner Hall, home of the speaker of the House of Burgesses, Augustine Warner Jr. However, the Gloucester troops balked at further oaths. This disappointed Bacon, so he arrested Rev. James Wadding, who had tried to dissuade the people from subscribing. Bacon also set up courts martial to try some of this opponents, or exchange them for Carver and Bland, but only executed one deserter.
Bacon also sent Captain George Farlow (formerly one of Cromwell&#x27;s men) and 40 soldiers to capture Governor Berkeley at the plantation of council member John Custis in Accomack County on Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Shore, but the raid failed, and Farloe was captured and hanged. Nor was a manifesto to the people of the Eastern Shore effective. Thus, Bacon issued orders that the estates of the governor and his friends be ransacked to supply his army. Taking cattle, sheep, hogs, Indian corn and household furnishings, Bacon&#x27;s soldiers seemed to plunder both friend and foe, eroding his support. Bacon made his final headquarters at the house of Major Thomas Pate, in Gloucester County a few miles east of West Point, but fell ill of dysentery and after calling in Rev. Wadding for last rites, died on October 26, 1676. His body was never found; upon being exhumed on Berkeley&#x27;s orders, the casket contained only stones.

==Suppression==

Bacon and his rebels never encountered a Crown force consisting of 1,000 English Army troops led by Colonel Herbert Jeffreys transported by a Royal Navy squadron under the command of Thomas Larimore sent to aid Berkeley. Neither Lawrence nor Drummond had military experience, and Giles Bland who had such experience was already Berkeley&#x27;s prisoner, having been captured along with Carver during the failed kidnapping attempt. Thus, the remaining rebels elected John Ingram, Bacon&#x27;s second in command but a saddler by trade, as their leader. However, he faced daunting problems in feeding his men, as well as the militarily strategic need to cover hundreds of thousands of acres of land with many vulnerable areas.

The rebellion did not last long after that. Ingram kept his main force at the head of the York River, with small garrisons at strategic points—including Governor Berkeley&#x27;s residence at Green Spring and Major Arthur Allen&#x27;s across the James River (at what came to be called Bacon&#x27;s Castle though Bacon had never lived there), as well as Colonel West&#x27;s house near West Point, Councillor Bacon&#x27;s house at King&#x27;s Creek and Yorktown (both on the York River) as well as Col. John Washington&#x27;s house in Westmoreland County to the north. Berkeley launched a series of successful amphibious attacks across the Chesapeake Bay and defeated the small pockets of insurgents spread across Tidewater Virginia. Major Beverley captured Captain Thomas Hansford and his Yorktown garrison, then returned to capture Major Edmund Cheesemen and Capt. Thomas Wilford.

However, Berkeley&#x27;s forces also suffered losses. A planned surprise raid on the York River garrison at King&#x27;s Creek ended with the death of its leader, Capt. Hubert Farril. Major Lawrence Smith had gathered loyalists in Gloucester county, but when they faced Ingram&#x27;s forces, Major Bristow offered single combat in the medieval style, and the loyalists&#x27; rank and file laid down their arms and went home. Another large force gathered in Middlesex County but dispersed after Ingram sent out Gregory Wakelett and a body of horse troops. Thus, Berkeley&#x27;s plan to close in on Ingram from the south of the York River, while other loyalists attacked from the north and east failed miserably.

In November 1676, the Royal Navy arrived. Thomas Grantham, captain of the ship &quot;Concord&quot; cruised the York River, despite pleas from Lawrence about the people having been grievously oppressed and requests to remain neutral. Grantham tried to persuade Berkeley to use meekness, which Berkeley soon used to good effect, but insisted that the pardons not be allowed to Lawrence and Drummond. Grantham then went up the York River to the Pate house at West Point, and used cunning and force to disarm the rebels there. Ingram yielded the West Point garrison with 300 men, four great guns and many small arms, then Grantham tricked his way into the rebel garrison at John West&#x27;s house with a barrel of brandy and promises of pardon. However, after surrendering the post with 3 cannon, 500 muskets and fowling pieces and 1000 pounds of bullets, and once they were safely in the hold, he turned the ship&#x27;s guns on them and disarmed the rebels. Berkeley invited Ingram and Langston to dine with him on shipboard, after their surrender at Tindall&#x27;s Point, after the men had toasted the King and governor, they were allowed to disperse. Then to secure the submission of Gregory Wakelett&#x27;s cavalry, Berkeley offered not only a pardon, but part of the wampum Bacon&#x27;s former men had taken from the Indians.

Lawrence, Whaley and three others fled westward, risking torture at the hands of natives rather than fall into the governor&#x27;s control. They were last seen pushing through the snow on the extreme frontier, and may have died of hunger and exposure, or found refuge in some other colony. Drummond was found hiding in Chickahominy Swamp.

== Aftermath ==

Although rebel forces were suppressed, the colony was in a deplorable condition, with many plantations deserted or plundered. The government lacked money, and the absence of labor had resulted in small harvests of both tobacco and grain. Nonetheless, at year&#x27;s end, tobacco ships began to come in with supplies of clothing, cloth, medicines, and sundries.

===Trials and executions===

Executions continued for several months. Berkeley acknowledged executing 13 rebels. While his headquarters remained on the Eastern Shore, Berkeley condemned many rebels and executed five. Hansford pleaded that he be shot as a soldier not hanged like a dog, and protested his loyalty as he stood on the scaffold. Major Cheeseman died in prison, though his wife pleaded that she be hung in his place. Farloe produced his military commission and was told that it authorized fighting only against Indians, not the Governor, and so was also executed, as were Carver, Wilford, and John Johnson.

The 71-year-old governor Berkeley returned to the burned capital and his looted Green Spring home at the end of January 1677. His wife described their Green Spring Plantation in a letter to her cousin:

It looked like one of those the boys pull down at Shrovetide, and was almost as much to repair as if it had been new to build, and no sign that ever there had been a fence around it...

Thomas Young, James Wilson (&quot;Harris&quot; per Berkeley), Henry Page and Thomas Hall were executed on January 12, 1677. Then William Drummond and John Baptista (the latter not mentioned by Berkeley) were tried at Middle Plantation (Williamsburg) not far from Green Spring and executed on January 20. James Crewes, William Cookson and John Digbie (&quot;Darby&quot; being named as a former servant in Berkeley&#x27;s list) were tried at Jamestown and hanged on January 24.

However, despite receiving orders to return to England, Berkeley delayed his departure for several months, during which he presided over additional trials, apparently disregarding the clemency suggested by the royal representatives. Bacon&#x27;s wealthy landowning followers returned their loyalty to the Virginia government after Bacon&#x27;s death. Some former rebels of lower classes were ordered to make public apologies, and many were fined or ordered to pay court costs. The childless, elderly Governor&#x27;s seizing property of several (but not all) rebels for the colony provoked considerable unrest and dissatisfaction. However, whereas in the initial trials many of the accused were denied counsel, such were present in several of the later trials. Berkeley in particular grew displeased with his former King&#x27;s Counsel, William Sherwood for defending former rebels. Former customs collector Giles Bland and Anthony Arnold were executed on March 8, then John Isles and Richard Pomfrey on March 15 and John Whitson and William Scarburgh on March 16. Scholars differ as to the number of men executed, although roughly double the number in Berkeley&#x27;s report. One scholar counted 25 executions another states 23 men were executed by hanging.

===Royal commission and Berkeley&#x27;s death===

Meanwhile, after an investigative committee returned its report to King Charles II, Berkeley was relieved of the governorship and recalled to England. According to one historian, &quot;Because the tobacco trade generated a crown revenue of about £5–£10 per laboring man, King Charles II wanted no rebellion to distract the colonists from raising the crop.&quot; Charles II was reported to have commented, &quot;That old fool has put to death more people in that naked country than I did here for the murder of my father.&quot; No record of the king&#x27;s comments have been found, and the origin of the story appears to have been colonial legend that arose at least 30 years after the events. The king prided himself on the clemency he had shown to his father&#x27;s enemies. Berkeley left his wife, Frances Berkeley, in Virginia and returned to England. She sent a letter to let him know that the current governor was making a bet that the king would refuse to receive him. However, William Berkeley died in July 1677, shortly after he landed in England.

=== Resolution by Herbert Jeffreys ===
In November 1676, Herbert Jeffreys was appointed by Charles II as a lieutenant governor of Virginia colony and arrived in Virginia in February 1677. During Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, Jeffreys was commander-in-chief of the regiment of six warships carrying over 1,100 troops, tasked with quelling and pacifying the rebellion upon their arrival. He served as leader of a three-member commission (alongside Sir John Berry and Francis Moryson) to inquire into the causes of discontent and political strife in the colony. The commission published a report for the King titled &quot;A True Narrative of the Rise, Progresse, and Cessation of the late Rebellion in Virginia,&quot; which provided an official report and history of the insurrection.

On 27 April 1677, with the support of the King, Jeffreys assumed the role of acting colonial governor following Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, succeeding Berkeley. Shortly after Jeffreys took over as acting governor, Berkeley angrily remarked that Jeffreys had an &quot;irresistible desire to rule this country&quot; and that his action could not be justified. He wrote to Jeffreys, &quot;I believe that the inhabitants of this Colony will quickly find a difference between your management and mine.&quot;

As acting governor, Jeffreys was responsible for appeasing the remaining factions of resistance and reforming the colonial government to be once more under direct Crown control. Jeffreys presided over the Treaty of 1677, the formal peace treaty between the Crown and representatives from various Virginia Native American tribes that was signed on 28 May 1677. In October 1677, Jeffreys persuaded the Virginia General Assembly to pass an act of amnesty for all of the participants in Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, and levied fines against any citizen of the colony that called another a &quot;traitor&quot; or &quot;rebel.&quot; Jeffreys led efforts to rebuild and restore the state house and colonial capital of Jamestown which had been burned and looted during the rebellion.

===Historical disagreements===

In order for the Virginia elite to maintain the loyalty of the common planters in order to avert future rebellions, one historian commented, they &quot;needed to lead, rather than oppose, wars meant to dispossess and destroy frontier Indians.&quot; He elaborated that this bonded the elite to the common planter in wars against Indians, their common enemy, and enabled the elites to appease free whites with land. Taylor writes, &quot;To give servants greater hope for the future, in 1705 the assembly revived the headright system by promising each freedman fifty acres of land, a promise that obliged the government to continue taking land from the Indians.&quot;

Bacon promised his army tax breaks, predetermined wages, and freedom from indentures, &quot;so long as they should serve under his colors.&quot; Indentured servants both black and white had joined the frontier rebellion. Seeing them united in a cause alarmed the ruling class. Historians believe the rebellion hastened the hardening of racial lines associated with slavery, as a way for planters and the colony to control some of the poor. For example, historian Eric Foner writes, &quot;The fear of civil war among whites frightened Virginia&#x27;s ruling elite, who took steps to consolidate power and improve their image: for example, restoration of property qualifications for voting, reducing taxes, and adoption of a more aggressive American Indian policy.&quot; Some of these measures, by appeasing the poor white population, may have had the purpose of inhibiting any future unification with the enslaved black population.

== Historiography ==
In 1676, Ann Cotton wrote a personal account of Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion. Her account was in the form of a letter written in 1676 and published in its original form in 1804 in the &quot;Richmond Enquirer&quot; under the title, &quot;An account of our late troubles in Virginia&quot;. The following year, the same paper published &quot;The Beginning, Progress, and Conclusion of Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion&quot;, which former participant Thomas Mathew wrote in 1704 (the year before his death), and which had been acquired for President Thomas Jefferson, who gave his former mentor George Wythe permission to have it published.

Historians question whether the rebellion by Bacon against Berkeley in 1676 had any lasting significance for the more-successful American Revolution a century later. The most idolizing portrait of Bacon is found in &quot;Torchbearer of the Revolution&quot; (1940) by Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker, which one scholar in 2011 called &quot;one of the worst books on Virginia that a reputable scholarly historian ever published.&quot; The central area of debate is Bacon&#x27;s controversial character and complex disposition, as illustrated by Wilcomb E. Washburn&#x27;s &quot;The Governor and the Rebel&quot; (1957). Rather than singing Bacon&#x27;s praises and chastising Berkeley&#x27;s tyranny, Washburn found the roots of the rebellion in the colonists&#x27; intolerable demand to &quot;authorize the slaughter and dispossession of the innocent as well as the guilty.&quot;

More nuanced approaches on Berkeley&#x27;s supposed tyranny or mismanagement entertained specialist historians throughout the middle of the twentieth century, leading to a diversification of factors responsible for Virginia&#x27;s contemporary instability. Wesley Frank Craven in the 1968 publication, &quot;The Colonies in Transition&quot;, argues that Berkeley&#x27;s greatest failings took place during the revolt, near the end of his life. Bernard Bailyn pushed the novel thesis that it was a question of access to resources, a failure to fully transplant Old World society to New.

Edmund S. Morgan&#x27;s 1975 classic, &quot;American Slavery, American Freedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia&quot;, connected the calamity of Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, namely the potential for lower-class revolt, with the colony&#x27;s transition over to slavery, saying, &quot;But for those with eyes to see, there was an obvious lesson in the rebellion. Resentment of an alien race might be more powerful than resentment of an upper class. Virginians did not immediately grasp it. It would sink in as time went on.&quot;

James Rice&#x27;s 2012 narrative, &quot;Tales from a Revolution: Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion and the Transformation of Early America&quot;, whose emphasis on Bacon&#x27;s flaws echoes &quot;The Governor and the Rebel&quot;, integrates the rebellion into a larger story emphasizing the actions of multiple Native Americans, as well as placing it in the context of politics in Europe. In this telling, the climax of Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion comes with the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; of 1688/89.

== Legacy ==
According to the Historic Jamestowne website, &quot;For many years, historians considered the Virginia Rebellion of 1676 to be the first stirring of revolutionary sentiment in [North] America, which culminated in the American Revolution almost exactly one hundred years later. However, in the past few decades, based on findings from a more distant viewpoint, historians have come to understand Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion as a power struggle between two stubborn, selfish leaders rather than a glorious fight against tyranny.&quot;
Nonetheless, many in the early United States, including Thomas Jefferson, saw Bacon as a patriot and believed that Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion truly was a prelude to the later American Revolution against the control of the Crown. This understanding of the conflict was reflected in 20th-century commemorations, including a memorial window in Colonial Williamsburg and a prominent tablet in the Virginia House of Delegates chamber of the State Capitol in Richmond, which recalls Bacon as &quot;A great Patriot Leader of the Virginia People who died while defending their rights October 26, 1676.&quot; Subsequent to the rebellion, the Virginia colonial legislature enacted the Virginia Slave Codes of 1705, which created several strict laws upon people of African background. Additionally, the codes were intended to socially segregate the white and black races.

== Use of jimsonweed ==
Jimsonweed is a Deliriant plant that was first documented by a Virginian colonist named Robert Beverly. Robert Beverley reported, in his 1705 book on the history of Virginia, that some soldiers who had been dispatched to Jamestown to quell Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion gathered and ate leaves of &quot;Datura stramonium&quot; and spent eleven days acting in bizarre and foolish ways before recovering. After recovery from the plant the soldiers claimed to not remember anything from the past 11 days. This led to the plant being known as Jamestown weed, and later jimsonweed.

Described as a &quot;cooler&quot; by Robert Beverley but effects can be close to schizophrenia and dissociative disorder – which explains why soldiers acted irrationally, or &quot;went crazy&quot; for days.
