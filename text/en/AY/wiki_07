<text>Dorothy Jean Dandridge (November 9, 1922 – September 8, 1965) was an American actress and singer. She was the first African-American film star to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1954). Dandridge had also performed as a vocalist in venues such as the Cotton Club and the Apollo Theater. During her early career, she performed as a part of the Wonder Children, later the Dandridge Sisters, and appeared in a succession of films, usually in uncredited roles.

In 1959, Dandridge was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. She was the subject of the 1999 biographical film &quot;Introducing Dorothy Dandridge&quot;, with Halle Berry portraying her. She had been recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Dandridge was married and divorced twice, first to dancer Harold Nicholas (the father of her daughter, Harolyn Suzanne) and then to hotel owner Jack Denison. Dandridge died in 1965 at the age of 42.

== Early life ==
Dorothy Jean Dandridge was born in 1922 in Cleveland, Ohio to entertainer Ruby (née Butler) and Cyril Dandridge. Her father was a cabinetmaker and Baptist minister. Her parents separated before her birth.

Ruby created a song-and-dance act for her two young daughters, Vivian and Dorothy, under the name The Wonder Children. The act was managed by her lover, Geneva Williams. Williams was said to have had a bad temper and to have cruelly disciplined the children. The sisters toured the Southern United States almost nonstop for five years (rarely attending school), while Ruby worked and performed in Cleveland.

During the Great Depression, work virtually dried up for the Dandridges, as it did for many Chitlin&#x27; Circuit performers. Ruby moved her family to Hollywood, California, where she found steady work on radio and film in small domestic-servant parts. After that relocation, in 1930, Dorothy attended McKinley Junior High School.

The Wonder Children were renamed The Dandridge Sisters in 1934. Dandridge and her sister were teamed with dance schoolmate Etta Jones.

== Career ==

=== Beginnings ===
The Dandridge Sisters continued strong for several years, and they were booked in several high-profile New York nightclubs, including the Cotton Club and the Apollo Theater. Dandridge first appeared on screen at the age of 13 in a small part in an&quot; Our Gang&quot; comedy short, &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Beau&quot; in 1935. As a part of The Dandridge Sisters, she also appeared in &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1936&quot; (1936) with Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; with the Marx Brothers, and &quot;It Can&#x27;t Last Forever&quot; (both 1937) with the Jackson Brothers. Although these appearances were relatively minor, Dandridge continued to earn recognition through continuing her nightclub performances nationwide.

Dandridge&#x27;s first credited film role was in &quot;Four Shall Die&quot; (1940). The race film cast her as a murderer and did little for her film career. Because of her rejection of stereotypical black roles, she had limited options for film roles. She had small roles in &quot;Lady from Louisiana&quot; with John Wayne and &quot;Sundown&quot; with Gene Tierney, both in 1941.

Also that year, Dandridge appeared as part of the specialty number &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; in the hit 1941 musical &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot; for 20th Century Fox. The film marked the first time she performed with the Nicholas Brothers. Aside from her film appearances, Dandridge appeared in a succession of soundies – film clips that were displayed on jukeboxes, including &quot;Paper Doll&quot; by the Mills Brothers, &quot;Cow, Cow Boogie&quot;, &quot;Jig in the Jungle&quot;, and &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Carpenter&#x27;s Rent Party&quot; also called &quot;Swing for my Supper&quot;, among others. These films were noted not only for showcasing Dandridge as singer and dancer and her acting abilities, but also for featuring a strong emphasis on her physical attributes.

She appeared occasionally in films and on the stage throughout the rest of the 1940s and performed as a band singer in films with Count Basie in &quot;Hit Parade of 1943&quot; and Louis Armstrong, &quot;Atlantic City&quot; (1944) and &quot;Pillow to Post&quot; (1945). In 1944, Dandridge was featured as the star in &quot;Sweet &#x27;N Hot&quot;, a musical held at the Mayan theatre in Los Angeles and produced by Leon Hefflin Sr., which played nightly for 11 weeks. In 1951, Dandridge appeared as Melmendi, Queen of the Ashuba in &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Peril&quot;, starring Lex Barker and Virginia Huston. When the Motion Picture Production Code objected to the film&#x27;s &quot;blunt sexuality&quot;, Dandridge received considerable attention for wearing what was considered &quot;provocatively revealing&quot; clothing. The continuing publicity buzz surrounding Dandridge&#x27;s wardrobe got her featured on the April 1951 cover of &quot;Ebony&quot;. The same year, she had a supporting role in &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters&quot; (1951).

In May 1951, Dandridge had a spectacular opening at the Mocambo nightclub in West Hollywood, the biggest in its history. after assiduous coaching and decisions on style with pianist Phil Moore. This success seemed a new turn to her career, and she appeared in New York and at Café de Paris in London with equal success. In a return engagement at the Mocambo in December 1952, a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio agent saw Dandridge and recommended to production chief Dore Schary that she might make an appearance as a club singer, in her own name, in &quot;Remains to Be Seen&quot;, a film already in production. Her acquaintance with Dore Schary resulted in his casting Dandridge as Jane Richards in &quot;Bright Road&quot;—her first starring role, in which she expressed herself as a &quot;wonderful, emotional actress&quot;—which the trailer promoted. The film, which centered on a teacher&#x27;s struggles to reach a troubled student, marked the first time Dandridge appeared in a film opposite Harry Belafonte. She continued her performances in nightclubs and appeared on multiple early television variety shows, including Ed Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;.

=== &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; and 20th Century-Fox ===
In 1953, a talent search was conducted as 20th Century Fox began the process of casting an all-black musical film adaptation of Oscar Hammerstein II&#x27;s 1943 Broadway musical &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;. This production had updated Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot; to a World War II-era, African-American setting. In Dandridge&#x27;s leading role from the previous year, a school teacher in &quot;Bright Road&quot;, director and writer Otto Preminger could see no gift to portray the classic femme fatale in &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1954) but his consideration was that she would be suited for the smaller role, Cindy Lou. Dandridge, who had dressed down for the screen test of &quot;Bright Road&quot; to suit the demure teacher at its center, worked with Max Factor make-up artists to convey the look and character of the earthy Carmen, which she wore to a meeting with Preminger in his office. The effect, combined with some viewing suggested to him of her freer, looser appearances in the &quot;soundies&quot; material, assured her earning the production&#x27;s title role.

The remainder of the cast was completed with Harry Belafonte, Pearl Bailey, Brock Peters, Diahann Carroll, Madame Sul-Te-Wan (uncredited), Olga James, and Joe Adams.

Despite Dandridge&#x27;s recognition as a singer, the studio wanted an operatic voice, so Dandridge&#x27;s voice was dubbed by white mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne. &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; opened to favorable reviews and strong box-office returns on October 28, 1954, earning $70,000 during its first week and $50,000 during its second. Dandridge&#x27;s performance as the seductive Carmen made her one of Hollywood&#x27;s first African-American sex symbols and earned her positive reviews. On November 1, 1954, Dorothy Dandridge became the first black woman featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot;. Walter Winchell described her performance as &quot;bewitching&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it &quot;maintains the right hedonistic note throughout&quot;.

&quot;Carmen Jones&quot; became a worldwide success, eventually earning over $10 million at the box office and becoming one of the year&#x27;s highest-earning films. Dandridge was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first African American nominated for a leading role. At the 27th Academy Awards held on March 30, 1955, Dandridge was a nominee along with Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, Judy Garland, and Jane Wyman. Although Kelly won the award for her performance in &quot;The Country Girl&quot;, Dandridge became an overnight sensation. At the 1955 Oscar ceremony, Dandridge presented the Academy Award for Film Editing to &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; editor Gene Milford.

On February 15, 1955, Dandridge signed a three-movie deal with 20th Century Fox starting at $75,000 a film. Darryl F. Zanuck, the studio head, had suggested the studio sign Dandridge to a contract. Zanuck had big plans for her, hoping she would become the first African-American screen icon. He purchased the film rights to &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; and intended to cast her as saloon singer Lola-Lola in an all-black remake of the original 1930 film. She was scheduled to star as Cigarette in a remake of &quot;Under Two Flags&quot;. Meanwhile, Dandridge agreed to play the role of Tuptim in a film version of &quot;The King and I&quot; and a sultry upstairs neighbor in &quot;The Lieutenant Wore Skirts&quot;. However, her former director and now-lover Otto Preminger suggested she accept only leading roles. As an international star, Dorothy Dandridge rejected the two lesser roles, and Rita Moreno was cast in both roles.

On April 11, 1955, Dandridge became the first black performer to open at the Empire Room at New York&#x27;s Waldorf-Astoria hotel. Her success as a headliner led to the hotel booking other black performers, such as the Count Basie Orchestra with vocalist Joe Williams, Pearl Bailey, and Lena Horne.

=== Hollywood Research, Inc., trial ===
In 1957, Dandridge sued &quot;Confidential&quot; for libel over its article that described a scandalous incident that it claimed occurred in 1950. In May 1957, she accepted an out-of-court settlement of $10,000. 

Dandridge was one of two Hollywood stars who testified at the 1957 criminal libel trial of Hollywood Research, Inc., the company that published &quot;Confidential&quot; and other tabloid magazines from that era. Four months after her out-of-court settlement for $10,000, she and actress Maureen O&#x27;Hara, the only other star who testified at the criminal trial, were photographed shaking hands outside the downtown-Los Angeles courtroom where the highly publicized trial was held.

Testimony from O&#x27;Hara, as well as from a disgruntled former magazine editor named Howard Rushmore, revealed that the magazines published false information provided by hotel maids, clerks, and movie-theater ushers who were paid for their tips. The stories with questionable veracity most often centered around alleged incidents of casual sex. When the jury and press visited Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre to determine whether O&#x27;Hara could have performed various sexual acts while seated in the balcony, as reported by a magazine published by Hollywood Research, Inc., this was discovered to have been impossible.

Dandridge had not testified during her civil lawsuit earlier in 1957, but in September she gave testimony in the criminal trial that further strengthened the prosecution&#x27;s case. Alleged by &quot;Confidential&quot; to have fornicated with a white bandleader in the woods of Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in 1950, she testified that racial segregation had confined her to her hotel during her nightclub engagement in Lake Tahoe. When she was not in the hotel lounge rehearsing or performing her singing, according to her testimony, she was required to stay inside her room where she slept alone.

The trial ended in a mistrial. The judge ordered Hollywood Research to stop publishing questionable stories based on paid tips. This curtailed invasive tabloid journalism until 1971, when Generoso Pope, Jr. moved the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, which he owned, from New York to Lantana, Florida, where there were fewer restrictions.

== Later career ==
In 1957, after a three-year absence from film acting, Dandridge agreed to appear in the film &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; opposite an ensemble cast, including James Mason, Harry Belafonte, Joan Fontaine, Joan Collins, and Stephen Boyd. Dandridge portrayed a local West Indian shop clerk who has an interracial love affair with a white man, played by John Justin. The film was controversial for its time period, and the script was revised numerous times to accommodate the Motion Picture Production Code requirements about interracial relationships. Dandridge and Justin did have an extremely intimate, loving embrace that succeeded in not breaching the code. Despite the behind-the-scenes controversy, the film received favorable reviews and was one of the year&#x27;s biggest successes.

Dandridge next agreed to star opposite German actor Curd Jürgens in the French/Italian production of &quot;Tamango&quot; (1958). A reluctant Dandridge had agreed to appear in the film only after learning that it focused on a 19th-century slave revolt on a cargo ship traveling from Africa to Cuba. However, she nearly withdrew when the initial script called for her to swim in the nude and spend the majority of the film in a two-piece bathing suit made of rags. When Dandridge threatened to leave the film, the script and her wardrobe were retooled to her liking. As United States Production code requirements did not apply to the Italian film production, a passionate kiss between Jürgens and Dandridge&#x27;s characters was permitted in the shooting of &quot;Tamango&quot;. This was Dandridge&#x27;s first, and only, on-screen kiss with a white actor. &quot;Tamango&quot; was withheld from American release until late 1959. It received mixed reviews from critics and achieved only minor success.

In MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Decks Ran Red&quot; (1958), Dandridge co-starred with James Mason, Broderick Crawford, and Stuart Whitman as Mahia, a cook&#x27;s wife aboard a tired World War II surplus freighter enduring a mutiny. Despite being universally panned, the film generated a respectable audience. During production, fellow actor Stuart Whitman said that he noted her strength as she was going through personal turmoil.

In late 1958, Dandridge accepted producer Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s offer to star alongside Sidney Poitier in Goldwyn&#x27;s forthcoming production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. This was her first major Hollywood film in five years. Her acceptance angered the black community, who felt the story&#x27;s negative stereotyping of blacks was degrading. When the initial director, Rouben Mamoulian, was replaced with Otto Preminger, he informed Dandridge that her performance was not credible and that she needed intensive coaching to handle such a role. &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; had a long and costly production. All the sets and costumes were destroyed in a fire and had to be replaced, which amounted to a loss of almost $2 million. Continuous script rewrites and other problems prolonged the production and ultimately pushed the film over its original budget. When it was released in June 1959, it drew mixed reviews and failed financially.

In 1959, Dandridge starred in the low-budget British thriller &quot;Malaga&quot;, in which she played a European woman with an Italian name. The film, co-starring Trevor Howard and Edmund Purdom, plotted a jewel robbery and its aftermath. Some pre-release publicity invited the belief that Dandridge received her first, and only, on-screen kiss with a white actor (Howard) in this film. She had kissed her white costar in &quot;Tamango&quot;, but Dandridge and Howard, under László Benedek&#x27;s direction, created some strongly understated sexual tension. The film was withheld from a theatrical release abroad until 1960, and was not released until 1962 in the United States. &quot;Malaga&quot; was her final completed film appearance.

In 1962, Dandridge was filmed with Alain Delon on the set of &quot;La Fabuleuse Aventure de Marco Polo&quot;, a Raoul Lévy-produced French-Italian film that was abandoned due to financial issues. Years later it was released as Marco the Magnificent without either Dandridge or Delon.. She also appeared as Anita in a Highland Park Music Theater production of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, but she lasted only two performances due to illness. On 31 March 1962, Dandridge sang in the Le Paon Rouge nightclub of the Phoenicia Intercontinental as the guest of honor.

By 1963, Dandridge&#x27;s popularity had dwindled, and she was performing in nightclubs to pay off debts from numerous lawsuits. She filed for bankruptcy and went into seclusion before appearing as a lounge act in Las Vegas in 1964. In 1965, she attempted to revive her acting career. Dandridge signed a new contract in Mexico and was scheduled to appear as the female lead in a film about outlaw Johnny Ringo.

== Personal life ==
Dandridge was a Democrat, and she supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

Having developed an interest in activism because of the racism she encountered in the industry, Dandridge became involved with the National Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

=== Marriages and relationships ===
During an engagement at the Cotton Club, Dandridge met Harold Nicholas, a dancer and entertainer. They married at a Hollywood ceremony on September 6, 1942. Guests at their wedding included Oscar-winner Hattie McDaniel, Etta Jones, and choreographer Nick Castle. They had an unhappy marriage, which deteriorated because of Nicholas&#x27; womanizing and inattentiveness. By 1948, Nicholas had abandoned his family. Dandridge filed for divorce in September 1950, and it was finalized in October 1951.

Dandridge gave birth to her only child, Harolyn Suzanne Nicholas, on September 2, 1943. While she was in labor, Nicholas left her stranded at her sister-in-law&#x27;s home without the car when he went to play golf. At first, Dandridge refused to go to the hospital without him. Harolyn&#x27;s delayed birth required the use of forceps. This may have resulted in the brain damage that left her requiring lifelong constant care. Dandridge blamed herself for her daughter&#x27;s condition, and for not getting to the hospital sooner. Harolyn was unable to speak and never recognized Dandridge as her mother. Dandridge was private about her daughter&#x27;s condition; she didn&#x27;t publicly speak about it until a 1963 appearance on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;.

While filming &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; (1954), she began an affair with director Otto Preminger that lasted four years, during which Preminger advised her on career matters. He demanded that she accept only starring roles after her success in his film. Dandridge later regretted following his advice. She became pregnant by him in 1955, but was forced to have an abortion by the studio. She ended the affair when she realized that Preminger had no plans to leave his wife to marry her. Their affair was depicted in the biopic &quot;Introducing Dorothy Dandridge&quot;, in which Preminger was portrayed by actor Klaus Maria Brandauer.

Dandridge married Jack Denison on June 22, 1959. They divorced in 1962, amid financial setbacks and allegations of domestic violence. Dandridge discovered that the people who were handling her finances had swindled her out of $150,000, and she owed $139,000 in back taxes. She was forced to sell her Hollywood home and place her daughter in a California state mental institution, Camarillo State Hospital. Dandridge moved into a small apartment on Fountain Avenue in West Hollywood, California.

== Final days and death ==
On the evening of September 7, 1965, Dandridge spoke by telephone from Los Angeles with her friend and former sister-in-law Geraldine &quot;Geri&quot; Branton. Dandridge was scheduled to fly to New York City the next day to prepare for her nightclub engagement at Basin Street East. Branton told biographers that during the long conversation, Dandridge veered from expressing hope for the future, to singing Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;People&quot; in its entirety, to making a cryptic remark moments before hanging up on her: &quot;Whatever happens, I know you will understand.&quot;

On the morning of September 8 around 7:15 am, Dandridge telephoned her manager, Earl Mills, asking him to reschedule a hospital appointment she had that morning where a cast would be applied to her foot where a tiny bone fracture had occurred in a fall five days earlier. A few minutes later, she called again and requested a further delay and a 10:00 am appointment was scheduled. Her manager Mills received no response when he arrived at her door at the appointed time.

Several hours later, Dandridge was found unresponsive in her apartment by Mills after he had finally broken in the apartment door using the tire iron from his car. A Los Angeles pathology institute determined that the cause of death was an accidental overdose of the antidepressant imipramine. The Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office concluded that she died of a fat embolism resulting from a recently sustained right foot fracture.

On September 12, 1965, a private funeral service was held at the Little Chapel of the Flowers; Dandridge was cremated and her ashes interred in the Freedom Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

== Legacy ==
In 1997 a tribute to Dandridge was aired on the talk show &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, featuring biographer Donald Bogle and actors Ruby Dee and Cicely Tyson, who acknowledge Dandridge&#x27;s contribution to the image of African Americans in American motion pictures.

In the movie &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot; (1995), Wesley Snipes played Noxeema Jackson, a drag queen whose dream is to play Dorothy Dandridge in a movie about her life and work.

In 1999, Halle Berry produced and starred in the movie &quot;Introducing Dorothy Dandridge&quot;, for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award. When Berry won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot;, she dedicated the &quot;moment [to] Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll.&quot; Both Dandridge and Berry were from Cleveland, Ohio, and they were born in the same hospital.

Dandridge was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in January 1984. She is featured as the most prominent figure in a mural on an exterior wall of Hollywood High School. A statue of Dandridge, designed by Catherine Hardwicke, honors multi-ethnic leading ladies of the cinema, including Mae West, Dolores del Río, and Anna May Wong.

Recording artist Janelle Monáe performs a song titled &quot;Dorothy Dandridge Eyes&quot; on her 2013 album &quot;The Electric Lady&quot;, with Esperanza Spalding. In the 1969 movie &quot;The Lost Man&quot;, Dorothy Starr (played by Beverly Todd) says that she named herself after Dandridge.

In a February 2016 episode of &quot;Black-ish&quot;, &quot;Sink or Swim,&quot; Beyoncé is referred to as the Dorothy Dandridge of her time, citing the star power that Dandridge wielded in her day.

In 2020, Laura Harrier portrayed Camille Washington in the miniseries &quot;Hollywood&quot;. She is an up-and-coming actress during the Hollywood Golden Age in the post-World War II era, a character largely inspired by and based on Dandridge.

== Discography ==
Dandridge first gained fame as a solo artist from her performances in nightclubs, usually accompanied by Phil Moore on piano. Although she was known for her renditions of songs such as &quot;Blow Out the Candle&quot;, &quot;You Do Something to Me&quot;, and &quot;Talk Sweet Talk to Me&quot;, she recorded very little on vinyl. It is unknown whether her lack of recording was due to personal choice or lack of opportunity.

=== As part of the Dandridge Sisters singing group ===
=== As a solo artist ===

In 1958, she recorded a full-length album for Verve Records featuring Oscar Peterson with Herb Ellis, Ray Brown, and Alvin Stoller (Catalogue #314 547-514 2) that remained unreleased in the vaults until a CD release in 1999. This CD also included four tracks from 1961 (with an unknown orchestra) that included one 45 rpm record single and another aborted single:
The tracks &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Evening&quot; and &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; were aborted for release as a single and remained in the Verve vaults until the &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; release in 1999. These are the only known songs Dandridge recorded on vinyl. Several songs she sang, including her version of &quot;Cow-Cow Boogie&quot; were recorded on soundies and are not included on this list.

<text>A soundie is a three-minute American musical film displaying a performance. Soundies were produced between 1940 and 1946 and have been referred to as &quot;precursors to music videos&quot;. Soundies exhibited a variety of musical genres in an effort to draw a broad audience. The shorts were originally viewed in public places on &quot;Panorams&quot;: coin-operated, 16mm rear projection machines. Panorams were typically located in businesses like nightclubs, bars, and restaurants. Due to World War II, Soundies also featured patriotic messages and advertisements for war bonds. Hollywood films were censored but Soundies weren&#x27;t, so the films occasionally had daring content like burlesque acts; these were produced to appeal to soldiers on leave.

== Technology ==
Filmed professionally on black-and-white 35 mm stock, like theatrical motion pictures, they were printed on the more portable and economical 16 mm film.

The Panoram &quot;movie jukebox&quot; was manufactured by the Mills Novelty Company of Chicago. Each Panoram housed a 16 mm RCA film projector, with eight Soundies films threaded in an endless-loop arrangement. A system of mirrors flashed the image from the lower half of the cabinet onto a front-facing screen in the top half. Because of the mirror arrangement, the films had to be printed with the image &quot;flipped&quot; (with the titles appearing backwards on the screen). Each film cost 10 cents to play, with no choice of song; the patron saw whatever film was next in the queue. Panorams could be found in public amusement centers, nightclubs, taverns, restaurants, and factory lounges, and the films were changed weekly. The completed Soundies were generally made available within a few weeks of their filming, by the Soundies Distributing Corporation of America.

Several production companies filmed the Soundies shorts in New York City, Hollywood, and Chicago: James Roosevelt&#x27;s Globe Productions (1940–41), Cinemasters (1940–41), Minoco Productions (owned by Mills Novelty, 1941–43), RCM Productions (1941–46), LOL Productions (1943), Glamourettes (1943), Filmcraft Productions (1943–46), and Alexander Productions (1946) led by William D. Alexander). The performers recorded the music in advance, and mimed to the soundtrack during filming.

==Competition==
The movie-jukebox idea developed several imitations and variations of the technical design; the most successful of these imitators were the Techniprocess company (managed by Rudy Vallee) and the Featurettes company, which used original novelty songs and usually unknown talent (17-year-old Gwen Verdon appears in a couple of the Featurettes as &quot;Gwen Verdun&quot;). As Soundies quickly gained most of the market for jukebox films, the other companies disbanded, and some sold their films to the Soundies concern.

==Musical genres==
Soundies emphasized variety from their beginning; the first three bandleaders who contracted for Soundies were boogie-woogie specialist Will Bradley, established popular music maestro Vincent Lopez, and Hawaiian singer-leader Ray Kinney. Soundies displayed all genres of music, from classical to big-band swing, and from hillbilly novelties to patriotic songs. Harry McClintock, Jimmy Dorsey, Louis Jordan, Spike Jones, Stan Kenton, Kay Starr, Johnnie Johnston, Les Brown, The Hoosier Hot Shots, Charlie Spivak, Cliff Edwards, Martha Tilton, Sally Rand, Nick Lucas, Gene Krupa, Anita O&#x27;Day, Jimmie Dodd, Merle Travis, and Lawrence Welk were some of the leading Soundies performers. Many stars of the future made appearances in Soundies at the beginning of their careers, including Gale Storm, Dorothy Dandridge, Ricardo Montalbán, Liberace, Doris Day, Gloria Grahame, Cyd Charisse, Alan Ladd, Marilyn Maxwell, and Yvonne DeCarlo.

Many nightclub and recording artists also made Soundies, including Harry &quot;The Hipster&quot; Gibson, Benny Fields, Frances Faye, Gloria Parker, Charles Magnante, Milton DeLugg, and Gus Van. In the mid-1940s, during a moratorium imposed by James Petrillo of the musicians&#x27; union, Soundies resorted to filming nonmusical vaudeville acts, featuring exotic dancers Sally Rand and Faith Bacon, animal acts, acrobats, impressionists, and jugglers.

Beginning in 1941, Soundies experimented with expanding its format, and filmed comedy Soundies with &quot;Our Gang&quot; actor Carl &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Switzer, Broadway comic Willie Howard, dialect comedians Smith and Dale, Harry Langdon, Snub Pollard, and The Keystone Cops. Most of these films were nonmusical, and were not as well received as the musical Soundies. Soundies abandoned the comedy-sketch idea, but continued to produce filmed versions of comic novelty songs.

Some bandleaders recognized the promotional value of Soundies. Will Bradley, Vincent Lopez, and Ray Kinney were the first, as has been mentioned, and Ozzie Nelson, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Lawrence Welk, and Louis Jordan followed. The most prolific Soundies bandleaders were Johnny Long (18 titles) and Stan Kenton (17 titles); cowboy entertainer Red River Dave was almost as prolific (14 titles).

More than 1,800 Soundies minimusicals were made, many of which have been released on home video. The Soundies films were regularly described and reviewed in the entertainment and music trade publications, such as &quot;Billboard&quot;.

==Wartime impact==
During their first year, the Soundies made millions of dollars (in dimes). However, in late 1941, the federal government restricted the use of rubber and precious metals, prioritizing these resources for military use during wartime. This meant that Mills Novelty could no longer build and sell Panoram machines, and had to confine its activities to keeping the existing projectors supplied with films. Soundies became strictly a production company, dedicated to making its own musical shorts.

==Eclipse==
The Soundies Distributing Corporation of America remained active until 1947. With commercial television developing rapidly, the Soundies machines and films became obsolete. Almost all of the Panoram jukeboxes were either junked or modified into self-service &quot;peepshow&quot; machines. Most remaining Panorams are in the hands of collectors and are occasionally offered for sale. 

The library of approximately 1,800 Soundies films was made available first to home-movie companies Castle Films and Official Films, then to television via Official&#x27;s TV division, and ultimately to home video (via England&#x27;s Charly Records, which acquired the Official prints and negatives). The trade publication &quot;Billboard&quot; reported in February 1951 that Official Films had spent $300,000 preparing the Soundies film library for television syndication, under the series title &quot;Music Hall Varieties&quot;; Official earned more than $700,000 from local TV stations. 

==Documentaries==
Three documentaries have been produced about Soundies. Don McGlynn produced and edited &quot;The Soundies&quot; in 1986, hosted by Cab Calloway; the film was broadcast nationally on PBS. Dewey Russell compiled an hourlong, direct-to-video history, &quot;Soundies: Music Video from the &#x27;40s&quot; in 1987, narrated by Michael Sollazzo. Chris Lamson produced &quot;Soundies: A Musical History,&quot; hosted by Michael Feinstein, in 2007 for PBS.

==Legacy==
For today&#x27;s filmmakers and archivists, Soundies are known for preserving rare performances of African-American artists who had fewer opportunities to perform in mainstream films. Such artists as The Ink Spots, Fats Waller, Duke Ellington, Louis Jordan, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Dorothy Dandridge, Big Joe Turner, Bob Howard, Billy Eckstine, Count Basie, The Mills Brothers, Herb Jeffries, Cab Calloway, Meade Lux Lewis, Lena Horne, Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, and Stepin Fetchit all made Soundies (several of these were excerpted from longer theatrical films).

==Later forms==

The Soundies concept was revived in 1951 by producer Louis D. Snader. Radio stations relied on transcriptions—recorded musical performances. Snader brought the idea to television with films, which he called &quot;Snader Telescriptions.&quot; Snader hired dozens of pop-music acts and vaudeville performers, many of whom had already appeared in Soundies, to star in his new films. Snader Telescriptions are often confused with Soundies because of their similarity in length and personnel.

In 1958, the original Soundies &quot;jukebox&quot; concept was revived by French company Cameca as Scopitone. Similar to Soundies, Scopitones are short musical films designed to be played on a specially designed coin-operated jukebox, but with new technical improvements - color and high-fidelity sound. Scopitones were printed on color 16mm film with magnetic sound, instead of Soundies&#x27; black-and-white film with optical sound. By the mid-1960s, Scopitone jukeboxes had spread across England and the United States.

<text>Magnificent Obsession is a 1929 novel by American author Lloyd C. Douglas. It was one of four of his books that were eventually made into blockbuster motion pictures, the other three being &quot;The Robe&quot;, &quot;White Banners&quot; and &quot;The Big Fisherman&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Robert Merrick is resuscitated by a rescue crew after a boating accident. The crew is thus unable to save the life of Dr. Hudson, a physician renowned for his ability to help people, who was having a heart attack at the same time on the other side of the lake. Merrick then decides to devote his life to making up for the doctor&#x27;s, and becomes a physician himself.

Mrs. Hudson, the widow, moves to Europe after her daughter Joyce is married. Merrick progresses in his career, and in the story&#x27;s climax, gets involved in a railway accident in which Mrs. Hudson suffers serious injury. Merrick is instrumental in her recovery, and Merrick and Mrs. Hudson subsequently marry.

==Inspiration ==

The story behind the novel, and the identity of the surgeon on whose life it is based, is mentioned in articles in the American Association of Neurosurgeons&#x27; journal &quot;AANS Neurosurgeon&quot;, Magnificent Obsession and &quot;Inspirations and Epiphanies&quot;

The theme of the book is based on a passage from the Gospel of Matthew (chapter 6:1-4):
&quot;Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven...That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.&quot;
The philosophy behind the book is also partly that of &quot;pay it forward&quot;, the idea that good deeds received are not to be paid back to the doer of the deed, but to a needing person in the future.

==&quot;Dr. Hudson&#x27;s Secret Journal&quot; ==

Douglas later wrote a book in response to the flood of letters he received from readers who wanted to know where they could find the book to which he referred in the novel, &quot;Dr. Hudson&#x27;s Secret Journal&quot;. The Robert Merrick character decoded the journal, from which he learned the secret of his extraordinary success as a doctor. (According to the book, the secret was the literal practice of doing good deeds secretly, and thereby reaping spiritual power to use in becoming an excellent doctor.)

<text>The [[Joint-stock company|JSC]] A.S. Yakovlev Design Bureau () is a Russian aircraft designer and manufacturer (design office prefix Yak). Its head office is in Aeroport District, Northern Administrative Okrug, Moscow. It is a subsidiary of Yakovlev Corporation.

==Overview==
The bureau formed in 1934 under aircraft designer Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev as OKB-115 (the design bureau has its own production base at the facility No.115), but dates its birth from 12 May 1927, the day of maiden flight of the AIR-1 aircraft developed within the Department of Light Aircraft of GUAP (Head Agency of Aviation Industry) under the supervision of A.S. Yakovlev.

During World War II Yakovlev designed and produced a famed line of fighter aircraft.

Irkut acquired Yakovlev in April 2004. The Russian government merged the holding company with Mikoyan, Ilyushin, Irkut, Sukhoi and Tupolev as a new company named United Aircraft Building Corporation in February 2006.

The firm designed the &quot;Pchela&quot; (, &quot;bee&quot;) drone reconnaissance aircraft (first flown in 1990), but is perhaps best known for its highly successful line of World War II-era piston-engined fighter-aircraft.

In August 2023, Irkut Corporation rebranded itself as Yakovlev. The Sukhoi Superjet 100 was redesignated as the SJ-100, and the Irkut MC-21 also adopted the Yakovlev name.

; Sanctions
The company was sanctioned by the Canadian government on 22 August 2023.

<text>Apple Records is a British record label founded by the Beatles in 1968 as a division of Apple Corps Ltd. It was initially intended as a creative outlet for the Beatles, both as a group and individually, plus a selection of other artists including Mary Hopkin, James Taylor, Badfinger, and Billy Preston. In practice, the roster had become dominated by the mid-1970s with releases of the former Beatles as solo artists. Allen Klein managed the label from 1969 to 1973, then it was managed by Neil Aspinall on behalf of the Beatles and their heirs. Aspinall retired in 2007 and was replaced by Jeff Jones. Jones stepped down on 21 October 2024.

==History==
===1967–1969: early years===
Apple Corps Ltd was conceived by the Beatles in 1967 after the death of their manager Brian Epstein. It was intended to be a small group of companies (Apple Retail, Apple Publishing, Apple Electronics, and so on) as part of Epstein&#x27;s plan to create a tax-effective business structure. The first project that the band released after forming the company was their film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, which was produced under the Apple Films division. Apple Records was officially founded by the group after their return from India in 1968 as another sub-division of Apple Corps.

At this time, the Beatles were contracted to EMI. In a new distribution deal, EMI and its US subsidiary Capitol Records agreed to distribute Apple Records until 1976, while EMI retained ownership of their recordings. Beatles recordings issued in the United Kingdom on the Apple label carried Parlophone catalogue numbers, while US issues carried Capitol catalogue numbers. Apple Records owns the rights to all of the Beatles&#x27; videos and movie clips, and the rights to recordings of other artists signed to the label. The first catalogue number Apple 1 was a single pressing of Frank Sinatra singing &quot;Maureen Is a Champ&quot; (with lyrics by Sammy Cahn) to the melody of &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot; as a surprise gift for the 21st birthday of Ringo Starr&#x27;s wife Maureen.

Apple Records and Apple Publishing signed a number of acts whom the Beatles personally discovered or supported, and one or more of the Beatles would be involved in the recording sessions in most cases. Several notable artists were signed in the first year, including James Taylor, Mary Hopkin, Billy Preston, the Modern Jazz Quartet, the Iveys (who became Badfinger), Doris Troy, and former Liverpool singer Jackie Lomax who recorded George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot;.

===1969–1973: Klein era===
In 1969, the Beatles were in need of financial and managerial direction, and John Lennon was approached by Allen Klein, manager of The Rolling Stones. When Klein went on to manage Apple, three of the Beatles supported him with Paul McCartney being the only group member opposed to his involvement. McCartney had suggested his father-in-law Lee Eastman for the job.

Klein took control of Apple and shut down several sub-divisions, including Apple Electronics, and he dropped some of Apple Records&#x27; artistic roster. New signings to the label were not so numerous afterward and tended to arrive through the individual actions of the former Beatles. For example, Elephant&#x27;s Memory were recruited through Lennon and Ravi Shankar through Harrison. McCartney had little input into Apple Records&#x27; roster after 1970. Klein managed Apple Corps until March 1973, when his contract expired. The Beatles&#x27; entire pre-Apple catalogue on the Capitol label was re-issued on the Apple label in May 1971, including the singles from &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; to &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, and the albums from &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; to &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. The album covers remained unchanged with the Capitol logos.

===1973–2007: Aspinall era, Beatles reissues===
After Klein&#x27;s departure, Apple was managed by Neil Aspinall on behalf of the four Beatles and their heirs. Apple Records&#x27; distribution contract with EMI expired in 1976, when control of the Beatles&#x27; catalogue—including solo recordings to date by George Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr—reverted to EMI (Paul McCartney had acquired ownership of his solo recordings when he re-signed with Capitol in 1975).

The original UK versions of the Beatles&#x27; albums were released worldwide by EMI on compact disc in 1987 and 1988 on the Parlophone label. Previously, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; had been issued in Japan on CD in 1983 on the Toshiba-EMI label. Although this was a legitimate release, it was not authorised by the Beatles, EMI or Apple Corps. Following the settlement of Apple&#x27;s ten-year lawsuit against EMI in 1989, new projects began to move forward, including the &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; album and &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; series. It was after the &quot;Anthology&quot; project (spearheaded by Neil Aspinall) that the company resumed making significantly large profits again and began its revival.

The label was again newsworthy in 2006, as the long-running dispute between Apple Records&#x27; parent company and Apple Inc. went to the High Court (see &quot;Apple Corps v Apple Computer&quot;).

===2007–present: Jones era, iTunes reissues===
In 2007, longtime chief executive Neil Aspinall retired and was replaced by American music industry executive Jeff Jones. The Beatles&#x27; catalog was remastered and re-issued in September 2009 and was made available on iTunes in November 2010. In June 2009, Apple Records published their last album, &quot;Let it Roll: Songs by George Harrison&quot;. When Universal Music Group acquired EMI and the Beatles&#x27; recorded music catalogue, Calderstone Productions was formed in 2012 to administer the Beatles&#x27; catalogue.

In October 2024 it was announced that Jeff Jones would be stepping down as CEO of Apple.

==Design==
=== Origin ===
During the sixties, Paul McCartney discovered the work of Belgian surrealist René Magritte. As an admirer, McCartney started to collect paintings of the artist.

In 1967, a friend bought “Le Jeu De Mourre” for Paul McCartney. The work represents a green apple with the text &quot;Au Revoir&quot; placed on top. When McCartney saw it for the first time, he was impressed by the iconic look of the image. The big green apple later became the inspiration for the Apple Records company logo. To this day, McCartney still owns the 1966 painting.

=== Apple label ===

Standard Apple album and single labels displayed a bright green Granny Smith apple on the A-side, while the flipside displayed the cross section of the apple. The bright green apple returned for Beatles CDs releases in the 1990s, following initial CD releases by Parlophone.

On the US issue of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; album, the Granny Smith apple was red. The album was manufactured and distributed by United Artists Records and not Capitol Records; for contractual reasons, the red apple was used to mark the difference. The red apple also appeared on the back cover, and on the 2009 remastered edition back cover. Capitol&#x27;s parent company EMI purchased United Artists Records in the late 1970s, and Capitol gained the American rights to the &quot;Let It Be&quot; soundtrack album (along with the American rights to another, earlier, United Artists Beatles movie soundtrack LP, 1964&#x27;s &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;).

Aside from the red apple, other examples in which the apple has been altered include George Harrison&#x27;s album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; triple album, on which the first two discs have orange apples while the third has a jar label reading &quot;Apple Jam&quot;; black and white apples on John Lennon&#x27;s album &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; and Yoko Ono&#x27;s album &quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot;; a blue apple on Ringo Starr&#x27;s single &quot;Back Off Boogaloo&quot;; Harrison&#x27;s album &quot;Extra Texture (Read All About It)&quot;, on which the apple (in shrunken cartoon form) is eaten away at its core (this was intended to be a joke because it was released at a time when Apple Records was beginning to fold); and a red apple on Starr&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Blast from Your Past&quot;. Other types of apples were also used: in 1971, for Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; and Ono&#x27;s &quot;Fly&quot;, the apples respectively featured pictures of Lennon and Ono, as did the apples for Ono&#x27;s 1973 &quot;Approximately Infinite Universe&quot; and the singles that were released from these three albums.

==Zapple Records==
Zapple Records, an Apple Records subsidiary run by Barry Miles, a friend of McCartney, was intended as an outlet for the release of spoken word and avant-garde records, as a budget label in the style of a magazine or journal. It was active only from 3 February 1969 until June 1969; a string of projects were announced, and a number of recording sessions undertaken, but only two albums were released on the label both by solo Beatles, while another two LPs of finished material were issued by other labels after Zapple was closed down. The label was launched with the two Beatle related records firstly Lennon and Ono&#x27;s avant garde &quot;Unfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions&quot; (Zapple 1) and George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Electronic Sound&quot; (Zapple 2). An album of readings by Richard Brautigan was recorded and mixed for release as Zapple 3, and acetate disc copies and test pressings were cut but, said Miles, &quot;The Zapple label was folded by [Allen] Klein before the record could be released. The first two Zapple records did come out. We just didn&#x27;t have [Brautigan&#x27;s record] ready in time before Klein closed it down. None of the Beatles ever heard it.&quot; Brautigan&#x27;s record was eventually released as &quot;Listening to Richard Brautigan&quot; on Harvest Records, a subsidiary of Apple distributor EMI, in the US only.

The first recordings were made for Zapple in January 1969, as field recordings of poets in their homes by Miles on a portable tape recorder as he toured the east coast of America. This included poet and Fugs drummer Ken Weaver and Black Mountain poet Charles Olson. According to Miles, a spoken word album by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, which had been recorded and edited, would have been Zapple 4, and a spoken word album by Michael McClure had also been recorded. A planned Zapple release of a UK appearance by comedian Lenny Bruce was never completed. An early 1969 press release also named Pablo Casals as an expected guest on the label. American author Ken Kesey was given a tape recorder to record his impressions of London, but they were never released. Miles also had the intention of bringing world leaders to the label. Zapple was shut down in June 1969 by Klein, apparently with the backing of Lennon.

==Artists==
* Badfinger (originally known as the Iveys) – Signed to Apple after several demo tapes were brought in by Beatles&#x27; road manager Mal Evans, after getting approval from Paul McCartney, George Harrison and John Lennon. They had several top 10 hits in the UK and US, including the McCartney song &quot;Come and Get It&quot;, and recorded five albums for Apple.
* Black Dyke Mills Band (as John Foster &amp; Sons Ltd. Black Dyke Mills Band) – A north of England brass band whom Paul McCartney employed for the one-off &quot;Thingummybob&quot;/&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; single. It was recorded by McCartney on location near Bradford, where the group were based.
* Brute Force (stage name of Stephen Friedland) – Harrison attempted to have his song &quot;King of Fuh&quot; released as an Apple single. EMI refused to handle it, owing to its intentionally vulgar double entendre (&quot;Fuh king&quot;), but Apple manufactured a small number of copies in-house which were made available to the public. The song itself appears on the 2010 compilation &quot;Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records&quot;.
* Elastic Oz Band – A one-off single, &quot;God Save Us&quot;, was written and produced by Lennon and Yoko Ono to raise money for a legal battle involving &quot;Oz&quot; magazine. The A-side of the single was sung by Bill Elliot, later a member of Harrison&#x27;s Dark Horse Records signing Splinter.
* Elephant&#x27;s Memory – Recruited as backing band for Lennon and Ono, and also released material separately, including contributions to the soundtrack of the 1969 film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (not on Apple).
* Chris Hodge – Discovered by Ringo Starr; they shared an interest in UFOs. Hodge only released two singles on Apple, the second of them not issued in the UK.
* Mary Hopkin – Discovered after appearing on a UK television talent show and suggested by the model Twiggy. Her early recordings were produced by McCartney, including the Lennon-McCartney original &quot;Goodbye&quot; and her hit recording of &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;. She also released a Eurovision Song Contest entry on Apple (&quot;Knock, Knock Who&#x27;s There?&quot;) and two studio albums.
* Hot Chocolate (as Hot Chocolate Band) – Released one single, a reggae version of &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot;, which they recorded and had played to Lennon, who liked it. Their post-Apple releases as Hot Chocolate were more commercially successful.
* Jackie Lomax – Liverpudlian singer known to the Beatles through his Brian Epstein connections; he recorded the Harrison-produced album &quot;Is This What You Want?&quot;, released in 1969, which also includes musical contributions from Starr and McCartney. Lomax&#x27;s first single, &quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot;, features those three Beatles and was written by Harrison.
* Modern Jazz Quartet – Associated with Ono, and were famous prior to their involvement with Apple. They released two albums for the label, &quot;Under the Jasmin Tree&quot; and &quot;Space&quot;.
* Yoko Ono – Recorded extensively with Lennon and released several singles and albums herself; on these Lennon usually directed the band and also performed.
* David Peel and the Lower East Side – A political folk singer brought to the label by Lennon.
* Billy Preston – Brought in to work with the Beatles in January 1969 on their &quot;Get Back&quot;/&quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions, and signed as a solo artist. Harrison produced Preston&#x27;s recordings, including the 1969 hit single &quot;That&#x27;s The Way God Planned It&quot;. Preston&#x27;s recording of Harrison&#x27;s &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was released on Apple before Harrison&#x27;s version. Preston issued two albums on Apple, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way God Planned It&quot; in 1969 with George Harrison, Eric Clapton and Keith Richards, and its follow up &quot;Encouraging Words&quot; in 1970 with George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Delaney Bramlett. 
* Radha Krishna Temple (London), the UK branch of the Hare Krishna movement. Harrison brought the Temple devotees to the label in 1969 and produced two hit singles by them in 1969–70, including &quot;Hare Krishna Mantra&quot;, as well as their eponymous studio album, released in 1971.
* Ravi Shankar – An Indian classical musician. Harrison brought Shankar to the label in 1971 and produced his Apple releases, which included the &quot;Raga&quot; soundtrack and &quot;In Concert 1972&quot;, a double live album with Ali Akbar Khan.
* Ronnie Spector – Married to Phil Spector, who separately worked with the Beatles and solo Beatles from 1970 onwards. Harrison wrote, co-produced and played on her only Apple single, &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot;, which was made with her husband, as an attempt to revive her recording career.
* The Sundown Playboys – A French-language cajun band from Louisiana. A pre-existing single was brought to the label by Starr.
* John Tavener – A classical composer. His brother, a builder, worked on Starr&#x27;s house, and the drummer took an interest in Tavener.
* James Taylor – Recorded with McCartney, who appears on the Apple LP that launched his career.
* Trash (originally White Trash) – Brought to Apple by Tony Meehan, formerly of the Shadows. Their second single was a cover of &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; and charted on Apple in the UK.
* Doris Troy – An American soul artist since the early 1960s, who worked with Harrison and Preston while the latter was signed to Apple. Troy recorded one Apple album, and released two spin-off singles in 1970, the first of which, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Cute&quot;, was co-written with Harrison. Starr also collaborated on the album, and is credited as a co-writer with Harrison and Troy on some of the tracks.
* Lon and Derrek Van Eaton – Signed to the label in September 1971 by Harrison, who produced their debut single, &quot;Sweet Music&quot;. Starr also contributed to the recording, and to other tracks on the Van Eatons&#x27; 1972 Apple album &quot;Brother&quot;.

Also released were the soundtracks to &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;El Topo&quot; (in the US), the onetime Philles Records compilation &quot;Phil Spector&#x27;s Christmas Album&quot; and the multi-artist &quot;The Concert for Bangla Desh&quot;. Cassette and 8-track tape versions of &quot;Bangla Desh&quot; were marketed by Columbia Records after a deal that permitted the inclusion of Bob Dylan, a Columbia artist, on the album.

Artists who had considerable success in the pop and rock world after their initial sessions at Apple Records include Badfinger (originally known as the Iveys), James Taylor, Mary Hopkin, Hot Chocolate, Yoko Ono and Billy Preston.

Artists who auditioned to appear on the label, but did not make it, include:
* McGough and McGear (the latter of whom was McCartney&#x27;s brother), whose self-titled album was due to be released on Apple; it was instead released on Parlophone, to which both were signed as members of The Scaffold.
* Grapefruit, whose single &quot;Dear Delilah&quot; was issued on RCA Records with Apple publishing credit.
* Focal Point, a Liverpool band who were going to be managed by Brian Epstein before he died, were signed to Apple after chasing McCartney around Hyde Park. John Lennon signed them to Apple; they were the first band signed. Their single &quot;Sycamore Sid&quot; was issued on Deram Records with credit to Apple Publishing on the label.
* Fire (a band with future Strawbs member Dave Lambert on guitar) released two singles in 1968: &quot;Father&#x27;s Name Was Dad&quot;, produced by Tony Clarke, and &quot;Round the Gum Tree&quot;, on Decca with Apple publishing credits.
* Delaney and Bonnie&#x27;s &quot;Accept No Substitute&quot; album was originally meant to be released on Apple in 1969; it was first released commercially on Elektra Records the same year. In England, copies of the LP were pressed before Apple realized the band were already contracted to Elektra. No album covers were ever printed; the disc is now a high-value Apple collectible.
* Mortimer were a folk-based three-piece, notable for a recording of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Two of Us&quot;. It was planned for release as an Apple single in 1969 (before the Beatles&#x27; version was issued) under the title &quot;On Our Way Home&quot;, but the release was cancelled.
* Raven were offered a contract to record with Apple after Harrison received a tape from the band&#x27;s manager Marty Angelo. Harrison was unable to be their producer, but sent Apple A&amp;R chief Peter Asher to New York City to discuss Asher filling the role. This is documented in the book &quot;The Longest Cocktail Party&quot; and in Angelo&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Once Life Matters: A New Beginning&quot;. The band turned down Asher&#x27;s offer, and instead signed with Columbia Records in 1969.
* Slow Dog (later known as Wheels) were a Cambridge-based rock band fronted by Scottish singer/guitarist Dave Kelly. They were the winners of the Apple Records-sponsored national talent contest early 1969, organised by Asher prior to his departure for the US. The winner of the talent contest was promised a record contract with Apple Records, but owing to Asher&#x27;s departure, the band only recorded demo tracks. However, on recommendation from Mal Evans, Warner Bros. Records in London signed Slow Dog to a record contract, officially changing their name to Wheels.

<text>Hideki Yukawa (; ; 23 January 1907 – 8 September 1981) was a Japanese physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1949 for his successful prediction of the existence of the meson.

==Biography==


He was born as Hideki Ogawa in Tokyo and grew up in Kyoto with two older brothers, two older sisters, and two younger brothers. He read the Confucian &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, and later Lao-Tzu and Chuang-Tzu. His father, for a time, considered sending him to technical college rather than university since he was &quot;not as outstanding a student as his older brothers&quot;. However, when his father broached the idea with his middle school principal, the principal praised his &quot;high potential&quot; in mathematics and offered to adopt Ogawa himself in order to keep him on a scholarly career. At that, his father relented.

Ogawa decided against becoming a mathematician when in high school; his teacher marked his exam answer as incorrect when Ogawa proved a theorem but in a different manner than the teacher expected. He decided against a career in experimental physics in college when he demonstrated clumsiness in glassblowing, a requirement for experiments in spectroscopy.

In 1929, after receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Kyoto Imperial University, he stayed on as a lecturer for four years. After graduation, he was interested in theoretical physics, particularly in the theory of elementary particles. 

In 1932, he married . In accordance with Japanese customs (see mukoyoshi), since he came from a family with many sons but his father-in-law Genyo had none, he was adopted by Genyo and changed his family name from Ogawa to Yukawa. The couple had two sons, Harumi and Takaaki. In 1933 he became a lecturer at Osaka Imperial University, at 26 years old.

In 1935 he published his theory of mesons, which explained the interaction between protons and neutrons at Osaka Imperial University, and was a major influence on research into elementary particles. 

In 1938, he received his Ph.D. degree at Osaka Imperial University for his predictions regarding the existence of mesons and his theoretical work on the nature of nuclear forces. These research achievements were the reason he was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.

In 1940 he became a professor in Kyoto Imperial University. In 1940 he won the Imperial Prize of the Japan Academy, in 1943 the Decoration of Cultural Merit from the Japanese government. In 1949 he became a professor at Columbia University, the same year he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, after the discovery by Cecil Frank Powell, Giuseppe Occhialini and César Lattes of Yukawa&#x27;s predicted pi meson in 1947. Yukawa also worked on the theory of K-capture, in which a low energy electron is absorbed by the nucleus, after its initial prediction by G. C. Wick.

Yukawa became the first chairman of Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1953. He received a Doctorate, &quot;honoris causa,&quot; from the University of Paris and honorary memberships in the Royal Society, Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Indian Academy of Sciences, the International Academy of Philosophy and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Pontificia Academia Scientiarum.

He was an editor of &quot;Progress of Theoretical Physics&quot;, and published the books &quot;Introduction to Quantum Mechanics&quot; (1946) and &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Elementary Particles&quot; (1948).

== Activism ==
In 1955, he joined ten other leading scientists and intellectuals in signing the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, calling for nuclear disarmament.

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution; subsequently, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Retirement and death ==
Yukawa retired from Kyoto University in 1970 as a Professor Emeritus. Owing to increasing infirmity, in his final years he appeared in public in a wheelchair. He died at his home in Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, on 8 September 1981 from pneumonia and heart failure, aged 74. His tomb is in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto.

Solo violinist Diana Yukawa (ダイアナ湯川) is a close relative of Hideki Yukawa.

<text>Rising Up is an EP by British heavy metal band Diamond Head released in 1992. The recording stems following Brian Tatler and Sean Harris partnering back again, now with Karl Wilcox on drums and Eddie Chaos on Bass, following a jam session with Metallica. Playing only new material, the band completed a small tour of UK clubs under the pseudonym &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;. Following that the band entered the studio to record tracks for the 2-track 12&quot; EP, which was available only at gigs and specialist record shops. The track &#x27;Wild On The Streets&#x27; had its origins back in 1978, but it had never been completed or recorded.

<text>Lightning to the Nations (also known as The White Album) is the debut album by British heavy metal band Diamond Head. The album was recorded in 1980 (after the 1977 and 1979 demos) and released later that year through Happy Face Records, a label owned by the producer Muff Murfin of The Old Smithy studio of Worcester, due to lack of interest from major labels and the band feeling that they needed to get the ball rolling as other bands from the same era, such as Iron Maiden and Def Leppard, were already becoming big names. 

It was originally released in a plain white sleeve with no title or track listing, and was subsequently named after the first track on the album. Metal Blade Records re-released it on CD in 1992. In 2001, it was re-issued in its original &quot;White Album&quot; form by Sanctuary Records, featuring seven bonus tracks that were featured on singles and EPs from this era.

==Album information==
Diamond Head had gained enough attention to tour as support with AC/DC and Iron Maiden. Although a clutch of record companies fought to sign the band, none were willing to fully commit. The fact that the band was at the time managed by Sean Harris&#x27; mother (Linda Harris) did not help the band&#x27;s commercial momentum. So, while other new wave of British heavy metal bands were signed to major labels and were headlining their own tours, Diamond Head were growing increasingly impatient and decided that they would release their material through their own label, Happy Face Records.

The album was recorded within seven days at The Old Smythy Studio in Worcester, which the band described as &#x27;dead&#x27;. This original album came in a plain sleeve with no title, having on it only a signature of one of the band members and no track listings. The reason for this was that the band&#x27;s new manager, Reg Fellows, owned a cardboard factory and could produce blank sleeves at low cost. Also, the reason for recording this album was an attempt to lay down some tracks so they could send it to a record company who would be more willing to release it, as the recording costs had already been covered; this idea came from Fellows and Linda Harris (by then tour manager). There were originally only 1,000 copies pressed of the album, which were only available at the band&#x27;s concerts or through mail-order at a price of £3.50. The only mail-order advertisement appeared in British music magazine &#x27;Sounds&#x27; and ran for four weeks. However, the band did not pay for any advertisements and ended up being sued.

This album has become one of the most sought-after items from the time for record collectors. Later, there was a second pressing of 1000 copies that included track listings. The only original one-and-a-quarter-inch master tapes were lost for years after the band sent them to the German record company Woolfe Records, who did release the album (theirs having a front cover with a map of the world burning).

In 1993, Metal Blade Records released the first official CD version of the entire album. They did not attempt to find the master tapes or create a professional transfer from the original vinyl version and used a remix instead (made in 1986). Additionally, the track &quot;It&#x27;s Electric&quot; has a major mastering error: the intro of the song is missing and it skips in shortly before the vocals start. High Vaultage Records released another version of the album in 1997, this time sourced from the German Woolfe Records LP. As a bonus, most of the 7&quot; single tracks from that era were included. In 2001, a Sanctuary Records release came out. It includes the same mastering as the High Vaultage CD, which had since gone out of print. The 2011 Deluxe Edition, remastered by Andy Pearce, includes the original album sourced from the rediscovered master tape. This release, the 2016 HNE Recordings Ltd release, and the 2022 Silver Lining Music release are the only CD releases sourced from the original tapes; all other CD versions include either the 1986 remix or the High Vaultage vinyl dubs.

==Legacy and influence==
The album brought Diamond Head to the forefront of the new wave of British heavy metal scene and was a big influence on many later metal bands, including Metallica and Megadeth. The former have covered songs such as &quot;The Prince&quot;, &quot;Sucking My Love&quot;, &quot;Am I Evil?&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Electric&quot;, and &quot;Helpless&quot; throughout their career and recorded most of them. Versions from various periods were compiled on Metallica&#x27;s album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;. As a result, Diamond Head became relatively well-known to Metallica fans and enjoyed exposure to a broader public than similar NWOBHM bands from the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In 2008, the Japanese metal magazine &quot;Burrn!&quot; rated this album as the third-best &quot;riff album&quot; of all time, behind Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Master of Reality&quot; and Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;. The &quot;Guitarists&#x27; Book of Heavy Metal&quot; ranked the track &quot;Am I Evil?&quot; at on its list of the best metal riffs behind Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Lightning to the Nations&quot; 42nd on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="187679" wikidata="Q2260449" url="?curid=187679" title="Scofield Reference Bible">
<text>The Scofield Reference Bible is a widely circulated study Bible. Edited and annotated by the American Bible student Cyrus I. Scofield, it popularized dispensationalism at the beginning of the 20th century. Published by Oxford University Press and containing the entire text of the traditional, Protestant King James Version, it first appeared in 1909 and was revised by the author in 1917.

==Features and legacy==

The Scofield Bible had several innovative features. Most important, it printed what amounted to a commentary on the biblical text alongside the Bible instead of in a separate volume, the first to do so in English since the Geneva Bible (1560). It also contained a cross-referencing system that tied together related verses of Scripture and allowed a reader to follow biblical themes from one chapter and book to another (so called &quot;chain references&quot;). Finally, the 1917 edition also attempted to date events of the Bible. It was in the pages of the Scofield Reference Bible that many Christians first encountered Archbishop James Ussher&#x27;s calculation of the date of Creation as 4004 BC; and through discussion of Scofield&#x27;s notes, which advocated the &quot;gap theory,&quot; fundamentalists began a serious internal debate about the nature and chronology of creation.

The first edition of the Scofield Bible (1909) was published only a few years before World War I, a war that destroyed a cultural optimism that had viewed the world as entering a new era of peace and prosperity; then the post-World War II era witnessed the creation of a homeland for Jews in Palestine. Thus, Scofield&#x27;s premillennialism seemed prophetic. &quot;At the popular level, especially, many people came to regard the dispensationalist scheme as completely vindicated.&quot; Sales of the Reference Bible exceeded two million copies by the end of World War II.

The Scofield Reference Bible promoted dispensationalism, the belief that between creation and the final judgment there would be seven distinct eras of God&#x27;s dealing with man and that these eras are a framework for synthesizing the message of the Bible. Largely through the influence of Scofield&#x27;s notes, many fundamentalist Christians in the United States adopted a dispensational theology. Scofield&#x27;s notes on the Book of Revelation are a major source for the various timetables, judgments, and plagues elaborated on by popular religious writers such as Hal Lindsey, Edgar C. Whisenant, and Tim LaHaye; and in part because of the success of the Scofield Reference Bible, twentieth-century American fundamentalists placed greater stress on eschatological speculation.

The &quot;Scofield Bible&quot; has had a significant influence on the Christian Zionist movement. The work states that antisemitism is a sin. Citing Genesis 12:3 - &quot;I will bless them that bless thee&quot; - Scofield argued that &quot;The man or nation that lifts a voice or hand against Israel invites the wrath of God.&quot;

===Later editions===
 The 1917 Scofield Reference Bible notes are now in the public domain, and the 1917 edition is &quot;consistently the best selling edition of the Scofield Bible&quot; in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 1967, Oxford University Press published a revision of the Scofield Bible with a slightly modernized KJV text, and a muting of some of the tenets of Scofield&#x27;s theology. Recent editions of the KJV Scofield Study Bible have moved the textual changes made in 1967 to the margin. The Press continues to issue editions under the title &quot;Oxford Scofield Study Bible&quot;, and there are translations into French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. For instance, the French edition published by the Geneva Bible Society is printed with a revised version of the Louis Segond translation that includes additional notes by a Francophone committee.

In the 21st century, Oxford University Press published Scofield notes to accompany six additional English translations.

<text>Borrowed Time is the second studio album by British heavy metal band Diamond Head. It was recorded in 1981 and released in 1982, reaching Number 24 on the UK Albums Chart.

In a 2008 interview, guitarist Brian Tatler said that this was his favourite period with Diamond Head and that the band &quot;seemed to be getting somewhere after six years of building&quot;.

== Background ==
This was the band&#x27;s first major label released after being signed to MCA Records in 1981. As this was their first album under a major label, the album was much cleaner and better produced. However, some say that MCA was the wrong label for Diamond Head, which is one of the contributions to their downfall. Some have also questioned the necessity for &quot;Am I Evil?&quot; and &quot;Lightning to the Nations&quot; to be included on the album, since they had already appeared on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Lightning to the Nations&quot;. The reason for this was that their first album was only meant as a demo with the idea of &quot;Borrowed Time&quot; being their first official album. However, things have not quite worked out that way, with the former becoming their most notable work to date.

Originally, &quot;Borrowed Time&quot; was only released on CD in Japan, making it a highly collectible item. Although on 15 October 2008, it was released by Metal Mind Productions on CD format, with bonus tracks. However, this was limited to 2,000 copies. The release contains B-sides, such as &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;, which were previously unavailable on CD. However, Geffen Records have now issued the album on general release. The cover features a lavish Rodney Matthews illustrated gatefold sleeve, based on the album&#x27;s Elric of Melniboné theme, which was the most expensive sleeve commissioned by MCA at that time.

== Musical style ==
This album saw the band move away from all-out heavy riffs and towards softer and more progressive songs, such as &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Ever Leave Me&quot;, which was well-received by fans, as the former has remained a regular in the live set list to date.

== Reception ==
The album managed to get to No. 24 in the UK album charts, becoming the band&#x27;s first and only album to chart. The band went on to perform a full scale UK arena tour, performing large venues such as London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo.

The album failed to live up to prior expectations as the band&#x27;s more commercial take to their music turned out to be a disappointment to critics.

<doc id="187681" wikidata="Q1408757" url="?curid=187681" title="Canterbury (album)">
<text>Canterbury is the third studio album by British heavy metal band Diamond Head. It was recorded and released in 1983, reaching number 32 on the UK Albums Chart. The progressive rock sound, which was only hinted at on &quot;Borrowed Time&quot;, is much more prominent here.

==Background==
This album was originally entitled &quot;Making Music&quot; (after the first track on the album) but later became &quot;Canterbury&quot;. The success of this album was initially stalled by the fact that the first 20,000 copies suffered vinyl-pressing problems, causing the LP to jump. In addition, this album was an attempt by the band to show that they could write more than just heavy metal songs. However, many fans wanted a heavier follow up to the previous record, &quot;Borrowed Time&quot; and did not like the progressive direction.

There were two singles to be released from this album, which were &quot;Makin&#x27; Music&quot; (that had an extended version and an interview with Andy Peebles, now available on the released version of the album) and &quot;Out of Phase&quot;, which had &quot;The Kingmaker&quot; as its B-side. &quot;Out of Phase&quot; was also released as a B-side for a live version of &quot;Sucking My Love&quot;.

The song &quot;Knight of the Swords&quot; is about the god Arioch in Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Elric stories.

This album was only released on CD in Japan making it a highly collectible item. On 15 October 2007 it was released by Metal Mind Productions on CD format, with bonus tracks. However, this was limited to 2000 copies. The album was made widely available in 2009, along with &quot;Borrowed Time&quot;, as part of the boxset &quot;The MCA Years&quot;.

<text>Soyuz 5 (, &quot;Union 5&quot;) was a Soyuz mission using the Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union on 15 January 1969, which docked with Soyuz 4 in orbit. It was the first docking of two crewed spacecraft of any nation, and the first transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another of any nation, the only time a transfer was accomplished with a space walk – two months before the United States Apollo 9 mission performed the first internal crew transfer.

The mission, flown by cosmonauts Boris Volynov, Aleksei Yeliseyev, and Yevgeny Khrunov, was also memorable for its dramatic re-entry. The craft&#x27;s service module did not separate, so it entered the atmosphere nose-first, leaving Volynov hanging by his restraining straps. As the craft aerobraked, the atmosphere burned through the service module, allowing the remaining descent module to right itself before the escape hatch was burned through. During the descent, the parachute lines tangled and the landing rockets failed, resulting in a hard landing that broke Volynov&#x27;s teeth.

== Mission highlights ==
Launch preparations for Soyuz 5 went smoothly and the frigid mid-winter weather at the cosmodrome moderated a bit on January 15, with temperatures climbing to . During the countdown, a positive electrical discharge was detected around the base of the booster, so a halt was called to replace a voltage regulator. A technician had to strip down to his underwear in the chilly winter air to be able to fit inside the instrument compartment and remove four bolts holding the regulator in place. He swapped it with a replacement unit but was only able to get three of the bolts in place before his hands began to freeze, so the booster would have to launch with a missing bolt despite the possible safety risk posed. Liftoff took place at 10:04 AM local time and went flawlessly.

Soyuz 5 was piloted by commander Boris Volynov and carried flight engineers Aleksei Yeliseyev and Yevgeny Khrunov as the crew to be transferred to Soyuz 4 for reentry. The mission plan contained scientific, technical, and medical-biological research, testing of spacecraft systems and design elements, docking of piloted spacecraft, and transfer of cosmonauts from one craft to another in orbit.

Volynov remained behind on Soyuz 5, and returned to Earth in a remarkable re-entry. The service module of the Soyuz failed to separate after retrofire, but by that point it was too late to abort. While this had occurred on various Vostok and Voskhod flights, it was a much more serious problem for Volynov, as the Soyuz service module was much larger than the small retropack the earlier vehicles employed.

When the Soyuz started aerobraking in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, the combined spacecraft sought the most aerodynamically stable position - nose forward, with the heavy descent module facing directly into the air stream with only its light metal entry hatch at the front to protect it. The gaskets sealing the hatch began to burn, filling the compartment with dangerous fumes and smoke. The deceleration, while normal for reentry, pulled Volynov outward against his harness rather than against the padded seat. As the thermal and aerodynamic stresses on the combined craft increased, struts between the descent and service modules broke off or burned through before the hatch failed. The descent module immediately righted itself once the service module was gone, with the heat shield forward to take the brunt of re-entry.

There was one final problem in store for Volynov when the parachute cables partially tangled and the soft-landing rockets failed, resulting in a hard impact which broke some of his teeth. The capsule came down in the Ural Mountains at of the southwest of Kostanay, near Orenburg, Soviet Union, far short of its target landing site in Kazakhstan. The local temperature was , and knowing that it would be many hours before rescue teams could reach him, Volynov abandoned the capsule and, having spotted smoke rising from a distant chimney, walked for several kilometers to find shelter at a local peasant&#x27;s house. It would be seven years until Volynov flew again, on Soyuz 21.

A similar incident occurred decades later with Soyuz TMA-11 on 19 April 2008, though the latter&#x27;s landing was not as rough.

=== EVA details ===
The mission had extravehicular activity (EVA) objectives similar to those planned for Apollo 9. Soyuz 4 launched first, and was the active vehicle in the docking with Soyuz 5. The news agency TASS stated that: &quot;there was a mutual mechanical coupling of the ships... and their electrical circuits were connected. Thus, the world&#x27;s first experimental cosmic station with four compartments for the crew was assembled and began functioning&quot;.

Moscow TV carried the cosmonauts&#x27; EVA preparations live. Khrunov and Yeliseyev put on their Yastreb (&quot;hawk&quot;) suits in the Soyuz 5 orbital module with aid from commander Boris Volynov. Yastreb suit design commenced in 1965, shortly after Alexei Leonov&#x27;s difficult EVA. Leonov served as a consultant for the design process, which was completed during 1966. Suit fabrication and testing occurred in 1967, but the Soyuz 1 accident in April of that year and Soyuz docking difficulties on the Soyuz 2 and Soyuz 3 missions delayed their use in space until the Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 flights. To prevent the suit from ballooning, the Yastreb suit used a pulley-and-cable articulation system. Wide metal rings around the gray nylon canvas undersuit&#x27;s upper arms served as anchors for the upper body articulation system. The Yastreb had a regenerative life support system in a rectangular white metal box placed on the chest and abdomen to facilitate movement through the Soyuz&#x27;s hatchways.

Volynov checked out Khrunov and Yeliseyev&#x27;s life support and communications systems before returning to the descent module, sealing the hatch, and depressurizing the orbital module. Khrunov went out first, transferring to the Soyuz 4 orbital module while the docked spacecraft were out of radio contact with the Soviet Union over South America. Yeliseyev transferred while the spacecraft were over the Soviet Union. They closed the Soyuz 4 orbital module hatch behind them, then Soyuz 4 commander Vladimir Shatalov repressurised the orbital module and entered to help Khrunov and Yeliseyev get out of their suits. The spacewalkers delivered newspapers, letters, and telegrams printed after Shatalov lifted off to help prove that the transfer took place. Soyuz 4 and 5 separated after only four hours and thirty-five minutes together.

The elephant&#x27;s name and events from his life are recorded in the Carolingian &quot;Annales regni Francorum,&quot; and he is mentioned in Einhard&#x27;s &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot;. However, no references to the gift or to interactions with Charlemagne have been found in Abbasid records.

==Contemporary accounts==
===From the Orient to Europe===
Abul-Abbas was probably born during the 770s or 780s (based on the average age of Asian elephant maturity) and was brought from Baghdad, the capital city of the Abbasid Caliphate, by Charlemagne&#x27;s diplomat Isaac the Jew, who along with two other emissaries, Lantfrid and Sigimund, had been sent to the caliph on Charlemagne&#x27;s orders. That the only surviving member of the group of three, Isaac, was being sent back with the elephant was heralded as advance news to Charlemagne from two emissaries he met in 801: one was sent by the caliph Harun al-Rashid himself, another by Abraham (Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab), who was governor of Africa. Charlemagne then ordered a man to Liguria (the province around Genoa) to commission a fleet of ships to carry the elephant and other goods.

Researchers have speculated on Isaac and the elephant&#x27;s route through Africa: Isaac and the elephant began the trek back by following the Egyptian coast into Ifriqiya, ruled by Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab who had bought the land from al-Rashid for 40,000 dinars annually. Possibly with the help of Ibrahim in the capital city of Kairouan (now in Tunisia), Isaac set sail from port (possibly Carthage, now in Tunisia) with Abul-Abbas and traveled the remaining distance to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea.

At any rate, the strict reading of the historic text &quot;Annales regni Francorum&quot; is that &quot;Isaac the Jew returned from Africa with the elephant&quot; (&quot;Isaac Iudeus de Africa cum elefanto&quot;) and landed in Porto Venere (near Genoa) in October 801. The two spent the winter in Vercelli, and in the spring they started the march over the Alps to the Emperor&#x27;s residence in Aachen, arriving on 20 July 802. Abul Abbas was a full-grown adult elephant.

===Death===
In the year 810, Charlemagne left his palace and mounted a campaign intending to engage with King Gudfred of Denmark and his fleet that invaded and plundered Friesland. Charlemagne had crossed the Rhine River and tarried at a place called &quot;Lippeham&quot; awaiting troops for three days, when his elephant suddenly died. On the tacit assumption that Abul-Abbas was with Charlemagne when he died, some modern commentators venture that the beast had been brought to serve as a war elephant.

===Place of death===
The location of &quot;Lippeham&quot; is a matter of conjecture, but has been placed at the &quot;mouth of the Lippe River&quot; (its confluence with the Rhine), in other words, somewhere near the city of Wesel. The claim dates at least as far back as 1746, (or 1735) when J. H. Nünning (Nunningus) and a colleague had published a notice that &quot;Lippeham&quot; was to be identified with Wesel; and that a colossal bone unearthed from the area, in the possession of their affiliated museum, was plausibly a part of the remains of the elephant Abul-Abbas. Another gigantic bone was found in the Lippe River among a catch of fish in the &quot;herrschaft&quot; of in early 1750, and it too was claimed to be a piece of Abul-Abbas.

One detractor to the claim is Richard Hodges who places it in Lüneburg Heath, which is nowhere near the Rhine.

==Modern embellished accounts==

===Details of exhibition and death===
The &quot;Annales regni Francorum&quot; contain only short reports about the transport of Abul-Abbas (801), his delivery to the Emperor (802) and his death (810). But modern writers have given various embellished accounts. Some indicate that when Abul-Abbas arrived, he was marched through various towns in Germany to the astonishment of onlookers, that he was shown in &quot;Speyer, Strassburg, Verdun, Augsburg, and Paderborn&quot; as ostentatious display of the emperor&#x27;s might, and was eventually housed in Augsburg in what is now southern Bavaria.

Some added details about the elephant&#x27;s death, stating he was in his forties and already suffering from rheumatism when it accompanied Charlemagne in the campaign across the Rhine heading to Friesland. According to these sources, in a spell of &quot;cool rainy weather&quot;, Abul-Abbas developed a case of pneumonia. His keepers were able to transport the beast as far as Münster, where he collapsed and died.

===White elephant===
Some modern works indicate that Abul-Abbas was albino – literally a white elephant – but the basis for the claim is wanting. An early example claiming that Abul-Abbas was a &quot;white elephant&quot; occurs in a title authored by Willis Mason West (1902). In 1971, Peter Munz wrote a book intended for popular readership which repeated the same &quot;white elephant&quot; claim, but a reviewer flagged this as a &quot;slip&quot; given there was &quot;no evidence&quot; known to him to substantiate it. Mention of &quot;white elephant&quot; also misleadingly occurs in the title of the published catalog from the Aachen exhibition of 2003: &quot;Ex oriente : Isaak und der weisse Elefant&quot;, however, in this publication is a contributing article by Grewe and Pohle that appends a question mark on it: &quot;Among the famous gifts to Charlemagne was a (white?) elephant&quot;.

===Abul-Abbas&#x27; species===

A number of authors assert that Abul-Abbas was an Indian elephant, though others cast this as an open question with the African elephant being a distinct possibility. No primary source identifies his species directly.

Arguments for Abul-Abbas having been an Indian elephant include that Abbasid sources such as al-Jahiz and al-Masudi record a belief that African elephants were not tamable. Another clue comes from the Irish monk Dicuil who mentions Abul-Abbas in his description of India in his geographic work &quot;De mensura orbis terrae&quot; (&quot;Concerning the Measurement of the World&quot;) in 825. An inhabited initial B from a copy of Cassiodorus&#x27; &quot;Commentary on the Psalms&quot; made at the Abbey of Saint-Denis in the first quarter of the ninth century (now Paris, BnF lat. 2195) incorporates an elephant&#x27;s head. The realistic portrayal of an Asian elephant suggests that the artist had seen Abul-Abbas.

Evidence put forward for Abul-Abbas having been an African elephant includes the route by which he arrived in Europe, which was via Tunisia. Also, a Carolingian plaque survives which was manufactured from ivory from an African elephant and was from a contemporary source. Ivory was widely used in Carolingian art, but most of this material was re-purposed from Roman sources. This particular plaque, a depiction of the Virgin Mary is too large to have come from the tusk of an Indian elephant, measuring along its longest side. Radio-carbon dating shows that the ivory in the plaque is not of ancient origin. For Carolingian artists to have access to new ivory is so unusual that it makes Abul-Abbas a possible source of the material.

A short story by the German-New Zealand author Norman Franke tells the biography of the elephant from his own point of view.

<doc id="187688" wikidata="Q180903" url="?curid=187688" title="Natsume Sōseki">
<text>, pen name Sōseki, born , was a Japanese novelist. He is best known for his novels &quot;Kokoro&quot;, &quot;Botchan&quot;, &quot;I Am a Cat&quot;, &quot;Kusamakura&quot; and his unfinished work &quot;Light and Darkness&quot;. He was also a scholar of British literature and writer of haiku, &quot;kanshi&quot; poetry and fairy tales.

==Early years==
Natsume Kin&#x27;nosuke was born on 9 February 1867 in the town of Babashita, Ushigome, Edo (present Kikui, Shinjuku, Tokyo), the fifth son of village head (&quot;nanushi&quot;) Natsume Kohē Naokatsu and his wife Chie. His father, a powerful and wealthy &quot;nanushi&quot;, owned all land from Ushigome to Takadanobaba in Edo and handled most civil lawsuits at his doorstep. He was a descendant of Natsume Yoshinobu, a Sengoku period samurai and retainer of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Sōseki began his life as an unwanted child, born to his mother late in her life, forty years old and his father then fifty-three. When he was born, he already had five siblings. Having five children and a toddler had created family insecurity and was in some ways a disgrace to the Natsume family. A childless couple, Shiobara Masanosuke and his wife, adopted him in 1868 and raised him until the age of nine, when the couple divorced. He returned to his biological family and was welcomed by his mother although regarded as a nuisance by his father. His mother died when he was fourteen, and his two eldest brothers died in 1887, intensifying his sense of insecurity.

Sōseki attended the First Tokyo Middle School (now Hibiya High School), where he became deeply enamored with Chinese literature, and fancied that he might someday become a writer. His desire to become an author arose when he was about fifteen when he told his older brother about his interest in literature. However, his family disapproved strongly of this course of action, and when Sōseki entered the Tokyo Imperial University in September 1884, it was with the intention of becoming an architect. Although he preferred Chinese classics, he started studying English at that time, feeling that it might prove useful to him in his future career, as English was a necessity in Japanese college.

In 1887, Sōseki met Masaoka Shiki, a friend who would give him encouragement on the path to becoming a writer, which would ultimately be his career. Shiki tutored him in the art of composing haiku. From this point on, he began signing his poems with the epithet &quot;Sōseki&quot;, a Chinese idiom meaning &quot;stubborn&quot;. In 1890, he entered the English Literature department, and quickly mastered the English language. In 1891 he produced a partial English translation of the classical work &quot;Hōjōki&quot; upon request by his then English literature professor James Main Dixon. Sōseki graduated in 1893, and enrolled for some time as a graduate student and part-time teacher at the Tokyo Normal School.

In 1895, Sōseki began teaching at Matsuyama Middle School in Shikoku, which later became the setting of his novel &quot;Botchan&quot;. Along with fulfilling his teaching duties, Sōseki published haiku and Chinese poetry in a number of newspapers and periodicals. He resigned his post in 1896, and began teaching at the Fifth High School in Kumamoto (now part of Kumamoto University). On June 10 of that year, he married Nakane Kyōko.

==In the United Kingdom, 1900–1902==

In 1900, the Japanese government sent Sōseki to study in Great Britain as &quot;Japan&#x27;s first Japanese English literary scholar&quot;. He visited Cambridge and stayed a night there, but gave up the idea of studying at the university because he could not afford it on his government scholarship. He studied instead at University College London (UCL). He had a miserable time in London, spending most of his days indoors buried in books, and his friends feared that he might be losing his mind. He also visited Pitlochry in Scotland, where he lodged with John Henry Dixon at the Dundarach Hotel.

He lived in four different lodgings: 76 Gower Street, near the British Museum; 85 Priory Road, West Hampstead; 6 Flodden Road, Camberwell; and 81 The Chase, Clapham (see the photograph). Only the last of these addresses, where he lodged with Priscilla Leale and her sister Elizabeth, proved satisfactory. Five years later, in his preface to &quot;Bungakuron&quot; (&quot;The Criticism of Literature&quot;), he wrote about the period:
He got along well with Priscilla, who shared his love of literature, notably Shakespeare and Milton (his tutor at UCL was the Shakespeare scholar W. J. Craig), and who also spoke fluent French, much to his admiration. The Leales were a Channel Island family, and Priscilla had been born in France. The sisters worried about Sōseki&#x27;s incipient paranoia and successfully urged him to get out more and take up cycling.

Despite his poverty, loneliness, and mental torment, he consolidated his knowledge of English literature during this period and left the United Kingdom in December 1902, returning to the Empire of Japan in January 1903. In April he was appointed to the First National College in Tokyo. Also, he was given the lectureship in English literature, subsequently replacing Koizumi Yakumo (Lafcadio Hearn) and ultimately becoming a professor of English literature at the Tokyo Imperial University, where he taught literary theory and literary criticism.

==Literary career==
Sōseki&#x27;s literary career began in 1903, when he began to contribute haiku, &quot;renku&quot; (haiku-style linked verse), &quot;haitaishi&quot; (linked verse on a set theme) and literary sketches to literary magazines, such as the prominent &quot;Hototogisu,&quot; edited by his former mentor Masaoka Shiki, and later by Takahama Kyoshi. However, it was the public success of his satirical novel &quot;I Am a Cat&quot; in 1905 that won him wide public admiration as well as critical acclaim.

He followed on this success with short stories, such as &quot;Rondon tō&quot; (&quot;Tower of London&quot;) in 1905 and the novels &quot;Botchan&quot; (&quot;Little Master&quot;), and &quot;Kusamakura&quot; (&quot;Grass Pillow&quot;) in 1906, which established his reputation, and which enabled him to leave his post at the university for a position with &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; in 1907, and to begin writing full-time. Much of his work deals with the relation between Japanese culture and Western culture. His early works in particular are influenced by his studies in London; his novel &quot;Kairo-kō&quot; was the earliest and only major prose treatment of the Arthurian legend in Japanese. He began writing one novel a year before his death from a stomach ulcer in 1916. After his death, his brain and stomach were donated to the University of Tokyo, and his brain has been preserved as a specimen there.
Major themes in Sōseki&#x27;s works include economic hardship, conflicts between duty and desire, and the rapid Westernization and industrialization of Japan. Sōseki took a strong interest in the writers of the &quot;Shirakaba&quot; (White Birch) literary group. In his final years, authors such as Akutagawa Ryūnosuke and Kume Masao became close followers of his literary style as his disciples.

==Legacy==

In the 21st century, there has been a global emergence of interest in Sōseki. Sōseki&#x27;s &quot;Kokoro&quot; has been newly published in 10 languages, such as Arabic, Slovenian and Dutch, since 2001. &quot;Kokoro&quot; also holds the distinction as the best-selling &quot;bunkobon&quot; in Japan, having sold over seven million copies in the country as of 2016. From 1984 until 2004, his portrait appeared on the front of the Japanese 1,000 yen note.

In South Korea, the complete collection of Sōseki&#x27;s long works began to be published in 2013. In English-speaking countries there has been a succession of English translations since 2008. About 60 of his works have been translated into more than 30 languages. Reasons for this emergence of global interest have been attributed in part to Haruki Murakami who said Sōseki was his favorite Japanese writer. Political scientist and principal of Seigakuin University Kang Sang-jung argued that &quot;Soseki predicted the problems we are facing today [and] had a long-term view of civilization,&quot; suggesting that &quot;[h]is popularity will become more global in the future&quot;.

In 2016, the centennial of Sōseki&#x27;s death, Nishogakusha University in Tokyo collaborated with Hiroshi Ishiguro, robotics researcher at Osaka University, to create a robotic android version of Sōseki. Sōseki&#x27;s grandson, Fusanosuke Natsume, voiced the 130 cm figure which depicted Sōseki at age 45. The robot gave lectures and recitations of Sōseki&#x27;s works at the university, as a way to engage students&#x27; interest in literature.

In 2017, as part of the 150-year commemoration of Sōseki&#x27;s birth, the Asahi Beer Oyamazaki Villa Museum of Art displayed the letter Sōseki had written suggesting names for the villa itself. Sōseki had been on good terms with the owner, Shotaro Kaga, who asked him to name the house. Sōseki died before its completion in 1917. Sōseki&#x27;s diary was also on display during the exhibition. In June 2019, retired professor Ikuo Tsunematsu reopened the Sōseki Museum, in Surrey, dedicated to the writer&#x27;s life in the United Kingdom. The museum originally opened in 1982 in London, but closed in 2016 due to high maintenance costs and a decreased rate of attendance. The collection includes over 10,000 items including works in translation, collected books and magazines from Sōseki&#x27;s stay in London, and census records.

<doc id="187689" wikidata="Q1121988" url="?curid=187689" title="CTAN">
<text>CTAN (an acronym for &quot;Comprehensive TeX Archive Network&quot;) is the authoritative place where TeX-related material and software can be found for download. Repositories for other projects, such as the MiKTeX distribution of TeX, constantly mirror most of CTAN.

==History==
Before CTAN there were a number of people who made some TeX materials available for public download, but there was no systematic collection. At a podium discussion that Joachim Schrod organized at the 1991 EuroTeX conference, the idea arose to bring together the separate collections. (Joachim was interested in this topic because he is active in the TeX community since 1983 and ran one of the largest ftp servers in Germany at that time.)

CTAN was built in 1992, by Rainer Schöpf and Joachim Schrod in Germany, Sebastian Rahtz in the UK, and George Greenwade in the U.S. (George came up with the name).. The site structure was put together at the start of 1992 – Sebastian did the main work – and synchronized at the start of 1993. The TeX Users Group provided a framework, a Technical Working Group, for this task&#x27;s organization. CTAN was officially announced at the EuroTeX conference at Aston University, 1993. 

The English site has been stable since the beginning, but both the American and the German sites have moved thrice. The American site was first at Sam Houston State University under George Greenwade, in 1995 it moved to UMass Boston where it was run by Karl Berry. In 1999 it moved to Saint Michael&#x27;s College in Colchester, Vermont. There it was announced to go off-line in the end of January 2011. Since January 2013, a mirror has been hosted by the University of Utah (no upload node). The German site was first at the University of Heidelberg, operated by Rainer; in 1999 it moved to the University of Mainz, also operated by Rainer; 2002 to the University of Hamburg, operated by Reinhard Zierke; finally in 2005 it moved to a commercial hosting company since the amount of traffic got too high to get sponsored by a university. The German site is subsidized by DANTE e.V., the Deutschsprachige Anwendervereinigung TeX.

Since 2021 there are four people who maintain the archives and the TeX catalogue updates: Erik Braun, Ina Dau, Manfred Lotz, and Petra Ruebe-Pugliese. The web server itself is maintained by Gerd Neugebauer. The main CTAN nodes serve downloads of more than 6 TB per month, not counting its 94 mirror sites worldwide.

<doc id="187696" wikidata="Q61027305" url="?curid=187696" title="The Beatles albums discography">
<text>Worldwide, the English rock band the Beatles released 12 studio albums (17 in the US), 5 live albums, 49 compilation albums, 36 extended plays (EPs), and 37 box sets. In their native United Kingdom, during their active existence as a band, they released 12 studio albums (including 1 double album), 1 compilation album, and 13 EPs (including 1 double EP). The early albums released from 1962 to March 1968 were originally on Parlophone, and their albums from August 1968 to 1970 were on their subsidiary label Apple. Their output also includes vault items, remixed mash-ups and anniversary box-sets.

The Beatles are the biggest selling band of all time, selling over 500 million records. With the first CD releases of their albums in 1987 and 1988, the Beatles&#x27; core catalogue was harmonised worldwide to encompass their 12 original UK studio albums, the 1967 US &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; album and the newly assembled &quot;Past Masters: Volumes One and Two&quot; compilation albums consisting of all the studio recordings released during 1962 to 1970 that are not present on the UK studio albums or &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; (mainly non-album singles, B-sides and EP tracks). When the core catalogue was reissued in remastered editions in 2009, the two volumes of &quot;Past Masters&quot; were combined into one double album. Since then, other past releases have been reissued in digital formats and on vinyl. The catalogue is currently distributed by Universal Music Enterprises&#x27; Calderstone Productions. This core catalogue contains all 217 tracks intended for commercial release, either as album tracks, EP tracks, or singles, that were put out by the Beatles from 1962 to 1970.

The Beatles&#x27; international discography is more complicated due to different versions of their albums sometimes being released in other countries, particularly during their early years on Capitol Records in North America. Prior to 1967, it was common practice for British releases to be reconfigured for the American market. The first seven British Beatles albums were converted into ten LPs for the American market, adding material from singles and the UK EPs; the band were unhappy with these reconfigurations. With the exception of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, studio releases from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; in 1967 forward were uniform in both the UK and the US. The band&#x27;s first eight albums were released on Parlophone. From 1968, in both the UK and the US, starting with the single &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and the album &quot;The Beatles&quot; (better known as &quot;the White Album&quot;), new releases appeared on the Beatles&#x27; own Apple record label, although Parlophone and Capitol catalogue numbers continued to be used for contractual reasons.

The Beatles&#x27; discography was originally released on the vinyl format, with full-length long plays (LPs), shorter EPs and singles. Over the years, the collection has also been released on cassette, 8-track, compact disc (CD), on a USB flash drive in MP3 and 24-bit FLAC format, and on digital media streaming services. The Beatles&#x27; UK discography was first released on CD in 1987 and 1988. Between 1962 and 1968, the Beatles released their songs in both mono and stereo versions. The band&#x27;s catalogue was remastered in both mono and stereo in 2009.

<doc id="187697" wikidata="Q749212" url="?curid=187697" title="Gentleman">
<text>Gentleman (Old French: &quot;gentilz hom&quot;, gentle + man; abbreviated &quot;gent.&quot;) is a term for a chivalrous, courteous, or honorable man. Originally, &quot;gentleman&quot; was the lowest rank of the landed gentry of England, ranking below an esquire and above a yeoman; by definition, the rank of &quot;gentleman&quot; comprised the younger sons of the younger sons of peers, and the younger sons of a baronet, a knight, and an esquire, in perpetual succession. As such, the connotation of the term &quot;gentleman&quot; captures the common denominator of gentility (and often a coat of arms); a right shared by the peerage and the gentry, the constituent classes of the British nobility.

Thus, the English social category of &quot;gentleman&quot; corresponds to the French &quot;gentilhomme&quot; (nobleman), which in Great Britain meant a member of the peerage of England. English historian Maurice Keen further clarifies this point, stating that, in this context, the social category of gentleman is &quot;the nearest contemporary English equivalent of the &quot;noblesse&quot; of France.&quot; In the 14th century, the term &quot;gentlemen&quot; comprised the hereditary ruling class, which is whom the rebels of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt (1381) meant when they repeated:

In the 17th century, in &quot;Titles of Honour&quot; (1614), the jurist John Selden said that the title &quot;gentleman&quot; likewise speaks of &quot;our English use of it&quot; as convertible with &quot;nobilis&quot; (nobility by rank or personal quality) and describes the forms of a man&#x27;s elevation to the nobility in European monarchies. In the 19th century, James Henry Lawrence explained and discussed the concepts, particulars, and functions of social rank in a monarchy, in the book &quot;On the Nobility of the British Gentry, or the Political Ranks and Dignities of the British Empire, Compared with those on the Continent&quot; (1827).

==Gentleman by conduct==

In &quot;The Tale of Melibee&quot; (), Geoffrey Chaucer says: &quot;Certes he sholde not be called a gentil man, that . . . ne dooth his diligence and bisynesse, to kepen his good name&quot;; and in &quot;The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1388-1396):

&lt;poem&gt;Loke who that is most vertuous alway
Prive and apert, and most entendeth ay
To do the gentil dedes that he can
And take him for the gretest gentilman&lt;/poem&gt;

In the French allegorical poem &quot;The Romance of the Rose&quot; (ca. 1400), Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun described the innate character of a gentleman: &quot;He is gentil bycause he doth as longeth to a gentilman.&quot; That definition develops until the 18th century, when in 1710, in the &quot;Tatler&quot; No. 207, Richard Steele said that &quot;the appellation of Gentleman is never to be affixed to a man&#x27;s circumstances, but to his Behaviour in them.&quot; Hence, the apocryphal reply of King James II of England to a lady&#x27;s petition to elevate her son to the rank of gentleman: &quot;I could make him a nobleman, but God Almighty could not make him a gentleman.&quot;

Selden said &quot;that no Charter can make a Gentleman, which is cited as out of the mouth of some great Princes [who] have said it,&quot; because &quot;they, without question, understood Gentleman for &quot;Generosus&quot; in the antient sense, or as if it came from &quot;Genii/[Geni]&quot; in that sense.&quot; The word &quot;gentilis&quot; identifies a man of noble family, a gentleman by birth, for &quot;no creation could make a man of another blood than he is.&quot; In contemporary usage, the word &quot;gentleman&quot; is ambiguously defined, because &quot;to behave like a gentleman&quot; communicates as little praise or as much criticism as the speaker means to imply; thus, &quot;to spend money like a gentleman&quot; is criticism, but &quot;to conduct a business like a gentleman&quot; is praise.

===William Harrison===
In the 16th century, the clergyman William Harrison said that &quot;gentlemen be those whom their race and blood, or at the least their virtues, do make noble and known.&quot; In that time, a gentleman usually was expected to have a coat of arms, it being accepted that only a gentleman could have a coat of arms, as indicated in an account of how gentlemen were made in the day of William Shakespeare:

Gentlemen whose ancestors are not known to come in with William duke of Normandy (for of the Saxon races yet remaining we now make none accompt, much less of the British issue) do take their beginning in England after this manner in our times. Who soever studieth the laws of the realm, who so abideth in the university, giving his mind to his book, or professeth physic and the liberal sciences, or beside his service in the room of a captain in the wars, or good counsel given at home, whereby his commonwealth is benefited, can live without manual labour, and thereto is able and will bear the port, charge and countenance of a gentleman, he shall for money have a coat and arms bestowed upon him by heralds (who in the charter of the same do of custom pretend antiquity and service) and thereunto being made so good cheap be called master, which is the title that men give to esquires and gentlemen, and reputed for a gentleman ever after. Which is so much the less to be disallowed of, for that the prince doth lose nothing by it, the gentleman being so much subject to taxes and public payments as is the yeoman or husbandman, which he likewise doth bear the gladlier for the saving of his reputation. Being called also to the wars (for with the government of the commonwealth he medleth little) what soever it cost him, he will both array and arm himself accordingly, and show the more manly courage, and all the tokens of the person which he representeth. No man hath hurt by it but himself, who peradventure will go in wider buskins than his legs will bear, or as our proverb saith, now and then bear a bigger sail than his boat is able to sustain.

===William Shakespeare===
In this way, William Shakespeare himself was demonstrated, by the grant of his coat of arms, to be no &quot;vagabond&quot;, but a gentleman. The inseparability of arms and gentility is shown by two of his characters:

&lt;poem&gt;Petruchio: I swear I&#x27;ll cuff you if you strike again.
Katharine: So may you lose your arms: If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
:—&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Act II, Scene i&lt;/poem&gt;

However, although only a gentleman could have a coat of arms (so that possession of a coat of arms was proof of gentility), the coat of arms recognised, rather than created, the status (see G. D. Squibb, &quot;The High Court of Chivalry&quot;, pp. 170–177). Thus, all armigers were gentlemen, but not all gentlemen were armigers. Hence, &quot;Henry V&quot;, act IV, scene iii:

&lt;poem&gt;For he today that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother: be he ne&#x27;er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition.
And gentlemen in England now abed
Shall think themselves accurs&#x27;d they were not here
And hold their manhoods cheap whilst any speaks
That fought with us upon St. Crispin&#x27;s Day.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Superiority of the fighting man===
The fundamental idea of &quot;gentry&quot;, symbolised in this grant of coat-armour, had come to be that of the essential superiority of the fighting man, and, as Selden points out (page 707), the fiction was usually maintained in the granting of arms &quot;to an ennobled person though of the long Robe wherein he hath little use of them as they mean a shield.&quot; At the last, the wearing of a sword on all occasions was the outward and visible sign of a gentleman; the custom survives in the sword worn with court dress.

A suggestion that a gentleman &quot;must&quot; have a coat of arms was vigorously advanced by certain 19th and 20th century heraldists, notably Arthur Charles Fox-Davies in England and Thomas Innes of Learney in Scotland. The suggestion is discredited by an examination, in England, of the records of the High Court of Chivalry and, in Scotland, by a judgment of the Court of Session (per Lord Mackay in &quot;Maclean of Ardgour v. Maclean&quot; [1941] SC 613 at 650). The significance of a right to a coat of arms was that it was definitive proof of the status of gentleman, but it recognised rather than conferred such a status, and the status could be and frequently was accepted without a right to a coat of arms.

===Confucianism===

In East Asia, the characteristics of a gentleman are based upon the principles of Confucianism, wherein the term &quot;Jūnzǐ&quot; (君子) denotes and identifies the &quot;son of a ruler&quot;, a &quot;prince&quot;, a &quot;noble man&quot;; and the ideals that conceptually define &quot;gentleman&quot;, &quot;proper man&quot;, and a &quot;perfect man&quot;. Conceptually, &quot;Jūnzǐ&quot; included an hereditary elitism, which obliged the gentleman to act ethically, to:

* morally cultivate himself;
* participate in the correct performance of ritual;
* show filial piety and loyalty to whom due; and
* cultivate humanity.

The opposite of the &quot;Jūnzǐ&quot; is the &quot;Xiǎorén&quot; (小人), &quot;petty person&quot; and &quot;small person&quot;. As in English, in the Chinese usage the word &quot;small&quot;, can denote and connote a person who is &quot;mean&quot;, &quot;petty in mind and heart&quot;, and &quot;narrowly self-interested&quot;, greedy, materialistic, and personally superficial.

===Southern United States===

The Southern gentleman of the Antebellum South was expected to protect the honor and property of both himself and his family members, acting as a chivalric ideal of the white planter class supposedly descended from the knights and cavaliers of the medieval and colonial eras.

Robert E. Lee&#x27;s definition speaks only to conduct.
The forbearing use of power does not only form a touchstone, but the manner in which an individual enjoys certain advantages over others is a test of a true gentleman.

The power which the strong have over the weak, the employer over the employed, the educated over the unlettered, the experienced over the confiding, even the clever over the silly—the forbearing or inoffensive use of all this power or authority, or a total abstinence from it when the case admits it, will show the gentleman in a plain light.

The gentleman does not needlessly and unnecessarily remind an offender of a wrong he may have committed against him. He can not only forgive, he can forget; and he strives for that nobleness of self and mildness of character which impart sufficient strength to let the past be but the past. A true man of honor feels humbled himself when he cannot help humbling others. As quoted by 

Lee&#x27;s conception is one of the better known expositions in favor of the Southern culture of honor.

==Landed gentry==

That a distinct order of landed gentry existed in England very early has, indeed, been often assumed and is supported by weighty authorities. Thus, the late Professor Freeman (in &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; xvii. page 540 b, 9th edition) said: &quot;Early in the 11th century the order of &#x27;gentlemen&#x27; as a separate class seems to be forming as something new. By the time of the conquest of England the distinction seems to have been fully established.&quot; Stubbs (Const. Hist., ed. 1878, iii. 544, 548) takes the same view. Sir George Sitwell, however, has suggested that this opinion is based on a wrong conception of the conditions of medieval society and that it is wholly opposed to the documentary evidence.

The most basic class distinctions in the Middle Ages were between the &quot;nobiles&quot;, i.e., the tenants in chivalry, such as earls, barons, knights, esquires, the free &quot;ignobiles&quot; such as the citizens and burgesses, and franklins, and the unfree peasantry including villeins and serfs. Even as late as 1400, the word &quot;gentleman&quot; still only had the descriptive sense of &quot;generosus&quot; and could not be used as denoting the title of a class. Yet after 1413, we find it increasingly so used, and the list of landowners in 1431, printed in &quot;Feudal Aids&quot;, contains, besides knights, esquires, yeomen and husbandmen (i.e. householders), a fair number who are classed as &quot;gentilman&quot;.

===George Sitwell===
Sir George Sitwell gave a lucid, instructive and occasionally amusing explanation of this development. The immediate cause was the statute 1 Hen. 5. c. 5. of 1413, which laid down that in all original writs of action, personal appeals and indictments, in which process of outlawry lies, the &quot;estate degree or mystery&quot; of the defendant must be stated, as well as his present or former domicile. At this time, the Black Death (1349) had put the traditional social organization out of gear. Before that, the younger sons of the nobles had received their share of the farm stock, bought or hired land, and settled down as agriculturists in their native villages. Under the new conditions, this became increasingly impossible, and they were forced to seek their fortunes abroad in the French wars, or at home as hangers-on of the great nobles. These men, under the old system, had no definite status; but they were &quot;generosi&quot;, men of birth, and, being now forced to describe themselves, they disdained to be classed with franklins (now sinking in the social scale), still more with yeomen or husbandmen; they chose, therefore, to be described as &quot;gentlemen&quot;.

On the character of these earliest gentlemen the records throw a lurid light. Sir George Sitwell (p. 76), describes a man typical of his class, one who had served among the men-at-arms of Lord John Talbot at the Battle of Agincourt:

the premier gentleman of England, as the matter now stands, is &quot;Robert Ercleswyke of Stafford, gentilman&quot;...

Fortunately—for the gentle reader will no doubt be anxious to follow in his footsteps—some particulars of his life may be gleaned from the public records. He was charged at the Staffordshire Assizes with housebreaking, wounding with intent to kill, and procuring the murder of one Thomas Page, who was cut to pieces while on his knees begging for his life.

If any earlier claimant to the title of &quot;gentleman&quot; be discovered, Sir George Sitwell predicted that it will be within the same year (1414) and in connection with some similar disreputable proceedings.

From these unpromising beginnings, the separate order of gentlemen evolved very slowly. The first gentleman commemorated on an existing monument was John Daundelyon of Margate (died &quot;circa&quot; 1445); the first gentleman to enter the House of Commons, hitherto composed mainly of &quot;valets&quot;, was William Weston, &quot;gentylman&quot;; but even in the latter half of the 15th century, the order was not clearly established. As to the connection of &quot;gentilesse&quot; with the official grant or recognition of coat-armour, that is a profitable fiction invented and upheld by the heralds; for coat-armour was the badge assumed by gentlemen to distinguish them in battle, and many gentlemen of long descent never had occasion to assume it and never did.

====Further decline of standards====
This fiction, however, had its effect, and by the 16th century, as has been already pointed out, the official view had become clearly established that gentlemen constituted a distinct social order and that the badge of this distinction was the heralds&#x27; recognition of the right to bear arms. However, some undoubtedly &quot;gentle&quot; families of long descent never obtained official rights to bear a coat of arms, the family of Strickland being an example, which caused some consternation when Lord Strickland applied to join the Order of Malta in 1926 and could prove no right to a coat of arms, although his direct male ancestor had carried the English royal banner of St. George at the Battle of Agincourt.

The younger sons of noble families became apprentices in the cities, and there grew up a new aristocracy of trade. Merchants are still &quot;citizens&quot; to William Harrison; but he adds &quot;they often change estate with gentlemen, as gentlemen do with them, by a mutual conversion of the one into the other.&quot;

===A line between classes===
A frontier line between classes so indefinite could not be maintained in some societies such as England, where there was never a &quot;nobiliary prefix&quot; to stamp a person as a gentleman, as opposed to France or Germany. The process was hastened, moreover, by the corruption of the Heralds&#x27; College and by the ease with which coats of arms could be assumed without a shadow of claim, which tended to bring the science of heraldry into contempt.

The prefix &quot;de&quot; attached to some English names is in no sense &quot;nobiliary&quot;. In Latin documents &quot;de&quot; was the equivalent of the English &quot;of&quot;, as &quot;de la&quot; for &quot;at&quot; (so &quot;de la Pole&quot; for &quot;Atte Poole&quot;; compare such names as &quot;Attwood&quot; or &quot;Attwater&quot;). In English this &quot;of&quot; disappeared during the 15th century: for example the grandson of &quot;Johannes de Stoke&quot; (John of Stoke) in a 14th-century document becomes &quot;John Stoke&quot;. In modern times, under the influence of romanticism, the prefix &quot;de&quot; has been in some cases &quot;revived&quot; under a misconception, e.g. &quot;de Trafford&quot;, &quot;de Hoghton&quot;. Very rarely it is correctly retained as derived from a foreign place-name, e.g. &quot;de Grey&quot;. The situation varies somewhat in Scotland, where the territorial designation still exists and its use is regulated by law.

With the growth of trade and the Industrial Revolution from 1700 to 1900, the term widened to include men of the urban professional classes: lawyers, doctors and even merchants. By 1841, the rules of the new gentlemen&#x27;s club at Ootacamund was to include: &quot;...gentlemen of the Mercantile or other professions, moving in the ordinary circle of Indian society&quot;.

==Formal court titles==

At several monarchs&#x27; courts, various functions bear titles containing such rank designations as gentleman (suggesting it is to be filled by a member of the lower nobility, or a commoner who will be ennobled, while the highest posts are often reserved for the higher nobility). In English, the terms for the English/Scottish/British court (equivalents may include Lady for women, Page for young men) include:
* Gentleman at Arms
* Gentleman-in-waiting
* Gentleman of the bedchamber
*Gentleman of the Chapel Royal
* Gentleman-usher

In France, gentilhomme
* ... rendered as &quot;gentleman-in-ordinary&quot;
* ... as gentleman of the bed-chamber

In Spain, e.g., &quot;Gentilhombre de la casa del príncipe&quot;, &quot;gentleman of the house[hold] of the prince&quot;

Such positions can occur in the household of a non-member of a ruling family, such as a prince of the church:
* Gentiluomo of the Archbishop of Westminster

==Modern usage==

The word &quot;gentleman&quot; as an index of rank had already become of doubtful value before the great political and social changes of the 19th century gave to it a wider and essentially higher significance. The change is well illustrated in the definitions given in the successive editions of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. In the 5th edition (1815), &quot;a gentleman is one, who without any title, bears a coat of arms, or whose ancestors have been .&quot; In the 7th edition (1845) it still implies a definite social status: &quot;All above the rank of yeomen.&quot; In the 8th edition (1856), this is still its &quot;most extended sense&quot;; &quot;in a more limited sense&quot; it is defined in the same words as those quoted above from the 5th edition; but the writer adds, &quot;By courtesy this title is generally accorded to all persons above the rank of common tradesmen when their manners are indicative of a certain amount of refinement and intelligence.&quot;

The Reform Act 1832 did its work; the middle classes came into their own, and the word &quot;gentleman&quot; came in common use to signify not a distinction of blood, but a distinction of position, education and manners.
By this usage, the test is no longer good birth or the right to bear arms, but the capacity to mingle on equal terms in good society.

In its best use, moreover, &quot;gentleman&quot; involves a certain superior standard of conduct, due, to quote the 8th edition once more, to &quot;that self-respect and intellectual refinement which manifest themselves in unrestrained yet delicate manners.&quot; The word &quot;gentle&quot;, originally implying a certain social status, had very early come to be associated with the standard of manners expected from that status. Thus, by a sort of punning process, the &quot;gentleman&quot; becomes a &quot;gentle-man&quot;.

In another sense, being a gentleman means treating others, especially women, in a respectful manner and not taking advantage or pushing others into doing things they do not wish to do. The exception, of course, is to push someone into something they need to do for their own good, such as a visit to the hospital, or pursuing a dream they have suppressed.

In some cases, its meaning becomes twisted through misguided efforts to avoid offending anyone; a news report of a riot may refer to a &quot;gentleman&quot; trying to smash a window with a dustbin in order to loot a store. Similar use (notably between quotation marks or in an appropriate tone) may also be deliberate irony.

Another relatively recent usage of &quot;gentleman&quot; is as a prefix to another term to imply that a man has sufficient wealth and free time to pursue an area of interest without depending on it for his livelihood. Examples include gentleman scientist, gentleman farmer, gentleman architect, and gentleman pirate. A very specific incarnation and possible origin of this practise existed until 1962 in cricket, where a man playing the game was a &quot;gentleman cricketer&quot; if he did not get a salary for taking part in the game. By tradition, such gentlemen were from the British &quot;gentry&quot; or aristocracy - as opposed to &quot;players&quot;, who were not. In the same way in horse racing a gentleman rider is an amateur jockey, racing horses in specific flat and hurdle races.

The term &quot;gentleman&quot; is used in the United States&#x27; Uniform Code of Military Justice in a provision referring to &quot;conduct befitting an officer and a gentleman.&quot;

The use of the term &quot;gentleman&quot; is a central concept in many books of American Literature: &quot;Adrift in New York&quot;, by Horatio Alger; &quot;&quot;Fraternity: A Romance of Inspiration&quot;, by Anonymous, with a tipped in Letter from J.P. Morgan (1836); &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, by Margaret Mitchell (1936). It relates to education and manners, a certain code of conduct regarding women that has been incorporated in the U.S. into various civil rights laws and anti-sexual-harassment laws that define a code of conduct to be followed by law in the workplace. Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; states &quot;You&#x27;re no gentleman&quot; on occasions when a lack of manners and respect toward her causes her to feel insulted.

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen&quot; is a common salutation used in formal speeches and other public addresses, sometimes followed by &quot;boys and girls&quot;.

=== Gentlemen as members of the nobility ===
In its original, nobiliary sense, the term &quot;Gentleman&quot; is still used by the Commission and Association for the Armigerous Families of Great Britain, Britain&#x27;s CILANE member association, as well as those orders of chivalry that require nobility for admission to their higher grades. Gentlemen in this sense form the lowest rank of the British historical nobility. It is the only social rank in Britain that is transmissible to all (male-line) descendants, not just by primogeniture. The class of Gentlemen under this definition usually consists of Gentlemen Armigers, i.e. all those who are entitled to armorial bearings, through grant or inheritance. As arms are still granted by the College of Arms and Lord Lyon, the British gentry remains open to new families unlike its Continental equivalents, which are usually not renewed by new ennoblements anymore either because the monarchy that would have the right to do so has been abolished or because the government has adopted a policy of treating the nobility as a closed and purely historical class.

Gentlemen possess gentility, that is, the condition corresponding to untitled nobility on the Continent. A grant of arms, at least in the English sense, does not &quot;confer&quot; gentility but rather &quot;confirms&quot; that it has been earned or demonstrated by the recipient. The evalutation of eligibility for a grant is, in fact, a test of gentility. Practically, this means that a grant of arms will consolidate gentility which has been acquired under one of the above definitions and turn it into a hereditary quality that is henceforth demonstrated by the grantee&#x27;s descendants by proving the right to inherited arms (or, in Scotland, to matriculate a differenced version of his arms).

Gentility is also automatically accorded with certain offices and ranks, such as that of a barrister. It is however not hereditary in that case, and will not suffice for admission to most strictly &quot;noble&quot; organisations, unless a grant of arms is sought which gives hereditary gentility.

Formal gentility is of less social importance on the British Isles than on the Continent, and it is but one of the many factors that determine membership in the upper classes. However, those who belong to the upper or upper middle class are typically eligible for a grant of arms should they apply for it, and would then be able to use it as a formal proof of status in the Continental context.

<doc id="187698" wikidata="Q473768" url="?curid=187698" title="Amniocentesis">
<text>Amniocentesis is a medical procedure used primarily in the prenatal diagnosis of genetic conditions. It has other uses such as in the assessment of infection and fetal lung maturity. Prenatal diagnostic testing, which includes amniocentesis, is necessary to conclusively diagnose the majority of genetic disorders, with amniocentesis being the gold-standard procedure after 15 weeks&#x27; gestation.

In this procedure, a thin needle is inserted into the abdomen of the pregnant woman. The needle punctures the amnion, which is the membrane that surrounds the developing fetus. The fluid within the amnion is called amniotic fluid, and because this fluid surrounds the developing fetus, it contains fetal cells. The amniotic fluid is sampled and analyzed via methods such as karyotyping and DNA analysis technology for genetic abnormalities.

An amniocentesis is typically performed in the second trimester between the 15th and 20th week of gestation. Women who choose to have this test are primarily those at increased risk for genetic and chromosomal problems, in part because the test is invasive and carries a small risk of pregnancy loss. However, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all women be offered prenatal assessment for aneuploidy, or the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, by either genetic screening or diagnostic testing independent of maternal age or risk factors. There are relative contraindications to performing an amniocentesis, however no absolute contraindications have been identified.

Physicians have used the process of inserting a needle transabdominal into the uterus to extract amniotic fluid for the management of hydramnios, or excess amniotic fluid, as early as the late 1800s.

==Medical uses==
Amniocentesis may be performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic reasons.

=== Diagnostic indications ===

==== Genetic diagnosis ====
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all women be offered prenatal assessment for aneuploidy by either genetic screening or diagnostic testing independent of maternal age or risk factors. Prenatal genetic screening is intended to identify patients who are at increased risk of having a fetus with a genetic condition while prenatal genetic diagnostic testing detects whether a specific genetic condition is present in the fetus with high accuracy. Amniocentesis, along with chorionic villus sampling, are examples of prenatal diagnostic tests. Amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling is necessary to conclusively diagnose the majority of genetic disorders, with amniocentesis being the gold-standard procedure after 15 weeks&#x27; gestation. Transabdominal chorionic villus sampling is an alternative to amniocentesis if genetic diagnostic testing is to be performed in the first trimester between ten and 15 weeks&#x27; gestation. It is important to note that prenatal genetic testing cannot identify all possible fetal genetic abnormalities or their outcomes. When deciding on whether to perform invasive genetic diagnostic testing such as amniocentesis, patients and their physicians should participate in a shared-decision-making process that takes into account a patient&#x27;s individual risk profile and preferences.

Amniocentesis may be offered to certain patients at higher risk of having a fetus with a genetic disorder. Factors that may place patients at increased risk of fetal genetic disorders include older maternal or paternal age, parental carrier of a balanced chromosomal rearrangement, parental aneuploidy or aneuploidy mosaicism, parental carrier of a genetic disorder, prior child with a structural birth defect, previous fetus or child with autosomal trisomy or sex chromosome aneuploidy, ultrasonographic evidence of a fetus with structural abnormalities, and a high-risk genetic screening test result.

Analysis of samples obtained from amniocentesis is accomplished via karyotyping and DNA analysis technology. Examples of conditions that may be detected include chromosomal abnormalities such as common aneuploidies like trisomy 13, trisomy 18, trisomy 21, Turner syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome. Micro-deletions or micro-duplications, such as DiGeorge syndrome and Cri-du-Chat syndrome, sex-linked disorders, such as hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and specific genetic mutations previously demonstrated to be present in a family or suspected based on fetal ultrasound findings, such as sickle cell disease, Tay–Sachs disease, neurofibromatosis, and cystic fibrosis.

==== Assessment of fetal lung maturity ====
Amniocentesis has traditionally been performed to assess the extent of fetal lung development in the context of medical and obstetrical complications, with the intention of delivering the fetus if fetal lung maturity is demonstrated. Lack of fetal lung maturity increases the risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome.

Fetal lung development can be tested by sampling the amount of surfactant in the amniotic fluid obtained via amniocentesis. Several tests are available, including the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (&quot;L/S ratio&quot;), the presence of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and the surfactant/albumin (S/A) ratio. An L/S ratio of 2.0 is associated with a lower incidence of infant respiratory distress syndrome.

The efficacy of performing amniocentesis for the assessment of fetal lung maturity has been called into question. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine&#x27;s joint statement on the matter states that &quot;if significant maternal or fetal risks exist, delivery should occur regardless of biochemical maturity and if delivery could be deferred owing to absence of pulmonary maturity there is not a stringent indication for prompt delivery.&quot; Based on this rationale, the risks associated with amniocentesis, and the limited indications, performing amniocenteses for assessing fetal lung maturity may become obsolete except in instances where gestational age is unknown.

==== Assessment and management of infection ====
Chorioamnionitis, or intraamniotic infection, is an infection of any combination of the amniotic fluid, placenta, fetus, fetal membranes, or decidua. The gold standard for diagnosing chorioamnionitis is via a gram stain, glucose level, or culture of the amniotic fluid obtained via amniocentesis. However, in clinical practice, performing an amniocentesis for the purpose of diagnosing chorioamnionitis is rare and instead diagnosed based on clinical signs to ensure prompt treatment and avoid invasive prenatal testing.

Amniocentesis can be used to detect other congenital infections such as cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B, parvovirus B19, and toxoplasmosis.

==== Assessment of severity of Rh isoimmunization ====
The Rh factor is an inherited protein found on the surface of red blood cells. If the mother is Rh negative and the father is Rh positive, a fetus has at least a 50% chance of being Rh positive. Rh incompatibility occurs when a mother has Rh-negative blood and her baby has Rh-positive blood. If the red blood cells of an Rh positive fetus cross into their Rh negative mother&#x27;s blood flow, the mother is at risk of Rh sensitization, a process in which maternal antibodies form against red blood cell Rh antigens. Events causing fetomaternal hemorrhage, such as miscarriage, trauma to the abdomen during pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, induced abortion, invasive pregnancy procedures, labor, and birth can lead to fetal Rh positive red blood cells entering the Rh negative maternal circulation. Rh sensitization typically does not cause problems during the first pregnancy of an Rh negative woman. However, in a subsequent pregnancy with an Rh positive fetus, the formed antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the red blood cells of the fetus, a process called Rh isoimmunization that can result in a condition known as Rhesus disease or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.

Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn can lead to varying degrees of fetal anemia, which can potentially have devastating consequences including newborn jaundice, kernicterus, hydrops fetalis, and intrauterine fetal demise. RhD immune globulin (RhoGam) is administered to prevent maternal Rh sensitization in Rh negative patients that are non-sensitized to Rh antigens.

In the past, serial amniocenteses has been used to monitor isoimmunized pregnancies by measuring the levels of bilirubin, a byproduct of red blood cell breakdown, present in amniotic fluid using spectrophotometry. However, ultrasound detecting middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity has now replaced serial amniocenteses for the management of isoimmunized pregnancies.

Amniocentesis is an invasive prenatal test that has the potential to cause maternal and fetal blood cell mixing, which can worsen Rh isoimmunization.

=== Therapeutic indications ===

==== Decompression of polyhydramnios ====
Polyhydramnios is an excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid that can lead to serious perinatal and maternal outcomes such as intrauterine fetal demise, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and cesarean delivery. Physicians have used the process of inserting a needle transabdominally into the uterus to extract excess amniotic fluid, also known as a reductive amniocentesis or decompression, for the management of polyhydramnios as early as the late 1800s.

Reductive amniocentesis is currently indicated for severe cases of polyhydramnios only.

==== Decompression in twin oligohydramnios-polyhydramnios sequence (TOPS) ====
Twin oligohydramnios-polyhydramnios sequence is a rare condition that may occur when twins sharing a single placenta develop significant vascular cross-connections, known as anastomoses, resulting in blood flowing away from one twin to the other. This process can result in polyhydramnios in one twin and oligohydramnios in the other twin. Amniocentesis has been employed to reduce the volume in the sac with polyhydramnios in order to relieve amniotic fluid pressures, a process that may improving fetal circulation and outcomes.

==== Stem cells ====
Amniotic fluid, which is easily collected, cultured, and stored through cryopreservation, can be a rich source of pluripotent and multipotent mesenchymal, hematopoietic, neural, epithelial, and endothelial stem cells. A potential benefit of using amniotic stem cells over those obtained from embryos is that they address the ethical concerns among anti-abortion activists by obtaining pluripotent lines of undifferentiated cells without harm to a fetus or destruction of an embryo. In addition, the use of embryonic cells has been shown to develop into tumors such as teratocarcinomas and frequently acquire chromosomal errors, underscoring the benefits of utilizing amniotic stem cells.

Research has shown that cells from second trimester amniotic fluid are successful at differentiating into various cell lines.

Artificial heart valves, working tracheas, as well as muscle, fat, bone, heart, neural and liver cells have all been engineered through use of amniotic stem cells. Tissues obtained from amniotic cell lines show significant promise for patients with congenital diseases/malformations of the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, and cerebral tissue.

The first amniotic stem cells bank in the US is active in Boston, Massachusetts.

== Contraindications ==
There are no absolute contraindications to amniocentesis. Relative contraindications to the procedure include failure to discontinue anticoagulation therapy 48–72 hours prior to amniocentesis, infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and oligohydramnios. These patients are at a higher risk of complications if they undergo amniocentesis and should be counseled appropriately. In some cases, the advantages of obtaining the results of an amniocentesis may outweigh the increased risk of complications.

Patients on oral anticoagulation therapy have an increased risk of bleeding from the procedure and may be switched to low-molecular-weight heparin, which carries a lower risk for bleeding complications, prior to amniocentesis. There is an increased risk of mother-to-child (vertical) transmission of bloodborne infections in patients with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV after amniocentesis. Patients with high viral loads are at a greater risk of vertical transmission of hepatitis B compared to patients with low viral loads. In patients living with HIV, amniocentesis should be deferred until a combined antiretroviral therapy (CART) regimen is established and the patient achieves a low or undetectable viral load.

While not a contraindication, an amniocentesis may be postponed if fusion of the amnion and chorion has not yet occurred. Performing an amniocentesis prior to the fusion of the amnion and chorion is more likely to lead to procedure failure that may require further sampling attempts.

== Risks and complications ==
Amniocentesis performed for the purpose of prenatal diagnostic testing for genetic disorders has been established as a safe and accurate procedure. The risks and complications associated with amniocentesis include pregnancy loss, preterm labor and delivery, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), fetal injuries, Rhesus disease, and amniotic fluid embolism. Oligohydramnios, fetomaternal hemorrhage, cell culture failure, multiple amniotic fluid extraction attempts, and infections are also possible complications. Additional maternal complications include vaginal bleeding, hematoma of the skin, damage to surrounding internal organs, procedural pain including stinging, pressure, and cramping, and post-procedure discomfort.

A serious risk of amniocentesis is pregnancy loss. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists note that the pregnancy loss rates attributable to amniocentesis are very low. The mechanism for pregnancy loss following amniocentesis is unknown but may be a consequence of bleeding, infection, or trauma to the fetus or the amniotic sac as a result of the procedure. Studies from 2000 to 2006 estimated the procedure-related pregnancy loss at 0.6-0.86%. The most recent systematic review of the literature and updated meta-analysis on the risk of pregnancy loss following amniocentesis was published in 2019. This study cites the amniocentesis-related pregnancy loss to be 0.30% (95% CI, 0.11–0.49%).

The incidence of amniocentesis-related complications, including pregnancy loss and procedure failure, may be mitigated when performed by experienced practitioners who complete 100 or more amniocenteses per year. Experienced practitioners are more likely to complete the procedure with only one puncture attempt. Multiple needle insertion attempts are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy loss. Early amniocentesis, defined as performing the procedure between 10 and 13 weeks&#x27; gestation, is associated with significantly higher rates of pregnancy loss following amniocentesis. Early amniocentesis also has higher rates of other complications, including membrane rupture, clubfoot, and amniotic fluid culture failure. For these reasons, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other similar professional associations recommend against undergoing amniocentesis prior to 14 weeks&#x27; gestation.

In the past, twin pregnancies have been noted to have a higher rate of pregnancy loss (estimated at 3.07%) following amniocentesis. Past literature has shown that twin pregnancies increase the background risk of fetal loss following amniocentesis before 24 weeks&#x27; gestation by 1%. Although data on complications following amniocentesis in twin pregnancies continues to be limited, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists note that rate of pregnancy loss due to amniocentesis in this population is estimated to be around 2%. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis showed similar findings, noting that pregnancy loss following amniocentesis may be lower than previously reported in twin pregnancies. The study also found no significant difference in rates of pregnancy loss between twin pregnancies that underwent amniocentesis and those that did not before 24 weeks of gestation.

Maternal factors that may further increase the risk of pregnancy loss following amniocentesis include:

* Presence of uterine fibroids
* Presence of Müllerian anomalies, which are a group of congenital defects affecting the development of the female reproductive tract 
* Active vaginal infection 
* Maternal body-mass index greater than 40 kg/m2
* Multiparity, or 3 or more childbirths
* History of 3 or more pregnancy losses
* Carrying a fetus with structural malformations
Undergoing amniocentesis in the third trimester has been associated with an increased risk of preterm labor, as defined as the onset of labor between 20 and 37 weeks&#x27; gestation, and preterm delivery. Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and subsequent leakage of amniotic fluid are additional possible complications, with the procedure-related PPROM rate following amniocentesis estimated to be between 1–2%. When compared to cases of spontaneous PPROM, patients with amniocentesis-related PPROM experience better outcomes and lower rates of pregnancy loss. Leakage of amniotic fluid can result in oligohydramnios, or an amniotic fluid volume that is less than the minimum expected for gestational age. Adequate amniotic fluid volumes are essential for fetal lung development. Therefore, possible consequences of oligohydramnios include infant respiratory distress and small, underdeveloped lungs known as fetal lung hypoplasia.

Needle injuries to the fetus are increasingly rare due to the practice of using continuous ultrasound-guidance, including during needle insertion and amniotic fluid extraction. Reported needle injuries include cord bleeding, ocular injuries, fetal brain and cutaneous injuries, and deformities such as clubfoot. The risk of fetal injury increases with increasing number of puncture attempts.

Maternal and fetal blood cells may mix during an amniocentesis and, as a result, patients with rhesus (RhD) negative blood types carrying a RhD positive fetus are at risk of Rh sensitization. Rh sensitization is a process in which maternal antibodies form against red blood cell RhD antigens. In subsequent pregnancies with RhD positive fetuses, maternal presence of these antibodies can attack and destroy fetal red blood cells, a process called Rh isoimmunization that can result in a condition known as Rhesus disease or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Maternal blood type is assessed prior to undergoing amniocentesis and RhD immune globulin (RhoGam) is typically administered within 72 hours of the procedure to prevent maternal Rh sensitization in RhD negative patients that are non-sensitized to RhD antigens.

Amniotic fluid embolism, a condition in which amniotic fluid or other fetal debris enters the maternal circulation, is an extremely rare and catastrophic complication of amniocentesis. Amniotic fluid embolism can result in cardiovascular collapse and has a poor maternal prognosis. However, amniotic fluid embolism following amniocentesis has been reported infrequently in the literature in the last 60 years, mostly in the context of case-reports.

Chorioamnionitis and uterine and maternal skin infections are potential complications of amniocentesis that can occur as a result of bacterial introduction throughout the course of the procedure. The risk of amniocentesis-related chorioamnionitis and uterine infections is less than 0.1%. Performing the procedure using sterile techniques can help prevent infection.

Fetomaternal hemorrhage, or the entrance of fetal blood into the maternal circulation, is another complication of amniocentesis. It can result in anemia that can have consequences of varying severity. The procedure-related risk of fetomaternal hemorrhage attributable to amniocentesis is 2.6%.

Amniotic fluid cell culture after amniocentesis has a failure rate of 0.1%. Later gestational ages at the time of the procedure and amniotic fluid samples contaminated with blood increase the risk of amniocyte culture failure.

While recognizing the aforementioned risks, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that prenatal screening, or diagnostic testing for aneuploidy via procedures like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, be discussed with and offered to all patients regardless of maternal age or risk profile.

==Procedure and technique==
An amniocentesis is typically performed in the second trimester between the 15th and 20th week of gestation; however, it can be done at any later gestational age. It is an outpatient procedure typically performed by an obstetrician-gynecologist with additional amniocentesis training.

Genetic counseling should be provided to the pregnant patient and informed consent should be obtained prior to the procedure.

Prior to the onset of the amniocentesis, the pregnant patient will undergo ultrasound evaluation to assess fetal viability and position, gestational age, amniotic fluid volume, maximum vertical pocket, umbilical cord insertion site, and any obvious fetal deformities. This information is utilized to determine the needle used and how the procedure should be performed. The fetus should be at least 15 weeks&#x27; gestation and the chorion and amnion should be fused.

Amniocentesis is a sterile procedure, therefore medical personnel performing and assisting with the procedure will scrub with antiseptic solution, use sterile gloves, clean the maternal abdomen with antiseptic solution, cover the ultrasound probe with a sterile cover, and use sterile ultrasound gel.

Ultrasound guidance is used continuously throughout the course of the procedure so that the needle is always visualized. A sterile 20–22 gauge spinal needle is firmly inserted perpendicular to the maternal abdomen. After puncturing the maternal abdomen, the operator punctures the uterus, gains access into amniotic cavity by puncturing the amniotic membrane while taking care not to cause membrane tenting, and proceeds to advance the needle into the amniotic cavity. The needle should be guided into the region of the maximum vertical pocket, where the single largest area of amniotic fluid devoid of fetal parts, umbilical cord, and placenta is available for sampling. Amniotic fluid is composed of fetal cells, urine, and lung secretions. 18-20 mL of amniotic fluid is slowly aspirated, with the first 1-2 mL typically discarded due to higher risk of maternal cell contamination. The remaining sample is submitted for laboratory testing. Fetal viability after the procedure should be confirmed by observing adequate fetal cardiac activity. The number of needle puncture attempts should be documented.

There is little scientific data supporting administration of prophylactic antibiotics prior to an amniocentesis and therefore, it is currently not recommended. Similarly, there is little scientific support for the placement of a local anesthetic prior to amniocentesis.

Maternal blood type is assessed prior to undergoing amniocentesis and RhD immune globulin (RhoGam) is typically administered within 72 hours of the procedure to prevent maternal isoimmunization in RhD negative patients that are non-sensitized to RhD antigens.

Amniocentesis technique differs in twin pregnancies and requires additional operator training. The two different approaches are the single-needle technique and two-needle insertion technique.

If used for prenatal genetic diagnosis, fetal cells may be separated by centrifugation from the extracted sample and grown in a culture medium in order to perform genetic tests. The types of tests performed on the sample will be determined by the patient&#x27;s indications for undergoing amniocentesis. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) are two tests commonly performed on uncultured cells after amniocentesis, with results available within two days. These tests can accurately identify trisomy 13, trisomy 18, and trisomy 21. FISH is capable of providing a limited karyotype and, along with the aforementioned trisomies, can also detect aneuploidies in the X and Y sex chromosomes. Abnormal results from FISH studies should be confirmed with other cytogenetic testing, as false positives and negatives are possible Karyotypes are another common test performed on amniotic fluid to visualize chromosome number and characteristics, with a result turnaround of up to three weeks. Another test that may be performed is a chromosomal microarray, which can detect chromosomal imbalances, such as small- and large-scale deletions and duplications. Chromosomal microarray can be performed on cultured or uncultured fetal tissue, with results available as early as 3 days. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist recommends that patients who choose to undergo invasive diagnostic testing have access to chromosomal microarray analysis.

== Recovery ==

After an amniocentesis, patients may resume their routine activity level while withholding from strenuous exercise. Some sources recommend house rest for the initial 24 hours after the procedure, though data supporting this recommendation is limited. Follow-up one week after the procedure is recommended to undergo ultrasound evaluation for fetal viability and assess healing of the puncture site. Post-procedural pain and discomfort should be minimal and temporary and may be managed with acetaminophen. Patients will be instructed to report to an emergency room if they experience vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid, intense uterine pain, or a fever greater than 38 °C.

== History ==
Physicians have used the process of inserting a needle transabdominally into the uterus to extract amniotic fluid for the management of hydramnios, or excess amniotic fluid, as early as the late 1800s. In 1930, needle insertion into the amniotic sac was used to inject contrast dye for the purposes of amniography, or radiographic visualization of the fetal, placental, and uterine outlines. Beginning in the 1950s, amniocentesis was used to diagnose and determine the severity of Rhesus disease. In the mid-1950s, Fritz Fuchs and Povl Riis used fetal cells cultured from extracted amniotic fluid to determine fetal sex based on the presence of Barr Bodies. They postulated that this technique could provide information on the risk for X-linked disease in fetuses with carrier mothers. By the 1960s, this technology was being applied to X-linked conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia. In 1966, M. W Steele and W. R Breg Jr. were able to culture amniocytes that could undergo karyotyping. Their work opened the door to the prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidies. In 1972, R. G. Sutcliffe and D. J. H. Brock found that higher amniotic alpha-fetoprotein levels were associated with neural tube defects.

In 1972, ultrasound-guided amniocenteses began replacing free-handed taps following J. Bang and A. Northeved&#x27;s initiative to employ ultrasound technology to improve amniocentesis. Up until the 1980s, static B-scan ultrasound-guidance was used for the procedure, a process that did not permit visualization of the needle in the amniotic cavity.

Eventually, real-time ultrasound scanners improved the ultrasound-assisted amniocentesis. Given its prenatal diagnostic accuracy for a range of fetal conditions and its relative safety profile, amniocentesis has become the most common invasive fetal testing procedure.

== Society and culture ==

=== Prenatal sex discernment and sex-selective abortion ===

As stated in the history section, amniocentesis can be used to determine the sex of a fetus. This can be medically relevant in families that carry X-linked genetic conditions, since parents may want further genetic testing if the fetus is determined to be male (XY), and therefore has a higher likelihood of having the inherited disease. However, sex discernment is also used for social and cultural reasons. In some cultures, male children are more desirable than female children. This leads some parents to use amniocentesis and other forms of prenatal genetic testing (like chorionic villus sampling and preimplantation genetic diagnosis) to determine the sex of the child with the intent of terminating the pregnancy if the fetus is determined to have two X chromosomes. Sex-selective abortion is particularly common in countries such as China or India, among others. Sex-selective abortion is one of the causes for low child sex ratios in countries in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. There are also significantly skewed child sex ratios in the Caucasus region. Naturally, the human sex ratio is approximately 105 males for every 100 females, and any significant deviations from these values is usually considered evidence for sex selective abortion.

India and China have made prenatal sex determination illegal in an effort to prevent sex-selective abortion. In India, this happened through the 1994 Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition Of Sex Selection) Act (PCPNDT Act). However, this has not necessarily affected the widespread practice of sex-selective abortion as abortion is generally legal, and this law has been inconsistently enforced. In China, the societal preference for male children was exacerbated by the historical one-child policy, where in many regions of China, parents were limited to having only one child. As with India, prenatal sex determination is banned in China but remains a widespread practice, with enforcement also proving to be difficult.

<text>Bengt Jönsson (Oxenstierna), (1390s–1450s) Swedish statesman and noble. 
Under the Kalmar Union, he served as co-regent of Sweden, from January to June 1448, together with his brother Nils Jönsson (Oxenstierna). Member of the Privy Council of Sweden from 1435, and magistrate of Uppland in 1439. Dubbed as knight by King Christopher of Bavaria following his coronation in 1441, and &quot;Master&quot; of the Royal Court from the same year.

His farm was Salsta manor (&quot;Salsta slott&quot;) at Lena parish in Norunda, Uppland. He made large donations to Tensta Church (&quot;Tensta kyrka&quot;) and was featured in a fresco made in 1437 by the artist Johannes Rosenrod.

He married in 1416 with Kristina Kristiernsdotter (Vasa), widow of Karl Stensson Blad, with whom he had four sons including Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna, Archbishop of Uppsala (1448–1467).

<doc id="187700" wikidata="Q1096614" url="?curid=187700" title="Amniotic sac">
<text>The amniotic sac, also called the bag of waters or the membranes, is the sac in which the embryo and later fetus develops in amniotes. It is a thin but tough transparent pair of membranes that hold a developing embryo (and later fetus) until shortly before birth. The inner of these membranes, the amnion, encloses the amniotic cavity, containing the amniotic fluid and the embryo. The outer membrane, the chorion, contains the amnion and is part of the placenta. On the outer side, the amniotic sac is connected to the yolk sac, the allantois, and via the umbilical cord, the placenta.

The yolk sac, amnion, chorion, and allantois are the four extraembryonic membranes that lie outside of the embryo and are involved in providing nutrients and protection to the developing embryo. They form from the inner cell mass; the first to form is the yolk sac followed by the amnion which grows over the developing embryo. The amnion remains an important extraembryonic membrane throughout prenatal development. The third membrane is the allantois, and the fourth is the chorion which surrounds the embryo after about a month and eventually fuses with the amnion.

Amniocentesis is a medical procedure where fluid from the sac is sampled during fetal development, between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, to be used in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections.

==Structure==

The amniotic cavity is the closed sac between the embryo and the amnion, containing the amniotic fluid. The amniotic cavity is formed by the fusion of the parts of the amniotic fold, which first makes its appearance at the cephalic extremity and subsequently at the caudal end and sides of the embryo. As the amniotic fold rises and fuses over the dorsal aspect of the embryo, the amniotic cavity is formed.

===Development===

At the beginning of the second week, a cavity appears within the inner cell mass, and when it enlarges, it becomes the amniotic cavity. The floor of the amniotic cavity is formed by the epiblast. Epiblast migrates between the epiblastic disc and trophoblast. In this way the epiblastic cells migrate between the embryoblast and trophoblast. The floor is formed by the epiblast which later on transforms to ectoderm while the remaining cells which are present between the embryoblast and trophoblast are called amnioblasts (flattened cells). These cells are also derived from epiblast which is transformed into ectoderm.

The amniotic cavity is surrounded by an extraembryonic membrane, called the amnion. As the implantation of the blastocyst progresses, a small space appears in the embryoblast, which is the primordium of the amniotic cavity. Soon, amniogenic (amnion-forming cells) called amnioblasts separate from the epiblast and line the amnion, which encloses the amniotic cavity.

The epiblast forms the floor of the amniotic cavity and is continuous peripherally with the amnion. The hypoblast forms the roof of the exocoelomic cavity and is continuous with the thin exocoelomic membrane. This membrane along with hypoblast forms the primary yolk sac. The embryonic disc now lies between the amniotic cavity and the primary yolk sac. Cells from the yolk sac endoderm form a layer of connective tissue, the extraembryonic mesoderm, which surrounds the amnion and yolk sac.

===Birth===
If, after birth, the complete amniotic sac or big parts of the membrane remain coating the newborn, this is called a caul.

When seen in the light, the amniotic sac is shiny and very smooth, but tough.

Once the baby is pushed out of the mother&#x27;s uterus, the umbilical cord, placenta, and amniotic sac are pushed out in the afterbirth.

==Function==
The amniotic sac and its filling provide a liquid that surrounds and cushions the fetus. It is a site of exchange of essential substances, such as oxygen, between the umbilical cord and the fetus. It allows the fetus to move freely within the walls of the uterus. Buoyancy is also provided.

==Clinical significance==
Chorioamnionitis is inflammation of the amniotic sac (&quot;&quot; + &quot;amnion&quot; + &quot;&quot;), usually because of infection. It is a risk factor for neonatal sepsis.

During labor, the amniotic sac must break so that the child can be born. This is known as rupture of membranes (ROM). Normally, it occurs spontaneously at full term either during or at the beginning of labor. A premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a rupture of the amnion that occurs prior to the onset of labor. An artificial rupture of membranes (AROM), also known as an amniotomy, may be clinically performed using an amnihook or amnicot in order to induce or to accelerate labour.

The amniotic sac has to be punctured to perform amniocentesis. This is fairly routine procedure, but can lead to infection of the amniotic sac in a very small number of cases. Infection more commonly arises vaginally.

<doc id="187701" wikidata="Q473749" url="?curid=187701" title="Amnion">
<text>The amnion (: amnions or amnia) is a membrane that closely covers human and various other embryos when they first form. It fills with amniotic fluid, which causes the amnion to expand and become the amniotic sac that provides a protective environment for the developing embryo. The amnion, along with the chorion, the yolk sac and the allantois protect the embryo. In birds, reptiles and monotremes, the protective sac is enclosed in a shell. In marsupials and placental mammals, it is enclosed in a uterus.

The amnion is a feature of the vertebrate clade &quot;Amniota&quot;, which includes reptiles, birds, and mammals. Amphibians and fish lack the amnion and thus are anamniotes (non-amniotes). The amnion stems from the extra-embryonic somatic mesoderm on the outer side and the extra-embryonic ectoderm or trophoblast on the inner side.

== Etymology ==
Etymologists have traditionally assumed that the Greek term ἀμνίον (&quot;amnion&quot;) relates to Ancient Greek ἀμνίον : , &quot;little lamb&quot;, a diminutive of ἀμνός : , &quot;lamb&quot;, and cognate with the English verb &quot;&quot;, &quot;to bring forth young (usually lambs)&quot;. However, an alternative etymology references an ancient Greek goddess of childbirth, Eileithyia, worshipped in Amnisos (on the island of Crete) and nicknamed Ἀμνιάς (Amnias).

==In humans==
In the human embryo, the earliest stages of the formation of the amnion have not been observed; in the youngest embryo that has been studied the amnion was already present as a closed sac, and appears in the inner cell-mass as a cavity. This cavity is roofed in by a single stratum of flattened, ectodermal cells, the amniotic ectoderm, and its floor consists of the prismatic ectoderm of the embryonic disk. Outside the amniotic ectoderm is a thin layer of mesoderm, which is continuous with that of the somatopleure and is connected by the body-stalk with the mesodermal lining of the chorion.

When first formed, the amnion is in contact with the body of the embryo, but about the fourth or fifth week amniotic fluid (also called &quot;liquor amnii&quot;) begins to accumulate within it. This fluid increases in quantity and causes the amnion to expand and ultimately to adhere to the chorion&#x27;s inner surface, so that the extra-embryonic part of the coelom is obliterated. The amniotic fluid increases in quantity up to the sixth or seventh month of pregnancy, after which it diminishes somewhat; at the end of pregnancy it amounts to about one liter.

The amniotic fluid allows the free movements of the fetus during the later stages of pregnancy, and also protects it by diminishing the risk of injury from without. It contains less than two percent solids, consisting of urea and other extractives, inorganic salts, a small amount of protein, and frequently a trace of sugar. That some of the liquor amnii is swallowed by the fetus is proved by the fact that epidermal debris and hairs have been found among the contents of the fetal alimentary canal.

==Clinical significance==
Extra-amniotic pregnancy is a rare condition that results from a rupture of the amnion, leading to development of the fetus within the extraembryonic coelom.

==Other animals==
In reptiles, birds, and many mammals the amnion develops in the following manner:

At the point of constriction where the primitive digestive tube of the embryo joins the yolk sac a reflection or folding upward of the somatopleure takes place.

This, the amniotic fold, first makes its appearance at the cephalic extremity, and subsequently at the caudal end and sides of the embryo, and gradually rising, its different parts meet and fuse over the dorsal aspect of the embryo, and enclose a cavity, the amniotic cavity. This kind of amnion is known as pleuroamnion (formed by folding), as opposed to schyzoamnion (formed by delamination).

After the fusion of the edges of the amniotic fold, the two layers of the fold become completely separated, the inner forming the amnion, the outer the false amnion or serosa.

The space between the amnion and the serosa constitutes the extra-embryonic celom, and for a time communicates with the embryonic celom.

Cats and dogs are born inside of the amnion; the mother cuts it open and eats it.

In elephants, &quot;The amnion is continued from the base of the umbilical cord upon the allantois, which is of considerable size, and is so interposed between the chorion and amnios, as to prevent any part of the amnios attaining the inner surface of the placenta. The amnios consists of two layers:one is the granular layer, continued upon the inner or foetal surface of the allantois, and thence upon the umbilical cord; the other is the smooth outer layer, continued upon the outer or chorional surface of the allantois, and thence upon the inner surface of the chorion.&quot;

== Application ==
The amniotic membrane is used as a biological dressing to heal incurable wounds. For this purpose, the placenta in cesarean delivery is collected and under aseptic conditions, the amniotic membrane is separated and packaged and sold commercially. In valid commercial products to prevent transmission of viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis, the donor&#x27;s blood (mother) is tested. Products usually pass the sterility and endotoxin test in accordance with the rules of the Food and Drug Administration of the country of manufacture.

<doc id="187707" wikidata="Q310433" url="?curid=187707" title="Karl Knutsson">
<text>Karl Knutsson Bonde ( 1408–1470), also known as Charles VIII and called Charles I in Norwegian contexts, was King of Sweden (1448–1457, 1464–1465 and 1467–1470) and King of Norway (1449–1450).

==Early life==
Karl Knutsson Bonde was born in October 1408 or 1409, at Ekholmen Castle, the son of Knut Tordsson (Bonde), knight and member of the privy council (&quot;riksråd&quot;), and Margareta Karlsdotter (Sparre av Tofta), the only daughter and heiress of Karl Ulfsson, Lord of Tofta. His father Knut was first cousin of Erik Johansson Vasa&#x27;s father. His first marriage, in 1428, to Birgitta Turesdotter (Bielke) (died 1436) gave him his daughter Christina. His second marriage, in 1438, to Catherine (Gumsehuvud, died in 1450) produced his second daughter Magdalena, who married Ivar Axelsson (Tott). He also had two children by his third wife (and former mistress) Christina Abrahamsdotter, Anna and Karl. His father was said by contemporary legends to descend from a younger brother of King Erik the Holy. His mother, an important heiress, descended from Jarl Karl the Deaf and consequently from some ancient Folkunge earls of Sweden, as well as from Ingegerd Knutsdotter, a daughter of Canute IV of Denmark and Adela of Flanders.

==Growing influence==
In 1434, Karl became a member of the Privy Council of Sweden and in October of the same year he assumed one of its most senior offices, Lord High Constable of Sweden, or &quot;Riksmarsk&quot;. Because of the growing dissatisfaction with King Eric of Pomerania among the Swedish nobility, Karl was in 1436 made &quot;Rikshövitsman&quot;, an office equating to Military Governor of the Realm, and finally replaced the king as an elected regent from 1438 to 1440, as the result of the rebellion by Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson. During Karl&#x27;s brief regentship, the so-called Rebellion of David (a peasant rebellion) took place in Finland. Eric of Pomerania was forced to step down from the throne and in 1440 Christopher of Bavaria, was elected king of Sweden, Norway and Denmark. At the coronation of Christopher in September 1441, Karl was dubbed a knight and appointed Lord High Justiciar of Sweden, or &quot;Riksdrots&quot;. In October he resigned as Lord High Justiciar and resumed his office as Lord High Constable. From 1442, he was the military governor, &quot;hövitsman&quot;, at Viborg in Finland (Fief of Viborg).

Karl acquired extensive fiefs, for example in Western Finland. His first seat was in Turku. Soon, Christopher&#x27;s government began to take back fiefs and positions and he was forced to give up the castle of Turku. Karl&#x27;s next seat was the castle of Viborg, on Finland&#x27;s eastern border, where he kept an independent court, taking no heed of Christopher and exercising his own foreign policy in relation to such powers in the region as the Hanseatic League, the Russian city of Novgorod and the Teutonic Knights in what are today Estonia and Latvia.

==King of Sweden and Norway==
At the death of Christopher in 1448, without a direct heir, Karl was elected king of Sweden on 20 June, and on 28 June, he was hailed as the new monarch at the Stones of Mora, not far from Uppsala, mostly due to his own military troops being present at the place, against the wishes of regents Bengt and Nils Jönsson (Oxenstierna). The Danish had in September 1448 elected Christian I as their new monarch. A rivalry ensued between Karl and Christian for the throne of Norway, which had also been ruled by Christopher, with both kings gaining support from various factions in the Norwegian Council of the realm. In 1449, a portion of the Norwegian council elected Karl as king of Norway, and he was crowned in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 20 November. However, Christian also continued pursuing his claim to Norway. The Swedish aristocracy was reluctant to back Karl in a war against Denmark over Norway, and already in June 1450, he was forced to relinquish the throne of Norway in favour of Christian.

From 1451, Sweden and Denmark were in state of war against each other. Because of devastating warring, a growing opposition against Karl emerged among the nobility in Sweden. The strongest opponent was the Swedish church which opposed his efforts to concentrate royal and secular power. Other opponents were the family group of Oxenstierna and the House of Vasa, which had been on the opposing side in the election of king and lost.

==Later reigns==
During the next 20 years, Karl was deposed twice, only to regain the throne and reign three times (1448–1457, 1464–65, 1467–1470).

In 1457, a rebellion took place, led by Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna) and a nobleman, Erik Axelsson Tott. Karl went into exile to Danzig (Gdańsk). The two leaders of the revolt took the regentship, and organized the election of Christian I of Denmark as king (firstly in Turku, then in Stockholm).

In 1463, King Christian quarrelled with the Archbishop because of his taxation policies. The Archbishop was imprisoned, which resulted in a rebellion by his relatives, and led to Christian being driven out of Sweden. Karl was recalled by the rebels and returned at the head of a force of German and Polish mercenaries. Upon arrival in Sweden, he found himself at war with the Archbishop, and after a new rebellion in the winter of 1464–1465, he was again exiled. In 1467, the regent Erik Axelsson Tott, now having reverted to support Karl Knutsson, once more had him crowned. He then reigned for three years, sharing power with the Riksråd, until his death in Stockholm in May 1470.

==Family==

With his wife Birgitta Turesdotter (Bielke), Karl had:
* Ture Karlsson (Bonde) (died young before 1447)
* Christina Karlsdotter (Bonde) (c. 1432 – before 1500), married 1446 to the noble, councillor, and courtier Erik Eriksson (Gyllenstierna)

With his wife Catherine, he had:
* Margaret Karlsdotter (Bonde) (1442–1462)
* Magdalena of Sweden (1445–1495), married to noble Ivar Axelsson (Tott) in 1466
* Richeza Karlsdotter (Bonde) (born c. 1445), nun at Vadstena Abbey
* Bridget Karlsdotter (Bonde) (1446–1469), nun at Vadstena Abbey
* four sons died early

With his mistress Christina Abrahamsdotter, he had:
* Anna Karlsdotter (Bonde), married to the noble Håkan Svensson (Bölja), governor of Västerås castle.
* Karl Karlsson (Bonde) (1465–1488)

Karl was survived by only one son, born of Christina Abrahamsdotter, whom he married on his deathbed. Though she was recognized as queen, the Swedish government did not allow the suddenly legitimized boy to succeed him, but appointed one of their number, Sten Sture the Elder (who was Karl&#x27;s nephew), as regent.

==Regnal name==
Karl Knutsson was the second Swedish king by the name of Karl (sometimes anglicized as &quot;Charles&quot;). &quot;Charles VIII&quot; is a posthumous invention, counting backwards from Charles IX (r. 1604–1611) who adopted his numeral according to a fictitious history of Sweden. Six others before Charles VII are unknown to any sources before Johannes Magnus&#x27;s 16th century book &quot;&quot;, and are considered his invention. Karl Knutsson was the first Swedish monarch of the name to actually use a regnal number as &quot;Karl II&quot; (later retrospectively renumbered VIII), on his wife&#x27;s tombstone (1451) at Vadstena.

==Legacy==
Karl represented a growing nationalist tendency among the Swedish aristocracy which tried first to subjugate the other Scandinavian countries under Sweden but soon focused on dissolving the Kalmar Union. In the next century, when the union was finally dissolved, he received some respect as an early champion of Swedish independence.

Karl&#x27;s fight for power and kingship was more successful than his experience thereof. He allegedly recognized this himself and described his life in a brief poem:

&quot;When I was Lord of Fågelvik,&quot; (pronounced: &quot;foegle-veek&quot;)
&quot;Then I had wealth and might unique.&quot;
&quot;But once I was King of the Swedish land,&quot;
&quot;I was a poor and unhappy man.&quot;

Karl&#x27;s great-granddaughter Christina Nilsdotter Gyllenstierna was married to Sten Sture the Younger whose regentship represented similar values: nationalism and Swedish independence.

Though the Bonde family, not descendants of Karl Knutsson himself but just his collateral relatives, remained prominent among the Swedish nobility and in politics into the 20th Century, Karl&#x27;s own descendants did not ascend nor inherit any thrones until Prince Christian zu Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg became Christian IX of Denmark in 1863. Karl&#x27;s descendants have since ascended the thrones of Norway, Greece and Great Britain, Brunswick, Luxembourg, Belgium, Spain, Romania and Russia Empire together with Grand Duchy of Finland. Nicholas II was the first direct descendant on the Finnish throne.

His distant direct descendant, Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, married the Hereditary Prince of Sweden in the 20th century, and with the accession of Sibylla&#x27;s son, Carl XVI Gustav, Karl Knutsson&#x27;s blood returned to the Swedish throne.

<doc id="187709" wikidata="Q3631723" url="?curid=187709" title="BBC Television Shakespeare">
<text>The BBC Television Shakespeare is a series of British television adaptations of the plays of William Shakespeare, created by Cedric Messina and broadcast by BBC Television. Transmitted in the UK from 3 December 1978 to 27 April 1985, the series spanned seven seasons and thirty-seven episodes.

Development began in 1975 when Messina saw that the grounds of Glamis Castle would make a perfect location for an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot; for the &quot;Play of the Month&quot; series. Upon returning to London, however, he had come to envision an entire series devoted exclusively to the dramatic works of Shakespeare. When he encountered a less than enthusiastic response from the BBC&#x27;s departmental heads, Messina bypassed the usual channels and took his idea directly to the top of the BBC hierarchy, who greenlighted the show. Experiencing financial, logistical and creative problems in the early days of production, Messina persevered and served as executive producer for two years. When he was replaced by Jonathan Miller at the start of season three, the show experienced something of a creative renaissance as strictures on the directors&#x27; interpretations of the plays were loosened, a policy continued under Shaun Sutton, who took over as executive producer for seasons five, six and seven. By the end of its run, the series had proved both a ratings and a financial success.

Initially, the adaptations received generally negative reviews, although the reception improved somewhat as the series went on, and directors were allowed more freedom, leading to interpretations becoming more daring. Several episodes are now held in high esteem, particularly some of the traditionally lesser-known and less frequently staged plays. The complete set is a popular collection, and several episodes represent the only non-theatrical production of the particular play currently available on DVD. From 26 May 2020, all 37 plays became available to stream in North America via BritBox.

==Introduction==

===Origins===
The concept for the series originated in 1975 with Cedric Messina, a BBC producer who specialised in television productions of theatrical classics, while he was on location at Glamis Castle in Angus, Scotland, shooting an adaptation of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;The Little Minister&quot; for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Month&quot; series. During his time on set, Messina realised that the castle grounds would make a perfect location for an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;. By the time he had returned to London, however, his idea had grown considerably, and he now envisioned an entire series devoted exclusively to the dramatic work of Shakespeare; a series which would adapt all thirty-seven Shakespearean plays.

Almost immediately upon pitching the idea to his colleagues, however, Messina began to encounter problems. He had anticipated that everyone in the BBC would be excited about the concept, but this did not prove so. In particular, the Drama/Plays division felt the series could not possibly be a financial success without international sales, which they did not see as likely. Furthermore, they argued that Shakespeare on television rarely worked, and they thought that there was simply no need to do all thirty-seven plays, as many were obscure and would not find an audience amongst the general public, even in the UK. Disappointed with their lack of enthusiasm, Messina went over the departmental heads, forwarding his proposal directly to Director of Programmes Alasdair Milne and Director-General Ian Trethowan, both of whom liked the idea. Although there were still reservations within the BBC, and Messina&#x27;s decision to bypass the accepted hierarchy would not be forgotten, with the support of Milne and Trethowan, the series was greenlighted, with its daunting scope championed as part of its appeal; &quot;it was a grand project, no one else could do it, no one else would do it, but it ought to be done.&quot; Writing several months into production, journalist Henry Fenwick wrote the project was &quot;gloriously British, gloriously BBC.&quot;

===Shakespeare on the BBC===
The BBC had screened many Shakespearean adaptations before, and by 1978, the only plays which they had not shown in specifically made-for-TV adaptations were &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, &quot;Pericles&quot;, &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; and &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. However, despite this level of experience, they had never produced anything on the scale of the &quot;Shakespeare Series&quot;. Exclusively made-for-television Shakespearean productions had commenced on 5 February 1937 with the live broadcast of Act 3, Scene 2 from &quot;As You Like It&quot;, directed by Robert Atkins, and starring Margaretta Scott as Rosalind and Ion Swinley as Orlando. Later that evening, the wooing scene from &quot;Henry V&quot; was broadcast, directed by George More O&#x27;Ferrall, and starring Henry Oscar as Henry and Yvonne Arnaud as Katherine. O&#x27;Ferrall would oversee numerous broadcasts of Shakespearean extracts over the course of 1937, including Mark Antony&#x27;s funeral speech from &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, with Henry Oscar as Antony (11 February), several scenes between Benedick and Beatrice from &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, featuring Henry Oscar and Margaretta Scott (also 11 February), several scenes between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth from &quot;Macbeth&quot;, starring Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson (25 March), and a heavily truncated version of &quot;Othello&quot;, starring Baliol Holloway as Othello, Celia Johnson as Desdemona and D.A. Clarke-Smith as Iago (14 December).

Other 1937 productions included two different screenings of scenes from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;; one directed by Dallas Bower, starring Patricia Hilliard as Titania and Hay Petrie as Nick Bottom (18 February), the other an extract from Stephen Thomas&#x27; Regent&#x27;s Park production, starring Alexander Knox as Oberon and Thea Holme as Titania, aired as part of the celebrations for Shakespeare&#x27;s birthday (23 April). 1937 also saw the broadcast of the wooing scene from &quot;Richard III&quot;, directed by Stephen Thomas, and starring Ernest Milton as Richard and Beatrix Lehmann as Lady Anne (9 April). In 1938, the first full-length broadcast of a Shakespearean play took place; Dallas Bower&#x27;s modern dress production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, starring D.A. Clark-Smith as Mark Antony and Ernest Milton as Caesar (24 July). The following year saw the first feature length made-for-TV production; &quot;The Tempest&quot;, also directed by Bower, and starring John Abbott as Prospero and Peggy Ashcroft as Miranda (5 February). The vast majority of these transmissions were broadcast live, and they came to an end with the onset of war in 1939. None of them survive now.

After the war, Shakespearean adaptations were screened much less frequently and tended to be more &#x27;significant&#x27; specifically made-for-TV productions. In 1947, for example, O&#x27;Ferrall directed a two-part adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, starring John Byron as Hamlet, Sebastian Shaw as Claudius and Margaret Rawlings as Gertrude (5 &amp; 15 December). Other post war productions included &quot;Richard II&quot;, directed by Royston Morley, and starring Alan Wheatley as Richard and Clement McCallin as Bolingbroke (29 October 1950); &quot;Henry V&quot;, again directed by Morley, and starring Clement McCallin as Henry and Olaf Pooley as The Dauphin (22 April 1951); an original &quot;Sunday Night Theatre&quot; production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, directed by Desmond Davis, and starring Margaret Johnston as Katherina and Stanley Baker as Petruchio (20 April 1952); a TV version of John Barton&#x27;s Elizabethan Theatre Company production of &quot;Henry V&quot;, starring Colin George as Henry and Michael David as The Dauphin (19 May 1953); a &quot;Sunday Night Theatre&quot; live performance of Lionel Harris&#x27; musical production of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;, starring David Pool as Antipholus of Ephesus and Paul Hansard as Antipholus of Syracuse (16 May 1954); and &quot;The Life of Henry the Fifth&quot;, the inaugural programme of BBC&#x27;s new &quot;World Theatre&quot; series, directed by Peter Dews, and starring John Neville as Henry and John Wood as The Dauphin (29 December 1957).

There were also four multi-part made-for-TV Shakespearean adaptations shown during the 1950s and 1960s; three specifically conceived as TV productions, one a TV adaptation of a stage production. The first was &quot;The Life and Death of Sir John Falstaff&quot; (1959). Produced and directed by Ronald Eyre, and starring Roger Livesey as Falstaff, the series took all of the Falstaff scenes from the &quot;Henriad&quot; and adapted them into seven thirty-minute episodes. The second was &quot;An Age of Kings&quot; (1960). Produced by Peter Dews and directed by Michael Hayes, the show comprised fifteen episodes between sixty and eighty minutes each, which adapted all eight of Shakespeare&#x27;s sequential history plays (&quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;, &quot;2 Henry IV&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;). The third was &quot;The Spread of the Eagle&quot; (1963), directed and produced by Dews. Featuring nine sixty-minute episodes, the series adapted the Roman plays, in chronological order of the real-life events depicted; &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. The fourth series was not an original TV production, but a made-for-TV &quot;reimagining&quot; of a stage production; &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;, which was screened in both 1965 and 1966. &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; was a three-part adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s first historical tetralogy (&quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;) which had been staged to great critical and commercial success at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1963, adapted by John Barton, and directed by Barton and Peter Hall. At the end of its run, the production was remounted for TV, shot on the actual Royal Shakespeare Theatre stage, using the same set as the theatrical production, but not during live performances. Directed for television by Michael Hayes and Robin Midgley, it originally aired in 1965 as a three-parter, just as the plays had been staged (the three parts were called &quot;Henry VI&quot;, &quot;Edward IV&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;). Due to the popularity of the 1965 broadcast, the series was again screened in 1966, but the three plays were divided up into ten episodes of fifty minutes each.

Although &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;, which was the most expensive and ambitious Shakespearean production up to that point, was a critical and commercial success, &quot;The Spread of the Eagle&quot; was not, and afterwards, the BBC decided to return to smaller-scale productions with less financial risk. In 1964, for example, they screened a live performance of Clifford Williams&#x27; Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) production of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; from the Aldwych Theatre, starring Ian Richardson as Antipholus of Ephesus and Alec McCowen as Antipholus of Syracuse. 1964 also saw the broadcast of &quot;Hamlet at Elsinore&quot;, directed by Philip Saville and produced by Peter Luke. Starring Christopher Plummer as Hamlet, Robert Shaw as Claudius and June Tobin as Gertrude, the entire play was shot on-location in Helsingør at the real Elsinore Castle. In 1970, they screened &quot;The Tragedy of Richard II&quot;, sourced from Richard Cottrell&#x27;s touring production, and starring Ian McKellen as Richard and Timothy West as Bolingbroke.

Additionally, the &quot;Play of the Month&quot; series had screened several Shakespearean adaptations over the years; &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1967), &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1968), &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1969), &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1970), &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1971), &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1972), &quot;King Lear&quot; (1975) and &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; (1975).

===Funding===
The &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; project was the most ambitious engagement with Shakespeare ever undertaken by either a television or film production company. So large was the project that the BBC could not finance it alone, requiring a North American partner who could guarantee access to the United States market, deemed essential for the series to recoup its costs. In their efforts to source this funding, the BBC met with some initial good luck. Cedric Messina&#x27;s script editor, Alan Shallcross, was the cousin of Denham Challender, executive officer of the New York branch of Morgan Guaranty Trust. Challender knew that Morgan were looking to underwrite a public arts endeavour, and he suggested the Shakespeare series to his superiors. Morgan contacted the BBC, and a deal was quickly reached. However, Morgan was only willing to invest about one-third of what was needed (approximately £1.5 million/$3.6 million). Securing the rest of the necessary funding took the BBC considerably longer – almost three years.

Exxon were the next to invest, offering another third of the budget in 1976. The following year, Time Life, the BBC&#x27;s US distributor, was contacted by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) about possible investment in the project. However, because CPB used public funding, its interest in the series caught the attention of US labour unions and theatre professionals, who objected to the idea of US money subsidising British programming. The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) began to put pressure on CPB not to invest in the series. Joseph Papp, director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, was particularly aghast, arguing that US television could do the entire canon for TV just as easily as the BBC, and publicly urging CPB not to invest. Before the situation came to a head, however, the necessary third investor was found, Metropolitan Life. Their investment meant that with the $5.5 million invested by the BBC, plus the money from Morgan and Exxon, the project was fully funded.

The complexity of this funding is indicated by the general opening credits for the US screening of each episode; &quot;The series is made possible by grants from Exxon, Metropolitan Life, and Morgan Bank. It is a BBC-TV and Time/Life television co-production, presented for the Public Broadcasting Service by WNET/Thirteen, New York.&quot; According to Jac Venza, executive producer at WNET, &quot;it was one of the few times that we got three separate corporate funders to agree to funding something six years into the future. That was in itself a kind of extraordinary feat.&quot;

===Rejected plans===
One of Messina&#x27;s earliest decisions regarding the series was to hire a literary advisor; Professor John Wilders of Worcester College, Oxford. Wilders initially wanted the shows to work from completely new texts re-edited from the various quartos, octavos and folios specifically for the productions, but when the time necessary for this proved impractical, Wilders decided instead to use Peter Alexander&#x27;s 1951 edition of the &quot;Complete Works&quot; as the series &quot;bible.&quot;

At first, Messina envisioned the series as having six seasons of six episodes each, the plan being to adapt the three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays into a two-part episode. This idea was quickly rejected, however, as it was felt to be an unacceptable compromise and it was instead decided to simply have one season with seven episodes. Initially, Messina toyed with the idea of shooting the plays in the chronological order of their composition, but this plan was abandoned because it was felt that doing so would necessitate the series beginning with a run of relatively little known plays, not to mention the fact that there is no definitive chronology. Instead, Messina, Wilders and Shallcross decided that the first season would comprise some of the better-known comedies (&quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot;) and tragedies (&quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;). &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; was selected as the season&#x27;s &quot;obscure&quot; play, and &quot;King Richard the Second&quot; was included to begin the eight-part sequence of history plays. When the production of the inaugural episode, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, was abandoned after it had been shot, it was replaced by &quot;The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eight&quot; as the sixth episode of the season.

Almost immediately, however, the concept for the historical octology ran into trouble. Messina had wanted to shoot the eight sequential history plays in chronological order of the events they depicted, with linked casting and the same director for all eight adaptations (David Giles), with the sequence spread out over the entire six-season run. During the early planning stages for &quot;King Richard the Second&quot; and &quot;The First Part of King Henry the Fourth,&quot; however, the plan for linked casting fell apart, when it was discovered that although Jon Finch (Henry Bolingbroke in &quot;Richard&quot;) could return as Henry IV, Jeremy Bulloch as Hotspur and David Swift as the Earl of Northumberland were unable to do so, and the parts would have to be recast, thus undermining the concept of shooting the plays as one sequence. Ultimately, during the first season, &quot;King Richard the Second&quot;, although still directed by Giles, was treated as a stand-alone piece, while &quot;The First Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot;, &quot;The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot; and &quot;The Life of Henry the Fift&quot; (all also directed by Giles) were treated as a trilogy during the second season, with linked casting between them. Additionally, in an attempt to establish a connection with the first season&#x27;s &quot;Richard&quot;, Jon Finch returned as Henry IV, and &quot;The First Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot; opened with the murder of Richard from the previous play. The second set of four plays were then directed by Jane Howell as one unit, with a common set and linked casting, airing during the fifth season.
Another early idea, which never came to fruition, was the concept of forming a single repertory acting company to perform all thirty-seven plays. The RSC, however, were not especially pleased with this idea, as it saw itself as the national repertory. Before the plan could be put into practice, the British Actors&#x27; Equity Association blocked the proposal, arguing that as many of its members as possible should get the chance to appear in the series. They also wrote into their contract with the BBC that only British and Irish actors could be cast. During the planning for season two, when it came to their attention that Messina was trying to cast James Earl Jones as Othello, Equity threatened to have their members strike, thus crippling the series. This forced Messina to abandon the casting of Jones, and &quot;Othello&quot; was pushed back to a later season.

===Realism===
Messina&#x27;s initial aesthetic concept for the series was realism, especially in terms of the sets, which were to be as naturally representational as possible. This was based upon what Messina knew of TV audiences and their expectations. His opinion, supported by many of his staff, was that the majority of the audience would not be regular theatregoers who would respond to stylisation or innovation. Speaking of the &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; set, Henry Fenwick notes that

Indeed, two of the first-season episodes &quot;were&quot; recorded on location; &quot;As You Like It&quot; in and around Glamis Castle, and &quot;The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eight&quot; in three different castles in Kent.

However, despite the insistence on realism, both of the initial episodes, &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; and &quot;King Richard the Second&quot;, featured obviously fake, newly constructed studio-bound sets which were much criticised by reviewers for failing to achieve any sense of lived-in reality; &quot;such half-realism repeatedly belies the very verisimilitude that was its goal.&quot; The scathing reviews of the early sets led to the series adopting an even more realistic approach in future adaptations, especially in productions such as &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, all of which feature &quot;a credible studio verisimilitude of exteriors, of places that work like filming on location rather than in a somewhat realistic stage or studio set.&quot; However, not everyone was a fan of the more extreme realistic aesthetic. John Wilders, for example, preferred the &quot;fake realism&quot; of the first plays, which he felt were &quot;much more satisfactory than location work because the deliberate artificiality of the scenery works in harmony with the conventions of the plays. Unfortunately, it may create the impression that we have tried to build realistic sets but have failed for want of skill or money.&quot; This is exactly the impression it had created and was why later episodes featured far more elaborate sets, and why realism had been jettisoned as the over-riding stylistic approach by the time of &quot;Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot; at the end of the second season. When Jonathan Miller took over as producer at the start of season three, realism ceased to be a priority.

===UK publicity===
Prior to the screening of the first episode, UK publicity for the series was extensive, with virtually every department at the BBC involved. Once the series had begun, a major aspect of the publicity campaign involved previews of each episode for the press prior to its public broadcast, so reviews could appear before the episode aired; the idea being that good reviews might get people to watch who otherwise would not. Other publicity &#x27;events&#x27; included a party to celebrate the commencement of the third season, at The George Inn, Southwark, near the site of the Globe Theatre, and a similar party at the start of the sixth season, in Glamis Castle, which was attended by Ian Hogg, Alan Howard, Joss Ackland, Tyler Butterworth, Wendy Hiller, Patrick Ryecart and Cyril Cusack, all of whom were on hand for interviews by the many invited journalists.

Another major aspect of the promotional work was supplementary educational material. For example, the BBC had their books division issue the scripts for each episode, prepared by script editor Alan Shallcross (seasons 1 and 2) and David Snodin (seasons 3 and 4) and edited by John Wilders. Each publication included a general introduction by Wilders, an essay on the production itself by Henry Fenwick, interviews with the cast and crew, photographs, a glossary, and annotations on textual alterations by Shallcross, and subsequently Snodin, with explanations as to why certain cuts had been made.

As well as the published annotated scripts, the BBC also produced two complementary shows designed to help viewers engage with the plays on a more scholarly level; the radio series &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; and the TV series &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot;. &quot;Prefaces&quot; was a series of thirty-minute shows focused on the performance history of each play, with commentary provided by an actor who had performed the play in the past. The actor would discuss the general stage history, as well as their own experiences working on the play, with each episode airing on BBC Radio 4 one to three nights prior to the screening of the actual episode on BBC 2.

The TV supplement, &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot;, was a more generally educational show, with each twenty-five-minute episode dealing with various aspects of the production, hosted by various well-known figures, who, generally speaking, were not involved in Shakespeare &quot;per se&quot;. Aired on BBC 2 the night before the transmission of the show itself, the main intention of the series was &quot;to enlighten a new audience for Shakespeare on television, attract people to the plays and give them some background material. [The presenters] encapsulated the stories of the plays, provided an historical framework, where feasible, and offer some original thoughts which might intrigue those already familiar with the text.&quot; The level of scholarship was purposely gauged for O and A-level exams, with presenters writing their own scripts. However, the series often ran into trouble. For the show on &quot;Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot;, for example, when the crew turned up to shoot, the presenter stated simply, &quot;This is one of the silliest plays ever written, and I have nothing to say about it.&quot; This prompted a hastily organised program hosted by Clive James.

The biggest problem with &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot;, however, and the one most frequently commented upon in reviews, was that the presenter of each episode had not seen the production about which he/she was speaking, and often, there was a disparity between their remarks and the interpretation offered by the show. For example, poet Stephen Spender&#x27;s comments about &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; being a play of great beauty which celebrates the cycles of nature seemed at odds with Jane Howell&#x27;s semi-stylised single-set production, where a lone tree was used to represent the change in seasons. The most commented upon example of this disparity was in relation to &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, which was hosted by playwright and screenwriter Dennis Potter. In his review for &quot;The Observer&quot; of both the production and the &quot;Perspective&quot; show, Julian Barnes wrote &quot;several furlongs understandably separate the left hand of the BBC from the right one. Only rarely, though, do we witness such a cameo of intermanual incomprehension as occurred last week within their Shakespeare cycle: the right hand seizing a hammer and snappishly nailing the left hand to the arm of the chair.&quot; Barnes points out that clearly, Potter had not seen the show when recording his commentary. He was correct; Potter&#x27;s &quot;Perspective&quot; had been recorded before &quot;Cymbeline&quot; had even been shot. According to Barnes,

===US publicity===

In the US, the BBC hired Stone/Hallinan Associates to handle publicity. However, because the show aired on public television, many US newspapers and magazines would not cover it. To launch the show in the US, a reception was held at the White House, attended by Rosalynn Carter, followed by lunch at the Folger Shakespeare Library. The main representative was Anthony Quayle, who had been cast as Falstaff for the second season &quot;Henry the Fourth&quot; episodes. It also helped that, unlike many of the other actors appearing in early episodes, Quayle was well-known in the US. Also in attendance were Richard Pasco, Celia Johnson, Patrick Ryecart and Helen Mirren. James Earl Jones was initially scheduled to appear, in anticipation of the second season production of &quot;Othello&quot;, but by the time of the reception, Messina had been forced to abandon casting him. In the weeks leading up to the premier, Stone/Hallinan sent out press kits for each episode, while Exxon produced TV and radio commercials, MetLife held Shakespearean open days in its head office, and sent out posters and viewer guides for each episode.

In the US, WNET planned a series of thirty-minute programs to act as general introductions to each episode. This created something of a media circus when they (half) jokingly asked Joseph Papp if he would be interested in hosting it. Ultimately, however, they abandoned the idea and simply aired the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episodes. In terms of radio publicity, in 1979, National Public Radio (NPR) aired &quot;Shakespeare Festival&quot;; a series of operas and music programs based on Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, as well as a two-hour docudrama, &quot;William Shakespeare: A Portrait in Sound&quot;, written and directed by William Luce, and starring Julie Harris and David Warner. They also broadcast a lecture series from the Lincoln Center, featuring Samuel Schoenbaum, Maynard Mack and Daniel Seltzer. Additionally, NPR station WQED-FM aired half-hour introductions to each play the week before the TV broadcast of the episode. However, when the early episodes of the show did not achieve the kind of ratings which had been initially hoped, financing for publicity quickly dried up; a Shakespeare variety show planned for PBS in 1981, set to star Charlton Heston, Robin Williams, Richard Chamberlain and Chita Rivera, failed to find an underwriter and was cancelled. The Folger Shakespeare Library&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare: The Globe and the World&quot;, a multimedia touring exhibition, was more successful and travelled to cities all over the country for the first two seasons of the show.

Much as the UK promotional efforts by the BBC focused at least partially on education, so too did US publicity, where the underwriters spent as much on the educational material as they did on underwriting the series itself. The job of handling the US educational outreach program was given to Tel-Ed, a subsidiary of Stone/Hallinan. Educational efforts were focused on middle school and high school, which is when US students first encounter Shakespeare. Tel-Ed had a three-pronged goal; to make students familiar with more plays (most schools taught only &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;), to encourage students to enjoy Shakespeare, and to have Shakespeare taught more frequently. Tel-Ed&#x27;s aim was to make the entire series available to every high school in the US. During the first season, they sent out 36,000 educational packs to English departments, receiving 18,000 requests for further information. The educational aspect of the series was considered such a success that when the show went off the air in 1985, Morgan Bank continued with educational efforts, creating &quot;The Shakespeare Hour&quot; in 1986. The concept of the show was that episodes of the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; would be presented specifically as educational tools. Planned as a three-year show with five episodes per year over a fifteen-week season, the series would group plays together thematically. Walter Matthau was hired as host, and each episode featured documentary material intercut with extensive clips from the BBC productions themselves. A book was also published with the full transcript of each episode; &quot;The Shakespeare Hour: A Companion to the PBS-TV Series&quot;, edited by Edward Quinn. In all, the first season cost $650,000, but everyone expected it to be a success. Covering the theme of love, it used &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;. However, the show achieved very poor ratings and was cancelled at the end of the first season. The second season had been set to cover power (&quot;King Richard the Second&quot;, &quot;The First Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot;, &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;), with the third looking at revenge (&quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot;, &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot;).

===Scheduling===
The scope of the series meant that from the very beginning, scheduling was a major concern. Everyone knew that achieving good ratings for thirty-seven episodes over six years was not going to be easy, and to ensure this could be accomplished, the BBC were (at first) rigorous about the show&#x27;s schedule. Each of the six seasons was to be broadcast in two sections; three weekly broadcasts in late winter, followed by a short break, and then three weekly broadcasts in early spring. This was done so as to maximise marketing in the lead-up to Christmas, and then capitalise on the traditionally quiet period in early spring. The first season followed this model perfectly, with broadcasts in 1978 on 3 December (&quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;), 10 December (&quot;King Richard the Second&quot;) and 17 December (&quot;Measure for Measure&quot;), and in 1979 on 11 February (&quot;As You Like It&quot;), 18 February (&quot;Julius Caesar&quot;) and 25 February (&quot;The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eight&quot;). All episodes were broadcast on BBC 2 on a Sunday, and all began at eight o&#x27;clock, with a five-minute interval around 9 for &quot;News on 2&quot; and a weather report. The second season began with the same system, with productions in 1979 on 9 December (&quot;The First Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot;), 16 December (&quot;The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot;) and 23 December (&quot;The Life of Henry the Fift&quot;). However, the schedule then began to run into problems. The fourth episode, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was shown on Sunday, 6 January 1980, but the fifth episode, &quot;The Tempest&quot; was not shown until Wednesday, 27 February, and the sixth, &quot;Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot; (which had been held up because of Derek Jacobi&#x27;s schedule) did not air until Sunday, 25 May.

Moving into the third season, under Jonathan Miller&#x27;s producership, the scheduling, as was commented upon by many critics at the time, seemed nothing short of random. Episode one of season three (&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;) aired on Wednesday, 23 October 1980. The following episode (&quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;) aired on Wednesday, 17 December, followed by &quot;All&#x27;s Well&quot; on Sunday, 4 January 1981, &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; on Sunday, 8 February, &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; on Thursday, 16 April and &quot;Antony &amp; Cleopatra&quot; on Friday, 8 May. Miller&#x27;s second season as producer (the show&#x27;s fourth season) was even more erratic, with only three episodes appearing during the entire season; &quot;Othello&quot; on Sunday, 4 October 1981, &quot;Troilus &amp; Cressida&quot; on Saturday, 7 November and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; on Sunday, 13 December. The next group of episodes did not air until the fifth season in September 1982, under Shaun Sutton&#x27;s producership. Sutton&#x27;s scheduling, if anything, was even more random than Miller&#x27;s; the fifth season began with &quot;King Lear&quot; on Sunday, 19 September, but this was not followed until &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; on Tuesday, 28 December. The first historical tetralogy temporarily regularised the schedule, and was aired on successive Sundays; 2, 9, 16 and 23 January 1983. The sixth season began with &quot;Cymbeline&quot; on Sunday, 10 July, but the second episode did not follow until Saturday, 5 November (&quot;Macbeth&quot;). &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; aired on Saturday, 24 December, followed only three days later by &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; on Tuesday, 27 December, with &quot;The Tragedy of Coriolanus&quot; bringing the season to a close on Saturday, 21 April 1984. Season seven aired entirely on Saturdays; &quot;The Life and Death of King John&quot; on 24 November, &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; on 8 December, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; on 22 December, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; on 5 January 1985, and finally &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; on 27 April.

US scheduling was even more complex. In the UK, each episode could start at any time and run for any length without any major problems, because shows are not trimmed to fit slots; rather slots are arranged to fit shows. In the US, however, TV worked on very rigid time slots; a show could not run, say, 138 minutes, it must run either 120 or 150 minutes to fit into the existing slot. Additionally, whereas the BBC included an intermission of five minutes roughly halfway through each show, PBS had to have an intermission every sixty minutes. Several of the shows in the first season left &#x27;gaps&#x27; in the US time slots of almost twenty minutes, which had to be filled with something. In seasons one and two, any significant time gaps at the end of a show were filled by Renaissance music performed by the Waverly Consort. When Jonathan Miller took over as producer at the end of the second season, WNET suggested something different; each episode should have a two-minute introduction, followed by interviews with the director and a cast member at the end of the episode, which would be edited to run the length necessary to plug the gaps. However, moving into season five, WNET had no money left to record any more introductions or interviews, and the only alternative was to cut the episodes to fit the time slots, much to the BBC&#x27;s chagrin. The productions that caused the most trouble were Jane Howell&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI&quot;/&quot;Richard III&quot; series. Running a total of fourteen hours, WNET felt that airing the shows in four straight back-to-back segments would not work. First, they changed the schedule to air the episodes on Sunday afternoon as opposed to the usual Monday evening screening, then they divided the three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays into two parts each. Finally, they cut a total of 77 minutes from the three productions (35 were taken from &quot;The Third Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; alone). To help trim &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot;, much early dialogue was cut, and instead a voice-over introduction recorded, ironically, by James Earl Jones was added, informing viewers of the necessary backstory. However, &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot; (the longest of the four) was aired as one piece, with only 3 minutes cut.

===Production===

====Early restrictions====
Because the US investors had put up so much money for the project, the backers were able to write aesthetic guidelines into the contract. However, as most of these guidelines conformed to Messina&#x27;s vision of the series anyway (&quot;to make solid, basic televised versions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays to reach a wide television audience and to enhance the teaching of Shakespeare&quot;), they created no major problems. The most important of these stipulations was that the productions must be &quot;traditional&quot; interpretations of the plays set in either Shakespeare&#x27;s time (1564 to 1616) or in the period of the events depicted (such as ancient Rome for &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; or &quot;c.&quot;1400 for &quot;Richard II&quot;). A two-and-a-half-hour maximum running time was also mandated, although this was soon jettisoned when it became clear that the major tragedies in particular would suffer if truncated too heavily. The initial way around this was to split the longer plays into two sections, showing them on separate nights, but this idea was also discarded, and it was agreed that for the major plays, length was not an overly important issue.

The restriction regarding conservative, traditional interpretations was non-negotiable, however. The financiers were primarily concerned with ratings, and the restrictions worked to this end, ensuring the plays had &quot;maximum acceptability to the widest possible audience.&quot; However, as practical a stipulation as this was, such decisions &quot;demonstrate that far more concern was spent on financial matters than on interpretative or aesthetic issues in planning the series.&quot; Messina himself, however, had no problem with any of these restrictions, as they conformed to his initial vision; &quot;we&#x27;ve not done anything too sensational in the shooting of it – there&#x27;s no arty-crafty shooting at all. All of them are, for want of a better word, straightforward productions.&quot;

These restrictions had a practical origin, but they soon led to a degree of aesthetic fallout;


Partly because of this aesthetic credo, the series quickly developed a reputation for being overly conventional. As a result, when Miller would later try to persuade celebrated directors such as Peter Brook, Ingmar Bergman, William Gaskill and John Dexter to direct adaptations, he would fail. Reviewing the first two seasons of the series for &quot;Critical Quarterly&quot;, in an article entitled &quot;BBC Television&#x27;s Dull Shakespeares,&quot; Martin Banham quoted from a publicity extract written by Messina in which he stated, &quot;there has been no attempt at stylisation, there are no gimmicks; no embellishments to confuse the student.&quot; Banham opined that some of the best recent theatrical productions have been extremely &quot;gimmicky&quot; in the sense of &quot;adventurous,&quot; whereas the opening two episodes of the series were simply &quot;unimaginative&quot; and more concerned with visual &quot;prettiness&quot; than dramatic quality.

In light of such criticism about the conservative nature of the early productions, Jac Venza defended the strictures, pointing out that the BBC was aiming to make programs with a long life span; they were not a theatre company producing a single run of plays for an audience already familiar with those plays, who would value novelty and innovation. They were making TV adaptations of plays for an audience the vast majority of whom would be unfamiliar with most of the material. Venza pointed out that many of the critics who most vehemently attacked the show&#x27;s traditional and conservative nature were those who were regular theatregoers and/or Shakespearean scholars, and who were essentially asking for something the BBC never intended to produce. They wanted to reach a wide audience and get more people interested in Shakespeare, and as such, novelty and experimentation were not part of the plan, a decision Venza calls &quot;very sensible.&quot;

====Seasons 1 and 2 (Cedric Messina, producer)====
Unfortunately for everyone involved in the series, production got off to the worst possible start. The inaugural episode was set to be &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, directed by Donald McWhinnie, and starring Penelope Keith and Michael York. The episode was shot (costing £250,000), edited and even publicly announced as the opening of the series before it was suddenly pulled from the schedule and replaced with &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; (which was supposed to air as the second episode). No reasons were given by the BBC for this decision, although initial newspaper reports suggested that the episode had not been abandoned, it had simply been postponed for re-shoots, due to an unspecified actor&#x27;s &quot;very heavy accent,&quot; and concerns that US audiences would not be able to understand the dialogue. However, as time wore on and no reshoots materialised, the press began to speculate that the show had been cancelled entirely, and would be replaced at a later date by a completely new adaptation, which was in fact what happened. The press also pointed out the fact that the production was never shown in Britain rubbished any suggestion that the prevailing cause for the abandonment was because of accents. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that BBC management simply regarded the production as a failure. This issue, happening as it did at the very commencement of the series, would have lasting repercussions;

Another early problem for Messina was that the US publicity campaign for the show had touted the productions as &quot;definitive&quot; adaptations of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, prompting much criticism from theatre professionals, filmmakers and academics. The claim that the show would feature &quot;definitive&quot; productions was often raised and attacked by the US media during its seven-year run, especially when an episode did not live up to expectations.

From a practical point of view, during his tenure as producer, Messina was not overly involved in the actual taping of each episode. While he chose the director, assisted in the principal casting, attended some rehearsals, visited the set from time to time, and occasionally watched the editing, the director was responsible for the major aesthetic decisions – camera placement and movement, blocking, production design, costumes, music and editing.

Messina&#x27;s legacy regarding the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; can perhaps best be seen as something of a mixed bag; &quot;what the initial Messina years cost the series in tensions, alienations, and lack of fresh thought or vigorous technical/aesthetic planning it would never recover. That we have the televised Shakespeare series at all is entirely due to Messina; that we have the Shakespeare series we have and not perhaps a better, more exciting one is also in large part due to Messina.&quot;

====Seasons 3 and 4 (Jonathan Miller, producer)====
During Messina&#x27;s tenure as producer, as per the financiers&#x27; restrictions, the adaptations tended to be conservative, but when Jonathan Miller took over at the start of season three, he completely revamped things. On a superficial level, for example, he instituted a new title sequence and replaced William Walton&#x27;s theme music with a newly composed piece by Stephen Oliver. Miller&#x27;s changes went much deeper, however. Whereas Messina had favoured a realism-based approach, which worked to simplify the texts for audiences unfamiliar with Shakespeare, Miller was against any kind of aesthetic or intellectual dilution. Messina&#x27;s theory was based on his many years of experience in television, and according to Martin Wiggins, it was exactly Miller&#x27;s lack of such experience that led to his aesthetic overhaul of the show; Miller came from

Susan Willis makes a similar point; &quot;instead of doing what the BBC usually did, Miller saw the series as a means of examining the limits of televised drama, of seeing what the medium could do; it was an imaginative, creative venture.&quot; Miller was in many ways the polar opposite of Messina;

Miller himself stated &quot;I think it&#x27;s very unwise to try to represent on the television screen something which Shakespeare did not have in his mind&#x27;s eye when he wrote those lines. You have to find some counterpart of the unfurnished stage that Shakespeare wrote for without, in fact, necessarily reproducing a version of the Globe theatre. Because there&#x27;s no way in which you can do that [...] What details you do introduce must remind the audience of the sixteenth century imagination.&quot; For Miller, the best way to do this was by using the work of famous artists as visual inspiration and reference points;

On this subject, Susan Willis writes,

As this indicates, Miller adopted a visual and design policy of sets and costumes inspired by great paintings of the era in which the plays were written, although the style was dominated by the post-Shakespearean 17th-century artists Vermeer and Rembrandt. In this sense, &quot;art provides not just a look in Miller&#x27;s productions; it provided a mode of being, a redolence of the air breathed in that world, an intellectual climate in addition to a physical space.&quot; This policy allowed other directors to stamp more of their own aesthetic credo on the productions than had been possible under Messina. According to Miller himself,

Speaking more directly, Elijah Moshinsky assessed Miller&#x27;s contribution to the series by arguing that &quot;it was only Miller&#x27;s appointment that pulled the series out of its artistic nosedive.&quot; Speaking of the US restrictions, Miller stated &quot;the brief was &quot;no monkey-tricks&quot; – but I think monkey-tricks is at least 50 percent of what interesting directing is about [...] The fact is that monkey-tricks are only monkey-tricks when they don&#x27;t work. A monkey-trick that comes off is a stroke of genius. If you start out with a quite comprehensive self-denying ordinance of &quot;no monkey tricks,&quot; then you really are very much shackled.&quot; Similarly, speaking after he had stepped aside as producer at the end of the fourth season, Miller stated &quot;I did what I wanted to do [...] The sponsors insisted that it was a traditional thing, that it didn&#x27;t disturb people by bizarre setting. And I said, okay, fine, but, I&#x27;ll disturb them with bizarre interpretations.&quot; Miller was not interested in stage tradition; he did not create a heroic Antony, a farcical &quot;Shrew&quot; or a sluttish Cressida. His &quot;Othello&quot; had little to do with race and his Lear was more of a family man than a regal titan. Miller himself spoke of his dislike for &quot;canonical performances,&quot; stating &quot;I think there is a conspiracy in the theatre to perpetuate certain prototypes in the belief that they contain the secret truth of the characters in question. This collusion between actors and directors is broken only by successful innovation which interrupts the prevailing mode.&quot;

The first episode shot under Miller&#x27;s producership was &quot;Antony &amp; Cleopatra&quot; (although the first to air would be &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;), and it was in this episode, which he also directed, where he introduced his design policies, as he set about &quot;permeating the design with the Renaissance view of the ancient world, for he observed that the Renaissance saw the classical world in terms of itself, with a contemporary rather than an archaeological awareness; they treated classical subjects but always dressed them anachronistically in Renaissance garments.&quot;

However, although there was definitely a new sense of aesthetic freedom with Miller as producer, this freedom could not be pushed too far. For example, when he hired Michael Bogdanov to direct &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, Bogdanov proposed an Orient al-themed modern-dress production. The financiers refused to sanction the idea, and Miller had to insist Bogdanov remain within the aesthetic guidelines. This led to Bogdanov quitting, and Miller himself taking over as director. One aspect of Messina&#x27;s producership which Miller did reproduce was the tendency not to get too involved in the actual shooting of the productions which he was not directing. After appointing a director and choosing a cast, he would make suggestions and be on hand to answer questions, but he believed that &quot;the job of the producer is to make conditions as favourable and friendly as they possibly can be, so that [the directors&#x27;] imagination is given the best possible chance to work.&quot;

====Seasons 5, 6 and 7 (Shaun Sutton, producer)====
Whereas the BBC had looked for an outsider to inject fresh ideas into the project at the start of season three, they turned inwards once more in finding someone to bring the series to a conclusion; Shaun Sutton. Miller had rejuvenated the series aesthetically and his productions had saved its reputation with critics, but the show had fallen behind schedule, with Miller overseeing only nine episodes instead of twelve during his two-year producership. Sutton was brought in to make sure the show was completed without going too far over schedule. Officially, Sutton produced seasons five, six and seven, but in fact, he took over producership halfway through the filming of the &quot;Henry VI&quot;/&quot;Richard III&quot; tetralogy, which was filmed from September 1981 to April 1982 and aired during season five in early 1983. Miller produced &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; and &quot;The Second Part of Henry the Sixt&quot;, Sutton produced &quot;The Third Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; and &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot;. Sutton also produced the Miller directed &quot;King Lear&quot;, which was shot in March and April 1982, and aired as the season five opener in October 1982. As such, unlike the transition from Messina to Miller, the transition from Miller to Sutton was virtually unnoticeable.

At the start of season six, Sutton followed in Miller&#x27;s footsteps by altering the opening of the show. He kept Miller&#x27;s title sequence, but he dropped Stephen Oliver&#x27;s theme music, and instead the music composed specifically for each episode served as the opening title music for that episode (except for &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;, which had no original music, so Oliver&#x27;s theme music from seasons 3–5 was used).

When asked how he felt about Messina&#x27;s time as producer, Sutton responded simply &quot;I thought the approach was a little ordinary, and that we could do better.&quot; Sutton also continued with Messina and Miller&#x27;s tendency to let the directors get on with the job;

The project was Sutton&#x27;s retirement job after twelve years as the head of BBC Drama and he was under strict orders to bring the series to a close, something which he did successfully, with the broadcast of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; roughly twelve months later than the series had initially been set to wrap.

===Reception===
Messina&#x27;s gamble in 1978 ultimately proved successful, as the series was a financial success, and by 1982 was already turning a profit. This was primarily because of sales to foreign markets, with far more countries showing the series than was initially expected; as well as the UK and the US, the show was screened in Australia, Austria, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belgium, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Czechoslovakia, Dubai, Egypt, France, Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Korea, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Venezuela, West Germany and Yugoslavia.

Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1985, Cecil Smith noted &quot;the series has been the target of critical catcalls on both sides of the Atlantic, shabbily treated by many PBS stations, and often ignored or damned as dull, dull, dull.&quot; The early episodes in particular came in for criticism. Speaking of &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, Clive James wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot; &quot;Verona seemed to have been built on very level ground, like the floor of a television studio. The fact that this artificiality was half accepted, half denied, told you that you were not in Verona at all, but in that semi-abstract, semi-concrete, wholly uninteresting city which is known to students as Messina.&quot; Also speaking of &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s Richard Last predicted, &quot;the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; will be, above all else, stylistically safe. Tradition and consolidation, rather than adventure or experiment, are to be the touchstones.&quot;

In his review of the first season for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Sean Day-Lewis stated that &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot; and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; were unsuccessful, while &quot;King Richard the Second&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; and &quot;The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eight&quot; were successful. However, even in the failures, he found qualities and as such, &quot;it has not been a bad start, given some directors new to the problems of translating Shakespeare to television.&quot;

Reviewing the second season production of &quot;The Tempest&quot; for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, Stanley Reynolds opined that although &quot;there is very little for purists to find fault with [...] the most damning thing you could say about it [is] there is nothing to stir the blood to hot flashes of anger or to the electric joy of a new experience. What we got was some more of the BBC&#x27;s ghastly middle taste.&quot;

As the series came to a close, &quot;Literary Review&quot;″s Andrew Rissik wrote &quot;it must now be apparent as the BBC wind up their Shakespeare with &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; – that the whole venture has been reckless and misguided [...] Messina&#x27;s first productions were clumsy and unspecific, badly shot in the main and indifferently cast. Miller&#x27;s productions were a clear improvement; their visual style was precise and distinctive and the casting, on the whole, intelligently done [...] But the series has not been a success.&quot; Speaking more bluntly, Michael Bogdanov called the series &quot;the greatest disservice to Shakespeare in the last 25 years.&quot;

Rebecca Saire was only fourteen when the production was filmed, an unusually young age for an actress playing Juliet, although the character is just thirteen. In interviews with the press prior to the broadcast, Saire was critical of director Alvin Rakoff, stating that in his interpretation, Juliet is too childlike and asexual. This horrified the series&#x27; producers, who cancelled several scheduled interviews with the actress in the lead-up to broadcast.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; was presented by Peggy Ashcroft, who had played Juliet in a 1932 Oxford University Dramatic Society production directed by John Gielgud. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by feminist academic and journalist Germaine Greer.

This episode was repeated on 12 December 1979 in the UK and on 19 March 1980 in the US, as a lead-in to the &quot;Henry IV&quot;/&quot;Henry V&quot; trilogy. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode which introduced &quot;King Richard the Second&quot; was presented by historian Paul Johnson, who argued that the &quot;Henriad&quot; very much advanced the Tudor myth, something also argued by Graham Holderness who saw the BBC&#x27;s presentation of the &quot;Henriad&quot; as &quot;illustrating the violation of natural social &#x27;order&#x27; by the deposition of a legitimate king.&quot;

Director David Giles shot the episode in such a way as to create a visual metaphor for Richard&#x27;s position in relation to the court. Early in the production, he is constantly seen above the rest of the characters, especially at the top of stairs, but he always descends to the same level as everyone else, and often ends up below them. As the episode goes on, his positioning above characters becomes less and less frequent. An interpretative move by Giles which was especially well received by critics was his division of Richard&#x27;s lengthy prison cell soliloquy up into several sections, which fade from one to another, suggesting a passage of time, and an ongoing slowly developing thought process.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;King Richard the Second&quot; was hosted by Ian Richardson, who had starred in a 1974 RSC production directed by John Barton, in which he had alternated the roles of Richard and Bolingbroke with actor Richard Pasco.

The production was shot at Glamis Castle in Scotland, one of only two productions shot on location, with the other being &quot;The Famous History of the Life of Henry the Eight&quot;. The location shooting received a lukewarm response from both critics and the BBC&#x27;s own people, however, with the general consensus being that the natural world in the episode overwhelmed the actors and the story. Director Basil Coleman initially felt that the play should be filmed over the course of a year, with the change in seasons from winter to summer marking the ideological change in the characters, but he was forced to shoot entirely in May, even though the play begins in winter. This, in turn, meant the harshness of the forest described in the text was replaced by lush greenery, which was distinctly unthreatening, with the characters&#x27; &quot;time in the forest appear[ing] to be more an upscale camping expedition rather than exile.&quot;

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;As You Like It&quot; was presented by Janet Suzman, who had played Rosalind in a 1967 RSC production directed by George Rylands. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by novelist Brigid Brophy.

=====Behind the scenes=====
Director Herbert Wise felt that &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; should be set in the Elizabethan era, but as per the emphasis on realism, he instead set it in a Roman &quot;milieu&quot;. Wise argued that the play &quot;is not really a Roman play. It&#x27;s an Elizabethan play and it&#x27;s a view of Rome from an Elizabethan standpoint.&quot; Regarding setting the play in Shakespeare&#x27;s day, Wise stated that, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right for the audience we will be getting. It&#x27;s not a jaded theatre audience seeing the play for the umpteenth time: for them that would be an interesting approach and might throw new light on the play. But for an audience many of whom won&#x27;t have seen the play before, I believe it would only be confusing.&quot;

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; was presented by Ronald Pickup, who had played Octavius Caesar in a 1964 Royal Court Theatre production directed by Lindsay Anderson, and Cassius in a 1977 National Theatre production directed by John Schlesinger. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by political commentator Jonathan Dimbleby.

=====Behind the scenes=====
The role of the Duke was originally offered to Alec Guinness. After he turned it down, the role was offered to a further thirty-one actors before Kenneth Colley accepted the part.

Director Desmond Davis based the brothel in the play on a traditional Western saloon and the prison on a typical horror film dungeon. The set for the episode was a 360-degree set backed by a cyclorama, which allowed actors to move from location to location without cutting – actors could walk through the streets of Vienna by circumnavigating the studio eight times. For the interview scenes, Davis decided to link them aesthetically and shot both in the same manner; Angelo was shot upwards from waist level to make him look large, Isabella was shot from further away so more background was visible in her shots, making her appear smaller. Gradually, the shots then move towards each other&#x27;s style so that, by the end of the scene, they are both shot in the same framing.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; was presented by Judi Dench, who had played Isabella in a 1962 RSC production directed by Peter Hall. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by barrister and author Sir John Mortimer.

=====Behind the scenes=====
The second of only two episodes shot on location, after &quot;As You Like It&quot;. Whereas the location shooting in that episode was heavily criticised as taking away from the play, here, the location work was celebrated. The episode was shot at Leeds Castle, Penshurst Place and Hever Castle, in the actual rooms in which some of the real events took place. Director Kevin Billington felt that location shooting was essential to the production; &quot;I wanted to get away from the idea that this is some kind of fancy pageant. I wanted to feel the reality. I wanted great stone walls [...] We shot at Hever Castle, where Anne Bullen lived; at Penhurst, which was Buckingham&#x27;s place; and at Leeds Castle, where Henry was with Anne Bullen.&quot; Shooting on location had several benefits; the camera could be set up in such a way as to show ceilings, which cannot be done when shooting in a TV studio, as rooms are ceilingless to facilitate lighting. The episode was shot in winter, and on occasions, characters&#x27; breath can be seen, which was also impossible to achieve in studio. However, because of the cost, logistics and planning required for shooting on location, Messina decided that all subsequent productions would be done in-studio, a decision which did not go down well with several of the directors lined up for work on the second season.

This episode was not originally supposed to be part of the first season, but was moved forward in the schedule to replace the abandoned production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. It was repeated on 22 June 1981.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eight&quot; was presented by Donald Sinden, who had played Henry in a 1969 RCS production directed by Trevor Nunn. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by novelist and literary scholar Anthony Burgess.

This episode starts with a reprise of the death of Richard, followed by an excerpt from the first-season episode &quot;King Richard the Second&quot;. Rumour&#x27;s opening soliloquy is then heard in voice-over, played over scenes from the previous week&#x27;s &quot;The First Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot;; Henry&#x27;s lamentation that he has not been able to visit the Holy Land, and the death of Hotspur at the hands of Prince Hal. With over a quarter of the lines from the &quot;Folio&quot; text cut, this production had more material omitted than any other in the entire series.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot; was presented by Anthony Quayle who portrayed Falstaff in the BBC adaptation, and had also played the role several times on-stage, included a celebrated 1951 RSC production, which he directed with Michael Redgrave. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by psychologist Fred Emery.

Director John Giles and production designer Don Homfray both felt this episode should look different from the two &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays. While they had been focused on rooms and domestic interiors, &quot;Henry V&quot; was focused on large open spaces. As such, because they could not shoot on location, and because creating realistic reproductions of such spaces in a studio was not possible, they decided on a more stylised approach to production design than had hitherto been seen in the series. Ironically, the finished product looked more realistic than either of them had anticipated or desired.

Dennis Channon won Best Lighting at the 1980 BAFTAs for his work on this episode. The episode was repeated on Saint George&#x27;s Day (23 April) in 1980.

Director John Gorrie interpreted &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; as an English country house comedy, and incorporated influences ranging from Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s play &quot;Il Gioco delle Parti&quot; to ITV&#x27;s &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. Gorrie also set the play during the English Civil War in the hopes the use of cavaliers and roundheads would help focus the dramatisation of the conflict between festivity and Puritanism. Gorrie wanted the episode to be as realistic as possible, and in designing Olivia&#x27;s house, made sure that the geography of the building was practical. He then shot the episode in such a way that the audience becomes aware of the logical geography, often shooting characters entering and exiting doorways into rooms and corridors.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was presented by Dorothy Tutin who had played Viola in a 1958 RSC production directed by Peter Hall. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by painter and poet David Jones.

The episode used a 360-degree set, which allowed actors to move from the beach to the cliff to the orchard without edits. The orchard was composed of real apple trees. The visual effects seen in this episode were not developed for use here. They had been developed for &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. John Gielgud was originally cast as Prospero, but contractual conflicts delayed the production, and by the time Messina had sorted them out, Gielgud was unavailable.

=====Behind the scenes=====
Originally, director Rodney Bennett had wanted to shoot the production on location, but after the first season, it was decreed that all productions were to be studio-based. Bennett made a virtue of this restriction and his &quot;Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot; &quot;was the first fully stylized production of the series.&quot; Bennett himself argued that &quot;though on the face of it, &quot;Hamlet&quot; would seem to be a great naturalistic play, it isn&#x27;t really [...] It has reality but it is essentially a theatrical reality. The way to do it is to start with nothing and gradually feed in only what&#x27;s actually required.&quot; As such, the production design was open, with ambiguous space, openings without architectural specificity and emptiness. Susan Willis argues of this episode that it &quot;was the first to affirm a theatre-based style rather than aspiring half-heartedly to the nature of film.&quot;

The episode was repeated in the US on 31 May 1982. The first screening was the highest-rated production of the entire series in North America, with viewing figures of 5.5 million.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot; was presented by Derek Jacobi who portrayed Hamlet in the BBC adaptation. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by journalist Clive James.

=====Behind the scenes=====

The production was at least partially based on Miller&#x27;s own 1972 Chichester Festival stage production starring Joan Plowright and Anthony Hopkins, and as with all of the episodes Jonathan Miller directed, he allowed the work of celebrated artisans to influence his design concepts. In the case of &quot;Shrew&quot;, the street set was based on the work of architect Sebastiano Serlio, as well as the Teatro Olimpico, designed by Andrea Palladio. Baptista&#x27;s living room was modelled closely on Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;The Music Lesson&quot;.

The casting of John Cleese as Petruchio was not without controversy. Cleese had never performed Shakespeare before, and was not a fan of the first two seasons of the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot;. As such, he took some persuading from Miller that the BBC &quot;Shrew&quot; would not be, as Cleese feared &quot;about a lot of furniture being knocked over, a lot of wine being spilled, a lot of thighs being slapped and a lot of unmotivated laughter.&quot; Miller told Cleese that the episode would interpret Petruchio as an early Puritan more concerned with attempting to show Kate how preposterous her behaviour is (&quot;showing her an image of herself&quot; as Miller put it), rather than bullying her into submission, and as such, the part was not to be acted along the traditional lines of the swaggering braggart &quot;a la&quot; Richard Burton in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1967 film adaptation. According to Cleese, who consulted a psychiatrist who specialised in treating &quot;shrews,&quot; &quot;Petruchio doesn&#x27;t believe in his own antics, but in the craftiest and most sophisticated way he needs to show Kate certain things about her behaviour. He takes one look at her and realises that here is the woman for him, but he has to go through the process of &#x27;reconditioning&#x27; her before anything else. So he behaves just as outrageously as she does in order to make her aware of the effect that her behaviour has on other people [...] Kate needs to be made happy – she is quite clearly unhappy at the beginning of the play, and then extremely happy at the end because of what she has achieved with Petruchio&#x27;s help.&quot; Miller also researched how troublesome children were treated at the Tavistock Clinic, where imitation was often used during therapy; &quot;there are ways in which a skilful therapist will gently mock a child out of a tantrum by giving an amusing imitation of the tantrum immediately after its happened. The child then has a mirror held up to it and is capable of seeing what it looks like to others.&quot; In his review of the adaptation for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Chris Dunkley referred to this issue, calling Cleese&#x27;s Petruchio &quot;an eccentrically pragmatic social worker using the wayward client&#x27;s own doubtful habits to calm her down.&quot; Actress Sarah Badel had a similar conception of the psychology behind the production. She constructed an &quot;imaginary biography&quot; for Katherina, arguing, &quot;She&#x27;s a woman of such passion [...] a woman of such enormous capacity for love that the only way she could be happy is to find a man of equal capacity. Therefore she&#x27;s mad for lack of love [...] he feigns madness, she is teetering on the edge of it. Petruchio is the only man who shows her what she&#x27;s like.&quot;

Miller was determined that the adaptation not become a farce, and in that vein, two key texts for him during production were Lawrence Stone&#x27;s &quot;The Family, Sex and Marriage in England: 1500–1800&quot; and Michael Walzer&#x27;s &quot;The Revolution of the Saints&quot;, which he used to help ground his interpretation of the play in recognisably Renaissance-esque societal terms; Petruchio&#x27;s actions are based on accepted economic, social and religious views of the time, as are Baptista&#x27;s. In tandem with this interpretation, the song sung at the end of the play is a musical version of Psalm 128 (&quot;Blessed is everyone that feareth the Lord&quot;), which was often sung in Puritan households at the end of a meal during Shakespeare&#x27;s own day, and which praised a peaceful family life. Speaking of the addition of the psalm, Miller states &quot;I had to give [the conclusion] an explicitly religious format, so people could see it as not just simply the high-jinks of an intolerantly selfish man who was simply destroying a woman to satisfy his own vanity, but a sacramental view of the nature of marriage, whereby this couple had come to love each other by reconciling themselves to the demands of a society which saw obedience as a religious requirement.&quot; Diana E. Henderson was unimpressed with this approach, writing, &quot;it was the perfect production to usher in the neo-conservative 1980s&quot; and &quot;this BBC-TV museum piece unabashedly celebrates the order achieved through female submission.&quot;

This episode premiered the new opening title sequence, and the new theme music by Stephen Oliver.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; was presented by Paola Dionisotti who had played Katherina in a 1978 RSC production directed by Michael Bogdanov.

=====Behind the scenes=====
Although this episode screened to little controversy in the UK, in the US, it created a huge furore. As soon as WNET announced the broadcast date, the Holocaust and Executive Committee (HEC) of the Committee to Bring Nazi War Criminals to Justice sent them a letter demanding the show be cancelled. WNET also received protest letters from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. Additionally, Morris Schappes, editor of &quot;Jewish Currents&quot;, wrote an open letter of protest to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The HEC stated that Shylock can arouse &quot;the deepest hate in the pathological and prejudiced mind,&quot; urging WNET &quot;that reason and a reputable insight into the psychopathology of man will impel you to cancel [the play&#x27;s] screening.&quot; They later stated, &quot;our objection is not to art but to the hate monger, whoever the target [...] This includes the singular and particular work of art which when televised is viewed by millions and alarmingly compounds the spread of hate.&quot; The ADL stated that screening the episode would be &quot;providing a forum for a Shylock who would have warmed the heart of Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher.&quot; PBS and WNET issued a joint statement citing the protests of Saudi Arabians the previous year regarding the screening of &quot;Death of a Princess&quot;, a docudrama about the public execution of Princess Mishaal, and quoting PBS president Lawrence K. Grossman; &quot;the healthy way to deal with such sensitivities is to air the concerns and criticism, not to bury or ban them.&quot; PBS and WNET also pointed out that both producer Jonathan Miller and actor Warren Mitchell are Jewish. For their part, Miller and director Jack Gold had anticipated the controversy and prepared for it. In the Stone/Hallinan press material, Gold stated, &quot;Shylock&#x27;s Jewishness in dramatic terms is a metaphor for the fact that he, more than any other character in Venice, is an alien.&quot; Miller stated, &quot;it&#x27;s not about Jews versus Christians in the racial sense; it&#x27;s the world of legislation versus the world of mercy.&quot;

Director Jack Gold chose an unusual presentational method in this episode; completely realistic and authentic costumes, but a highly stylised non-representational set against which the characters contrast; &quot;if you imagine different planes, the thing closest to the camera was the reality of the actor in a real costume – the costumes were totally real and very beautiful – then beyond the actor is a semi-artificial column or piece of wall, and in the distance is the backcloth, which is impressionistic.&quot; The backcloths were used to suggest locale without photographic representationalism; they imply air, water, sea, hills, a city, but never actually show anything specific.

Geoff Feld won Best Cameraman at the 1981 BAFTAs for his work on this episode.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; was presented by Timothy West who had played Shylock in a 1980 Old Vic production which he also directed.

=====Behind the scenes=====
In line with producer Jonathan Miller&#x27;s aesthetic policy, director Elijah Moshinsky used the work of artists as visual influence. Of particular importance was Georges de La Tour. Moshinsky showed some of de La Tour&#x27;s work to lighting technician John Summers, as he wanted to capture the dark/light contrast of the work, as well as the prominence of silhouettes and chiaroscuro effects common in the paintings. Summers loved this idea and worked it into his lighting. For example, he lit the scene where the widow agrees to Helena&#x27;s wager as if it were illuminated by a single candle. To achieve this, he used a projector bulb hidden by objects on the table to simulate the sense of a single bright light source. Summers would go on to win Best Lighting at the 1981 BAFTAs for his work on this episode.

Moshinsky was also very careful about camera placement. The opening shot is a long shot of Helena, before eventually moving into a close-up. Of this opening, Moshinsky commented &quot;I wanted to start with a long shot of Helena and not move immediately to close-up – I didn&#x27;t want too much identification with her, I wanted a picture of a woman caught in an obsession, with the camera static when she speaks, clear, judging her words. I wanted to start with long shots because I felt they were needed to place people in their context and for the sake of atmosphere. I wanted the atmosphere to help carry the story.&quot; With the exception of one shot, every shot in the episode is an interior. The only exterior shot is that of Parolles as he passes the women looking out the window in Florence. The shot is framed in such a way, however, that none of the surroundings are seen. For the shot where the King and Helena dance into the great hall, the scene was shot through a pane of glass which had the ceiling and walls of the hall painted on it, to give the appearance of a much larger and grander room than was actually present. The idea for the scenes between the King and Helena to be so sexually charged was actor Donald Sinden&#x27;s own.

Moshinsky has made contradictory statements about the end of the play. In the printed script, he indicated he felt that Bertram kissing Helena is a happy ending, but in press material for the US broadcast, he said he found the end to be sombre because none of the young characters had learnt anything.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; was presented by Sebastian Shaw who had played the King of France in a 1968 RSC production directed by John Barton. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by comedian and television writer Barry Took.

As with all of Jane Howell&#x27;s productions, this episode was performed on a single set. The change of the seasons, so critical to the movement of the play, is indicated by a lone tree whose leaves change colour as the year moves on, with the background a monochromatic cycloramic curtain, which changed colour in tune with the changing colour of the leaves.

Michael Bogdanov was originally hired to direct this episode, but he resigned after his Oriental modern-dress interpretation was considered too radical, and Jonathan Miller reluctantly took over directorial duties. In the episode, Timon&#x27;s seaside camp is littered with debris; half-buried statues and roofs of old houses from times past. This design concept stemmed from an idea Miller had originally had for &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, which he was prepping when he took over &quot;Timon&quot;. The concept was that the Greek camp had been built on the ruins of old Troy, but now the remnants of the once buried city were beginning to surface from under the earth. For the scene when Timon loses his temper after the second banquet, actor Jonathan Pryce did not know how he wanted to play the scene, so Miller simply told him to improvise. This necessitated cameraman Jim Atkinson having to keep Pryce in shot without knowing beforehand where Pryce was going to go or what he was going to do. Only once, when Pryce seems as if he is about to bend over but then suddenly stops, did Atkinson lose Pryce from centre frame.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; was presented by Richard Pasco who had played Timon in a 1980 RSC production directed by Ron Daniels. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by journalist and satirist Malcolm Muggeridge.

=====Behind the scenes=====
Although this episode was the last this season episode to air, it was the first episode shot under Jonathan Miller&#x27;s producership. He purposely interpreted it in a manner divergent from most theatrical productions. Whereas the love between Antony and Cleopatra is usually seen in a heightened manner, as a grand passion, Miller saw it as a love between two people well past their prime who are both on a &quot;downhill slide, each scrambling to maintain a foothold&quot;. He compared Antony to a football player who had waited several seasons too long to retire, and Cleopatra to a &quot;treacherous slut&quot;. Miller used Paolo Veronese&#x27;s &quot;The Family of Darius before Alexander&quot; as a major influence in his visual design of this episode, as it mixes both classical and Renaissance costumes in a single image.

This is one of only two episodes in which original Shakespearean text was substituted with additional material (the other is &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;). Controversially, Miller and his script editor David Snodin cut Act 3, Scene 10 and replaced it with the description of the Battle of Actium from Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, which is delivered as an onscreen legend overlaying a painting of the battle.

During rehearsal of the scene with the snake, Jane Lapotaire, who suffers from ophidiophobia, was extremely nervous, but was assured the snake was well-trained. At that point, the snake crawled down the front of her dress towards her breast, before then moving around her back. During the shooting of the scene, Lapotaire kept her hands on the snake at all times.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;Antony &amp; Cleopatra&quot; was presented by Barbara Jefford who had played Cleopatra in a 1965 Oxford Playhouse production directed by Frank Hauser. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by &quot;agony aunt&quot; Anna Raeburn.

=====Behind the scenes=====
Cedric Messina had planned to screen &quot;Othello&quot; during the second season, and had attempted to cast James Earl Jones in the part. However, the British Actors&#x27; Equity Association had written into their contract with the BBC that only British actors could appear in the series, and if Messina cast Jones, Equity threatened to strike, thus crippling the show. Messina backed down and &quot;Othello&quot; was pushed back to a later season. By the time it was produced, Jonathan Miller had taken over as producer, and he decided that the play was not about race at all, casting a white actor in the role.

During production, Miller based the visual design on the work of El Greco. The interior design of the production was based on the interiors of the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino, while the street set was based on a real street in Cyprus. For the scene where Iago asks Cassio about Bianca, Othello stands behind the open door. Most of the scene is shot from behind him, so the audience sees what he sees. However, not all the dialogue between Iago and Cassio is audible, which led to criticism when the episode was screened in the US, where it was assumed that the sound people simply had not done their job. It was, in fact, an intentional choice; if Othello is having difficulty hearing what they are saying, so too is the audience. Bob Hoskins played Iago as a Rumpelstiltskin type, an impish troublemaker who delights in petty mischief and mocks people behind their backs.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;Othello&quot; was presented by Bob Peck who had played Iago in a 1979 RSC production directed by Ronald Eyre. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by author Susan Hill.

=====Behind the scenes=====
Director Jonathan Miller used the work of gothic painter Lucas Cranach as primary visual influence during this production. Several of Cranach&#x27;s sketches can be seen in Ajax&#x27;s tent, most notably, Eve from his &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; woodcut, hung on the tent like a nude centrefold. Miller wanted Troy to be sharply differentiated from Greece; Troy was decadent, with clear abstract lines (based on some of Hans Vredeman de Vries&#x27; architectural experiments with perspective). Costumes were elegant and bright, based on the works of Cranach and Albrecht Dürer. The Greek camp, on the other hand, was based on a gypsy camp near the BBC Television Centre; cluttered, dirty and squalid. Miller envisioned it as built on the remains of an earlier Troy, with bits of roofs jutting out of the ground and bits and pieces of ancient statues lying around (although this idea originated for &quot;Troilus&quot;, Miller had first used it in his earlier &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;). Also, on one side of the camp, a huge wooden horse leg can be seen under construction – the Trojan Horse. In the command tent, a schematic for the horse is visible in several scenes, as is a scale model on the desk nearby. Miller wanted the camp to give the sense of &quot;everything going downhill,&quot; with the men demoralised, fed up fighting, wanting only to get drunk and sleep (except Ulysses, who is depicted as still fully alert) The uniforms were all khaki coloured, and although Renaissance in style, were based on the TV show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, with Thersites specifically based on Corporal Klinger.

Of the play, Miller stated &quot;it&#x27;s ironic, it&#x27;s farcical, it&#x27;s satirical: I think it&#x27;s an entertaining, rather frothily ironic play. It&#x27;s got a bitter-sweet quality, rather like black chocolate. It has a wonderfully light ironic touch and I think it should be played ironically, not with heavy-handed agonising on the dreadful futility of it all.&quot; Miller chose to set the play in a Renaissance &quot;milieu&quot; rather than a classical one, as he felt it was really about Elizabethan England rather than ancient Troy, and as such, he hoped the production would carry relevance for a contemporary TV audience; &quot;I feel that Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and all the works of the classic rank, of literary antiquity, must necessarily be Janus-faced. And one merely pretends that one is producing pure Renaissance drama; I think one has to see it in one&#x27;s own terms. Because it is constantly making references, one might as well be a little more specific about it. Now that doesn&#x27;t mean that I want to hijack them for the purposes of making the plays address themselves specifically to modern problems. I think what one wants to do is to have these little anachronistic overtones so that we&#x27;re constantly aware of the fact that the play is, as it were, suspended in the twentieth-century imagination, halfway between the period in which it was written and the period in which we are witnessing it. And then there is of course a third period being referred to, which is the period of the Greek antiquity.&quot;

Jim Atkinson won Best Cameraman at the 1982 BAFTAs for his work on this episode.

Jonathan Miller planned on directing this episode himself, with fairies inspired by the work of Inigo Jones and Hieronymus Bosch, but he directed &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; instead, after original director Michael Bogdanov quit that production. Elijah Moshinsky based his fairies on the baroque eroticism of Rembrandt and Peter Paul Rubens; in particular Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Danaë&quot; was used as the inspiration for Titania&#x27;s bed. Fashioning a darker production than is usual for this play, Moshinsky referred to the style of the adaptation as &quot;romantic realism.&quot; He disliked productions which portrayed Puck as a mischievous but harmless and lovable sprite, so he had Phil Daniels play him as if he were an anti-establishment punk. It has long been rumoured, but never confirmed, that in his portrayal of Peter Quince, actor Geoffrey Palmer was imitating the soon-to-retire Director General of the BBC, Ian Trethowan.

=====Behind the scenes=====
Originally, Cedric Messina had cast Robert Shaw to play Lear, with an aim to do the show during the second season, but Shaw died suddenly in 1978 before production could begin, and the play was pushed back. Jonathan Miller had previously directed a Nottingham Playhouse production of &quot;King Lear&quot; in 1969, starring Michael Hordern as Lear and Frank Middlemass as the Fool. In 1975, he remounted that same production for the BBC &quot;Play of the Month&quot;, a heavily truncated version, which happened to be the BBC&#x27;s last Shakespeare production prior to the beginning of the &quot;Television Shakespeare&quot;. During his producership, Miller tried to persuade the BBC to use the &quot;Play of the Month&quot; production as their &quot;Lear&quot;, but they refused, saying a new production had to be done. At the end of the fourth season, Miller&#x27;s last as producer, his contract stipulated that he still had one production to direct. In-coming producer Shaun Sutton offered him &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, but Miller wanted to do one of the three remaining tragedies; &quot;Lear&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; or &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. He had never directed &quot;Macbeth&quot; or &quot;Coriolanus&quot; before, but he felt so comfortable with &quot;Lear&quot; that he went with it. The production was much the same as his 1969/1975 version, with the same two leading actors, the same costume design, the same lighting, and the same design concept. The only significant difference is that more of the text is used in the latter production. Miller used a &quot;board and drapes&quot; approach to the play; all interiors were shot on or near a plain wooden platform while all exteriors were shot against a cycloramic curtain with dark tarpaulins. As such, although exteriors and interiors were clearly distinguished from one another, both were nonrepresentational. To enhance the starkness of the look of the production, Miller had lighting technician John Treays desaturate the colour by 30 per cent. Miller also used colour to connect characters; the Fool wears white makeup which washes off during the storm, Edgar wears a white mask when he challenges Edmund to fight, and Cordelia wears white makeup after her death. Similarly, the Fool has red feathers in his hat, Edgar has a red tunic, and Cordelia&#x27;s red welts on her neck stand out starkly against the white of her skin after her death.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;King Lear&quot; was presented by Tony Church who had played the Fool in a 1962 RSC production directed by Peter Brook. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by literary critic Frank Kermode.

Director David Jones wanted to shoot the episode in Stratford-upon-Avon but was restricted to a studio setting. Determined that the production be as realistic as possible, Jones had designer Dom Homfray base the set on real Tudor houses associated with Shakespeare; Falstaff&#x27;s room is based on the home of Mary Arden (Shakespeare&#x27;s mother) in Wilmcote, and the wives&#x27; houses are based on the house of Shakespeare&#x27;s daughter Susanna, and her husband, John Hall. For the background of exterior shots, he used a miniature Tudor village built of plasticine. Homfray won Best Production Designer at the 1983 BAFTAs for his work on this episode.

Jones was determined that the two wives not be clones of one another, so he had them appear as if Page was a well-established member of the bourgeoisie and Ford a member of the &quot;nouveau riche&quot;.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; was presented by Prunella Scales who portrayed Mistress Page in the BBC adaptation. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by novelist Jilly Cooper.

=====Behind the scenes=====

Inspired by the notion that the political intrigues behind the Wars of the Roses often seemed like playground squabbles, Howell and production designer Oliver Bayldon staged the four plays in a single set resembling a children&#x27;s adventure playground. However, little attempt was made at realism. For example, Bayldon did not disguise the parquet flooring (&quot;it stops the set from literally representing [...] it reminds us we are in a modern television studio&quot;), and in all four productions, the title of the play is displayed within the set itself (on banners in &quot;The First Part&quot; and &quot;The Second Part&quot; (where it is visible throughout the entire first scene), on a shroud in &quot;The Third Part&quot;, and written on a chalkboard by Richard himself in &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot;). Many critics felt these set design choices lent the production an air of Brechtian &quot;verfremdungseffekt&quot;. Stanley Wells wrote of the set that it was intended to invite the viewer to &quot;accept the play&#x27;s artificiality of language and action.&quot; Michael Hattaway describes it as &quot;anti-illusionist.&quot; Susan Willis argues it allows the productions &quot;to reach theatrically toward the modern world.&quot; Ronald Knowles writes, &quot;a major aspect of the set was the subliminal suggestion of childlike anarchy, role-playing, rivalry, game and vandalism, as if all culture were precariously balanced on the shaky foundations of atavistic aggression and power-mad possession.&quot;

Another element of &quot;verfremdungseffekt&quot; in this production is seen when Gloucester and Winchester encounter one another at the Tower; both are on horseback, but the horses they ride are hobbyhorses, which actors David Burke and Frank Middlemass cause to pivot and prance as they speak. The ridiculousness of this situation works to &quot;effectively undercut their characters&#x27; dignity and status.&quot; The &quot;anti-illusionist&quot; set was also used as a means of political commentary; as the four plays progressed, the set decayed and became more and more dilapidated as social order becomes more fractious. In the same vein, the costumes become more and more monotone as the four plays move on – &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; features brightly coloured costumes which clearly distinguish the various combatants from one another, but by &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot;, everyone fights in similarly coloured dark costumes, with little to differentiate one army from another.

Graham Holderness saw Howell&#x27;s non-naturalistic production as something of a reaction to the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of the &quot;Henriad&quot; in seasons one and two, which had been directed by David Giles in a traditional and straightforward manner; &quot;where Messina saw the history plays conventionally as orthodox Tudor historiography, and [David Giles] employed dramatic techniques which allow that ideology a free and unhampered passage to the spectator, Jane Howell takes a more complex view of the first tetralogy as, simultaneously, a serious attempt at historical interpretation, and as a drama with a peculiarly modern relevance and contemporary application. The plays, to this director, are not a dramatization of the Elizabethan World Picture but a sustained interrogation of residual and emergent ideologies in a changing society [...] This awareness of the multiplicity of potential meanings in the play required a decisive and scrupulous avoidance of television or theatrical naturalism: methods of production should operate to open the plays out, rather than close them into the immediately recognisable familiarity of conventional Shakespearean production.&quot;

Howell&#x27;s presentation of the complete first historical tetralogy was one of the most lauded achievements of the entire BBC series, and prompted Stanley Wells to argue that the productions were &quot;probably purer than any version given in the theatre since Shakespeare&#x27;s time.&quot; Michael Mannheim was similarly impressed, calling the tetralogy &quot;a fascinating, fast paced and surprisingly tight-knit study in political and national deterioration.&quot;

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; was presented by Brewster Mason who had played Warwick in the 1963 RSC production &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; directed by John Barton and Peter Hall.

=====Behind the scenes=====

This episode was filmed on the same set as &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot;. However, designer Oliver Bayldon altered the set so it would appear that the paintwork was flaking and peeling, and the set falling into a state of disrepair, as England descended into an ever-increasing state of chaos. In the same vein, the costumes became more and more monotone as the four plays went on; &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; features brightly coloured costumes which clearly distinguish the various combatants from one another, but by &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot;, everyone fights in similarly coloured dark costumes, with little to differentiate one army from another.

A strong element of &quot;verfremdungseffekt&quot; in this production is the use of doubling, particularly in relation to actors David Burke and Trevor Peacock. Burke plays Henry&#x27;s most loyal servant, Gloucester, but after Gloucester&#x27;s death, he plays Jack Cade&#x27;s right-hand man, Dick the Butcher. Peacock plays Cade himself, having previously appeared in &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; as Lord Talbot, representative of the English chivalry so loved by Henry. Both actors play complete inversions of their previous characters, re-creating both an authentically Elizabethan theatrical practice and providing a Brechtian political commentary.

This episode was filmed on the same set as &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; and &quot;The Second Part of Henry the Sixt&quot;. However, designer Oliver Bayldon altered the set so it would appear to be falling apart, as England descended into an even worse state of chaos.

The scene where Richard kills Henry has three biblical references carefully worked out by Howell: as Richard drags Henry away, his arms spread out into a crucified position; on the table at which he sat are seen bread and wine; and in the background, an iron crossbar is illuminated against the black stone wall.

Howell&#x27;s presentation of the complete first historical tetralogy was one of the most lauded achievements of the entire BBC series, and prompted Stanley Wells to argue that the productions were &quot;probably purer than any version given in the theatre since Shakespeare&#x27;s time.&quot; Michael Mannheim was similarly impressed, calling the tetralogy &quot;a fascinating, fast paced and surprisingly tight-knit study in political and national deterioration.&quot;

=====Behind the scenes=====

This episode was filmed on the same set as the three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays. However, designer Oliver Bayldon altered the set so it would appear to be a ruin, as England reached its lowest point of chaos. In the same vein, the costumes became more and more monotone as the four plays went on; &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; features brightly coloured costumes which clearly distinguish the various combatants from one another, but by &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot;, everyone fights in similarly coloured dark costumes, with little to differentiate one army from another.

As this version of &quot;Richard III&quot; functioned as the fourth part of a series, it meant that much of the text usually cut in standalone productions could remain. The most obvious beneficiary of this was the character of Margaret, whose role, if not removed completely, is usually truncated. Textual editor David Snodin was especially pleased that a filmed version of &quot;Richard III&quot; was finally presenting Margaret&#x27;s full role. Director Jane Howell also saw the unedited nature of the tetralogy as important for Richard himself, arguing that without the three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays &quot;it is impossible to appreciate Richard except as some sort of diabolical c,&quot; whereas in the full context of the tetralogy &quot;you&#x27;ve seen why he is created, you know how such a man can be created: he was brought up in war, he saw and knew nothing else from his father but the struggle for the crown, and if you&#x27;ve been brought up to fight, if you&#x27;ve got a great deal of energy, and physical handicaps, what do you do? You take to intrigue and plotting.&quot;

The production is unusual amongst filmed &quot;Richard&quot;s insofar as no one is killed on camera, other than Richard himself. This was a conscious choice on the part of Howell; &quot;you see nobody killed; just people going away, being taken away – so much like today; they&#x27;re just removed. There&#x27;s a knock on the door and people are almost willing to go. There&#x27;s no way out of it.&quot;

Controversially, the episode ended with Margaret sitting atop a pyramid of corpses (played by all of the major actors who had appeared throughout the tetralogy) cradling Richard&#x27;s dead body and laughing manically, an image Edward Burns refers to as &quot;a blasphemous &quot;pietà&quot;.&quot; Howell herself referred to it as a &quot;reverse pietà,&quot; and defended it by arguing that the tetralogy is bigger than &quot;Richard III&quot;, so to end by simply showing Richard&#x27;s death and Richmond&#x27;s coronation is to diminish the roles that have gone before; the vast amount of death that has preceded the end of &quot;Richard III&quot; cannot be ignored. R. Chris Hassel Jr. remarks of this scene that &quot;our last taste is not the restoration of order and good governance, but of chaos and arbitrary violence.&quot; Hugh M. Richmond says the scene gives the production a &quot;cynical conclusion,&quot; as &quot;it leaves our impressions of the new King Henry VII&#x27;s reign strongly coloured by Margaret&#x27;s malevolent glee at the destruction of her enemies that Henry has accomplished for her.&quot;

Howell&#x27;s presentation of the complete first historical tetralogy was one of the most lauded achievements of the entire BBC series, and prompted Stanley Wells to argue that the productions were &quot;probably purer than any version given in the theatre since Shakespeare&#x27;s time.&quot; Michael Mannheim was similarly impressed, calling the tetralogy &quot;a fascinating, fast paced and surprisingly tight-knit study in political and national deterioration.&quot;

At 239 minutes, this production was the longest episode in the entire series, and when the series was released on DVD in 2005, it was the only adaptation split over two disks. Of the 3,887 lines comprising the &quot;First Folio&quot; text of the play, Howell cut only 72; roughly 1.8% of the total.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot; was presented by Edward Woodward who had played Richard in a 1982 Ludlow Festival production directed by David William.

=====Behind the scenes=====
From this episode on, the show featured no unique theme music; the opening titles were scored with music composed specifically for the episode; although the new title sequence introduced by Miller at the start of the third season continued to be used.

During the episode, the battle between the Romans and the Britons is never shown on screen; all that is seen is a single burning building, intended to indicate the general strife; we never see the defeat of Iachimo, Posthumus sparing him or Iachimo&#x27;s reaction. Moshinsky did not want to expunge the political context of the play, but he was not especially interested in the military theme, and so removed most of it, with an aim to focus instead on the personal. Moshinsky shot the scene of Iachimo watching the sleeping Imogen in the same way as he shot the scene of Imogen finding Cloten in bed beside her; as Iachimo leaves the room, the camera is at the head of the bed, and as such, Imogen appears upside-down in frame. Later, when she awakes to find the headless Cloten, the scene begins with the camera in the same position, with Imogen once again upside-down; &quot;the inverted images visually bind the perverse experiences, both nightmarish, both sleep related, both lit by one candle.&quot; Moshinsky used Rembrandt&#x27;s portrait of Agatha Bas as inspiration for Imogen&#x27;s costume.

Director James Cellan Jones felt very strongly that the play was not just a farce, but included a serious side, specifically represented by the character of Aegeon, who has lost his family and is about to lose his life. In several productions Jones had seen, Aegeon was completely forgotten between the first and last scenes, and determined to avoid this, and hence give the production a more serious air, Jones had Aegeon wandering around Ephesus throughout the episode.

This production used editing and special effects to have each set of twins played by the same actors. However, this was not well received by critics, who argued that not only was it confusing for the audience as to which character was which, but much of the comedy was lost when the characters look identical.

The entire production takes place on a stylised set, the floor of which is a giant map of the region, shown in its entirety in the opening and closing aerial shots; all of the main locations (the Porpentine, the Abbey, the Phoenix, the market etc.) are located in a circular pattern around the centre map.

The music in this episode was created by Anthony Rooley, who wrote new arrangements of works from Shakespeare&#x27;s own time, such as John Dowland&#x27;s piece &#x27;Lachrimae&#x27;. Performed by The Consort of Musicke, other musicians whose music was used include William Byrd, Thomas Campion, Anthony Holborne, John Johnson, Thomas Morley and Orazio Vecchi. As no original music was used, Stephen Oliver&#x27;s theme from seasons three to five was used for the opening titles.

Director Don Taylor initially planned a representational setting for the film; Verona, Milan and the forest were all to be realistic. However, he changed his mind early in preproduction and had production designer Barbara Gosnold go in the opposite direction, choosing a stylised setting. To this end, the forest is composed of metal poles with bits of green tinsel and brown sticks stuck to them (the cast and crew referred to the set as &quot;Christmas at Selfridges&quot;). While the set for Verona was more realistic, that for Milan featured young extras dressed like cherubs. This was to convey the idea that the characters lived in a &quot;Garden of Courtly Love&quot;, slightly divorced from everyday reality. Working in tandem with this idea, upon Proteus&#x27; arrival in Milan, after meeting Silvia, he is left alone on stage, and the weather suddenly changes from calm and sunny to cloudy and windy, accompanied by a thunderclap. The implication being that Proteus has brought a darkness within him into the garden of courtly delights previously experienced by Silvia.

Although the production is edited in a fairly conventional manner, much of it was shot in extremely long takes, and then edited into sections, rather than actually shooting in sections. Taylor would shoot most of the scenes in single takes, as he felt this enhanced performances and allowed actors to discover aspects which they never would have had everything been broken up into pieces.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; was presented by Geoffrey Hutchings who had played Launce in a 1969 RSC production directed by Gareth Morgan. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by journalist Russell Davies.

=====Behind the scenes=====
The production design of Rome in this episode was very specific; everywhere except the Senate was to be small and cramped. The idea behind this design choice was to reflect Coriolanus&#x27; mindset. He dislikes the notion of the people gathering together for anything, and on such a cramped set, because the alleys and streets are so small, it only takes a few people to make them look dangerously crowded. When Caius Marcius fights the Coriolian soldiers, he leaves his shirt on, but when he fights Aufidius in one-on-one combat, he takes it off. Moshinsky did this to give the scene an undercurrent of homoeroticism. In the script for the episode, Coriolanus&#x27; death scene is played as a fight between himself and Aufidius in front of a large crowd who urge Aufidius to kill him. However, in shooting the scene, Moshinsky changed it so that it takes place in front of a few silent senators, and there is, as such, no real fight.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;The Tragedy of Coriolanus&quot; was presented by Ian Hogg who had played Coriolanus in a 1972 RSC production directed by Trevor Nunn. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by General Sir John Hackett.

=====Behind the scenes=====
The inaugural episode of the entire series was originally set to be a production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, directed by Donald McWhinnie, and starring Penelope Keith and Michael York. The episode was shot (for £250,000), edited and even publicly announced as the opening of the series, before it was suddenly pulled from the schedule and replaced with &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, originally intended as the second episode. No reasons were given by the BBC for this decision, although initial newspaper reports suggested that the episode had not been abandoned, but postponed for reshoots, due to an unspecified actor&#x27;s &quot;very heavy accent,&quot; and concerns that US audiences would not be able to understand the dialogue. However, no reshoots materialised, and the press began to speculate that the show had been cancelled entirely, and would be replaced at a later date by a new adaptation, which was, in fact, what happened. The press also pointed out that the fact that the production was never shown in Britain undermined the suggestion that the cause of the abandonment was to do with accents. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that BBC management simply regarded the production as a failure.

During the reshoot for the seventh season, director Stuart Burge considered shooting the entire episode against a blank tapestry background, with no set whatsoever, but it was felt that audiences would not respond well to this, and the idea was scrapped. Ultimately the production used &quot;stylized realism&quot;; the environments are suggestive of their real-life counterparts, the foregrounds are broadly realistic representations, but the backgrounds tended to be more artificial; &quot;a representational context close to the actors, with a more stylized presentation of distance.&quot;

Jan Spoczynski won Designer of the Year at the 1985 Royal Television Society Awards for his work on this episode.

=====Behind the scenes=====

Director Elijah Moshinsky used the paintings of Jean-Antoine Watteau, especially his use of &quot;fête galante&quot; in pictures such as &quot;L&#x27;Embarquement pour Cythère&quot;, the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the writing of Pierre de Marivaux as inspiration during the making of this episode, which is the only play of the thirty-seven to be set in the eighteenth century. Of the play, Moshinsky said, &quot;it has the atmosphere of Marivaux – which is rather delicious, and yet full of formalised rules between men and women, sense against sensibility; there&#x27;s a distinction between enlightenment and feeling. I think the atmosphere of Watteau&#x27;s paintings suits this enormously well and gives it a lightness of touch. And also it abstracts it; we don&#x27;t want anything too realistic because the whole thing is a kind of mathematical equation – four men for four women – and the play is testing certain propositions about love.&quot; To ensure that the image match the &quot;fête galante&quot; style, Moshinsky had lighting technician John Summers use floor lighting as opposed to the usual method of ceiling lighting for some of the exterior scenes, also shooting through a very light gauze to create a softness in line and colour.

For Moshinsky, the central episode of the production is the play-within-the-play in the final scene which is interrupted by the arrival of Marcade, an episode to which Moshinsky refers as &quot;an astonishing sleight of hand about reality and the reflection of experiencing reality.&quot; He argues that the audience is so wrapped up in watching the characters watch the pageant that they have forgotten reality, and the arrival of Marcade with news of the death of the King of France jolts the audience back to reality in the same way it jolts the eight main characters. In this sense, Moshinsky sees the play more as about artifice and reality than romantic relationships.

This was one of only two productions which replaced original dialogue with material from outside the play (the other was Jonathan Miller&#x27;s &quot;Anthony &amp; Cleopatra&quot;). Here, in an invented scene set between Act 2 Scene 1 and Act 3, Scene 1, Berowne is shown drafting the poem to Rosaline, which will later be read by Nathaniel to Jacquenetta. The lines in this invented scene (delivered in voice-over) are taken from the fifth poem of the William Jaggard publication &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot;, a variant of Berowne&#x27;s final version of his own poem.

This was the only production that John Wilders, the series literary advisor, criticised publicly. Specifically, he objected to the character of Moth being portrayed by an adult actor.

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; was presented by Kenneth Branagh who had played Navarre in a 1984 RSC production directed by Barry Kyle. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by novelist Emma Tennant.

=====Behind the scenes=====

As &quot;Titus&quot; was broadcast several months after the rest of the seventh season, it was rumoured that the BBC were worried about the violence in the play and that disagreements had arisen about censorship. In reality, however, the delay was caused by logistical issues beginning with a BBC strike in 1984. The episode had been booked into the studio in February and March 1984, but the strike meant it could not shoot. When the strike ended, the studio could not be used as it was being used by another production, and then when the studio became available, the RSC was using Trevor Peacock. Thus filming did not take place until February 1985, a year later than planned.

Director Jane Howell had toyed with the idea of setting the play in a contemporary Northern Ireland, but settled on a more conventional approach. All the body parts seen throughout were based upon real autopsy photographs and were authenticated by the Royal College of Surgeons. The costumes of the Goths were based on punk outfits, with Chiron and Demetrius specifically based on the band KISS. For the scene when Chiron and Demetrius are killed, a large carcass is seen hanging nearby; this was a genuine lamb carcass purchased from a kosher butcher and smeared with Vaseline to make it gleam under the studio lighting. In an unusual design choice, Howell had the Roman populace all wear identical generic masks without mouths, so as to convey the idea that the Roman people were faceless and voiceless, as she felt the play depicted a society which &quot;seemed like a society where everyone was faceless except for those in power.&quot; In the opening scene, as the former emperor&#x27;s body is carried out, only Saturninus and Bassianus take their masks away from their faces, no one else, and they do so only to glare at one another.

In a significant departure from the text, Howell set Young Lucius as the centre of the production so as to prompt the question &quot;What are we doing to the children?&quot; At the end of the play, as Lucius delivers his final speech, the camera stays on Young Lucius rather than his father, who is in the far background and out of focus, as he stares in horror at the coffin of Aaron&#x27;s child (which has been killed off-screen). Thus the production became &quot;in part about a boy&#x27;s reaction to murder and mutilation. We see him losing his innocence and being drawn into this adventure of revenge; yet, at the end we perceive that he retains the capacity for compassion and sympathy.&quot;

The &quot;Prefaces to Shakespeare&quot; episode for &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; was presented by Patrick Stewart who had played Titus in a 1981 RSC production directed by John Barton. The &quot;Shakespeare in Perspective&quot; episode was presented by psychiatrist Anthony Clare.

==Omissions and changes==
All line references are taken from the individual Oxford Shakespeare editions of each play.
* The Taming of the Shrew
** The Induction and the interjection of Christopher Sly at the end of 1.1 are absent.
** Several lines are omitted from the conversation between Grumio and Curtis in 4.1
** The brief conversation between Biondello and Lucentio which opens 5.1 is absent.
** 5.2 ends differently from the play. The last line spoken is Petruchio&#x27;s &quot;We three are married, but you two are sped;&quot; thus omitting Petruchio&#x27;s comment to Lucentio Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white,/And being a winner, God give you good night,&quot; as well as Hortensio&#x27;s line, &quot;Now go thy ways, thou has tamed a curst shrew,&quot; and Lucentio&#x27;s closing statement, Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.&quot; Additionally, Petruchio and Katherina do not leave the banquet prior to the end of the play but remain, and engage in a song with all present.
* The First Part of Henry the Sixt
** Lines are omitted from almost every scene. Some of the more notable omissions include, in 1.1, Bedford&#x27;s references to children crying and England becoming a marsh since Henry V died (ll.48–51). In 1.2, Alençon&#x27;s praise of the resoluteness of the English army is absent (ll.29–34). In 1.5, Talbot&#x27;s complaint about the French wanting to ransom him for a prisoner of less worth is absent (ll.8–11). In 1.7, some of Charles&#x27; praise of Joan is absent (ll.21–27). In 4.6, some of the dialogue between Talbot and John is absent (ll.6–25). In 4.7, twelve of Joan&#x27;s sixteen lines are cut; the entire seven-line speech where she says John Talbot refused to fight her because she is a woman (ll.37–43), the first three lines of her five-line mockery of Lucy&#x27;s listing of Talbot&#x27;s titles (ll.72–75), and the first two lines of her four-line speech where she mocks Lucy as he is about to take over Talbot&#x27;s position (ll.86–88).
** The adaptation opens differently from the text, as we see Henry VI singing a lament for his father.
** Fastolf&#x27;s escape from Rouen is seen rather than merely mentioned.
** 5.1 and 5.2 are reversed so that 4.7 and 5.2 now form one continuous piece.
** The Duke of Burgundy is seen to be killed prior to Joan&#x27;s capture; in the text, his fate is unknown.
** The character of Warwick as portrayed by Mark Wing-Davey is Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick. In the play, however, the character is Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, Neville&#x27;s father-in-law.
* The Second Part of Henry the Sixt
** Lines are omitted from almost every scene. Some of the more notable omissions include, in 1.1, both of Humphrey&#x27;s references to Bedford are absent (ll. 82–83, 95–96), as is the reference to Suffolk&#x27;s demands that he be paid for escorting Margaret from France (ll. 131–133), and York&#x27;s allusion to Althaea and Calydon in his closing soliloquy (ll.231–235). York&#x27;s outline of Edward III&#x27;s seven sons is absent from 2.2 (ll.10–17), as is Salisbury&#x27;s reference to Owen Glendower (l.41). Suffolk&#x27;s accusation that Humphrey was involved in necromancy with Eleanor is omitted from 3.1 (ll.47–53), as is Humphrey&#x27;s outline of how he dealt with criminals during his time as Lord Protector (ll.128–132). Also absent from 3.1 is York&#x27;s reference to how he fought alongside Cade in Ireland (ll.360–370). In 4.1, all references to Walter Whitmore&#x27;s name as Gualtier are absent. The entirety of 4.5 (a brief scene showing Lord Scales and Matthew Gough on patrol at the Tower of London) is absent. In 5.1, some of the dialogue between Clifford and Warwick is absent (ll.200–210).
** Some lines have also been added to the play. In 1.1, two lines are added to Salisbury&#x27;s vow to support York if he can prove he is a legitimate heir to the crown; &quot;The reverence of mine age and the Neville&#x27;s name/Is of no little force if I command&quot; (added between ll.197 and 198). In 1.3, two lines are added to the conversation between Margaret and Thump, where Thump mistakes the word &#x27;usurper&#x27; for &#x27;usurer&#x27; and is corrected by Margaret (between ll.31 and 32). In 2.1, the conversation between Humphrey and Beaufort is extended, wherein Humphrey says that Beaufort was born &quot;in bastardy.&quot; All of these additional lines are taken from the 1594 quarto of the play, &quot;The First part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster&quot;.
** Several lines are spoken by characters other than who speak in the &quot;Folio&quot; text. In 1.3, Humphrey&#x27;s line &quot;This is the law and this Duke Humphrey&#x27;s doom&quot; is given to Henry. In 1.4, during the conjuration, there is no separate spirit in the scene; all the spirit&#x27;s dialogue is spoken &#x27;through&#x27; Magarey Jourdayne. Also, later in this scene, it is Buckingham who reads the prophecies, not York. In 4.1, the second half of line 139 (&quot;Pompey the Great and Suffolk dies by pirates&quot;) is given to the Lieutenant.
** The character of George Plantagenet is introduced towards the end of the play, just prior to the Battle of St Albans, with which the play closes. In the text, however, George is not introduced until &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, 2.2.
** The character of Buckingham is killed onscreen. In the play, his fate is unknown, and it is only revealed in the opening lines of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; that he had been killed by Edward.
** The play ends slightly differently from the directions in the text. After the battle, the victorious House of York leave the stage, all except Salisbury, who sadly looks around the field of battle at the many dead bodies.
* The Third Part of Henry the Sixt
** Lines are omitted from almost every scene. Some of the more notable omissions include the opening twenty-four lines of the first scene. Instead, the play begins with Warwick proclaiming, &quot;This is the palace of the fearful king.&quot; Also in 1.1, all references to Margaret chairing a session of parliament are absent (ll.35–42), as are her references to the pains of childbirth, and Henry&#x27;s shameful behaviour in disinheriting his son (ll.221–226). Absent from 1.3 is Rutland&#x27;s appeal to Clifford&#x27;s paternal instincts (ll.41–43). In 2.1, all references to Clarence&#x27;s entry into the conflict are absent, as he had already been introduced as a combatant at the end of &quot;The Second Part of Henry VI&quot;. During the debate between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians in 2.2, Richard&#x27;s &quot;Northumberland, I hold thee reverentially&quot; is absent (l.109). In 3.3, Warwick&#x27;s reference to Salisbury&#x27;s death and the incident with his niece are both absent (ll.186–188). In 4.4, the first twelve lines are absent (where Elizabeth reports to Rivers that Edward has been captured).
** Some lines are also added to the play. In 1.1, four lines are added at the beginning of Henry&#x27;s declaration that he would rather see civil war than yield the throne; &quot;Ah Plantagenet, why seekest thou to depose me?/Are we not both Plantagenets by birth?/And from two brothers lineally descent?/Suppose by right and equity thou be king.&quot; Also in 1.1, a line is inserted when York asks Henry if he agrees to the truce and Henry replies, &quot;Convey the soldiers hence, and then I will.&quot; Most significant is in Act 5, Scene 1, where the incident involving Clarence&#x27;s return to the Lancastrian side is completely different from the text found in the &quot;Folio&quot;, and is taken entirely from the octavo text of &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York&quot; (1595).
** Several lines are spoken by characters other than who speak in the &quot;Folio&quot; text, particularly in relation to Clarence. For example, in 2.1, it is Clarence who says Edward&#x27;s &quot;I wonder how our princely father scaped,/Or whether he be scaped away or no/From Clifford and Northumberland&#x27;s pursuit.&quot; Clarence also speaks Richard&#x27;s &quot;Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,/Not separated with the racking clouds/But severed in a pale clear-shining sky,&quot; Edward&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon/Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay,&quot; and Richard&#x27;s &quot;Great lord of Warwick, if we should recount/Our baleful news, and at each word&#x27;s deliverance/Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,/The words would add more anguish than the wounds.&quot;
** The presentation of the character of Montague also differs from the &quot;Folio&quot; text. Montague is not present in 1.1, and as such, his lines are either spoken by Clarence or omitted. He is introduced in 1.2, but with some notable changes to the text; when York is giving his men instructions, his order to Montague, &quot;Brother, thou shalt to London presently&quot; (l.36) is changed to &quot;Cousin, thou shalt to London presently,&quot; York&#x27;s reiteration of the order &quot;My brother Montague shall post to London&quot; (l.54) is changed to &quot;Hast you to London my cousin Montague,&quot; and Montague&#x27;s &quot;Brother, I go, I&#x27;ll win them, fear it not&quot; (l.60) is changed to &quot;Cousin, I go, I&#x27;ll win them, fear it not.&quot; Additionally, the report of the death of Warwick and Montague&#x27;s brother Thomas Neville in 2.3 is different from the text; &quot;son&quot; in line 15 is replaced with &quot;father,&quot; &quot;brother&quot; in line 19 is replaced with &quot;son&quot; and &quot;gentleman&quot; in line 23 is replaced with &quot;Salisbury.&quot;
** The character of Elizabeth&#x27;s son, the Marquess of Dorset, is introduced just after the marriage of Elizabeth and Edward (4.1). In the text, Dorset does not appear until &quot;Richard III&quot;.
* The Tragedy of Richard III
** Of the 3,887 lines comprising the &quot;First Folio&quot; text of the play, Howell cut only 72; roughly 1.8% of the total. Some of these lines include Richard&#x27;s reference in 1.3 to Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s family fighting for the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses (ll.127–130). Also absent is Margaret warning Dorset that he is only recently made a noble and doesn&#x27;t yet fully understand the value of his role, Richard telling Dorset that this is good council, and the subsequent discussion between Richard and Margaret about eyries (ll.254–272). In 2.1, Edward&#x27;s reference to &quot;the precious image of our dear Redeemer&quot; is absent (l.122). In 3.1, Richard&#x27;s comparison of himself to &quot;the formal Vice Iniquity&quot; is absent (ll.82–83), as is his instruction to Buckingham in 3.5 to tell the people that Edward once put someone to death for saying he would make his son &quot;heir to the Crown, meaning, indeed, his house&quot; (ll.74–77). Absent from 4.4 is Elizabeth&#x27;s accusation that Richard is using the crown to hide his murder of her two sons (ll.134–137) and Richard&#x27;s subsequent references to &quot;Humphrey Hower&quot; (ll.166–168). Sir Christopher&#x27;s list of nobles fighting for Richard is absent from 4.5 (ll.11–15), as is Stanley&#x27;s list of the nobles who have died during the battle from 5.7 (ll.12–15)
** The character of Lord Grey is not portrayed as Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s son, but simply as a kinsman; only Dorset is her son. In the text, although there is some confusion and overlapping regarding the two characters in the early scenes, in the latter half of the play, they are both depicted as her sons.
** After the murder of Clarence, Sir Richard Ratcliffe is revealed to have been watching the entire time from a balcony overlooking the room. As the murderer disposes of the body, Ratcliffe quietly leaves.
** Jane Shore is present in 3.2; when Catesby comes to see Hastings, Shore comes out of Hastings&#x27; house as he prepares himself to meet with Stanley. In the play, Shore is mentioned as the mistress of Edward IV and Hastings, but never appears on-stage.
** Lovell and Ratcliffe are present throughout 4.1; listening to Lady Anne, the Duchess of Gloucester and Queen Elizabeth lamenting the fact that Richard has been made king.
** Dorset is present as a member of Richmond&#x27;s council from 5.2 onwards; in the text, Dorset is not seen after he leaves England. In 5.2, Dorset speaks the lines assigned to the Earl of Oxford/Second Lord.
** Just prior to the appearance of the ghosts in 5.4, the Duchess of Gloucester&#x27;s lines where she promises to pray for Richard&#x27;s enemies and hopes that the spirits of those he has murdered haunts him (4.4.180–185) are repeated in voiceover.
** The play ends differently from the text. After Richmond is finished speaking, the camera moves away and begins to pan across a huge pyramid of bodies. Off-camera, a woman can be heard laughing. Eventually, the camera moves up the pyramid, and sitting atop, cradling Richard&#x27;s body is Margaret.
* The Comedy of Errors
** Some minor lines are omitted from various scenes; most of the discussion between Antipholus (S) and Dromio (S) regarding Father Time and baldness (2.2.75–109); Luciana&#x27;s report of what Dromio (E) told her as to why Antipholus (E) would not come home to dinner (2.2.-160-162); Dromio (S)&#x27;s &quot;Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold./It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold&quot; (3.1.72–73); the argument between Dromio (S), Dromio (E) and Antipholus (E) about birds without feathers and fish without fins (3.1.79–84); Antipholus (E)&#x27;s denial that he is having an affair with the Courtesan (3.1.112–114); the reference to &quot;America, the Indies&quot; during the discussion regarding Nell (3.2.136–140); several lines are omitted from Adriana&#x27;s appeal to the Duke in 5.1 (ll.146–147, ll.150–152 and l.158); Antipholus (E)&#x27;s description of Pinch (5.1.238–240); Aegeon&#x27;s &quot;Though now this grain&#x27;d face of mine be hid/In sap-consuming winter&#x27;s drizzled snow&quot; (5.1.312–313)
** At various points in the production, Aegeon wanders listlessly around the set, unlike the play, where he appears in the opening and closing scene only. In the production, he appears at the start of 3.1, 4.1, 4.3 and 5.1.
** A small scene is added between 3.2 and 4.1 where Antipholus (S) is standing on his balcony and sees Antipholus (E) wandering in the marketplace. However, he rubs his eyes, looks at his glass of wine and dismisses what he has seen.
* The Two Gentlemen of Verona
** 1.1 begins with Mercatio and Eglamour attempting to formally woo Julia; Mercatio by showing her a coffer overflowing with gold coins, Eglamour by displaying a parchment detailing his family history (there is no dialogue in this scene).
** The capture of Silvia and the flight of Eglamour is seen, as opposed to merely being described.
** Eglamour is also present at the end of 5.4 (once again without any dialogue).
* Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost
** A large number of lines are cut from every scene in the play. Some of the more notable omissions include, from 1.1, Longaville&#x27;s &quot;Fat paunches have lean pats, and dainty bits/Make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits&quot; (ll.26–27); Berowne&#x27;s &quot;study is like the heaven&#x27;s glorious sun,/That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks;/Small have continual plodders ever won,/Save base authority from others&#x27; books&quot; (ll.84–87); the discussion between the Berowne and the others regarding corn, geese and Spring (ll.96–109); Berowne&#x27;s condemnation of study, &quot;while it doth study to have what it would,/It doth forget to do the thing it should;/And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,/&#x27;Tis won as towns with fire – so won, so lost&quot; (ll.142–145); some of the dialogue discussing Armado and the initial dialogue upon the arrival of Costard and Dull (ll.176–188); and the dialogue between Berowne and Costard which ends the scene (ll.293–302). Absent from 1.2 is most of the discussion between Moth and Armado as to how Armado may get three years&#x27; worth of study into an hour (ll.33–55); the discussion between Moth and Armado regarding the four complexions (ll.83–111); and Armado&#x27;s references to duelling in his soliloquy (ll.169–171). Absent from 2.1 is the second set of word play between Berowne and Rosaline (ll.178–191); and most of the conversation between Boyet and Longaville (ll.198–206). Absent from 3.1 is most of the opening conversation between Moth and Armado regarding love (ll.6–49). Absent from 4.1 is most of the conversation between the Princess and the Forester regarding the deer (ll.11–41); the concluding lines of Armado&#x27;s letter to Jaquenetta, &quot;Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar/&#x27;Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey./Submissive fall his princely feet before,/And he from forage will incline to play./But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?/Food for his rage, repasture for his den&quot; (ll.87–92); the discussion between Boyet, Maria and Costard about aiming (ll.128–140); and most of Costard&#x27;s closing soliloquy (ll.143–148). Absent from 4.2 is some of the dialogue between Costard and Holofernes (ll.80–88). 4.3 is especially heavily cut, with some of the absences including the opening few lines from Berowne&#x27;s soliloquy (ll.1–7), his initial aside upon the arrival of the King, &quot;Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid. Thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the left pap. In faith, secrets&quot; (ll.21–23); most of the King&#x27;s sonnet (ll.31–41); most of Berowne and the King&#x27;s asides upon the arrival of Longaville (ll.45–53); most of Berowne, the King and Longaville&#x27;s asides upon the arrival of Dumaine (ll.77–89); most of Berowne&#x27;s argument that Rosaline is the most beautiful of the ladies (ll.231–242); and Berowne&#x27;s closing lines after the others have left (ll.356–361). Absent from 5.1 is the conversation where Moth gets the intellectual and linguistic better of Holofernes (ll.37–76). Also absent from 5.1 is most of Costard&#x27;s speech in which he uses the word &quot;honorificabilitudinitatibus&quot; (ll.39–42). Absent from 5.2 is Boyet&#x27;s report of Moth&#x27;s rehearsing for the masque (ll.97–118); some of the mockery of Moth when he tries to recite his lines (ll.166–174); most of the dialogue between the King and Rosaline disguised as the Princess (ll.219–226); some of Berowne&#x27;s explanation as to how the ladies knew what the men were up to (ll.462–467 and ll.474–481); the conversation regarding how many Worthies there are supposed to be (ll.485–505); and some of the insults shouted at Holofernes (ll.607–611).
** 1.1 and 1.2 are intercut. 1.1. runs to line 175, and then cuts to 1.2, which runs to line 118. At that point, 1.1 picks up at line 189, running to the end, where 1.2 picks up at line 121. The intercutting is structured so as Costard and Dull&#x27;s exit from the King in 1.1. is followed immediately by their arrival at Armado&#x27;s in 1.2.
** An &#x27;invented&#x27; scene is added between 2.1 and 3.1. In this scene, we see Berowne drafting the poem which is later read by Nathaniel. The lines he writes in the scene (which are heard in voiceover) are taken from the fifth poem of the William Jaggard publication &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot;; itself a variant of the final version of Berowne&#x27;s own poem.
** Moth is portrayed by an adult actor in the production, whereas in the play, there are multiple references to him being a child.
* Titus Andronicus
** Some minor lines are omitted from various scenes, such as Lavinia&#x27;s &quot;Ay, for these slips have made him noted long&quot; (2.3.87), Titus&#x27; &quot;Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,/To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o&#x27;er,/How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?&quot; (3.2.26–28), Marcus&#x27; &quot;What, what! The lustful sons of Tamora/Performers of this heinous, bloody deed&quot; (4.1.78–79), and Titus and Marcus&#x27; brief conversation about Taurus and Aries (4.3.68–75).
** Several lines from the Q1 text which were removed in subsequent editions are used; at 1.1.35 Titus&#x27; &quot;bearing his valiant sons/in coffins from the field&quot; continues with &quot;and at this day,/To the Monument of that Andronicy/Done sacrifice of expiation,/And slaine the Noblest prisoner of the Gothes.&quot; These lines work in tandem with a rearrangement of the opening scenes to avoid a continuity problem. The lines concern the sacrifice of Alarbus, which has not yet happened in the text. However, Howell got around this problem by beginning the play at 1.1.64 – the entrance of Titus. Then, at 1.1.168, after the sacrifice of Alarbus, lines 1.1.1 to 1.1.63 (the introductions of Bassianus and Saturninus) take place, thus Titus&#x27; reference to Alarbus&#x27; sacrifice makes chronological sense.
** The character of Young Lucius is a much more important figure in the adaptation than in the play; he is present throughout Act 1, he retrieves the murder weapon after the death of Mutius; it is his knife which Titus uses to kill the fly; he aids in the capture of Chiron and Demetrius; he is present throughout the final scene.
** Also changed is the fate of Aaron&#x27;s baby, who is seen dead in a coffin in the final scene. In the play, and most productions, it is implied that the child lives.

<text>Sound Blaster is a family of sound cards and audio peripherals designed by Creative Technology/Creative Labs of Singapore. The first Sound Blaster card was introduced in 1989.

Sound Blaster sound cards were the de facto standard for consumer audio on the IBM PC compatible platform until the widespread transition to Microsoft Windows 95 and the integration of commoditized audio electronics in PCs. Windows 95 standardized the programming interface at the application level and thereby eliminated the importance of backward compatibility with Sound Blaster cards.

By 1995, Sound Blaster cards had sold over 15 million units worldwide and accounted for seven out of ten sound card sales. To date, Sound Blaster has sold over 400 million units, and their current product lineup includes USB-powered DACs as well as other audio adapters.

==Creative Music System and Game Blaster==

===Creative Music System===
The history of Creative sound cards started with the release of the Creative Music System (&quot;C/MS&quot;) CT-1300 board in August 1987. It contained two Philips SAA1099 integrated circuits, which, together, provided 12 channels of square-wave &quot;bee-in-a-box&quot; stereo sound, four channels of which can be used for noise.

These ICs were featured earlier in various popular electronics magazines around the world. For many years Creative tended to use off-the-shelf components and manufacturers&#x27; reference designs for their early products. The various integrated circuits had white or black paper stickers fully covering their tops to hide their identities. On the C/MS board in particular, the Philips chips had white pieces of paper with a fictitious &quot;CMS-301&quot; inscription on them. Real Creative parts usually had consistent CT &quot;number&quot; references.

Surprisingly, the board also contained a large 40-pin DIP integrated circuit bearing a &quot;CT 1302A CTPL 8708&quot; (Creative Technology Programmable Logic) serigraphed inscription and looking exactly like the DSP of the later Sound Blaster. Software, including Creative&#x27;s own, use this chip to automatically detect the card (by trying certain register reads and writes).

===Game Blaster===

A year later, in 1988, Creative marketed the C/MS via Radio Shack under the name Game Blaster. This card was identical in every way to the precursor C/MS hardware. Whereas the C/MS package came with five floppy disks full of utilities and song files, Creative supplied only a single floppy with the basic utilities and game patches to allow Sierra Online&#x27;s games using the Sierra Creative Interpreter engine to play music with the card and it also included a later revision of the game Silpheed that added C/MS support.

===Clone===
In 2017 hobbyists developed a clone CT1300 PCB.

==First generation Sound Blasters, 8-bit ISA &amp; MCA cards==

===Sound Blaster 1.0, CT1310, CT1320A, CT1320B===
The Sound Blaster 1.0 (code named &quot;Killer Kard&quot;), CT1320A, was released in 1989. In addition to Game Blaster features, it has a 9-voice (11 voices in drum mode) FM synthesizer using the Yamaha YM3812 chip, also known as OPL2. It provided compatibility with the market leader AdLib sound card, which had gained support in PC games in the preceding year. Creative used the &quot;DSP&quot; acronym to designate the digital audio part of the Sound Blaster. This stood for Digital Sound Processor, rather than the more common digital signal processor, and is a simple microcontroller from the Intel MCS-51 family (supplied by Intel and Matra MHS, among others). It can play back 8-bit monaural sampled sound at up to 23 kHz sampling frequency and record 8-bit at up to 12 kHz. The sole DSP-like features of the circuit are ADPCM decompression and a primitive non-MPU-401-compatible MIDI interface. The ADPCM decompression schemes supported are 2 to 1, 3 to 1 and 4 to 1. The CT1320B variety of the Sound Blaster 1.0 typically has C/MS chips installed in sockets rather than soldered on the PCB, though units do exist with the C/MS chips soldered on.

Some sources note that the original Sound Blaster 1.0 was produced under the CT1310 number. This however is a topic of ongoing debate. Creative refers to CT1310 for the Sound Blaster 1.0 on its website.

In less than a year, the Sound Blaster became the top-selling expansion card for the PC. It achieved this by providing an AdLib-compatible product, with additional features, for the same, and often lower, price. The inclusion of a game port was important to its early success. PCs of this era did not include a game port. Game port cards were costly (around US$50) and used one of the few expansion slots PCs had at the time. Given the choice between an AdLib card or a fully-compatible Sound Blaster card that came with a game port, saved a slot, and included the &quot;DSP&quot; for not much more in price, many consumers opted for the Sound Blaster. In-game support for the digital portion of the card did not happen until after the Sound Blaster had gained dominance.

When Microsoft announced Multimedia PC (MPC) in November 1990, it suggested to developers that they use the Sound Blaster as it was the only sound card that came close to complying with the MPC standard. The press speculated that Microsoft based the MPC standard on the Sound Blaster&#x27;s specifications. By 1993 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wondered &quot;why would a gamer&quot; buy a competing AdLib card that was not Sound Blaster-compatible. Creative advertised the Sound Blaster 16 (&quot;the 16-bit sound standard&quot;) with the slogan &quot;Get Real&quot;, emphasizing its &quot;real 100% Sound Blaster compatibility&quot; and rhetorically asking &quot;why those other manufacturers spend so much time comparing themselves to Sound Blaster&quot;.

====Reception====
&quot;Compute!&quot; in 1989 stated that with Sound Blaster, &quot;IBM-compatible computers have taken the lead in sound and music for personal computers&quot;. Naming it a Compute! Choice, the magazine described the quality of the opening music of &quot;Space Quest III&quot; with the card as &quot;extraordinary&quot;, praising the quality compared to the Roland MT-32 and Ad Lib versions. &quot;Compute!&quot; approved of the card&#x27;s DMA and Creative&#x27;s dissemination of technical information, and concluded that while the more-expensive MT-32 was superior, Sound Blaster&#x27;s audio quality was better than that of Ad Lib or Game Blaster.

===Sound Blaster 1.5, CT1320C, CT1320U===
Released in 1990, the Sound Blaster 1.5, CT1320C, dropped the C/MS chips, which were no longer popular with game developers. Instead, the board had two empty sockets, which could be user upgraded by purchasing the C/MS chips directly from Creative or Phillips SAA-1099s from another source. Otherwise the card functions identically to the Sound Blaster 1.0. The CT1320U variety has the same layout as the CT1320C.

===Sound Blaster 2.0, CT1350===
The final revision of the original Sound Blaster, the Sound Blaster 2.0 was released in October 1991, CT1350, added support for &quot;auto-init&quot; DMA, which assisted in producing a continuous loop of double-buffered sound output. Similar to version 1.0 and 1.5, it used a 1-channel 8-bit DAC. However, the maximum sampling rate was increased to 44 kHz for playback, and 15 kHz for record. The DSP&#x27;s MIDI UART was upgraded to full-duplex and offered time stamping features, but was not yet compatible with the MPU-401 interface used by professional MIDI equipment. The Sound Blaster 2.0&#x27;s PCB-layout used more highly integrated components, both shrinking the board&#x27;s size and reducing manufacturing cost.

Owners of previous revision Sound Blaster boards could upgrade their board by purchasing the V2.00 DSP chip from Creative Labs, and swapping the older DSP V1.0x with the newer replacement. The upgraded board gained the auto-init DMA and new MIDI capabilities of the Sound Blaster 2.0 but not the expanded sampling rates. The upgrade was necessary for full compatibility with the Windows 3.0 Multimedia Extensions upgrade.

===Sound Blaster MCV, CT5320===
Sound Blaster MCV, CT5320, was a version created for IBM PS/2 Model 50 and higher and their ISA-incompatible Micro Channel architecture. The MCV Sound Blaster has some issues outputting audio while running on PS/2s with CPUs running faster than 16 MHz. However, the joystick interface is still inoperable on PS/2s it was designed for due to the slow-speed Schottky chips that have been installed. None of these timing issues affect the Yamaha YM3812. Some of the MCV Sound Blasters were released with faster Schottkys which eradicated some of the problems.

==Second-generation Sound Blasters, 16-bit ISA &amp; MCA cards==
===Sound Blaster Pro, CT1330===
Model CT1330, announced in May 1991, was the first significant redesign of the card&#x27;s core features, and complied with the Microsoft MPC standard.. The Sound Blaster Pro supported faster digital input and output sampling rates (up to 22.05 kHz stereo or 44.1 kHz mono), added a &quot;mixer&quot; to provide a crude master volume control (independent of the volume of sound sources feeding the mixer), and a crude high pass or low pass filter. The Sound Blaster Pro used a pair of YM3812 chips to provide stereo music-synthesis (one for each channel). The Sound Blaster Pro was fully backward compatible with the original Sound Blaster line, and by extension, the AdLib sound card. The Sound Blaster Pro was the first Creative sound card to have a built-in CD-ROM interface. Most Sound Blaster Pro cards featured a proprietary interface for a Panasonic (Matsushita MKE) drive. The Sound Blaster Pro cards are basically 8-bit ISA cards, they use only the lower 8 data bits of the ISA bus. While at first glance it appears to be a 16-bit ISA card, it does not have &#x27;fingers&#x27; for data transfer on the higher &quot;AT&quot; portion of the bus connector. It uses the 16-bit extension to the ISA bus to provide the user with an additional choice for an IRQ (10) and DMA (0)m channel only found on the 16-bit portion of the edge connector.

A short lived joint developed project between Creative and Tandy resulted in the Creative/Tandy Multimedia Sound Adapter, 849–3030. This Sound Blaster Pro derived card was factory installed in Tandy Multimedia PCs. It combined the CT1330 with Tandy joystick and MIDI ports (not MPU-401 compatible).

===Sound Blaster Pro 2, CT1600===
The revised version, the Sound Blaster Pro 2, CT1600, replaced the YM3812s with a more advanced Yamaha YMF262 (&quot;OPL3&quot;). Otherwise it is functionally identical to the original Sound Blaster Pro. Shortly after the release of the Sound Blaster Pro 2 version, Creative discontinued the original Sound Blaster Pro.

The Sound Blaster Pro 2 was also sold with the following on-board CD-ROM controllers:
*Sound Blaster Pro 2, SCSI, CT1610
*Sound Blaster Pro 2, LMSI, CT1620
*Sound Blaster Pro 2, Sony, CT1690
*Sound Blaster Pro 2, Mitsumi, CT2600

Packaged Sound Blaster cards were initially marketed and sold into the retail-channel. Creative&#x27;s domination of the PC audio card business soon had them selling the Sound Blaster Pro 2 OEM, CT1680, to customers for integration into pre-assembled PCs.

Creative also sold Multimedia Upgrade Kits containing the Sound Blaster Pro. The kit bundled the sound card, a Matsushita CD-ROM drive (model 531 for single-speed, or 562/3 for the later double-speed (2x) drives), and several CD-ROMs of multimedia software titles. As CD-ROM technology was new, the kit included CD-ROM software, representing a very good value to customers. One such kit, named &quot;OmniCD&quot;, included the 2x Matsushita drive along with an ISA controller card and software, including Software Toolworks Encyclopedia and Aldus PhotoStyler SE. It was compliant with the MPC Level 2 standard.

===Sound Blaster Pro 2 MCV, CT5330===
The Sound Blaster Pro 2 MCV, CT5330, was a version created for IBM PS/2 model 50 and higher and their MicroChannel bus. 

==Third generation Sound Blasters, 16-bit ISA cards==

===Sound Blaster 16===

The next model, the Sound Blaster 16, announced in June 1992, introduced:
*16-bit CD-quality digital audio;
*An MPU-401 compatible UART via game port;
*A connector for the Wave Blaster, a &#x27;Wavetable&#x27; daughterboard.
Eventually this design proved so popular that Creative made a PCI version of this card. Creative&#x27;s audio revenue grew from $40 million per year to nearly $1 billion following the launch of the Sound Blaster 16 and related products. Rich Sorkin was General Manager of the global business during this time, responsible for product planning, product management, marketing and OEM sales. Moving the card off the ISA bus, which was already approaching obsolescence, meant that no line for host-controlled ISA DMA was available, because the PCI slot offers no such line. Instead, the card used PCI bus mastering to transfer data from the main memory to the D/A converters. Since existing DOS programs expected to be able to initiate host-controlled ISA DMA for producing sound, backward compatibility with the older Sound Blaster cards for DOS programs required a software driver work-around; since this work-around necessarily depended on the virtual 8086 mode of the PC&#x27;s CPU in order to catch and reroute accesses from the ISA DMA controller to the card itself, it failed for a number of DOS games that either were not fully compatible with this CPU mode or needed so much free conventional memory that they could not be loaded with the driver occupying part of this memory. In Microsoft Windows, there was no problem, as Creative&#x27;s Windows driver software could handle both ISA and PCI cards correctly.

===Sound Blaster ViBRA16===

The Sound Blaster ViBRA16 was an inexpensive single-chip implementation of the Sound Blaster 16 for the OEM market. Creative Labs also used this chip for the Sound Blaster 32, Phone Blaster and Phone Blaster 28.8 (VIBRA plus modem, CT3120 and CT3220.) and many other value-edition cards. External Yamaha OPL3 FM music synthesis was retained in earlier boards built around the ViBRA16 or ViBRA16s controllers, whilst the later (and more common) ViBRA16 boards used CQM (Creative Quadratic Modulation) developed by E-mu Systems. This series included the ViBRA16 (CT2501), ViBRA16s (CT2502, CT2504), ViBRA16c (CT2505) PnP and ViBRA16XV (CT2511) chips. The primary advantage of the ViBRA16 was the inclusion of a 14.4 kbit/s telephony Modem; it also functioned as a telephone.

==Fourth generation Sound Blasters, 16-bit ISA cards, dynamic sample-based synthesis==

===Sound Blaster AWE32===

Released in March 1994, the &quot;Sound Blaster AWE32 (Advanced WavEffects)&quot; introduced an all new MIDI synthesizer section based on the EMU8000. The &quot;AWE32&quot; consisted of two distinct audio sections; the Creative digital audio section (audio codec, optional CSP/ASP chip socket, Yamaha OPL3), and the E-mu MIDI synthesizer section. The synthesizer section consisted of the EMU8000 sampler and effects processor, an EMU8011 1 MB sample ROM, and 512 KB of sample RAM (expandable to 28 MB). To fit the new hardware, the AWE32 was a full-length ISA card, measuring .

===Sound Blaster 32===
A derivative of the AWE32 design, the &quot;Sound Blaster 32&quot; (SB32) was a value-oriented offering from Creative. Announced on June 6, 1995, the SB32 became the new entry-level card in the AWE32 product-line (previously held by the &quot;AWE32 Value&quot;.) The SB32 retained the AWE32&#x27;s EMU8000/EMU8011 MIDI-synthesis engine and built-in instrument ROM, but dropped the onboard RAM, the Wave Blaster header, and the CSP port. The SB32 used the &quot;Vibra&quot; chip to reduce component count, which meant bass/treble/gain control was limited compared to the AWE32. The loss of onboard RAM is offset by the inclusion of 30-pin SIMM RAM sockets, which allow up to 28 MB RAM to be installed and used by the EMU engine.

===Sound Blaster AWE64===

The AWE32&#x27;s successor, the &quot;Sound Blaster AWE64&quot; (November 1996), was significantly smaller, being a &quot;half-length ISA card&quot; (that term is misleading—see the pictures for size comparison). It offered similar features to the AWE32, but also had a few notable improvements, including support for greater polyphony, although this was a product of 32 extra software-emulated channels (the additional channels could also be obtained on AWE32 hardware by using the AWE64&#x27;s driver software). The 30-pin SIMM slots from AWE32/SB32 were replaced with a proprietary memory format which could be (expensively) purchased from Creative.

The main improvements were better compatibility with older SB models, and an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The AWE64 came in two versions: A standard version (later rebranded as &quot;Value&quot;) with 512KB of RAM and a Gold version with 4 MB of RAM and a separate S/PDIF output.

==Fifth generation Sound Blasters, PCI cards, multi-channel and F/X==

===Ensoniq AudioPCI-based cards===

In 1998, Creative acquired Ensoniq Corporation, manufacturer of the AudioPCI, a card popular with OEMs at the time. It was a full-featured solution with wavetable MIDI (sample-based synthesizer), 4-speaker DirectSound3D surround sound, A3D emulation, and DOS legacy support via a terminate-and-stay-resident program. It was cheap due to lack of hardware acceleration. It is full-duplex but at least in MS Windows cannot play back several sources at once.

Creative released many cards using the original AudioPCI chip, Ensoniq ES1370, and several boards using revised versions of this chip (ES1371 and ES1373), and some with Creative-labeled AudioPCI chips. Boards using AudioPCI tech are usually easily identifiable by the board design and the chip size because they all look quite similar. Such boards include Sound Blaster PCI64 (April 1998), PCI128 (July 1998), Creative Ensoniq AudioPCI, Vibra PCI and Sound Blaster 16 PCI.

An ES137x chip contains three stereo sample rate converters, some buffers and a PCI busmaster interface. Analogue interfacing is done by a codec chip, which runs at a fixed sampling frequency of 44 (Ensoniq Audio PCI) or 48 kHz (Creative&#x27;s versions). (ISA soundcards had not resampled but switched between different time bases.) ES137x do not support SoundFonts but a filter-less MIDI engine with wavetable (sample table) sets of 2, 4, and 8MB size.

===Sound Blaster Live!===

When the &quot;Sound Blaster Live!&quot; was introduced in August 1998, the use of a programmable digital signal processor in PC-audio was not unprecedented, as IBM had already done that with cheap Mwave sound- and modem-cards and Turtle Beach with their professional Hurricane soundcards.

The Live! was built around Creative&#x27;s new EMU10K1 chip, which contained 2.44 million transistors and was advertised of processing a flashy 1,000 MIPS. The EMU10K1 (and its successors) did not use on-card RAM/ROM storage for instrument samples, instead it used a PCI busmaster interface to access sample-data stored in the host-PC&#x27;s system memory. A/D- and D/A- converters as well as analogue mixing is done by an AC&#x27;97 chip running at 48 kHz sampling rate. All members of the SB Live! family have at least four-channel analog audio outputs and a 15-pin MIDI/Joystick multiport.

For game titles, &quot;EAX&quot; 1.0 (and later 2.0) (environmental audio extensions, which briefly competed with the now defunct A3D 2.0) added hardware-accelerated acoustic effects. The EMU10K1 provided high-quality 64-voice sample-based synthesizer (marketed as &quot;Wavetable&quot;), with self-produced or third-party customized patches or &quot;Soundfonts&quot;, and the ability to resample the audio output as input and apply a range of real-time DSP effects to any set of audio subchannels present in the device.

The first model and flagship of the SB/Live family was the &quot;SB Live! Gold&quot;. Featuring gold tracings on all major analog traces and external sockets, an EMI-suppressing printed circuit board substrate and lacquer, the Gold came standard with a daughterboard that implemented a separate 4-channel alternative mini-DIN digital output to Creative-branded internal-DAC speaker sets, a S/P-DIF digital audio Input and Output with separate software mappings, and a fully decoded MIDI interface with separate Input and Output (along with on mini-DIN converter.) The Gold highlighted many features aimed at music composition; ease-of-use (plug-and-play for musicians), real-time loopback-recording of the MIDI-synthesizer (with full freedom of Soundfonts, and environmental effects such as reverb, etc.), and bundled MIDI-software.

The mainstream model was the &quot;Sound Blaster Live!&quot; Like the Gold, the Live featured multi-speaker analog output (up to four channels), and identical music/sound generation capabilities (without the bundled MIDI software and interfacing-equipment.)

Later versions of the Live!, usually called &quot;Live! 5.1&quot;, offered 5.1-channel support which adds a center channel speaker and LFE subwoofer output, most useful for movie watching. The Live! 5.1 could also use one of the 3.5 mm jack ports as an SPDIF out, which allowed the connection of an external decoder.

Creative also released a &quot;Sound Blaster Live! Player 1024&quot; edition, which is identical to the regular &quot;Sound Blaster Live!&quot;, but with the addition of some extra software.

===Sound Blaster PCI 512===
The &quot;Sound Blaster PCI 512&quot; (CT4790) is an EMU10K1-based sound card designed to fill a lower cost segment than the Live! Value. It is capable of most of the Live! Value&#x27;s features aside from being limited to 512 MIDI voice polyphony (a software-based limitation), lacking digital I/O, removal of expansion headers, and only stereo or quadraphonic output support. The card&#x27;s circuit layout is somewhat simpler than that of the Live! series.

===Sound Blaster Audigy===

The &quot;Sound Blaster Audigy&quot; (August 2001) featured the Audigy processor (EMU10K2), an improved version of the EMU10K1 processor that shipped with the &quot;Sound Blaster Live!&quot;. The Audigy could process up to four EAX environments simultaneously with its upgraded on-chip DSP and native EAX 3.0 ADVANCED HD support, and supported up to 5.1-channel output.

The Audigy was controversially advertised as a 24-bit sound card. The EMU10K2&#x27;s audio transport (DMA engine) was fixed at 16-bit sample precision at 48 kHz (like the EMU10K1 in the original Live!), and all audio had to be resampled to 48 kHz in order to be accepted by the DSP (for recording or rendering to output.)

&quot;Sound Blaster Audigy 2&quot; (September 2002) featured an updated EMU10K2 processor, sometimes referred to as EMU10K2.5, with an improved DMA engine capable of 24-bit precision. Up to 192 kHz was supported for stereo playback/record, while 6.1 was capped at 96 kHz. In addition, Audigy 2 supported up to 6.1 (later 7.1) speakers and had improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over the Audigy (106 vs. 100 decibels (A)). It also featured built-in Dolby Digital EX 6.1 and 7.1 decoding for improved DVD play-back. The Audigy 2 line were the first sound cards to receive THX certification.

&quot;Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS&quot; (September 2003) is essentially an Audigy 2 with updated DAC and op-amps. Audigy 2 ZS uses the Cirrus Logic CS4382 DAC together with the op-amps and can produce an output SNR of 108 dB. There were a few slight printed circuit board modifications and 7.1 audio support was added.

&quot;Sound Blaster Audigy 4 Pro&quot; (November 2004) was an Audigy 2 ZS with updated DACs and ADCs, the new DAC being the Cirrus Logic CS4398, boosting the output SNR to 113 dB. Other than a breakout box, it has no distinguishable difference from the Audigy 2 ZS. The DSP is identical to the Audigy 2 ZS&#x27;s but Creative put an &quot;Audigy 4&quot; sticker to cover the chip, making it appear as if it is a new chip. The Audigy 4 Pro is not to be confused with the Audigy 4 (Value) which contains lower quality DACs and does not have golden plated jacks. The Audigy 4 (Value) is more in line with the Audigy 2 Value series. The Audigy 4 had a shorter life span than its predecessors, due to the short window between it and the next-generation Sound Blaster X-Fi.

&quot;Sound Blaster Audigy Rx&quot; (September 2013) is similar to the &quot;Audigy 4&quot; but with a dedicated 600-ohm headphone amplifier and a PCIe 1x interface.

&quot;Sound Blaster Audigy Fx&quot; (September 2013) also features a 600-ohm amplifier and a PCIe interface, but lacks the EMU10K DSP.

===Sound Blaster X-Fi===

The &quot;X-Fi&quot; (for &quot;Extreme Fidelity&quot;) was released in August 2005 and came in &quot;XtremeGamer&quot;, &quot;Titanium&quot;, &quot;Titanium Fatal1ty Professional&quot;, &quot;Titanium Fatal1ty Champion&quot; and &quot;Elite Pro&quot; configurations. The 130 nm EMU20K1 (or EMU20K2 for Titanium series models) audio chip operates at 400 MHz and has 51 million transistors. The computational power of this processor, i.e. its performance, is estimated as 10,000 MIPS, which is about 24 times higher than the estimated performance of its predecessor, the Audigy processor. Beginning with the 2008 Titanium models, newer X-Fi cards switched from PCI to PCI Express x1 connectors. With the X-Fi&#x27;s &quot;Active Modal Architecture&quot; (AMA), the user can choose one of three optimization modes: Gaming, Entertainment, and Creation; each enabling a combination of the features of the chipset. The X-Fi uses EAX 5.0 which supports up to 128 3D-positioned voices with up to four effects applied to each. This release also included the 24-bit crystallizer, which is intended to pronounce percussion elements by placing some emphasis on low and high pitched parts of the sound. The X-Fi, at its release, offered some of the most powerful mixing capabilities available, making it a powerful entry-level card for home musicians. The other big improvement in the X-Fi over the previous Audigy designs was the complete overhaul of the resampling engine on the card. The previous Audigy cards had their DSPs locked at 48/16, meaning any content that did not match was resampled on the card in hardware; which was done poorly and resulted in a lot of intermodulation distortion. Many hardcore users worked around this by means of resampling their content using high quality software decoders, usually in the form of a plugin in their media player. Creative completely re-wrote the resampling method used on the X-Fi and dedicated more than half of the power of the DSP to the process; resulting in a very clean resample.

==Sixth generation Sound Blaster &quot;Sound Core3D&quot; cards==
===Sound Blaster Recon3D===
The Recon3D series was announced in September 2011 and includes the &quot;Recon3D PCIe&quot;, &quot;Recon3D Fatal1ty Professional&quot; and &quot;Recon3D Fatal1ty Champion&quot;. The cards use the new integrated &quot;Sound Core3D&quot; chip, which features the &quot;Quartet DSP&quot; from the X-Fi series as well as integrated DAC, ADC and I/O interface in a 56-pin package. The Asia-only &quot;Recon3D Professional Audio&quot; is basically a &quot;Recon3D PCIe&quot; with some extra accessories such as cables.

The Recon3D series of sound cards do not support ASIO.

The Recon3D comes with a bundled software called the SBX Pro Studio. SBX Pro Studio allows users to adjust the amount of virtual Surround, Crystallizer, Bass, Smart Volume and Dialog Plus for their Recon3D sound cards. The Recon3D also has got the Crystal Voice feature that reduces the pickup of background noises like the hairdryer or vacuum cleaner when a beamforming microphone is used.

Reviews have been generally positive, but pricing and small model differences have raised questions. Especially the low and mid priced models &quot;Recon3D PCIe&quot; and &quot;Recon3D Fatal1ty Professional&quot; have only cosmetic differences, but considerable price difference: the &quot;Fatal1ty Professional&quot;, adds a beamforming microphone, some red LED lights and a metal shroud over the board, but has no real hardware improvements.

===Sound Blaster Z-Series===
The Sound Blaster Z-Series was announced in August 2012 and includes the PCI Express x1 cards, &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;Zx&quot; and &quot;ZxR&quot; which use the same &quot;Sound Core3D&quot; chip as the previous Sound Blaster Recon3D series. The Z-Series improved sound quality over the Recon3D series by including more dedicated audio hardware such as Op-Amps, DACs, and ADCs.

* The &quot;Sound Blaster Z&quot; is the baseline card of the series. Some of its main features are Cirrus Logic 116 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) digital-to-analog converters (DACs), a dedicated headphone jack with 600 ohm amplifier, and is bundled with a &quot;Beamforming Microphone&quot; that captures sound in a specific direction. One can switch between listening with headphones and desktop speakers in the Sound Blaster Z Control Panel. This card has a red color theme with a red LED light on the board. In addition to the red model, there is an OEM version that lacks the LED light, metal shielding and bundled microphone.
* The &quot;Sound Blaster Z SE&quot; released in 2021 is identical to the Z, but with 7.1 channel virtual surround for compatible headphones, no bundled microphone and no driver CD as the card is only compatible with the Sound Blaster Command software.
* The Sound Blaster Zx card is identical to the Z (exact same card, exact same card SKU/Model (SB1500) on card itself, compared side by side in store), with the only notable change compared to the baseline &quot;Z&quot; being the addition of the desktop ACM (Audio Control Module). The Zx &amp; ZxR were both bundled with the Audio Control Module (ACM) which is basically an extension cord for headphones. The ACM contains both 1/4&quot; and 3.5 mm headphone and microphone jacks, a potentiometer headphone volume knob, and a built-in dual-microphone Beamforming array. The ACM uses a red color theme that matches the card. The entire package (Card and ACM) carries a separate model number of SB1506, which is different than the base SB1500 printed on the included card (as the card is just a SB-Z now bundled with accessories).
* The &quot;Sound Blaster ZxR&quot; is the top of line sound card of the series and uses an entirely different card from the Z and Zx. Some of its features include TI Burr-Brown 124 dB SNR DACs, two swappable op-amps, a 600 ohm 80 mW TI TPA6120 headphone amplifier, and 192 kHz stereo pass through. The &quot;Sound Blaster ZxR&quot; comes with a daughter board which provides optical S/PDIF input and output, and two RCA inputs that feature a TI Burr-Brown 123 dB SNR analog-to-digital converter (ADC); it has its own &quot;Sound Core3D&quot; processor and takes up a second expansion slot in the computer if installed. The &quot;ZxR&quot; can record up to 24-bit/96 kHz. The ACM and two boards (main and daughter) have a black color scheme with no LED lighting.

===Sound BlasterX AE-5/Plus===
The Sound BlasterX AE-5 was announced in June 2017, the first discrete sound card made by Creative in five years since the introduction of the Z-series. The card is the first in the Sound Blaster series to use a 32-bit/384 kHz SABRE 32 Ultra DAC (ES9016K2M), along with a custom-designed discrete headphone amplifier (1 W output power and low output impedance of 1 Ohm so it can provide high damping factor for virtually any dynamic headphone). The card has an additional RGB lighting courtesy of a MOLEX power connection and accompanying RGB LED strip. In late 2017, a white colored model of the sound card called the Sound BlasterX AE-5 Pure Edition was released with 4 RGB LED strips instead of one with the standard black model.

In 2020, the AE-5 Plus was released which is similar to the previous model, but the sound card comes with hardware Dolby Digital Live and DTS encoding. There is a white colored Pure Edition released alongside the standard black model.

===Sound Blaster AE-7===
The Sound Blaster AE-7 was released in July 2019 alongside the Sound Blaster AE-9. It is equipped with an ESS SABRE 9018 DAC, and it features an ACM (Audio Control Module), which connects to the sound card via two of the audio ports available on the card itself. It doesn&#x27;t feature RGB lighting, contrary to the AE-5, and it doesn&#x27;t require external power either.

===Sound Blaster AE-9===
The Sound Blaster AE-9 was announced in December 2018, targeting the audiophile audience. This soundcard is equipped with an ESS SABRE 9038 DAC, and it features an external Audio Control Module which connects to the sound card with a mini-HDMI cable, containing an XLR port for a microphone and a toggleable 48+ volt phantom power rail; the sound card itself features replaceable operational amplifiers. The sound card with the external DAC consumes 75 W, and thus is the first sound card from Creative that requires auxiliary power, using a 6-pin PCI-E connector to supply power to the external DAC.
The card was officially released on July 10, 2019, to celebrate 30 years since the introduction of the original Sound Blaster.

== Sound BlasterAxx ==
Sound BlasterAxx is a series of USB powered speakers that has the features of a sound card. The speakers also have built-in microphones. The series of speakers work with Mac OS X other than Microsoft Windows.

=== Sound BlasterAxx SBX series ===
The Sound BlasterAxx SBX series was released in year 2012. There are three models in the series, the Sound BlasterAxx SBX 8, Sound BlasterAxx SBX 10 and Sound BlasterAxx SBX 20. All three speakers have a bass port, Headphone Out and Aux-in/Mic-in 3.5mm jacks behind. The speakers do not contain rechargeable batteries and they require a USB power source.

The speakers work with the Sound BlasterAxx control panel software for adjustment of SBX Pro Studio and Crystal Voice settings. The Sound BlasterAxx Control Panel has got a Mac OS X version other than the Microsoft Windows version.

The Sound BlasterAxx SBX 8 is the only speaker that does not have Bluetooth capability. The Sound BlasterAxx SBX 10 and Sound BlasterAxx SBX 20 are Bluetooth capable and can be used for answering phones calls from iOS and Android smart phones. The Bluetooth version for the speakers is Bluetooth 2.1(Enhanced Data Rate). The Bluetooth codecs supported are SBC and AAC, aptX is not supported. The speakers also do not support ASIO and do not have the Scout Mode feature.

SBX Pro Studio effects such as SBX Surround, SBX Crystallizer, SBX Bass, SBX Smart Volume and SBX Dialog Plus can be adjusted by the Sound Blaster Central mobile app.

=== Sound BlasterAxx AXX 200 ===

In the beginning of 2014, Creative Labs released the Sound BlasterAxx AXX 200 portable Bluetooth speaker.

Like the speakers of the Sound BlasterAxx SBX series, it has a built-in SB-Axx1 sound chip and works with both Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows computers. Its dimensions are 64.0 x 72.3 x 200.6 mm (2.51 x 2.84 x 7.9 inches) and it weighs 0.5 kg (1.1 lbs).

The Sound BlasterAxx AXX 200 has a built-in 5200mAh Lithium-ion battery, allowing it to be used as a portable Bluetooth speaker. It has a microSD card slot for playing WMA/MP3 tracks from a microSD card. Calls and voices can be recorded through its microphone; the recordings are stored in the microSD card. It also has a megaphone function.

Its Bluetooth version is Bluetooth 2.1(Enhanced Date Rate) and supports SBC, AAC and aptX Bluetooth codecs. It can be paired with Bluetooth devices via NFC(Near Field Communication).

Same as the Sound BlasterAxx SBX series of speakers, it does not support ASIO and does not have the Scout Mode feature.

==Connectors==

===External connector===
Sound Blaster cards since 1999 conform to Microsoft&#x27;s PC 99 standard for color-coding the external connectors as follows:
Up until the AWE line in 1994, Creative cards have short text inscriptions on the backplane of the card, indicating which port does what (i.e. Mic, Spk, Aux In, Aux Out). On later cards, the text inscriptions were changed to icons. With the latest cards from Creative, the cards were changed to use numbers as the ports are flexi-jacks and can have different functions assigned to them at run-time (i.e. changed from speaker output to mic in), but a color overlay sticker is included with retail units to help consumers identify the commonly used functions of the ports in their default modes.

===Internal pin connector and jumper===
A lot of audio/data pin connectors and jumpers-setting is present in the internal body of the sound blaster, different from card to card, and along the years of productions.

Most common pin connector:
* Audio CD-IN, CD SPDIF and AUX-In
* CD-ROM drive connection
* PC speaker
* TAD (Telephone Answering Device) connector
* MB_PRO (Modem Blaster connector)
* Wave Blaster Header

Most common pin jumper setting (especially before plug-and-play features):

* Sound Card Base Address/IRQ/DMA
* Line or Speaker output
* MIDI
* Joystick

==Driver software modification (soft mod)==

Some drivers from the Audigy 2 ZS have been soft-modded by enthusiasts. These can be installed on Creative&#x27;s older cards, including Sound Blaster Live!, Audigy, and Audigy 2. It has been claimed to offer improved sound quality, hardware acceleration of higher EAX versions in games, 64-channel mixing for Audigy 1, and an overall improvement in the card&#x27;s performance. Several forum posts across the web have reported favorable results with this technique, excepting Live! users where the drivers only add the ability to use the newer software applications (i.e. the newer mixer applet). Comments on forums from developers of the software mod have said that Live&#x27;s hardware is not capable of EAX3 nor 64-channels of hardware sound mixing.

Later, in 2004, Creative released updated drivers top-to-bottom for the Audigy through Audigy 4 line that put these cards basically at feature parity on a software level. As of 2006, the entire Audigy lineup uses the same driver package. DSP decoding at the driver level on other cards than Audigy 2 ZS and 4 is still not supported by official drivers, but it works with soft-modded drivers on the other cards with hardware DSP (like Audigy 2 6.1).

When Windows Vista was released, there was only a single beta driver for the Creative Audigy series that was usable on the operating system with minimal functionality and frequent instability reported by users. A Creative Forum activist named Daniel K. modified drivers from the X-Fi and applied it to the Audigy and Live! series, restoring most if not all of the features that came with the original XP setup CD in Vista. X-Fi drivers have noticeably better sound quality under Vista, and more bug fixes because of the newer build (last modified version is 2.15.0004EQ April). He managed to enable the X-Fi Crystallizer to work on Audigy series cards in software, however because of the patents involved, he was forced to remove all the modified drivers and DLL patch.

Creative then released a newer official Audigy Vista driver (2.18.0000 as of 28 July 2008) due to public and consumer pressure. However, some form of agreement between Creative and Daniel K has been achieved, as he returned to the Creative forums, posting updated versions of his modified drivers. He released the final version of his modded driver package as of January 12, 2012.

==Audio effects processor==
== Compatibility with Linux ==
All recent Linux distributions support Sound Blaster Cards via kernel drivers. In case of non-Plug-and-Play ISA cards, a configuration file in must be reconfigured, writing for example with Sound Blaster 16 card installed: .

X-Fi series cards have basic support in Linux, but the advanced features like signal routing, relay control or external I/O consoles are not supported.

Support for the newer Sound Blaster cards (Z and AE series) was added to the kernel during 4.19 – 4.20 release timeframe.

<text>Little Darlings is a 1980 American teen comedy-drama film starring Tatum O&#x27;Neal and Kristy McNichol and featuring Armand Assante and Matt Dillon. It was directed by Ronald F. Maxwell. The screenplay was written by Kimi Peck and Dalene Young and the original music score was composed by Charles Fox. The film was marketed with the tagline &quot;Don&#x27;t let the title fool you&quot;, a reference to a scene in which the character of Angel tells Randy, &quot;Don&#x27;t let the name fool you.&quot;

Film critic Roger Ebert said of the film that it &quot;somehow does succeed in treating the awesome and scary subject of sexual initiation with some of the dignity it deserves.&quot;

==Plot==
A group of teenage girls head to Camp Little Wolf, an all-girls camp, for the summer. The group includes Angel Bright, a cynical, streetwise girl, and Ferris Whitney, a romantic, naive rich girl. The two immediately develop a dislike for one another, and to their dismay learn they must share a cabin. Cinder Carlson, an arrogant teen model who is in the same cabin and is boastful about her sexual experiences, suggests to the group that Ferris and Angel are virgins, leading to the two girls making a bet to see which one of them can lose her virginity first. All of the girls in the camp divide into two &quot;teams&quot;, each rooting for and egging on either Ferris or Angel.

One day, the girls manage to steal one of the camp buses and use it to get condoms from the men&#x27;s room at the local gas station. On the outing, Angel meets Randy, a boy from the camp across the lake. She decides Randy is the guy she wants to lose her virginity to. Meanwhile, Ferris sets her sights on Gary Callahan, a much older camp counselor. Angel regularly sneaks out of camp to see Randy and she tries to get him drunk, while Ferris attempts to seduce Gary, but neither girl is successful in her efforts. During Parents&#x27; Day, Ferris&#x27; dad reveals that he is divorcing her mom, which leads to Ferris feeling disillusioned in her ideas of romantic love. Angel feels distressed when her mother suggests that sex is &quot;no big deal&quot;.

One night, Ferris finally tries to tell Gary how she feels. She goes to his cabin and talks about Romeo and Juliet, but Gary calmly rebuffs her, telling her he is &quot;a teacher&quot;, not &quot;a prince&quot;. Pressured by the other girls, she lies and says that she and Gary had sex. The rumors spread throughout the camp, jeopardizing Gary&#x27;s job.

Angel tries to view the act of sex with the same nonchalance as her mother, but when she has an opportunity to have sex with Randy in a boathouse, she becomes confused and hesitant. Randy is put off by Angel&#x27;s reluctance and leaves, with Angel tearfully protesting, &quot;But I &quot;like&quot; you!&quot; A few days later, she meets Randy again with a changed attitude, and they manage to consummate their relationship. However, the experience is not what Angel thought it would be like, and she does not tell the other girls that she had sex. She allows Ferris to win the bet.

The girls in the camp eventually all turn against Cinder and call her out for instigating the bet, with some of the girls arguing that it doesn&#x27;t matter who is a virgin or not. Ferris also apologizes to Gary and confesses to the camp director about her lie, saving Gary&#x27;s job. When Randy later seeks Angel out, she admits that while she likes him, she is not ready for a relationship with him. Angel and Ferris leave camp realizing they are more alike than different, and as they return home to their parents, they become best friends.

==Production==
The film was made by Stephen Friedman&#x27;s Kings Road Productions. Paramount agreed to provide $5.3 million to make it in exchange for $14.3 million to market and develop the film.

Kristy McNichol had the first pick of lead roles over Tatum O’Neal and chose the role of Angel, the more streetwise character.
Principal photography on &quot;Little Darlings&quot; began on March 19, 1979, at Hard Labor Creek State Park, 50 miles east of Atlanta. The gas station men&#x27;s room (condom) scene was filmed in downtown Rutledge, the town nearest the park. The meeting place for the buses at the beginning and ending were filmed in a parking lot near the offices of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, and the old Omni Coliseum can be seen in the background including in the last scene of the movie. When Ferris is driven into town, they pass the Swan House, indicating that her family lives in Buckhead, a wealthy part of town to the north of the city.

A novelization of the film by Sonia Pilcer was released as a tie-in in 1980.

==Reception==
The film made $34.3 million domestically against a budget of $5.3 million. The film also made $1.2 million in the ancillary markets.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a &quot;fresh&quot; approval rating of 67% based on nine reviews. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 45 out of 100 based on nine reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Frank Rich of &quot;Time&quot; praised McNichol&#x27;s acting, but criticized the script and said the characters were underdeveloped. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, “Miss O&#x27;Neal and Miss McNichol, both lovely and accomplished actresses, are much better than their material. And they go a long way toward lending the story a little charm.”Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; also criticized the tonal inconsistencies of the film, but noted that “the scenes in which [the characters] actually confront the realities of sex are handled so thoughtfully and tastefully that they almost seem to belong to another movie.”

==Home video==
The film was notable for having a contemporary pop soundtrack, with music by artists like Blondie, Rickie Lee Jones, Supertramp, The Cars, and Iain Matthews. The original video releases—on blue box VHS and laserdisc—kept the soundtrack intact; however, many songs in the film such as Supertramp&#x27;s &quot;School&quot;, John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Oh My Love&quot; and The Bellamy Brothers&#x27; &quot;Let Your Love Flow&quot; were removed from the second round of home releases—VHS red box—due to licensing issues, and were replaced with sound-alikes.

These licensing complications would lead to the film being unavailable on home video for many years; a planned 2012 DVD release by Lionsgate, home video distributors for Paramount catalog titles at that time, was ultimately canceled. The film, with its original theatrical soundtrack, would finally be released on both Blu-ray and 4K UHD formats in January 2024 by Vinegar Syndrome sub-label Cinématographe.

==TV version==
NBC acquired the film&#x27;s broadcasting rights for $2.7 million, and it was first aired on May 9, 1983 in a heavily edited version, removing all scenes and lines alluding to sexual activity, giving the impression that, instead of trying to lose their virginity, Angel and Ferris were engaged in competition simply to make a guy fall in love with them. As was common practice for TV-edited versions of Hollywood films at the time, the deleted scenes were replaced with alternate footage not used in the theatrical version, including a scene in which Angel rescues Ferris from drowning in the lake during a thunderstorm. Some additional music was also used in this version. The director disavowed this version of the film, though the alternate scenes were included on the film&#x27;s Blu-ray release as a bonus.

<text>In psychology and ethology, imprinting is any kind of phase-sensitive learning (learning occurring at a particular age or a particular life stage) that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behaviour. It was first used to describe situations in which an animal or person learns the characteristics of some stimulus, which is therefore said to be &quot;imprinted&quot; onto the subject. Imprinting is hypothesized to have a critical period.

== Filial imprinting ==
The best-known form of imprinting is &quot;filial imprinting&quot;, in which a young animal narrows its social preferences to an object (typically a parent) as a result of exposure to that object. It is most obvious in nidifugous birds, which imprint on their parents and then follow them around. It was first reported in domestic chickens, by Sir Thomas More in 1516 as described in his treatise &quot;Utopia&quot;, 350years earlier than by the 19th-century amateur biologist Douglas Spalding. It was rediscovered by the early ethologist Oskar Heinroth, and studied extensively and popularized by his disciple Konrad Lorenz working with greylag geese.

Lorenz demonstrated how incubator-hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what he called a &quot;critical period&quot; between 13 and 16 hours shortly after hatching. For example, the goslings would imprint on Lorenz himself (to be more specific, on his wading boots), and he is often depicted being followed by a gaggle of geese who had imprinted on him. Lorenz also found that the geese could imprint on inanimate objects. In one notable experiment, they followed a box placed on a model train in circles around the track. Filial imprinting is not restricted to non-human animals that are able to follow their parents, however.

The filial imprinting of birds was a primary technique used to create the movie &quot;Winged Migration&quot; (&quot;Le Peuple Migrateur&quot;), which contains a great deal of footage of migratory birds in flight. The birds imprinted on handlers, who wore yellow jackets and honked horns constantly. The birds were then trained to fly along with a variety of aircraft, primarily ultralights.
The Italian hang-glider pilot Angelo d&#x27;Arrigo extended this technique. D&#x27;Arrigo noted that the flight of a non-motorised hang-glider is very similar to the flight patterns of migratory birds; both use updrafts of hot air (thermal currents) to gain altitude that then permits soaring flight over distance. He used this to reintroduce threatened species of raptors. Because birds hatched in captivity have no mentor birds to teach them traditional migratory routes, D&#x27;Arrigo hatched chicks under the wing of his glider and they imprinted on him. Then, he taught the fledglings to fly and to hunt. The young birds followed him not only on the ground (as with Lorenz) but also in the air as he took the path of various migratory routes. He flew across the Sahara and over the Mediterranean Sea to Sicily with eagles, from Siberia to Iran (5,500 km) with a flock of Siberian cranes, and over Mount Everest with Nepalese eagles. In 2006, he worked with a condor in South America.

In a similar project, orphaned Canada geese were trained to their normal migration route by the Canadian ultralight enthusiast Bill Lishman, as shown in the fact-based movie drama &quot;Fly Away Home&quot;.

Chicks of domestic chickens prefer to be near large groups of objects that they have imprinted on. This behaviour was used to determine that very young chicks of a few days old have rudimentary counting skills. In a series of experiments, they were made to imprint on plastic balls and could figure out which of two groups of balls hidden behind screens had the most balls.

American coot mothers have the ability to recognize their chicks by imprinting on cues from the first chick that hatches. This allows mothers to distinguish their chicks from parasitic chicks.

The peregrine falcon has also been known to imprint on specific structures for their breeding grounds such as cliff sides and bridges and thus will favour that location for breeding.

== Sexual imprinting ==
Sexual imprinting is the process by which a young animal learns the characteristics of a desirable mate. For example, male zebra finches appear to prefer mates with the appearance of the female bird that rears them.

Sexual attraction to humans can develop in non-human mammals or birds as a result of sexual imprinting when reared from young by humans. One example is London Zoo female giant panda Chi Chi. When taken to Moscow Zoo for mating with the male giant panda An An, she refused his attempts to mate with her, but made a full sexual self-presentation to a zookeeper.

It commonly occurs in falconry birds reared from hatching by humans. Such birds are called &quot;imprints&quot; in falconry. When an imprint must be bred from, the breeder lets the male bird copulate with their head while they are wearing a special hat with pockets to catch the male bird&#x27;s semen. The breeder then courts a suitable imprint female bird (including offering food, if it is part of that species&#x27;s normal courtship). At &quot;copulation&quot;, the breeder puts the flat of one hand on the female bird&#x27;s back to represent the weight of a male bird, and with the other hand uses a pipette, or a hypodermic syringe without a needle, to squirt the semen into the female&#x27;s cloaca.

Sexual imprinting on inanimate objects is a popular theory concerning the development of sexual fetishism. For example, according to this theory, imprinting on shoes or boots (as with Konrad Lorenz&#x27;s geese) would be the cause of shoe fetishism.

== Limbic imprinting ==
Some suggest that prenatal, and post-natal experiences leave imprints upon the limbic system, causing lifelong effects and this process is identified as limbic imprinting. The term is also described as the human emotional map, deep-seated beliefs, and values that are stored in the brain&#x27;s limbic system and govern people&#x27;s lives at the subconscious level. It is one of the suggested explanations for the claim that the experiences of an infant, particularly during the first two years of life, contribute to a person&#x27;s lifelong psychological development. Imprinted genes can have astounding effects on body size, brain size, and the process in which the brain organizes its processes. Evolutionary trends within the animal kingdom have been shown to show substantive increase in the forebrain particularly towards the limbic system. This evolution has even been thought of to have a mutative effect on the brain size trickling down the human ancestry.

== Westermarck effect ==

&quot;Reverse&quot; sexual imprinting is also seen in instances where two people who live in domestic proximity during the first few years in the life of either one become desensitized to later close sexual attraction to each other. This phenomenon, known as the Westermarck effect, was first formally described by Finnish anthropologist Edvard Westermarck in his book &quot;The History of Human Marriage&quot; (1891). The Westermarck effect has since been observed in many places and cultures, including in the Israeli kibbutz system, and the Chinese shim-pua marriage customs, as well as in biological-related families.

In the case of the Israeli kibbutzim (collective farms), children were reared somewhat communally in peer groups, based on age, not biological relation. A study of the marriage patterns of these children later in life revealed that out of the nearly 3,000 marriages that occurred across the kibbutz system, only fourteen were between children from the same peer group. Of those fourteen, none had been reared together during the first six years of life. This result provides evidence not only that the Westermarck effect is demonstrable but that it operates during the period from birth to the age of six. However, Eran Shor and Dalit Simchai claimed that the case of the kibbutzim actually provides little support for the Westermarck effect.

When proximity during this critical period does not occur—for example, where a brother and sister are brought up separately, never meeting one another—they may find one another highly sexually attractive when they meet as adults. This phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction. This observation supports the hypothesis that the Westermarck effect evolved because it suppressed inbreeding. This attraction may also be seen with cousin couples.

Sigmund Freud argued that as children, members of the same family naturally lust for one another, making it necessary for societies to create incest taboos, but Westermarck argued the reverse, that the taboos themselves arise naturally as products of innate attitudes. Steven Pinker has written that Freud&#x27;s conception of an urge to incest may have derived from Freud&#x27;s own erotic reaction to his mother as a boy (attested in Freud&#x27;s own writings), and speculates that Freud&#x27;s reaction may have been due to lack of intimacy with his mother in early childhood, as Freud was wet-nursed.

== Baby duck syndrome ==

In human–computer interaction, baby duck syndrome denotes the tendency for computer users to &quot;imprint&quot; on the first system they learn, then judge other systems by their similarity to that first system. The result is that &quot;users generally prefer systems similar to those they learned on and dislike unfamiliar systems&quot;. The issue may present itself relatively early in a computer user&#x27;s experience, and it has been observed to impede education of students in new software systems or user interfaces.

<doc id="187726" wikidata="Q188541" url="?curid=187726" title="Chandragupta Maurya">
<text>Chandragupta Maurya (reigned 320 BCE – c. 298 BCE) was the founder and the first emperor of the Maurya Empire, based in Magadha (present-day Bihar) in the Indian subcontinent.

His rise to power began in the period of unrest and local warfare that arose after Alexander the Great&#x27;s Indian campaign and early death in 323 BCE, although the exact chronology and sequence of events remains subject to debate among historians. He started a war against the unpopular Nanda dynasty in Magadha on the Ganges Valley, defeated them and established his own dynasty. In addition, he raised an army to resist the Greeks, defeated them, and took control of the eastern Indus Valley. His conquest of Magadha is generally dated to ca. 322-319 BCE, and his expansion to Punjab subsequently at ca. 317-312 BCE, but some scholars have speculated that he might have initially consolidated his power base in Punjab, before conquering Magadha; an alternative chronology places these events all in the period ca. 311-305 BCE. According to Buddhist and Jain legends, Chandragupta was assisted by his mentor Chanakya, who later became his minister. He expanded his reach subsequently into parts of the western Indus Valley and possibly eastern Afghanistan through a dynastic marriage alliance with Seleucus I Nicator ca. 305-303 BCE. His empire also included Gujarat and a geographically extensive network of cities and trade-routes.

There are no historical facts about Chandragupta&#x27;s origins and early life, only legends, while the narrative of his reign is mainly deduced from a few fragments in Greek and Roman sources, and a few Indian religious texts, all written centuries after his death. The prevailing levels of technology and infrastructure limited the extent of Chandragupta&#x27;s rule, and the administration was decentralised, with provinces and local governments, and large autonomous regions within its limits. Chandragupta&#x27;s reign, and the Maurya Empire, which reached its peak under his grandson Ashoka the Great, began an era of economic prosperity, reforms, infrastructure expansions. Buddhism, Jainism and Ājīvika prevailed over the non-Maghadian Vedic and Brahmanistic traditions, initiating, under Ashoka, the expansion of Buddhism, and the synthesis of Brahmanic and non-Brahmanic religious traditions which converged in Hinduism. His legend still inspires visions of an undivided Indian nation.

==Historical sources==
Chandragupta&#x27;s confrontations with the Greeks and the Nanda king are shortly referred to in a few passages in Greek-Roman sources from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE. Impressions of India at that time are given by a number of other Greek sources. He is further mentioned in Brahmanical, Buddhist, and Jain religious texts and legends, which give impressions of his later reception; they significantly vary in detail. According to Mookerji, the main sources on Chandragupta and his time, in chronological order are:
* Greek sources by three companions of Alexander, namely Nearchus, Onesicritus, and Aristobulus of Cassandreia, who write about Alexander and do not mention Chandragupta; 
* The Greek ambassador Megasthanes, a contemporary of Chandragupta, whose works are lost, but fragments are preserved in the works of other authors, namely Greco-Roman authors Strabo (64 BCE-19 CE), Diodorus (died ca. 36 BCE, wrote about India), Arrian (ca. 130 CE-172 CE, wrote about India), Pliny the Elder (1st cent. CE, wrote about India), Plutarch (c. 45-125 CE), and Justin (2nd cent. CE). According to Mookerji, without these sources this period would be &quot;a most obscure chapter of Indian history.&quot; 
* The Brahmanical Puranas (Gupta-times), religious texts which viewed the Nandas and Mauryas as illegitimate rulers, because of their shudra background; 
* Later Brahmanical narratives include legends in Vishakhadatta&#x27;s Mudrarakshasa (4th-8th cent), Somadeva&#x27;s Kathasaritsagara (11th cent.) and Kshemendra&#x27;s Brihatkathamanjari (11th ). Mookerji includes the Arthasastra as a source, a text now dated to the 1st-3rd century CE, and attributed to Chanakya during Gupta-times.
* The earliest Buddhist sources are dated to the fourth-century CE or after, including the Sri Lankan Pali texts Dipavamsa (&quot;Rajavamsa&quot; section), Mahavamsa, Mahavamsa tika and Mahabodhivamsa.
* 7th to 10th century Jain inscriptions at Shravanabelgola; these are disputed by scholars as well as the Svetambara Jain tradition. The second Digambara text interpreted to be mentioning the Maurya emperor is dated to about the 10th-century such as in the &quot;Brhatkathakosa&quot; of Harisena (Jain monk), while the complete Jain legend about Chandragupta is found in the 12th-century Parisishtaparvan by Hemachandra.

The Greek and Roman texts do not mention Chandragupta directly, except for a second-century text written by the Roman historian Justin. They predominantly describe India, or mention the last Nanda emperor, who usurped the throne of the king before him (Curtis, Diodorus, Plutarch). Justin states that Chandragupta was of humble origin, and includes stories of miraculous legends associated with him, such as a wild elephant appearing and submitting itself to him as a ride to him before a battle. Justin&#x27;s text states that Chandragupta &quot;achieved [India&#x27;s] freedom, and &quot;aspired to royalty by all men,&quot; as he offended Nanda and was ordered to death, but saved himself &quot;by a speedy flight.&quot;

Plutarch states that Chandragupta, as a young man, saw Alexander the Great. He is described as a great king, but not as great in power and influence as Porus in northwestern India or Agrammes (Dhana Nanda) in eastern India.

The Brahmanical Puranic texts do not discuss the details of Chandragupta&#x27;s ancestry, but rather cover the ancestry of the last Nanda king, and the restoration of just rule by Kautilya (Chanakya; the identification with Kautilya, the author of the Arthashastra, dates from a later period). The Nanda king is described to be cruel, against dharma and shastras, and born out of an illicit relationship followed by a coup. According to Mookerji, the &quot;Arthasastra&quot; refers to the Nanda rule as against the spiritual, cultural, and military interests of the country, a period where intrigue and vice multiplied. In a later addition, the &quot;Arthasastra&quot; states that the text was written by him who returned dharma, nurtured diversity of views, and ruled virtuously that kindled love among the subjects for his rule, an insertion linking the Guptas to the Mauryans.

Buddhist texts such as &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; describe Chandragupta to be of Kshatriya origin. These sources, written about seven centuries after his dynasty ended, state that both Chandragupta and his grandson Ashoka – a patron of Buddhism were Moriyas, a branch of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s Shakya noble family. These Buddhist sources attempt to link the dynasty of their patron Ashoka directly to the Buddha. The sources claim that the family branched off to escape persecution from a King of Kosala and Chandragupta&#x27;s ancestors moved into a secluded Himalayan kingdom known for its peacocks. The Buddhist sources explain the epithet &quot;maurya&quot; comes from these peacocks, or &quot;Mora&quot; in Pali (Sanskrit: Mayura). The Buddhist texts are inconsistent; some offer other legends to explain his epithet. For example, they mention a city named &quot;Moriya-nagara&quot; where all buildings were made of bricks colored like the peacock&#x27;s neck. The &quot;Maha-bodhi-vasa&quot; states he hailed from Moriya-nagara, while the &quot;Digha-Nikaya&quot; states he came from the Maurya clan of Pipphalivana. The Buddhist sources also mention that &quot;Brahmin Chanakya&quot; was his counselor and with whose support Chandragupta became the king at Patliputra. He has also been variously identified with Shashigupta (which has same etymology as of Chandragupta) of Paropamisadae on the account of same life events.
The 12th-century Digambara text &quot;Parishishtaparvan&quot; by Hemachandra is the main and earliest Jain source of the complete legend of Chandragupta. It was written nearly 1,400 years after Chandragupta&#x27;s death. Canto 8, verses 170 to 469, describes the legend of Chandragupta and Chanakya&#x27;s influence on him. Other Digambara Jain sources state he moved to Karnataka after renouncing his kingdom and performed Sallekhana – the Jain religious ritual of peacefully welcoming death by fasting. The earliest mention of Chandragupta&#x27;s ritual death is found in Harisena&#x27;s &quot;Brhatkathakosa&quot;, a Sanskrit text of stories about Digambara Jains. The &quot;Brhatkathakosa&quot; describes the legend of Bhadrabahu and mentions Chandragupta in its 131st story. However, the story makes no mention of the Maurya empire, and mentions that his disciple Chandragupta lived in and migrated from Ujjain – a kingdom (northwest Madhya Pradesh) about a thousand kilometers west of the Magadha and Patliputra (central Bihar). This has led to the proposal that Harisena&#x27;s Chandragupta may be a later era, different person.

==Biographical information==

=== Date ===
None of the ancient texts mention when Chandragupta was born. Plutarch claims that Chandragupta in his youth saw Alexander the Great during the latter&#x27;s invasion of India (-325 BCE): Assuming the Plutarch account is true, Raychaudhuri proposed in 1923 that Chandragupta may have been born after 350 BCE. There is also a passage of Justin&#x27;s history which had been read as referring to a meeting between Chandragupta and Alexander. However, according to Thomas Trautmann, this was a due to mistranslation in early printed book, and the correct reading was &quot;Nandrum&quot; (Nanada king), rather than &quot;Alexandrum&quot;. 

According to other Greco-Roman texts, Chandragupta attacked the Greek-Indian governors during a period of unrest and local warfare after Alexander&#x27;s death (died ), acquiring control of the eastern Indus Valley. The chronology and dating of Chandragupta&#x27;s activitities in the Punjab is uncertain, either before or after he took the Nanda-throne. The defeat of the Greeks is dated by Mookerji at 323; Jansari dates the arrival of Chandragupta in the Punjab at ca. 317, in line with the chronology of Greek history.

The texts do not include the start or end year of Chandragupta&#x27;s reign. According to some Hindu and Buddhist texts, Chandragupta ruled for 24 years. The Buddhist sources state Chandragupta Maurya ruled 162 years after the death of the Buddha. However, the Buddha&#x27;s birth and death vary by source and all these lead to a chronology that is significantly different from the Greco-Roman records. Similarly, Jain sources composed give different gaps between Mahavira&#x27;s death and his accession. As with the Buddha&#x27;s death, the date of Mahavira&#x27;s death itself is also a matter of debate, and the inconsistencies and lack of unanimity among the Jain authors cast doubt on Jain sources. This Digambara Jain chronology, also, is not reconcilable with the chronology implied in other Indian and non-Indian sources.

Historians such as Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha assign Chandragupta&#x27;s reign to c. 322-298 BCE. Upinder Singh dates his rule from 324 or 321 BCE to 297 BCE. Kristi Wiley states he reigned between 320 and 293 BCE. Jansari, admitting that c.320/319 is the date conventionally accepted by most scholars, follows Cribb in re-assessing Justin (XV section 4.12-22), who states that Chandragupta&#x27;s became &quot;‘ruler of India’ when Seleucus was ‘laying the foundations’ of his own empire.&quot; According to Jansari, &quot;this reference appears to refer to the period c.311– c.308,&quot; implying that &quot;Chandragupta gained power, and was possibly already the first Mauryan king, between c.311 and c.305 BCE.&quot;

Chandragupta and Seleucus Nicator entered into a dynastic marriage-alliance at ca. 305-303 BCE.

The circumstances and year of Chandragupta&#x27;s death are also unclear and disputed. According to Roy, Chandragupta&#x27;s abdication of throne may be dated to c. 298 BCE, and his death between 297 and 293 BCE.

=== Name ===
Greek writer Phylarchus (c. third century BCE), who is quoted by Athenaeus, calls Chandragupta &quot;Sandrokoptos&quot;. The later Greco-Roman writers Strabo, Arrian, and Justin (c. second century) call him &quot;Sandrocottus&quot;. In Greek and Latin accounts, Chandragupta is known as Sandrakottos () and Androcottus ().

British orientialist and philologist Sir William Jones (1746–1794) was the first to propose, in 1793, that Chandragupta Maurya known from the Sanskrit literature must be equivalent to the Indian king known as &quot;Sandracottus&quot; in Graeco-Roman historical sources. Jones&#x27; discovery &quot;was of vital importance,&quot; states historian Sushma Jansari, because &quot;it meant, for the first time, that Indian and Graeco-Roman history could be synchronised and dates assigned to this period of ancient Indian history.&quot; Consequently, Chandragupta&#x27;s reign has been referred to as &quot;the of Indian chronology.&quot;

===Titles===
The king&#x27;s epithets mentioned in the Sanskrit play &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; include &quot;Chanda-siri&quot; (Chandra-shri), &quot;Piadamsana&quot; (Priya-darshana), and Vrishala. Piadamsana is similar to Priyadasi, an epithet of his grandson Ashoka. The word &quot;Vrishala&quot; is used in Indian epics and law books to refer to non-orthodox people. According to one theory, it may be derived from the Greek royal title Basileus, but there is no concrete evidence of this: the Indian sources apply it to several non-royals, especially wandering teachers and ascetics.

===Religion===
In contrast to the Jain legends which developed 900 years later, contemporary Greek evidence states that Chandragupta did not give up performing the rites of sacrificing animals associated with Vedic Brahminism; he delighted in hunting and otherwise leading a life remote from the Jain practice of &quot;ahimsa&quot; or nonviolence towards living beings.

==Biography==

===Historical background===
Around 350 BCE Magadha, ruled by the Nanda dynasty, emerged as the dominant power after a &quot;process of internecine warfare&quot; between the janapadas.

Alexander the Great entered the Northwest Indian subcontinent in his Indian campaign, which he aborted in 325 BCE due to a mutiny caused by the prospect of facing another large empire, presumably the Nanda Empire, and before Chandragupta came into power. Alexander left India, and assigned the northwestern (Indus Valley) Indian subcontinent territories to Greek governors. He died in 323 BCE in Babylon, whereafter war broke out between his generals.

===Early life===

====Family background====
There is no historical information on Chandragupta&#x27;s youth. One medieval commentator states Chandragupta to be the son of one of the Nanda&#x27;s wives with the name Mura. Other naratives describe Mura as a concubine of the king. Another Sanskrit dramatic text Mudrarakshasa uses the terms &quot;Vrishala&quot; and &quot;Kula-Hina&quot; (meaning - &quot;not descending from a recognized clan or family&quot;) to describe Chandragupta. The word &quot;Vrishala&quot; has two meanings: one is the &quot;son of a shudra&quot;; the other means the &quot;best of kings&quot;. A later commentator used the former interpretation to posit that Chandragupta had a Shudra background. However, historian Radha Kumud Mukherjee opposed this theory, and stated that the word should be interpreted as &quot;the best of kings&quot;. The same drama also refers to Chandragupta as someone of humble origin, like Justin. According to the 11th-century texts of the Kashmiri Hindu tradition – Kathasaritsagara and &quot;Brihat-Katha-Manjari&quot; – the Nanda lineage was very short. Chandragupta was a son of Purva-Nanda, the older Nanda based in Ayodhya. The common theme in the Hindu sources is that Chandragupta came from a humble background and with Chanakya, he emerged as a dharmic king loved by his subjects.

====Chanakya====
Legends about Chanakya couple him to Chandragupta, acting as his mentor and spiritual teacher, complementing the image of a chakravartin.

According to the Digambara legend by Hemachandra, Chanakya was a Jain layperson and a Brahmin. When Chanakya was born, Jain monks prophesied that Chanakya will one day grow up to help make someone an emperor and will be the power behind the throne. Chanakya believed in the prophecy and fulfilled it by agreeing to help the daughter of a peacock-breeding community chief deliver a baby boy. In exchange, he asked the mother to give up the boy and let him adopt him at a later date. The Jain Brahmin then went about making money through magic, and returned later to claim young Chandragupta, whom he taught and trained. Together, they recruited soldiers and attacked the Nanda Empire. Eventually, they won and proclaimed Patliputra as their capital.

The Buddhist and Hindu legends present different versions of how Chandragupta met Chanakya. Broadly, they mention young Chandragupta creating a mock game of a royal court that he and his shepherd friends played near Vinjha forest. Chanakya saw him give orders to the others, bought him from the hunter, and adopted Chandragupta. Chanakya taught and admitted him in Taxila to study the Vedas, military arts, law, and other shastras.

According to the Buddhist legend, Chanakya was chosen as president of the &quot;samgha&quot; which administered the &quot;Danasala&quot;, a charity foundation, but was dismissed by Dhana Nanda due to his ugliness and manners. Chanaky cursed the king, fled Pataliputra, and then met Chandragupta.

===Rise to power===

====Unrest and warfare in the Punjab====

The Roman historian Justin (2nd Century CE) states, in &quot;Epit. 15.4.12-13&quot;, that after Alexander&#x27;s death, Greek governors in India were assassinated, liberating the people of Greek rule. This revolt led by Chandragupta, who in turn established an oppressive regime himself &quot;after taking the throne&quot;:
Raychaudhuri states that, according to Justin &quot;Epitome&quot; 15.4.18–19, Chandragupta organized an army. He notes that early translators interpreted Justin&#x27;s original expression as &quot;body of robbers&quot;, but states Raychaudhuri, the original expression used by Justin may mean mercenary soldier, hunter, or robber. Mookerji refers to McCrindle as stating that &quot;robbers&quot; refers to the people of the Punjab, &quot;kingless people.&quot; Mookerju further quotes Rhys Davids, who states that &quot;it was from the Punjab that Chandragupta recruited the nucleus of the force with which he besieged and conquered Dhana-Nanda.&quot;

The nature of early relationship between these governors and Chandragupta is unknown. According to Habib &amp;Jha, Justin mentions Chandragupta as a rival of the Alexander&#x27;s successors in north-western India. Alain Daniélou further explains:
According to Mookerji, the Buddhist text &quot;Mahavamsa Tika&quot; describes how Chandragupta and Chanakya raised an army by recruiting soldiers from many places after the former completed his education at Taxila, to resist the Greeks. Chanakya made Chandragupta the leader of the army. The Digambara Jain text &quot;Parishishtaparvan&quot; states that this army was raised by Chanakya with coins he minted and an alliance formed with Parvataka. According to Nath Sen, Chandragupta recruited and annexed local military republics such as the Yaudheyas that had resisted Alexander&#x27;s Empire. 

The chronology and dating of Chandragupta&#x27;s activitities in the Punjab is uncertain. This may be either before or after he took the Nanda-throne. The defeat of the Greeks is dated by Mookerji at 323 BCE; Jansari dates the arrival of Chandragupta in the Punjab at ca. 317, in line with the chronology of Greek history.

====Offense of the Nanda-king and flight====
According to Justin, Chandragupta offended the Nanda king (&quot;Nandrum&quot; or &quot;Nandrus&quot;) who ordered his execution. Mookerji quotes Justin as stating
Justin narrates two miraculous incidents as omens and portents of Sandracottus (Chandragupta) fate. In the first incident, when Chandragupta was asleep after having escaped from Nandrum, a big lion came up to him, licked him, and then left. In the second incident, when Chandragupta was readying for war with Alexander&#x27;s generals, a huge wild elephant approached him and offered itself to be his steed.

The &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; states that Chanakya felt insulted by the king, whereafter he swore to destroy the Nanda dynasty. The Jain version states that it was the Nanda king who was publicly insulted by Chanakya. In either case, Chanakya fled, found Chandragupta, and started a war against the Nanda king.

==== War against the Nandas and seizure of Pataliputra ====

According to Mookerji, &quot;after&quot; defeating the Greeks, the army of Chandragupta and Chanakya revolted against the unpopular Nandas and conquered the Nanda outer territories, and then advanced on Pataliputra, the capital city of the Nanda Empire, which according to Mookerji they conquered deploying guerrilla warfare methods with the help of mercenaries from conquered areas. With the defeat of Dhana Nanda, Chandragupta Maurya founded the Maurya Empire. 

The Buddhist &quot;Mahavamsa Tika&quot; and Jain &quot;Parishishtaparvan&quot; records Chandragupta&#x27;s army unsuccessfully attacking the Nanda capital. Chandragupta and Chanakya then began a campaign at the frontier of the Nanda empire, gradually conquering various territories on their way to the Nanda capital. He then refined his strategy by establishing garrisons in the conquered territories, and finally besieged the Nanda capital Pataliputra. There Dhana Nanda accepted defeat. In contrast to the easy victory in Buddhist sources, the Hindu and Jain texts state that the campaign was bitterly fought because the Nanda dynasty had a powerful and well-trained army. These legends state that the Nanda emperor was defeated, deposed and exiled by some accounts, while Buddhist accounts claim he was killed.

Historically reliable details of Chandragupta&#x27;s campaign into Pataliputra are unavailable and the legends written centuries later are inconsistent. While his victory, and ascencion of the throne, is usually dated at ca. 322-319 BCE, which would put his war in the Punjab after his ascencion, an ascencion &quot;between c. 311-305 BCE&quot; is also possible, placing his activity in the Punjab at ca. 317 BCE.

The conquest was fictionalised in &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot;, in which Chandragupta is said to have acquired Punjab, and then allied with a local king named Parvatka under the Chanakya&#x27;s advice, where-after they advanced on Pataliputra.
In contrast to the easy victory of Buddhist sources, the Hindu and Jain texts state that the campaign was bitterly fought because the Nanda dynasty had a powerful and well-trained army.Greco-Roman writer Plutarch stated, in his &quot;Life of Alexander&quot;, that the Nanda king was so unpopular that had Alexander tried, he could have easily conquered India. Buddhist texts such as &quot;Milindapanha&quot; claim Magadha was ruled by the Nanda dynasty, which, with Chanakya&#x27;s counsel, Chandragupta conquered to restore &quot;dhamma&quot;.

Legends narrate that the Nanda emperor was defeated, but was allowed to leave Pataliputra alive with a chariot full of items his family needed. The Jain sources attest that his daughter fell in love at first sight with Chandragupta and married him.Though daughter is not named the source later name mother of Chandragupta&#x27;s son as Durdhara.

===Dynastic marriage-alliance with Seleucus===

According to Appian, Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander&#x27;s Macedonian generals who in 312 BCE established the Seleucid Empire with its capital at Babylon, brought Persia and Bactria under his own authority, putting his eastern front facing the empire of Chandragupta.

Somewhere between 305 and 303 BCE Seleucus and Chandragupta confronted each other, Seleucus intending to retake the former satrapies each of the Indus. Yet, Seleucus Nicator and Chandragupta formed a dynastic marriage-alliance, Seleucus receiving five hundred elephants, and Chandragupta gaining control over the regions bordering at the east on the Indus. Strabo, in his &quot;Geographica&quot;, XV, 2.9 composed about 300 years after Chandragupta&#x27;s death, describes a number of tribes living along the Indus, and then states that &quot;The Indians occupy [in part] some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians.&quot;
The exact extent of the acquired territories is unknown. A modest interpretation limits the extension to the western Indus Valley, including the coast of eastern Gedrosia (Balochistan) up to the Malan mountain raing (Hingol river), the Punjab, and the eastern part of Paropamisadae (Gandhara). Arachosia (Kandahar, present-day Afghanistan), is a possibility, while Aria (present-day Herat, Afghanistan) is also often mentioned, but rejected by contemporary scholarship. Tarn, writing in 1922, and Coningham and Young, have questioned the inclusion of eastern Afghanistan (Kabul-Kandahar), Coningham and Young noting that &quot;a growing number of researchers would now agree that the Ashokan edicts may have represented &#x27;an area of maximum contact rather than streamlined bureaucratic control&#x27;.&quot; Coningham &amp; Young also question the extent of control over the lower Indus Valley, following Thapar, noting that this may have been an area of peripheral control. Raymond Allchin also notes the absence of major cities in the lower Indus valley.

The details of the engagement treaty are also not known. Since the extensive sources available on Seleucus never mention an Indian princess, it is thought that Chandragupta himself or his son Bindusara marrying a Seleucid princess, in accordance with contemporary Greek practices to form dynastic alliances. The Mahavamsa states that Chandragupta married a daughter of Seleucus not long after the latter&#x27;s defeat. As well, an Indian Puranic source, the Pratisarga Parva of the Bhavishya Purana, described the marriage of Chandragupta with a Greek (&quot;Yavana&quot;) princess, daughter of Seleucus.

Chandragupta sent 500 war elephants to Seleucus, which played a key role in Seleucus&#x27; victory at the Battle of Ipsus. In addition to this treaty, Seleucus dispatched Megasthenes as an ambassador to Chandragupta&#x27;s court, and later Antiochos sent Deimakos to his son Bindusara at the Maurya court at Patna.

Megasthenes served as a Greek ambassador in his court for four years.

===Control of Gujarat===
In the south-west, Chandragupta&#x27;s rule over present-day Gujarat is attested to by Ashoka&#x27;s inscription in Junagadh. On the same rock, about 400 years later, Rudradaman inscribed a longer text sometime about the mid second–century. Rudradaman&#x27;s inscription states that the Sudarshana lake in the area was commissioned during the rule of Chandragupta through his governor Vaishya Pushyagupta and conduits were added during Ashoka&#x27;s rule through Tushaspha. The Mauryan control of the region is further corroborated by the inscription on the rock, which suggests that Chandragupta controlled the Malwa region in Central India, located between Gujarat and Pataliputra.

=== Jain accounts of renunciation and retirement in Karnakata ===


According to Digambara Jain accounts Chandragupta abdicated at an early age and settled as a monk under Bhadrabāhu in Shravanabelagola, in present-day south Karnataka. According to these accounts, Bhadrabāhu forecast a 12-year famine because of all the killing and violence during the conquests by Chandragupta Maurya. He led a group of Jain monks to south India, where Chandragupta Maurya joined him as a monk after abdicating his empire to his son Bindusara. Together, states a Digambara legend, Chandragupta and Bhadrabahu moved to Shravanabelagola, in present-day south Karnataka. Chandragupta lived as an ascetic at Shravanabelagola for several years before fasting to death as per the practice of &quot;sallekhana&quot;, according to the Digambara legend. In accordance with the Digambara tradition, the hill on which Chandragupta is stated to have performed asceticism is now known as Chandragiri hill, and Digambaras believe that Chandragupta Maurya erected an ancient temple that now survives as the Chandragupta basadi.

The 12th-century Svetambara Jain legend by Hemachandra presents a different picture. The Hemachandra version includes stories about Jain monks who could become invisible to steal food from imperial storage and the Jain Brahmin Chanakya using violence and cunning tactics to expand Chandragupta&#x27;s empire and increase imperial revenues. It states in verses 8.415 to 8.435, that for 15 years as emperor, Chandragupta was a follower of non-Jain &quot;ascetics with the wrong view of religion&quot; and &quot;lusted for women&quot;. Chanakya, who was a Jain convert himself, persuaded Chandragupta to convert to Jainism by showing that Jain ascetics avoided women and focused on their religion. The legend mentions Chanakya aiding the premature birth of Bindusara, It states in verse 8.444 that &quot;Chandragupta died in meditation (can possibly be &quot;sallekhana&quot;.) and went to heaven&quot;. According to Hemachandra&#x27;s legend, Chanakya also performed &quot;sallekhana&quot;.

====Textual sources====
The Digambara Jain accounts are recorded in the &quot;Brihakathā kośa&quot; (931 CE) of Harishena, &quot;Bhadrabāhu charita&quot; (1450 CE) of Ratnanandi, &quot;Munivaṃsa bhyudaya&quot; (1680 CE) and &quot;Rajavali kathe&quot;,

Regarding the inscriptions describing the relation of Bhadrabahu and Chandragupta Maurya, Radha Kumud Mookerji writes,The oldest inscription of about 600 AD associated &quot;the pair (&quot;yugma&quot;), Bhadrabahu along with Chandragupta &quot;Muni&quot;.&quot; Two inscriptions of about 900 AD on the Kaveri near Seringapatam describe the summit of a hill called Chandragiri as marked by the footprints of Bhadrabahu and Chandragupta &quot;munipati&quot;. A Shravanabelagola inscription of 1129 mentions Bhadrabahu &quot;Shrutakevali&quot;, and Chandragupta who acquired such merit that he was worshipped by the forest deities. Another inscription of 1163 similarly couples and describes them. A third inscription of the year 1432 speaks of &quot;Yatindra&quot; Bhadrabahu, and his disciple Chandragupta, the fame of whose penance spread into other words.Along with texts, several Digambara Jain inscriptions dating from the 7th–15th century refer to Bhadrabahu and a Prabhacandra. Later Digambara tradition identified the Prabhacandra as Chandragupta, and some modern era scholars have accepted this Digambara tradition while others have not, Several of the late Digambara inscriptions and texts in Karnataka state the journey started from Ujjain and not Patliputra (as stated in some Digambara texts).

====Analysis of the sources====
According to Jeffery D. Long, in one Digambara version it was Samprati Chandragupta who renounced, migrated and performed &quot;sallekhana&quot; in Shravanabelagola. Long notes that scholars attribute the disintegration of the Maurya empire to the times and actions of Samprati Chandragupta, the grandson of Ashoka and great-great-grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, concluding that the two Chandraguptas have been confused to be the same in some Digambara legends.

Scholar of Jain studies and Sanskrit Paul Dundas says the Svetambara tradition of Jainism disputes the ancient Digambara legends. According to a fifth-century text of the Svetambara Jains, the Digambara sect of Jainism was founded 609 years after Mahavira&#x27;s death, or in first-century CE. Digambaras wrote their own versions and legends after the fifth-century, with their first expanded Digambara version of sectarian split within Jainism appearing in the tenth-century. The Svetambaras texts describe Bhadrabahu was based near Nepalese foothills of the Himalayas in third-century BCE, who neither moved nor travelled with Chandragupta Maurya to the south; rather, he died near Patliputra, according to the Svetambara Jains.

According to V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar – an Indologist and historian, several of the Digambara legends mention Prabhacandra, who had been misidentified as Chandragupta Maurya particularly after the original publication on Shravanabelagola epigraphy by B. Lewis Rice. The earliest and most important inscriptions mention Prabhacandra, which Rice presumed may have been the &quot;clerical name assumed by Chadragupta Maurya&quot; after he renounced and moved with Bhadrabahu from Patliputra. Dikshitar stated there is no evidence to support this and Prabhacandra was an important Jain monk scholar who migrated centuries after Chandragupta Maurya&#x27;s death.

According to historian Sushma Jansari, &quot;A closer look at the evidence for Chandragupta&#x27;s conversion to Jainism and his and Bhadrabāhu&#x27;s association with Śravaṇa Beḷgoḷa reveals that it is both late and problematic. In addition, except for Jain sources, there is no evidence to support the view of Chandragupta&#x27;s conversion and migration.&quot; Jansari concludes, &quot;Overall, therefore, the evidence as it currently stands suggests that the story of Chandragupta&#x27;s conversion to Jainism and abdication (if, indeed, he did abdicate), his migration southwards and his association (or otherwise) with Bhadrabāhu and the site of Śravaṇa Beḷgoḷa developed after c.600 AD.&quot;

Dikshitar has taken Rice&#x27;s deduction of Chandragupta Maurya retiring and dying in Shravanabelagola as the working hypothesis, since no alternative historical information or evidence is available about Chandragupta&#x27;s final years and death.

====Assumed control of Southern India====
There is uncertainty about the other conquests that Chandragupta may have achieved, especially in the Deccan region of southern India. At the time of his grandson Ashoka&#x27;s ascension in c. 268 BCE, the empire extended up to present-day Karnataka in the south, so the southern conquests may be attributed to either Chandragupta or his son Bindusara.

According to Mookerji, Chandragupta expanded his empire into the south, referring to Plutarch, who stated that &quot;Androcottus [...] with an army of six hundred thousand men overran and subdued all India.&quot; Mookerji notes that details are lacking, but argues that &quot;there is reliable evidence for it in the inscriptions of Ashoka.&quot; Mookerji also refers to the Jain tradition that Chandragupta retired at Sravana Belgola, Karnakata, and to references in Tamil records.

According to Kulke and Rothermund, if the Jain tradition about Chandragupta ending his life as a renunciate in Karnakata is considered correct, it appears that Chandragupta initiated the southern conquest.

Yet, the Digambara Jain accounts are problematic. His conversion and retirement at Śravaṇa Beḷgoḷa with Bhadrabāhu are only attested in Digambara Jain sources, which developed after 600 CE. They may actually refer to Samprati Chandragupta the great-great-grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, and are contradicted by Svetambaras Jain texts, who situate Bhadrabahunear the Nepalese foothills of the Himalayas in third-century BCE, neither moving nor travelling with Chandragupta Maurya to the south. The Digambara legends may also have misidentified Prabhacandra, an important Jain monk scholar who migrated centuries after Chandragupta Maurya&#x27;s death, as Chandragupta Maurya.

Two poetic anthologies from the Tamil Sangam literature corpus – &quot;Akananuru&quot; and &quot;Purananuru&quot; – allude to the Nanda rule and Maurya empire. For example, poems 69, 281 and 375 mention the army and chariots of the Mauryas, while poems 251 and 265 may be alluding to the Nandas. However, the poems dated between first-century BCE to fifth-century CE do not mention Chandragupta Maurya by name, and some of them could be referring to a different Moriya dynasty in the Deccan region in the fifth century CE. According to Upinder Singh, these poems may be mentioning Mokur and Koshar kingdoms of Vadugars (northerners) in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, with one interpretation being that the Maurya Empire had an alliance with these at some point of time.

==Empire==

=== Administration ===

After conquering northern India, Chandragupta and Chanakya passed a series of major economic and political reforms. Chandragupta established a decentralised administration with provinces and local governments, and a &quot;mantriparishad&quot; (council of advisers) advising the king. While it is often thought that Chandragupta applied the statecraft and economic policies described in &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, which was earlierly thought to be written by his minister Chanakya but it&#x27;s now thought by most scholars that the Arthashastra is not of Mauryan origin, and contains prescriptions which are incompatible with Chandragupta&#x27;s reign.

The Maurya rule was a structured administration; Chandragupta had a council of ministers (&quot;amatya&quot;), with Chanakya was his chief minister. The empire was organised into territories (&quot;janapada&quot;), centres of regional power were protected with forts (&quot;durga&quot;), and state operations were funded with treasury (&quot;kosa&quot;). Strabo, in his &quot;Geographica&quot; composed about 300 years after Chandragupta&#x27;s death, describes aspects of his rule in his chapter XV.46–69. He had councillors for matters of justice and assessors to collect taxes on commercial activity and trade goods. His officers inspected situations requiring law and order in the cities; the crime rate was low.

According to Megasthenes, Chandragupta&#x27;s rule was marked by three parallel administrative structures. One managed the affairs of villages, ensuring irrigation, recording land ownership, monitoring tools supply, enforcing hunting, wood products and forest-related laws, and settling disputes. Another administrative structure managed city affairs, including all matters related to trade, merchant activity, visit of foreigners, harbors, roads, temples, markets, and industries. They also collected taxes and ensured standardized weights and measures. The third administrative body overlooked the military, its training, its weapons supply, and the needs of the soldiers.

Chanakya was concerned about Chandragupta&#x27;s safety and developed elaborate techniques to prevent assassination attempts. Various sources report Chandragupta frequently changed bedrooms to confuse conspirators. He left his palace only for certain tasks: to go on military expeditions, to visit his court for dispensing justice, to offer sacrifices, for celebrations, and for hunting. During celebrations, he was well-guarded, and on hunts, he was surrounded by female guards who were presumed to be less likely to participate in a coup conspiracy. These strategies may have resulted from the historical context of the Nanda emperor who had come to power by assassinating the previous emperor.

During Chandragupta&#x27;s reign and that of his dynasty, many religions thrived in India, with Buddhism, Jainism and Ajivika gaining prominence along with other folk traditions.

=== Infrastructure projects ===

The empire built a strong economy from a solid infrastructure such as irrigation, temples, mines, and roads. Ancient epigraphical evidence suggests Chandragupta, under counsel from Chanakya, started and completed many irrigation reservoirs and networks across the Indian subcontinent to ensure food supplies for the civilian population and the army, a practice continued by his dynastic successors. Regional prosperity in agriculture was one of the required duties of his state officials.

The strongest evidence of infrastructure development is found in the Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman in Gujarat, dated to about 150 CE. It states, among other things, that Rudradaman repaired and enlarged the reservoir and irrigation conduit infrastructure built by Chandragupta and enhanced by Asoka. Chandragupta&#x27;s empire also built mines, manufacturing centres, and networks for trading goods. His rule developed land routes to transport goods across the Indian subcontinent. Chandragupta expanded &quot;roads suitable for carts&quot; as he preferred those over narrow tracks suitable for only pack animals.

According to Kaushik Roy, the Maurya dynasty rulers were &quot;great road builders&quot;. The Greek ambassador Megasthenes credited this tradition to Chandragupta after the completion of a thousand-mile-long highway connecting Chandragupta&#x27;s capital Pataliputra in Bihar to Taxila in the north-west where he studied. The other major strategic road infrastructure credited to this tradition spread from Pataliputra in various directions, connecting it with Nepal, Kapilavastu, Dehradun, Mirzapur, Odisha, Andhra, and Karnataka. Roy stated this network boosted trade and commerce, and helped move armies rapidly and efficiently.

Chandragupta and Chanakya seeded weapon manufacturing centres, and kept them as a state monopoly of the state. The state, however, encouraged competing private parties to operate mines and supply these centres. They considered economic prosperity essential to the pursuit of dharma (virtuous life) and adopted a policy of avoiding war with diplomacy yet continuously preparing the army for war to defend its interests and other ideas in the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;.

=== Arts and architecture ===
The evidence of arts and architecture during Chandragupta&#x27;s time is mostly limited to texts such as those by Megasthenese and Kautilya. The edict inscriptions and carvings on monumental pillars are attributed to his grandson Ashoka. The texts imply the existence of cities, public works, and prosperous architecture but the historicity of these is in question.

Archeological discoveries in the modern age, such as those Didarganj Yakshi discovered in 1917 buried beneath the banks of the Ganges suggest exceptional artisanal accomplishment. The site was dated to third century BCE by many scholars but later dates such as the Kushan era (1st-4th century CE) have also been proposed. The competing theories state that the art linked to Chandragupta Maurya&#x27;s dynasty was learnt from the Greeks and West Asia in the years Alexander the Great waged war; or that these artifacts belong to an older indigenous Indian tradition. Frederick Asher of the University of Minnesota says &quot;we cannot pretend to have definitive answers; and perhaps, as with most art, we must recognize that there is no single answer or explanation&quot;.

===Religion===
Chandragupta sponsored Vedic sacrifices and Brahmanical rituals, and hosted major festivals marked by procession of elephants and horses.

While many religions thrived within his realms and his descendants&#x27; empire, Buddhism, Jainism and Ājīvika gained prominence prevailing over Vedic and Brahmanistic traditions, intitiating, under Ashoka, the expansion of Buddhism and the synthesis of Brahmanic and non-Brahmanic religious traditions which converged in Hinduism. Minority religions such as Zoroastrianism and the Greek pantheon were respected.

==Legacy==

In the 20th century, diverging views on Chandragupta have developed between western academics and Indian scholars. While westerners tend to take a reserved view on his accomplishments, many Indian nationalists regard him as first Emperor of United India and first king with a vision of uniting India.

A memorial to Chandragupta exists on Chandragiri hill in Shravanabelagola, Karnataka. The Indian Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp honouring Chandragupta Maurya in 2001.

<text>Hoverflies, also called flower flies or syrphids, make up the insect family Syrphidae. As their common name suggests, they are often seen hovering or nectaring at flowers; the adults of many species feed mainly on nectar and pollen, while the larvae (maggots) eat a wide range of foods. In some species, the larvae are saprotrophs, specifically detritivores, eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams. In other species, the larvae are insectivores, preying on aphids, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects.

Insects such as aphids are considered crop pests, so the aphid-eating larvae of some hoverflies are economically and ecologically important. The larvae are potential agents for use in biological control, while the adults are pollinators.

About 6,000 species in 200 genera have been described. Hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on all continents except Antarctica. Hoverflies are harmless to most mammals, though many species are mimics of stinging wasps and bees, a mimicry which may serve to ward off predators.

Hoverfly hovering behavior is unlike that of hummingbirds since they do not feed in midair. Hovering in general may be a means of finding a food source. Male hovering is often a territorial display seeking females,
while female hovering serves to inspect ovipositing sites.


==Description==
The size of hoverflies varies depending on the species. For example &quot;Paragus tibialis&quot; is long, while &quot;Criorhina nigriventris&quot; is long. Some, such as members of the genus &quot;Baccha&quot;, are small, elongated, and slender, while others, such as members of &quot;Criorhina&quot;, are large, hairy, and yellow and black. As members of the Diptera, all hoverflies have a single functional pair of wings, with the hind wings reduced to balancing organs. Many species are brightly colored, with spots, stripes, and bands of yellow or brown covering their bodies. Due to this coloration, they are often mistaken both by insect-eating birds and by humans for wasps or bees; they exhibit Batesian mimicry. Despite this, hoverflies are harmless to humans. Drone flies, &quot;Eristalis tenax,&quot; are an example of a species of hoverfly who exhibit Batesian mimicry.

With a few exceptions, Hoverflies are distinguished from other flies by having a vein, located parallel to their fourth longitudinal wing vein. Adults feed mainly on nectar and pollen. Many species also hover around flowers, lending to their common name.

Bee flies of the family Bombyliidae often mimic Hymenoptera and hover around flowers, as well, rendering some bombyliid species hard to tell apart from Syrphidae at first glance. Hoverflies can, nevertheless, be distinguished in the field by anatomical features such as:
* The legs and mouthparts of hoverflies are usually not particularly long and thin (some bombyliids have a long and needle-like proboscis, many have legs that are noticeably longer and thinner than in similar-sized syrphids)
* Their facial cuticle often has prominent bulges and/or beak- to knob-like projections (most bee flies have an evenly curved or sloping face).
* The wings are often clear or have smooth gradients of tinting, and their veins merge posteriorly into a &quot;false edge&quot; that runs parallel to the wing&#x27;s true rear edge and extends along half or more of the wing length (bombyliid wings lack a &quot;false rear edge&quot; and often have large dark areas with sharp boundaries, or complex patterns of spots).
* Their abdomens and thoraces often have glossy cuticular body surfaces, abdominal colors are usually mainly due to cuticular pigments (bee flies are usually very hairy, their abdominal colors are almost always due to pigmentation of hairs and not the underlying cuticle).
== Reproduction and life cycle ==

Unlike adults, the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods. Some are saprotrophs, eating decaying plant or animal matter, while others are insectivores, eating aphids, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects. Predatory species are beneficial to farmers and gardeners, because aphids destroy crops, and hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control. That includes one of the most common widespread hoverfly species, &quot;Episyrphus balteatus&quot;, the larvae of which feed on aphids.

An example of a well-known hoverfly maggot is the rat-tailed maggot of the drone fly, &quot;Eristalis tenax&quot;. It has a breathing siphon at its rear end, giving it its name. The species lives in stagnant water, such as sewage and lagoons. The maggots also have a commercial use, and are sometimes sold for ice fishing.

Very rarely, hoverfly larvae have caused accidental myiasis in humans. That occurs when the larvae are accidentally ingested from contaminated food.

== Evolution ==
The oldest known fossils of crown group Syrphidae are from the Eocene aged Florissant Formation, Green River Formation and Baltic amber. The genus &quot;Prosyrphus&quot;, found in Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Burmese amber, appears to represent a stem group to the family.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Hoverflies are a cosmopolitan family found in most biomes, except extreme deserts, tundra at extremely high latitudes, and Antarctica. Certain species are more common in certain areas than others; for example, the American hoverfly, &quot;Eupeodes americanus&quot;, is common in the Nearctic realm, and the common hoverfly, &quot;Melangyna viridiceps&quot;, is common in the Australasian realm. About 6,000 species and 200 genera are in the family.

While some hoverfly larvae are aquatic and are often found in stagnant water, those of species that prey upon aphids and other plant parasites are usually terrestrial, residing on leaves. Adults are often found near flowers, their principal food source being nectar and pollen. Some species are inquilines; for instance, members of the genus &quot;Volucella&quot; can be found in bumblebee nests, while members of &quot;Microdon&quot; are myrmecophiles, found in ant or termite nests. Others can be found in decomposing vegetation.

==Pollination==

Hoverflies are important pollinators of flowering plants in many ecosystems worldwide. Syrphid flies are frequent flower visitors to a wide range of wild plants, as well as agricultural crops, and are often considered the second-most important group of pollinators after wild bees. Relatively little research into fly pollinators has been conducted, compared to bees. Bees are thought to be able to carry a greater volume of pollen on their bodies, but flies may be able to compensate for this by making a greater number of flower visits.

Like many pollinator groups, syrphid flies range from species that take a generalist approach to foraging by visiting a wide range of plant species through those that specialize in a narrow range of plants. Although hoverflies are often considered mainly nonselective pollinators, some hoverflies species are highly selective and carry pollen from one plant species. &quot;Cheilosia albitarsis&quot; is thought to only visit &quot;Ranunculus repens&quot;.

Specific flower preferences differ among species, but syrphid fly species have repeatedly been shown to prefer white- and yellow-coloured flowers. Nonvisual flower cues such as olfactory cues also help these flies to find flowers, especially those that are not yellow. Many syrphid fly species have short, unspecialized mouth parts and tend to feed on flowers that are more open as the nectar and pollen can be easily accessed.

Also, a number of interactions occur between orchids and hoverflies. The orchid species &quot;Epipactis veratrifolia&quot; mimics alarm pheromones of aphids which attracts pollinating hoverflies. Another plant, the slipper orchid in southwest China, also achieves pollination by deceit by exploiting the innate yellow color preference of syrphids.

==Systematics==

==Relationship with humans==

Adult syrphid flies are pollinators.

Larvae of many hoverfly species prey upon pest insects, including aphids and leafhoppers, which spread some diseases such as curly top, so they are seen in biocontrol as a natural means of reducing levels of pests. Gardeners, therefore, sometimes use companion plants to attract hoverflies. Those reputed to do so include &quot;Alyssum&quot; spp., &quot;Iberis umbellata&quot;, statice, buckwheat, chamomile, parsley, and yarrow. Many syrphids, such as &quot;Toxomerus marginatus&quot;, are attracted to herbivore-induced plant volatiles, and there are commercial formulations of said volatiles, like methyl salicylate, which can be used to attract them for biocontrol purposes. Larvae in the subfamily Eristalinae live in semi-aquatic and aquatic environments, including manure and compost, and can filter and purify water.

 book &quot;The Fly Trap&quot; concerns his enthusiasm for hoverflies on the island of Runmarö in the Baltic Sea. The island is a hotspot for hoverflies and other insects; Sjöberg has collected 58 species of butterflies there, and (in seven years of hunting) 202 species of hoverflies, including 180 in his garden.

<doc id="187739" wikidata="Q1762292" url="?curid=187739" title="Collaborative writing">
<text>Collaborative writing is a procedure in which two or more persons work together on a text of some kind (e.g., academic papers, reports, creative writing, projects, and business proposals). Success collaborative writing involves a division of labor that apportions particular tasks to those with particular strengths: drafting, providing feedback, editing, sourcing, (reorganizing), optimizing for tone or house style, etc. Collaborative writing is characteristic of professional as well as educational settings, utilizing the expertise of those involved in the collaboration process.

== Definition ==
Collaborative writing engages two or more persons in the process of producing a written work as a group, where everyone involved is contributing content or decisions on the work being produced (Vanderbilt University).
* Interaction between participants throughout the entire writing process. Whether it be brainstorming, writing a draft of the project, or reviewing.
* Shared power among participants. Everyone included in the project has the power to make decisions and no group member is in charge of all the text produced.
* The collaborative production of one single and specific text.

Collaborative writing is often the norm, rather than the exception, in many academic and workplace settings. Some theories of collaborative writing suggest that in the writing process, all participants are to have equal responsibilities. In this view, all sections of the text should be split up to ensure the workload is evenly displaced, all participants work together and interact throughout the writing process, everyone contributes to planning, generating ideas, making structure of text, editing, and the revision process. Other theories of collaborative writing propose a more flexible understanding of the workflow that accounts for varying contribution levels depending on the expertise, interest, and role of participants.

== History ==
In rhetoric, composition, and writing studies, scholars have demonstrated how collaborative learning in U.S. contexts has been informed by John Dewey&#x27;s progressivism in the early twentieth century. Collaboration and collaborative writing gained traction in these fields in the 1980s, especially as researchers reacted to poststructuralist theories related to social constructionism and began theorizing more social views of writing.

== Types ==

Collaborative writing processes are extremely context-dependent. In scholarship, on both academic and business writing, multiple terminologies have been identified for collaborative writing processes, including:

* Single-author writing or collegial: one person is leading, they compile the group ideas and do the writing.
* Sequential writing: each person adds their task work then passes it on for the next person to edit freely.
* Horizontal-division or parallel writing: each person does one part of the whole project and then one member compiles it.
* Stratified-division writing: each person plays a role in the composition process of a project due to talents.
* Reactive or reciprocal writing: group all works on and writes the project at the same time, adjusting and commenting on everyone&#x27;s work. 

The process of collaborative writing involves a couple of different levels. The process of collaborative writing begins with planning and goal setting. The group of two or more individuals meet and begin laying out the goals and steps they are going to take to complete the work. Next, members of the group will begin researching and finding information on the topic they are working on. After that, the group will begin outlining and structuring the research into a rough draft. Next, the group will collaborate to create a draft that they will then revise and edit. Finally, the group will begin proof-reading prior to publishing their work. With the draft, edited, proofread, and revised, the group will then publish the work they collaborated to create (UNC Writing Center, 2017). 

== Uses ==
Collaborative writing may be used in instances where a workload would be overwhelming for one person to produce. Therefore, ownership of the text is from the group that produced it and not just one person.

In 2012, Bill Tomlinson and colleagues provided the first extensive discussion of the experiential aspects of large-scale collaborative research by documenting the collaborative development process of an academic paper written by a collective of thirty authors; their work identifies key tools and techniques that would be necessary or useful to the writing process, and to discover, negotiate, and document issues in massively authored scholarship.

In 2016, Researchers Joy Robinson, Lisa Dusenberry, and Lawrence M. Halcyon conducted a case study investigating the productivity of a team of writers who utilized the practice of interlaced collaborative writing and found that the team was able to produce a published article, a two-year grant proposal, a digital and physical poster, a midterm research report, and conference presentation over the course of three years. The writers used virtual tools such as Google Hangouts&#x27; voice feature for group check-ins, to hold group discussions, and to write as a group. They used Google Docs to allow each team member to edit and add writing to a shared document throughout the writing process.

Another motive for using collaborative writing is to increase the quality of the completed project by combining the expertise of multiple individuals and for allowing feedback from diverse perspectives. Collaborative writing has been proven to be an effective method of improving an individual&#x27;s writing skills, regardless of their proficiency level, by allowing them to collaborate and learn from one or more partners and participate in the co-ownership of a written piece. Instructors may utilize this technique to create more student-centered and collaborative learning environments, or they may use it themselves to cross-collaborate with other academics to produce publishable works.

== Scholarly views ==
Linguist Neomy Storch, in a 2005 Australian study, discovered that reflections pertaining to collaborative writing in regards to second language learners in the classroom were overwhelmingly positive. The study compared the nature of collaborative writing of individual work versus that of group work, and Storch found that although paired groups wrote shorter texts, their work was more complex and accurate compared to individual works. The study consisted of 23 total participants: 5 doing individual work and 18 working in pairs. The pairs consisted of two male pairs, four female pairs and three male/female pairs. Post-assignment interviews revealed that the majority of students (16) yielded positive opinions about group work, but two students felt that group work is best reserved for oral activities and discussions rather than writing assignments. The majority of interviewees gave positive reviews, but one argued that group work was difficult when it came to criticizing another&#x27;s work and another argued that there is a power imbalance when writing is based on ability. The two students who were stark opponents of collaborative writing revealed that it was hard to concentrate on their work and they were embarrassed by their supposedly poor English skills.

Jason Palmeri found that when it came to inter-professional collaboration, most of the issues stemmed from miscommunication. In differing disciplines, one person may have a level of expertise and understanding that is foreign to another. Palmeri&#x27;s study provided the example of a nurse and an attorney having different areas of expertise, so therefore they had differing understanding of concepts and even the meaning of the same words. While many of the issues resulted from miscommunication, the study found that some nurse consultants resisted change in terms of altering their writing style to fit the understanding or standards of the attorneys.

Obstacles to collaborative work include a writers&#x27; inability to find time to meet with the rest of the group, personal preferences for organization and writing process, and a fear of being criticized.

== As an educational tool ==
Collaborative writing is an approach to writing that many educators use every day, it helps to improve writing skills by making students team up with one another to handle an assignment. Collaborative writing can make a big difference in students&#x27; writing because when working with others they will be forced to share ideas and writing styles with each other. The other thing about collaborative writing is the fact that it can be used in online schooling and in-person schooling, it is better in person though because it&#x27;s easier to communicate with each other and peer review one another. Collaborative writing can also improve confidence when talking to each other.

Research conducted by scholars about collaborative writing in education began in the early 1900s. Research discovered that language exchangers between peers to create these writings were beneficial and they called them language-related episodes. This is due to learners being able to socialize their language of choice and they were learning while discussing ideas, which allowed students to learn from each other. Worksheets tend to focus on language structures, while collaborative writing focuses more on the speech part of language. Collaborative writing also helps students to learn new writing styles such as analyzing writing. According to Vanderbilt University, &quot;Collaboration gives students practice in analyzing writing. It is easier to see where a classmate&#x27;s writing is going awry than it is to find flaws in one&#x27;s own prose&quot; (Vanderbilt University).

Grouping seems to be very important when it comes to collaborative writing, as larger groups tend to share more ideas whereas smaller groups share fewer ideas and tend to focus on grammar. Another way to have a strong collaborative writing process is to have good communication and division of roles. According to Campbell, &quot;it is helpful to ensure everyone knows their role. Sometimes, a project can get going, but many people do not know exactly who is responsible for what&quot; (Campbell 2023). Students also perform better face-to-face since there is more discussion. It is also discovered that students who are silent still benefit from collaborative writing by observing their peer&#x27;s writings.

Some students still may favor individual writing since the process is easier and less time-consuming. Students&#x27; opinions on collaborative writing may also be swayed by their experience, such as if team members delete or add text without discussion with their group, or some instructors are even concerned that group presentations allow weaker students to depend on stronger ones for success (Dartmouth). It is also stated that generally, students with more communication and discussions will have a positive view of collaborative writing.

== In the workplace ==
A study conducted by Stephen Bremner, an English professor at the City University of Hong Kong, investigated eight business communication textbooks to test the depth in which they provided students with a knowledge of collaborative writing in the workplace and how to execute those processes. The study found that, generally, textbooks highlighted the role of collaborative writing in the workplace. Textbooks listed the pros of collaborative writing such as saving time, more superior documents due to each individual&#x27;s strengths and specialized knowledge, a well-crafted message due to teamwork, balanced abilities, and an interest in accomplishing a common goal.

The textbooks examined gave students a basic knowledge of collaboration in the workplace, but they also lacked the information that showed students the realities of collaborative writing in the workplace with few activities presented in the textbooks that mirror collaborative activities in the workplace. Much of the activities that featured group work seemed more idealistic rather than based in reality, where the writing process occurred in only controlled and orderly environments. Bremner also found that group work in the classroom also did not properly simulate the power hierarchies present in the workplace.

Jason Palmeri found that when it came to inter-professional collaboration, most of the issues stemmed from miscommunication. In differing disciplines, one person may have a level of expertise and understanding that is foreign to another. The article gave the example of a nurse and an attorney having different areas of expertise, so therefore they had differing understanding of concepts and even the meaning of the same words. While much of the issues resulted from miscommunication, the article claimed that some nurse consultants resisted change in terms of altering their writing style to fit the understanding or standards of the attorneys.

== Benefits ==
The practice of collaborative writing offers numerous benefits that are accessible to individuals from all types of backgrounds. One of these advantages of collaboration in writing is that it frequently leads to a deeper and more comprehensive examination of the topic or subject matter under consideration due to these diverse perspectives. Collaboration enables individuals to combine their diverse perspectives, experiences, and areas of expertise. Collaborative writing brings together a diverse array of unique ideas and backgrounds, enriching the creative process. Also, through collaborative writing, tasks of an assignment can be assigned based on individual strengths, skills, and interests, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the writing process. For example, an individual proficient in research may be assigned to gather information, while another member of the team, skilled in editing, could concentrate on refining the draft. Through task assignment in this manner, every team member can contribute to the project in a manner that optimizes their abilities and interests, resulting in a writing process that is more efficient and effective.

While utilizing collaboration in writing practices can yield numerous advantages, the presence of additional factors, such as the learning environment, also influences the potential for a successful collaborative writing experience. A structured learning environment plays a crucial role in fostering critical thinking through writing, although it is equally important to equip students with the skills necessary for facilitating productive peer discussions, thereby promoting collaborative learning through writing. Students cannot be expected to achieve a satisfactory outcome in a collaborative writing project without a strong foundational understanding of the subject matter. A strong foundation might involve defining the writing&#x27;s purpose, identifying the intended audience, conducting thorough research on the topic, and structuring and organizing thoughts and concepts. Given adequate resources and education, the objective is for students to proficiently engage in writing tasks and feel at ease with collaborative efforts.

== Authorship ==

An author acquires copyright if their work meets certain criteria. In the case of works created by one person, typically, the first owner of a copyright in that work is the person who created the work, i.e. the author. But, when more than one person creates the work in collaboration with one another, then a case of joint authorship can be made provided some criteria are met.

<text>Amt is a type of administrative division governing a group of municipalities, today only in Germany, but formerly also common in other countries of Northern Europe. Its size and functions differ by country and the term is roughly equivalent to a British or U.S. county.

== Current usage ==
===Germany===

====Prevalence====
The &quot;Amt&quot; (plural: &quot;Ämter&quot;) is unique to the German &quot;Bundesländer&quot; (federal states) of Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg.

Other German states had this division in the past. Some states have similar administrative units called &quot;Samtgemeinde&quot; (Lower Saxony), &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; (Rhineland-Palatinate) or &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; (Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia).

====Definition====
An &quot;Amt&quot;, as well as the other above-mentioned units, is subordinate to a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) and is a collection of municipalities. The amt is lower than district-level government but higher than municipal government, and may be described as a supra-municipality or &quot;municipal confederation&quot;. Normally, it consists of very small municipalities (&quot;Gemeinden&quot;, plural of Gemeinde).

Larger municipalities do not belong to an &quot;Amt&quot; and are called &quot;amtsfreie Gemeinden&quot; (independent municipalities); some of these municipalities might also not be governed by or linked with a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) and are called &quot;kreisfreie Gemeinden&quot;, and when they do also not belong to any other &quot;Land&quot; they are also called &quot;Stadtstaaten&quot; (plural of &quot;Stadtstaat&quot;), i.e. city-states (Berlin and Hamburg).

These large municipalities (cities, in German &quot;Städte&quot;, plural of &quot;Stadt&quot;) may be further divided into local offices named &quot;Ortsämter&quot; (plural of &quot;Ortsamt&quot;), each of them possibly grouping several suburbs (or small townships in rural areas) of the municipality named &quot;Ortsteile&quot; (plural of &quot;Ortsteil&quot;), named from small villages or hamlets or localities. The &quot;Ortsteil&quot; (suburb or township) may have been a former parish, but today it is meant only for civil purpose and essentially used for planning within the municipality; the &quot;Ortsamt&quot; (sometimes just named informally but confusingly as an &quot;Amt&quot;, or informally translated as an &quot;urban district&quot;) is used to offer decentralized services of the municipality within local administrative offices for the residents in neighbouring suburbs. The &quot;Ortsteil&quot; itself may also be confusingly translated as a &quot;municipality&quot;, but it is incorrect because it belongs to a city which is the only effective municipality (&quot;Gemeinde&quot;).

==Former usage ==
===Denmark===


The &#x27; (plural, &#x27;; translated as &quot;county&quot;) was an administrative unit of Denmark (and, historically, of Denmark-Norway). The counties were established by royal decree in 1662 as replacements for the former fiefs (&#x27;). The &#x27; were originally composed of market towns (&quot;&quot;) and parishes, and held only small areas of responsibility. There were some changes to the borders of these counties over time, most notably when Roskilde County (da) was merged into Roskilde County (da) in 1808, and when Skanderborg County (da) was periodically merged into Århus County Skanderborg County (da). After Southern Jutland was returned to Denmark after the 1920 Schleswig plebiscites, four new counties were created in the area.

During the 20th century, the powers of the counties were expanded, when they were granted responsibility for the hospital service. The &quot;købstæder&quot;, which by this time had been separated from the counties and were overseen by the Interior Ministry, assumed the same responsibility. As the population became increasingly urbanized, and many rural communities came to rely on the hospital services of the &quot;købstader&quot; without paying taxes for them, it became evident that reform was necessary. In 1958, interior minister Søren Olesen set in motion administrative reforms that would culminate in 1970.

The municipal reform of 1 April 1970 reduced the number of counties to fourteen and eliminated the administrative distinction between (rural) parish and town. From then on, the &quot;amter&quot; were composed of a number of municipalities (&quot;&quot;). The reform granted the counties wider areas of responsibility, most notably running the national health service and the &quot;gymnasium&quot; secondary schools.

The municipal reform of 1 January 2007 abolished the &quot;amter&quot; and replaced them with five administrative regions, now mainly charged with running the national health service. In contrast to the &quot;amter&quot;, the regions hold no authority to levy taxes. The reform re-delegated all other areas of responsibility to either the municipalities or the state. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 270 to 98.

=== Germany ===
In Germany an &quot;Amt&quot; was a medieval administrative district covering a manorial estate or the land owned by a castle or village. It was headed by an &quot;Amtmann&quot;, usually a lesser nobleman or cleric, appointed by a territorial lord to administer and dispense justice within the &quot;Amt&quot;.

===Iceland===
While Iceland was a territory of the Danish-Norwegian realm, amts (singular: &#x27;; plural: &#x27;) were established in the country on top of the existing counties. From 1684 to 1770, Iceland as whole was a single amt in the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway but was then split into two amts: North and East Amt (&#x27;) and South and West Amt (&#x27;). The latter was in 1787 split into a West Amt (&#x27;) and South Amt (&#x27;). Iceland was thus divided into three amts until 1872, when the South and West amts were again merged. Amts were abolished in 1904, when Iceland gained home rule from Denmark.

Amts are not used to denote a geographical region in Iceland but the name lives on in the names of two public libraries in Iceland that were established during the amt era. The Amts libraries in Akureyri and Stykkishólmur which were established as the designated archives for the North and East Amt and the West Amt respectively.

===Netherlands and Flanders===
&quot;Ambacht&quot; can be seen as the Dutch equivalent to &quot;amt&quot;. &quot;Ambachten&quot; existed in Holland, Zeeland and Flanders up to about 1800.

===Norway===
From 1662 to 1919, the counties of Norway were called &quot;amter&quot;. They are now referred to as &quot;fylker&quot;, a term revived from the Middle Ages.

<text>This is a list of [[association football|soccer]] clubs in the United States. For clarity, teams based outside the United States that play in USSF-recognized leagues are also listed below with their home country noted.

Five professional leagues of men&#x27;s soccer teams are sanctioned by the Professional Division of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF or U.S. Soccer). The top-level men&#x27;s league is Major League Soccer (MLS) and the second level men&#x27;s league is the USL Championship. The third level men&#x27;s leagues are USL League One, the National Independent Soccer Association, and MLS Next Pro. At the semi-professional level, the USL League Two and the National Premier Soccer League have teams.

Two professional women&#x27;s soccer leagues are sanctioned by U.S. Soccer, both at the top level— the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL), which has operated since 2013, and the USL Super League (USLS), which started play in the 2024–25 season. While the NWSL and all professional men&#x27;s leagues (as of 2024) in the United States play in the summer, USLS plays in the winter, matching the international calendar. At the semi-professional level, the USL W League has teams.

<text>The McDonnell Douglas (later Boeing) MD-90 is a retired American five-abreast single-aisle airliner developed by McDonnell Douglas from its successful model MD-80. The airliner was produced by the developer company until 1997 and then by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was a stretched derivative of the MD-80 and thus part of the DC-9 family.

After the more fuel-efficient IAE V2500 high-bypass turbofan was selected, Delta Air Lines became the launch customer on November 14, 1989.
The MD-90 first flew on February 22, 1993, and the first delivery was in February 1995 to Delta.
The MD-90 competed with the Airbus A320ceo family and the Boeing 737 Next Generation.
Its 5 ft (1.4 m) longer fuselage seats 153 passengers in a mixed configuration over up to , making it the largest member of the DC-9 family. It kept the MD-88&#x27;s electronic flight instrument system (EFIS).

The shrunken derivative of MD-80 or shorter variant of MD-90, originally marketed as MD-95, was later renamed the Boeing 717 following McDonnell Douglas&#x27; merger with Boeing in 1997.

Production ended in 2000 after 116 deliveries. Delta Air Lines flew the final MD-90 passenger flight on June 2, 2020. It was briefly retired before being put into testing with Boeing Commercial Airplanes for the NASA X-66 program. 
It was involved in three hull-loss accidents with only one fatality being a fire related or &quot;non-aeronautical&quot; accident.

==Development==
The DC-9 series, the first generation of the DC-9 family with five members or variants (DC-9-10 / DC-9 Series 10, Series 20, Series 30, Series 40, and Series 50) and ten production versions (Series 11, Series 12, Series 14, Series 15, Series 21, Series 31, Series 32, Series 33, Series 34, Series 41, and Series 51), was a commercial success with 976 units built when production ended in 1982. The aircraft series was an all-new design, using two rear fuselage-mounted turbofan engines, a T-tail configuration, and a narrow-body fuselage design with five-abreast seating for 80 to 135 passengers. The success prompted the manufacturer to further develop the first generation DC-9 family into its second generation.

===Baseline: MD-80===
The MD-80 series, the first derivative or the second generation of the DC-9 family, entered service in 1980. The aircraft series was originally designated as Series 80 or stylized as the &quot;Super 80&quot;, which was a 14 ft 3 in (4.34 m) lengthened Series 50 with a higher maximum take-off weight (MTOW) and higher fuel capacity, as well as next-generation Pratt and Whitney JT8D-200 series engines and an improved wing design. The MD-80 series has five variants or production versions, which are designated with a non-zero second digit similar to the DC-9 series, the MD-81, MD-82, MD-83, MD-87, and the MD-88. A total of 1,191 MD-80 airliners were delivered from 1980 to 1999, making it the company&#x27;s most successful airliner model.
In 1983, McDonnell Douglas began studies on derivatives of the MD-80 series or the third generation of the DC-9 family, which later became known as the MD-90 series.

===Stretching: MD-90===

The MD-90, the stretched derivative of the MD-80 and thus the third generation of the DC-9 family, was launched on November 14, 1989 when Delta Air Lines placed an order for 50 MD-90s, with options to purchase a further 110 aircraft. The type was 57-inch-longer (1.4 m) longer than MD-80 and featured a glass cockpit (electronic instrumentation) and more powerful, quieter, fuel-efficient IAE V2525-D5 engines, with the option of upgrading to an IAE V2528 engine.

====Large stretch: MD-90X====
Starting in late 1986, McDonnell Douglas began offering the MD-90X, a stretch of the MD-80. Unlike the MD-91 and MD-92 derivatives and the clean-sheet MD-94X proposal, the MD-90X would still use turbofan engines. The MD-90X would carry 180 passengers. Powered by the CFM56-5 or V2500, the MD-90X replaced the MD-89 as McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s proposed new turbofan offering, and it was designed to compete with the Boeing 757.

====Propfan engine====
=====Civilian: MD-94X=====


For several years, McDonnell Douglas proposed powering the MD-90 with two unducted fan (UDF) or propfan engines, designated the MD-94X. Previously, an MD-81 was used as a testbed for propfan engines, such as the General Electric GE36 and the Pratt &amp; Whitney/Allison 578-DX.

By mid-1989, it was clear that there was insufficient interest in propfan-powered aircraft, so the company reworked its proposals to instead feature the IAE V2500 turbofan, which was estimated to be $1 million cheaper than the GE36 and had already been certified for the Airbus A320. Within six weeks of eliminating the propfan option, the MD-90 secured a large launch order.

=====Military: P-9D=====
When the United States Navy wanted to replace its 125 Lockheed P-3 Orion anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, McDonnell Douglas offered the P-9D, which would be a propfan-powered version of the MD-91. The thrust engine would be either the General Electric GE36 or the Pratt &amp; Whitney/Allison 578-DX. Lockheed won the competition with its P-3 derivative, the Lockheed P-7, but the replacement program was later canceled.

===Shrinking: MD-95===

In 1991, McDonnell Douglas revealed that it was again considering developing a specialized 100-seat version of the MD-80, to be some shorter than the MD-87, powered with engines in the thrust class. At the Paris Airshow, McDonnell Douglas announced the development of a 105-seat version of the MD-80, designated &quot;MD-95&quot;. In early 1994, the MD-95 re-emerged as similar to the DC-9-30, its specified weight, dimensions, and fuel capacity being almost identical. Major changes included a fuselage &quot;shrink&quot; back to length (same as the DC-9-30), and the reversion to the original DC-9 wingspan of . At this time, McDonnell Douglas said that it expected the MD-95 to become a family of aircraft with the capability of increased range and seating capacity.

The MD-95 was developed to satisfy the market need to replace early DC-9s, then approaching 30 years old. The MD-95 was a complete overhaul, going back to the original DC-9-30 design and applying new engines, cockpit and other more modern systems. McDonnell Douglas first offered the MD-95 for sale in 1994. The airliner was later renamed the Boeing 717-200 after McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997.

===Early operations===
The type first flew on February 22, 1993, and the first MD-90 was delivered to Delta in February 1995.
No MD-90 orders were received after Boeing and McDonnell Douglas merged in 1997 due to internal competition with Boeing&#x27;s 737. Delta Air Lines had initially placed a large order for the MD-90 to replace some aging Boeing 727s. After the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger, Delta canceled their remaining 19 MD-90 orders in favor of the Boeing 737–800.

===Production===
The MD-90 was produced adjacent to the Long Beach Airport in Long Beach, California, USA. A total of 40 MD-90s (later 20) were to be assembled under contract in Shanghai, People&#x27;s Republic of China under the Trunkliner program, but Boeing&#x27;s decision to phase out the MD-90 resulted in only two built by Shanghai Aircraft. MD-90 production at Long Beach, California ended in 2000 with the last airplane being delivered to Saudi Arabian Airlines, and MD-90T production at Shanghai ended in 2000. With 116 MD-90 aircraft produced, the MD-90 production run was the smallest among the DC-9 family. Two aircraft were also produced at Jiangwan Airfield in Shanghai, People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Retirement===
The main competitors of the MD-90 included the Airbus A320ceo and the Boeing 737-800. Aeronautical Engineers Inc (AEI) planned to begin an MD-90 freighter conversion program in 2016/2017 when the 737-400SF conversions were expected to be phased out, but canceled it in 2015. A converted MD-90 freighter would be longer than a 12-pallet capacity MD-80SF and would have one more pallet position, or 13 pallets total. However, as with the MD-80SF, the narrow fuselage cross-section only allows for non-standard 88&quot; x 108&quot; pallets or containers, which is the main disadvantage in cargo operations and limits its potential market. The main reason for AEI&#x27;s decision not to continue the 13-pallet freighter program was the limited availability of MD-90 in the market. At the time, fewer than 100 aircraft were still active, most of which were in Delta Air Lines fleet. On June 2, 2020, Delta operated its last MD-90 on the type&#x27;s final commercial flights, and so the MD-90 was retired without a freighter conversion to extend its service life.
==Design==

The MD-90 is a mid-size, medium-range airliner that was developed from the MD-80 series. Resembling the preliminary version of the MD-88 from March 1984, the MD-90 is a , updated version of the base MD-80 with similar electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and more powerful, quieter and fuel efficient IAE V2500 engines instead of the JT8D engines, which power the MD-80 series. This made the MD-90 the first derivative variant of the DC-9 to use a high-bypass turbofan engine. Due to the heavier engines, the engine pylons feature flaps that deflect 30° downward to assist in pitching down for stall recovery. The system activates automatically when the control column is pushed fully forward.

Typical seating for the MD-90 ranges from 153 to 172 passengers, depending on the cabin configuration and interior layout. The MD-90 was produced in two versions: -30 and −30ER. The −30 has a range of . The −30ER has a higher gross weight and range up to with an extra 565 US gal (2,140 L) auxiliary fuel tank. An even longer-range version, the −50, was offered but was never ordered.

The initial MD-90s feature an EFIS cockpit similar to the MD-88&#x27;s cockpit. The 29 MD-90s delivered to Saudi Arabian Airlines feature a full glass cockpit with avionics and an overhead display panel similar to the MD-11&#x27;s cockpit for easy transition for the airline&#x27;s pilots of the MD-11, also operated by the airline.

==Variants==

===Production variants===
;MD-90-30: Base variant with two V2525-D5 or V2528-D5 engines and an EFIS cockpit similar to that of the MD-88. V2528-D5 engines also has an option to select between 25K or 28K ratings if needed by activating a switch in the flight deck.
;MD-90-30IGW: Increased Gross Weight version, one built.
;MD-90-30ER: Extended Range (ER) version of MD-90-30, two built.
;MD-90-30T &quot;Trunkliner&quot;: Variant of the MD-90-30 assembled by Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corporation in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Production was initially planned to be 40, later reduced to 20, with only two built in the end. To accommodate the heavy aircraft on unsuitable runways, a dual tandem landing gear with more tires to spread the weight of the aircraft was designed for the Trunkliner, but ultimately not used in the two aircraft produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boeing-MD-80/90&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Comac ARJ21 is built using tooling retained by the Chinese after the end of the Chinese MD-90-30 program.
;MD-90-30EFD: Enhanced Flight Deck version of MD-90 with similar instrumentation to the MD-11, 28 built.

===Proposed variants===
;MD-90-10: A shorter variant with the same length as the MD-87, carrying from 114 passengers in a three-class layout to 139 passengers in a high-density configuration. It has a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of and a range of with fuel reserves. Engine thrust would be . This variant was not built.
;MD-90-10EC: Unbuilt &quot;European Community&quot; version of the MD-90-10, with a higher MTOW and the engine thrust raised to MD-90-30 levels for an increased range of .
;MD-90-20: Proposed re-engining of MD-80 series aircraft to V2500 engines.

;MD-90-30EC: Unbuilt &quot;European Community&quot; version of the MD-90-30, with a higher MTOW and the engine thrust raised to MD-90-40 levels for an increased range of .
;MD-90-40: A proposed variant with a maximum capacity of up to 217 passengers, though the normal three-class layout would hold 170–180 passengers. The derivative would have a storage capacity of , a maximum takeoff weight of , and a height of . Engine thrust would be . This variant was never built.
;MD-90-40EC: Unbuilt &quot;European Community&quot; version of the MD-90-40, with a higher MTOW for an increased range of . Other improvements include wing area enlargement/strengthening, adoption of MD-11 avionics, one-person baggage loading improvements, and better interiors.
;MD-90-50ER:A proposed variant similar to the MD-90-30, but with two extra auxiliary fuel tanks mounted on the belly. The aircraft had an MTOW of , used IAE V2528 engines with thrust, and had an estimated range of .
;MD-90-55: A proposed variant with two extra passenger doors and room for 187 passengers in a single-class configuration.

==Operators==

There are no longer any MD-90 aircraft in service as Delta Air Lines was the last remaining operator in 2020. They began phasing out its MD-90s in 2017, before retiring its remaining MD-90s after their final flights on June 2, 2020.

===Deliveries===
==Accidents and incidents==

During its service life, the MD-90 was involved in three hull-loss accidents, resulting in one fatality.

* On August 24, 1999, Uni Air Flight 873, an MD-90, caught fire after a passenger&#x27;s carry-on luggage containing gasoline was ignited by a motorcycle battery contained in another passenger&#x27;s carry-on luggage. 27 people were injured with one fatality as a result of the cabin fire. The aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair.
*On February 23, 2009, a Lion Air MD-90 with 156 passengers and 6 crew members, performing flight JT-972 from Medan to Batam in Indonesia, could not extend the nose gear while on approach to runway 04 of Batam&#x27;s Hang Nadim International Airport. The crew aborted the approach and circled the airport while trying to troubleshoot the problem. After around one hour, they were forced to land without the nose gear at around 18:30 local time (11:30GMT). The airport’s emergency services had sprayed foam on the runway for the landing, which the crew performed safely.
*On March 9, 2009, a Lion Air MD-90 overran runway 25L at Soekarno–Hatta International Airport, due to an unstable approach 330 ft (100 m) before the runway in rainfall and strong winds, in which the aircraft touched down to the left of the centerline. Although its thrust reversers were functioning, it veered to the right, resulting in the aircraft resting 90 degrees off the runway.
*On May 8, 2009, a Saudi Arabian Airlines MD-90 with seven crew members and no passengers on a repositioning flight from Jeddah was substantially damaged during a runway excursion at Riyadh airport. On touchdown, the captain manually extended the speed brake (spoiler) lever, but did not latch it in the fully extended (EXT) position (fully aft and latched upwards), and the lever automatically returned to the forward retracted (RET) position which was not noticed by the cockpit crew. After touchdown, the aircraft banked to the right and began to drift right of the runway center line and left the runway at high speed, traversed the full width of the G4 taxiway, where the left main landing gear collapsed during this time. The aircraft came to rest on taxiway GOLF and all crew members escaped with no injuries.
