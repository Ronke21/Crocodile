<text>The European nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), common goatsucker, Eurasian nightjar or just nightjar is a crepuscular and nocturnal bird in the nightjar family that breeds across most of Europe and the Palearctic to Mongolia and Northwestern China. The Latin generic name refers to the old myth that the nocturnal nightjar suckled from goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six subspecies differ clinally, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards the east of the range. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.

The preferred habitat is dry, open country with some trees and small bushes, such as heaths, forest clearings or newly planted woodland. The male European nightjar occupies a territory in spring and advertises his presence with a distinctive sustained churring trill from a perch. He patrols his territory with wings held in a V and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Wing clapping also occurs when the male chases the female in a spiralling display flight. The European nightjar does not build a nest, and its two grey and brown blotched eggs are laid directly on the ground; they hatch after about 17–21 days and the downy chicks fledge in another 16–17 days.

The European nightjar feeds on a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a perch. It hunts by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. Its eyes are relatively large, each with a reflective layer, which improves night vision. It appears not to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not echolocate. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.

==Taxonomy==
The nightjars, Caprimulgidae, are a large family of mostly nocturnal insect-eating birds. The largest and most widespread genus is &quot;Caprimulgus&quot;, characterised by stiff bristles around the mouth, long pointed wings, a comb-like middle claw and patterned plumage. The males, and sometimes females, often have white markings in the wing or tail. Within the genus, the European nightjar forms a superspecies with the rufous-cheeked nightjar and the sombre nightjar, African species with similar songs. It is replaced further east in Asia by the jungle nightjar which occupies similar habitat.

The European nightjar was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current scientific name. &quot;Caprimulgus&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;capra&quot;, &quot;nanny goat&quot;, and &quot;mulgere&quot;, &quot;to milk&quot;, referring to an old myth that nightjars suck milk from goats, and the species name, &quot;europaeus&quot; is Latin for &quot;European&quot;. The common name &quot;nightjar&quot;, first recorded in 1630, refers to the nocturnal habits of the bird, the second part of the name deriving from the distinctive churring song. Old or local names refer to the song, &quot;churn owl&quot;, habitat, &quot;fern owl&quot;, or diet, &quot;dor hawk&quot; and &quot;moth hawk&quot;.

===Subspecies===
There are six recognised subspecies, although the differences are mainly clinal; birds become smaller and paler in the east of the range and the males have larger white wing spots. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the subspecies&#x27; ranges overlap.
The fossil record is deficient, but it is likely that these poorly defined subspecies diverged as global temperature rose over the last 10,000 years or so. Only one record of the species possibly dates back to the late Eocene.

== Description ==

The European nightjar is long, with a wingspan. The male weighs and the female . The adult of the nominate subspecies has greyish-brown upperparts with dark streaking, a pale buff hindneck collar and a white moustachial line. The closed wing is grey with buff spotting, and the underparts are greyish-brown, with brown barring and buff spots. The bill is blackish, the iris is dark brown and the legs and feet are brown.

The flight on long pointed wings is noiseless, due to their soft plumage, and very buoyant. Flying birds can be sexed since the male has a white wing patch across three primary feathers and white tips to the two outer tail feathers, whereas females do not show any white in flight. Chicks have downy brown and buff plumage, and the fledged young are similar in appearance to the adult female. Adults moult their body feathers from June onwards after breeding, suspend the process while migrating, and replace the tail and flight feathers on the wintering grounds. Moult is completed between January and March. Immature birds follow a similar moult strategy to the adults unless they are from late broods, in which case the entire moult may take place in Africa.

Other nightjar species occur in parts of the breeding and wintering ranges. The red-necked nightjar breeds in Iberia and northwest Africa; it is larger, greyer and longer winged than the European nightjar, and has a broad buff collar and more conspicuous white markings on the wings and tail. Wintering European nightjars in Africa may overlap with the related rufous-cheeked and sombre nightjars. Both have a more prominent buff hind-neck collar and more spotting on the wing coverts. The sombre nightjar is also much darker than its European cousin. Given their nocturnal habits, cryptic plumage and difficulty of observation, nightjar observation &quot;is as much a matter of fortune as effort or knowledge&quot;.

=== Voice ===
The male European nightjar&#x27;s song is a sustained churring trill, given continuously for up to 10 minutes with occasional shifts of speed or pitch. It is delivered from a perch, and the male may move around its territory using different song posts. Singing is more frequent at dawn and dusk than during the night, and is reduced in poor weather. The song may end with a bubbling trill and wing-clapping, perhaps indicating the approach of a female. Migrating or wintering birds sometimes sing. Individual male nightjars can be identified by analysing the rate and length of the pulses in their songs. Even a singing male may be hard to locate; the perched bird is difficult to spot in low light conditions, and the song has a ventriloquial quality as the singer turns his head. The song is easily audible at , and can be heard at in good conditions; it can be confused with the very similar sound of the European mole cricket.

The female does not sing, but when on the wing, both sexes give a short &#x27; call, also used when chasing predators. Other calls include variations on a sharp &quot;chuck&quot; when alarmed, hisses given by adults when handled or chicks when disturbed, and an assortment of &#x27;, muffled &quot;oak, oak&quot; and murmurs given at the nest. Large young have a threat display with the mouth opened wide while hissing loudly.

Despite the name, wing-clapping does not involve contact between the two wing tips over the bird&#x27;s back as was once thought. The sound is produced in a whiplash-like way as each wing cracks down.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The breeding range of the European nightjar comprises Europe north to around latitude 64°N and Asia north to about 60°N and east to Lake Baikal and eastern Mongolia. The southern limits are northwestern Africa, Iraq, Iran and the northwestern Himalayas. This nightjar formerly bred in Syria and Lebanon.

All populations are migratory, and most birds winter in Africa south of the Sahara, with just a few records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East Africa. Some Asian birds may therefore cross 100° of longitude on their travels. Most birds start their migration at the time of a full moon.

Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or &quot;C. e. meridionalis&quot;. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent tracking data has revealed that European nightjars have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial Africa where they have to cross several ecological barriers (the Mediterranean Sea, the Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar stop-over sites as do other European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.

The European nightjar is a bird of dry, open country with some trees and small bushes, such as heaths, commons, moorland, forest clearings or felled or newly planted woodland. When breeding, it avoids treeless or heavily wooded areas, cities, mountains, and farmland, but it often feeds over wetlands, cultivation or gardens. In winter it uses a wider range of open habitats including acacia steppe, sandy country and highlands. It has been recorded at altitudes of on the breeding grounds and in the wintering areas.

==Behaviour==

The European nightjar is crepuscular and nocturnal. During the day it rests on the ground, often in a partly shaded location, or perches motionless lengthwise along an open branch or a similar low perch. The cryptic plumage makes it difficult to see in the daytime, and birds on the ground, if they are not already in shade, will turn occasionally to face the sun thereby minimising their shadow. If it feels threatened, the nightjar flattens itself to the ground with eyes almost closed, flying only when the intruder is away. It may call or wing clap as it goes, and land as far as from where it was flushed. In the wintering area it often roosts on the ground but also uses tree branches up to high. Roost sites at both the breeding and wintering grounds are used regularly if they are undisturbed, sometimes for weeks at a time.

Like other nightjars, it will sit on roads or paths during the night and hover to investigate large intruders such as deer or humans. It may be mobbed by birds while there is still light, and by bats, other nightjar species or Eurasian woodcocks during the night. Owls and other predators such as red foxes will be mobbed by both male and female European nightjars. Like other aerial birds, such as swifts and swallows, nightjars make a quick plunge into water to wash. They have a unique serrated comb-like structure on the middle claw, which is used to preen and perhaps to remove parasites.

In cold or inclement weather, several nightjar species can slow their metabolism and go into torpor, notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks. The European nightjar has been observed in captivity to be able to maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown.

=== Breeding ===
Breeding is normally from late May to August, but may be significantly earlier in northwest Africa or western Pakistan. Returning males arrive about two weeks before the females and establish territories which they patrol with wings held in a V-shape and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Fights may take place in flight or on the ground. The male&#x27;s display flight involves a similar wing and tail position with frequent wing clapping as he follows the female in a rising spiral. If she lands, he continues to display with bobbing and fluttering until the female spreads her wings and tail for copulation. Mating occasionally takes place on a raised perch instead of the ground. In good habitat, there may be 20 pairs per square kilometre (50 per square mile).

The European nightjar is normally monogamous. There is no nest, and the eggs are laid on the ground among plants or tree roots, or beneath a bush or tree. The site may be bare ground, leaf litter or pine needles, and is used for a number of years. The clutch is usually one or two whitish eggs, rarely unmarked, but normally blotched with browns and greys. The eggs average and weigh , of which 6% is shell.

Several nightjar species are known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.

Eggs are laid 36–48 hours apart, and incubation, mainly by the female, starts with the first egg. The male may incubate for short periods, especially around dawn or dusk, but spends the day roosting, sometimes outside his territory or close to other males. If the female is disturbed while breeding, she runs or flutters along the ground feigning injury until she has drawn the intruder away. She may also move the eggs a short distance with her bill. Each egg hatches after about 17–21 days. The semi-precocial downy chicks are mobile when hatched, but are brooded to keep them warm. They fledge in 16–17 days and become independent of the adults around 32 days after hatching. A second brood may be raised by early nesting pairs, in which case the female leaves the first brood a few days before they fledge; the male then cares for the first brood and assists with the second. Both adults feed the young with balls of insects which are either regurgitated into the chick&#x27;s mouth or pecked by the chick from the adult&#x27;s open bill.

Broods that fail tend to do so during incubation. One English study showed that only 14.5% of eggs survived to hatching, but once that stage was reached the chances of fledging successfully were high. European nightjars breed when aged one year, and typically live four years. The adult annual survival rate is 70%, but that for juveniles is unknown. The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12 years.

=== Feeding ===

The European nightjar feeds on a wide variety of flying insects, including moths, beetles, mantises, dragonflies, cockroaches and flies. It will pick glowworms off vegetation. It consumes grit to aid with digesting its prey, but any plant material and non-flying invertebrates consumed are taken inadvertently while hunting other food items. Young chicks have been known to eat their own faeces.

Birds hunt over open habitats and woodland clearings and edges, and may be attracted to insects concentrating around artificial lights, near farm animals or over stagnant ponds. They usually feed at night, but occasionally venture out on overcast days. Nightjars pursue insects with a light twisting flight, or flycatch from a perch; they may rarely take prey off the ground. They drink by dipping to the water surface as they fly. Breeding European nightjars travel on average from their nests to feed. Migrating birds live off their fat reserves.

European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting their prey against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly continuously on darker nights when prey is harder to see; Tracking experiments show that feeding activity more than doubles on moonlit nights. Hunting frequency reduces in the middle of the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets. They often hunt around herds, especially herds of livestock including goats, sheep and cattle. These animals attract huge amounts of haematophagous insects.

Nightjars have relatively large eyes, each with a tapetum lucidum (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light areas and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision at the expense of colour discrimination In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.

== Predators and parasites ==
The eggs and chicks of this ground-nesting bird are vulnerable to predation by red foxes, pine martens, European hedgehogs, least weasels and domestic dogs, and by birds including crows, Eurasian magpies, Eurasian jays and owls. Snakes, such as common adders, may also rob the nest. Adults may be caught by birds of prey including northern goshawks, hen harriers, Eurasian sparrowhawks, common buzzards, peregrines and sooty falcons.

Parasites recorded on the European nightjar include a single species of biting louse found on the wings, and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite &quot;L. caprimulgi&quot; is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity and the fact that it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.

==Status==
The global population of the European nightjar in 2020 was estimated at 3–6 million birds, and estimates of the European population ranged from 290,000 to 830,000 individuals. Although there appeared to be a fall in numbers, it is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The huge breeding range and population mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.

The largest breeding populations as of 2012 were in Russia (up to 500,000 pairs), Spain (112,000 pairs) and Belarus (60,000 pairs). There have been declines in much of the range, but especially in northwestern Europe. The loss of insect prey through pesticide use, coupled with disturbance, collision with vehicles and habitat loss have contributed to the falling population. As ground-nesting birds, they are adversely affected by disturbance, especially by domestic dogs, which may destroy the nest or advertise its presence to crows or predatory mammals. Breeding success is higher in areas with no public access; where access is permitted, and particularly where dog owners allow their pets to run loose, successful nests tend to be far from footpaths or human habitation.

In Britain and elsewhere, commercial forestry has created new habitat which has increased numbers, but these gains are likely to be temporary as the woodland develops and becomes unsuitable for nightjars. In the United Kingdom, it is red-listed as a cause for concern, and in Ireland it was close to extinction as of 2012.

== In culture ==
Poets sometimes use the nightjar as an indicator of warm summer nights, as in George Meredith&#x27;s &quot;Love in the Valley&quot;;

&lt;poem&gt;Lone on the fir-branch, his rattle-notes unvaried
Brooding o&#x27;er the gloom, spins the brown eve-jar&lt;/poem&gt;

Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Calm is the fragrant air&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;The busy dor-hawk chases the white moth
With burring note.&lt;/poem&gt;

or Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Fern Hill&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;and all the night long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars
flying with the ricks&lt;/poem&gt;

Nightjars sing only when perched, and Thomas Hardy referenced the eerie silence of a hunting bird in &quot;Afterwards&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;If it be in the dusk when, like an eyelid&#x27;s soundless blink
The dewfall-hawk comes crossing the shades to alight
Upon the wind-warped upland thorn.&lt;/poem&gt;

In the final track on Divers, &quot;Time, As a Symptom&quot;, Joanna Newsom rounds out the album with a litany of:

&lt;poem&gt;No time, no flock, no chime, no clock, no end
White star, white ship, Nightjar, transmit, transcend (joy)
White star, white ship, Nightjar, transmit, transcend (we go down)
White star, white ship, Nightjar, transmit, transcend
White star, white ship, Nightjar, transmit, tran- [birdsong]&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;Caprimulgus&quot; and the old name &quot;goatsucker&quot; both refer to the myth, old even in the time of Aristotle, that nightjars suckled from nanny goats, which subsequently ceased to give milk or went blind. This ancient belief is reflected in nightjar names in other European languages, such as German &quot;Ziegenmelker&quot;, Polish &quot;kozodój&quot; and Italian &quot;succiacapre&quot;, which also mean goatsucker, but despite its antiquity, it has no equivalents in Arab, Chinese or Hindu traditions. The birds are attracted by insects around domestic animals and, as unusual nocturnal creatures, were then blamed for any misfortune that befell the beast. Another old name, &quot;puckeridge&quot;, was used to refer to both the bird and a disease of farm animals, the latter actually caused by botfly larvae under the skin. &quot;Lich fowl&quot; (corpse bird) is an old name which reflects the superstitions that surrounded this strange nocturnal bird. Like &quot;gabble ratchet&quot; (corpse hound), it may refer to the belief that the souls of unbaptised children were doomed to wander in nightjar form until Judgement Day.

<doc id="195657" wikidata="Q1383992" url="?curid=195657" title="Kjell Inge Røkke">
<text>Kjell Inge Røkke (born October 25, 1958) is a Norwegian billionaire businessman. He is the chairman of the Norwegian-based company Aker ASA, and holds directorships in Aker BP, Kværner, Ocean Yield, Aker BioMarine and Aker Energy. As of December 31st 2018, Røkke owned 68.2% of the shares in Aker ASA through his investment company, TRG AS, and its subsidiaries. 

In 2018, he was considered the richest person in Norway, with a fortune estimated at NOK 20.6 billion, (approximately US$2.4 billion).

== Career ==
Røkke began his career as a fisherman at the age of 18, without any secondary or higher education. In 1979, he moved to the United States to work on trawlers in Alaska, saving enough money to buy his first vessels. He eventually became the owner of American Seafoods Group. 

During the 1980s, Røkke was based in Seattle, Washington, where he owned and operated American Seafoods and Resource Group International (RGI), which included brands like Brooks Sports and Helly Hansen. In the mid-1990s, he returned to Norway. In 1996, Røkke became Aker ASA&#x27;s main shareholder when RGI acquired enough shares to become its largest shareholder; the two companies subsequently merged, completing the merger in January 1997. Through Aker, Røkke gained a significant position in the fisheries sector and acquired the well-established fishery business J.M. Johansen, which dates back to 1876. The new company portfolio also included real estate and shipyards.

Røkke is currently the largest shareholder of Aker ASA, an industrial investment company, which interests are concentrated in the oil and gas, maritime assets and marine biotechnology sectors. The company&#x27;s industrial holdings include Aker BP, Aker Solutions, Akastor, Kværner, Ocean Yield, Aker Energy, Cognite, and Aker BioMarine. Its financial investments comprise cash, liquid assets, and real estate development projects.

In an interview with the Norwegian newspaper (published 1 May 2017) Røkke said he planned to give away most of his fortune. As a further step in this plan, he joined the Giving Pledge in 2017 and founded the REV Ocean initiative. REV Ocean, led by former WWF Norway CEO, Nina Jensen, works to improve understanding of the ocean and foster solutions through three initiatives: the world&#x27;s largest research and expedition vessel (&quot;REV Ocean&quot;), the World Ocean Headquarters, and an open, global data platform. A 183m research and expedition vessel, the &quot;REV&quot; &quot;Ocean&quot;, is due for final delivery to Røkke in 2022. The world&#x27;s longest superyacht, it is reported to have three swimming-pools and a 35-seat auditorium.

Røkke suffers from dyslexia but claims that it has contributed to his success, and states that he would not be where he is today without it.

Røkke has been described by &quot;Forbes&quot; as having &quot;built up a reputation as a ruthless corporate raider&quot;.

In 2005, Røkke was selected to the top manager in Norway by &quot;Dagens Næringsliv&quot;. Among the 18 nominees, Røkke received nearly 1/3 of the votes.

In 2006, Røkke won the “Peer Gynt of the Year” award. The prize is given every year to a person or institution that has distinguished him- or herself within Norway and have improved Norway&#x27;s international reputation. Members of the Peer Gynt Festival itself, parliamentary representatives and former winners of the year&#x27;s Peer Gynt prize may propose candidates for the award.

== Donations ==
In May 2017, Røkke and his wife joined the Gates-Buffett The Giving Pledge, an elite network of big philanthropic givers. Pledge members promise to devote the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes during their lifetimes or after their death.

In May 2017, Røkke announced that he is funding the purchase of the world&#x27;s largest and most advanced research vessel, the &quot;REV Ocean&quot;. The 182.9-meter-long vessel was initially launched in 2019 but is scheduled to be completed in 2024. Equipment on board the research ship enables researchers to take measurements from the atmosphere as well as 6,000 meters below the surface of the sea – including up to 20 meters under the seabed. Submarines and both under and overwater drones can be attached to the research vessel, which houses an auditorium and seven laboratories. The ship is able to collect and incinerate up to five tonnes of plastic every day without releasing any harmful emissions. Røkke&#x27;s desire to use his fortune to benefit society lies behind the idea to fund the ship. Røkke also told &quot;Aftenposten&quot; that he was concerned about both climate change and plastic pollution in the seas, but that his passion for science was one of the key elements in his funding the project. The research expedition vessel will be available for expeditions and research as well as for hire as a private yacht, according to the report. Income will be used to reduce maintenance costs and help fund research and equipment costs. Røkke is paying for the construction and operation of a research vessel that will have a crew of 30 and accommodate 60 researchers. The boat was built at a Romanian shipyard of Italian yacht builder Fincantieri.

Together with his wife, Anne Grete Eidsvig, Røkke has established the Aker Scholarship in partnership with Aker ASA to support Norwegian students&#x27; graduate studies at internationally leading universities. Aker Scholarship&#x27;s objective is to inspire recipients to make a difference in the development of Norwegian business, industry, and society. Røkke&#x27;s family&#x27;s company, TRG, finances Aker Scholarships through donations to their Foundation of Education; Aker ASA administers the scholarship program. The purpose of the Aker Scholarship is to offer highly qualified candidates, with a strong link to Norway, an opportunity to pursue an advanced degree at a high-level university, and to support the development of the scholar&#x27;s social commitment.

In 2018, Røkke and TRG, along with the other Aker companies, founded Stiftelsen VI (The VI Foundation). Røkke&#x27;s privately owned company, TRG, provided the foundation&#x27;s starting capital of NOK 25 million. Stiftelsen VI aspires to become a resource and competence centre for disabled people&#x27;s opportunities and rights, and create equal opportunities to perform. Amongst other things, VI wants to inspire and motivate to physical activity. Aker ASA, Aker-owned companies and Kjell Inge Røkke&#x27;s private company TRG have committed to a contribution of NOK 125 million over the next five years.

In 2017, Røkke gave a donation to the family&#x27;s local soccer club, Frisk Asker, to fund new artificial turf and a new clubhouse. Røkke has previously given NOK 10 million (approx US$1.19 million) to fund 20 mini-pitches for local sports teams and housing associations in his home municipality, Asker. When Røkke and his family moved to Asker in 2010, he helped finance a walking and cycling route in the area.

==Personal life==
Røkke is married, with four children, and lives in Vettre, Norway. He is known for having several exclusive cars, including a Ford GT acquired in August 2016. In September 2022, he announced that he is moving to Lugano, Switzerland, hoping to dodge some Norwegian taxes.

==Football==
Røkke is also known for his involvement in football, and became involved with Norwegian club Molde FK in 1993. He was also central to the funding of the club&#x27;s new stadium, which got the nickname &quot;Røkkeløkka&quot; (English: &quot;The Røkke Park&quot;). Some estimates suggest that he has spent about NOK 400 million funding the club.

Røkke, along with his former business partner Bjørn Rune Gjelsten, also bought into Wimbledon Football Club in the late 1990s, becoming a joint owner of the team in 2000. The following year, with the club homeless since leaving their Plough Lane ground in 1991 and playing at Crystal Palace&#x27;s Selhurst Park stadium in Croydon, southeast London, Røkke and Gjelsten, along with chairman Charles Koppel and businessman Pete Winkelman agreed to relocate the team from London to Milton Keynes, a town around 60 miles from their traditional base. The move was controversial and sparked a year of protest at matches from Wimbledon fans, determined not to let their club be &#x27;franchised&#x27;. Although common in American sport, the relocation of a professional English football club had never been done before. After rejections from the Football League and The FA, the decision was eventually passed on to a three-man arbitration panel, the outcome being two to one in favour of the move. Wimbledon fans, outraged with the decision, agreed to form a new club to support, AFC Wimbledon, and declared a boycott on their former team. The following season, Wimbledon FC would go on to play in front of record low crowds, including just 664 for a League Cup game against Rotherham, before finally completing the move in September 2003. It renamed itself a year later, adopting the name Milton Keynes Dons.

==Boat license conviction==
In 2005, Røkke was convicted of bribery and license fraud after paying a Swedish official to issue skipper&#x27;s licenses to Røkke himself, his butler, and a Norwegian ship broker. The skipper&#x27;s license came into focus after Røkke&#x27;s yacht, the &quot;Celina Bella&quot;, ran aground near Strömstad in 2001. Røkke eventually served 24–25 days in jail of a 120-day prison and probation sentence, before being released on parole.

<text>Movement Electronic Music Festival is an annual electronic dance music event held in the birthplace of Techno, Detroit, each Memorial Day weekend since 2006. Previous electronic music festivals held at Hart Plaza on Memorial Day weekend include Detroit Electronic Music Festival (2000–2002), Movement (2003–2004) and Fuse-In (2005). The four different festival names reflect completely separate and distinct producers, brands and directions. All of these festivals presented performances by musicians and DJs that emphasized the progressive qualities of the culture surrounding electronic music including the celebration of Detroit being the birthplace of the popular electronic music subgenre Techno.

In late 2013, the original DEMF management announced plans for the return of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival as a free-admission event at Campus Martius Park on Independence Day weekend, 2014, along with the paid-admission Federation of Electronic Music Technology (FEMT), a concurrent conference and music showcase at Ford Field. These events were later rescheduled for 2015. These events are not connected to the Movement Electronic Music Festival planned for Memorial Day weekend in Hart Plaza.

In 2017, Movement was nominated for Festival of the Year at the Electronic Music Awards.

Movement is scheduled to return on May 24–26, 2025 at Hart Plaza.

== History ==
=== 2000 ===
The first electronic music festival held in Detroit was the Detroit Electronic Music Festival in 2000, produced by Carol Marvin and her organization Pop Culture Media (which included event producer Adriel Thornton, Telo Dunne and Barbara Deyo and others). It took place in Detroit&#x27;s Hart Plaza. The event was one of the first electronic music festivals in the United States. 

=== 2001 ===
Ford Motor Company provided $435,000 for title sponsorship of the 2001 event, which was renamed the Focus Detroit Electronic Music Festival. This allowed the free-of-charge event to continue to be a gift to the fans and made the festival a profitable venture in its second year. Festival producer Pop Culture Media, with Carol Marvin at the helm, worked with Ford to create a nationwide television ad campaign featuring the music of Detroit Techno founder Juan Atkins. Controversy ensued when producer Carol Marvin reluctantly fired artistic director Carl Craig for breach of contract. 

=== 2003 ===
In January 2003, Detroit city Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick decided to override the Recreation Department (which controls and manages Hart Plaza) and secured Hart Plaza and the Memorial Day weekend dates for Derrick May, who had extensive experience as a touring DJ but no firsthand, large-scale festival production experience. May put a first-class team in place, which included a donation by Philadelphia-based P.A.W.N. LASERS / Louis Capet XXVI, but the biggest hurdle faced by the Festival was the City of Detroit&#x27;s withdrawal of $350,000 funding that it had provided in previous years.

=== 2004 ===
The second Movement festival took place in 2004, but despite its public success, the event faced significant financial losses and its fate became uncertain.

=== 2005 ===
In February 2005, May announced his resignation as festival producer, and the festival once again changed hands. Fellow techno veteran Kevin Saunderson announced plans for a Movement replacement to be called Fuse-In Detroit (later shortened to just Fuse-In, with the tagline &quot;Detroit&#x27;s Electronic Movement&quot;) to be staged Memorial Day Weekend 2005.

Successful negotiations with city officials led to 2005 becoming the first year that an event in Hart Plaza did not have free admission. A total of 41,220 admission passes were sold to Fuse-In visitors. 38,382 daily passes were sold for $10 each, and 2,838 weekend passes, covering the full three days, were sold for $25 each. The City of Detroit collected $1 per pass, and was to have collected 30% of festival profits, but admission pass sales did not recoup the festival&#x27;s $756,000 budget.

=== 2006 ===
On February 16, 2006, Kevin Saunderson announced that due to financial losses and lack of sufficient promotion, he would not continue to produce the festival in 2006. As of March 23, Paxahau of Detroit, Michigan, an event production company that has worked with Craig, May, and Saunderson, secured the venue and dates from Saunderson to produce the festival under the name &quot;Movement.&quot; Paxahau has been producing their festival from 2006 to present.

=== 2007 ===

In 2007 the festival took place over a span of three days, May 26-May 28, 2007.

=== 2008 ===
In 2008 the festival took place over a three-day span, May 24-May 26, 2008. Ticket prices this year were set at $40 presale or $55 at the door for a weekend pass, and $175 for a VIP Pass.

=== 2009 ===

Movement 2009 took place from Saturday, May 23, 2009, thru Monday, May 25, 2009, in Hart Plaza in Detroit, Michigan.
These two mobile friendly sites include information about after parties, lodging and an easy to read schedule
 The weekend overlapped with CouchSurfing&#x27;s event CouchCrash, and with the International Sword fighting and Martial Arts Convention.

=== 2010 ===
Movement 2010 took place May 29–31, 2010. This was the 10th anniversary of Detroit&#x27;s yearly electronic music festival. Plastikman confirmed his appearance on his website. Other confirmed artists include Mr. Scruff, Ida Engberg, Jamie Jones, and Woody McBride.

=== 2011 ===
Movement 2011 was held on May 28–30, 2011 and took place at Hart Plaza in Detroit, Michigan; the same location as every year since its inception. Featured artists this year include Fatboy Slim, Carl Craig, Beardyman, Felix da Housecat, and Skrillex. This year&#x27;s &quot;secret artist&quot; listed on the lineup is Ricardo Villalobos, who, to the disappointment of many, was not allowed entrance into the US last year.

=== 2012 ===
Movement 2012 was held on May 26–28, 2012 at Hart Plaza in Detroit, Michigan; the same location as every year since its inception.

===2013===
Movement 2013 took place on May 25–27 in Hart Plaza. The lineup for the 2013 edition of the festival includes the following 116 acts:

===2014===
Movement 2014 took place on May 24–26 in Hart Plaza. The lineup for the 2014 edition of the festival included the following 121 acts:
J. Phlip closed out Movement 2014 on the Beatport Stage after a last minute cancellation of the originally booked artist.

<doc id="195666" wikidata="Q1156860" url="?curid=195666" title="Derailleur">
<text>A derailleur () is a variable-ratio bicycle gearing system consisting of a chain, multiple sprockets of different sizes, and a mechanism to move the chain from one sprocket to another. 

Modern front and rear derailleurs typically consist of a moveable chain-guide that is operated remotely by a Bowden cable attached to a shifter mounted on the down tube, handlebar stem, or handlebar. When a rider operates the lever while pedalling, the change in cable tension moves the chain-guide from side to side, &quot;derailing&quot; the chain onto different sprockets.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Dérailleur&quot; () is a French word, derived from the derailment of a train from its tracks. Its first recorded use was 1930.

== History ==
Various derailleur systems were designed and built in the late 19th century. One example is the Protean two-speed derailleur available on the Whippet safety bicycle. The French bicycle tourist, writer and cycling promoter Paul de Vivie (1853–1930), who wrote under the name &quot;Vélocio&quot;, invented a two speed rear derailleur in 1905 which he used on forays into the Alps.
Some early designs used rods to move the chain onto various gears. 1928 saw the introduction of the &quot;Super Champion Gear&quot; (or &quot;Osgear&quot;) from the company founded by champion cyclist Oscar Egg, as well as the Vittoria Margherita* both employed chainstay mounted &#x27;paddles&#x27; and single lever chain tensioners mounted near or on the downtube. However, these systems, along with the rod-operated Campagnolo Cambio Corsa were eventually superseded by &quot;parallelogram derailleurs&quot;.

In 1937, the derailleur system was introduced to the Tour de France, allowing riders to change gears without having to remove wheels. Previously, riders would have to dismount in order to change their wheel from downhill to uphill mode. Derailleurs did not become common road racing equipment until 1938 when Simplex introduced a cable-shifted derailleur.

In 1949 Campagnolo introduced the Gran Sport, a more refined version of the already existing, yet less commercially successful, cable-operated parallelogram rear derailleurs.

In 1964, Suntour invented the &quot;slant-parallelogram&quot; rear derailleur, which let the jockey pulley maintain a more constant distance from the different sized sprockets, resulting in easier shifting. Once the patents expired, other manufacturers adopted this design, at least for their better models, and the &quot;slant parallelogram&quot; remains the current rear derailleur pattern.

Before the 1990s many manufacturers made derailleurs, including Simplex, Huret, Galli, Mavic, Gipiemme, Zeus, Suntour, and Shimano. However, the successful introduction and promotion of indexed shifting by Shimano in 1985 required a compatible system of shift levers, derailleur, sprockets, chainrings, chain, shift cable, and shift housing.

The major innovations since the 1990s have been the switch from friction to indexed shifting and the gradual increase in the number of gears. With friction shifting, a lever directly controls the continuously variable position of the derailleur. To shift gears, the rider first moves the lever enough for the chain to jump to the next sprocket, and then adjusts the lever a slight amount to center the chain on that sprocket. An indexed shifter has a detent or ratchet mechanism which stops the gear lever, and hence the cable and the derailleur, after moving a specific distance with each press or pull. Indexed shifters require re-calibration when cables stretch and parts get damaged or swapped. On racing bicycles, 10-gear rear cassettes appeared in 2000, and 11-gear cassettes appeared in 2009. Most current mountain bicycles have either. Many modern, high-end mountain bikes have begun using entirely one chain ring drivetrains, with the industry constantly pushing the number of rear cogs up and up, as shown by SRAM&#x27;s Eagle groupsets (1 by 12) and Rotor&#x27;s recent 1 by 13 drive-train. Most road bicycles have two chainrings, and touring bicycles commonly have three.

An electronic gear-shifting system enables riders to shift with electronic switches instead of using conventional control levers. The switches are connected by wire or wirelessly to a battery pack and to a small electric motor that drives the derailleur. Although expensive, an electronic system could save a racing cyclist time when changing gears.

The three main manufacturers of derailleurs are Shimano (Japan), SRAM (USA), and Campagnolo (Italy).

== Rear derailleurs ==


The rear derailleur has two functions: it moves the chain between rear sprockets while taking up chain slack caused by moving to a smaller sprocket at the rear or a smaller chainring by the front derailleur. In order to accomplish this second task, it is positioned in the path of the bottom, slack portion of chain. Sometimes the rear derailleurs are re-purposed as chain tensioners for single-speed bicycles that cannot adjust chain tension by a different method.

Although variations exist, most rear derailleurs have several components in common. They have a cage that holds two pulleys that guide the chain in an S-shaped pattern. The pulleys are known as the jockey pulley or guide pulley (top) and the tension pulley (bottom). The cage rotates in its plane and is spring-loaded to take up chain slack. The cage is positioned under the desired sprocket by an arm that can swing back and forth under the sprockets. The arm is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. The other end of the arm mounts to a pivot point attached to the bicycle frame. The arm pivots about this point to maintain the cage at a nearly constant distance from the different sized sprockets. There may be one or more adjustment screws that control the amount of lateral travel allowed and the spring tension.

The components may be constructed of aluminium alloy, steel, plastic, or carbon fibre composite. The pivot points may be bushings or ball bearings. These will require moderate lubrication.

=== Relaxed position ===
High normal or top normal rear derailleurs return the chain to the smallest sprocket on the cassette when no cable tension is applied. This is the regular pattern used on most Shimano mountain, all Shimano road, and all SRAM and Campagnolo derailleurs. In this condition, spring pressure takes care of the easier change to smaller sprockets. In road racing, the swiftest gear changes are required on the sprints to the finish line. Therefore high-normal types, which allow a quick change to a higher gear, remain the preference.

Low normal or rapid rise rear derailleurs return the chain to the largest sprocket on the cassette when no cable tension is applied. While this was once a common design for rear derailleurs, it has become relatively uncommon. In mountain biking and off-road cycling, the most critical gear changes occur on uphill sections, where riders must cope with obstacles and difficult turns while pedalling under heavy load. This derailleur type provides an advantage over high normal derailleurs because gear changes to lower gears occur in the direction of the loaded spring, making these shifts easier during high load pedalling.

=== Cage length ===
The distance between the upper and lower pulleys of a rear derailleur is known as the cage length. Cage length, when combined with the pulley size, determines the capacity of a derailleur to take up chain slack. Cage length determines the total capacity of the derailleur, that is the size difference between the largest and smallest chainrings, and the size difference between the largest and smallest sprockets on the cogset added together. A larger sum requires a longer cage length. Typical cross country mountain bikes with three front chainrings will use a long cage rear derailleur. A road bike with only two front chainrings and close ratio sprockets can operate with either a short or long cage derailleur, but will work better with a short cage.

Manufacturer stated derailleur capacities are as follows:

* Shimano: long = 45T*, medium = 33T
* SRAM: long = 43T*, medium = 37T*, short = 30T

Benefits of a shorter cage length:

* more positive gear-changing due to less flex in the parallelogram
* better gear-changing with good cable leverage
* better obstruction clearance
* less danger of catching spokes.
* slight weight savings.

=== Cage positioning ===
There are at least two methods employed by rear derailleurs to maintain the appropriate gap between the upper jockey wheel and the rear sprockets as the derailleur moves between the large sprockets and the small sprockets. One method, used by Shimano, is to use chain tension to pivot the cage. This has the advantage of working with most sets of sprockets, if the chain has the proper length. A disadvantage is that rapid shifts from small sprockets to large over multiple sprockets at once can cause the cage to strike the sprockets before the chain moves onto the larger sprockets and pivots the cage as necessary. Another method, used by SRAM, is to design the spacing into the parallelogram mechanism of the derailleur itself. The advantage is that no amount of rapid, multi-sprocket shifting can cause the cage to strike the sprockets. The disadvantage is that there are limited options for sprocket sizes that can be used with a particular derailleur.

=== Actuation and shift ratios ===

The actuation ratio is the ratio between the amount of shifter cable length and the amount of transverse derailleur travel that it generates. Shift ratio is the reciprocal of actuation ratio and is more easily expressed for derailleurs than actuation. There are currently several standards in use, and in each the product of the derailleur&#x27;s shift ratio and the length of cable pulled must equal the pitch of the rear sprockets. The following standards exist.

* The Shimano compatible family of derailleurs is stated as having a shift ratio of &quot;two-to-one&quot; (2:1), and since SRAM makes two families of components, the term has been widely adopted to distinguish it from SRAM&#x27;s own &quot;one-to-one&quot; (1:1) ratio family of derailleurs. Notice that these &quot;family&quot; names do not give the exact shift ratios: the 2:1 shift ratio is in fact about 1.7 (Or 1.9 on the Dura Ace series up to 7400) rather than 2, and the native SRAM shift ratio is about 1.1. The family names of these standards are reversed by some in actuation ratio notation as opposed to that of the more common shift ratio. Thus, in Shimano systems a unit of cable shifted causes about twice as much movement of the derailleur.
* The native SRAM convention is called &quot;one-to-one&quot; (1:1). These have actual shift ratios of 1.1. A unit of cable retracted at the shifter causes about an equal amount of movement in the derailleur. SRAM claims that standard makes their systems more robust: more resistant to the effects of contamination. Some SRAM shifters are made to be 2:1 Shimano-compatible, but these clearly will not work with SRAM&#x27;s 1:1 derailleurs.
* The Campagnolo convention. The shift ratios are 1.5 for modern units but their old units had 1.4 ratios.
* The Suntour&#x27;s convention.

Shifters employing one convention are generally not compatible with derailleurs employing another, although exceptions exist, and adaptors are available.
=== Clutch ===
Some rear derailleurs, especially for mountain bikes, incorporate a clutch to keep the lower length of chain in sufficient tension to prevent the chain from striking the bottom of the chain stay: this is called &quot;chain slap&quot; and can damage the chain stay. Clutches are also helpful in preventing the chain from derailing from the chain ring on systems without a front derailleur.

== Front derailleurs ==


The front derailleur only has to move the chain side to side between the front chainrings, but it has to do this with the top, taut portion of the chain. It also needs to accommodate large differences in chainring size: from as many as 53 teeth to as few as 20 teeth.

As with the rear derailleur, the front derailleur has a cage through which the chain passes. On a properly adjusted derailleur, the chain will only touch the cage while shifting. The cage is held in place by a movable arm which is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. There are usually two adjustment screws controlling the limits of lateral travel allowed. The components may be constructed of aluminium alloy, steel, plastic, or carbon fibre composite. The pivot points are usually bushings, and these will require lubrication.

; Cable pull types:
* Bottom pull: Commonly used on road and touring bikes, this type of derailleur is actuated by a cable pulling downwards. The cable is often routed across the top or along the bottom of the bottom bracket shell on a cable guide, which redirects the cable up the lower edge of the frame&#x27;s down tube. Full-suspension mountain bikes often have bottom pull routing as the rear suspension prevents routing via the top tube.
* Top pull: This type is more commonly seen on mountain bikes without rear-suspension. The derailleur is actuated by a cable pulling upwards, which is usually routed along the frame&#x27;s top tube, using cable stops and a short length of housing to change the cable&#x27;s direction. This arrangement keeps the cable away from the underside of the bottom bracket/down tube which get pelted with dirt when off-road.
* Dual pull: There are some derailleurs available that have provisions for either top pull or bottom pull, and can be used in either application.

; Cage types:
* Double (Standard): These are intended to be used with cranksets having two chainrings. When viewed from the side of the bicycle, the inner and outer plates of the cage have roughly the same profile.
* Triple (Alpine): Derailleurs designed to be used with cranksets having three chainrings, or with two chainrings that differ greatly in size. When viewed from the side of the bicycle, the inner cage plate extends further towards the bottom bracket&#x27;s center of rotation than the outer cage plate does. This is to help shift the chain from the smallest ring onto the middle ring more easily.

; Swing types:
* Bottom swing: The derailleur cage is mounted to the bottom of the four-bar linkage that carries it. This is the most common type of derailleur.
* Top swing: The derailleur cage is mounted to the top of the four-bar linkage that carries it. This alternate arrangement was created as a way to get the frame clamp of the derailleur closer to the bottom bracket to be able to clear larger suspension components and allow different frame shapes. The compact construction of a top swing derailleur can cause it to be less robust than its bottom swing counterpart. Top swing derailleurs are typically only used in applications where a bottom swing derailleur will not fit. An alternative solution would be to use an E-type front derailleur, which does not clamp around the seat tube at all.

; Mount types:
* Clamp: Until recently, most front derailleurs are mounted to the frame by a clamp around the frame&#x27;s seat tube, and this style is still the standard on mountain bikes and is common on road bikes. Derailleurs are available with several different clamp diameters designed to fit different types of frame tubing. Recently, there has been a trend to make derailleurs with only one diameter clamp, and several sets of shims are included to space the clamp down to the appropriate size.
* Braze-on: An alternative to the clamp is the braze-on derailleur hanger, where the derailleur is mounted by bolting a tab on the derailleur to a corresponding tab on the frame&#x27;s seat tube. This avoids any clamp size issues, but requires either a frame with the appropriate braze-on, or an adapter clamp that simulates a braze-on derailleur tab. These have become common on newer road bikes, as carbon frames no longer have a round seat tube. They are rarely seen on mountain bikes.
* E-type: This type front derailleurs do not clamp around the frame&#x27;s seat tube, but instead are attached to the frame by a plate mounted under the drive side bottom bracket cup and a screw threaded into a boss on the seat tube. These derailleurs are usually found on mountain bikes with rear suspension components that do not allow space for a normal derailleur&#x27;s clamp to go around the seat tube.
* DMD: Direct-Mount-Derailleur — Initiated by Specialized Bicycles, this type of derailleur is bolted directly to bosses on the chainstay of the bike. They are mostly used on dual suspension mountain bikes, where suspension movement causes changes to the chain angle as it enters the front derailleur cage. By utilizing a DMD system, the chain and derailleur move together, allowing for better shifting when the suspension is active. A DMD derailleur should not be confused with Shimano&#x27;s Direct Mount, which uses a different mounting system. However, SRAM&#x27;s direct mount front derailleurs are compatible with DMD, and certain Shimano E-type derailleurs can be used with DMD if the e-type plate is removed.

Because of the possibility of the chain shifting past the smallest inner chainring, especially when the inner chainring is very small, even on bikes adjusted by professional race mechanics, and the problems such misshifts can cause, a small after-market of add-on products, called chain deflectors, exists to help prevent them from occurring. Some clamp around the seat tube, below the front derailleur, and at least one attaches to the front derailleur mount.

== Use ==

Derailleurs require the chain to be in movement in order to shift from one ring or sprocket to another. This usually requires the rider to be pedalling, but some systems have been developed with the freewheel in the crankset so that the chain moves even when the rider is not pedalling. The Shimano FFS (Front Freewheel System) circa 1980 was the most widespread such system.

Chain-drive systems such as the derailleur systems work best if the chain is aligned with the sprocket plane, especially avoiding the biggest drive sprocket running with the biggest driven sprocket (or the smallest with the smallest). The diagonal chain run produced by these practices is less efficient and shortens the life of all components, with no advantage from the middle of the range ratio obtained.

Derailleur gears generally have an efficiency around 95%, a few percentage points higher than other gear types.

<text>Leslie B. Lamport (born February 7, 1941) is an American computer scientist and mathematician. Lamport is best known for his seminal work in distributed systems, and as the initial developer of the document preparation system LaTeX and the author of its first manual.

Lamport was the winner of the 2013 Turing Award for imposing clear, well-defined coherence on the seemingly chaotic behavior of distributed computing systems, in which several autonomous computers communicate with each other by passing messages. He devised important algorithms and developed formal modeling and verification protocols that improve the quality of real distributed systems. These contributions have resulted in improved correctness, performance, and reliability of computer systems.

==Early life and education==
Lamport was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Benjamin and Hannah Lamport (née Lasser). His father was an immigrant from Volkovisk in the Russian Empire (now Vawkavysk, Belarus) and his mother was an immigrant from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now southeastern Poland.

A graduate of Bronx High School of Science, Lamport received a B.S. in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1960, followed by M.A. (1963) and Ph.D. (1972) degrees in mathematics from Brandeis University. His dissertation, &quot;The analytic Cauchy problem with singular data&quot;, is about singularities in analytic partial differential equations.

==Career and research==
Lamport worked as a computer scientist at Massachusetts Computer Associates from 1970 to 1977, Stanford Research Institute (SRI International) from 1977 to 1985, and Digital Equipment Corporation and Compaq from 1985 to 2001. In 2001 he joined Microsoft Research in California, and he retired in January 2025.

===Distributed systems===
Lamport&#x27;s research contributions have laid the foundations of the theory of distributed systems. Among his most notable papers are
* &quot;Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System&quot;, which received the Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC) Influential Paper Award in 2000,
* &quot;How to Make a Multiprocessor Computer That Correctly Executes Multiprocess Programs&quot;, which defined the notion of sequential consistency,
* &quot;The Byzantine Generals&#x27; Problem&quot;,
* &quot;Distributed Snapshots: Determining Global States of a Distributed System&quot; and
* &quot;The Part-Time Parliament&quot;.
These papers relate to such concepts as logical clocks (and the &quot;happened-before&quot; relationship) and Byzantine failures. They are among the most cited papers in the field of computer science, and describe algorithms to solve many fundamental problems in distributed systems, including:
* the Paxos algorithm for consensus,
* the bakery algorithm for mutual exclusion of multiple threads in a computer system that require the same resources at the same time,
* the Chandy–Lamport algorithm for the determination of consistent global states (snapshot), and
* the Lamport signature, one of the prototypes of the digital signature.

===LaTeX===
When Donald Knuth began issuing the early releases of TeX in the early 1980s, Lamport — due to his personal need of writing a book — also began working on a set of macros based on it, hoping that it would later become its standard macro package. This set of macros would later become known as LaTeX, for which Lamport would subsequently be approached in 1983 by Peter Gordon, an Addison-Wesley editor, who proposed that Lamport turn its user manual into a book.

In September 1984, Lamport released version 2.06a of the LaTeX macros, and in August 1985, LaTeX 2.09 — the last version of Lamport&#x27;s LaTeX — would be released as well. Meanwhile, Addison-Wesley released Lamport&#x27;s first LaTeX user manual, &quot;LaTeX: A Document Preparation System&quot;, in 1986, which purportedly sold &quot;more than a few hundred thousands&quot; copies, and on August 21, 1989, at a TeX User Group meeting at Stanford, Lamport would agree to turn over the maintenance and development of LaTeX to Frank Mittelbach, who, along with Chris Rowley and Rainer Schöpf, would form the LaTeX3 team, subsequently releasing LaTeX 2e, the current version of LaTeX, in 1994.

===Temporal logic===
Lamport is also known for his work on temporal logic, where he introduced the temporal logic of actions (TLA). Among his more recent contributions is TLA+, a language for specifying and reasoning about concurrent and reactive systems, which he describes in the book &quot;Specifying Systems: The TLA+ Language and Tools for Hardware and Software Engineers.&quot; He defines TLA+ as a &quot;quixotic attempt to overcome engineers&#x27; antipathy towards mathematics&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
Lamport received the 2013 Turing Award for &quot;fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of distributed and concurrent systems, notably the invention of concepts such as causality and logical clocks, safety and liveness, replicated state machines, and sequential consistency&quot;, which can be used in synchronizing the systems. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1991 for contributions to the theoretical foundations of concurrent and fault-tolerant computing. He was elected to Fellow of Association for Computing Machinery for fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of distributed and concurrent systems in 2014. He also received five honorary doctorates from European universities: University of Rennes and Christian Albrechts University of Kiel in 2003, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2004, University of Lugano in 2006, and Nancy-Université in 2007. In 2004, he received the IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award. In 2005, the paper &quot;Reaching Agreement in the Presence of Faults&quot; received the Dijkstra Prize. In honor of Lamport&#x27;s sixtieth birthday, a lecture series was organized at the 20th Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC 2001). In 2008, he received the IEEE John von Neumann Medal. In 2011, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

<text>Weustenrade is a hamlet in the municipality of Voerendaal of the province Limburg, Netherlands. It is located near Hoensbroek, Voerendaal and Klimmen. 

The village was first mentioned in 1420 as Woestenroede, and means &quot;desolate cultivated forest&quot;. It was home to 105 people in 1840.

There are still several old seventeenth-century houses, among which the &#x27;oliemolen&#x27; (oilmill).

He was a leader of the radical &quot;Hébertistes&quot; of the revolution, an ardent critic of Christianity who was one of the leaders of the dechristianization of France. His radical positions resulted in his alienation from Maximilien Robespierre, and he was arrested and executed.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Chaumette was born in Nevers, France, on 24 May 1763 into a family of shoemakers who wanted him to enter the Church. However, he did not have a vocation and instead sought his fortune as a cabin boy. After only reaching the rank of helmsman, he returned to Nevers to study his main interests, botany and science. He also studied surgery and made a long voyage in the company of an English doctor, serving as his secretary. He then became surgeon at the Frères de la charité in Moulins. Chaumette studied medicine at the University of Paris in 1790, but gave up his career in medicine at the start of the Revolution. Chaumette began his political career as member of the Jacobin Club editing the progressive &quot;Revolutions de Paris&quot; journal from 1790. His oratory skills proved him a valuable spokesperson of the Cordelier Club, and more importantly, the sans-culotte movement in the Paris sections.

===Presidency of the Commune===
In August 1792, Chaumette became the Chief Procurator of the Commune of Paris. As member of the Commune during the insurrection of 10 August 1792, he was delegated to visit the prisons, with full power to arrest suspects. On 31 October 1792, he was elected President of the Commune and was re-elected in the Municipal on 2 December of that same year.

His conduct, oratorical talent, and the fact that his private life was considered beyond reproach, all made him influential, and he was elected president of the Commune, defending the municipality at the bar of the National Convention on 31 October 1792. Re-elected in the municipal elections of 2 December 1792, he was soon given the functions of &quot;procureur&quot; of the Commune, and contributed with success to the enrollments of volunteers in the army by his appeals to the population of Paris. Chaumette held strong anti-monarchy views. He led a deputation from the Commune and argued before the National Convention that failing to punish Louis XVI for his crimes was causing high prices and the fall of the assignat. Further, Chaumette held a strong opinion about the fate of Louis XVI after his fall. He was greatly outspoken in his demand for the king&#x27;s blood. Chaumette&#x27;s thesis was that as long as Louis XVI went unpunished prices would remain high, and shortages and the profiteering that created them, which he assumed to be the work of the royalists, would go unchecked.

Chaumette was also a leading and vocal opponent of the Girondins. He was one of the instigators of their downfall in mid-1793. Chaumette and Jacques Hébert acted as prosecutors on behalf of the Tribunal which tried the Girondists in October 1793.

Chaumette made a leading contribution to establishing the Reign of Terror. In early September 1793 there was fear and unrest in Paris over prices, food shortages, war and fears of a royalist betrayal. On 4 September Hebert appealed to the sections to join the Commune in petitioning the National Convention with radical demands. The next day, led by Chaumette and the mayor of Paris, Pache, crowds of citizens filled the Convention. Chaumette stood up on a table to declare that &quot;we now have open war between the rich and the poor&quot; and urged the immediate mobilisation of the revolutionary army to go into the countryside, seize food supplies from hoarders and exact punishments on them. Robespierre was presiding over the Convention&#x27;s sessions that day, and Chaumette&#x27;s demands, together with the shock of the recent betrayal of Toulon to the British, prompted the Convention to decree that &#x27;Terror will be the order of the day&#x27;.

Despite his social radicalism in other regards, Chaumette was a virulent opponent of women&#x27;s participation in the Revolution. He believed women had to remain excluded from all involvement in public life, instead devoting themselves to the household. During a November 1793 meeting of the Commune, he harshly chastized a group of female attendees: &quot;Since when is it permitted to renounce one&#x27;s sex? (...) Is it for women to make motions? Is it for women to put themselves at the head of our armies?&quot; He further cautioned the women by reminding them of the recently executed Madame Roland and Olympe de Gouges, describing such politically active women as &quot;haughty&quot;, &quot;denatured&quot; and &quot;shameless&quot;.

===Role in the dechristianization of France===
Chaumette is considered one of the ultra-radical &quot;enragés&quot; of the French Revolution. He demanded the formation of a Revolutionary Army which was to &quot;force avarice and greed to yield up the riches of the earth&quot; in order to redistribute wealth, and feed troops and the urban populations. However, he is much more known today for his role in the dechristianization movement. Chaumette was an ardent critic of Christianity, which he considered &quot;ridiculous ideas&quot; that &quot;have been very helpful to [legitimize] despotism.&quot; His views were heavily influenced by atheist and materialist writers Paul d&#x27;Holbach, Denis Diderot and Jean Meslier. Chaumette saw religion as a relic of superstitious eras that did not reflect the intellectual achievements of the Age of Enlightenment. Indeed, for Chaumette, &quot;church and counterrevolution were one and the same.&quot; Thus, he proceeded to pressure several priests and bishops into abjuring their positions.

Chaumette organized a Festival of Reason on 10 November 1793, which boasted a Goddess of Reason, portrayed by an actress, on an elevated platform in the Notre Dame Cathedral. He was such a passionate opponent of Christianity that in December 1792, he even publicly changed his name from Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette to Anaxagoras Chaumette, explaining: &quot;I was formerly called Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette because my god-father believed in the saints. Since the revolution I have taken the name of a saint who was hanged for his republican principles.&quot; It has been suggested by Daniel Guérin that his criticism was also influenced by the Church&#x27;s stance on homosexual relations.

===Downfall===
Chaumette&#x27;s ultra-radical ideas on the economy, society and religion set him at odds with Maximilien Robespierre, the powerful circle around him and other &quot;moderate&quot; Montagnards. Soon, official opinion began to turn against Chaumette and the like-minded Hébertists. In September 1793, Robespierre, who was a Deist, made a speech denouncing dechristianisation as aristocratic and immoral. Fabre d&#x27;Églantine, himself under suspicion, produced a report for the Committee of Public Safety, alleging Chaumette&#x27;s involvement in an anti-government plot, revealed by Chabot, although Chabot had never named Chaumette himself.

In the early spring of 1794, Chaumette increasingly became target of allegations that he was a counterrevolutionary. Hébert and his associates planned an armed uprising to overthrow Robespierre, but Chaumette, along with fellow sans-culotte leader François Hanriot, refused to take part. When the Hébertists were arrested on 4 March, Chaumette was originally spared, but on 13 March he too was arrested. The other Hébertists were executed with their leader Jacques Hébert on 24 March 1794, but Chaumette was held in prison until found guilty of taking part in the prison plot at Luxembourg Palace. He was sentenced to death on the morning of 13 April and guillotined that same afternoon. Also executed was his unlikely group of co-conspirators including Lucile Desmoulins, wife of the recently executed Camille Desmoulins, Françoise Hebert, wife of the recently executed Hébert, Gobel, former Bishop of Paris, Arthur Dillon and an assortment of other prisoners of various types.

Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette&#x27;s legacy mainly consists of his ultra-radical philosophies that were regarded as excessive even by his colleagues.

==Religious philosophy==
In 1790 Chaumette reviewed the work of Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, a French Catholic philosopher wishing for a theocratic society in which the most devout people would guide the rest of the population. The review provides a substantiated outline of Chaumette&#x27;s philosophies. He criticizes Saint-Martin&#x27;s ideal due to its similarity to France&#x27;s feudal order before the Revolution in which the rule of the monarch was legitimized by the divine right of kings. The review soon develops into a much broader attack on religion. Chaumette calls all Christians &quot;enemies of reason&quot;, and their ideas &quot;ridiculous.&quot; He wonders &quot;over whom to get more embarrassed; him who believes he can deceive humans in the eighteenth century with such farces or him who has the weakness to let himself be deceived.&quot;

The review also criticizes the very notion of free will as a construct that authorizes Christianity to proscribe &quot;unmoral&quot; actions. Chaumette emphasizes a greater reliance on our instincts and a greater embracing of the apparent world, instead of Christianity&#x27;s concern with the afterlife. In his philosophy, he is rather critical of human beings stating that &quot;everyone knows that humans are nothing more than what education makes of them; [...and thus] if one wants them just, one must furnish them with notions of fairness, not ideas from seventh heaven [...] because the sources of all of human&#x27;s grief are ignorance and superstition.&quot;

<text>ABB Group is a Swedish-Swiss multinational electrical engineering corporation. Incorporated in Switzerland as ABB Ltd., and headquartered in Zurich, it is dual-listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich and the Nasdaq Nordic exchange in Stockholm, Sweden. ABB was ranked 340th in the Fortune Global 500 list of 2020 and has been a global Fortune 500 company for 24 years.

ABB was formed in 1988 when Sweden&#x27;s Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) and Switzerland&#x27;s Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie merged to create Asea Brown Boveri, later simplified to the initials ABB. Both companies were established in the late 1800s and grew into major electrical equipment manufacturers, a business in which ABB remains active. Its traditional core activities include power generation, transmission and distribution; industrial automation, and robotics. Between 1989 and 1999, the company was also active in the rolling stock manufacturing sector. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, ABB acquired hundreds of other companies, often in central and eastern Europe, as well as in Asia and North America.

On occasion, the company&#x27;s operations have encountered controversy. During 2001, an ABB entity pled guilty for bid rigging; the firm has also had three US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bribing resolutions against it; in 2004, 2010, and 2022. In early 2002, ABB announced its first-ever annual loss, which was attributed to asbestos-related litigation. Within three years, the company had successfully restructured its operations. During the 2010s, ABB largely focused its growth strategy on the robotics and industrial automation sectors. Before the sale of its Power Grids division to Hitachi in 2020, ABB was Switzerland&#x27;s largest industrial employer.

== History ==
=== Predecessor companies and formation ===
Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA, English translation: General Swedish Electrical Limited Company) was founded in 1883 in Västerås, Sweden by Ludvig Fredholm as manufacturer of electrical light and generators.

Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Zurich, Switzerland by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri as a Swiss group of electrical engineering companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.

On 10 August 1987, ASEA and BBC announced they would merge to form ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB). The new corporation would remain headquartered in both Zurich, Switzerland and Västerås, Sweden, with each parent company holding 50 percent. The merger created a global industrial group with revenue of approximately $15 billion and 160,000 employees.

When ABB began operations on 5 January 1988, its core operations included power generation, transmission and distribution; electric transportation; and industrial automation and robotics.

In its first year, ABB undertook some 15 acquisitions, including the environmental control group Fläkt AB of Sweden, the contracting group Sadelmi/Cogepi of Italy, and the railway manufacturer Scandia-Randers A/S of Denmark. During 1989, ABB purchased an additional 40 companies, including Westinghouse Electric&#x27;s transmission and distribution assets, and announced an agreement to purchase the Stamford, Connecticut-based Combustion Engineering (C-E).

===1990s===
During 1990, ABB bought the robotics business of Cincinnati Milacron in the US. The acquisition expanded ABB&#x27;s presence in automated spot-welding and positioned the company to better serve the American automotive industry. ABB&#x27;s 1991 introduction of the IRB 6000 robot, demonstrated its increased capacity in this field. The first modular robot, the IRB 6000, can be reconfigured to perform a variety of specific tasks. At the time of its launch, the IRB 6000 was the fastest and most accurate spot-welding robot on the market.

In the early 1990s, ABB started expanding in Central and Eastern Europe. By the end of 1991, the company employed 10,000 people in the region. The following year, that number doubled. A similar pattern played out in Asia, where economic reforms in China and the lifting of some economic sanctions, helped open the region to a new wave of outside investment and industrial growth. By 1994, ABB had 30,000 employees and 100 plants, engineering, service and marketing centers across Asia; numbers that would continue to grow. Through the 1990s, ABB continued its strategy of targeted expansion in Eastern Europe, the Asia–Pacific region and the Americas.

In 1990, ABB also expanded into Australia when it acquired Commonwealth Engineering&#x27;s (Comeng) plant in Dandenong, Melbourne. ABB continued to manufacture Comeng&#x27;s B-class Melbourne tram at the plant. However, it did not continue manufacturing Comeng&#x27;s Adelaide 3000 class railcar, which was manufactured by Clyde Engineering instead.

During 1995, ABB agreed to merge its rail engineering unit with that of Daimler-Benz of Germany; the goal of this arrangement was to create the world&#x27;s largest maker of locomotives and railway cars. The new company, ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation (Adtranz), had an initial global market share of nearly 12 percent. The merge took effect on 1 January 1996.

A few months following the start of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, ABB announced plans to accelerate its expansion in Asia as well as to improve the productivity and profitability of its Western operations. The firm took an $850 million restructuring charge and shed 10,000 jobs as the firm shifted more resources towards emerging markets and scaled back some of its facilities in higher-cost countries.

In June 1998, ABB announced that it would acquire Sweden-based Alfa Laval&#x27;s automation unit, which at the time was one of Europe&#x27;s top suppliers of process control systems and automation equipment.

During 1999, as a final step in the integration of the companies formerly known as ASEA and BBC, the directors unanimously approved a plan to create a unified, single class of shares in the group.

That same year, ABB completed its purchase of Elsag Bailey Process Automation, a Netherlands-based maker of industrial control systems, in exchange for $2.1 billion. The acquisition increased ABB&#x27;s presence in the high-tech industrial robotics and factory control system sectors, which reducing its reliance on traditional heavy engineering sectors such as power generation and transmission.

In 1999, the company sold its stake in the Adtranz train-building business to DaimlerChrysler. Instead of building complete locomotives, ABB&#x27;s transportation activities shifted increasingly toward traction motors and electric components. That same year, ABB and France-based Alstom, announced the merger of their power generation businesses in a 50-50 joint company, ABB Alstom Power. Separately, in December 1999, ABB agreed to sell its nuclear power business to British Nuclear Fuels of the United Kingdom.

===2000s===

During 2000, ABB divested its interests in ABB Alstom Power and sold its boiler and fossil-fuel operations (including Gas turbines) to Alstom. Thereafter, ABB&#x27;s power business was focused on renewable energy and transmission and distribution.

In early 2002, ABB announced its first-ever annual loss, a $691 million net loss for 2001. The loss was caused by ABB&#x27;s decision to nearly double its provisions for settlement costs in asbestos-related litigation against its American subsidiary Combustion Engineering from $470 million to $940 million; these claims were linked to asbestos products sold by Combustion Engineering prior to its acquisition by ABB. At the same time, ABB&#x27;s board announced it would seek the return of money &quot;paid in excess of obligations to Goran Lindahl and to Percy Barnevik,&quot; two former chief executive officers of the group. Barnevik received some $89 million in pension benefits when he left ABB in 2001; Lindahl, who succeeded Barnevik as CEO, had received $50 million in pension benefits.

In 2004, ABB sold its upstream oil and gas business, ABB Vetco Gray, to a consortium of private equity investors for an initial sum of $925 million; despite the sale, ABB continued to play an active role in the oil and gas industry via its core automation and power technology businesses.

During 2005, ABB delisted its shares from the London Stock Exchange and Frankfurt Stock Exchange. During the following year, the company ended its financial uncertainties via the finalization of a $1.43 billion plan to settle asbestos liabilities against its US subsidiaries, Combustion Engineering and ABB Lummus Global, Inc. A three-part capital strengthening plan also aided in ABB&#x27;s recovery.

In August 2007, ABB Lummus Global, ABB&#x27;s downstream oil and gas business, was sold to CB&amp;I in exchange for $950 million. The sale led to ABB making an accelerated $204 million payment to the CE Asbestos PI Trust, a trust fund covering the asbestos liabilities of Combustion Engineering.

During 2008, ABB agreed to acquire Kuhlman Electric Corporation, a US-based maker of transformers for the industrial and electric utility sectors. In November 2008, ABB acquired Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation to expand its presence in Western Canada&#x27;s oil and gas industries.

===2010s===

In September 2010, the company bought K-TEK, a manufacturer of level measurement instruments, for $50 million; it was incorporated into ABB&#x27;s Measurement Products business unit within ABB&#x27;s Process Automation division.

During July 2010, ABB in Cary, North Carolina received a $4.2 million grant from the US federal government to develop energy storing magnets.

On 10 January 2011, ABB invested $10 million in ECOtality, a San Francisco-based developer of charging stations and power storage technologies, to enter North America&#x27;s electric vehicle charging market. On 1 July of that year, the company announced its acquisition of Epyon B.V. of the Netherlands, an early leader in the European EV-charging infrastructure and maintenance markets.

During early 2011, ABB acquired Baldor Electric in exchange for $4.2 billion in an all-cash transaction; this move aligned with ABB&#x27;s strategy to increase its market share in the North American industrial motors business. On 30 January 2012, the company announced the acquisition of Thomas &amp; Betts, a North American specialist in low voltage products for industrial, construction and utility applications, in a $3.9 billion cash transaction. On 15 June 2012, ABB completed its acquisition of commercial and industrial wireless technology specialists Tropos.

In July 2013, ABB acquired Power-One in a $1 billion all-cash transaction, to become the leading global manufacturer of solar inverters. That same year, Fastned selected ABB to supply more than 200 Terra fast-charging stations along highways in the Netherlands.

In 2016, ABB was awarded a contract on the TANAP gas pipeline project in Turkey to deliver the telecommunications, security and control infrastructure to contribute to safe, secure, and reliable operation of the pipeline throughout its lifetime. The TANAP pipeline is the largest diameter and with 1,850 km length, the longest pipeline ever built in Turkey, crossing 20 districts and will bring Azerbaijan&#x27;s natural gas through Georgia, Turkey and Greece into the rest of Europe. The $11 billion TANAP pipeline will interconnect with the South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) at Turkey&#x27;s border with Georgia and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) at its border with Greece.

On 6 July 2017, ABB announced it had completed its acquisition of Bernecker + Rainer Industrie-Elektronik (B&amp;R), the largest independent provider of product and software-based open-architecture for industrial automation.

During January 2018, ABB became the title partner of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship, the world&#x27;s first fully electric international FIA motorsport series. On 30 June 2018, the company completed its acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions, General Electric&#x27;s global electrification business.

On 17 December 2018, ABB announced it had agreed to sell 80.1% of its Power Grids business to Hitachi; the former Power Grids division thus became a part of the Hitachi Group and was rebranded to Hitachi Energy. During December 2022, it was confirmed that Hitachi had acquired the remaining 19.9% of the business.

===2020s===
In March 2020, ABB announced that it had agreed to sell its solar inverter business to Italian solar inverter manufacturer Fimer; the transaction includes all of ABB&#x27;s manufacturing and R&amp;D sites in Finland, Italy and India, along with 800 employees across 26 countries.

During mid-2021, ABB announced its involvement in the construction of the first permanent electric road that powers private vehicles and commercial vehicles such as trucks and buses.

During December 2022, ABB opened a new 67,000 square metre robotics factory in Shanghai following a $150 million investment.

In June 2023, ABB agreed to acquire smart home automation provider Eve Systems.

In September 2023, ABB announced it would partner with the Well Done Foundation to monitor methane and greenhouse gas emissions from orphaned wells in the United States.

In January 2024, ABB acquired Real Tech, a prominent Canadian company specializing in innovative optical sensor technology for real-time water monitoring and testing. It also acquired R&amp;D Engineering Firm Meshmind to Expand AI and Software Capabilities

In May 2024, ABB agreed to acquire the wiring accessories business of Siemens in China. This deal will give access to a distribution network across 230 cities in China.

== Products and services ==
=== Major product launches and innovations ===

In 1990, ABB launched Azipod, a family of electric propulsion systems that extends below the hulls of large ships, providing both thrust and steering functions. Developed in cooperation with the Finnish shipbuilder Masa-Yards, Azipod has demonstrated the viability of hybrid-electric power in seagoing vessels, while also increasing maneuverability, fuel efficiency and space efficiency.

In 1998, ABB launched the FlexPicker, a robot using a three-armed delta design uniquely suited to the picking and packing industry.

In 2000, ABB brought to market the world&#x27;s first commercial high-voltage shore-to-ship electric power, at the Swedish port of Gothenburg. Supplying electricity to berthed ships from the shore enables vessels to shut down their engines while in port, significantly reducing noise, vibrations and carbon emissions.

In 2004, ABB launched its Extended Automation System 800xA, an industrial system for the process industries. Today, the company is the global market leader in distributed control systems.
In May 2013, ABB Sécheron SA joined with several groups in Geneva TOSA (Trolleybus Optimisation Système Alimentation, or in English, Trolleybus Power System Optimization) in a one-year demonstration of a trolleybus route using a novel charging system. Rather than overhead wires, charging is accomplished by fixed overhead devices located at stops along the route and at the terminus. Jean-Luc Favre, head of Rail ISI, discussed the promising role of improved electric transport technology in ABB.

In 2014, ABB unveiled YuMi, a collaborative industrial dual-arm assembly robot that permits people and machines to work side by side, unlocking new potential for automation in a range of industries.

In 2018, ABB unveiled the Terra High Power charger for electric vehicles, capable of delivering enough to charge in eight minutes to enable an electric car to travel 200 kilometers.

=== Electrification ===

ABB&#x27;s Electrification business area offers products and services from substation to socket. Customers include a wide range of industry and utility operations, plus commercial and residential buildings. The business has strong exposure to a range of rapidly growing segments, including renewables, e-mobility, data centers and smart buildings.

Its offerings include electric vehicle chargers, modular substations, distribution automation; products to protect people, installations and electronic equipment from overcurrents such as enclosures, cable systems and low-voltage circuit breakers; measuring and sensing devices, control products, switches and wiring accessories.

The business also offers KNX systems that integrate and automate a building&#x27;s electrical installations, ventilation systems, and security and data communication networks. Electrification incorporates an &quot;Electrification Solutions&quot; unit manufacturing low voltage switchgear and motor control centers.

The acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions, which was completed in June 2018, further strengthened ABB&#x27;s #2 global position in electrification.

=== Motion ===
ABB&#x27;s Motion business area provides a range of electrical motors, generators, drives and services, as well as integrated digital powertrain solutions. Motion is the #1 player in the market globally. In September 2023, it was announced ABB Motion had acquired a minority stake in the Burlington-headquartered wind turbine analytics software company, WindESCo.

=== Robotics and discrete automation ===

ABB&#x27;s Robotics &amp; Discrete Automation business area combines machine and factory automation systems, mainly from B&amp;R, which ABB acquired in 2017, with a comprehensive robotics concepts and applications suite.
ABB has installed over 300,000 robots globally. The Robotics &amp; Discrete Automation business has been positioned to capture the opportunities associated with the &quot;factory of the future&quot; by providing services for flexible manufacturing and smart machinery.

The business is #2 globally, with a #1 position in robotics in the high-growth Chinese market, where ABB is expanding its innovation and production capacity by investing in a new robotics factory in Shanghai.

=== Process automation ===
The Process Automation business area provides a range of services for process and hybrid industries, including its industry-specific integrated automation, electrification and digital services, control technologies, software and advanced services, as well as measurement &amp; analytics, marine and turbocharging offerings.

==Former divisions==
=== Power Grids ===
The Power Grids business area offered components for the transmission and distribution of electricity, and incorporated ABB&#x27;s manufacturing network for transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers, and associated high voltage equipment such as digital protective relays. It also offered maintenance services.

A key part of Power Grids&#x27; offering were turnkey systems and service for power transmission and distribution grids and for power plants; this included electrical substations and substation automation systems, flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, and network management systems. The division was subdivided into the four business units High Voltage Products, Transformers, Grid Automation and Grid Integration.

In 2010, ABB&#x27;s North American headquarters in Cary, North Carolina, announced a new partnership with Sensus of Raleigh, North Carolina, to develop technologies to work together on smart grids.

During 2014, ABB formed a joint venture with Hitachi to provide HVDC system solutions in Japan.

In December 2018, ABB and Hitachi announced that the latter would take over ABB&#x27;s entire Power Grids division in exchange for roughly $6.4 billion. Hitachi officially acquired 80.1% of the business in July 2020. Initially known as &quot;Hitachi ABB Power Grids&quot;, the new Hitachi subsidiary was rebranded as Hitachi Energy in October 2021. The transaction was one of Hitachi&#x27;s biggest-ever deals, as it shifted focus to a higher-growth market for electricity networks. Hitachi acquired the remainder of the company from ABB in 2022.

In July 2021, ABB confirmed the sale of its mechanical power transmission business, Dodge, to American company RBC Bearings Incorporated for $2.9bn.

=== Rolling stock manufacturing ===

ABB Group entered the heavy rail rolling stock manufacturing market in 1989 through a 40% shareholding in a consortium, headed with Trafalgar House and some former British Rail employees, that purchased British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL), the formerly state-owned manufacturing arm of British Rail. BREL was the first division of British Rail to be privatised as part of a phased plan initiated by the third Thatcher ministry. ABB took over two rolling stock manufacturing facilities from BREL; the Derby Litchurch Lane Works and York Carriage Works. Additionally, ABB took over Crewe Works in a purely maintenance capacity. During September 1992, ABB Group purchased the stakes of the other members of the consortium to become the sole owner with the business rebranded ABB Transportation.

The first trains produced at either facility under ABB ownership were for an order for 22 three-carriage Class 320 electric multiple units, built at ABB York for Glasgow&#x27;s suburban railways in 1990. That same year, ABB York finished an order for five similar four-car Class 322 units for the new Stansted Express service. Between 1990 and 1991, ABB York built 24 two-car Class 456 third rail trains for Network SouthEast services out of London Waterloo. A further order for 97 four-car Class 465 units was completed at ABB York for Network SouthEast services in and around Kent between 1991 and 1994. Numerous diesel multiple units were also built at ABB York, including 76 Class 165 suburban units for Chiltern Main Line and Great Western Main Line commuter services between 1990 and 1992, followed by 21 Class 166 three-car express units for longer-distance services out of London Paddington.

After initially focusing its resources on rolling stock refurbishment, the first new trains to roll off the production line at ABB Derby were the ten two-car Class 482 trains, built for the Waterloo &amp; City line while it was still under the control of Network SouthEast (since transferred to the London Underground). In 1995, ABB Derby built 16 four-car Class 325 electric freight multiple units for the Royal Mail to replace their ageing fleet of parcels carriages. During the mid-1990s, in a bid to expand their international portfolio, both the Derby and York plants completed a number of ABB Eurotram light rail vehicles for the Strasbourg tramway in France. Around the same time, in a further diversification, ABB partnered with Brush Traction to construct the fleet of 46 Class 92 electric locomotives for hauling freight trains through the Channel Tunnel; ABB were involved in the design and construction of many components including the traction motors, while final assembly took place at Brush Works in Loughborough.

The last trains to roll off the production line at ABB York were an order for 41 four-carriage Class 365 electric multiple units for Connex South Eastern and West Anglia Great Northern services between 1994 and 1995. Following the privatisation of British Rail, ABB encountered a decline in train orders, largely due to increased competition from competing manufacturers and no longer having a monopoly on rolling stock production in the British market. Thus the business was rationalised; ABB York was closed in 1996 (it would later be reopened as a rail wagon manufacturing centre by the Thrall Car Manufacturing Company) and all manufacturing activity was relocated to ABB Derby, the operation of which was transferred to the Adtranz joint venture between ABB and DaimlerChrysler in 1996.

During 1997, Adtranz unveiled the Class 168 train for Chiltern Railways. The design of the Class 168 would subsequently be further developed into the Turbostar and Electrostar families of trains, which in turn became the most successful rolling stock design on post-privatisation British railways by number of units sold. During 1999, ABB sold its 50% stake in Adtranz to Daimler for $472 million, thus exiting the rolling stock manufacturing sector. Shortly thereafter, Daimler sold the Adtranz unit to Bombardier Transportation.

==Legacy brands==
===Bailey Controls===
Founded in 1916 by Ervin G. Bailey, Bailey Controls developed the world&#x27;s first steam boiler meter before becoming an industry leader in control and instrumentation of automated processes. In 1989 the company merged with the Italian Elsag Group which also produced automation control and instrumentation devices. Elsag Bailey Process Automation would be acquired by ABB in 1999.

===Fischer &amp; Porter===
The Fischer &amp; Porter Company was founded in 1937 being an industry leader in process instrumentation producing an industry-leading range of flow measurement products, along with devices to measure, indicate, and control other process variables including pressure (most famously the Fisher-Porter tube), temperature, level, and more. In 1994 Fischer &amp; Porter was acquired by Elsag Bailey Process Automation, which in turn was acquired by ABB in 1999.

== Management ==
During September 2013, Ulrich Spiesshofer was named ABB&#x27;s CEO, succeeding Joe Hogan.

In August 2019, ABB announced industrial veteran Björn Rosengren would take over as CEO starting March 2020. Rosengren was then serving as CEO of Swedish mining-equipment giant Sandvik. In the meantime, ABB Chairman Peter Voser was appointed interim CEO on 17 April 2019, succeeding Ulrich Spiesshofer, who stepped down after five-and-a-half years. Voser was elected chairman of the board of directors in April 2015 and succeeded Hubertus von Grünberg, who had been chairman since May 2007. Jürgen Dormann was chairman from 2002 to 2007, and Percy Barnevik from 1999 to 2002.

== Ownership ==
The largest single stake in the firm is held by the Swedish investment company Investor AB, controlled by the Wallenberg family, which holds 12.9%. Activist investor Cevian also holds a large stake in the company.

== Controversy and litigation ==
In December 2022, ABB was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in a bribery scheme in South Africa. It was ordered to pay a total of $460 million to U.S. authorities to settle criminal and civil charges. ABB paid more than $37 million in bribes to a high-ranking Eskom official to influence contracts awarded by the state-owned electric utility company for work on the Kusile Power Station project between 2014 and 2017. The official had influence over the awarding of contracts for power projects in the country. In exchange for the bribes, ABB secured a $160 million contract to provide services related to cabling and installation work at Eskom&#x27;s Kusile Power Station, one of the largest coal-fired power plants in the world.

In a parallel case, the DOJ fined ABB $315 million to settle criminal charges. ABB had to pay $75 million in civil penalties to settle the SEC&#x27;s charges. It was fined 4 million Francs by Swiss authorities. ABB also agreed to repay $104 million to Eskom it was paid in connection with Kusile.

In January 2024, the United States House Committee on Homeland Security and the United States House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party announced an investigation into ABB regarding equipment sold to Chinese state-owned crane manufacturer ZPMC.

<doc id="195683" wikidata="Q433717" url="?curid=195683" title="Richard Burbage">
<text>Richard Burbage (6 January 1567 – 13 March 1619) was an English stage actor, widely considered to have been one of the most famous actors of the Globe Theatre and of his time. In addition to being a stage actor, he was also a theatre owner, entrepreneur, and painter. He was the younger brother of Cuthbert Burbage. They were both actors in drama. Burbage was a business associate and friend to William Shakespeare.

He was the son of James Burbage, a joiner who became a theatrical impresario and entrepreneur, founding a theatre. Burbage was a popular actor by his early 20s. He excelled in plays with the theme of tragedies. His early acting career is poorly documented. As many young actors of his time, he may have played the part of women in productions before taking any of the roles he is known for. As James Burbage acted for the Earl of Leicester&#x27;s company, it has been suggested that his son, Richard, likely got his start with the company as well.

Burbage was described as being short and stout but was said to be an impressive figure, with numerous praises written of him in contemporary accounts. His power and scope as an actor is revealed in the sheer size of the roles he played. He was a great box office draw. Of the hundreds of plays and thousands of roles for actors that date from the 1580–1610 era, there are only twenty or so roles that are longer than 800 lines. Edward Alleyn was the first English actor to manage such roles, in Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; and &quot;The Jew of Malta;&quot; but the majority of these star roles, thirteen of the twenty, were acted by Burbage. He was said to be quite rich because he was earning income from being the primary housekeeper of two playhouses, a sharer in the King&#x27;s Men, a lead actor and a painter.

== Life ==

Burbage was baptised at St Stephen in London on 7 July 1568. He was the second son of his parents, followed by three younger sisters; Alice, Joane, and Ellen. His father brought Burbage to the theatre and had the greatest influence on his career. Being the son of a builder and owner of the first successful permanent playhouse gave him a start in the theatre world. It is said that because he worked in the theatre with his father at such a young age, he learned the basics of working with colours and the techniques of painting, which helped him later in life.

After the death of their father in February 1597, Richard and his brother Cuthbert stepped in to rescue the family&#x27;s interests in two London theatres and found themselves tied up in lawsuits. They kept the Blackfriars Theatre, but leased it to lawyer and impresario Henry Evans, who used it for a troupe of child actors. The other, called simply ‘The Theatre’, was dismantled when they could not resolve terms for a new lease with Giles Allen, the landowner. Richard&#x27;s father was influential in many parts of the acting industry at the time, as he owned one of the largest theatres at the time and directly worked with Shakespeare on his plays.

The beams, posts, and other remnants of ‘The Theatre’ were moved to a new location on the south side of the Thames River and reassembled into a new playhouse called the Globe in 1599.

The Burbage brothers kept half the shares in the new theatre and gave the remainder to Shakespeare and other members of the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. Income from the Blackfriars lease helped fund the move to the Globe. In 1608 the brothers ended the Blackfriars lease and moved the company to the new theatre. Burbage was performing there on 29 June 1613, when it caught fire and burned down. During the winter months, when it was not practical to use the open-air Globe, they used the Blackfriars. It was much smaller and seated about 700 people.

The Burbage brothers maintained a close working and personal relationship throughout their lives; they were neighbours on Halliwell Street in Shoreditch, near the Theatre. 

Burbage married Winifred Turner on 2 October 1600 at St Mary&#x27;s Rotherhithe. Burbage fathered at least eight children; after his death, his widow Winifred married another of the King&#x27;s Men, Richard Robinson.

== Career ==

Richard Burbage was probably acting with the Admiral&#x27;s Men in 1590, then joining Lord Strange&#x27;s Men in 1592, and with the Earl of Pembroke&#x27;s Men in 1593, but most famously he was the star of William Shakespeare&#x27;s theatre company, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, which became the King&#x27;s Men on the ascension of James I in 1603. He played the title role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, including &quot;Hamlet&quot; (in which Burbage was one of the likely influences for the main character and plot), &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and &quot;King Lear&quot;. But he was in great demand and also appeared in the plays of many of the great contemporary writers, such as Ben Jonson (the title role in &quot;Volpone&quot;, and Subtle in &quot;The Alchemist&quot;), John Marston (&quot;The Malcontent&quot;), John Webster (&quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;) and Beaumont and Fletcher (&quot;The Maid&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;). Burbage grew up in the life of the theatre as his father owned one of London&#x27;s playhouses, leading some to cite his upbringing around the arts as the reason for his acting skills.

Unlike Alleyn or his fellow King&#x27;s Man Shakespeare, Burbage never retired from the stage; he continued acting until his death, aged 52, in 1619. He was not such an astute businessman as either Alleyn or Shakespeare; at his death he was said to have left his widow &quot;better than £300&quot; in land—a respectable estate but far less than Alleyn&#x27;s substantial wealth, and less than the net worth of Shakespeare at his death (also aged 52) in 1616.

== Influence on acting ==
Burbage was the first actor to play &quot;Hamlet&quot; and continued to act until he died. Aside from Hamlet, he was also known for his role as the Duke from &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. Burbage&#x27;s acting style allowed him to &quot;easily slip into character&quot;. He was known to play characters believably – a difficult feat during his time: Because of theatre being a newer form of formal entertainment in Elizabethan England, actors could not rely on suspension of disbelief to aid their performance.

Despite this, Burbage was known as one of the best actors of his time, presumably from his reportedly convincing performance as Hamlet throughout the years. It is believed that his performances were so influential to acting during the time, that echoes of his performance as Hamlet are still seen in the way the character is performed today.

== Death ==
Burbage remained a crowd favourite, even when younger actors emerged, for 35 years, and was an idol of his age. His last recorded performance was in 1610, but he acted with the King&#x27;s Men until his death in 1619. His death caused such an outpouring of grief that it threatened to overshadow the official mourning for the death of Queen Anne 10 days prior.

He was buried in St Leonard&#x27;s, Shoreditch, a church close to two theatres: &quot;The Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Curtain Theatre&quot;. His gravestone was said to read &quot;Exit Burbage.&quot; Although his gravestone is now lost, a memorial to him and his brothers was erected in a later century. An anonymous poet composed for him &quot;A Funerall Elegye on the Death of the famous Actor Richard Burbage who died on Saturday in Lent 13 March 1619&quot;, an excerpt of which reads:

Of the many elegies that followed his death, perhaps the most poignant is the brief epitaph:

== Portrayals ==
Burbage was played by Lionel Belmore in the film &quot;Master Will Shakespeare&quot; (1936), by Paul Freeman in the miniseries &quot;Will Shakespeare&quot; (1978), Martin Clunes in the film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), by Jalaal Hartley in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Shakespeare Code&quot; (2007), by Steve Speirs in the BBC sitcom &quot;Upstart Crow&quot; (2016), by Mattias Inwood in the TNT drama &quot;Will&quot; (2017) and by Adam Colborne in the third episode of the miniseries &quot;Good Omens&quot; (2019), co-produced by the BBC and Amazon Video.

London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery houses two portraits of Burbage.

== Speculation about Burbage ==

=== Portraiture ===
It has sometimes been argued that the famous Chandos portrait of Shakespeare was painted by Burbage. His skills were in demand. Some believe that the anonymous oil painting used so often nowadays to show what Burbage looked like was a self-portrait. Dulwich College holds a painting of a female head in a roughly similar style that was generally regarded as his work until it was found out in 1987 that it was probably misattributed to him and that it is a work by a North Italian painter. The &quot;Felton&quot; portrait of Shakespeare is also attributed to Burbage, and also a portrait of a woman which is currently preserved at Dulwich College, in Southeast London.

=== Hamlet theory ===
There is a theory that William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; is written about Richard Burbage, not Shakespeare&#x27;s son Hamnet. A discrepancy between the dates of the death of Hamnet, the death of James Burbage, and the initial drafts of &quot;Hamlet&quot; lead some scholars to believe that Burbage is the inspiration of the titular character.

<text>Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, commonly known simply as Boethius (; Latin: &quot;Boetius&quot;; 480–524 AD), was a Roman senator, consul, &quot;magister officiorum&quot;, polymath, historian, and philosopher of the Early Middle Ages. He was a central figure in the translation of the Greek classics into Latin, a precursor to the Scholastic movement, and, along with Cassiodorus, one of the two leading Christian scholars of the 6th century. The local cult of Boethius in the Diocese of Pavia was sanctioned by the Sacred Congregation of Rites in 1883, confirming the diocese&#x27;s custom of honouring him on the 23 October. 

Boethius was born in Rome a few years after the forced abdication of the last Western Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus. A member of the Anicii family, he was orphaned following the family&#x27;s sudden decline and was raised by Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, a later consul. After mastering both Latin and Greek in his youth, Boethius rose to prominence as a statesman during the Ostrogothic Kingdom, becoming a senator by age 25, a consul by age 33, and later chosen as a personal advisor to Theodoric the Great.

In seeking to reconcile the teachings of Plato and Aristotle with Christian theology, Boethius sought to translate the entirety of the Greek classics for Western scholars. He published numerous transcriptions and commentaries of the works of Nicomachus, Porphyry, and Cicero, among others, and wrote extensively on matters concerning music, mathematics, and theology. Though his translations were unfinished following an untimely death, it is largely due to them that the works of Aristotle survived into the Renaissance.

Despite his successes as a senior official, Boethius became deeply unpopular among other members of the Ostrogothic court for denouncing the extensive corruption prevalent among other members of government. After publicly defending fellow consul Caecina Albinus from charges of conspiracy, he was imprisoned by Theodoric around the year 523. While jailed Boethius wrote &quot;On the Consolation of Philosophy&quot;, a philosophical treatise on fortune, death, and other issues which became one of the most influential and widely reproduced works of the Early Middle Ages. He was tortured and executed in 524, becoming a martyr in the Christian faith by tradition.

== Early life ==

Boethius was born in Rome to a patrician family , but the exact date of his birth is unknown. His birth family, the Anicii, was a notably wealthy and influential &quot;gens&quot; that included emperors Petronius Maximus and Olybrius, in addition to many consuls. However, in the years prior to Boethius&#x27; birth, the family had lost much of its influence. The grandfather of Boethius, a senator by the same name, was appointed as praetorian prefect of Italy but died in 454 during the palace plot against Flavius Aetius. Boethius&#x27; father, Manlius Boethius, who was appointed consul in 487, died while Boethius was still young. Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, another patrician, adopted and raised him instead, introducing to him philosophy and literature. As a sign of their good relationship, Boethius would later marry his foster-father&#x27;s daughter, Rusticiana, with whom he would have two children also named Symmachus and Boethius.

Having been adopted into the wealthy Symmachi family, Boethius had access to tutors that would have educated him during his youth. Though Symmachus had some fluency in Greek, Boethius achieved a mastery of the language—an increasingly rare skill in the Western regions of the Empire—and dedicated his early career to translating the entire works of Plato and Aristotle, with some of the translations that he produced being the only surviving transcriptions of Greek texts into the Middle Ages. The unusual fluency of Boethius in the Greek language has led some scholars to believe that he was educated in the East; a traditional view, first proposed by Edward Gibbon, is that Boethius studied in Athens for eighteen years based on the letters of Cassiodorus, though this was likely to have been a misreading by past historians.

Historian Pierre Courcelle has argued that Boethius studied at Alexandria with the Neoplatonist philosopher Ammonius Hermiae. However, Historian John Moorhead observes that the evidence supporting Boethius having studied in Alexandria is &quot;not as strong as it may appear,&quot; adding that he may have been able to acquire his formidable learning without travelling. Whatever the case, Boethius&#x27; fluency in Greek proved useful throughout his life in translating the classic works of Greek thinkers, though his interests spanned across a variety of fields including music, mathematics, astrology, and theology.

== Rise to power ==

Taking inspiration from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, Boethius left his scholarly pursuits to enter the service of Theodoric the Great. The two had first met in the year 500 when Theodoric traveled to Rome to stay for six months. Though no record survives detailing the early relationship between Theodoric and Boethius, it is clear that the Ostrogothic king viewed him favorably. In the next few years, Boethius rapidly ascended through the ranks of government, becoming a senator by age 25 and a consul by the year 510. His earliest documented acts on behalf of the Ostrogothic ruler were to investigate allegations that the paymaster of Theodoric&#x27;s bodyguards had debased the coins of their pay, to produce a waterclock for Theodoric to gift to king Gundobad of the Burgundians, and to recruit a lyre-player to perform for Clovis, King of the Franks.

Boethius writes in the &quot;Consolation&quot; that, despite his own successes, he believed that his greatest achievement came when both his sons were selected by Theodoric to be consuls in 522, with each representing the whole of the Roman Empire. The appointment of his sons was an exceptional honor, not only since it made conspicuous Theodoric&#x27;s favor for Boethius, but also because the Byzantine emperor Justin I had forfeited his own nomination as a sign of goodwill, thus also endorsing Boethius&#x27; sons. In the same year as the appointment of his sons, Boethius was elevated to the position of &quot;magister officiorum&quot;, becoming the head of all government and palace affairs. Recalling the event, he wrote that he was sitting &quot;between the two consuls as if it were a military triumph, [letting my] largesse fulfill the wildest expectations of the people packed in their seats around [me].&quot;

Boethius&#x27; struggles came within a year of his appointment as &quot;magister officiorum&quot;: in seeking to mend the rampant corruption present in the Roman Court, he writes of having to thwart the conspiracies of Triguilla, the steward of the royal house; of confronting the Gothic minister, Cunigast, who went to &quot;devour the substance of the poor&quot;; and of having to use the authority of the king to stop a shipment of food from Campania which, if carried, would have exacerbated an ongoing famine in the region. These actions made Boethius an increasingly unpopular figure among court officials, though he remained in Theodoric&#x27;s favor.

== Downfall and death ==
In 520, Boethius was working to revitalize the relationship between the Roman See and the Constantinopolitan See—though the two were then still a part of the same Church, disagreements had begun to emerge between them. This may have set in place a course of events that would lead to loss of royal favour. Five hundred years later, this disagreement led to the East–West Schism in 1054, in which communion between the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church was broken.

In 523, Boethius fell from power. After a period of imprisonment in Pavia for what was deemed a treasonable offence, he was executed in 524. The primary sources are in general agreement over the facts of what happened. At a meeting of the Royal Council in Verona, the &quot;referendarius&quot;, Cyprianus, accused the ex-consul Caecina Decius Faustus Albinus of treasonous correspondence with Justin I. Boethius leapt to his defense, crying, &quot;The charge of Cyprianus is false, but if Albinus did that, so also have I and the whole senate with one accord done it; it is false, my Lord King&quot;.
Cyprianus then also accused Boethius of the same crime and produced three men who claimed they had witnessed the crime. Boethius and Basilius were arrested. First the pair were detained in the baptistery of a church, then Boethius was exiled to the &quot;Ager Calventianus&quot;, a distant country estate, where he was put to death. Not long afterwards Theodoric had Boethius&#x27; father-in-law Symmachus put to death, according to Procopius, on the grounds that he and Boethius together were planning a revolution, and confiscated their property. &quot;The basic facts in the case are not in dispute&quot;, writes Jeffrey Richards. &quot;What is disputed about this sequence of events is the interpretation that should be put on them.&quot; Boethius claims his crime was seeking &quot;the safety of the Senate&quot;. He describes the three witnesses against him as dishonorable: Basilius had been dismissed from Royal service for his debts, while Venantius Opilio and Gaudentius had been exiled for fraud. Other sources depict these men in a far more positive light. Cassiodorus describes Cyprianus and Opilio as &quot;utterly scrupulous, just and loyal&quot; and mentions they are brothers and grandsons of the consul Opilio.

Theodoric was feeling threatened by international events. The Acacian schism had been resolved, and the Nicene Christian aristocrats of his kingdom were seeking to renew their ties with Constantinople. The Catholic Hilderic had become king of the Vandals and had put Theodoric&#x27;s sister Amalafrida to death and Arians in the East were being persecuted. Then there was the matter that with his previous ties to Theodahad, Boethius apparently found himself on the wrong side in the succession dispute following the untimely death of Eutharic, Theodoric&#x27;s announced heir.

The method of Boethius&#x27; execution varies in the sources. He may have been beheaded, clubbed to death, or hanged. It is likely that he was tortured with a rope that was constricted around his head, bludgeoned until his eyes bulged out; then his skull was cracked. Following an agonizing death, his remains were entombed in the church of San Pietro in Ciel d&#x27;Oro in Pavia, also the resting place of Augustine of Hippo. His wealth was confiscated and his wife, Rusticiana, reduced to poverty.

Past historians have had a hard time accepting a sincere Christian who was also a serious Hellenist. These worries have largely stemmed from the lack of any mention of Jesus in Boethius&#x27; &quot;Consolation&quot;, nor of any other Christian figure. Arnaldo Momigliano argues that &quot;Boethius turned to paganism. His Christianity collapsed—it collapsed so thoroughly that perhaps he did not even notice its disappearance&quot;. The majority of scholarship has taken a different view, with Arthur Herman writing that Boethius was &quot;unshakably Orthodox Catholic&quot; and Thomas Hodgkin having asserted that uncovered manuscripts &quot;prove beyond a doubt that Boethius was a Christian&quot;. The community that he was a part of valued equally both classical and Christian culture.

==Major works==

=== &quot;De consolatione philosophiae&quot; ===

Boethius&#x27;s best known work is the &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot; (), which he wrote at the very end of his career, awaiting his execution in prison. This work represented an imaginary dialogue between himself and philosophy, with philosophy personified as a woman, arguing that despite the apparent inequality of the world, there is, in Platonic fashion, a higher power and everything else is secondary to that divine Providence.

Several manuscripts survived and these were widely edited, translated and printed throughout the late 15th century and later in Europe. Beyond &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;, his lifelong project was a deliberate attempt to preserve ancient classical knowledge, particularly philosophy. Boethius intended to translate all the works of Aristotle and Plato from the original Greek into Latin.

=== &quot;De topicis differentiis&quot; ===

His completed translations of Aristotle&#x27;s works on logic were the only significant portions of Aristotle available in Latin Christendom from the sixth century until the rediscovery of Aristotle in the 12th century. However, some of his translations (such as his treatment of the topoi in &quot;The Topics&quot;) were mixed with his own commentary, which reflected both Aristotelian and Platonic concepts.

The commentaries themselves have been lost. In addition to his commentary on the Topics, Boethius composed two treatises on Topical argumentation, &quot;In Ciceronis Topica&quot; and &quot;De topicis differentiis&quot;. The first work has six books, and is largely a response to Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Topica&quot;. The first book of &quot;In Ciceronis Topica&quot; begins with a dedication to Patricius. It includes distinctions and assertions important to Boethius&#x27;s overall philosophy, such as his view of the role of philosophy as &quot;establish[ing] our judgment concerning the governing of life&quot;, and definitions of logic from Plato, Aristotle and Cicero. He breaks logic into three parts: that which defines, that which divides, and that which deduces.

He asserts that there are three types of arguments: those of necessity, of ready believability, and sophistry. He follows Aristotle in defining one sort of Topic as the maximal proposition, a proposition which is somehow shown to be universal or readily believable. The other sort of Topic, the differentiae, are &quot;Topics that contain and include the maximal propositions&quot;; means of categorizing the Topics which Boethius credits to Cicero.

BookII covers two kinds of topics: those from related things and those from extrinsic topics. BookIII discusses the relationship among things studied through Topics, Topics themselves, and the nature of definition. BookIV analyzes partition, designation and relationships between things (such as pairing, numbering, genus and species, etc.). After a review of his terms, Boethius spends BookV discussing Stoic logic and Aristotelian causation. BookVI relates the nature of the Topic to causes.

&quot;In Topicis Differentiis&quot; has four books; BookI discusses the nature of rhetorical and dialectical Topics together, Boethius&#x27;s overall purpose being &quot;to show what the Topics are, what their differentiae are, and which are suited for what syllogisms.&quot; He distinguishes between argument (that which constitutes belief) and argumentation (that which demonstrates belief). Propositions are divided into three parts: those that are universal, those that are particular, and those that are somewhere in between. These distinctions, and others, are applicable to both types of Topical argument, rhetorical and dialectical. BooksII and III are primarily focused on Topics of dialectic (syllogisms), while BookIV concentrates on the unit of the rhetorical Topic, the enthymeme. Topical argumentation is at the core of Boethius&#x27;s conception of dialectic, which &quot;have categorical rather than conditional conclusions, and he conceives of the discovery of an argument as the discovery of a middle term capable of linking the two terms of the desired conclusion.&quot;

Not only are these texts of paramount importance to the study of Boethius, they are also crucial to the history of topical lore. It is largely due to Boethius that the Topics of Aristotle and Cicero were revived, and the Boethian tradition of topical argumentation spans its influence throughout the Middle Ages and into the early Renaissance: &quot;In the works of Ockham, Buridan, Albert of Saxony, and the Pseudo-Scotus, for instance, many of the rules of consequence bear a strong resemblance to or are simply identical with certain Boethian Topics ... Boethius&#x27;s influence, direct and indirect, on this tradition is enormous.&quot;

It was also in &quot;De Topicis Differentiis&quot; that Boethius made a unique contribution to the discourse on dialectic and rhetoric. Topical argumentation for Boethius is dependent upon a new category for the topics discussed by Aristotle and Cicero, and &quot;[u]nlike Aristotle, Boethius recognizes two different types of Topics. First, he says, a Topic is a maximal proposition (&quot;maxima propositio&quot;), or principle; but there is a second kind of Topic, which he calls the &quot;differentia&quot; of a maximal proposition. Maximal propositions are &quot;propositions [that are] known per se, and no proof can be found for these.&quot;

This is the basis for the idea that demonstration (or the construction of arguments) is dependent ultimately upon ideas or proofs that are known so well and are so fundamental to human understanding of logic that no other proofs come before it. They must hold true in and of themselves. According to Stump, &quot;the role of maximal propositions in argumentation is to ensure the truth of a conclusion by ensuring the truth of its premises either directly or indirectly.&quot;These propositions would be used in constructing arguments through the &quot;Differentia&quot;, which is the second part of Boethius&#x27; theory. This is &quot;the genus of the intermediate in the argument.&quot; So maximal propositions allow room for an argument to be founded in some sense of logic while &quot;differentia&quot; are critical for the demonstration and construction of arguments.

Boethius&#x27; definition of &quot;differentiae&quot; is that they are &quot;the Topics of arguments ... The Topics which are the Differentiae of [maximal] propositions are more universal than those propositions, just as rationality is more universal than man.&quot; This is the second part of Boethius&#x27; unique contribution to the field of rhetoric. &quot;Differentia&quot; operate under maximal propositions to &quot;be of use in finding maximal propositions as well as intermediate terms,&quot; or the premises that follow maximal propositions.

Though Boethius is drawing from Aristotle&#x27;s Topics, &quot;Differentiae&quot; are not the same as Topics in some ways. Boethius arranges &quot;differentiae&quot; through statements, instead of generalized groups as Aristotle does. Stump articulates the difference. They are &quot;expressed as words or phrases whose expansion into appropriate propositions is neither intended nor readily conceivable&quot;, unlike Aristotle&#x27;s clearly defined four groups of Topics. Aristotle had hundreds of topics organized into those four groups, whereas Boethius has twenty-eight &quot;Topics&quot; that are &quot;highly ordered among themselves.&quot; This distinction is necessary to understand Boethius as separate from past rhetorical theories.

Maximal propositions and &quot;Differentiae&quot; belong not only to rhetoric, but also to dialectic. Boethius defines dialectic through an analysis of &quot;thesis&quot; and hypothetical propositions. He claims that &quot;[t]here are two kinds of questions. One is that called, &#x27;thesis&#x27; by the [Greek] dialecticians. This is the kind of question which asks about and discusses things stripped of relation to other circumstances; it is the sort of question dialecticians most frequently dispute about—for example, &#x27;Is pleasure the greatest good?&#x27; [or] &#x27;Should one marry?&#x27;.&quot; Dialectic has &quot;dialectical topics&quot; as well as &quot;dialectical-rhetorical topics&quot;, all of which are still discussed in &quot;De Topicis Differentiis&quot;. Dialectic, especially in BookI, comprises a major component of Boethius&#x27; discussion on Topics.

Boethius planned to completely translate Plato&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues&quot;, but there is no known surviving translation, if it was actually ever begun.

===&quot;De arithmetica&quot;===

Boethius chose to pass on the great Greco-Roman culture to future generations by writing manuals on music, astronomy, geometry and arithmetic.

Several of Boethius&#x27; writings, which were hugely influential during the Middle Ages, drew on the thinking of Porphyry and Iamblichus. Boethius wrote a commentary on the &quot;Isagoge&quot; by Porphyry, which highlighted the existence of the problem of universals: whether these concepts are subsistent entities which would exist whether anyone thought of them, or whether they only exist as ideas. This topic concerning the ontological nature of universal ideas was one of the most vocal controversies in medieval philosophy.

Besides these advanced philosophical works, Boethius is also reported to have translated important Greek texts on the topics of the quadrivium His loose translation of Nicomachus&#x27;s treatise on arithmetic (&quot;De institutione arithmetica libri duo&quot;) and his textbook on music (&quot;De institutione musica libri quinque&quot;, unfinished) contributed to medieval education. &quot;De arithmetica&quot; begins with modular arithmetic, such as even and odd, evenly even, evenly odd, and oddly even. He then turns to unpredicted complexity by categorizing numbers and parts of numbers. His translations of Euclid on geometry and Ptolemy on astronomy, if they were completed, no longer survive. Boethius made Latin translations of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De interpretatione&quot; and &quot;Categories&quot; with commentaries. In his article &quot;The Ancient Classics in the Mediaeval Libraries&quot;, James Stuart Beddie cites Boethius as the reason Aristotle&#x27;s works were popular in the Middle Ages, as Boethius preserved many of the philosopher&#x27;s works.

=== &quot;De institutione musica&quot; ===
Boethius&#x27; or was one of the first musical texts to be printed in Venice between the years of 1491 and 1492. It was written toward the beginning of the sixth century and helped medieval theorists during the ninth century and onwards understand ancient Greek music. Like his Greek predecessors, Boethius believed that arithmetic and music were intertwined, and helped to mutually reinforce the understanding of each, and together exemplified the fundamental principles of order and harmony in the understanding of the universe as it was known during his time.

In &quot;De Musica&quot;, Boethius introduced the threefold classification of music:
* &quot;Musica mundana&quot; – music of the spheres/world; this &quot;music&quot; was not actually audible and was to be understood rather than heard
* &quot;Musica humana&quot; – harmony of human body and spiritual harmony
* &quot;Musica instrumentalis&quot; – instrumental music

In &quot;De musica&quot; I.2, Boethius describes &#x27;musica instrumentis&#x27; as music produced by something under tension (e.g., strings), by wind (e.g., aulos), by water, or by percussion (e.g., cymbals). Boethius himself does not use the term &#x27;instrumentalis&#x27;, which was used by Adalbold II of Utrecht (9751026) in his &quot;Epistola cum tractatu&quot;. The term is much more common in the 13th century and later. It is also in these later texts that &quot;musica instrumentalis&quot; is firmly associated with audible music in general, including vocal music. Scholars have traditionally assumed that Boethius also made this connection, possibly under the header of wind instruments (&quot;administratur ... aut spiritu ut tibiis&quot;), but Boethius himself never writes about &quot;instrumentalis&quot; as separate from &quot;instrumentis&quot; explicitly in his very brief description.

In one of his works within &quot;De institutione musica&quot;, Boethius said that &quot;music is so naturally united with us that we cannot be free from it even if we so desired.&quot;
During the Middle Ages, Boethius was connected to several texts that were used to teach liberal arts. Although he did not address the subject of trivium, he did write many treatises explaining the principles of rhetoric, grammar, and logic. During the Middle Ages, his works of these disciplines were commonly used when studying the three elementary arts. The historian R. W. Southern called Boethius &quot;the schoolmaster of medieval Europe.&quot;

An 1872 German translation of &quot;De Musica&quot; was the magnum opus of Oscar Paul.

===&quot;Opuscula sacra&quot;===
Boethius also wrote Christian theological treatises, which supported orthodox theology and condemned Arianism and other heterodox forms of Christianity.

Five theological works are known:
* &quot;De Trinitate&quot; – &quot;The Trinity&quot;, where he defends the Council of Chalcedon Trinitarian position, that God is in three persons who have no differences in nature. He argues against the Arian view of the nature of God, which put him at odds with the faith of the Arian King of Italy.
* &quot;Utrum Pater et filius et Spiritus Sanctus de divinitate substantialiter praedicentur&quot; – &quot;Whether Father, Son and Holy Spirit are Substantially Predicated of the Divinity&quot;, a short work where he uses reason and Aristotelian epistemology to argue that the Catholic views of the nature of God are correct.
* &quot;Quomodo substantiae&quot;, Boethius&#x27; claim that all substances are good.
* &quot;De fide catholica&quot; – &quot;On the Catholic Faith&quot;
* &quot;Contra Eutychen et Nestorium&quot; – &quot;Against Eutyches and Nestorius,&quot; from , which dates it as the earliest of his theological works. Eutyches and Nestorius were contemporaries in the early to mid-5th century who held divergent Christological theologies. Boethius argues for a middle ground in conformity with Roman Catholic faith.

His theological works played an important part during the Middle Ages in philosophical thought, including the fields of logic, ontology, and metaphysics.

== Legacy ==

Edward Kennard Rand dubbed Boethius the &quot;last of the Roman philosophers and the first of the scholastic theologians&quot;. Despite the use of his mathematical texts in the early universities, it is his final work, the &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;, that assured his legacy in the Middle Ages and beyond. This work is cast as a dialogue between Boethius himself, at first bitter and despairing over his imprisonment, and the spirit of philosophy, depicted as a woman of wisdom and compassion. &quot;Alternately composed in prose and verse, the &quot;Consolation&quot; teaches acceptance of hardship in a spirit of philosophical detachment from misfortune&quot;.

Parts of the work are reminiscent of the Socratic method of Plato&#x27;s dialogues, as the spirit of philosophy questions Boethius and challenges his emotional reactions to adversity. The work was translated into Old English by King Alfred and later into English by Chaucer and Queen Elizabeth. Many manuscripts survive and it was extensively edited, translated and printed throughout Europe from the 14th century onwards.

&quot;The Boethian Wheel&quot; is a model for Boethius&#x27; belief that history is a wheel, a metaphor that Boethius uses frequently in the &quot;Consolation&quot;; it remained very popular throughout the Middle Ages, and is still often seen today. As the wheel turns, those who have power and wealth will turn to dust; men may rise from poverty and hunger to greatness, while those who are great may fall with the turn of the wheel. It was represented in the Middle Ages in many relics of art depicting the rise and fall of man. Descriptions of &quot;The Boethian Wheel&quot; can be found in the literature of the Middle Ages from the &quot;Romance of the Rose&quot; to Chaucer.

&quot;De topicis differentiis&quot; was the basis for one of the first works of logic in a western European vernacular, a selection of excerpts translated into Old French by John of Antioch in 1282.

==Veneration==

Boethius was regarded as a Christian martyr by those who lived in succeeding centuries after his death. Currently, he is recognized as a saint and martyr for the Christian faith. He is included within the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot;, though to Watkins &quot;his status as martyr is dubious&quot;. His cult is held in Pavia, where Boethius&#x27; status as a saint was confirmed in 1883, and in the Church of Santa Maria in Portico in Rome. His feast day is 23 October, provided by some as a date for his death. In the current &quot;Martyrologium Romanum&quot;, his feast is still restricted to that diocese. Pope Benedict XVI explained the relevance of Boethius to modern-day Christians by linking his teachings to an understanding of Providence.

==In popular culture==
In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the spirit of Boethius is pointed out by Saint Thomas Aquinas and is mentioned further in the poem.

In the novel &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; by John Kennedy Toole, Boethius is the favorite philosopher of the main character, Ignatius J. Reilly. The &quot;Boethian Wheel&quot; is a theme throughout the book, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981.

C. S. Lewis references Boethius in chapter 27 of the &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot;.

Boethius also appears in the 2002 film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; where he is played by Christopher Eccleston.

In 1976, a lunar crater was named in honor of Boethius.

The title of Alain de Botton&#x27;s book, &quot;The Consolations of Philosophy&quot;, is derived from Boethius&#x27; &quot;Consolation&quot;.

A codex of Boethius&#x27; &quot;The Consolation of Philosophy&quot; is the focus of &quot;The Late Scholar&quot;, a Lord Peter Wimsey novel by Jill Paton Walsh.

In the video game &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, the song &quot;Metres of Boethius&quot; plays within the Sea of Bygone Eras, where the sunken civilization of Remuria once worshipped the Grand Symphony.

<doc id="195685" wikidata="Q333240" url="?curid=195685" title="William Beckford (politician)">
<text>Sir William Beckford (December 1709 – 21 June 1770) was a British Whig politician who twice served as Lord Mayor of London in 1762 and 1769. One of the best known political figures in Georgian era London, his vast wealth derived from the sugar plantations and hundreds of slaves he owned in the British colony of Jamaica. In Britain, Beckford was a supporter of the Whig party, including Prime Minister William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. He also publicly supported progressive causes and frequently championed the London public.

== Early life ==
In 1709, William was born in the British colony of Jamaica, the son of Peter Beckford, Speaker of the House of Assembly there, and the grandson of Colonel Peter Beckford, sometime Governor of the colony. He was sent to England by his family in 1723 to be educated. He studied at Westminster School, and made his career in the City of London.

Between 1736 and 1744, William Beckford travelled back and forth between Jamaica and England, serving in the Jamaican militia, and as an elected representative of the island&#x27;s Assembly.

== Involvement in slavery ==
Beckford&#x27;s grandfather, Peter Beckford, was Governor of Jamaica, and reputedly owned 20 Jamaican estates, 1,200 slaves and left £1,500,000 in bank stock when he died in 1710. He left the vast majority of this wealth to his son Peter Beckford (junior). When Peter Beckford (junior) died in 1735, the young William Beckford inherited his vast estate, as the sole surviving legitimate son.

William Beckford was one of 13 children, but inherited the sole interest in 13 sugar plantations in Jamaica and owned approximately 3,000 enslaved Africans because his older brother, another Peter Beckford, died in 1712. He also served in the Jamaican National Assembly before returning to England in 1744.

In 1760, slaves rose up in revolt on his estate at Esher, in Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica, and they joined Tacky&#x27;s War, which embroiled the Colony of Jamaica in a series of rebellions throughout the decade. According to historian Vincent Brown, 400 enslaved people were killed for their part in the rebellion, and their leader was burned alive.

== Domestic life ==
In 1744 Beckford bought an estate at Fonthill Gifford, near Salisbury, Wiltshire. He made substantial improvements to the property but it was largely destroyed by fire in 1755. &quot;I have an odd fifty thousand pounds in a drawer: I will build it up again,&quot; Beckford promptly declared, and rebuilt it as Fonthill Splendens.

On 8 June 1756, aged 47, he married Maria Marsh, daughter of the Hon. George Hamilton. His only child by this marriage was William Thomas Beckford. Beckford also had eight children born out of wedlock who were left legacies in his will.

From 1751 until his death, his London residence was at 22 Soho Square, which became the centre of his political activities.

== Political life ==
He became an alderman in 1752, a Sheriff of London in 1756 and was then elected Lord Mayor of London first in 1762 and again in 1769. He was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for the City of London in 1754. As a rich patron, he used his &#x27;interest&#x27; in favour of William Pitt the Elder, sponsoring and encouraging his political rise, supporting the Whig cause in general and the West Indies sugar industry (from which his fortune came) in particular.

In September 1758 he wrote to Pitt advising him on the advisability of attacking the French colony of Martinique:
:[Martinique] has but one town of strength (...); all the inhabitants (...) have not victuals to support themselves and numerous slaves for one month, without a foreign supply. The Negroes and stock of the island are worth above four million sterling and the conquest easy (...) For God&#x27;s sake attempt the capture without delay.

Although some laughed at his faulty Latin, his wealth, social position and power obliged people to respect him. He hosted sumptuous feasts, one of which cost £10,000. On one occasion six dukes, two marquises, twenty-three earls, four Viscounts, and fourteen barons from the House of Lords joined members of the House of Commons in a procession to honour him, followed by one of these banquets. He also drew some popular support due to his promotion of political liberalism, in opposition to the party of the &#x27;King&#x27;s Friends&#x27;.

In March 1770 following the release of John Wilkes, of whom Beckford had been an ardent supporter, Beckford decorated his house with a large banner, which according to Horace Walpole bore the word &quot;Liberty&quot; written in embroidered white letters. A few weeks later, on 23 May, Beckford publicly admonished George III. Breaking contemporary protocol he asked the King to dissolve Parliament and to remove his civil councillors, referring to &quot;our happy constitution as it was established in the Glorious and Necessary Revolution&quot;. King George was reportedly more enraged by the breach of protocol than by the nature of the request, yet it attracted the support of the Common Councilmen of London who expressed their gratitude by erecting a monument in the Guildhall, London including a life-size statue of Beckford &quot;(pictured)&quot;, surmounting a stone tablet on which the words Beckford had used to admonish the king are engraved in gold.

== Legacy ==
In 1929, the London County Council renamed a school in Broomsleigh Street, West Hampstead as Beckford Primary School. In 2020, as part of the Black Lives Matter movement, the London Borough of Camden announced they would rename the school again. Possible new names included Beryl Gilroy, after the school&#x27;s first black headteacher. However, as of September 2021, the new name is West Hampstead Primary School.

<doc id="195686" wikidata="Q249313" url="?curid=195686" title="Camille Desmoulins">
<text>Lucie-Simplice-Camille-Benoît Desmoulins (; 2 March 17605 April 1794) was a French journalist, politician and a prominent figure of the French Revolution. He is best known for playing an instrumental role in the events that led to the Storming of the Bastille. Desmoulins was also noted for his radical criticism of the Reign of Terror as the editor of the journal &quot;Le Vieux Cordelier&quot;. He was a schoolmate and close friend of Maximilien Robespierre and a close friend and political ally of Georges Danton, who were the leading figures in the French Revolution. 

A lawyer by training, Desmoulins was enthralled by the Revolution from its outbreak. On 12 July 1789, shortly after Louis XVI dismissed his popular finance minister Jacques Necker, Desmoulins delivered an impassioned call to arms to a crowd before the Palais-Royal. His agitation sparked widespread unrest in Paris, which culminated in the Storming of the Bastille two days later. Through his newfound fame, Desmoulins quickly established himself as a prominent radical pamphleteer. He advocated explicitly in favour of republicanism and revolutionary violence, and mounted relentless attacks on not only the Ancien Régime, but also once-sympathetic revolutionary figures such as Jacques Pierre Brissot. His campaigns ultimately contributed to the fall of the Girondist faction and the beginning of the Reign of Terror.

During the Terror, Desmoulins and his close friend and political ally Georges Danton distanced themselves from Maximilien Robespierre&#x27;s radical Montagnards. Through his new journal &quot;Le Vieux Cordelier&quot;, he criticized the excesses of the Revolutionary Government and made pleas for clemency, which enraged Robespierre and eventually led to his downfall. In April 1794, Desmoulins was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal and guillotined alongside Danton and other accused Dantonists.

==Early life==
Desmoulins was born at Guise, in the province of Picardy, northern France. His father, Jean Benoît Nicolas Desmoulins, was a lieutenant-general of the bailliage of Guise. His mother was Marie-Madeleine Godart, from Wiège-Faty. Through the efforts of a friend, his father obtained a scholarship for the fourteen-year-old Camille to enter the Collège Louis-le-Grand in Paris. Desmoulins proved an exceptional student even among such notable contemporaries as Maximilien Robespierre and Louis-Marie Stanislas Fréron. He excelled in the study of Classical Literature and Politics, and gained a particular affinity for Cicero, Tacitus and Livy.

Desmoulins initially pursued a career in law, and succeeded in gaining acceptance as an advocate in the Parlement of Paris in 1785; however, his stammer and lack of connections to the Parisian legal community proved obstacles to success in this arena. Thus stymied, he turned towards writing as an alternative outlet for his talents; his interest in public affairs led him to a career as a political journalist.

In March 1789, Desmoulins senior was nominated as deputy to the Estates-General from the bailliage of Guise; however, due to illness, he failed to take his seat. Camille Desmoulins, himself limited to the role of spectator at the procession of the Estates-General on 5 May 1789, wrote a response to the event: &quot;Ode aux Etats Generaux.&quot; The Comte de Mirabeau, a powerful political figure within the Estates-General who positioned himself as a bridge between the aristocracy and the emerging reformist movement, briefly enlisted Desmoulins to write for his newspaper at this time, strengthening Desmoulins&#x27; reputation as a journalist .

==Outbreak of the Revolution==
Owing to his difficulties in establishing a career as a lawyer, Desmoulins&#x27; position in Paris was a precarious one and he often lived in poverty. However, he was greatly inspired and enthused by the current of political reform that surrounded the summoning of the Estates-General.

In letters to his father at the time, he rhapsodized over the procession of deputies entering the Palace of Versailles, and criticized the events surrounding the closing of the Salle des Menus Plaisirs to the deputies who had declared themselves the National Assembly—events which led to the famous swearing of the Tennis Court Oath.

The sudden resignation of popular finance minister Jacques Necker by King Louis XVI on 11 July 1789 provided the spark that lit the fuse of Desmoulins&#x27; fame. On Sunday 12 July, spurred by the news of this politically unsettling dismissal, Desmoulins leapt onto a table outside the Cafe de Foy (one of many cafés in the garden of the Palais Royal frequented in large part by political dissidents) and delivered an impassioned call to arms. Shedding his customary stammer in the excitement, he urged the crowd to &quot;take up arms and adopt cockades by which we may know each other&quot;, calling Necker&#x27;s dismissal the of the St. Bartholomew of the patriots. The stationing of a large number of troops in Paris, many foreign, had led Desmoulins and other revolutionaries to believe that a massacre of dissidents in the city was indeed imminent. This was an idea that his audience also found plausible and threatening, and they were quick to join Desmoulins and take up arms in riots that rapidly spread throughout Paris.

The &quot;cockades&quot; worn by the crowd were initially green, a color associated with hope, and made at first from the leaves of the trees that lined the Palais Royal. However, the color green was also associated with the Comte d&#x27;Artois, the reactionary and conservative brother of the King, and the cockades, therefore, were quickly replaced by others in the traditional colors of Paris: red and blue. On 14 July, the people of Paris attacked the Hôtel des Invalides to seize arms, with Desmoulins among them arming himself with a bayonet rifle and two pistols, and embarked upon the Storming of the Bastille.

==Journalism==

In June 1789, Desmoulins had written a radical pamphlet entitled &quot;La France Libre&quot;, which Parisian publishers at the time had refused to print. The rioting surrounding the storming of the Bastille, however, and especially Desmoulins&#x27; personal and publicized involvement in it, altered the situation considerably. On 18 July, Desmoulins&#x27;s work was finally issued. The politics of the pamphlet ran considerably in advance of public opinion; in it, Desmoulins called explicitly for a republic, stating, &quot;... popular and democratic government is the only constitution which suits France, and all those who are worthy of the name of men.&quot; &quot;La France Libre&quot; also examined and criticized in detail the role and rights of kings, of the nobility, and of the Roman Catholic clergy.

Desmoulins&#x27; renown as a radical pamphleteer was furthered by the publication, in September 1789, of his &quot;Discours de la lanterne aux Parisiens,&quot; which featured as its epigraph a quotation from the Gospel of John: &quot;Qui male agit odit lucem&quot; (&quot;He who does evil hates the light&quot;) This was understood to allude to the iron bracket of a lamppost at the corner of the Place de Grève and the Rue de la Vannerie, often used by rioters as a makeshift gallows for anti-revolutionaries and those accused of profiteering. A famous Revolutionary song, &quot;Ça ira&quot; (&quot;It shall be&quot;), also immortalizes this lantern, in the lines, &quot;Les aristocrates à la lanterne... Les aristocrates, on les pendra!&quot; (&quot;To the lantern with the aristocrats... The aristocrats, we&#x27;ll hang them!&quot;)

The &quot;Discours de la lanterne&quot;, written from the perspective of the Place de Grève lamppost, was aggressive in its celebration of political violence, and attributed exalted qualities of loyalty and patriotism to the citizens who made up the Parisian mob. This hard-edged fervor found an appreciative audience in Paris, and Desmoulins, as a result of the pamphlet, became known as the &quot;Procureur-général de la lanterne&quot; (&quot;the Lanterne Prosecutor&quot; or &quot;Lanterne Attorney&quot;).

In September 1789, Desmoulins issued the first number of a weekly publication, &quot;Histoire des Révolutions de France et de Brabant&quot;, which would run until the end of July 1791. This publication combined political reportage, revolutionary polemics, satire, and cultural commentary; &quot;The universe and all its follies,&quot; Desmoulins had announced, &quot;shall be included in the jurisdiction of this hypercritical journal.&quot; The &quot;Révolutions de France et de Brabant&quot; proved extremely popular from its first to its last number. Desmoulins became notorious, and was able to leave behind the poverty that had marked his previous life in Paris.

The politics of the &quot;Révolutions de France et de Brabant&quot; were anti-royalist and pro-Revolutionary. The newspaper celebrated the Revolutionary zeal of &quot;patriots&quot; from the battlefields of Brabant to the Cordeliers district in Paris, home to the well-known and powerful revolutionary Club des Cordeliers, which Desmoulins joined in February 1790 and soon became a prominent member, and also criticized the excesses and inequities of, among a wide range of targets, the aristocratic regime. The savagery with which Desmoulins attacked those with whom he disagreed drew lawsuits, criticism, and reciprocal attacks. His previous friendships with powerful figures such as the Comte de Mirabeau and Baron Malouet, suffered. Both men, angered by what they perceived as libellous statements, declared that Desmoulins should be denounced and Malouet &quot;went so far as to ask that Camille be certified insane.&quot; The &quot;Actes des Apôtres&quot;, the equally savage royalist newspaper that served as the &quot;Révolutions&quot;&#x27; opposite number, engaged in a continual war of insults with the &quot;Révolutions,&quot; and particularly with Desmoulins, whom it dubbed, in a satirical poem, &quot;l&#x27;ânon des moulins&quot; (the little jackass of the windmills).

Upon the death of the Comte de Mirabeau in April 1791, Desmoulins (to whom Mirabeau had, at one time, been a great patron and friend) countered the predominantly sentimental and forgiving eulogies that appeared in the Parisian press by publishing a brutal attack in which he declared the late Mirabeau to be the &quot;god of orators, liars, and thieves.&quot; This presaged later about-face attacks against prominent and once-sympathetic Revolutionary figures, such as Jean Pierre Brissot, by Desmoulins.
On 16 July 1791, Desmoulins appeared before the Paris Commune as the head of a group petitioning for the deposition of Louis XVI, who had, in June of that year, briefly fled Paris with his family before being captured and escorted back to the city. The flight of the king had caused civil unrest, and the petition, presented a day before the anniversary of the Fête de la Fédération, contributed to this agitation. On July 17, a large crowd that had gathered at the Champs de Mars in support of the petition was fired upon by military forces under the command of the Marquis de Lafayette, an incident which became known as the Champs de Mars Massacre. Accounts differ as to whether or not Desmoulins was present at the Champs de Mars; in the subsequent upheaval, warrants for the arrest of himself and Georges Danton were issued. Danton fled Paris, and Desmoulins, though he remained in the city, and spoke on several occasions at the Jacobin Club, decreased his journalistic activities for a time.

Early in 1792, following a bitter quarrel with Jean Pierre Brissot over a legal case which Desmoulins had taken up and discussed in several broadsheets, Desmoulins published a pamphlet, &quot;Jean Pierre Brissot démasqué&quot;, which attacked Brissot savagely and personally. In it, Desmoulins claimed that the invented verb &quot;brissoter&quot; had taken on the meaning &quot;to cheat,&quot; and accused Brissot of betraying republicanism. The case constructed against Brissot in this pamphlet was expanded and used to terrible and destructive effect in Desmoulins&#x27; later publication of 1793, &quot;Fragment de l&#x27;histoire secrète de la Révolution&quot; (also known as the &quot;Histoire des Brissotins&quot;), in which the Girondist political faction, of which Brissot was a prominent member, was accused of traitorous and counter-revolutionary activities. This &quot;history,&quot; produced in response to calls by Brissot and his followers for the dissolution of the Paris Commune and of the Jacobins, contributed to the arrest and execution of many Girondist leaders, including Brissot himself, in October 1793. Desmoulins intensely regretted his role in the death of the Girondists; present at their trial, he was heard to lament, &quot;O my God! my God! It is I who kill them!&quot; He was seen to collapse in the courtroom when the public prosecutor pronounced the sentence of death.

In the summer of 1793, General Arthur Dillon, a royalist and close friend of Desmoulins and his wife, was imprisoned. In an openly published &quot;Lettre au General Dillon&quot;, Desmoulins went far beyond the politically delicate act of defending Dillon, and attacked powerful members of the Committee of Public Safety - notably Saint-Just and Billaud-Varenne.

Beginning 5 December 1793, Desmoulins published the journal for which he would be best known and most celebrated: &quot;Le Vieux Cordelier&quot;. Even the title of this short-lived publication spoke of conflict with the current regime, implying that Desmoulins spoke on behalf of the &quot;old&quot; or original members of the Club des Cordeliers, in opposition to the more radical and extreme factions that had now come into power. In the seven issues that comprised the &quot;Vieux Cordelier&quot;, Desmoulins condemned the suspicion, brutality, and fear that had come to characterize the Revolution, comparing the ongoing Revolutionary Terror to the oppressive reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius and calling for the establishment of a &quot;Committee of Clemency&quot; to counter the climate of mercilessness fostered by the Committee of Public Safety. In the fourth number of the journal, Desmoulins addressed Robespierre directly, writing, &quot;My dear Robespierre... my old school friend... Remember the lessons of history and philosophy: love is stronger, more lasting than fear.&quot; The perceived counter-revolutionary tone in these calls for clemency led to Desmoulins&#x27; expulsion from the Club des Cordeliers and denunciation at the Jacobins, as well as, ultimately, to his arrest and execution.

==Political career, &quot;Le Vieux Cordelier&quot;, and downfall==

Desmoulins took an active part in the 10 August 1792 attack on the Tuileries Palace. Despite his belief that the turmoil had concluded, Robespierre disagreed by asserting that it marked merely the beginning. Immediately afterwards, as the Legislative Assembly (France) crumbled and various factions contended for control of the country, he was appointed Secretary-General to Georges Danton, who had assumed the role of Justice Minister. On 8 September 1792 he was elected as a deputy from Paris to the new National Convention. He was affiliated with The Mountain, and voted for the establishment of the Republic and the execution of Louis XVI. His political views were closely aligned with those of Danton and, initially, Robespierre. 

In autumn 1793, as terror became &quot;the order of the day,&quot; Desmoulins began to speak less and less at the Convention. When he did speak, he was one of the few voices calling for clemency; on 16 October 1793 he was one of the rare voices to speak up after the Convention ordered the arrest of all citizens of governments the Republic was at war with, asking for an exception for Dutch who had been prescribed by their government. Desmoulins also assisted in creating the first draft of the Civil Code and pushed for its implementation.

Desmoulins also spoke in support of a measure proposed in August 1793 that would have given spouses an equal right to administer property. In opposition to Conventionnels who argued for the &quot;natural superiority&quot; of the male sex, Desmoulins condemned the puissance maritale, according to which women were legal nonentities under the guardianship of their husbands, calling it &quot;the creation of despotic governments.&quot; Later that month, Desmoulins argued in favor of no-fault divorce, denouncing a draft article enumerating limited grounds for divorce on the ground that divorce should be freely available at the request of either spouse – a measure that would not be revived in France in full until 1985.

The first number of &quot;Vieux Cordelier&quot; appeared on 5 December 1793. Although it was dedicated to Robespierre along with Danton and called them both friends, it marked the start of a rift between Desmoulins and Robespierre. Initially directed, with Robespierre&#x27;s approval, against the excesses of the ultra-radical Hébertist faction, the journal rapidly expanded and intensified its criticisms of the Committee of Public Safety and the Revolutionary Tribunal. Desmoulins appealed to Robespierre to help steer these institutions in a more moderate direction. On 20 December, Robespierre had proposed the formation of a commission &quot;to examine all detentions promptly and to free the innocent,&quot; an idea shot down by Billaud-Varenne, and Desmoulins &quot;seized on this and called for something more dramatic: a committee of clemency&quot; to put an end to the Terror.

In the &quot;Vieux Cordelier&quot;, especially the third and fourth numbers, Desmoulins criticized the Terror, argued in favor of clemency for prisoners, and demanded the return of freedom of the press:Certain people apparently believe that liberty, like children, needs to go through cries and tears to get to maturity; on the contrary, it is the nature of liberty that, to enjoy it, we need only desire it.  A people is free as soon as it wishes to be, it entered upon its full rights on the 14th of July.  Liberty has neither old age nor infancy; she has but one age, that of strength and vigour. [...] No, this liberty which I worship is not an unknown deity. We are fighting in defense of the good things which she puts into the possession of those who invoke her: these good things are the Declaration of Rights, the sweetness of Republican maxims, fraternity, holy equality, and the inviolability of principles. These are the footprints of the goddess, these are the signs by which I distinguish the nations among whom she dwells.

And by what other sign would you wish that I recognize this divine liberty?  This liberty, be it but an empty name? Is it only an actress of the Opera, la Candeille or la Maillard paraded about with a red cap on, or that statue, forty-six feet high, that David proposes?  If by liberty you do not mean, as I do, principles, but only a bit of stone, then never has there been an idolatry more stupid and more costly than ours.

Oh my dear fellow citizens! Shall we so far debase ourselves as to fall at the feet of such divinities? No, this Liberty descended from Heaven is not a nymph of the Opera, not a red cap, a dirty shirt, or rags and tatters. Liberty is happiness, reason, equality; she is justice, she is embodied in the Declaration of Rights, in your sublime Constitution. Would you have me acknowledge her, fall at her feet, spill my blood for her? Open the prisons of those two hundred thousand citizens whom you call “suspects,” for in the Declaration of Rights there was no prison for suspected persons, but only for felons. Suspicion has no prison, it has the public prosecutor; there are no suspected persons but those who are accused of crime by the law. Do not believe that this measure would be fatal to the Republic, it would be the most revolutionary step you have ever taken.  Desmoulins used a variety of arguments to support his proposal, including pragmatic arguments and historical analysis, making especially heavy use of parallels to Ancient Rome: &quot;You wish to exterminate all your enemies by the guillotine! But was there ever greater folly? Can you kill one person on the scaffold without making yourselves ten more enemies amongst his family and his friends? [...] 

I am of a very different opinion from those who claim that it is necessary to leave Terror on the order of the day. I am confident, on the contrary, that liberty will be assured and Europe conquered so soon as you have a Committee of Clemency. This committee will complete the Revolution, for clemency is itself a Revolutionary measure, the most effective of all when it is wisely dealt out. 

Let imbeciles and rascals call me moderate, if they want. I am certainly not ashamed not to be more outraged than M. Brutus; yet this is what Brutus wrote: &quot;You would do better, my dear Cicero, to put more effort into cutting short the civil wars than in losing your temper and pursuing your personal resentments against the vanquished.&quot;&quot;Desmoulins also argued fervently in favor of renewed freedom of the press, stating that &quot;if freedom of the press existed in a country where the most absolute despotism unites all powers in a single hand, it alone would suffice to act as a counterweight.&quot; He criticized the extreme repression of freedom of the press in revolutionary France:What journalist in France would dare point out the errors of our committees, our generals, the Jacobins, the ministers, or the Commune the way the opposition does to those of the British ministry? Am I, a Frenchman, I, Camille Desmoulins, not as free as an English journalist? The very idea makes me indignant. Let no one tell me that we are in a revolution and that freedom of the press must be suspended during a revolution. Isn’t England, isn’t all of Europe, also in a state of revolution? Are the principles of freedom of the press less sacred in Paris than in London? [...] Can it be that when on one side servitude and venality hold the pen, and on the other freedom and virtue, that there is the least danger that the people, the judge of this combat, could pass to the side of slavery? To even fear such a thing is to insult human reason! Can reason fear a duel with stupidity? I repeat: Only counter-revolutionaries, only traitors, only Pitt, could have an interest in prohibiting unlimited freedom of the press in France; freedom and truth can never fear the pen of servitude and lies. In his fourth number, Desmoulins addressed Robespierre directly: &quot;O!  my dear Robespierre! O my old school friend! you whose eloquent words posterity will reread! Remember the lessons of history of philosophy: that love is stronger, more enduring than fear; that admiration and religion were born of generosity; that acts of clemency are the ladder of myth, as was said by Tertullien, by which members of the Committee of Public Safety have risen to the skies; men never climb thither on stairs of blood.&quot;

Desmoulins made strong use of pragmatic arguments, arguing that the excessive use of terror would cause the people to detest the Revolution and lead to a counter-revolutionary backlash. He backed up his arguments with a variety of sources from history and political theory, including Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince,&quot; arguing that generosity and the distribution of favors help a sovereign gain and maintain popularity while the indiscriminate use of violence leads to the sovereign becoming detested and overthrown. 

Although Desmoulins harshly criticized Hébert&#x27;s demands for the increased use of terror, he explicitly opposed Hébert&#x27;s arrest in his fifth number. In his seventh and final number, authored in March 1794, unpublished during his lifetime, he again implicitly sided with Hébert, stating that he preferred the incessant denunciations of the Hébertists over the icy silence and bourgeois politeness of the Jacobins:I would prefer that we denounce wrongly and indiscriminately, I would even say calumniate, like Père Duchesne, but with that vigour that characterises strong spirits and a republican temper, than to see, today, this bourgeois politeness, this puerile and honest civility, these pusillanimous considerations of the monarchy, this circumspection … for the strongest, for men of credibility or position, ministers or generals, representatives of the people or influential members of the Jacobins, while we melt with heavy stiffness into patriotism in disfavor and disgrace. [...]

Better would be the intemperance of the language of democracy, the pessimism of these eternal detractors of the present, whose bile pours out on everything around them, than this cold poison of fear, which freezes thought to the bottom of the soul, and prevents it from springing up at the Tribune or in writings. Better would be the misanthropy of Timon, who can find nothing beautiful in Athens, than this general terror, like mountains of ice, which, from one end of France to the other, covers the sea of opinion and obstructs its ebb and flow.

The currency of Republics are the winds that blow over the waves of the sea, with this caption: &quot;Tollunt sed attollunt.&quot; They agitate but they elevate. 

Otherwise, I no longer see in the Republic anything but the flat calm of despotism and the smooth surface of the stagnant waters of a swamp; I see in it only an equality of fear, the leveling of courage, and the most generous spirits as base as the most vulgar.Desmoulins also reiterated his opposition to the war with Austria and its allies, stating that &quot;war will always be the resource of despotism, which by its very nature has no power but that of arms and can gain nothing except at the point of a sword.&quot; He accused Robespierre of hypocrisy for entirely reversing his views on the war, which he had originally opposed. 

On 7 January 1794, the Jacobin Club sought to expel Desmoulins from its number. Robespierre, initially seeking to protect Desmoulins, suggested as an alternative that the offending issues of the &quot;Vieux Cordelier&quot; be publicly burnt. Desmoulins&#x27; response,&quot;Brûler n&#x27;est pas répondre&quot; (&quot;Burning is not answering&quot;), echoed the cry of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the influential philosopher whose work was central to Robespierre&#x27;s own vision of the Republic. Robespierre responded to this by calling Desmoulins a &quot;spoilt child&quot; and saying that: &quot;Camille, that if you weren&#x27;t Camille, we wouldn&#x27;t have so much indulgence for you. We treat you like a lost child, and you dare to complain. [...] Well, since he wishes it, let him be covered in ignominy.&quot; Despite this, Desmoulins refused to renounce the &quot;Vieux Cordelier&quot;.

Also in the seventh number, Desmoulins expressed his view that it was freedom of the press and the form of government, rather than virtue, that was the essential basis of a republic. In this, he again directly countered the views of Robespierre.

Meanwhile, the participation of Danton&#x27;s personal secretary, Fabre d&#x27;Églantine, in a financial scam with the East India Company became exposed and he was arrested for corruption and forgery. This scandal cast doubt on Danton and his allies, and Robespierre now supported the expulsion of Desmoulins from the Jacobin club. After the condemnation and execution of the Hébertists in March 1794, the energies of the Montagnards (especially of Saint-Just) turned to the elimination of the &quot;indulgent&quot; faction headed by Danton and voiced by Desmoulins. They were accused of corruption, royalist tendencies, and counter-revolutionary conspiracy, charges were brought before the Committee of Public Safety, and arrest warrants including for Desmoulins were finally issued on 31 March.

==Trial and execution==

Danton, Desmoulins, and many other actual or accused Dantonist associates were tried from April 3 through 5th before the Revolutionary Tribunal. The trial was less criminal in nature than political, and as such unfolded in an irregular fashion. When asked his name and age, Desmoulins responded with: &quot;Benoît Camille Desmoulins, age of thirty-three – the age of Jesus, a critical age for patriots.&quot; The accused were prevented from defending themselves by a decree of the National Convention. This fact, together with confusing and often incidental denunciations (for instance, a report that Danton, while engaged in political work in Brussels, had appropriated a carriage filled with several hundred thousand livres of table linen) and threats made by prosecutor Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville (Desmoulins&#x27; cousin) towards members of the jury, helped to ensure a guilty verdict. Additionally, the accused were denied the right to have witnesses appear on their behalf, though they had submitted requests for several—including, in Desmoulins&#x27; case, Robespierre. The verdict was passed in the absence of the accused, who had been removed from the courtroom to prevent unrest among the trial&#x27;s observers. Their execution was scheduled for the same day.

In a letter to his wife from the Luxembourg Prison, Desmoulins wrote, [I]t is marvellous that I have walked for five years along the precipices of the Revolution without falling over them, and that I am still living; and I rest my head calmly upon the pillow of my writings... I have dreamed of a Republic such as all the world would have adored. I could never have believed that men could be so ferocious and so unjust.

As Desmoulins was taken to the scaffold, he was informed of his wife&#x27;s arrest and went mad. It took several men to get him to the tumbril. He struggled and tried to plead with the mob, ripping his shirt in the process. Lucile, together with 27 others political detainees was hastily convicted for conspiracy, sentenced to death, and executed, eight days later. Of the group of fifteen who were guillotined together on 5 April 1794, including Marie Jean Hérault de Séchelles, Philippe Fabre d&#x27;Églantine and Pierre Philippeaux, Desmoulins died third, and Danton last. Desmoulins and his guillotined associates were buried in the Errancis Cemetery, a common place of interment for those executed during the Revolution. In the mid-19th century, their skeletal remains were transferred to the Catacombs of Paris.

==Family==

On 29 December 1790 Desmoulins married Lucile Duplessis, whom he had known for many years. Lucile&#x27;s father long denied permission for the marriage, believing that the life of a journalist could not support any sort of family. Among the witnesses to the marriage were Robespierre, Brissot, and Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve. The wedding took place at the Saint-Sulpice Church in Paris. The Desmoulins&#x27; only child, Horace Camille, was born on 6 July 1792. 

Lucile Desmoulins was arrested mere days after her husband and condemned to the guillotine on charges of conspiring to free her husband from prison and plotting the &quot;ruin of the Republic.&quot; She was executed on 13 April 1794, the same day as the widow of Jacques Hébert. In a last note to her mother she wrote, &quot;A tear falls from my eyes for you. I shall go to sleep in the calm of innocence. Lucile.&quot;

Horace Camille Desmoulins was raised by Adèle and Annette Duplessis (the sister and mother of Lucile, respectively), who successfully petitioned the in February 1795 for the suspension of the sale of his father&#x27;s belongings. He married Zoë Villefranche and they had four children. He was later pensioned by the French government, and died in 1825 in Haiti.

<text>Antoine Quentin Fouquier de Tinville (, 10 June 17467 May 1795), also called Fouquier-Tinville and nicknamed posthumously the Provider of the Guillotine was a French lawyer and accusateur public of the Revolutionary Tribunal during the French Revolution and Reign of Terror.

From March 1793 he served as the &quot;public prosecutor&quot; in Paris, demanding the execution of numerous accused individuals, including famous ones, like Marie-Antoinette, Danton or Robespierre and overseeing the sentencing of over two thousand of them to the guillotine. In April 1794, it was decreed to centralise the investigation of court records and to bring all the political suspects in France to the Revolutionary Tribunal to Paris. Following the events of the 10th Thermidor, he was arrested early August.

He was tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal as one of the major figures responsible for the excesses and injustices that marked the period of the Reign of Terror. During his trial, he defended himself by stating, &quot;It is not I who ought to be facing the tribunal, but the chiefs whose orders I have executed. I had only acted in the spirit of the laws passed by a Convention invested with all powers.&quot; Generally, his defense involved shifting the blame for the executions onto the Committee of Public Safety, especially on Maximilien de Robespierre.

Despite this defense, he was sentenced to death, alongside the judges and some jurors of the Revolutionary Tribunal, among other charges, for abusing his authority and neglecting proper legal procedures during trials. He was guillotined in Paris on 7 May 1795, and became the last individual to be executed by the Revolutionary Tribunal before its abolition.

His precise role in the Reign of Terror is still a subject of debate; modern historians suggest that it is more valuable to view his role as part of a group of officials and various terrorist actors rather than solely as the sole instigator of the Judicial Terror.

==Biography==

=== Origins ===
The Fouquier de Tinville family, now known as Fouquier d&#x27;Hérouel, descends from an old bourgeois family from the vicinity of Saint-Quentin, in the present-day department of Aisne. In the 18th century, Éloy Fouquier de Tinville, lord of Tinville, Hérouel, Auroir, and Foreste, was a farmer and a royal officer in Péronne.

=== Early career ===

Antoine Fouquier de Tinville was born in Hérouel on 10 June 1746, and was baptized two days later (which often leads to confusion regarding his birthdate). He was the second of five siblings. His father, Éloy Fouquier de Tinville, a farmer and lord of Hérouel, gave him the name of the land of Tinville, while the name Hérouel went to his older brother, Pierre-Éloy. The two younger brothers received the names Foreste and Vauvillé. His mother, Marie-Louise Martine, came from a prosperous family. For six years he studied law in Noyon and in 1774 purchased a position as prosecutor or &quot;procureur&quot; attached to the Châtelet in Paris, which was an exceptional royal jurisdiction tasked with targeting, among other things, revolutionaries. He sold his office in 1781 to pay off his debts and became a clerk under the lieutenant-general of police. In 1775 Fouquier-Tinville married Geneviève-Dorothée Saugnier, his cousin, with whom he would have five children (two twins). He was widowed seven years later. Four months after his wife&#x27;s death, he remarried Henriette Jeanne Gérard d&#x27;Arcourt, with whom he would spend the rest of his life. They had three children together.

In early 1791 &quot;freedom of defence&quot; became the standard; any citizen was allowed to defend another. From the beginning, the authorities were concerned about this experiment&#x27;s future. Derasse suggests it was a &quot;collective suicide&quot; by the lawyers in the Assembly. In criminal cases, the expansion of the right gave priority to the spoken word.

Little is known of the part he played at the outbreak of the Revolution. According to himself, he was part of the National Guard at its formation. He was active in the political committee of his section in 1789. In September 1791 former &quot;advocates&quot; lost their title, their distinctive form of dress, their status, and their profession orders and adapted their practices to the new political and legal situation. Also Fouquier called himself &quot;homme de loi&quot;. In Summer 1792, he supported the sans-culottes movement. On 25 August, backed by his cousin Camille Desmoulins, and after Robespierre refused the position, Fouquier de Tinville became for three months the foreman of a jury established to pass verdicts on the crimes of enemies of the people arrested after the &quot;Insurrection of 10 August 1792&quot;.

After Robespierre refused, Fouquier-Tinville was appointed as president. The Paris commune made the decision to permanently install the guillotine.

===Public accuser===
When the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris was created by the National Convention on 10 March 1793, and Fauré refused, Fouquier was appointed on 15 March as public accuser, an office that he filled from the end of the month until 1 August 1794. According to all the testimonies, including those of his critics, Fouquier-Tinville is said to have been a very hardworking and conscientious man. The documents were sent by the Committee of General Security to the public accuser, who examined them, summarized the facts, grouped the grievances, quoted the incriminating words or writings, and mentioned the denials of the accused. In a word, he drew up his indictment. Fouquier was known for his radicalism. His zeal in prosecution earned him the nickname &quot;Purveyor to the Guillotine.&quot; On 29 July he accused Jacques-Bernard-Marie Montané, president of the tribunal, of being insufficiently radical. On 17 September the Law of Suspects was introduced. On 26 September 1793 Martial Herman was appointed as president and René-François Dumas as vice president; Coffinhal and Joachim Vilate were each appointed as one of the judges and jurors, Adrien Nicolas Gobeau as substitute of the public accuser

Fouquier lived at Rue Saint-Honoré but moved to Place Dauphine and then to :fr:Quai de l&#x27;Horloge both on Île de la Cité. An apartment between the towers of the Conciergerie was the home of Fouquier-Tinville. He lived there with his wife and twins while conducting the trials in the courtroom. His activity in the Conciergerie and the Palace of Justice earned him the reputation of one of the most sinister figures of the Revolution. His office as public accuser arguably reflected a need to display the appearance of legality during what was essentially political command, more than a need to establish actual guilt.

On 29 October 1793, Fouquier-Tinville sent a letter to the National Convention, which was later used during his trial. In the letter, he wrote: We are arrested by the formalities prescribed by the law. [...] Moreover, one wonders, why witnesses? The Convention, all of France, accuse those whose trial is being conducted; the evidence of their crimes is evident; everyone in their hearts is convinced that they are guilty; the tribunal can do nothing on its own, it is obliged to follow the law; it is up to the Convention to remove all the formalities that hinder its progress.Early April 1794 Fouquier-Tinville asked the tribunal to order the Indulgents who &quot;confused the hearing&quot; and insulted &quot;National Justice&quot; to the guillotine. Claiming the Dantonists were not serving the people and were &quot;false patriots&quot;, who had preferred personal and foreign interests to the welfare of the nation. He did not align with any specific political movement, keeping his distance from factions such as the Jacobins, and he did not maintain any particular relationships with leaders from the Montagnards, such as Maximilien Robespierre, as reported by Antoine Boulant.

On 21 May 1794 the government decided that the Terror would be centralised, with almost all the tribunals in the provinces closed and all the trials held in Paris.

==Grande Terreur==
On 10 June, Georges Couthon introduced the Law of 22 Prairial. Legal defense was sacrificed by banning any assistance for defendants brought before the revolutionary tribunal. &quot;If this law passes,&quot; cried a deputy, &quot;all we have to do is to blow our brains out.&quot; Fouquier, who feared to be incapable to deal with the number of trials, sent him a letter, but Robespierre did not reply. The tribunal became a simple court of condemnation that refused suspects the right of counsel and allowed only one of two verdicts – complete acquittal or death - based not on evidence, but on the jurors&#x27; moral conviction. The courtroom was renovated to allow more people to be sentenced simultaneously. It proposed to erect a guillotine inside the courtroom, but it was moved to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine in order to stand out less. According to François Furet, the prisons were overpopulated; they housed over 8,000 &quot;suspects&quot; at the beginning of Thermidor year II. The number of death sentences doubled. Within three days, 156 people were sent in batches to the guillotine; all the members of the Parlement of Toulouse were executed. More than 2,400 people were convicted by the &quot;tribunal révolutionaire&quot; accused of conspiring against liberty. The commune had to solve serious problems in the cemeteries because of the smell. Two new mass graves were dug in mid-July at Picpus Cemetery in the impermeable ground.

One of the last groups he prosecuted included seven nuns, aged 32–66, of the former convent of Carmelites, living in Paris, plus an eighth nun, of the Convent of the Visitation,
. . .who were charged with consorting together and scheming to trouble the State by provoking civil war with their fanaticism...Instead of living at peace within the bosom of the Republic, which had provided for their subsistence, and instead of obeying the laws, adopted the idea of residing together in this same house...and of making this house a refuge for refractory priests and counter-revolutionary fanatics, with whom they plotted against the Revolution and against the eternal principles of liberty and equality which are its basis.

Apparently, the nuns, whom he called criminal assassins, were corrupted by the ex-Jesuit Rousseau de Roseicquet, who led them in a conspiracy to poison minds and subvert the Republic. When the judge read this piece of Fouquier-Tinville&#x27;s prose, he condemned them to be deported, as well as all those who had given them refuge.

===Downfall===

On 26/27 June, Robespierre demanded that Fouquier-Tinville, involved in the trial of Catherine Théot, be replaced as too bound to the Committee of General Security. Fouquier-Tinville&#x27;s career ended with the fall of Robespierre 9 Thermidor. When Robespierre and his supporters gathered that evening at the Hôtel de Ville, Fouquier-Tinville declined an invitation by answering he recognized the Convention alone. The next day, halfway through the proceedings, Fouquier-Tinville, who did not want to pass judgment on his friend the mayor Fleuriot-Lescot, took off his official robe and walked out.

On the 9th Thermidor, the day of the fall of Maximilien de Robespierre, Fouquier-Tinville continued his work without any hindrance. When the Robespierre-affiliated judge, Dumas, was arrested midday during a tumultuous session by a decree of the National Convention, Fouquier-Tinville decided to proceed with judicial proceedings and requested that &quot;justice take its course.&quot; That evening, while dining at Coffinhal&#x27;s, he learned of the arrest of Robespierre, Couthon, Saint-Just, and other Robespierre supporters. He received news of Maximilien de Robespierre&#x27;s escape to the town hall while he was with Gabriel-Toussaint Scellier, a judge from the Revolutionary Tribunal. The next morning, he went to the National Convention to assure them of the Revolutionary Tribunal&#x27;s loyalty. Verifying the identity of the prisoners Fouquier-Tinville had to solve a problem as 13 of them were members of the insurrectionary Commune. Around 2 a.m. Robespierre and 21 &quot;Robespierrists&quot; were accused of counter-revolution and condemned to death by the rules of the law of 22 Prairial.

Although he was briefly kept as the new government&#x27;s prosecutor, as confirmed on 28 July 1794 by Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac and the convention, Fouquier-Tinville was arrested after Louis-Marie Stanislas Fréron denounced him as an accomplice of Robespierre. Informed of his impending arrest, Fouquier-Tinville voluntarily surrendered himself.

Imprisoned on 1 August, Fouquier-Tinville was brought to trial in front of the convention. His defense was that he had only obeyed the decrees of the Committee of Public Safety and the convention. He was granted the right to defend himself before the National Convention, where he appeared on the 21st Thermidor, Year II (8 August 1794). His defense, in which he placed the blame for the executions solely on Robespierre, failed to convince the convention. They decided to proceed with his arrest and trial, along with certain judges and jurors from the Revolutionary Tribunal. 
It is not I who ought to be facing the tribunal, but the chiefs whose orders I have executed. I had only acted in the spirit of the laws passed by a Convention invested with all powers. Through the absence of its members [on trial], I find myself the head of a [political] conspiracy I have never been aware of. Here I am facing slander, [facing] a people always eager to find others responsible.

=== Trial ===

Tallien, one of the leaders of the Thermidorians and a central deputy in the fall of Robespierre, opposed subjecting him to thorough questioning. This is generally interpreted as a maneuver aimed at preventing Fouquier-Tinville from providing lists of deputies who may have been complicit in his judicial work, including Tallien himself. Fouquier defended his innocence vehemently. In a letter to his wife and children dated 12 November 1794, in which he enclosed a lock of hair, he maintained his innocence, claimed to be the victim of slander, and stated that he was &quot;sacrificed to public opinion.&quot;

His trial ensued, lasting forty-one days, the longest of the French Revolution. From the 9th Germinal, Year III (29 March 1795), to the 12th Floréal (1 May), a total of 419 witnesses were called, including 223 for the defense and 196 for the prosecution. Among the witnesses for the prosecution was, for instance, the Paris clerk, who accused him of shedding the blood of innocents, especially Danton. Also among the prosecution witnesses was the bailiff Lucien Dupré, who spoke of his &quot;relentlessness.&quot; Among the witnesses for the defense was the owner of the Palais de Justice tavern, who claimed that Fouquier-Tinville had complained to her about the number of executions, and the lawyer Bernard Malarme, who asserted that he had released many patriots.

Generally, he defended himself by assigning responsibility for the executions of the Revolutionary Tribunal to the Committee of Public Safety, especially Maximilien de Robespierre. According to his testimony, he claimed to have met with Robespierre privately every evening to decide on the executions for the following day. This did not convince his prosecutors and he was sentenced to death.

=== Death ===
He was guillotined on 7 May 1795, together with 15 former functionaries of the Revolutionary Tribunal, who were sentenced as his accomplices. These are his final words, which he wrote before his execution:I have nothing to reproach myself with; I have always complied with the laws, I have never been a creature of Robespierre or Saint-Just; on the contrary, I have been on the verge of being arrested four times. I die for my country and without reproach. I am satisfied: later, my innocence will be recognized.

== Analysis ==
Long considered the primary instigator of the judicial Terror, his role is now nuanced, with the most recent research including him in a broader process of judicial Terror with other actors. Fouquier-Tinville appears to have generally followed the instructions of Maximilien Robespierre but especially those of the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security during the period of the Terror. However, in some cases, he is said to have shown a desire for independence from political power, especially by granting significant rights to certain defendants.

<text>Maurice Tourneux (12 July 184913 January 1917) was a French man of letters and bibliographer.

==Life==
The son of the artist and author J.F.E. Tourneux, he was born in Paris.

He began his career as a bibliographer by collaborating in new editions of the &quot;Supercheries littéraires&quot; of Joseph Quérard and the &quot;Dictionnaire des anonymes&quot; of Antoine Barbier. His most important bibliographical work was the &quot;Bibliographie de l&#x27;histoire de Paris pendant la Révolution française&quot; (3 vols. 1890–1901), which was crowned by the Academy of Inscriptions. This valuable work serves as a guide for the history of the city beyond the limits of the Revolution.

His other works include bibliographies of Prosper Mérimée (1876), of Théophile Gautier (1876), of the brothers de Goncourt (1897) and others; also editions of FM Grimm&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, of Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Neveu de Rameau&quot; (1884), of Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;Lettres persanes&quot; (&quot;Persian Letters&quot;, 1886), etc.

<text>X-ray bursters are one class of X-ray binary stars exhibiting X-ray bursts, periodic and rapid increases in luminosity (typically a factor of 10 or greater) that peak in the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These astrophysical systems are composed of an accreting neutron star and a main sequence companion &#x27;donor&#x27; star. There are two types of X-ray bursts, designated I and II. Type I bursts are caused by thermonuclear runaway, while type II arise from the release of gravitational (potential) energy liberated through accretion. For type I (thermonuclear) bursts, the mass transferred from the donor star accumulates on the surface of the neutron star until it ignites and fuses in a burst, producing X-rays. The behaviour of X-ray bursters is similar to the behaviour of recurrent novae. In the latter case the compact object is a white dwarf that accretes hydrogen that finally undergoes explosive burning.

The compact object of the broader class of X-ray binaries is either a neutron star or a black hole; however, with the emission of an X-ray burst, the compact object can immediately be classified as a neutron star, since black holes do not have a surface and all of the accreting material disappears past the event horizon. X-ray binaries hosting a neutron star can be further subdivided based on the mass of the donor star; either a high mass (above 10 solar masses ()) or low mass (less than ) X-ray binary, abbreviated as HMXB and LMXB, respectively.

X-ray bursts typically exhibit a sharp rise time (1–10 seconds) followed by spectral softening (a property of cooling black bodies). Individual burst energetics are characterized by an integrated flux of 1032–1033 joules, compared to the steady luminosity which is of the order 1030 W for steady accretion onto a neutron star. As such the ratio α of the burst flux to the persistent flux ranges from 10 to 1000 but is typically on the order of 100. The X-ray bursts emitted from most of these systems recur on timescales ranging from hours to days, although more extended recurrence times are exhibited in some systems, and weak bursts with recurrence times between 5–20 minutes have yet to be explained but are observed in some less usual cases. The abbreviation XRB can refer either to the object (X-ray burster) or to the associated emission (X-ray burst).

==Thermonuclear burst astrophysics==
When a star in a binary fills its Roche lobe (either due to being very close to its companion or having a relatively large radius), it begins to lose matter, which streams towards its neutron star companion. The star may also undergo mass loss by exceeding its Eddington luminosity, or through strong stellar winds, and some of this material may become gravitationally attracted to the neutron star. In the circumstance of a short orbital period and a massive partner star, both of these processes may contribute to the transfer of material from the companion to the neutron star. In both cases, the falling material originates from the surface layers of the partner star and is thus rich in hydrogen and helium. The matter streams from the donor into the accretor at the intersection of the two Roche lobes, which is also the location of the first Lagrange point, L1. Because of the revolution of the two stars around a common centre of gravity, the material then forms a jet travelling towards the accretor. Because compact stars have high gravitational fields, the material falls with a high velocity and angular momentum towards the neutron star. The angular momentum prevents it from immediately joining the surface of the accreting star. It continues to orbit the accretor in the orbital plane, colliding with other accreting material en route, thereby losing energy, and in so doing forming an accretion disk, which also lies in the orbital plane.

In an X-ray burster, this material accretes onto the surface of the neutron star, where it forms a dense layer. After mere hours of accumulation and gravitational compression, nuclear fusion starts in this matter. This begins as a stable process, the hot CNO cycle. However, continued accretion creates a degenerate shell of matter, in which the temperature rises (greater than 109 kelvin) but this does not alleviate thermodynamic conditions. This causes the triple-α cycle to quickly become favored, resulting in an helium flash. The additional energy provided by this flash allows the CNO burning to break out into thermonuclear runaway. The early phase of the burst is powered by the alpha-p process, which quickly yields to the rp-process. Nucleosynthesis can proceed as high as mass number 100, but was shown to end definitively at isotopes of tellurium that undergo alpha decay such as 107Te. Within seconds, most of the accreted material is burned, powering a bright X-ray flash that is observable with X-ray (or gamma ray) telescopes. Theory suggests that there are several burning regimes which cause variations in the burst, such as ignition condition, energy released, and recurrence, with the regimes caused by the nuclear composition, both of the accreted material and the burst ashes. This is mostly dependent on hydrogen, helium, or carbon content. Carbon ignition may also be the cause of the extremely rare &quot;superbursts&quot;.

==Observation of bursts==
Because an enormous amount of energy is released in a short period of time, much of it is released as high energy photons in accordance with the theory of black-body radiation, in this case X-rays. This release of energy powers the X-ray burst, and may be observed as in increase in the star&#x27;s luminosity with a space telescope. These bursts cannot be observed on Earth&#x27;s surface because our atmosphere is opaque to X-rays. Most X-ray bursting stars exhibit recurrent bursts because the bursts are not powerful enough to disrupt the stability or orbit of either star, and the whole process may begin again.

Most X-ray bursters have irregular burst periods, which can be on the order of a few hours to many months, depending on factors such as the masses of the stars, the distance between the two stars, the rate of accretion, and the exact composition of the accreted material. Observationally, the X-ray burst categories exhibit different features. A Type I X-ray burst has a sharp rise followed by a slow and gradual decline of the luminosity profile. A Type II X-ray burst exhibits a quick pulse shape and may have many fast bursts separated by minutes. Most observed X-ray bursts are of Type I, as Type II X-ray bursts have been observed from only two sources.

More finely detailed variations in burst observation have been recorded as the X-ray imaging telescopes improve. Within the familiar burst lightcurve shape, anomalies such as oscillations (called quasi-periodic oscillations) and dips have been observed, with various nuclear and physical explanations being offered, though none yet has been proven.

X-ray spectroscopy has revealed in bursts from EXO 0748-676 a 4 keV absorption feature and H and He-like absorption lines in Fe. The subsequent derivation of redshift of Z=0.35 implies a constraint for the mass-radius equation of the neutron star, a relationship which is still a mystery but is a major priority for the astrophysics community. However, the narrow line profiles are inconsistent with the rapid (552 Hz) spin of the neutron star in this object, and it seems more likely that the line features arise from the accretion disc.

==Applications to astronomy==
Luminous X-ray bursts can be considered standard candles, since the mass of the neutron star determines the luminosity of the burst. Therefore, comparing the observed X-ray flux to the predicted value yields relatively accurate distances. Observations of X-ray bursts also allow the determination of the radius of the neutron star.

<text>The T-54 and T-55 tanks are a series of Soviet medium tanks introduced in the years following the Second World War. The first T-54 prototype was completed at Nizhny Tagil by the end of 1945. From the late 1950s, the T-54 eventually became the main tank for armoured units of the Soviet Army, armies of the Warsaw Pact countries, and many others. T-54s and T-55s have been involved in many of the world&#x27;s armed conflicts since their introduction in the second half of the 20th century.

The T-54/55 series is the most-produced tank in history. Estimated production numbers for the series range from 96,500 to 100,000. They were replaced by the T-62, T-64, T-72, T-80 and T-90 tanks in the Soviet and Russian armies, but remain in use by up to 50 other armies worldwide, some having received sophisticated retrofitting. The Chinese version of the T-54A is the Type 59.

During the Cold War, Soviet tanks never directly faced their NATO adversaries in European combat. However, the T-54/55&#x27;s first appearance in the West around the period of the 1950s (then the beginning of the Cold War) spurred the United Kingdom to develop a new tank gun, the Royal Ordnance L7, and the United States to create the M60 tank.

==Development history==
===Predecessors: T-34 and T-44===
The Soviet T-34 medium tank of the 1940s was well regarded and development never stopped throughout the Second World War. It continued to perform well; however, the designers could not incorporate the latest technologies or major developments as vital tank production could not be interrupted during wartime.

In 1943, the Morozov Design Bureau resurrected the pre-war T-34M development project and created the T-44 tank. Thanks to a space-efficient torsion-bar suspension, a novel transverse engine mount, and the removal of the hull machine-gunner&#x27;s crew position, the T-44 had a cross-country performance at least as good as the T-34, but with substantially superior armour and a much more powerful 85 mm gun.

By the time the T-44 was ready for production, the T-34 had also been modified to fit the same gun. Although the T-44 was superior in most other ways, by this time, T-34 production was in full swing and the massive numbers of T-34s being built offset any advantage to smaller numbers of a superior design. The T-44 was produced in only small numbers, with around 200 completed in 1945. Instead, the designers continued to use the design as the basis for further improved guns, experimenting with a 122 mm design, but later deciding a 100 mm gun was a better alternative.

===Prototypes===

Efforts to fit the 100 mm gun to the T-44 demonstrated that small changes to the design would greatly improve the combination. The main issue was a larger turret ring, which suggested slightly enlarging the hull. A prototype of the new design, about longer and only 10 cm wider, was completed in 1945. This model looked almost identical to the original T-44, albeit with a larger gun.

Testing revealed several drawbacks that needed correcting and many alterations that had to be made to the vehicle&#x27;s design. It was decided to begin serial production of the new vehicle and the vehicle officially entered service in April 1946. It would go into production in Nizhny Tagil in 1947 and Kharkiv in 1948.

===T-54===
Production of the initial series of T-54s began slowly as 1,490 modifications were made. The Red Army received a tank that was superior to World War II designs and theoretically better than the newest tanks of potential opponents. The 100 mm gun fired BR-412 series full-calibre APHE ammunition, which had superior penetration ability when compared to the T-34 that it replaced.

The serial production version, designated T-54-1, differed from the second T-54 prototype. It had thicker hull armour (80 mm on the sides, 30 mm on the roof and 20 mm on the bottom). As production ramped up, quality problems emerged. Production was stopped and an improved T-54-2 (&quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 137R) version was designed. Several changes were made and a new turret was fitted. The new dome-shaped turret with flat sides was inspired by the turret from the IS-3 heavy tank; it is similar to the later T-54 turret but with a distinctive overhang at the rear. It also had a shorter bustle.

The fender machine guns were removed in favour of a single bow-mounted machine gun. The transmission was modernised and the track was widened to 580 mm. The T-54-2 entered production in 1949, at Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183 (Uralvagonzavod). In 1951, a second modernization was made, designated T-54-3 (&quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 137Sh), which had a new turret without side undercuts, and the new TSh-2-22 telescopic gunner&#x27;s sight instead of the TSh-20. The tank featured the TDA smoke-generating system. A command version was built, the T-54K (&quot;komandirskiy&quot;), with a second R-113 radio.

====T-54A and T-54B====

At the beginning of the 1950s, the personnel of the OKB-520 design bureau of the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183 (Uralvagonzavod) had been changed considerably. Morozov was replaced by Kolesnikow, who in turn was replaced by Leonid N. Kartsev in March 1953. The first decision of the new designer was to fit the 100 mm D-10T tank gun with the STP-1 &quot;Gorizont&quot; vertical stabilizer. The new tank gun received the designation D-10TG and was fitted into the T-54&#x27;s turret.

The new tank received night vision equipment for the driver and was designated T-54A (&quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 137G). Originally, this had a small muzzle counter-weight, which was later replaced with a fume extractor. It was equipped with an OPVT wading snorkel, the TSh-2A-22 telescopic sight, TVN-1 infrared driver&#x27;s periscope and IR headlight, a new R-113 radio, multi-stage engine air filter and radiator controls for improved engine performance, an electrical oil pump, a bilge pump, an automatic fire extinguisher and extra fuel tanks.

The tank officially entered production in 1954 and service in 1955. It served as a basis for the T-54AK command tank, with an additional R-112 radio set (front line tanks were equipped with an R-113 radio set), TNA-2 navigational device, ammunition load for the main gun decreased by 5 rounds and the AB-1-P/30 charging unit, which was produced in small numbers. In October 1954 a T-54A tank, designated as T-54M (&quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 139) served as a testbed for new D-54T and D-54TS 100 mm smoothbore guns and &quot;Raduga&quot; and &quot;Molniya&quot; stabilization systems, which were later used in the T-62. These were not completely successful, so further T-55 development continued to use the D-10 series guns. It was fitted with a V-54-6 engine developing 581 hp (433 kW). It never went into production.
A new version, based on T-54A, designated T-54B (&quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 137G2), was designed in 1955. It was fitted with a new 100 mm D-10T2S tank gun with STP-2 &quot;Tsyklon&quot; 2-plane stabilizer. It entered production in 1957. During the last four months of production, the new tanks were equipped with an L-2 &quot;Luna&quot; infrared searchlight, a TPN-1-22-11 IR gunner&#x27;s sight, and an OU-3 IR commander&#x27;s searchlight. Modern APFSDS ammunition was developed, dramatically enhancing the penetrative performance of the gun to keep it competitive with NATO armour developments. T-54B served as the basis for the T-54BK command tank, which had the same additional equipment as the T-54AK command tank.

===T-55===
Trials with nuclear weapons showed that a T-54 could survive a 2–15 kt nuclear charge at a range of more than from the epicentre, but the crew had a chance of surviving at a minimum of . It was decided to create an NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) protection system which would start working 0.3 seconds after detecting gamma radiation.

The task of creating a basic PAZ (&quot;Protivoatomnaya Zashchita&quot;) NBC protection system offering protection against the blast of a nuclear weapon and (radioactive) particulate filtration, but not against external gamma radiation or gas, was given to the KB-60 design bureau in Kharkiv and was completed in 1956. The documentation was sent to Uralvagonzavod. It was decided to increase the tank&#x27;s abilities by changing its construction and introducing new production technologies. Those changes were initially tested on the T-54M (&quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 139).

The tank was fitted with the new V-55 12-cylinder four-stroke one-chamber, 38.88-litre water-cooled diesel engine developing 581 hp (433 kW). Engine power was increased by raising the pressure of the fuel delivery and charging degree. The designers planned to introduce a heating system for the engine compartment and MC-1 diesel fuel filter. The engine was to be started pneumatically using an AK-150S charger and an electric starter. This eliminated the need for the tank to carry a tank filled with air. To allow easier access during maintenance and repairs, it was decided to change hatches over the engine compartment. To increase the operational range, fuel tanks were added to the front of the hull, increasing the overall fuel capacity to .

The ammunition load for the main gun was increased from 34 to 45, with 18 shells stored in so-called &quot;wet containers&quot; located in hull fuel tanks (the concept for which came from Kartsev&#x27;s cancelled &quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 140). The ammunition load included high explosive-fragmentation and anti-tank rounds and designers also planned to introduce the BK5M high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds which penetrated thick armour. The TPKU commander&#x27;s vision device was replaced by either the TPKUB or TPKU-2B. The gunner received a TNP-165 vision device.

The loader&#x27;s hatch-mounted 12.7 mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy machine gun was dropped, because it was deemed worthless against high-performance jets. The tank was supposed to have the &quot;Rosa&quot; fire protection system. The tank had a thicker turret casting, an improved two-plane gun stabilization system from the T-54B and night vision fighting equipment. To balance the weight of the new equipment, the armour on the back of the hull was thinned slightly.

The T-55 was superior to the IS-2, IS-3 and T-10 heavy tanks in many respects, including the gun&#x27;s rate of fire (at least four compared to fewer than three rounds per minute). Despite somewhat thinner frontal turret armour ( instead of ), it compared favourably with the IS-3, due to its improved antitank gun and better mobility. Heavy tanks soon fell from favour.

This became the &quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 155 and entered production at Uralvagonzavod on 1 January 1958 as the T-55. It was accepted for service with the Red Army on 8 May. It suffered a significant lapse in one area: there was no antiaircraft machine gun, which had been present on the T-54.

After 1959, it served as a basis for the T-55K command tank equipped with an additional R-112 radio set, an AB-1-P/30 fuel-powered accumulator charging unit and a TPN-1-22-11 night vision sight. All this extra equipment made it necessary to decrease the ammunition load for the main gun to 37 rounds and eliminate the bow machine gun. At the beginning of the 1960s, a T-55K was experimentally fitted with a &quot;Uran&quot; TV relay apparatus for battlefield surveillance. The tank was equipped with an external camera, the picture from which was relayed to a receiver in a BTR-50PU command vehicle. There was an observation camera mounted on a folding mast which was in turn mounted on a UAZ 69 car.

In 1961, a T-55 tank was used to test the &quot;Almaz&quot; TV complex, which was supposed to replace the standard observation devices right after a nuclear explosion or while fording a body of water. There was a camera mounted on the hull for the driver and two cameras mounted on the turret, one for aiming and one for observation, and the picture from the cameras was relayed to two control screens. The tank had the front hull fuel tanks and bow machine gun removed. The commander was seated in the driver&#x27;s usual position while the driver sat beside him.

The cameras allowed battlefield observation and firing during daytime at ranges between . Because of the low quality of the equipment, the trials gave negative results. At the beginning of the 1960s, the OKB-29 design bureau in Omsk adapted the tank to use a GTD-3T gas turbine engine developing 700 hp (522 kW). One T-55 tank fitted with this gas turbine engine passed trials but was deemed unsatisfactory, and the design did not go into production.

The Omsk OKB-29 group tested three experimental T-55 tanks (designated &quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 612) between 1962 and 1965 that were fitted with an automatic gearbox controlled by electro-hydraulic systems. The trials found that such gearboxes were prone to frequent breakdowns in tanks. At the same time, the &quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 155ML, a T-55 fitted with a launcher for three 9M14 &quot;Malyutka&quot; (NATO code: AT-3 Sagger) ATGMs mounted on the rear of the turret, was tested. Along with standard tanks, a flamethrower-armed version was designed (designated TO-55 (&quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 482)) and produced until 1962. It was fitted with 460-litre tanks filled with flammable liquid instead of the frontal hull fuel tanks. The flamethrower replaced the coaxial machine gun. This was a much better way to mount a flamethrower than in the experimental &quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 483, based on the T-54 tank, where the flamethrower replaced the main gun. TO-55 flamethrower tanks were withdrawn from service in 1993.

====T-55A====
In 1961, the development of improved NBC protection systems began. The goal was to protect the crew from fast neutrons; adequate protection against gamma radiation was provided by the thick armour and a PAZ basic NBC protection system.

The POV plasticized lead antiradiation lining was developed to provide the needed protection. It was installed in the interior, requiring the driver&#x27;s hatch and the coamings over the turret hatches to be noticeably enlarged. This liner had the added benefit of protecting the crew from fragments of penetrated armour.

The tank was equipped with a full PAZ/FVU chemical filtration system. The coaxial 7.62 mm SGMT machine gun was replaced by a 7.62 mm PKT machine gun. The hull was lengthened from 6.04 m to 6.2 m. The hull machine gun was removed, making space for six more main gun rounds. These changes increased the weight of the vehicle to 38 tonnes.

The design work was done by the OKB-520 design bureau of Uralvagonzavod under the leadership of Leonid N. Kartsev. The T-55A served as the basis for the T-55AK command tank.

===T-54/T-55 upgrades===

In its long service life, the T-55 has been upgraded many times. Early T-55s were fitted with a new TSh-2B-32P sight. In 1959, some tanks received mountings for the PT-55 mine clearing system or the BTU/BTU-55 plough. In 1967, the improved 3BM-8 APDS round, which could penetrate 275 mm thick armour at a range of 2 km, was introduced. In 1970, new and old T-55 tanks had the loader&#x27;s hatch modified to mount the 12.7 mm DShK machine gun, to deal with the threat of attack helicopters. Starting in 1974, T-55 tanks received the KTD-1 or KTD-2 laser rangefinder in an armoured box over the mantlet of the main gun, and the R-123 or R-123M radio set. Simultaneously, efforts were made to modernize and increase the lifespan of the drive train.

During production, the T-55A was frequently modernised. In 1965, a new track was introduced that could be used for between 2,000 km and 3,000 km, which was twice the range of the old track. It needed a new drive sprocket, with 14 teeth instead of 13. Since 1974, T-55A tanks were equipped with a KTD-1 &quot;Newa&quot; rangefinder and a TSzS-32PM sight. All T-55A tanks were equipped with the TPN-1-22-11 night sight. The R-113 radio set was replaced by a R-123 radio set. Late production models had rubber side skirts and a driver&#x27;s windshield for use during longer stints.

T-54 and T-55 tanks continued to be upgraded, refitted, and modernised into the 1990s. Advances in armour-piercing and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shaped charge ammunition would improve the gun&#x27;s antitank abilities in the 1960s and 1980s.

A wide array of upgrades in different price ranges are provided by many manufacturers in different countries, intended to bring the T-54/55 up to the abilities of newer MBTs, at a lower cost. Upgrades include new engines, explosive reactive armour, new main armament such as 120 mm or 125 mm guns, active protection systems, and fire control systems with range-finders or thermal sights. These improvements make it a potent main battle tank (MBT) for the low-end budget, even to this day.

One of these upgrade packages was a joint United States-China prototype designed and built by Cadillac Gage, now known as Textron. Two prototypes based on the Chinese Type 59 tank, a clone of the Soviet Union era T-55, named Jaguar were produced in Detroit, Michigan. Modifications included a new turret design and an improved hull. The engine compartment and fuel tanks on the shelves over the tracks were armour-protected. The Soviet-made 100 mm gun was replaced with the American M68 105 mm rifled gun fitted with a thermal sleeve. A Marconi fire control system which was originally developed for the American light tank Stingray was fitted. The vehicle incorporated a Cadillac Gage weapon stabilizer and a gunner&#x27;s sight equipped with an integral laser rangefinder. The powertrain was replaced with a Detroit Diesel 8V-92TA engine and XTG-411 automatic transmission. In 1989, two prototypes were completed. The chassis were provided by PRC, while the hull tops, turrets and powerplants were manufactured by Cadillac Gage Textron. Field testing of the prototypes began in October 1989, four months after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, which ended cooperation between China and Cadillac Gage.

Another prototype upgrade package was produced by Teledyne Continental Motors (now General Dynamics Land Systems) for the Egyptian Army and was known as the T-54E. After further modifications and trials it was sent into mass production and received the designation Ramses II.

As late as 2013, Ukrainian companies were reportedly developing T-55 main battle tank upgrades targeting the export market. The Type 59 is still in production, in several variants.

==Description==

The T-54 and T-55 have a cabin layout shared with many post-World War II tanks, with the fighting compartment in the front, the engine compartment in the rear, and a dome-shaped turret in the hull&#x27;s centre. The driver&#x27;s hatch is on the front left of the hull roof. In the turret, the commander is seated on the left, with the gunner to his front and the loader on the right. The tank has a &quot;flat track&quot;, meaning no support rollers, the suspension has the drive sprocket at the rear and dead track. The engine exhaust is on the left fender. There is a prominent gap between the first and second road wheel pairs, a distinguishing feature from the T-62, which has progressively larger spaces between road wheels towards the rear.

The T-54 and T-55 tanks are outwardly similar and difficult to distinguish visually. Soviet tanks were factory-overhauled every 7,000 km and usually given minor technology updates. Many states have added or modified the tank&#x27;s equipment; India, for example, affixed fake fume extractors to its T-54s and T-55s so that its gunners would not confuse them with Pakistani Type 59s.

The older T-54 can be distinguished from the T-55 by a dome-shaped ventilator on the front right of the turret and a driver-operated SGMT 7.62 mm machine gun mounted to fire through a tiny hole in the centre of the hull&#x27;s front. Early T-54s lacked a gun fume extractor, had an undercut at the turret&#x27;s rear, and a distinctive &quot;pig-snout&quot; gun mantlet.

===Advantages and drawbacks===

By 1950s standards, the T-54 was excellent, packing considerable firepower and armour protection in a reliable design whilst also being smaller and lighter than contemporary NATO designs. However, at the time, the T-54 lacked effective sub-calibre ammunition and was reliant on HEAT rounds for anti-tank ammunition until the 1960s. This and the fact that the T-54 had a simple fire-control system meant that the T-54 was inaccurate at longer ranges.

The T-55 introduced the world&#x27;s first first-generation protective suite for NBC protection. This was done due to Soviet researchers finding that the survivability of tanks and their crews against tactical nuclear weapons was poor.

The low turret profile of the tanks prevents them from depressing their main guns by more than 5° since the breech would strike the ceiling when fired, which limits the ability to cover terrain by fire from a hull-down position on a reverse slope. As with most tanks of that generation, the internal ammunition supply is not shielded, increasing the risk that any enemy penetration of the fighting compartment could cause a catastrophic secondary explosion. The T-54 lacked NBC protection and a turret basket, which meant that crewmen had to physically rotate and keep up with a rotating turret as the hull they stood in didn&#x27;t move with the turret. Additionally, early models also lacked gun stabilisation. Most of these problems were corrected in the otherwise largely identical T-55 tank.

Together, the T-54/55 tanks have been manufactured by the tens of thousands, and many remain in reserve or even in front-line use among lower-technology fighting forces. Abundance and age together make these tanks cheap and easy to purchase.

==Production history==
===Soviet Union===
T-54-1 production was slow at first, as only 3 vehicles were built in 1946 and 22 in 1947. 285 T-54-1 tanks were built in 1948 by Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183 (Uralvagonzavod); by then it had completely replaced T-44 production at Uralvagonzavod, and Kharkiv Diesel Factory No. 75 (KhPZ). Production was stopped because of a low level of production quality and frequent breakdowns. The T-54-2 entered production in 1949 at Uralvagonzavod, which produced 423 tanks by the end of 1950. It replaced the T-34 in production at the Omsk Factory No. 183 in 1950. In 1951, over 800 T-54-2 tanks were produced. The T-54-2 remained in production until 1952. The T-54A was produced between 1955 and 1957. The T-54B was produced between 1957 and April 1959. The T-55 was produced by Uralvagonzavod between 1958 and 1962. The T-55K command tank was produced in 1959. The TO-55 (&quot;Ob&#x27;yekt&quot; 482) flamethrower tank was produced until 1962.

Overall, 35,000 T-54-1, T-54-2, T-54 (T-54-3), T-54A, T-54B, T-54AK1, T-54AK2, T-54BK1 and T-54BK2 tanks were produced between 1946 and 1958 and 27,500 T-55, T-55A, T-55K1, T-55K2, T-55K3, T-55AK1, T-55AK2 and T-55AK3 tanks were produced between 1955 and 1981.

===Polish People&#x27;s Republic===

Polish People&#x27;s Republic produced 3,000 T-54, T-54A, T-54AD and T-54AM tanks between 1956 and 1964 and 7,000 T-55 (between 1964 and 1968), T-55L, T-55AD-1 and T-55AD-2 tanks (between 1968 and 1979).

===Czechoslovakia===
Czechoslovakia produced 2,700 T-54A, T-54AM, T-54AK, T-54AMK tanks (between 1957 and 1966) and 8,300 T-55 and T-55A tanks (between 1964 and 1983; T-55A was probably produced since 1968). Most of them were for export.

== Service history ==

===Soviet Union and successors===
The T-54/55 and the T-62 were the two most common tanks in Soviet inventory—in the mid-1970s the two tank types together comprised approximately 85% of the Soviet Army&#x27;s tanks.

Soviet T-54 tanks first saw combat in the Hungarian Revolution in 1956 and a few were successfully knocked out by the defending anti-Soviet Hungarian resistance fighters and rebels using Molotov cocktails and several anti-tank guns. The local anti-Soviet revolutionaries delivered one captured T-54A to the British Embassy in Budapest, the analyses and studies of which helped and spurred the development of the Royal Ordnance L7 105 mm tank gun.

At the initial stage of the war in Afghanistan in 1979–1980, about 800 Soviet tanks were used, consisting of 39 battalions, mainly armed with T-54s and T-55s. In 1979, only one T-55 tank was lost. Since the beginning of 1980, they began to be replaced by modern T-62 and T-64 tanks.

In Russia, most of the T-62 and the T-55 were auctioned off in 2012, with all Russian active-duty military units mainly operating the T-72, the T-80 and the T-90. Remaining T-62s, T-55s and T-54s in storage have been reactivated to be used in combat in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In Ukraine, in 1997 &quot;The Military Balance&quot; reported that Ukraine had 154 T-55 tanks, but by 2014 the number was only 20, all in store.

===Middle East===
During the 1967 Six-Day War, U.S.-supplied M48 Patton tanks, British Centurion tanks, and even upgraded World War II–era 75 mm M-50 and 105 mm armed M-51 Super Shermans faced T-55s. This mix of Israeli tanks, combined with superior planning of operations and superior airpower, proved to be more than capable of dealing with the T-54/T-55 series.

During the Jordanian Civil War, Syrian tanks inflicted heavy losses on Jordanian Centurions. In one case, a squadron of T-55s stopped the advance of a large Jordanian column, with 19 Centurions destroyed and up to 10 Syrian T-55s lost in the battle. According to Israeli intelligence, Jordan lost 75 to 90 tanks out of 200 involved, most to Syrian T-55 fire at ar-Ramtha. In turn total Syrian tank losses accounted to 62 T-55 mostly breakdowns left on enemy territory.

By the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the T-54A and T-55&#x27;s guns were losing their competitive effectiveness relative to the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun mounted in Israeli Centurion Mk V and M60A1 tanks. Israeli tanks fitted with the L7 105mm gun suffered greatly from the new Soviet HEAT 3BК5 ammunition fired by the T-55s. During the entire war, 1,063 Israeli tanks were disabled (more than half of them Centurions), about 600 of which were destroyed or captured. Some 35 Israeli Centurions were captured by Egypt, dozens more were captured by Syria, Iraq and four by Jordan. On the other hand, 2,250 Arab tanks were disabled (including 33 Jordanian Centurions, 18 of them destroyed), 1,274 of them were completely destroyed or captured (643 tanks were lost in the north and 631 were lost in the south)

Israel captured many from Egypt in 1967, along with a few T-55s from Syria, and kept some of them in service. They were upgraded with a 105 mm NATO-standard L7 or M68, a US version of the L7, replacing the old Soviet 100 mm D-10, and a General Motors diesel replacing the original Soviet diesel engine. The Israelis designated these &quot;Tiran-5&quot; medium tanks, and they were used by reserve units until the early 1990s. Most of these were then sold to assorted Third World countries, some of them in Latin America, and the rest were heavily modified, converted into the &quot;Achzarit&quot; heavy armoured personnel carrier.

In the Lebanese Civil War, on 10 June 1982, eight Israeli M48A3s, two M60A1s and at least three M113 APCs were lost in an ambush by Syrian T-55 tanks and BMP-1 APCs during the Battle of Sultan Yacoub.

The tank was heavily used during the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–88. T-54/55 participated in the biggest tank battle of the war in early 1981. Iran lost 214 Chieftain and M60A1 tanks in the battle. In return, Iraq lost 45 T-55 and T-62 tanks. Another known tank battle occurred on 11 October 1980, when a large Iranian convoy supported by a battalion of Chieftains (92nd Division) was ambushed by a battalion of Iraqi T-55s (26th Brigade). During the battle, the Iranians lost 20 Chieftains plus other armoured vehicles and withdrew.

Many Iraqi T-55s saw action during Operation Desert Storm in Iraq and Kuwait in January/February 1991, and during the 2003 US/UK invasion of Iraq with poor results.

===Vietnam War===

During the Vietnam War, the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and its proxy military force, the Liberation Army of South Vietnam (LASV), used T-54s, along with its Chinese-built copy (the Type 59), extensively against the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and their allied US forces.

The PAVN/LASV and the ARVN engaged each other with tanks for the first time during Operation Lam Son 719 in February 1971. During that battle, 17 M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks of the ARVN&#x27;s 1st Armoured Brigade claimed to have destroyed 22 PAVN tanks, a total of 6 T-54s and 16 PT-76 light amphibious tanks, at no loss to themselves, but their friendly units lost 5 M41s and 25 armoured personnel carriers (APCs), mainly M113 APCs.

On Easter Sunday, 2 April 1972, the newly activated ARVN 20th Tank Regiment, comprising approximately 57 M48A3 Patton main battle tanks (note that ARVN &quot;regiments&quot; were equivalent to US &quot;battalions&quot;, and ARVN &quot;squadrons&quot; were comparable to US &quot;companies&quot; or &quot;troops&quot;) received reports from friendly intelligence units of a large PAVN armoured column moving towards Dong Ha, the largest South Vietnamese city near the Vietnamese DMZ located on the 17th Parallel. At about noontime, the tank crewmen of the ARVN&#x27;s 1st Squadron observed enemy armour moving south along Highway 1 towards Dong Ha and promptly concealed their tanks on high ground with a good vantage point against their enemy. Waiting for the PAVN tank column to close to between 2500 and 3000 meters, the 90mm main guns of the Patton tanks opened fire and quickly destroyed nine PT-76s and two T-54s. The surviving PAVN armour, unable to locate their enemy&#x27;s positions, hastily turned about and withdrew shortly afterwards.

On 9 April 1972, all three squadrons of the 20th Tank Regiment (57 M48 tanks) fought hard against enemy armour, firing upon PAVN tanks accompanied by large masses of infantry, again while occupying the strategically important high ground. This time, similarly, the Pattons opened fire at approximately 2800 meters. A few answering shots from the T-54s fell short and the PAVN tanks began to scatter after suffering considerable losses and heavy casualties. By the end of the day, the 20th claimed to destroy sixteen T-54s and captured one Type 59 at no loss to themselves. (The PAVN confirmed six tanks were destroyed or damaged) On 27 April, heralded by massive artillery attacks, a new PAVN offensive began against ARVN positions. The barrage was quickly followed by violent attacks by PAVN infantry and a T-54 tank. By 2 May, the 20th Tank Regiment had lost all of their tanks to enemy fire. During the first month of the First Battle of Quảng Trị, all ARVN M48 Pattons (100 tanks) were lost.

PAVN armoured units equipped with the T-54 tank achieved one of their largest victories in April 1972 when the PAVN 203rd Armoured Regiment attacked the ARVN&#x27;s 22nd Infantry Division based at Tân Cảnh Base Camp, which dominated a main route into the city of Kon Tum, located near the 17th Parallel. After a two-day-long intense artillery barrage, eighteen T-54 tanks attacked the camp at dawn from two different directions, thus breaking apart the ARVN unit into two and splitting up its forces, which quickly abandoned its positions and withdrew. T-54 tank No. 377 had managed to destroy seven ARVN M41s before it was finally destroyed by M72 LAW anti-tank rocket launchers fielded by the South Vietnamese infantry. The PAVN destroyed 18 M41 light tanks with 31 M113 APCs and captured 17 M41s intact while losing only two T-54 tanks and one PT-76 tank in the armoured skirmish.

At the very end of the war on 30 April 1975, a PAVN T-54 smashed through the main gate of the RVN Presidential Palace in the capital city of Saigon, accompanied by onrushing North Vietnamese troops after North Vietnam conquered the South. This widely seen image has come to be regarded by many as perhaps the defining moment of the end of the bloody 20-year-long conflict in Vietnam and the fall of the Republic of Vietnam. During the war, PAVN tank units were involved in 211 battles, claimed 20,000+ enemy killed, destroyed more than 2,000 enemy tanks/APCs, 870 other military vehicles, and 3,500 enemy bunkers, and shot down 35 aircraft or helicopters, overwhelmingly using T-54s. The PAVN lost an estimated 250 (1972 - 150, 1973-1975 - 100) T-54s during the war.

Following the Vietnam War, Vietnam&#x27;s T-54/55s and Type 59s continued to see much combat activity against neighbouring Cambodia and China to their north between 1978 and 1979. Just like many developing countries around the world which continue to operate the T-54/55, at least 900 T-54s, along with a similar number of T-55s and Type 59s, are still in active military service with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam until the present day. Some of them are slated to be replaced by the more modern T-90S/SK.

===Ogaden War===
During the largest tank battle of the Ogaden War – the Battle of Jijiga (August–September 1977), 124 Somali tanks, mostly T-55s, defeated 108 Ethiopian tanks, mainly M47 Pattons and M41 Walker Bulldogs. The Ethiopians lost 43 tanks during the battle.

===Angola===
T-54/T-55s began appearing in Southern Africa in the late 1970s, when many emerging Marxist states, particularly Angola and Mozambique, were bolstered with modern Soviet military hardware. The T-55&#x27;s dependability and ruggedness proved well-suited to the local combat environments. Survivability of opposing medium-armour vehicles deployed by UNITA and the South African Defence Force (SADF) against late model MBTs used in the Angolan Civil War remained a major concern throughout that conflict. Angolan Army T-54s were first blooded during Operation Askari, in 1981. At least five were subsequently destroyed in encounters with South African Eland or Ratel-90 armoured cars, and some were captured. Soviet sources confirm that many T-55s were penetrated by an Eland&#x27;s 90 mm low-pressure gun. Nevertheless, multiple HEAT rounds were needed to guarantee sufficient damage against a T-55&#x27;s frontal arc and SADF anti-tank teams forced to operate in platoons accordingly.

During the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, another three T-55s of Angola&#x27;s 21st Brigade were shot out by Ratel IFVs armed with ZT3 Ingwe ATGMs near the Lomba River. On 9 November 1987, an engagement between South African and Angolan tanks occurred when thirteen Olifant Mk1As eliminated two T-55s in a nine-minute skirmish. T-55s again participated in a critical engagement near Cuito Cuanavale on 14 February 1988, when Cuba&#x27;s 3rd Tank Battalion counter-attacked to spare Angola&#x27;s 16th Brigade virtual annihilation by 61 Mechanised Infantry Battalion Group and the 4th South African Infantry Battalion. Six T-55s were lost (three to RPGs, three to Olifants and one more was damaged), but the attack blunted the South African advance, safeguarding the cohesion of the Angolan line. Cuban and Soviet sources maintain that they destroyed ten Olifant tanks and twelve Ratels, while South African and Western sources maintain that only one Olifant and one Ratel were damaged, and one Ratel destroyed.

===India and Pakistan===
The Indian Army has used their T-54s and T-55s extensively in its conflicts with Pakistan between the 1970s to the 1980s. Pakistan also used some T-54As and Chinese Type 59 copies.

At one point India added fake bore evacuators to its tanks, to enable them to be distinguished easily from Pakistan&#x27;s tanks.

The first meeting of the T-55 with enemy tanks occurred in the area of Garibpur on 22 November 1971. Indian T-55 tanks (63 Cavalry) destroyed 3 Pakistani M24 Chaffee tanks (29 Cavalry) in the area.

On 10–11 December, during the Battle of Nainakot, Indian T-55s (14 Cavalry Scinde Horse) in two battles destroyed 9 Pakistani M47/48 tanks (33 Cavalry), without any loss.

Battle of Basantar, also known as the Battle of Barapind (4–16 December 1971), was one of the vital battles fought as part of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 in the western sector of India. India had destroyed close to 46 M48 tanks and losing only 10 tanks in the process.

At the end of the war, one of the last tank battles took place in the Naogaon area, a company of Pakistani Chaffee tanks attacked Indian T-55s but lost 5 Chaffee tanks and was forced to retreat to Bogra.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===
On 7 July 2014, a T-54 from a museum in Donetsk was commissioned into the Russian people&#x27;s militias.

Footage from the Battle of Mariupol (May 2022) indicates that Ukrainian soldiers used a single T-54 which had previously been converted to a historical memorial at the Azovstal plant. The tank was removed from the pedestal, probably towed to its combat position and used by Ukrainian fighters for defence. According to the few existing pictures, the vehicle was heavily damaged in combat and abandoned.

Ukrainian soldiers trained with 28 M-55S tanks delivered in October 2022 by Slovenia. The Model M-55S is a heavily reinforced tank that has been updated with a NATO L7 105 mm gun, upgraded armour protection, a digital ballistic computer, an upgraded engine and new tracks. In December 2022 the volunteer 47th Assault Brigade was equipped with 28 M-55S. On 14 July 2023, an M-55S received a direct hit into the upper armour by a 152 mm guided Krasnopol Russian artillery shell. The tank and crew survived due to reactive armour upgrades. A few days later on 22 July, a second Ukrainian M-55S took a direct hit west of Kreminna and exploded.

On 21–22 March 2023, photos and videos of a Russian military train with T-54s and T-54Bs appeared on social media, and an interview by Volya Media seems to confirm the intention of deploying them to Ukraine. Images of T-55 in Ukraine first emerged in April 2023 confirming their deployment by the Russian armed forces. On 19 June, footage of a Russian T-54/55 converted into a remote-controlled VBIED being destroyed by Ukrainian forces near Marinka, Donetsk Oblast was released.

As of February 2025, Russia is visually confirmed to have suffered 13 T-55 losses (2 T-54-3M, 2 T-54B, 3 T-55A,1 T-55A Obr. 1981, and 5 unknown T-54/55).

An analysis of Russian armour tactics in Ukraine by the Royal United Services Institute claimed that Russian T-55s are not deployed as front-line armour assets but as assault guns attached to infantry formations. RUSI further claimed it is due to shortages of Russian infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), which normally fulfil the role of providing organic fire support to infantry. The T-55s&#x27; main armament range and optics are superior to those of many Russian IFVs such as the BMP-2, prompting Russian commanders to favour using them in support of infantry engagements at longer standoff ranges, where they cannot be easily countered by Ukrainian man-portable anti-tank weapons.

===Other conflicts===
T-54 tanks were used during the Cambodian Civil War and the Cambodian–Vietnamese War between the 1970s to the 1980s. During the Uganda–Tanzania War of 1978 to 1979, Libya sent an expeditionary military force to aid Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in his conflict with Tanzania, which included the supply of a few dozen T-54/55 tanks. Some of these tanks saw action against Tanzanian forces., with at least limited success.

In Poland in 1983–83, T-55L tanks were deployed during the imposition of martial law to intimidate the population (seemingly growing ever-more anti-communist) and to suppress overt displays against their communist government.

The T-55 was the most numerous tank of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA). It was the mainstay of armoured combat units during the Yugoslav Wars, where it proved vulnerable to infantry equipped with anti-tank rockets and weaponry and to misemployment in urban areas and unfriendly terrain. But there were too many of them in service for them to be replaced entirely. During the Battle of Vukovar, where the JNA grouped a large part of its tank force, several were destroyed, almost exclusively by infantry-carried anti-tank weapons. The T-55 tank remained the most common tank in the armies of the various Yugoslavian successor states until recently, and it was the most used tank by all armies during the decades-long wars. T-55s were also used by Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War and Macedonia (now North Macedonia) during the 2001 insurgency in Macedonia and by Russian peacekeepers after the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo. The Kosovo Liberation Army (National Liberation Army of Kosovo) captured a T-55 from the Macedonian Army during the battle of Raduša.

The T-55 has been used by Ethiopia in the conflict with the Islamic Courts Union in Somalia and used by various warring factions in the Somali Civil War after the fall of the dictatorial Siad Barre regime in the 1990s.

China produced thousands of Type 59 tanks (based on the Soviet T-54A) for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which were used during the Vietnam War and used en-masse against Vietnam in the Sino-Vietnamese War and sold the similar (but upgraded) Type 69 tanks to both Iran and Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War between 1980 and 1988. A considerable number saw action against Coalition forces during Operation Desert Storm in Iraq and Kuwait in January and February 1991 and during the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 (Operation Iraqi Freedom), with an abysmal showing against more modern tanks fielded by US and British troops, such as the M1 Abrams and the Challenger 1 and Challenger 2 tanks.

The Sri Lanka Army acquired 25 T-55As and 2 T-55 ARVs from Czechoslovakia in 1991, forming its first tank unit, the 4th Armoured Regiment of the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps. The T-55s were first used in Operation Balavegaya II in an offensive capacity. Due to the operation demands of the escalating Sri Lankan Civil War, T-55As of the regiment were deployed in pairs to forward bases to support infantry with limited training. This resulted in the capture of two T-55A tanks by the LTTE in the Battle of Pooneryn in November 1993. One of these was destroyed soon after by the Sri Lanka Air Force, while the other was operated by the LTTE until the last days of the war when it was re-captured. The T-55s spearheaded Operation Riviresa. In 2000, the army acquired Czech T-55AM2s deployed in offensive operations supporting infantry during the pitch battles of the last stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War including the Battle of Jaffna.

T-55 tanks have seen use on both sides of the 2011 Libyan civil war, with anti-Gaddafi forces either stealing them or having them contributed by defecting members of the Libyan Army.

T-55s have been used by the Sudanese Armed Forces during the conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile. At least 4 were captured and 1 destroyed by the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement-North on 10 December 2012.

The T-55 has seen active combat service with the of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, supported by the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade (UN FIB), in 2013–14 during the campaign to suppress the March 23 Movement (M23) rebel group.

Russia announced that several T-55 tanks used by ISIL in Syria were destroyed in an air attack conducted by its forces on 5 October 2015.

==Operators and variants==
The T-55 has been used worldwide by as many as 50 countries and quasi-armies. They have been subject to many improvements throughout their production history and afterwards, and many are still in service today.

Modifications to the T-54/55 series over the years have changed almost every aspect of the vehicle. Initially, Soviet modifications included a better turret shape, improved NBC protection and an improved powerplant. Later, enhanced fire-control equipment and night-vision equipment was added.

Foreign improvements, both in Warsaw Pact nations and elsewhere, have further improved protection, powerplant, and firepower. T-54/55s have been re-armed with improved tank guns, AA machine guns, advanced armour arrays, and technologies, such as laser range finders and computerized fire control systems, that did not exist when the tank was first being built in the early days of the Cold War.

<text>In photography and cinematography, a wide-angle lens is a lens covering a large angle of view. Conversely, its focal length is substantially smaller than that of a normal lens for a given film plane. This type of lens allows more of the scene to be included in the photograph, which is useful in architectural, interior, and landscape photography where the photographer may not be able to move farther from the scene to photograph it.

Another use is where the photographer wishes to emphasize the difference in size or distance between objects in the foreground and the background; nearby objects appear very large and objects at a moderate distance appear small and far away.

This exaggeration of relative size can be used to make foreground objects more prominent and striking, while capturing expansive backgrounds.

A wide-angle lens is also one that projects a substantially larger image circle than would be typical for a standard design lens of the same focal length. This large image circle enables either large tilt &amp; shift movements with a view camera.

By convention, in still photography, the normal lens for a particular format has a focal length approximately equal to the length of the diagonal of the image frame or digital photosensor. In cinematography, a lens of roughly twice the diagonal is considered &quot;normal&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Longer lenses magnify the subject more, apparently compressing distance and (when focused on the foreground) blurring the background because of their shallower depth of field. Wider lenses tend to magnify the distance between objects while allowing greater depth of field.

Another result of using a wide-angle lens is a greater apparent perspective distortion when the camera is not aligned perpendicularly to the subject: parallel lines converge at the same rate as with a normal lens but converge more due to the wider total field. For example, buildings appear to be falling backward much more severely when the camera is pointed upward from ground level than they would if photographed with a normal lens at the same distance from the subject because more of the subject building is visible in the wide-angle shot.

Because different lenses generally require a different camera–subject distance to preserve the size of a subject, changing the angle of view can indirectly distort perspective, changing the apparent relative size of the subject and foreground.

== Wide-angle lenses for 35 mm format ==

For a full-frame 35 mm camera with a 36 mm by 24 mm format, the diagonal measures 43.3 mm, and by custom, the normal lens adopted by most manufacturers is 50 mm. Also by custom, a lens of focal length 35 mm or less is considered wide-angle.

Ultra wide angle lenses have a focal length shorter than the short side of the film or sensor. In 35 mm, an ultra wide-angle lens has a focal length shorter than 24 mm.

Common wide-angle lenses for a full-frame 35 mm camera are 35, 28, 24, 21, 20, 18, and 14 mm, the latter four being ultra-wide.
Many of the lenses in this range will produce a more or less rectilinear image at the film plane, though some degree of barrel distortion is not uncommon.

Ultra wide-angle lenses that do not produce a rectilinear image (i.e., exhibit barrel distortion) are called fisheye lenses. Common focal lengths for these in a 35 mm camera is 6 to 8 mm (which produce a circular image). Lenses with focal lengths of 8 to 16 mm may be either rectilinear or fisheye designs.

Wide-angle lenses come in both fixed-focal-length and zoom varieties. For 35 mm cameras, lenses producing rectilinear images can be found at focal lengths as short as 8 mm, including zoom lenses with ranges of 2:1 that begin at 12 mm.

== Digital camera considerations ==

, many interchangeable-lens digital cameras have image sensors that are smaller than the film format of full-frame 35 mm cameras. For the most part, the dimensions of these image sensors are similar to the APS-C image frame size, i.e., approximately 24 mm x 16 mm. Therefore, the angle of view for any given focal-length lens will be narrower than it would be in a full-frame camera because the smaller sensor &quot;sees&quot; less of the image projected by the lens. The camera manufacturers provide a crop factor (sometimes called a field-of-view factor or a focal-length multiplier) to show how much smaller the sensor is than a full 35 mm film frame. For example, one common factor is 1.5 (Nikon DX format and some others), although many cameras have crop factors of 1.6 (most Canon DSLRs), 1.7 (the early Sigma DSLRs) and 2 (the Four Thirds and Micro Four Thirds cameras). The 1.5 indicates that the angle of view of a lens on the camera is the same as that of a 1.5 times longer focal length on a 35 mm full-frame camera, which explains why the crop factor is also known as a focal-length multiplier. For example, a 28 mm lens on the DSLR (given a crop factor of 1.5) would produce the angle of view of a 42 mm lens on a full-frame camera. So, to determine the focal length of a lens for a digital camera that will give the equivalent angle of view as one on a full-frame camera, the full-frame lens focal length must be divided by the crop factor. For example, to get the equivalent angle of view of a 30 mm lens on a full-frame 35 mm camera, from a digital camera with a 1.5 crop factor, one would use a 20 mm lens.

Lens manufacturers have responded by making wide-angle lenses of much shorter focal lengths for these cameras. In doing this, they limit the diameter of the image projected to slightly more than the diagonal measurement of the photosensor. This gives the designers more flexibility in providing the optical corrections necessary to economically produce high-quality images at these short focal lengths, especially when the lenses are zoom lenses. Examples are 10 mm minimum focal length zoom lenses from several manufacturers. At 10 mm, these lenses provide the angle of view of a 15 mm lens on a full-frame camera when the crop factor is 1.5.

== Construction ==
There are two varieties of wide-angle lens: short-focus lenses and retrofocus lenses.
Short-focus lenses are generally made up of multiple glass elements whose shapes are more or less symmetrical in front of and behind the diaphragm. As the focal length decreases, the distance of the rear element of the lens from the film plane or digital sensor also decreases.

This makes short-focus wide-angle lenses undesirable for single-lens reflex cameras unless they are used with the reflex mirrors locked up. On large format view cameras and rangefinder cameras, short-focus lenses are widely used because they give less distortion than the retrofocus design and there is no need for a long back focal distance.

The retrofocus lens solves this proximity problem through an asymmetrical design that allows the rear element to be farther away from the film plane than its effective focal length would suggest. (See Angénieux retrofocus.)

For example, it is not uncommon for the rear element of a retrofocus lens of 18 mm to be more than 25 mm from the film plane. This makes it possible to design wide-angle lenses for single-lens reflex cameras.

The axial adjustment range for focusing Ultra wide angle lenses and some Wide-angle lenses in large format cameras is usually very small.
Some manufacturers (e.g. Linhof) have offered special focusing lens mounts, so-called &#x27;wide-angle focusing devices&#x27; for their cameras that allow the lens to be focused precisely without moving the entire front standard.

==Development==
The first wide angle lens was developed in the 1850s by photographer Thomas Sutton. It involved a water filled lens creating panoramic visuals without the use of a rotating body.

<text>A telephoto lens, also known as telelens, is a specific type of a long-focus lens used in photography and cinematography, in which the physical length of the lens is shorter than the focal length. This is achieved by incorporating a special lens group known as a &quot;telephoto group&quot; that extends the light path to create a long-focus lens in a much shorter overall design. The angle of view and other effects of long-focus lenses are the same for telephoto lenses of the same specified focal length. Long-focal-length lenses are often informally referred to as &quot;telephoto lenses&quot;, although this is technically incorrect: a telephoto lens specifically incorporates the telephoto group.

==Construction==

A simple photographic lens may be constructed using one lens element of a given focal length; to focus on an object at infinity, the distance from this single lens to focal plane of the camera (where the sensor or film is) has to be adjusted to the focal length of that lens. For example, given a focal length of 500 mm, the distance between lens and focal plane is 500 mm. The farther the focal length is increased, the more the physical length of such a simple lens makes it unwieldy. In practice, to minimize optical aberrations, instead of a single lens element, these simple lenses usually are constructed using several elements to form an achromatic lens.

But such simple lenses are not telephoto lenses, no matter how extreme the focal length – they are known as &quot;long-focus lenses&quot;. While the optical centre of a simple (&quot;non-telephoto&quot;) lens is within the construction, the telephoto lens moves the optical centre in front of the construction. In other words, a telephoto lens might have a focal length of 400 mm, while it is shorter than that. While the length of a long-focus lens approximates its focal length, a telephoto lens manages to be shorter than its focal length. The term &quot;telephoto ratio&quot; refers to the physical length of a lens divided by its focal length; where long-focus lenses have a telephoto ratio around 1, telephoto lenses have a ratio less than 1. As an example, one modern lens (Canon EF 400 mm DO IS) achieves a telephoto ratio of in part due to a front (converging) lens group which incorporates diffractive optics.
The simplest telephoto lens can be regarded as having two elements: one (on the object side) converging and another (on the image side) diverging. Again, in practice, more than one element is used in each group to correct for various aberrations. The combination of these two groups produces a lens assembly that is physically shorter than a long-focus lens producing the same image size.

As a group, the front (object-facing) elements in a telephoto lens collectively have a positive focus, with an overall focal length that is shorter than the effective focal length of the lens. The converging rays from this group are intercepted by the rear (image-facing) lens group, sometimes called the &quot;telephoto group,&quot; which has a negative focus. This second group of elements spread the cone of light so that it appears to have come from a lens of much greater focal length.
This same property is achieved in camera lenses that combine mirrors with lenses. These designs, called catadioptric, &#x27;reflex&#x27;, or &#x27;mirror&#x27; lenses, have a curved mirror as the primary objective with some form of negative lens in front of the mirror to correct optical aberrations. They also use a curved secondary mirror to relay the image that extends the light cone the same way the negative lens telephoto group does. The mirrors also fold the light path. This makes them much shorter, lighter, and cheaper than an all refractive lens, but some optical compromises, primarily the &quot;doughnut&quot; shape of out-of-focus highlights, are caused by the central obstruction from the secondary mirror.

The heaviest non-Catadioptric telephoto lens for civilian use was made by Carl Zeiss and has a focal length of 1700 mm with a maximum aperture of , implying a entrance pupil. It is designed for use with a medium format Hasselblad 203 FE camera and weighs .

The telephoto lens design has also been used for wide angles; in the case of the Olympus XA, the telephoto arrangement permitted a 35 mm focal length to fit in an extra compact camera body.

===Retrofocus lenses===

Inverting the telephoto configuration, employing one or more negative lens groups in front of a positive lens group, creates a wide-angle lens with an increased back focal distance. These are called retrofocus lenses or inverted telephotos, which have greater clearance from the rear element to the film plane than their focal length would permit with a conventional wide-angle lens optical design. This allows for greater clearance for other optical or mechanical parts such as the mirror parts in a single-lens reflex camera.

Zoom lenses that are telephotos at one extreme of the zoom range and retrofocus at the other are now common.

==Naming==

Telephoto lenses are sometimes divided into the further sub-types of short or portrait (85–135 mm in 35 mm film format), medium (135–300 mm in 35 mm film format) and super (over 300 mm in 35 mm film format).
==History==


The concept of the telephoto lens, in reflecting form, was first described by Johannes Kepler in his &quot;Dioptrice&quot; of 1611, and re-invented by Peter Barlow in 1834.

Histories of photography usually credit Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer with the invention of the photographic telephoto lens in 1891, though it was independently invented by others about the same time; some credit his father John Henry Dallmeyer in 1860.

In 1883 or 1884, New Zealand photographer Alexander McKay discovered he could create a much more manageable long-focus lens by combining a shorter focal length telescope objective lens with negative lenses and other optical parts from opera glasses to modify the light cone. Some of his photographs are preserved in the holdings of the Turnbull Library in Wellington, and two of these can be unequivocally dated as having been taken during May 1886. One of McKay&#x27;s photographs shows a warship anchored in Wellington harbour about two and a half kilometres away, with its rigging lines and gun ports clearly visible. The other, taken from the same point, is of a local hotel, the Shepherds Arms, about 100 metres distant from the camera. The masts of the ship are visible in the background. McKay&#x27;s other photographic achievements include photo-micrographs, and a ‘shadow-less technique’ for photographing fossils.

McKay presented his work to the Wellington Philosophical Society (the precursor of the Royal Society of New Zealand) in 1890.

Starting in the mid-1970s, Japanese manufacturers introduced telephoto lenses which focused by moving the smaller (diverging) rear group, rather than moving the entire optical system as a unit; in some cases, a second converging group was added behind the diverging group. This was marketed as internal focusing, differential focusing, or rear focusing and the concept was derived from zoom lens designs.

<text>The Little House on the Prairie books comprise a series of American children&#x27;s novels written by Laura Ingalls Wilder (b. Laura Elizabeth Ingalls). The stories are based on her childhood and adulthood in the American Midwest (Wisconsin, Kansas, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Missouri) between 1872-94. Eight of the novels were completed by Wilder, and published by Harper &amp; Brothers in the 1930s and 1940s, during her lifetime. The name &quot;Little House&quot; appears in the first and third novels in the series, while the third is identically titled &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;. The second novel, meanwhile, was about her husband&#x27;s childhood.

The first draft of a ninth novel was published posthumously in 1971 and is commonly included in the series. A tenth book, the non-fiction &quot;On the Way Home&quot;, is Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s diary of the years after 1894, when she, her husband and their daughter moved from DeSmet, South Dakota to Mansfield, Missouri, where they settled permanently. It was also published posthumously, in 1962, and includes commentary by her daughter, Rose Wilder Lane.

The &quot;Little House&quot; books have been adapted for stage or screen more than once, most successfully as the American television series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, which ran from 1974 to 1983. As well as an anime (&quot;Laura, the Prairie Girl&quot;) and many spin-off books, there are cookbooks and various other licensed products representative of the books.

==History==

===Publishing===
The first book of the &quot;Little House&quot; series, &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot;, was published in 1932. This first book did well when it was first published. The &quot;Little House&quot; books were reissued by Ursula Nordstrom to be illustrated by Garth Williams.

Before writing the &quot;Little House&quot; series, Laura Ingalls Wilder was a columnist in a farm journal. Her daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, was the motivator behind Wilder&#x27;s writing and publishing of the first book. Since the first book, there have been around 60 million &quot;Little House&quot; books sold. Nine books fall under the &quot;Little House&quot; books umbrella.

Rose Wilder Lane had a heavy hand in the editing of the books, though Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s voice is still strong. Lane&#x27;s level of influence is disputed, but views that align with hers are very visible within the books. Regardless, Rose Wilder Lane was a large part in the publishing and form of the books. Lane also had a hand in giving the rights to Roger Lea MacBride, who then led to the creation of the television show entitled &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; ranks the &quot;Little House&quot; series as 22 out of 100 of the &quot;100 Best Young Adult Books of All Time.&quot; They are considered classics of American children&#x27;s literature and remain widely read. In a 2012 survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience, &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; was ranked number 19 among all-time best children&#x27;s novels, and two of its sequels were ranked among the top 100. Five of the &quot;Little House&quot; book have been Honor Books for the Newbery Medal. In 1938, &quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek&quot; was an Honor Book; in 1940, &quot;By the Shores of Silver Lake&quot; was as well. Later in 1941, &quot;The Long Winter&quot; became an Honor Book, and the two later Honor Books were &quot;The Little Town on the Prairie&quot;, in 1942, and &quot;Those Happy Golden Years&quot;, in 1944. In addition to this, the American Library Association stated that &quot;The Long Winter&quot;, the seventh book in the series, was a &quot;resource for teaching about pioneer history.&quot;

===Depiction of minorities===
The &quot;Little House&quot; books include depictions of ethnic minorities, including a heroic black doctor who saves the protagonist&#x27;s family. Certain criticisms of the &quot;Little House&quot; books, however, have noted its portrayals of Native Americans. These criticisms highlight negative depictions of Native Americans present in the books, as well as obliviousness, on the part of the books&#x27; characters, of their occupation of the Native Americans&#x27; land.

An incident related to Wilder&#x27;s depiction of Native Americans occurred in 1998, when an eight-year-old girl was read &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; in her elementary school class. In the book, a minor character says, &quot;The only good Indian is a dead Indian.&quot; To this, Pa responds, &quot;he didn&#x27;t know about that. He figured that Indians would be as peaceable as anybody else if they were let alone.&quot; The girl came home crying; her mother, Angela Cavender Wilson, a member of the Wahpetunwan Dakota nation and a scholar of Native American history, challenged the school&#x27;s use of the book in its classroom. This event, among others, prompted the American Library Association to investigate and ultimately change the name of the Wilder Award to the Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award. This award is given to books that have made a large impact on children&#x27;s literature in America.

===Accuracy to history===
Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s work is autobiographical fiction and Wilder employed artistic licence, including creating composite characters based on multiple real individuals and presenting a subjective view of her family&#x27;s experiences. It has been criticized regarding the history of the government&#x27;s involvement in homesteading, and its effect upon Native American people, including her family&#x27;s illegal occupation of land which was still recognized by the United States government as the Osage Nation&#x27;s territory.

====Connections with politics====
While Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote the &quot;Little House&quot; books, it was Rose Wilder Lane who edited them and it was Lane who had the rights after Wilder&#x27;s death. According to the New York Times Rose was an &quot;outspoken antigovernment polemicist and is called one of the grandmothers of the libertarian movement.&quot; Lane&#x27;s views were supported by her mother. Despite her mother&#x27;s support of her political views, Lane went against her mother and what was written in her will by leaving the rights of the &quot;Little House&quot; books to Roger Lea MacBride after her own death. Roger Lea MacBride has strong connections to politics, being a once libertarian presidential candidate, and a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus. He gained the rights to the books not only from Lane&#x27;s will but also through a legal battle with the library that Wilder wrote in her will should gain the rights after Lane&#x27;s death. It was MacBride who allowed the television show to be made and who talked about Laura&#x27;s books, and through the rights he made a great deal of money.

====Depiction of the United States Government====
Anti-governmental political views, such as those held by Rose Wilder Lane, have been attributed to the &quot;Little House&quot; books. In her article, &quot;&quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and the Truth About the American West&quot;, historian Patricia Nelson Limerick connects Wilder&#x27;s apparent and Lane&#x27;s outright distaste for the government as a way to blame the government for their father&#x27;s failure at homesteading. In &quot;&quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and the Myth of Self Reliance&quot;, Julie Tharp and Jeff Kleiman say that the idea of the settlers&#x27; self-reliance, which they consider to be a myth, has contributed to conservative rhetoric, and that the &quot;Little House&quot; books are full of this myth.

Four series of books expand the &quot;Little House&quot; series to include five generations of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s family. The &quot;Martha Years&quot; and &quot;Charlotte Years&quot; series, by Melissa Wiley, are fictionalized tales of Laura&#x27;s great-grandmother in Scotland in the late 18th century and grandmother in early 19th century Massachusetts. The &quot;Caroline Years&quot; series narrates Wilder&#x27;s mother, Caroline Quiner&#x27;s, childhood in Wisconsin. The Rose Years (originally known as the &quot;Rocky Ridge Years&quot;) series follows Rose Wilder Lane from childhood in Missouri to early adulthood in San Francisco. It was written by her surrogate grandson Roger MacBride.

Two volumes of Wilder&#x27;s letters and diaries have also been issued under the &quot;Little House&quot; imprint: &quot;On The Way Home&quot; and &quot;West From Home&quot;, published by HarperCollins in 1962 and 1974 respectively.

===&quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot;===

Little House in the Big Woods was published in 1932. Written by Laura Ingalls Wilder, the book is autobiographical, though some parts of the story were embellished or changed to appeal more to an audience, such as Laura&#x27;s age. In the book, Laura herself turns five years old, when the real-life author had only been three during the events of the book. According to a letter from her daughter, Rose, to biographer William Anderson, the publisher had Laura change her age in the book because it seemed unrealistic for a three-year-old to have specific memories such as she wrote about. The story of &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot;, revolves around the life of the Ingalls family. The family includes mother Caroline Ingalls, father Charles Ingalls, elder daughter Mary Amelia Ingalls, and younger daughter (and protagonist) Laura Ingalls Wilder. Also in the story, though not yet born historically, is Laura&#x27;s baby sister Carrie.

The setting of this book is different from the rest of the series, as the story takes place in the Ingalls&#x27; small cabin in the state of Wisconsin, near a town called Pepin&quot;. Little House in the Big Woods&quot; describes the homesteading skills Laura observed and began to practice during her fifth year. The cousins come for Christmas that year, and Laura receives a doll, which she names Charlotte. Later that winter, the family goes to Grandma Ingalls’s home and has a “sugaring off,” when they harvest sap and make maple syrup. They return home with buckets of syrup, enough to last the year. Laura remembered that sugaring off and the dance that followed for the rest of her life.

The book also describes other farm work duties and events, such as the birth of a calf; the availability of milk, butter and cheese; gardening; field work; hunting; gathering; and more. Everyday housework is also described in detail. When Pa went into the woods to hunt, he usually came home with a deer and then smoked the meat for the coming winter. One day he noticed a bee tree and returned from hunting early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the honey. When Pa returned home on winter evenings, Laura and Mary always begged him to play his fiddle, but he was too tired from farm work to play during the summertime. Later in the series, the family moved away from Wisconsin to a homestead in Kansas, as territory in the West was being given to settlers. Later they moved on to Minnesota. This reflects the time period in the 1800s during which farmers and many others were migrating westward into the American frontier.

===&quot;Farmer Boy&quot;===
&quot;Farmer Boy&quot; was published in 1933. It is the second Little House book, although its story is unrelated to the first few books in the series. It features Laura&#x27;s future husband, Almanzo Wilder. In &quot;Farmer Boy&quot;, Almanzo is featured from before his ninth birthday until after his tenth. Throughout the novel, Laura recounts the experiences and adventures of Almanzo in his late childhood and adolescence. Living in a successful farm in the state of New York in the late 19th century, Almanzo endures hardships such as the long walk to school with his older siblings. Through &quot;Farmer Boy&quot;, readers catch a glimpse of the daily routine of early farmers, and learn about activities such as candle making, shearing sheep, threshing wheat, and even making donuts. The story also walks readers through Almanzo&#x27;s favorite pastimes, which include sledding, berry picking, swimming, and fishing. 

===&quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;===
&quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, published in 1935, is the third book in the Little House series but only the second that features the Ingalls family; it continues directly the story of the inaugural novel, &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot;.

The book tells about the months the Ingalls family spent on the prairie of Kansas, around the town of Independence, Kansas. At the beginning of this story, Pa Ingalls decides to sell the house in the Big Woods of Wisconsin and move the family, via covered wagon, to the Indian Territory near Independence, Kansas, as there were widely circulating stories that the land (under Osage ownership) would be opened to settlement by homesteaders imminently. So Laura, along with Pa and Ma, Mary, and baby Carrie, move to Kansas. Along the way, Pa trades his two horses for two Western mustangs, which Laura and Mary name Pet and Patty.

When the family reaches Indian Territory, they meet Mr. Edwards, who is extremely polite to Ma but tells Laura and Mary that he is &quot;a wildcat from Tennessee.&quot; Mr. Edwards is an excellent neighbor, who helps the Ingalls in every way he can, beginning with helping Pa erect their house. Pa builds a roof and a floor for their house and digs a well, and the family is finally settled.

At their new home, unlike their time in the Big Woods, the family meets difficulty and danger. The Ingalls family becomes terribly ill from a disease called at that time &quot;fever &#x27;n&#x27; ague&quot; (fever with severe chills and shaking), which was later identified as malaria. Laura comments on the varied ways they believe to have acquired it, with &quot;Ma&quot; believing it came from eating bad watermelon. Mrs. Scott, another neighbor, takes care of the family while they are sick. Around this time, Mr. Edwards brings Laura and Mary their Christmas presents from Independence, and in the spring the Ingallses plant the beginnings of a small farm.

Ma&#x27;s fears about American Indians and Laura&#x27;s observations at the time are contrasted with Pa&#x27;s liberal view of them, and all these views are shown side by side with the older Laura&#x27;s objective portrayal of the Osage tribe that lived on that land.

At the end of this book, the family is told that the land must be vacated by settlers as it is not legally open to settlement yet, and in 1870 Pa elects to leave the land and move before the Army forcibly requires him to abandon the land.

===&quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek&quot;===
&quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek&quot;, published in 1937 and fourth in the series, follows the Ingalls family as they move from Pepin, Wisconsin to Kansas to an area near Walnut Grove, Minnesota, and settle in a dugout &quot;on the banks of Plum Creek (Redwood County, Minnesota)&quot;.

Pa trades his horses Pet and Patty to the property owner (a man named Hanson) for the land and crops, but later he gets two new horses, Sam and David, called the “Christmas horses&quot;. Pa soon builds a new, above-ground, wooden house for the family, borrowing against the wheat crop he&#x27;s planted. During this story, Laura and Mary go to school in town for the first time, and they meet their teacher, Miss Eva Beadle. They also meet Nellie Oleson, who makes fun of Laura and Mary for being &quot;country girls&quot;. Laura plays with her bulldog Jack when she is home, and she and Mary are invited to a party at the Olesons&#x27; home. Laura and Mary invite all the girls (including Nellie) to a party at their house to reciprocate. A church is founded in town, led by Reverend Alden, and the family attends a Christmas service where the children see their first Christmas tree. The family soon goes through hard times when a plague of Rocky Mountain locusts decimates their crops. Pa must leave to work the harvest farther east. The book ends with Pa returning safely to the house after being unaccounted for during a severe four-day blizzard.

===&quot;By the Shores of Silver Lake&quot;===
&quot;By the Shores of Silver Lake&quot; was published in 1939 and is fifth in the series.

The story begins when the family is about to leave Plum Creek shortly after the family has recovered from the scarlet fever which caused Mary to become blind. The family welcomes a visit from Aunt Docia, whom they had not seen for several years. She suggests that Pa and Ma move west to the rapidly developing Dakota Territory, where Pa could work in Uncle Henry&#x27;s railroad camp at very good wages for that era. Ma and Pa agree, since it will allow Pa to look for a homestead while he works. The family has endured many hardships at Plum Creek, and Pa especially is anxious for a new start. After selling his land and farm to neighbors, Pa goes ahead with the wagon and team. Mary is still too weak to travel, so the rest of the family follows later by train.

The day Pa leaves, however, their beloved bulldog Jack is found dead, which saddens Laura greatly. In actuality, the dog upon whom Jack was based was no longer with the family at this point, but the author inserted his death here to serve as a transition between her childhood and her adolescence. Laura also begins to play a more mature role in the family due to Mary&#x27;s blindness. Pa instructs Laura to &quot;be Mary&#x27;s eyes&quot; and to assist her in daily life as she learns to cope with her disability. Mary is strong and willing to learn.

The family travels to Dakota Territory by train. This is the children&#x27;s first train trip and they are excited by the novelty of this new mode of transportation that allows them to travel in one hour the distance it would take a horse and wagon an entire day to cover.

With the family reunited and situated at the railroad camp, Laura meets her cousin Lena, and the two become good friends.

As winter approaches and the railroad workers take down the cabins and head back east, the family wonders where they might stay for the winter. As luck would have it, the county surveyor needs a house-sitter while he is back east for the winter, and Pa signs up. It is a winter of luxury for the Ingalls family as they are given all the provisions they need in the large, comfortable house. They spend a cozy winter with their new friends, Mr. and Mrs. Boast, and both families look forward to starting their new claims in the spring.

But the &quot;spring rush&quot; comes early. The large mobilization of pioneers to the Dakotas in early March prompts Pa to leave immediately on the few days&#x27; trip to the claims office. The girls are left alone to spend their days and nights boarding and feeding all the pioneers passing through. They charge 25 cents for dinner and boarding and start a savings account toward sending Mary to the School for the Blind in Vinton, Iowa.

Pa successfully files his claim, with the aid of old friend Mr. Edwards. As the spring flowers bloom and the prairie comes alive with new settlers, the Ingalls family moves to their new piece of land and begins building what will become their permanent home.

===&quot;The Long Winter&quot;===
&quot;The Long Winter&quot;, published in 1940 and sixth in the series, covers the shortest time span of the novels, only an eight-month period. The winter of 1880–1881 was a notably severe winter in history, sometimes known as &quot;The Snow Winter.&quot;

The story begins in Dakota Territory at the Ingalls homestead in South Dakota on a hot September day in 1880 as Laura and her father (&quot;Pa&quot;) are haying. Pa tells Laura that he knows the winter is going to be hard because muskrats always build a house with thick walls before a hard winter, and this year they have built the thickest walls he has ever seen. In mid October the Ingallses wake with an unusually early blizzard howling around their poorly insulated claim shanty. Soon afterward, Pa receives another warning from an unexpected source: a dignified old Native American man comes to the general store in town to warn the white settlers that there will be seven months of blizzards. Impressed, Pa decides to move the family into town for the winter.

Laura attends school with her younger sister Carrie until the weather becomes too severe to permit them to walk to and from the school building. Blizzard after blizzard sweeps through the town over the next few months. Food and fuel become scarce and expensive, as the town depends on the trains to bring supplies but the frequent blizzards prevent the trains from getting through. Eventually, the railroad company suspends all efforts to dig out the train, stranding the town. For weeks, the Ingallses subsist on potatoes and coarse brown bread, using twisted hay for fuel. As even this meager food runs out, Laura&#x27;s future husband Almanzo Wilder and his friend Cap Garland risk their lives to bring wheat to the starving townspeople – enough to last the rest of the winter.

Laura&#x27;s age in this book is accurate. (In 1880, she would have been 13, as she states in the first chapter.) However, Almanzo Wilder&#x27;s age is misrepresented in this book. Much is made of the fact that he is 19 pretending to be 21 in order to illegally obtain a homestead claim from the US government. But in 1880, his true age would have been 23. Scholar Ann Romines has suggested that Laura made Almanzo younger because it was felt that more modern audiences would be scandalized by the great difference in their ages in light of their young marriage.

As predicted, the blizzards continue for seven months. Finally, the trains begin running again, bringing the Ingallses a Christmas barrel full of good things, including a turkey. In the last chapter, they sit down to enjoy their Christmas dinner in May.

===&quot;Little Town on the Prairie&quot;===
&quot;Little Town on the Prairie&quot;, published in 1941 is seventh in the series.

The story begins as Laura accepts her first job performing sewing work in order to earn money for Mary to go to a college for the blind in Iowa. Laura&#x27;s hard work comes to an end by summer when she is let go, and the family begins planning to raise cash crops to pay for Mary&#x27;s college. After the crops are destroyed by blackbirds, Pa sells a calf to earn the balance of the money needed. When Ma and Pa escort Mary to the college, Laura, Carrie, and Grace are left alone for a week. In order to stave off the loneliness stemming from Mary&#x27;s departure, Laura, Carrie, and Grace do the fall cleaning. They have several problems, but the house is sparkling when they are done. Ma and Pa come home, and are truly surprised.

In the fall, the Ingallses quickly prepare for a move to town for the winter. Laura and Carrie attend school in town, and Laura is reunited with her friends Minnie Johnson and Mary Power, and she meets a new girl, Ida Brown. There is a new schoolteacher for the winter term: Eliza Jane Wilder, Almanzo&#x27;s sister. Nellie Oleson, Laura&#x27;s nemesis from Plum Creek, has moved to De Smet and is attending the school. Nellie turns the teacher against Laura, and Miss Wilder loses control of the school for a time. A visit by the school board restores order; however, Miss Wilder leaves at the end of the fall term, and she is eventually replaced by Mr. Clewett and then by Mr. Owen, the latter of whom befriends Laura. Through the course of the winter, Laura sets herself to studying, as she only has one year left before she can apply for a teaching certificate.

At the same time, Almanzo Wilder begins escorting Laura home from school. By Christmas, Almanzo has offered to take Laura on a sleigh ride after he completes the cutter he is building.

At home, Laura is met by Mr. Boast and Mr. Brewster, who ask Laura if she would be interested in a teaching position at a settlement led by Brewster, from town. The school superintendent, George Williams, comes and tests Laura. Though she is two months too young, he never asks her age. She is awarded a third-grade teaching certificate.

===&quot;These Happy Golden Years&quot;===
&quot;These Happy Golden Years&quot;, published in 1943 and eighth in the series, originally ended with a note alone on the last page: &quot;The end of the Little house books.&quot; It takes place between 1882 and 1885. As the story begins, Pa is taking Laura from home to her first teaching assignment at the Brewster settlement. Laura, only 15 and a schoolgirl herself, is apprehensive, as this is both the first time she has left home and the first school at which she has taught. She is determined to complete her assignment and earn $40 to help her sister Mary, who is attending Vinton College for the Blind in Iowa.

This first assignment proves difficult for her. Laura must board with the Brewsters in their two-room claim shanty, sleeping on their sofa. The Brewsters are an unhappy family, and Laura is deeply uncomfortable observing husband and wife quarrel. In one particularly unsettling incident, she wakes in the night to see Mrs. Brewster standing over her husband with a knife. It is a bitterly cold winter, and neither the claim shanty nor the school house can be heated adequately. The children she is teaching, some of whom are older than she is herself, test her skills as a teacher. Laura grows more self-assured, and she successfully completes the two-month term.

To Laura&#x27;s surprise and delight, homesteader Almanzo Wilder (with whom she became acquainted in &quot;Little Town on the Prairie&quot;) appears at the end of her first week of school in his new two-horse cutter to bring her home for the weekend. Already fond of Laura and wanting to ease her homesickness, Almanzo takes it upon himself to bring her home and back to school each weekend.

The relationship continues after the school term ends. Sleigh rides give way to buggy rides in the spring, and Laura impresses Almanzo with her willingness to help break his new and often temperamental horses. Laura&#x27;s old nemesis, Nellie Oleson, makes a brief appearance during two Sunday buggy rides with Almanzo. Nellie&#x27;s chatter and flirtatious behavior towards Almanzo annoy Laura. She finally tells Almanzo to choose between them. Shortly thereafter, Nellie moves back to New York after her family loses its homestead.

Laura&#x27;s Uncle Tom (Ma&#x27;s brother) visits the family and tells of his failed venture with a covered-wagon brigade seeking gold in the Black Hills. Laura helps out seamstress Mrs. McKee by staying with her and her daughter on their prairie claim for two months to &quot;hold it down&quot; as required by law. The family enjoys summer visits from Mary.

The family finances have improved to the point that Pa can sell a cow to purchase a sewing machine for Ma. Laura continues to teach and work as a seamstress.

Almanzo invites Laura to attend summer &quot;singing school&quot; with him and her classmates. On the last evening of singing school, while driving Laura home, Almanzo, after courting Laura for three years, proposes to her. During their next ride, Almanzo presents Laura with a garnet-and-pearl ring and they share their first kiss.

Several months later, after Almanzo has finished building a house on his tree claim, he asks Laura if she would mind getting married within a few days, as his sister and his mother have their hearts set on a large church wedding, which Pa cannot afford. Laura agrees, and she and Almanzo are married in a simple ceremony by the Reverend Brown. After a wedding dinner with her family, Laura drives away with Almanzo, and the newlyweds settle contentedly into their new home.

===&quot;The First Four Years&quot;===
&quot;The First Four Years&quot;, published in 1971, is commonly considered the ninth and last book in the original Little House series. It covers the earliest years of Laura and Almanzo&#x27;s marriage. The style is less polished than the other books because it was discovered among Laura&#x27;s papers after her death and published unedited.

&quot;The First Four Years&quot; derives its title from a promise Laura made to Almanzo when they became engaged. Laura did not want to be a farm wife, but she consented to try farming for three years. Their daughter Rose is born, then a son who dies at a few weeks old. Wheat crops fail, and Almanzo becomes partially paralyzed as a result of diphtheria. At the end of that time, Laura and Almanzo mutually agree to continue for one more year, a &quot;year of grace&quot;, in Laura&#x27;s words. That summer a fire destroys their house. The book ends at the close of that fourth year, on a rather optimistic note. Laura compares a farmer&#x27;s hope for success year to year to her father&#x27;s lifelong hope for a better life farther west. In reality, the continually hot, dry Dakota summers, and overwhelming debt eventually drove them from their land, but they later founded a very successful fruit and dairy farm in Missouri, where they lived comfortably until their respective deaths.

The show was a loose adaptation of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s Little House on the Prairie semi-autobiographical novel series, although the namesake book was represented in the premiere only; the ensuing television episodes primarily followed characters and locations from the follow-up book, &quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek&quot; (1937), although the continuity of the television series greatly departed from this book as well. Some storylines were borrowed from Wilder&#x27;s later books but were portrayed as having taken place in the &quot;Plum Creek&quot; setting. Michael Landon starred as Charles Ingalls, Karen Grassle played Caroline Ingalls, Melissa Gilbert played Laura Ingalls, Melissa Sue Anderson played Mary Ingalls, and the twins Lindsay and Sidney Greenbush (credited as Lindsay Sidney Greenbush) played Carrie Ingalls. Victor French portrayed long-time friend Mr. Edwards. Dean Butler portrayed Laura&#x27;s husband, Almanzo Wilder. Some characters were added in the show, such as Albert, played by Matthew Laborteaux, an orphan whom the family adopted.

Although it deviated from the original books in many respects, the television series, which was set in Walnut Grove, Minnesota, was one of a few long-running successful dramatic family shows. It remained a top-rated series, and garnered 17 Emmy and three Golden Globe nominations, along with two People&#x27;s Choice Awards.

<text>A corporate identity or corporate image is the manner in which a corporation, firm or business enterprise presents itself to the public. The corporate identity is typically visualized by branding and with the use of trademarks, but it can also include things like product design, advertising, public relations etc. Corporate identity is a primary goal of corporate communication, aiming to build and maintain company identity.

In general, this amounts to a corporate title, logo (logotype and/or logogram) and supporting devices commonly assembled within a set of corporate guidelines. These guidelines govern how the identity is applied and usually include approved color palettes, typefaces, page layouts, fonts, and others.

==Integrated marketing communications (IMC)==

Corporate identity is the set of multi-sensory elements that marketers employ to communicate a visual statement about the brand to consumers. These multi-sensory elements include but are not limited to company name, logo, slogan, buildings, décor, uniforms, company colors and in some cases, even the physical appearance of customer-facing employees. Corporate Identity is either weak or strong; to understand this concept, it is beneficial to consider exactly what constitutes a strong corporate identity.

Consonance, in the context of marketing, is a unified message offered to consumers from all fronts of the organization (Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). In the context of corporate identity, consonance is the alignment of all touch points. For example, Apple has strong brand consonance because at every point at which the consumer interacts with the brand, a consistent message is conveyed. This is seen in Apple TV advertisements, the Apple Store design, the physical presentation of customer facing Apple employees and the actual products, such as the iPhone, iPad and MacBook laptops. Every Apple touch point is communicating a unified message: From the advertising of the brand to the product packaging, the message sent to consumers is &#x27;we are simple, sophisticated, fun and user friendly&#x27;. Brand consonance solidifies corporate identity and encourages brand acceptance, on the grounds that when a consumer is exposed to a consistent message multiple times across the entirety of a brand, the message is easier to trust and the existence of the brand is easier to accept. Strong brand consonance is imperative to achieving strong corporate identity.

Strong consonance, and in turn, strong corporate identity can be achieved through the implementation and integration of integrated marketing communications (IMC). IMC is a collective of concepts and communications processes that seek to establish clarity and consistency in the positioning of a brand in the mind of consumers. As espoused by Holm (cited in Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011), at its ultimate stage, IMC is implemented at a corporate level and consolidates all aspects of the organization; this initiates brand consonance which in turn inspires strong corporate identity. To appreciate this idea with heavier mental weight, it is important to regard the different levels of IMC integration.

The communication-based model, advanced by Duncan and Moriarty (as cited in Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011) contends that there are three levels of IMC integration; Duncan and Moriarty affirm that the lowest level of IMC integration is level one where IMC decisions are made by marketing communication level message sources. These sources include personal sales, advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing, public relations, packaging and events departments. The stake holders concerned at this stage are consumers, local communities, media and interest groups (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). At the second stage of IMC integration, Duncan and Moriarty (as cited in Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011) establish that level one integration departments still have decision-making power but are now guided by marketing level message sources. At stage two integration the message sources are those departments in which product mix, price mix, marketing communication and distribution mix are settled; appropriately, stakeholders at this stage of integration are distributors, suppliers and competition (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). It is at this stage of integration that consumers interact with the organization (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). Moving forward, the last stage of Duncan and Moriarty&#x27;s Communication Based Model (as cited in Laurie and Mortimer, 2011) is stage three where message sources are at the corporate level of the organization; these message sources include administration, manufacturing operations, marketing, finance, human resources and legal departments. The stakeholders at this level of IMC integration are employees, investors, financial community, government and regulators (Duncan and Moriarty, 1998 as cited in Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). At the final stages of IMC integration, IMC decisions are made not only by corporate level departments but also by departments classified in stages one and two. It is the inclusion of all organizational departments by which a horizontal, non linear method of communication with consumers is achieved. By unifying all fronts of the marketing firm, communications are synchronized to achieve consistency, consonance and ultimately strong corporate identity.

==Organizational point of view==
In a recent monograph on Chinese corporate identity (Routledge, 2006), Peter Peverelli, proposes a new definition of corporate identity, based on the general organization theory proposed in his earlier work, in particular Peverelli (2000). This definition regards identity as a result of social interaction:
* Corporate identity is the way corporate actors (actors who perceive themselves as acting on behalf of the company) make sense of their company in ongoing social interaction with other actors in a specific context. It includes shared perceptions of reality, ways-to-do-things, etc., and interlocked behavior.
* In this process, the corporate actors are of equal importance as those others; corporate identity pertains to the company (the group of corporate actors) as well as to the relevant others;

===Best practices===
The following four key brand requirements are critical for a successful corporate identity strategy.

*Differentiation. In today&#x27;s highly competitive market, brands need to have a clear differentiation or reason for being. What they represent needs to stand apart from others in order to be noticed, make an impression, and to ultimately be preferred.
*Relevance. Brands need to connect to what people care about in the world. To build demand, they need to understand and fulfill the needs and aspirations of their intended audiences.
*Coherence. To assure credibility with their audiences, brands must be coherent in what they say and do. All the messages, all the marketing communication, all the brand experiences, and all of the product delivery need to hang together and add up to something meaningful.
*Esteem. A brand that is differentiated, relevant and coherent is one that is valued by both its internal and external audiences. Esteem is the reputation a brand has earned by executing clearly on both its promised and delivered experience.

==Visual identity==
Corporate visual identity plays a significant role in the way an organization presents itself to both internal and external stakeholders. In general terms, a corporate visual identity expresses the values and ambitions of an organization, its business, and its characteristics. Four functions of corporate visual identity can be distinguished. Three of these are aimed at external stakeholders.

# First, a corporate visual identity provides an organization with visibility and &quot;recognizability&quot;. For virtually all profit and non-profit organizations, it is of vital importance that people know that the organization exists and remember its name and core business at the right time.
# Second, a corporate visual identity symbolizes an organization for external stakeholders, and, hence, contributes to its image and reputation (Schultz, Hatch and Larsen, 2000). Van den Bosch, De Jong and Elving (2005) explored possible relationships between corporate visual identity and reputation, and concluded that corporate visual identity plays a supportive role in corporate reputation.
# Third, a corporate visual identity expresses the structure of an organization to its external stakeholders, visualizing its coherence as well as the relationships between divisions or units. Olins (1989) is well known for his &quot;corporate identity structure&quot;, which consists of three concepts: monolithic brands for companies which have a single brand, identity in which different brands are developed for parts of the organization or for different product lines, and an endorsed identity with different brands which are (visually) connected to each other. Although these concepts introduced by Olins are often presented as the corporate identity structure, they merely provide an indication of the visual presentation of (parts of) the organization. It is therefore better to describe it as a &quot;corporate visual identity structure&quot;.
# A fourth, internal function of corporate visual identity relates to employees&#x27; identification with the organization as a whole and/or the specific departments they work for (depending on the corporate visual strategy in this respect). Identification appears to be crucial for employees, and corporate visual identity probably plays a symbolic role in creating such identification.

The definition of the corporate visual identity management is:

Special attention is paid to corporate identity in times of organizational change. Once a new corporate identity is implemented, attention to corporate identity related issues generally tends to decrease. However, corporate identity needs to be managed on a structural basis, to be internalized by the employees and to harmonize with future organizational developments.

Efforts to manage the corporate visual identity will result in more consistency and the corporate visual identity management mix should include structural, cultural and strategic aspects. Guidelines, procedures and tools can be summarized as the structural aspects of managing the corporate visual identity.

However, as important as the structural aspects may be, they must be complemented by two other types of aspects. Among the cultural aspects of corporate visual identity management, socialization – i.e., formal and informal learning processes – turned out to influence the consistency of a corporate visual identity. Managers are important as a role models and they can clearly set an example. This implies that they need to be aware of the impact of their behavior, which has an effect on how employees behave. If managers pay attention to the way they convey the identity of their organization, including the use of a corporate visual identity, this will have a positive effect on the attention employees give to the corporate visual identity.

Further, it seems to be important that the organization communicates the strategic aspects of the corporate visual identity. Employees need to have knowledge of the corporate visual identity of their organization – not only the general reasons for using the corporate visual identity, such as its role in enhancing the visibility and &quot;recognizability&quot; of the organization, but also aspects of the story behind the corporate visual identity. The story should explain why the design fits the organization and what the design – in all of its elements – is intended to express.

==Corporate colors==
Corporate colors (or company colors) are one of the most instantly recognizable elements of a corporate visual identity and promote a strong non-verbal message on the company&#x27;s behalf. Examples of corporate colors:
*Red for Coca-Cola and SMRT
* Blue for IBM, nicknamed &quot;Big Blue&quot;
* Brown for UPS, &quot;What can Brown do for you&quot;
* Blue for Korean Air
* Purple and Orange for SBS Transit

==Visual identity history==
Nearly 7,000 years ago, Transylvanian potters inscribed their personal marks on the earthenware they created. If one potter made better pots than another, naturally, his mark held more value than his competitors&#x27;. Religions created some of the most recognized identity marks: the Christian cross, the Judaic Star of David, and the Islamic crescent moon. In addition, Kings and nobles in medieval times had clothing, armor, flags, shields, tableware, entryways, and manuscript bindings that all bore coats of arms and royal seals. The symbols depicted a lord&#x27;s lineage, aspirations, familial virtues, as well as memoirs to cavalry, infantry, and mercenaries of who they were fighting for on the battlefields.

A trademark became a symbol of individuals&#x27; professional qualifications to perform a particular skill by the 15th century. For example, the Rod of Asclepius on a physician&#x27;s sign signified that the doctor was a well-trained practitioner of the medical arts. Simple graphics such as the caduceus carried so much socio-economic and political weight by the 16th century, that government offices were established throughout Europe to register and protect the growing collection of trademarks used by numerous craft guilds.

The concept of visually trademarking one&#x27;s business spread widely during the Industrial Revolution. The shift of business in favor of non-agricultural enterprise caused business, and corporate consciousness, to boom. Logo use became a mainstream part of identification, and over time, it held more power than being a simple identifier. Some logos held more value than others, and served more as assets than symbols.

Logos are now the visual identifiers of corporations. They became components of corporate identities by communicating brands and unifying messages. Logos commonly function as a solution to the challenge of distinguishing one brand from another. The evolution of symbols went from a way for a king to seal a letter, to how businesses establish their credibility and sell everything from financial services to hamburgers. Therefore, although the specific terms &quot;corporate image&quot; and &quot;[brand identity]&quot; didn&#x27;t enter business or design vocabulary until the 1940s, within twenty years they became key elements to business success.

==Media and corporate identity==

As technology and mass media have continued to develop at exponential rates, the role of the media in business increases as well. The media has a large effect on the formation of corporate identity by reinforcing a company&#x27;s image and reputation. Global television networks and the rise of business news have caused the public representation of organizations to critically influence the construction and deconstruction of certain organizational identities more than ever before.

Many companies pro-actively choose to create media attention and use it as a tool for identity construction and strengthening, and also to reinvent their images under the pressure of new technology. The media also has the power to produce and diffuse meanings a corporation holds, therefore giving stakeholders a negotiation of the organizational identity.

<text>Cinematography () is the art of motion picture (and more recently, electronic video camera) photography.

Cinematographers use a [[Cinematography|lens]] to focus reflected light from objects into a real image that is transferred to some image sensor or light-sensitive material inside the movie camera. These exposures are created sequentially and preserved for later processing and viewing as a motion picture. Capturing images with an electronic image sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel in the image, which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for subsequent processing or display. Images captured with photographic emulsion result in a series of invisible latent images on the film stock, which are chemically &quot;developed&quot; into a visible image. The images on the film stock are projected for viewing in the same motion picture.

Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business, as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.

== History ==

===Precursors===

In the 1830s, three different solutions for moving images were invented based on the concept of revolving drums and disks, the stroboscope by Simon von Stampfer in Austria, the phenakistoscope by Joseph Plateau in Belgium, and the zoetrope by William Horner in Britain.

In 1845, Francis Ronalds invented the first successful camera able to make continuous recordings of the varying indications of meteorological and geomagnetic instruments over time. The cameras were supplied to numerous observatories around the world and some remained in use until well into the 20th century.

William Lincoln patented a device, in 1867 that showed animated pictures called the &quot;wheel of life&quot; or &quot;zoopraxiscope&quot;. In it moving drawings or photographs were watched through a slit.

On 19 June 1878, Eadweard Muybridge successfully photographed a horse named &quot;Sallie Gardner&quot; in fast motion using a series of 24 stereoscopic cameras. The cameras were arranged along a track parallel to the horse&#x27;s, and each camera shutter was controlled by a trip wire triggered by the horse&#x27;s hooves. They were 21 inches apart to cover the 20 feet taken by the horse stride, taking pictures at one-thousandth of a second. At the end of the decade, Muybridge had adapted sequences of his photographs to a zoopraxiscope for short, primitive projected &quot;movies&quot;, which were sensations on his lecture tours by 1879 or 1880.

Four years later, in 1882, French scientist Étienne-Jules Marey invented a chronophotographic gun, which was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second and recording all the frames of the same picture.

The late nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries brought rise to the use of film not only for entertainment purposes but for scientific exploration as well. French biologist and filmmaker Jean Painleve lobbied heavily for the use of film in the scientific field, as the new medium was more efficient in capturing and documenting the behavior, movement, and environment of microorganisms, cells, and bacteria, than the naked eye. The introduction of film into scientific fields allowed for not only the viewing of &quot;new images and objects, such as cells and natural objects, but also the viewing of them in real time&quot;, whereas prior to the invention of moving pictures, scientists and doctors alike had to rely on hand-drawn sketches of human anatomy and its microorganisms. This posed a great inconvenience to the scientific and medical worlds. The development of film and increased usage of cameras allowed doctors and scientists to grasp a better understanding and knowledge of their projects.

The origins of today&#x27;s cinema go back to the Lumière brothers, Auguste and Louis, who in 1895 developed a machine called the Cinematographe, which had the ability to capture and show moving images. 
The early era of cinema saw rapid innovation. Filmmakers discover and apply new methods such as editing, special effects, close-ups, etc. Hollywood began to emerge as the mecca of the film industry, and many of the famous studios today such as Warner Bros and Paramount Pictures began to rule the film world.
Over time, cinema and cinematography have changed drastically. From the silent films of the early 20th century, to the ability of sound to be added to films in the 1920s, widescreen and color films in the 50s, huge improvements in general creativity and methodology have emerged.

===Film===
The experimental film &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot;, filmed by Louis Le Prince in Roundhay, Leeds, England, on October 14, 1888, is the earliest surviving motion picture. This movie was shot on paper film.

An experimental film camera was developed by British inventor William Friese Greene and patented in 1889. W. K. L. Dickson, working under the direction of Thomas Alva Edison, was the first to design a successful apparatus, the Kinetograph, patented in 1891. This camera took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard Eastman Kodak photographic emulsion coated onto a transparent celluloid strip 35 mm wide. The results of this work were first shown in public in 1893, using the viewing apparatus also designed by Dickson, the Kinetoscope. Contained within a large box, only one person at a time looking into it through a peephole could view the movie.

In the following year, Charles Francis Jenkins and his projector, the Phantoscope, made a successful audience viewing while Louis and Auguste Lumière perfected the Cinématographe, an apparatus that took, printed, and projected film, in Paris in December 1895. The Lumière brothers were the first to present projected, moving, photographic, pictures to a paying audience of more than one person.

In 1896, movie theaters were open in France (Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, Nice, Marseille); Italy (Rome, Milan, Naples, Genoa, Venice, Bologna, Forlì); Brussels; and London. The chronological improvements in the medium may be listed concisely. In 1896, Edison showed his improved Vitascope projector, the first commercially successful projector in the U.S. Cooper Hewitt invented mercury lamps which made it practical to shoot films indoors without sunlight in 1905. The first animated cartoon was produced in 1906. Credits began to appear at the beginning of motion pictures in 1911. The Bell and Howell 2709 movie camera invented in 1915 allowed directors to make close-ups without physically moving the camera. By the late 1920s, most of the movies produced were sound films. Wide screen formats were first experimented within the 1950s. By the 1970s, most movies were color films. IMAX and other 70mm formats gained popularity. Wide distribution of films became commonplace, setting the ground for &quot;blockbusters.&quot; Film cinematography dominated the motion picture industry from its inception until the 2010s when digital cinematography became dominant. Film cinematography is still used by some directors, especially in specific applications or out of fondness for the format.

===Black and white===

From its birth in the 1880s, movies were predominantly monochrome. Contrary to popular belief, monochrome does not always mean black-and-white; it means a movie shot in a single tone or color. Since the cost of tinted film bases was substantially higher, most movies were produced in black-and-white monochrome. Even with the advent of early color experiments, the greater expense of color meant films were mostly made in black-and-white until the 1950s, when cheaper color processes were introduced, and in some years percentage of films shot on color film surpassed 51%. By the 1960s, color became by far the dominant film stock. In the coming decades, the usage of color film greatly increased while monochrome films became scarce.

Black-and-white cinematography is a technique used in filmmaking where the images are captured and presented in shades of gray, without color. This artistic approach has a rich history and has been employed in various films throughout cinema&#x27;s evolution. It is a powerful tool that allows filmmakers to emphasize contrast, texture, and lighting, enhancing the visual storytelling experience. The use of black-and-white cinematography dates back to the early days of cinema when color film was not yet available. Filmmakers relied on this technique to create visually striking and atmospheric films. Even with the advent of color film technology, black-and-white cinematography continued to be utilized for artistic and thematic purposes.

Ken Dancyger&#x27;s book &quot;The Technique of Film and Video Editing: History, Theory, and Practice&quot; provides valuable insights into the historical and theoretical aspects of black-and-white cinematography. Dancyger explores how this technique has been employed throughout film history, examining its impact on storytelling, mood, and visual aesthetics. The book delves into the artistic choices and technical considerations involved in creating compelling black-and-white imagery, offering a comprehensive understanding of the technique.

Black-and-white cinematography allows filmmakers to focus on the interplay of light and shadow, emphasizing the contrast between different elements within a scene. This technique can evoke a sense of nostalgia, evoke a specific time period, or create a timeless and classic feel. By stripping away color, filmmakers can emphasize the composition, shapes, and textures within the frame, enhancing the visual impact. Notable films that have employed black-and-white cinematography include classics such as &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), and &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993). These films showcase the power and versatility of black-and-white cinematography in creating emotionally resonant visuals. Black-and-white cinematography remains a relevant and widely used technique in modern filmmaking. It continues to be employed by filmmakers to evoke specific moods, convey a sense of timelessness, and enhance the artistic expression of their stories.

===Color===
After the advent of motion pictures, a tremendous amount of energy was invested in the production of photography in natural color. The invention of the talking picture further increased the demand for the use of color photography. However, in comparison to other technological advances of the time, the arrival of color photography was a relatively slow process.

Early movies were not actually color movies since they were shot monochrome and hand-colored or machine-colored afterward (such movies are referred to as &quot;colored&quot; and not &quot;color&quot;). The earliest such example is the hand-tinted Annabelle Serpentine Dance in 1895 by Edison Manufacturing Company. Machine-based tinting later became popular. Tinting continued until the advent of natural color cinematography in the 1910s. Many black-and-white movies have been colorized recently using digital tinting. This includes footage shot from both world wars, sporting events and political propaganda.

In 1902, Edward Raymond Turner produced the first films with a natural color process rather than using colorization techniques. In 1909, Kinemacolor was first shown to the public.

In 1917, the earliest version of Technicolor was introduced. Kodachrome was introduced in 1935. Eastmancolor was introduced in 1950 and became the color standard for the rest of the century.

In the 2010s, color films were largely superseded by color digital cinematography.

===Digital video===
In digital cinematography, the movie is shot on digital media such as flash storage, as well as distributed through a digital medium such as a hard drive.

The basis for digital cameras are metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) image sensors. The first practical semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device (CCD), based on MOS capacitor technology. Following the commercialization of CCD sensors during the late 1970s to early 1980s, the entertainment industry slowly began transitioning to digital imaging and digital video over the next two decades. The CCD was followed by the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor), developed in the 1990s.

Beginning in the late 1980s, Sony began marketing the concept of &quot;electronic cinematography&quot;, utilizing its analog Sony HDVS professional video cameras. The effort met with very little success. However, this led to one of the earliest digitally shot feature movies, &quot;Julia and Julia&quot; (1987). In 1998, with the introduction of HDCAM recorders and 1920×1080 pixel digital professional video cameras based on CCD technology, the idea, now re-branded as &quot;digital cinematography&quot;, began to gain traction.

Shot and released in 1998, &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; is believed by some to be the first feature-length video shot and edited entirely on consumer-level digital equipment. In May 1999, George Lucas challenged the supremacy of the movie-making medium of film for the first time by including footage filmed with high-definition digital cameras in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. In late 2013, Paramount became the first major studio to distribute movies to theaters in digital format, eliminating 35mm film entirely. Since then the demand of movies to be developed onto digital format rather than 35mm has increased significantly.

As digital technology improved, movie studios began increasingly shifting toward digital cinematography. Since the 2010s, digital cinematography has become the dominant form of cinematography after largely superseding film cinematography.

== Aspects ==

Numerous aspects contribute to the art of cinematography, including:

===Cinema technique===
The first film cameras were fastened directly to the head of a tripod or other support, with only the crudest kind of leveling devices provided, in the manner of the still-camera tripod heads of the period. The earliest film cameras were thus effectively fixed during the shot, and hence the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle. The first known of these was a film shot by a Lumière cameraman from the back platform of a train leaving Jerusalem in 1896, and by 1898, there were a number of films shot from moving trains. Although listed under the general heading of &quot;panoramas&quot; in the sales catalogues of the time, those films shot straight forward from in front of a railway engine were usually specifically referred to as &quot;phantom rides&quot;.

In 1897, Robert W. Paul had the first real rotating camera head made to put on a tripod, so that he could follow the passing processions of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in one uninterrupted shot. This device had the camera mounted on a vertical axis that could be rotated by a worm gear driven by turning a crank handle, and Paul put it on general sale the next year. Shots taken using such a &quot;panning&quot; head were also referred to as &quot;panoramas&quot; in the film catalogues of the first decade of the cinema. This eventually led to the creation of a panoramic photo as well.

The standard pattern for early film studios was provided by the studio which Georges Méliès had built in 1897. This had a glass roof and three glass walls constructed after the model of large studios for still photography, and it was fitted with thin cotton cloths that could be stretched below the roof to diffuse the direct ray of the sun on sunny days. The soft overall light without real shadows that this arrangement produced, which also exists naturally on lightly overcast days, was to become the basis for film lighting in film studios for the next decade.

Black-and-white cinematography is a technique used in filmmaking where the images are captured and presented in shades of gray, without color. This artistic approach has a rich history and has been employed in various films throughout cinema&#x27;s evolution.

There are many types of Cinematography that each differ based on production purpose and process. These different types of Cinematography are similar in the sense that they all have the goal of conveying a specific emotion, mood or feeling. For each different style however they can often convey different emotions and purposes. Some examples of different types of Cinematography can be known as Realism. This style of cinematography aims to create a realistic portrayal of the world, often using natural lighting, handheld cameras, and a documentary-like approach to filming. Classic Hollywood is a style of cinematography characterized by its use of highly polished, studio-produced films with glamorous sets, bright lighting, and romanticized narratives. Film Noir is a style of cinematography that is characterized by its use of stark contrast and chiaroscuro lighting, low-key lighting, and a dark, brooding atmosphere. It often features crime, mystery, and morally ambiguous characters.

===Aspects of a cinema that affect a film===
To convey mood, emotion, narrative and other factors within the shot, cinematography is implemented by using different aspects within a film. 
Lighting on the scene can affect the mood of a scene or film. Darker shots with less natural light can be gloomy, scary, sad, intense. Brighter lighting can equate to a happier, exciting, more positive mood. Camera angle can affect a scene by setting perspective. It conveys how characters or the audience see something, and through what angle. Camera angle can also play an important role by highlighting either a close up detail, or background setting. A close up angle can highlight detail on someone&#x27;s face, while a wider lens can give key information that takes place in the background of a shot. Camera distance can highlight specific details that can be important to a film shot. From very far away, a group of people can all look the same, but once you zoom in very close, the viewer is able to see differences within the population through details like facial expression and body language. Coloring is similar to lighting, in the way that it plays an important role in setting mood and emotion throughout a shot. A color like green can convey balance and peace through scenes of nature. A shot with a lot of red can express anger, intensity, passion or love. While some of these emotions might not come out intentionally while seeing color, it is a subconscious fact that color within cinematography can have a large effect. Speed is a vital element in cinematography that can be used in a variety of ways, such as the creation of action, or a sense of movement. Speed can be further used to slow down time, highlight important moments, and often times build a sense of suspense in a film. Slow motion is a technique which involves filming at a higher frame rate, then playing the footage again at a normal speed. This creates a slowed-down effect in the film, which can put emphasis on or add fluidity to a scene. On the other hand, fast motion is the opposite of slow motion, filming at a lower frame rate and then playing the film back at a normal speed. This creates a sped-up effect which can help to emphasize passage of time, or create a sense of urgency. Time lapse is when you take a series of still photographs at a regular interval over a long period of time. From here, if you play them back continuously, a sped-up effect is shown. Time lapses are used most effectively to show things like sunrises, natural movement, or growth. They are commonly used to show passage of time in a shorter sequence. Reverse motion is filming a scene normally, then playing the film in reverse. This is usually used to create uncommon/surreal effects, and create unusual scenes. The various techniques involving speed all can add to a films intensity, vibe, show passage of time, and have many other effects. Camera movement within a film can play a role in enhancing the visual quality and impact of a film. Some aspects of camera movement that contribute to this are:
* Zooming: This movement involves changing the focal length of the lens to make the subject appear closer or farther away. It can be used to create a sense of intimacy or distance from the subject. 
* Tilt: Rotating the camera vertically from a fixed position. It can be used to show the height of a subject or to emphasize a particular element in the scene. 
* Panning: Rotating the camera horizontally from a fixed position. It can be used to follow a moving subject or to show a wide view of a scene.
* Pedestal/Booming/Jibbing: Moving a camera vertically in its entirety. This can be used to show vertical movement relative to a subject in a frame
* Trucking: Moving a camera horizontally in its entirety. This can be used to show horizontal movement relative to a subject in a frame
* Rolling: Rotating a camera in its entirety in a horizontal manner.

=== Image sensor and film stock ===
Cinematography can begin with digital image sensor or rolls of film. Advancements in film emulsion and grain structure provided a wide range of available film stocks. The selection of a film stock is one of the first decisions made in preparing a typical film production.

Aside from the film gauge selection – 8 mm (amateur), 16 mm (semi-professional), 35 mm (professional) and 65 mm (epic photography, rarely used except in special event venues) – the cinematographer has a selection of stocks in reversal (which, when developed, create a positive image) and negative formats along with a wide range of film speeds (varying sensitivity to light) from ISO 50 (slow, least sensitive to light) to 800 (very fast, extremely sensitive to light) and differing response to color (low saturation, high saturation) and contrast (varying levels between pure black (no exposure) and pure white (complete overexposure).
Advancements and adjustments to nearly all gauges of film create the &quot;super&quot; formats wherein the area of the film used to capture a single frame of an image is expanded, although the physical gauge of the film remains the same. Super 8 mm, Super 16 mm, and Super 35 mm all utilize more of the overall film area for the image than their &quot;regular&quot; non-super counterparts. The larger the film gauge, the higher the overall image resolution clarity and technical quality. The techniques used by the film laboratory to process the film stock can also offer a considerable variance in the image produced. By controlling the temperature and varying the duration in which the film is soaked in the development chemicals, and by skipping certain chemical processes (or partially skipping all of them), cinematographers can achieve very different looks from a single film stock in the laboratory. Some techniques that can be used are push processing, bleach bypass, and cross processing.

Most of modern cinema uses digital cinematography and has no film stocks , but the cameras themselves can be adjusted in ways that go far beyond the abilities of one particular film stock. They can provide varying degrees of color sensitivity, image contrast, light sensitivity and so on. One camera can achieve all the various looks of different emulsions. Digital image adjustments such as ISO and contrast are executed by estimating the same adjustments that would take place if actual film were in use, and are thus vulnerable to the camera&#x27;s sensor designers perceptions of various film stocks and image adjustment parameters.

=== Filters ===
Filters, such as diffusion filters or color effect filters, are also widely used to enhance mood or dramatic effects. Most photographic filters are made up of two pieces of optical glass glued together with some form of image or light manipulation material between the glass. In the case of color filters, there is often a translucent color medium pressed between two planes of optical glass. Color filters work by blocking out certain color wavelengths of light from reaching the film. With color film, this works very intuitively wherein a blue filter will cut down on the passage of red, orange, and yellow light and create a blue tint on the film. In black-and-white photography, color filters are used somewhat counter-intuitively; for instance, a yellow filter, which cuts down on blue wavelengths of light, can be used to darken a daylight sky (by eliminating blue light from hitting the film, thus greatly underexposing the mostly blue sky) while not biasing most human flesh tone. Filters can be used in front of the lens or, in some cases, behind the lens for different effects.

Certain cinematographers, such as Christopher Doyle, are well known for their innovative use of filters; Doyle was a pioneer for increased usage of filters in movies and is highly respected throughout the cinema world.

=== Lens ===

Lenses can be attached to the camera to give a certain look, feel, or effect by focus, color, etc. As does the human eye, the camera creates perspective and spatial relations with the rest of the world. However, unlike one&#x27;s eye, a cinematographer can select different lenses for different purposes. Variation in focal length is one of the chief benefits. The focal length of the lens determines the angle of view and, therefore, the field of view. Cinematographers can choose from a range of wide-angle lenses, &quot;normal&quot; lenses and long focus lenses, as well as macro lenses and other special effect lens systems such as borescope lenses. Wide-angle lenses have short focal lengths and make spatial distances more obvious. A person in the distance is shown as much smaller while someone in the front will loom large. On the other hand, long focus lenses reduce such exaggerations, depicting far-off objects as seemingly close together and flattening perspective. The differences between the perspective rendering is actually not due to the focal length by itself, but by the distance between the subjects and the camera. Therefore, the use of different focal lengths in combination with different camera to subject distances creates these different rendering. Changing the focal length only while keeping the same camera position does not affect perspective but the camera angle of view only.

A zoom lens allows a camera operator to change his focal length within a shot or quickly between setups for shots. As prime lenses offer greater optical quality and are &quot;faster&quot; (larger aperture openings, usable in less light) than zoom lenses, they are often employed in professional cinematography over zoom lenses. Certain scenes or even types of filmmaking, however, may require the use of zooms for speed or ease of use, as well as shots involving a zoom move.

As in other photography, the control of the exposed image is done in the lens with the control of the diaphragm aperture. For proper selection, the cinematographer needs that all lenses be engraved with T-stop, not f-stop so that the eventual light loss due to the glass does not affect the exposure control when setting it using the usual meters. The choice of the aperture also affects image quality (aberrations) and depth of field.

=== Depth of field and focus ===

Focal length and diaphragm aperture affect the depth of field of a scene – that is, how much the background, mid-ground and foreground will be rendered in &quot;acceptable focus&quot; (only one exact plane of the image is in precise focus) on the film or video target. Depth of field (not to be confused with depth of focus) is determined by the aperture size and the focal distance. A large or deep depth of field is generated with a very small iris aperture and focusing on a point in the distance, whereas a shallow depth of field will be achieved with a large (open) iris aperture and focusing closer to the lens. Depth of field is also governed by the format size. If one considers the field of view and angle of view, the smaller the image is, the shorter the focal length should be, as to keep the same field of view. Then, the smaller the image is, the more depth of field is obtained, for the same field of view. Therefore, 70mm has less depth of field than 35mm for a given field of view, 16mm more than 35mm, and early video cameras, as well as most modern consumer level video cameras, even more depth of field than 16mm.

In &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), cinematographer Gregg Toland and director Orson Welles used tighter apertures to create every detail of the foreground and background of the sets in sharp focus. This practice is known as deep focus. Deep focus became a popular cinematographic device from the 1940s onward in Hollywood. Today, the trend is for more shallow focus. To change the plane of focus from one object or character to another within a shot is commonly known as a &quot;rack focus&quot;.

Early in the transition to digital cinematography, the inability of digital video cameras to easily achieve shallow depth of field, due to their small image sensors, was initially an issue of frustration for film makers trying to emulate the look of 35mm film. Optical adapters were devised which accomplished this by mounting a larger format lens which projected its image, at the size of the larger format, on a ground glass screen preserving the depth of field. The adapter and lens then mounted on the small format video camera which in turn focused on the ground glass screen.

Digital SLR still cameras have sensor sizes similar to that of the 35mm film frame, and thus are able to produce images with similar depth of field. The advent of video functions in these cameras sparked a revolution in digital cinematography, with more and more film makers adopting still cameras for the purpose because of the film-like qualities of their images. More recently, more and more dedicated video cameras are being equipped with larger sensors capable of 35mm film-like depth of field.

=== Aspect ratio and framing ===
The aspect ratio of an image is the ratio of its width to its height. This can be expressed either as a ratio of 2 integers, such as 4:3, or in a decimal format, such as 1.33:1 or simply 1.33. Different ratios provide different aesthetic effects. Standards for aspect ratio have varied significantly over time.

During the silent era, aspect ratios varied widely, from square 1:1, all the way up to the extreme widescreen 4:1 Polyvision. However, from the 1910s, silent motion pictures generally settled on the ratio of 4:3 (1.33). The introduction of sound-on-film briefly narrowed the aspect ratio, to allow room for a sound stripe. In 1932, a new standard was introduced, the Academy ratio of 1.37, by means of thickening the frame line.

For years, mainstream cinematographers were limited to using the Academy ratio, but in the 1950s, thanks to the popularity of Cinerama, widescreen ratios were introduced in an effort to pull audiences back into the theater and away from their home television sets. These new widescreen formats provided cinematographers a wider frame within which to compose their images.

Many different proprietary photographic systems were invented and used in the 1950s to create widescreen movies, but one dominated film: the anamorphic process, which optically squeezes the image to photograph twice the horizontal area to the same size vertical as standard &quot;spherical&quot; lenses. The first commonly used anamorphic format was CinemaScope, which used a 2.35 aspect ratio, although it was originally 2.55. CinemaScope was used from 1953 to 1967, but due to technical flaws in the design and its ownership by Fox, several third-party companies, led by Panavision&#x27;s technical improvements in the 1950s, dominated the anamorphic cine lens market. Changes to SMPTE projection standards altered the projected ratio from 2.35 to 2.39 in 1970, although this did not change anything regarding the photographic anamorphic standards; all changes in respect to the aspect ratio of anamorphic 35 mm photography are specific to camera or projector gate sizes, not the optical system. After the &quot;widescreen wars&quot; of the 1950s, the motion-picture industry settled into 1.85 as a standard for theatrical projection in the United States and the United Kingdom. This is a cropped version of 1.37. Europe and Asia opted for 1.66 at first, although 1.85 has largely permeated these markets in recent decades. Certain &quot;epic&quot; or adventure movies utilized the anamorphic 2.39 (often incorrectly denoted &#x27;2.40&#x27;)

In the 1990s, with the advent of high-definition video, television engineers created the 1.78 (16:9) ratio as a mathematical compromise between the theatrical standard of 1.85 and television&#x27;s 1.33, as it was not practical to produce a traditional CRT television tube with a width of 1.85. Until that change, nothing had ever been originated in 1.78. Today, this is a standard for high-definition video and for widescreen television.

=== Lighting ===

Light is necessary to create an image exposure on a frame of film or on a digital target (CCD, etc.). The art of lighting for cinematography goes far beyond basic exposure, however, into the essence of visual storytelling. Lighting contributes considerably to the emotional response an audience has watching a motion picture. The increased usage of filters can greatly impact the final image and affect the lighting.

Importance of Lighting in Film
Lighting in film is essential for three primary reasons: visibility, composition, and mood. Firstly, lighting ensures that the subject or scene is properly illuminated, allowing viewers to perceive the details and understand the narrative. It helps in guiding the audience&#x27;s attention to specific elements within the frame, highlighting important characters or objects. Secondly, lighting contributes to the composition of a shot. Filmmakers strategically place lights to create balance, depth, and visual interest within the frame. It allows them to control the visual elements within the scene, emphasizing certain areas and de-emphasizing others. Lastly, lighting significantly impacts the mood and atmosphere of a film. By manipulating light intensity, color, and direction, filmmakers can evoke different emotions and enhance the narrative. Bright, even lighting may evoke a sense of safety and happiness, while low-key lighting with shadows can create tension, mystery, or fear. The choice of lighting style can also reflect the genre of the film, such as the high contrast lighting commonly used in film noir.

=== Lighting Techniques ===

Numerous lighting techniques are employed in filmmaking to achieve desired effects. Here are some commonly used techniques:
Three-Point Lighting: This classic technique involves the use of three lights: the key light, fill light, and backlight. The key light serves as the primary source, illuminating the subject from one side to create depth and dimension. The fill light reduces shadows caused by the key light, softening the overall lighting. The backlight separates the subject from the background, providing a halo effect and enhancing the sense of depth.
High Key Lighting: High key lighting produces a bright, evenly lit scene, often used in comedies or light-hearted films. It minimizes shadows, creating a cheerful and upbeat atmosphere.
Low Key Lighting: Low key lighting involves using a single key light or a few strategically placed lights to create strong contrasts and deep shadows. This technique is commonly used in film noir and horror genres to evoke suspense, mystery, or fear.

=== Natural Lighting ===

Filmmakers sometimes employ natural lighting to create an authentic, realistic look. This technique utilizes existing light sources, such as sunlight or practical lamps, without additional artificial lighting. It is often seen in outdoor scenes or films aiming for a naturalistic aesthetic.
Color Lighting: The use of colored lights or gels can dramatically alter the mood and atmosphere of a scene. Different colors evoke different emotions and can enhance storytelling. For example, warm tones like red or orange may create a sense of warmth or passion, while cool tones like blue can convey sadness or isolation.

=== Camera movement ===

Cinematography can not only depict a moving subject but can use a camera, which represents the audience&#x27;s viewpoint or perspective, that moves during the course of filming. This movement plays a considerable role in the emotional language of film images and the audience&#x27;s emotional reaction to the action. Techniques range from the most basic movements of panning (horizontal shift in viewpoint from a fixed position; like turning your head side-to-side) and tilting (vertical shift in viewpoint from a fixed position; like tipping your head back to look at the sky or down to look at the ground) to dollying (placing the camera on a moving platform to move it closer or farther from the subject), tracking (placing the camera on a moving platform to move it to the left or right), craning (moving the camera in a vertical position; being able to lift it off the ground as well as swing it side-to-side from a fixed base position), and combinations of the above. Early cinematographers often faced problems that were not common to other graphic artists because of the element of motion.

Cameras have been mounted to nearly every imaginable form of transportation. Most cameras can also be handheld, that is held in the hands of the camera operator who moves from one position to another while filming the action. Personal stabilizing platforms came into being in the late 1970s through the invention of Garrett Brown, which became known as the Steadicam. The Steadicam is a body harness and stabilization arm that connects to the camera, supporting the camera while isolating it from the operator&#x27;s body movements. After the Steadicam patent expired in the early 1990s, many other companies began manufacturing their concept of the personal camera stabilizer. This invention is much more common throughout the cinematic world today. From feature-length films to the evening news, more and more networks have begun to use a personal camera stabilizer.

== Special effects ==
The first special effects in the cinema were created while the film was being shot. These came to be known as &quot;in-camera&quot; effects. Later, optical and digital effects were developed so that editors and visual effects artists could more tightly control the process by manipulating the film in post-production.

The 1896 movie The Execution of Mary Stuart shows an actor dressed as the queen placing her head on the execution block in front of a small group of bystanders in Elizabethan dress. The executioner brings his axe down, and the queen&#x27;s severed head drops onto the ground. This trick was worked by stopping the camera and replacing the actor with a dummy, then restarting the camera before the axe falls. The two pieces of film were then trimmed and cemented together so that the action appeared continuous when the film was shown, thus creating an overall illusion and successfully laying the foundation for special effects.

This film was among those exported to Europe with the first Kinetoscope machines in 1895 and was seen by Georges Méliès, who was putting on magic shows in his Théâtre Robert-Houdin in Paris at the time. He took up filmmaking in 1896, and after making imitations of other films from Edison, Lumière, and Robert Paul, he made &quot;Escamotage d&#x27;un dame chez Robert-Houdin (The Vanishing Lady)&quot;. This film shows a woman being made to vanish by using the same stop motion technique as the earlier Edison film. After this, Georges Méliès made many single shot films using this trick over the next couple of years.

===Double exposure===

The other basic technique for trick cinematography involves double exposure of the film in the camera, which was first done by George Albert Smith in July 1898 in the UK. Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot; (1898) was described in the catalogue of the Warwick Trading Company, which took up the distribution of Smith&#x27;s films in 1900, thus:
&quot;One of the twin brothers returns home from shooting in the Corsican mountains, and is visited by the ghost of the other twin. By extremely careful photography the ghost appears *quite transparent*. After indicating that he has been killed by a sword-thrust, and appealing for vengeance, he disappears. A &#x27;vision&#x27; then appears showing the fatal duel in the snow. To the Corsican&#x27;s amazement, the duel and death of his brother are vividly depicted in the vision, and overcome by his feelings, he falls to the floor just as his mother enters the room.&quot;
The ghost effect was done by draping the set in black velvet after the main action had been shot, and then re-exposing the negative with the actor playing the ghost going through the actions at the appropriate part. Likewise, the vision, which appeared within a circular vignette or matte, was similarly superimposed over a black area in the backdrop to the scene, rather than over a part of the set with detail in it, so that nothing appeared through the image, which seemed quite solid. Smith used this technique again in &quot;Santa Claus&quot; (1898).

Georges Méliès first used superimposition on a dark background in &quot;La Caverne maudite (The Cave of the Demons)&quot; made a couple of months later in 1898, and elaborated it with many superimpositions in the one shot in &quot;Un Homme de têtes (The Four Troublesome Heads)&quot;. He created further variations in subsequent films.

=== Frame rate selection ===

Motion picture images are presented to an audience at a constant speed. In the theater it is 24 frames per second, in NTSC (US) Television it is 30 frames per second (29.97 to be exact), in PAL (Europe) television it is 25 frames per second. This speed of presentation does not vary.

However, by varying the speed at which the image is captured, various effects can be created knowing that the faster or slower recorded image will be played at a constant speed. Giving the cinematographer even more freedom for creativity and expression to be made.

For instance, time-lapse photography is created by exposing an image at an extremely slow rate. If a cinematographer sets a camera to expose one frame every minute for four hours, and then that footage is projected at 24 frames per second, a four-hour event will take 10 seconds to present, and one can present the events of a whole day (24 hours) in just one minute.

The inverse of this, if an image is captured at speeds above that at which they will be presented, the effect is to greatly slow down (slow motion) the image. If a cinematographer shoots a person diving into a pool at 96 frames per second, and that image is played back at 24 frames per second, the presentation will take 4 times as long as the actual event. Extreme slow motion, capturing many thousands of frames per second can present things normally invisible to the human eye, such as bullets in flight and shockwaves travelling through media, a potentially powerful cinematographic technique.

In motion pictures, the manipulation of time and space is a considerable contributing factor to the narrative storytelling tools. Film editing plays a much stronger role in this manipulation, but frame rate selection in the photography of the original action is also a contributing factor to altering time. For example, Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Modern Times&quot; was shot at &quot;silent speed&quot; (18 fps) but projected at &quot;sound speed&quot; (24 fps), which makes the slapstick action appear even more frenetic.

Speed ramping, or simply &quot;ramping&quot;, is a process whereby the capture frame rate of the camera changes over time. For example, if in the course of 10 seconds of capture, the capture frame rate is adjusted from 60 frames per second to 24 frames per second, when played back at the standard movie rate of 24 frames per second, a unique time-manipulation effect is achieved. For example, someone pushing a door open and walking out into the street would appear to start off in slow-motion, but in a few seconds later within the same shot, the person would appear to walk in &quot;realtime&quot; (normal speed). The opposite speed-ramping is done in &quot;The Matrix&quot; when Neo re-enters the Matrix for the first time to see the Oracle. As he comes out of the warehouse &quot;load-point&quot;, the camera zooms into Neo at normal speed but as it gets closer to Neo&#x27;s face, time seems to slow down, foreshadowing the manipulation of time itself within the Matrix later in the movie.

===Reverse and slow motion===
G. A. Smith initiated the technique of reverse motion and also improved the quality of self-motivating images. This he did by repeating the action a second time while filming it with an inverted camera and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first. The first films using this were &quot;Tipsy, Topsy, Turvy,&quot; and &quot;The Awkward Sign Painter&quot;, the latter which showed a sign painter lettering a sign, and then the painting on the sign vanishing under the painter&#x27;s brush. The earliest surviving example of this technique is Smith&#x27;s &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;, made before September 1901. Here, a small boy is shown knocking down a castle just constructed by a little girl out of children&#x27;s building blocks. A title then appears, saying &quot;Reversed&quot;, and the action is repeated in reverse so that the castle re-erects itself under his blows.

Cecil Hepworth improved upon this technique by printing the negative of the forward motion backward, frame by frame, so that in the production of the print the original action was exactly reversed. Hepworth made &quot;The Bathers&quot; in 1900 in which bathers who have undressed and jumped into the water appear to spring backward out of it, and have their clothe magically fly back onto their bodies.

The use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900. Robert Paul&#x27;s &quot;On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus&quot; (1899), had the camera turn so slowly that when the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed. Cecil Hepworth used the opposite effect in &quot;The Indian Chief and the Seidlitz powder&quot; (1901), in which a naïve Red Indian eats a lot of the fizzy stomach medicine, causing his stomach to expand and then he then leaps around balloon-like. This was done by cranking the camera faster than the normal 16 frames per second giving the first &quot;slow motion&quot; effect.

== Personnel ==

In descending order of seniority, the following staff is involved:

* Director of photography, also called cinematographer
* Camera operator, also called cameraman
* First assistant camera, also called focus puller
* Second assistant camera, also called clapper loader

In the film industry, the cinematographer is responsible for the technical aspects of the images (lighting, lens choices, composition, exposure, filtration, film selection), but works closely with the director to ensure that the artistic aesthetics are supporting the director&#x27;s vision of the story being told. The cinematographers are the heads of the camera, grip and lighting crew on a set, and for this reason, they are often called directors of photography or DPs. The American Society of Cinematographers defines cinematography as a creative and interpretive process that culminates in the authorship of an original work of art rather than the simple recording of a physical event. Cinematography is not a subcategory of photography. Rather, photography is but one craft that the cinematographer uses in addition to other physical, organizational, managerial, interpretive. and image-manipulating techniques to effect one coherent process.
In British tradition, if the DOP actually operates the camera him/herself they are called the &quot;cinematographer&quot;. On smaller productions, it is common for one person to perform all these functions alone. The career progression usually involves climbing up the ladder from seconding, firsting, eventually to operating the camera.

Directors of photography make many interpretive decisions during the course of their work, from pre-production to post-production, all of which affect the overall feel and look of the motion picture. Many of these decisions are similar to what a photographer needs to note when taking a picture: the cinematographer controls the film choice itself (from a range of available stocks with varying sensitivities to light and color), the selection of lens focal lengths, aperture exposure and focus. Cinematography, however, has a temporal aspect (see persistence of vision), unlike still photography, which is purely a single still image. It is also bulkier and more strenuous to deal with movie cameras, and it involves a more complex array of choices. As such a cinematographer often needs to work cooperatively with more people than does a photographer, who could frequently function as a single person. As a result, the cinematographer&#x27;s job also includes personnel management and logistical organization. Given the in-depth knowledge, a cinematographer requires not only of his or her own craft but also that of other personnel, formal tuition in analogue or digital filmmaking can be advantageous.

<text>USS &quot;Rhode Island&quot; (BB-17) was the last of five s built for the United States Navy, and was the second ship to carry her name. She was laid down in May 1902, launched in May 1904, and commissioned into the Atlantic Fleet in February 1906. The ship was armed with an offensive battery of four guns and eight guns, and she was capable of a top speed of .

The ship&#x27;s career primarily consisted of training with the other battleships of the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Rhode Island&quot; took part in the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 1907–1909, and thereafter largely remained in the Atlantic. In late 1913, she cruised the Caribbean coast of Mexico to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was assigned to anti-submarine patrols off the east coast of the US. Starting in December 1918, after the end of the war, the ship was used to repatriate American soldiers. She carried over 5,000 men in the course of five trips. She was briefly transferred to the Pacific Fleet in 1919 before being decommissioned in 1920 and sold for scrap in 1923 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Design==
Design work on the began in 1899, after the United States&#x27; victory in the Spanish–American War, which had demonstrated the need for sea-going battleships suitable for operations abroad, finally resolving the debate between proponents of that type and those who favored low-freeboard types useful for coastal defense. The designers included a superposed arrangement of the main and some of the secondary guns, which proved to be a significant disappointment in service, as firing either set of guns interfered with the others, slowing the rate of fire.

&quot;Rhode Island&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , with steam provided by twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by cage masts in 1909. She had a crew of 812 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four /40 caliber Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /45 caliber guns and twelve /50 caliber guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets; two of these were superposed atop the main battery turrets, with the other two turrets abreast the forward funnel. The 6-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twelve /50 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. She also carried two 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Rhode Island&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and elsewhere. The faces of the main battery gun turrets (and the secondary turrets on top of them) were thick. Each turret rested on a supporting barbettes that had of armor plating. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==
===Early career and the Great White Fleet===
&quot;Rhode Island&quot; was laid down at the Fore River Shipyard in Massachusetts on 1 May 1902 and was launched on 17 May 1904, to little fanfare due to a worker strike at the shipyard. Upon launching, the ship became stuck on a mud bank where she remained before being towed afloat two days later. The ship was completed a year later, and on 19 February 1906 commissioned into the fleet. The ship conducted an extensive shakedown cruise and sea trials before steaming to Hampton Roads, where she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron, Atlantic Fleet on 1 January 1907. She left Hampton Roads on 9 March 1907, bound for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. There, she and the rest of the 1st Squadron conducted maneuvers and gunnery training. After the conclusion of these exercises, she returned to the east coast of the United States for a cruise to Cape Cod Bay.

On 8 December, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; returned to Hampton Roads, where she and fifteen other battleships held a naval review at the start of the cruise of the Great White Fleet. The battleships were joined by transports and a squadron of torpedo boats. On 16 December, President Theodore Roosevelt reviewed the fleet before it departed on the first leg of the trip. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression. The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice.

The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. The fleet then turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled . There, they conducted a naval review for Theodore Roosevelt.

===1909–1923===
After the conclusion of the review, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; steamed to New York for an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. During the overhaul, on 8 March, the ship was assigned to the 3rd Division, 1st Squadron. After emerging from the dry dock, she resumed her normal peacetime routine of maneuvers with the rest of the squadron, gunnery practice, and training cruises. In February 1910 she was sent on a cruise in the Caribbean. The ship was reassigned to the 4th Division, 1st Squadron on 20 October, and two weeks later she and the rest of the squadron held a naval review in Boston for President William Howard Taft on 2 November. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to visit European ports; &quot;Rhode Island&quot; went to Gravesend. During the cruise, the fleet conducted large scale battle and reconnaissance training. &quot;Rhode Island&quot; and the rest of the ships recrossed the Atlantic and stopped in Guantánamo Bay on 13 January 1911.

The ship then resumed her peacetime routine, which lasted for the next three years, punctuated only by a cruise to Key West, Florida and Havana and Guantánamo Bay in Cuba in June – July 1912. Upon her return, she was reassigned temporarily as the flagship of the 3rd Division on 17 July. This duty was short-lived, and on 1 August the divisional commander transferred his flag to her sister ship . On 28 June 1913, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; again became the divisional flagship, and this stint lasted until 18 January 1914. In late 1913, the US Navy began to become increasingly involved in the Mexican Revolution; in late 1913, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; cruised off Veracruz, Tampico, and Tuxpan to protect American nationals in the country. In February 1914, the ship left the area and stopped in Guantánamo Bay for two weeks before continuing on to the United States to return to her normal routine.

The ship went on two cruises to show the flag in the Caribbean, the first from October 1914 to March 1915, and the second from January to February 1916. During this period, she served as the flagship for the 4th Division, 1st Squadron, from 19 December 1914 to 20 January 1915. On 15 May 1916, she was reduced to the fleet reserve at the Boston Navy Yard, and formally removed from the Atlantic Fleet the following day. From 24 June to 28 September, she served as the flagship of the Commander in Chief, Reserve Force, Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was placed back in commission on 27 March 1917, as tensions with Germany rose dramatically as the result of the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign that had been launched earlier in the year. The United States declared war on 6 April, and on 3 May, the ship became the flagship of Battleship Division 3, Atlantic Fleet. The ship&#x27;s crew underwent extensive training to bring the ship up to combat readiness before she was assigned to anti-submarine patrols off Tangier Island, Maryland. She was based out of Hampton Roads into 1918.

In April, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was transferred to Battleship Division 2, and in June, she conducted torpedo proving trials. At the end of the war in November, the ship was assigned to the operation to transport American soldiers back from France. The first trip started on 18 December; &quot;Rhode Island&quot; and steamed to Brest, France, where they arrived on 30 December. The two ships took on 2,043 men between them during a three-day stay in the port. Over the course of four further trips, the last of which ended on 4 July 1919, she carried more than 5,000 men to Boston. On 17 July, she was assigned as the flagship of Battleship Squadron 1, Pacific Fleet. She left Boston five days later and cruised down to Balboa, at the entrance to the Panama Canal. After transiting the canal, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; steamed north, to Mare Island Navy Yard, where she remained through 1920. On 30 June, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve. According to the terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was sold for scrap on 1 November 1923 and broken up. The ship&#x27;s bell is preserved on display at the Rhode Island State House.

<text>Laura Elizabeth Ingalls Wilder (February 7, 1867 – February 10, 1957) was an American writer, teacher, and journalist. She is best known as the author of the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, published between 1932 and 1943, which were based on her childhood in a settler and pioneer family.

==Birth and ancestry==

Laura Elizabeth Ingalls was born to Charles Phillip and Caroline Lake (née Quiner) Ingalls on February 7, 1867. At the time of her birth, the family lived seven miles north of the village of Pepin, Wisconsin, in the Big Woods region of Wisconsin. Ingalls&#x27; home in Pepin became the setting for her first book, &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; (1932). She was the second of five children, following her older sister, Mary Amelia. Three more children would follow, Caroline Celestia (Carrie), Charles Frederick, who died in infancy, and Grace Pearl. Wilder&#x27;s birth site is commemorated by a replica log cabin at the Little House Wayside in Pepin.

Ingalls was a descendant of the Delano family, the ancestral family of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. One paternal ancestor, Edmund Ingalls, from Skirbeck, Lincolnshire, England, emigrated to America, settling in Lynn, Massachusetts. In addition, Laura was the 7th great-granddaughter of the Mayflower passenger Richard Warren, and a third cousin once removed of the U.S. President and Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant.

===Early life===
When she was two years old, Laura moved with her family from Wisconsin (in 1869). After stopping in Rothville, Missouri, they settled in the Indian country of Kansas, near modern-day Independence, Kansas. Her younger sister, Carrie, was born in Independence in August 1870, not long before they moved again. According to Wilder, her father Charles Ingalls had been told that the location would be open to white settlers, but when they arrived this was not the case. The Ingalls family had no legal right to occupy their homestead because it was on the Osage Indian reservation. They had just begun to farm when they heard rumors that settlers would be evicted, so they left in the spring of 1871. Despite the fact that, in her novel, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and her &quot;Pioneer Girl&quot; memoir, Ingalls portrayed their departure as being prompted by rumors of eviction, she also noted that her parents needed to recover their Wisconsin land because the buyer had not paid the mortgage.

The Ingalls family went back to Wisconsin, where they lived for the next three years. Those experiences formed the basis for Wilder&#x27;s first two novels, &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; (1932) and the beginning of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; (1935).

In the book &quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek&quot; (published in 1939), the third volume of her fictionalized history which takes place around 1874, the Ingalls family moves from Kansas to an area near Walnut Grove, Minnesota, settling in a dugout on the banks of Plum Creek. They moved there from Wisconsin when Ingalls was about seven years old, after briefly living with the family of her uncle, Peter Ingalls, first in Wisconsin and then on rented land near Lake City, Minnesota. In Walnut Grove, the family first lived in a dugout sod house on a preemption claim; after wintering in it, they moved into a new house built on the same land. Two summers of ruined crops led them to move to Iowa. On the way, they stayed again with Charles Ingalls&#x27; brother, Peter Ingalls, this time on his farm near South Troy, Minnesota. Her brother, Charles Frederick Ingalls (&quot;Freddie&quot;), was born there on November 1, 1875, dying nine months later in August 1876. In Burr Oak, Iowa, the family helped run a hotel. The youngest of the Ingalls children, Grace, was born there on May 23, 1877. The family moved from Burr Oak back to Walnut Grove, where Charles Ingalls served as the town butcher and justice of the peace. He accepted a railroad job in the spring of 1879, which took him to eastern Dakota Territory, where they joined him that fall. In writing &quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek&quot;, Wilder omitted the period between 1876–1877 when they lived near Burr Oak, skipping directly to the Dakota Territory, featured in &quot;By the Shores of Silver Lake&quot; (1939).
Over the winter of 1879-1880, Charles Ingalls filed for a formal homestead in De Smet, South Dakota . The family spent that mild winter in the surveyor&#x27;s house. However, the following winter, known as the Hard Winter of 1880–81, was one of the most severe on record in the Dakotas, an ordeal described by Wilder in her novel, &quot;The Long Winter&quot; (1940). Once the family was settled in De Smet, Laura attended school, worked several part-time jobs, and made friends. Among them was bachelor homesteader Almanzo Wilder. This time in her life is documented in the books &quot;Little Town on the Prairie&quot; (1941) and &quot;These Happy Golden Years&quot; (1943). Charles and Caroline Ingalls, along with Mary Ingalls, remained in De Smet for the rest of their lives.

===Young teacher===
On December 10, 1882, two months before her 16th birthday, Ingalls accepted her first teaching position. She taught three terms in one-room schools when she was not attending school in De Smet. (In &quot;Little Town on the Prairie&quot; she receives her first teaching certificate on December 24, 1882, but that was an enhancement for dramatic effect.) Her original &quot;Third Grade&quot; teaching certificate can be seen on page 25 of William Anderson&#x27;s book &quot;Laura&#x27;s Album&quot; (1998). She later admitted she did not particularly enjoy it, but felt a responsibility from a young age to help her family financially, and wage-earning opportunities for women were limited. Between 1883 and 1885, she taught three terms of school, worked for the local dressmaker, and attended high school, although she did not graduate. (According to the books, this was due to her third and final teaching job starting before her schooling finished.)

===Early marriage years===

Ingalls&#x27; teaching career and studies ended when she married Almanzo Wilder on August 25, 1885, in De Smet, South Dakota. From the beginning of their relationship, the pair had nicknames for each other: she called him &quot;Manly&quot; and he called her &quot;Bess,&quot; from her middle name Elizabeth, to avoid confusion with his sister, who was also named Laura. Almanzo had achieved a degree of prosperity on his homestead claim; the newly married couple started their life together in a new home, north of De Smet.

On December 5, 1886, Wilder gave birth to her daughter, Rose. In 1889, she gave birth to a son who died at 12 days of age before being named. He was buried at De Smet, Kingsbury County, South Dakota. On the grave marker, he is remembered as &quot;Baby Son of A. J. Wilder.&quot;

Their first few years of marriage were difficult. Complications from a life-threatening bout of diphtheria in 1888 left Almanzo partially paralyzed. Although he eventually regained nearly full use of his legs, he needed a cane to walk for the remainder of his life. This setback, among many others, began a series of unfortunate events that included the death of their newborn son, the destruction of their barn along with its hay and grain by a mysterious fire, the total loss of their home from a fire accidentally set by Rose, and several years of severe drought that left them in debt, physically ill, and unable to earn a living from their 320 acres (129.5 hectares) of prairie land. These trials were documented in Wilder&#x27;s book &quot;The First Four Years&quot; (published in 1971). Around 1890, they left De Smet and spent about a year resting at the home of Almanzo&#x27;s parents on their Spring Valley, Minnesota, farm before moving briefly to Westville, Florida, in search of a climate to improve Almanzo&#x27;s health. They found, however, that the dry plains they were used to were very different from the humidity they encountered in Westville. The weather, along with feeling out of place among the locals, encouraged their return to De Smet in 1892, where they purchased a small home.

==Move to Mansfield, Missouri==
In 1894, the Wilders moved to Mansfield, Missouri, and used their savings to make the down payment on an undeveloped parcel of land just outside town. They named the place Rocky Ridge Farm and moved into a ramshackle log cabin. At first, they earned income only from wagon loads of fire wood they would sell in town for 50 cents. Financial security came slowly. Apple trees they planted did not bear fruit for seven years. Almanzo&#x27;s parents visited around that time and gave them the deed to the house they had been renting in Mansfield, which was the economic boost Wilder&#x27;s family needed. They then added to the property outside town, and eventually accrued nearly 200 acres (80.9 hectares). Around 1910, they sold the house in town, moved back to the farm, and completed the farmhouse with the proceeds. What began as about 40 acres (16.2 hectares) of thickly wooded, stone-covered hillside with a windowless log cabin became in 20 years a relatively prosperous poultry, dairy, and fruit farm, and a 10-room farmhouse.

The Wilders had learned from cultivating wheat as their sole crop in De Smet. They diversified Rocky Ridge Farm with poultry, a dairy farm, and a large apple orchard. Wilder became active in various clubs and was an advocate for several regional farm associations. She was recognized as an authority in poultry farming and rural living, which led to invitations to speak to groups around the region.

==Writing career==
An invitation to submit an article to the &quot;Missouri Ruralist&quot; in 1911 led to Wilder&#x27;s permanent position as a columnist and editor with that publication, which she held until the mid-1920s. She also took a paid position with the local Farm Loan Association, dispensing small loans to local farmers.

Wilder&#x27;s column in the &quot;Ruralist&quot;, &quot;As a Farm Woman Thinks,&quot; introduced her to a loyal audience of rural Ozarkians, who enjoyed her regular columns. Her topics ranged from home and family, including her 1915 trip to San Francisco, California to visit her now-married daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, and see the Pan-Pacific exhibition, to World War I and other world events, and to the fascinating world travels of Lane as well as her own thoughts on the increasing options offered to women during this era. While the couple were never wealthy until the &quot;Little House&quot; books began to achieve popularity, the farming operation and Wilder&#x27;s income from writing and the Farm Loan Association provided them with a stable living.

&quot;[By] 1924&quot;, according to the Professor John E. Miller, &quot;[a]fter more than a decade of writing for farm papers, Wilder had become a disciplined writer, able to produce thoughtful, readable prose for a general audience.&quot; 

Around this time her daughter, Lane, began intensively encouraging Wilder to improve her writing skills with a view toward greater success as a writer than Lane had already achieved. The Wilders, according to Miller, had come to &quot;[depend] on annual income subsidies from their increasingly famous and successful daughter.&quot; They both had concluded that the solution for improving their retirement income was for Wilder to become a successful writer herself. As a start, Lane helped Wilder publish two articles describing the interior of the farmhouse, in &quot;Country Gentleman&quot; magazine. However, the &quot;project never proceeded very far.&quot;

In 1928, Lane hired out the construction of an English-style stone cottage for her parents on property adjacent to the farmhouse they had personally built and still inhabited. She remodeled and took it over.

The Stock Market Crash of 1929 wiped the Wilders out; Lane&#x27;s investments were devastated as well. They still owned the 200-acre (81-hectare) farm, but they had invested most of their savings with Lane&#x27;s broker. 

In 1930, Wilder requested Lane&#x27;s opinion about an autobiographical manuscript she had written about her pioneering childhood. The Great Depression, coupled with the deaths of Wilder&#x27;s mother in 1924 and her older sister in 1928, seem to have prompted her to preserve her memories in a life story called &quot;Pioneer Girl&quot;. She also hoped that her writing would generate some additional income. 

The original title of the first of the books was &quot;When Grandma Was a Little Girl&quot;. On the advice of Lane&#x27;s publisher, she greatly expanded the story. As a result of Lane&#x27;s publishing connections as a successful writer and after editing by her, Harper &amp; Brothers published Wilder&#x27;s book in 1932 as &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot;. After its success, she continued writing. The close and often rocky collaboration between her and Lane continued, in person until 1935, when Lane permanently left Rocky Ridge Farm, and afterward by correspondence.

The collaboration worked both ways: two of Lane&#x27;s most successful novels, &quot;Let the Hurricane Roar&quot; (1932) and &quot;Free Land&quot; (1938), were written at the same time as the &quot;Little House&quot; series and basically retold Ingalls and Wilder family tales in an adult format.

=== Authorship ===
Some, including Lane&#x27;s biographer William Holtz, have alleged that Wilder&#x27;s daughter was her ghostwriter. Existing evidence including ongoing correspondence between the women about the books&#x27; development, Lane&#x27;s extensive diaries, and Wilder&#x27;s handwritten manuscripts with edit notations shows an ongoing collaboration between the two women.

Miller, using this record, describes varying levels of involvement by Lane. &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; (1932) and &quot;These Happy Golden Years&quot; (1943), he notes, received the least editing. &quot;The first pages...and other large sections of [&quot;Big Woods&quot;],&quot; he observes, &quot;stand largely intact, indicating...from the start...[Laura&#x27;s] talent for narrative description.&quot; Some volumes saw heavier participation by Lane, while &quot;The First Four Years&quot; (1971) appears to be exclusively a Wilder work.
Miller concludes that, &quot;[i]n the end, the lasting literary legacy remains that of the mother more than that of the daughter... Lane possessed style; Wilder had substance.&quot;

The controversy over authorship is often tied to the movement to read the Little House series through an ideological lens. Lane emerged in the 1930s as an avowed conservative polemicist and critic of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration and his New Deal programs. According to a 2012 article in the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, &quot;When Roosevelt was elected, she noted in her diary, &#x27;America has a dictator.&#x27; She prayed for his assassination, and considered doing the job herself.&quot; Whatever Lane&#x27;s politics, &quot;attacks on [Wilder&#x27;s] authorship seem aimed at infusing her books with ideological passions they just don&#x27;t have.&quot;

On the topic of historical fiction and its influence on modern views of race relations, literary scholar Rachelle Kuehl notes that Wilder’s &quot;Little House&quot; series has received backlash for her problematic portrayal of Native Americans.

=== Enduring appeal ===
The original Little House books, written for elementary school–age children, became an enduring, eight-volume record of pioneering life late in the 19th century based on the Ingalls family&#x27;s experiences on the American frontier. Irene Smith said shortly after &quot;These Happy Golden Years (1943) was published that Wilder began &quot;with a style appealing to the eight-year-olds and continuing in volumes of increasing length and difficulty. This graduation is a distinguishing feature of the Little House books.&quot; &quot;The First Four Years&quot;, about the early days of the Wilder marriage, was discovered by her literary executor Roger MacBride after Lane&#x27;s 1968 death and published in 1971, unedited by Lane or MacBride. It is now marketed as the ninth volume.

Since the publication of &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; (1932), the books have been continuously in print and have been translated into 40 other languages. Wilder&#x27;s first—and smallest—royalty check from Harper, in 1932, was for $500, . By the mid-1930s the royalties from the &quot;Little House&quot; books brought a steady and increasingly substantial income to the Wilders for the first time in their 50 years of marriage. The collaboration also brought the two writers at Rocky Ridge Farm the money they needed to recoup the loss of their investments in the stock market. Various honors, huge amounts of fan mail, and other accolades were bestowed on Wilder.

===Autobiography: &quot;Pioneer Girl&quot;===
In 1929–1930, in her early 60s, Wilder began writing her autobiography, titled &quot;Pioneer Girl.&quot; It was rejected by publishers. At Lane&#x27;s urging, she rewrote most of her stories for children. The result was the &quot;Little House&quot; series of books. In 2014, the South Dakota State Historical Society published an annotated version of Wilder&#x27;s autobiography, titled &quot;Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography&quot;.

&quot;Pioneer Girl&quot; includes stories that Wilder felt were inappropriate for children: e.g., a man accidentally immolating himself while drunk, and an incident of extreme violence of a local shopkeeper against his wife, which ended with his setting their house on fire. She also describes previously unknown facets of her father&#x27;s character. According to its publisher, &quot;Wilder&#x27;s fiction, her autobiography, and her real childhood are all distinct things, but they are closely intertwined.&quot; The book&#x27;s aim was to explore the differences, including incidents with conflicting or non-existing accounts in one or another of the sources.

==Later life and death==
Upon Lane&#x27;s departure from Rocky Ridge Farm, Laura and Almanzo moved back into the farmhouse they had built, which had most recently been occupied by friends. From 1935 on, they were alone at Rocky Ridge Farm. Most of the surrounding area (including the property with the stone cottage Lane had built for them) was sold, but they still kept some farm animals, and tended their flower beds and vegetable gardens. Almost daily, carloads of fans stopped by, eager to meet the &quot;Laura&quot; of the &quot;Little House&quot; books.

The Wilders lived independently and without financial worries until Almanzo&#x27;s death at the farm in 1949. Wilder remained on the farm. For the next eight years, she lived alone, looked after by a circle of neighbors and friends. She continued an active correspondence with her editors, fans, and friends during these years.
In the fall of 1956, 89-year-old Wilder became severely ill from undiagnosed diabetes and cardiac issues. She was hospitalized by Lane, who had arrived for Thanksgiving. She was able to return home the day after Christmas. Despite this, her health began to decline after her release from the hospital, and she died at home in her sleep on February 10, 1957: three days after turning 90. She was buried beside Almanzo at Mansfield Cemetery in Mansfield. Lane was buried next to them upon her death in 1968.

===Estate===
Following Wilder&#x27;s death, possession of Rocky Ridge Farm passed to the farmer who had earlier bought the property under a life lease arrangement. The local population put together a non-profit corporation to purchase the house and its grounds for use as a museum. After some wariness at the notion of seeing the house rather than the books be a shrine to Wilder, Lane came to believe that making a museum of it would draw long-lasting attention to the books. She donated the money needed to purchase the house and make it a museum, agreed to make significant contributions each year for its upkeep, and donated many of her parents&#x27; belongings.

In compliance with Wilder&#x27;s will, Lane inherited ownership of the Little House literary estate, with the stipulation that it be for only her lifetime, with all rights reverting to the Mansfield library after her death. Following her death in 1968, however, her chosen heir, as well as her business agent and lawyer Roger MacBride, gained control of the books&#x27; copyrights. The copyrights to each of Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Little House&quot; books, as well as those of Lane&#x27;s own literary works, were renewed in his name after the original copyright had expired.

Controversy arose following MacBride&#x27;s death in 1995, when the Laura Ingalls Wilder Branch of the Wright County Library in Mansfield—the library founded in part by Wilder—tried to recover the rights to the series. The ensuing court case was settled in an undisclosed manner, with MacBride&#x27;s heirs retaining the rights to Wilder&#x27;s books. From the settlement, the library received enough to start work on a new building.

The popularity of the Little House books has grown over the years following Wilder&#x27;s death, spawning a multimillion-dollar franchise of mass merchandising under MacBride&#x27;s impetus. Results of the franchise have included additional spinoff book series—some written by MacBride and his daughter, Abigail—and the long-running television series, starring Melissa Gilbert as Wilder and Michael Landon as her father.

==Political views==
Wilder has been referred to by some as one of America&#x27;s first libertarians. She was a longtime Democrat, but became dismayed with Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal and what she and her daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, saw as Americans&#x27; increasing dependence on the federal government. Wilder grew disenchanted with her party and resented government agents who came to farms like hers and grilled farmers about the number of acres they were planting. Her daughter was similarly a strong libertarian.

Wilder supported women&#x27;s rights (though she worried that women would vote according to what their husbands wanted, and not as they wanted) and education reform. She also became infamous for a short period for shaking the hand of an African American man in segregated Missouri. Indeed, part of the plot of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; involves an African American doctor saving the Ingalls family&#x27;s lives.

== Works ==

Because she died in 1957, Wilder&#x27;s works are now public domain in countries where the term of copyright lasts 50 years after the author&#x27;s death, or less; generally this does not include works first published posthumously. Works first published before 1929 or where copyright was not renewed, primarily her newspaper columns, are also public domain in the United States.

===Wilder Medal===

Wilder was five times a runner-up for the annual Newbery Medal, the premier American Library Association (ALA) book award for children&#x27;s literature. In 1954, the ALA inaugurated a lifetime achievement award for children&#x27;s writers and illustrators, named for Wilder, of which she was the first recipient. The Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal recognizes a living author or illustrator whose books, published in the United States, have made &quot;a substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children&quot;. As of 2013, it has been conferred nineteen times, biennially starting in 2001. In 2018, the award was renamed the Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award in light of language in Wilder&#x27;s works which the Association perceived as biased against Native Americans and African Americans.

<text>Rose Wilder Lane (December 5, 1886 – October 30, 1968) was an American writer and daughter of American writer Laura Ingalls Wilder. Along with two other female writers, Ayn Rand and Isabel Paterson, Lane is one of the more influential advocates of the American libertarian movement.

== Early life ==
Lane was the first child of Laura Ingalls Wilder and Almanzo Wilder and the only child of her parents to survive into adulthood. Her early years were a difficult time for her parents because of successive crop failures, illnesses and chronic economic hardships. During her childhood, the family moved several times, living with relatives in Minnesota and then Florida and briefly returning to De Smet, South Dakota, then settling in Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894. There, her parents eventually established a dairy farm and fruit orchards. She attended secondary school in Mansfield and Crowley, Louisiana while living with her aunt Eliza Jane Wilder, graduating in 1904 in a class of seven. Her intellect and ambition were demonstrated by her ability to compress three years of Latin into one and by graduating at the top of her high school class in Crowley. Despite her academic success, she was unable to attend college as a result of her parents&#x27; financial situation.

== Early career, marriage and divorce ==
After high school graduation, Lane returned to her parents&#x27; home in Mansfield and learned telegraphy at the Mansfield railroad station. Not satisfied with the options open to young women in Mansfield, by early 1905 she was working for Western Union in Sedalia, Missouri. By 1906, Lane was working as a telegrapher at the Midland Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri. Over the next five years, Lane worked as a telegrapher in Missouri, Indiana and California.

In 1908, Lane moved to San Francisco, where she worked as a telegrapher at the Fairmont Hotel. In March 1909, Lane married salesman, promoter and occasional newspaperman Claire Gillette Lane. Evidence suggests the Lanes had met back in Kansas City and Lane&#x27;s diary hints that she moved to San Francisco to join her future husband. Shortly after they wed, Lane quit her job with Western Union and the couple embarked on travels across the United States to promote various schemes. Lane soon became pregnant. While staying in Salt Lake City the following November, Lane gave birth to a premature, stillborn son, according to public records. Subsequent surgery in Kansas City likely left her unable to bear children. The topic is mentioned only briefly in a handful of existing letters written by Lane years after the infant&#x27;s death in order to express sympathy and understanding to close friends who were also dealing with the loss of a child.

For the next few years, the Lanes continued to live a nomadic lifestyle, including stays in Missouri, Ohio, New York and Maine to work together and separately on various promotional and advertising projects. While letters to her parents described a happy-go-lucky existence, Lane&#x27;s subsequent diary entries and numerous autobiographical magazine articles later described her mindset at this time as depressed and disillusioned with her marriage. She felt her intellectual interests did not mesh with the life she was living with her husband. One account even had her attempting suicide by drugging herself with chloroform only to awake with a headache and a renewed sense of purpose in life.

During these years, Lane, keenly aware of her lack of a formal education, read voraciously and taught herself several languages. Her writing career began around 1908, with occasional freelance newspaper jobs that earned much-needed extra cash. In 1913 and 1914, the Lanes sold farmland in what is now the San Jose/Silicon Valley area of Northern California. Conditions often required them to work separately to earn greater commissions and of the two, Lane turned out to be the better salesperson. The marriage floundered as there were several periods of separation and eventually an amicable divorce. Lane&#x27;s diaries reveal subsequent romantic involvements with several men in the years following her divorce, but she never remarried and eventually chose to remain single and free of romantic attachments.

The threat of America&#x27;s entry into World War I had seriously weakened the real estate market, so in early 1915 Lane accepted a friend&#x27;s offer of a stopgap job as an editorial assistant on the staff of the &quot;San Francisco Bulletin&quot;. The stopgap turned into a watershed. She immediately caught the attention of her editors not only through her talents as a writer in her own right, but also as a highly skilled editor for other writers. Before long, her photo and byline were running in the &quot;Bulletin&quot; daily, churning out formulaic romantic fiction serials that ran for weeks at a time. Lane&#x27;s first-hand accounts of the lives of Henry Ford, Charlie Chaplin, Jack London and Herbert Hoover were published in book form.

Later in 1915, Lane&#x27;s mother visited San Francisco for several months. Together they attended the Panama–Pacific International Exposition. Details of this visit and Wilder&#x27;s daily life in 1915 are preserved in Wilder&#x27;s letters to her husband in &quot;West from Home&quot;, published in 1974. Although Lane&#x27;s diaries indicate she was separated from her husband in 1915, her mother&#x27;s letters do not indicate this. Lane and her husband are recorded as living together with him unemployed and looking for work during her mother&#x27;s two-month visit. It seems the separation was either covered up, or had not yet involved separate households.

== Freelance writing career ==
By 1918, Lane&#x27;s marriage officially ended and she had quit her job with the &quot;San Francisco Bulletin&quot; following the resignation of managing editor, Fremont Older. It was at this point that Lane launched her career as a freelance writer. From this period through the early 1940s, her work regularly appeared in leading publications such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. Several of her short stories were nominated for O. Henry Prizes, and a few novels became top sellers.

Lane became the first biographer of Herbert Hoover, writing &quot;The Making of Herbert Hoover&quot; in 1920 in collaboration with Charles K. Field, editor of &quot;Sunset&quot; magazine. The book was published well before Hoover became president in 1929. A friend and defender of Hoover&#x27;s for the remainder of her life, many of her personal papers would later be included in the Rose Wilder-Lane Collection at the Herbert Hoover Library in West Branch, Iowa. While Lane&#x27;s papers contain little actual correspondence between them, the Hoover Post-Presidential Individual series contains a file of Rose&#x27;s correspondence that spans from 1936 to 1963.

In the late 1920s, Lane was reputed to be one of the highest-paid female writers in America and along with Hoover counted among her friends well-known figures such as Sinclair Lewis, Isabel Paterson, Dorothy Thompson, John Patric and Lowell Thomas. Despite this success, her compulsive generosity with her family and friends often found her strapped for cash and forced to work on material that paid well, but thus did not engage her growing interests in political theory and world history. She suffered from periodic bouts of self-doubt and depression in mid-life, diagnosing herself as having bipolar disorder. During these times of depression, Lane was unable to move ahead with her own writing, but she would easily find work as a ghostwriter or silent editor for other well-known writers. In 1928, Lane returned to the United States to live on her parents&#x27; farm. Confident in her sales of her books and short stories as well as her growing stock market investments, she spent freely, building a new home for her parents on the property and modernizing the farmhouse for herself and a steady stream of visiting literary friends.

Lane&#x27;s occasional work as a traveling war correspondent began with a stint with the American Red Cross Publicity Bureau in post-World War I Europe. She continued with the Red Cross through 1965, reporting from Vietnam at the age of 78 for &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; magazine to provide &quot;a woman&#x27;s point of view&quot;. She traveled extensively in Europe and Asia as part of the Red Cross. In 1926, Lane, Helen Dore Boylston and their French maid traveled from France to Albania in a car they had named Zenobia. An account of the journey called &quot;Travels With Zenobia: Paris to Albania by Model T Ford&quot; was published in 1983. Lane became enamored with Albania and lived there for several long periods during the 1920s, spaced between sojourns to Paris and her parents&#x27; Rocky Ridge Farm in Missouri. She informally adopted a young Albanian boy named Rexh Meta (), who she claimed saved her life on a dangerous mountain trek. She later sponsored his education at Cambridge University. He served in the Albanian government and was imprisoned for over thirty years by both the Italian fascists and the Albanian communists, dying in Tirana in 1985.

== Literary collaboration ==
Lane&#x27;s role in her mother&#x27;s &quot;Little House&quot; book series has remained unclear. Her parents had invested with her broker upon her advice and when the market crashed the Wilders found themselves in difficult times. Lane came to the farm at 46 years old, divorced and childless, with minimal finances to keep her afloat.

In late 1930, Lane&#x27;s mother approached her with a rough, first-person narrative manuscript outlining her hardscrabble pioneer childhood, &quot;Pioneer Girl&quot;. Lane took notice and started using her connections in the publishing world. Despite Lane&#x27;s efforts to market &quot;Pioneer Girl&quot; through her publishing connections, the manuscript was rejected time and again. One editor recommended crafting a novel for children out of the beginning. Wilder and Lane worked on the idea and the result was &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot;. Accepted for publishing by Harper and Brothers in late 1931, then hitting the shelves in 1932, the book&#x27;s success resulted in the decision to continue the series, following young Laura into young adulthood. &quot;The First Four Years&quot; was discovered as a manuscript after Lane&#x27;s death in 1968. Wilder had written the manuscript about the first four years of her marriage and the struggles of the frontier, but she never had intended for it to be published. However, in 1971 it became the ninth volume in the &quot;Little House&quot; series.

== Successful novels ==

The collaboration between the two is believed by literary historians to have benefited Lane&#x27;s career as much as her mother&#x27;s. Lane&#x27;s most popular short stories and her two most commercially successful novels were written at this time and were fueled by material which was taken directly from Wilder&#x27;s recollections of Ingalls-Wilder family folklore. &quot;Let the Hurricane Roar&quot; (later titled &quot;Young Pioneers&quot;) and &quot;Free Land&quot; both addressed the difficulties of homesteading in the Dakotas in the late 19th century and how the so-called &quot;free land&quot; in fact cost homesteaders their life savings. &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; paid Lane top fees to serialize both novels, which were later adapted for popular radio performances. Both books represented Lane&#x27;s creative and literary peak. The &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; paid her $30,000 in 1938 to serialize her best-selling novel &quot;Free Land&quot; ($ by today&#x27;s standards). &quot;Let the Hurricane Roar&quot; saw an increasing and steady sale, augmented by its adaptation into popular radio dramatization that starred Helen Hayes.

In 1938, with the proceeds of &quot;Free Land&quot; in hand, Lane was able to pay all of her accumulated debts. She moved to Danbury, Connecticut and purchased a rural home there with three wooded acres, on which she lived for the rest of her life. At this same time, the growing royalties from the &quot;Little House&quot; books were providing Lane&#x27;s parents with an assured and sufficient income. Lane bought her parents an automobile and financed construction of the Rock House near the Wilder homestead. Her parents resided in the Rock House during much of the 1930s.

==Return to journalism and societal views==

During World War II, Lane enjoyed a new phase in her writing career. From 1942 to 1945, she wrote a weekly column for &quot;The Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, at the time the most widely read African-American newspaper.

Rather than hiding or trimming her laissez-faire views, Lane seized the chance to sell them to the readership. She sought out topics of special interest to her audience. Her first entry characterized the Double V campaign as part of the more general fight for individual liberty in the United States, writing: &quot;Here, at last, is a place where I belong. Here are the Americans who know the value of equality and freedom&quot;. Her columns highlighted success stories of blacks to illustrate broader themes about entrepreneurship, freedom and creativity. In one, she compared the accomplishments of Robert Lee Vann and Henry Ford. Vann&#x27;s rags to riches story illustrated the benefits in a &quot;capitalist society in which a penniless orphan, one of a despised minority can create &quot;The Pittsburgh Courier&quot; and publicly, vigorously, safely, attack a majority opinion&quot; while Ford&#x27;s showed how a poor mechanic can create &quot;hundreds of jobs, [...] putting even beggars into cars&quot;.

Lane combined advocacy of laissez faire and anti-racism. The views she expressed on race were similar to those of Zora Neale Hurston, a fellow individualist and writer who was black. Her columns emphasized the arbitrariness of racial categories and stressed the centrality of the individual. Instead of indulging in what she referred to as the &quot;ridiculous, idiotic and tragic fallacy of race, [by] which a minority of the earth&#x27;s population has deluded itself during the past century&quot;, Lane believed it was time for all Americans, black and white, to &quot;renounce their race&quot;. Judging by skin color was comparable to the communists who assigned guilt or virtue on the basis of class. In Lane&#x27;s view, the fallacies of race and class hearkened to the &quot;old English-feudal &#x27;class&#x27; distinction&quot;. She further believed that the collectivists, including those who embraced President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, were to blame for filling &quot;young minds with fantasies of &#x27;races&#x27; and &#x27;classes&#x27; and &#x27;the masses,&#x27; all controlled by pagan gods, named Economic Determinism or Society or Government&quot;.

Along with Hurston and Paterson, Lane was critical of Roosevelt on his foreign policy and was against drafting young men into a foreign war.

== &quot;The Discovery of Freedom&quot; ==
For a few months in 1940, Lane&#x27;s growing zeal for libertarianism united her with the well-known vagabond free-lance writer John Patric, a like-minded political thinker whose advocacy of libertarian themes culminated in his 1943 work &quot;Yankee Hobo in the Orient&quot;. They spent several months traveling across the country in Patric&#x27;s automobile to observe the effects of the Great Depression on the nation and to exchange ideas. The trip culminated in a two-month stay in Bellingham, Washington.

In the early 1940s, despite continuing requests from editors for both fiction and non-fiction material, Lane turned away from commercial fiction writing, save for her collaboration on her mother&#x27;s books. At this time, she became known among libertarians as influential in the movement. She vehemently opposed the New Deal, eschewed &quot;creeping socialism&quot;, Social Security, wartime rationing, and all forms of taxation. Lane ceased writing highly paid commercial fiction to protest paying income taxes. Living on a small salary from her newspaper column and no longer needing to support her parents or adopted sons, she cut expenses to the bare minimum, living a modern-day version of her ancestors&#x27; pioneer life on her rural land near Danbury. She gained some media attention for her refusal to accept a ration card, instead working cooperatively with her rural neighbors to grow and preserve fruits and vegetables and to raise chickens and pigs for meat. Literary critic and political writer Isabel Paterson had urged Lane to move to Connecticut, where she would be only &quot;up country a few miles&quot; from Paterson, who had been a friend for many years.

After experiencing it first hand in the Soviet Union during her travels with the Red Cross, Lane was a staunch opponent of communism. As a result, Lane&#x27;s initial writings on individualism and conservative government began while she was still writing popular fiction in the 1930s, culminating with &quot;The Discovery of Freedom&quot; (1943). After this point, Lane promoted and wrote about individual freedom and its impact on humanity. The same year also saw the publication of Paterson&#x27;s &quot;The God of the Machine&quot; and Ayn Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. Because of these writings, the three women have been referred to as the founding mothers of the American libertarian movement.

Writer Albert Jay Nock wrote that Lane and Paterson&#x27;s nonfiction works were &quot;the only intelligible books on the philosophy of individualism that have been written in America this century&quot;. The two women had &quot;shown the male world of this period how to think fundamentally...[T]hey don&#x27;t fumble and fiddle around – every shot goes straight to the centre&quot;. Journalist John Chamberlain credits Rand, Paterson and Lane with his final &quot;conversion&quot; from socialism to what he called &quot;an older American philosophy&quot; of libertarian and conservative ideas.

In 1943, Lane came into the national spotlight through her response to a radio poll on Social Security. She mailed in a post-card with a response likening the Social Security system to a Ponzi scheme that would, she felt, ultimately destroy the United States. Wartime monitoring of mail eventually resulted in a Connecticut State Trooper being dispatched to her home to question her motives. Her strong response to this infringement on her right of free speech resulted in a flurry of newspaper articles and the publishing of a pamphlet, &quot;What is this, the Gestapo?&quot;, that was meant to remind Americans to be watchful of their rights despite the wartime exigencies. The pamphlet was distributed by the National Economic Council, Inc, an anti-Semitic organization that supported the fascist government in Spain. During this time period, an FBI file was compiled on Lane.

As Lane aged, her political opinions solidified as a stalwart libertarian. Her defense of what she considered to be basic American principles of liberty and freedom were seen by some as harsh and abrasive in the face of disagreement. It is documented that during this time period that she broke with her old friend and political ally Isabel Paterson in 1946. During this time period and into the 1950s, Lane also had an acrimonious correspondence with socialist writer Max Eastman.

== Later years and death ==
Lane played a hands-on role during the 1940s and 1950s in launching the libertarian movement and began an extensive correspondence with figures such as DuPont executive Jasper Crane and writer Frank Meyer as well as her friend and colleague Ayn Rand. She wrote book reviews for the National Economic Council and later for the Volker Fund, out of which grew the Institute for Humane Studies. Later, she lectured at and gave generous financial support to the Freedom School headed by libertarian Robert LeFevre.

With her mother&#x27;s death in 1957, ownership of the Rocky Ridge Farm house reverted to the farmer who had earlier bought the property on a life lease, allowing her to remain in residence. The local population put together a non-profit corporation to purchase the house and its grounds for use as a museum. After some wariness at the notion of seeing the house rather than the books themselves be a shrine to Lane&#x27;s mother, she came to believe that making it into a museum would draw long-lasting attention to the books and sustain the theme of individualism she and her mother wove into the series. She donated the money needed to purchase the house and make it a museum, agreed to make significant contributions each year for its upkeep and also gave many of the family&#x27;s belongings to the group. Lane&#x27;s lifetime inheritance of Wilder&#x27;s growing &quot;Little House&quot; royalties enabled her to again travel extensively and thoroughly renovated and remodeled her Connecticut home. Also during the 1960s, she revived her own commercial writing career by publishing several popular magazine series, including one about her tour of the Vietnam War zone in late 1965.

In later years, Lane wrote a book detailing the history of American needlework for &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot;. She edited and published &quot;On the Way Home&quot;, providing an autobiographical setting around her mother&#x27;s original 1894 diary of their six-week journey from South Dakota to Missouri. Intended to serve as the capstone to the &quot;Little House&quot; series, the book was the result of Wilder&#x27;s fans who were writing to Lane asking &quot;what happened next?&quot;. She contributed book reviews to the William Volker Fund and continued to work on revisions of &quot;The Discovery of Freedom&quot;, which she never completed.

Lane was the adoptive grandmother and mentor to Roger Lea MacBride, later the Libertarian Party&#x27;s 1976 candidate for president. The son of one of her editors with whom she formed a close bond when he was a boy, Lane later stated she was grooming him to be a future Libertarian thought leader. In addition to being her close friend, MacBride became her attorney and business manager and ultimately the heir to the Little House series and the multimillion-dollar franchise that he built around it after her death.

The last of the protégés to be taken under Lane&#x27;s wing was the sister of her Vietnamese interpreter. Impressed by the young girl&#x27;s intelligence, Lane helped to bring her to the United States and sponsored her enrollment in college.

Lane died in her sleep at age 81 on October 30, 1968, just as she was about to depart on a three-year world tour. She was buried next to her parents at Mansfield Cemetery in Mansfield, Missouri.

== In the media ==
Lane was portrayed in the television adaptations of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; by:
* Jennifer and Sarah E. Coleman (seasons 8-9), Jennifer and Michele Steffin (post-series movies) in the &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; TV series
* Terra Allen (part 1) and Skye McCole Bartusiak, Christina Stojanovich (part 2), in the miniseries &quot;Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder&quot;.

There are eight novels written by MacBride, telling of her childhood and early youth. Despite assertions of the accuracy of the locations, dates and people mentioned, there is heavy debate on the degree of authenticity. At least some events may be accurately represented as he was a close friend of hers.

In the novel &quot;Pioneer Girl&quot; by Bich Minh Nguyen, a young Vietnamese-American Lee Lien researches Lane&#x27;s life based on an old family story. Lee&#x27;s grandfather claims that Lane became friendly with the family while visiting Vietnam in 1965 and gifted them with a gold brooch, suspected to be the one Almanzo gave to Laura as described in &quot;These Happy Golden Years.&quot;

In the novel &quot;A Wilder Rose&quot; by Susan Wittig Albert, Lane tells the story of her work on the &quot;Little House&quot; books and her years at the Wilder farm (1928–1935) to Norma Lee Browning, a young friend. The novel is based on Lane&#x27;s diaries and journals of the period and letters exchanged with her mother.

In the alternate history novel &quot;The Probability Broach&quot; by L. Neil Smith in which the United States becomes a libertarian state in 1794 after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason, Lane served as the 21st president of the North American Confederacy from 1940 to 1952.

<text>The Type 212A is a class of diesel-electric attack submarine developed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG (HDW) for the German Navy (German: &quot;U-Boot-Klasse 212 A&quot;), and the Italian Navy where it is known as the Todaro class. It features diesel propulsion and an additional air-independent propulsion (AIP) system using Siemens proton-exchange membrane (PEM) compressed hydrogen fuel cells. The submarines can operate at high speed on diesel power or switch to the AIP system for silent slow cruising, staying submerged for up to three weeks with little exhaust heat. The system is also said to be vibration-free and virtually undetectable.

The Type 212 is the first fuel cell propulsion system equipped submarine series.

==Development==
At the beginning of the 1990s the German Navy was seeking a replacement for the Type 206 submarines. Initial study started on a Type 209 improved design, with AIP capability, called Type 212.

The final programme started in 1994 as the navies of Germany and Italy began working together to design a new conventional submarine, respectively to operate in the shallow and confined waters of the Baltic Sea and in the deeper waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The two different requirements were mixed into a common one and, because of significant updates to the design, the designation has been changed to &quot;Type 212A&quot; since then.

On 22 April 1996 a Memorandum of Understanding gave the start to the cooperation for building four vessels for the German Navy and four vessels for the Italian Navy. Its main aim was the construction of identical boats and the start of a collaboration in logistic and life-cycle support for the two navies.

The German government placed an initial order of four &quot;Type 212A&quot; submarines in 1998. The German Submarine Consortium built them at the shipyards of HDW and Thyssen Nordseewerke GmbH (TNSW) of Emden. Different sections of the submarines were constructed at both sites at the same time and then half of them were shipped to the respective other yard so that both HDW and Thyssen Nordseewerke assembled two complete submarines each.

In the same year the Italian government placed an order of two &quot;U212A&quot; submarines built by Fincantieri for the Italian Navy (&quot;Marina Militare&quot;) at Muggiano shipyard, designated as the Todaro class.

The German Navy ordered two additional, improved submarines in 2006, to be delivered from 2012 on, 1.2 meters longer to give additional space for a new reconnaissance mast.

On 21 April 2008 the Italian Navy ordered the optional second batch of submarine, in the same configuration of the original ones. Some upgrading should involve materials and components of commercial derivation, as well as the software package of the CMS. The intention is to keep the same configuration of the first series and reduce maintenance costs.

The export-oriented Type 214 submarine succeeds the Type 209 submarine and shares certain features with the Type 212A, such as the AIP fuel cell propulsion.

Poland announced in December 2013 they would lease, rather than buy, two U212-A&#x27;s, on account of not meeting &quot;requirements of tactical and technical equipment developed by the military, including in particular the propulsion system, missile weapons and rescue system&quot;.

On 22 December 2015 Admiral Giuseppe De Giorgi, Commander in Chief of the Italian Navy, announced plans to build another two U212A submarines. In December 2022, an amended contract was signed for production of a third NFS Submarine based on the design of the previous two submarines. The third submarine (NFS 3) is planned to be delivered at the end of 2030, while a contract for the fourth boat was anticipated in 2023.

In October 2016, during the celebration of the commissioning of &quot;U36&quot;, the German Navy announced the intent to procure another batch of two U212As within the next decade.

===Type 212CD===
In February 2017, it was announced that the Royal Norwegian Navy would procure four submarines based on the Type 212. Initial plans envisaged service entry between 2025 and 2028, but the Norwegian 2020 Defence Plan later envisaged service entry &quot;around 2030&quot;. This &quot;CD&quot; (Common Design) variant of the Type 212 will consist of six submarines, with the German Navy ordering two new boats alongside the four Norwegian vessels. In March 2021 an agreement was reached between Norway and Germany to initiate the acquisition program, pending approval by the Bundestag. The contract for construction of the six boats was signed in July 2021 with delivery of the first boat to the Royal Norwegian Navy anticipated in 2029.

== Design ==
Partly owing to the &quot;X&quot; arrangement of the stern planes, the &quot;Type 212&quot; is capable of operating in as little as 17 metres of water. This is a long-standing requirement for German submarine designs, enabling them to pass a strategic point in the Baltic Sea (the &quot;Kadettrinne&quot;) submerged. This allows it to come closer to shore than most contemporary submarines. Commandos operating from the boat can surface close to the beach and execute their mission more quickly and with less effort.

The prismatic hull cross-section and smoothly faired transitions from the hull to the sail improve the boat&#x27;s stealth characteristics.

=== Air-independent propulsion ===

Although hydrogen–oxygen propulsion had been considered for submarines as early as World War I, the concept was not very successful until recently due to fire and explosion concerns. In the &quot;Type 212&quot; this has been countered by storing the fuel and oxidizer in tanks outside the crew space, between the pressure hull and outer light hull. The gases are piped through the pressure hull to the fuel cells as needed to generate electricity, but at any given time there is only a very small amount of gas present in the crew space.

In October 2024 it was reported that a new lithium-ion battery system was developed by Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, which will be installed and tested on a existing Type 212A submarine.

=== Weapons ===

The &quot;Type 212A&quot; is capable of launching the fiber optic-guided DM2A4 Seehecht (&quot;Seahake&quot;) heavyweight torpedo, the WASS BlackShark torpedo and short-range missiles from its six torpedo tubes, which use a water ram expulsion system. Future capability may include tube-launched cruise missiles.

The short-range IDAS missile (based on the IRIS-T missile), primarily intended for use against air threats as well as small or medium-sized sea- or near land targets, is currently being developed by Diehl BGT Defence to be fired from Type 212&#x27;s torpedo tubes. IDAS is fiber-optic guided and has a range of approx. 20 km. Four missiles fit in one torpedo tube, stored in a magazine. First deliveries of IDAS for the German Navy were scheduled from 2014 on.

A 30mm auto-cannon called Muräne (moray) to support diver operations or to give warning shots is being considered, too. The cannon, probably a version of the Rheinmetall RMK30, will be stored in a retractable mast and can be fired without the boat surfacing. The mast will also be designed to contain three Aladin UAVs for reconnaissance missions. This mast is likely to be mounted on the second batch of Type 212 submarines for the German Navy.

==Operations==
In April 2006, the German Navy&#x27;s &quot;U-32&quot; sailed from the Baltic Sea to Naval Station Rota in Spain in two weeks, going without surfacing or snorkelling.

The Italian Navy&#x27;s S 526 &quot;Todaro&quot; was deployed, for over six months in 2008, to the United States for CONUS 2008 exercise with the United States Navy.

The Italian Navy&#x27;s S 527 &quot;Scirè&quot; was deployed, for over five months in 2009, to the U.S. for CONUS 2009 exercise with the US Navy.

The Italian Navy&#x27;s S 526 &quot;Todaro&quot;, between 1 September 2012 and 13 February 2013, for the first time was deployed to the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean.

In 2013, while on the way to participate in naval exercises in U.S. waters, the German Navy&#x27;s &quot;U-32&quot; established a new record for non-nuclear submarines with 18 days in submerged transit without snorkelling.

On 15 October 2017, the German Navy&#x27;s &quot;U-35&quot; suffered damage to its rudder fins while conducting dives off the Norwegian coast.

<doc id="195729" wikidata="Q211331" url="?curid=195729" title="Period 3 element">
<text>A period 3 element is one of the chemical elements in the third row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) trends in the chemical behavior of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behavior begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behavior fall into the same vertical columns. The third period contains eight elements: sodium, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine and argon. The first two, sodium and magnesium, are members of the s-block of the periodic table, while the others are members of the p-block. All of the period 3 elements occur in nature and have at least one stable isotope.

== Atomic structure ==
In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the buildup of electrons in the third () shell, more specifically filling its 3s and 3p subshells. There is a 3d subshell, but—in compliance with the Aufbau principle—it is not filled until period 4. This makes all eight elements analogs of the period 2 elements in the same exact sequence. The octet rule generally applies to period 3 in the same way as to period 2 elements, because the 3d subshell is normally non-acting.

== Elements ==
=== Sodium ===

&quot;Sodium&quot; (symbol Na) is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal and is a member of the alkali metals; its only stable isotope is 23Na. It is an abundant element that exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt. Many salts of sodium are highly soluble in water and are thus present in significant quantities in the Earth&#x27;s bodies of water, most abundantly in the oceans as sodium chloride.

Many sodium compounds are useful, such as sodium hydroxide (lye) for soapmaking, and sodium chloride for use as a deicing agent and a nutrient. The same ion is also a component of many minerals, such as sodium nitrate.

The free metal, elemental sodium, does not occur in nature but must be prepared from sodium compounds. Elemental sodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide.

=== Magnesium ===

&quot;Magnesium&quot; (symbol Mg) is an alkaline earth metal and has common oxidation number +2. It is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth&#x27;s crust and the ninth in the known universe as a whole. Magnesium is the fourth most common element in the Earth as a whole (behind iron, oxygen and silicon), making up 13% of the planet&#x27;s mass and a large fraction of the planet&#x27;s mantle. It is relatively abundant because it is easily built up in supernova stars by sequential additions of three helium nuclei to carbon (which in turn is made from three helium nuclei). Due to the magnesium ion&#x27;s high solubility in water, it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater.

The free element (metal) is not found naturally on Earth, as it is highly reactive (though once produced, it is coated in a thin layer of oxide [see passivation], which partly masks this reactivity). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant white light, making it a useful ingredient in flares. The metal is now mainly obtained by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine. Commercially, the chief use for the metal is as an alloying agent to make aluminium-magnesium alloys, sometimes called &quot;magnalium&quot; or &quot;magnelium&quot;. Since magnesium is less dense than aluminium, these alloys are prized for their relative lightness and strength.

Magnesium ions are sour to the taste, and in low concentrations help to impart a natural tartness to fresh mineral waters.

=== Aluminium ===

&quot;Aluminium&quot; (symbol Al) or &quot;aluminum&quot; (American English) is a silvery white member of the boron group of chemical elements and a p-block metal classified by some chemists as a post-transition metal. It is not soluble in water under normal circumstances. Aluminium is the third most abundant element (after oxygen and silicon), and the most abundant metal, in the Earth&#x27;s crust. It makes up about 8% by weight of the Earth&#x27;s solid surface. Aluminium metal is too reactive chemically to occur natively. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different minerals. The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite.

Aluminium is remarkable for the metal&#x27;s low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation. Structural components made from aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and are important in other areas of transportation and structural materials. The most useful compounds of aluminium, at least on a weight basis, are the oxides and sulfates.

=== Silicon ===

&quot;Silicon&quot; (symbol Si) is a group 14 metalloid. It is less reactive than its chemical analog carbon, the nonmetal directly above it in the periodic table, but more reactive than germanium, the metalloid directly below it in the table. Controversy about silicon&#x27;s character dates from its discovery: silicon was first prepared and characterized in pure form in 1824, and given the name silicium (from , flints), with an -ium word-ending to suggest a metal. However, its final name, suggested in 1831, reflects the more chemically similar elements carbon and boron.

Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure free element in nature. It is most widely distributed in dusts, sands, planetoids and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. Over 90% of the Earth&#x27;s crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth&#x27;s crust (about 28% by mass) after oxygen.

Most silicon is used commercially without being separated, and indeed often with little processing of compounds from nature. These include direct industrial building use of clays, silica sand and stone. Silica is used in ceramic brick. Silicate goes into Portland cement for mortar and stucco, and combined with silica sand and gravel, to make concrete. Silicates are also in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain, and in traditional quartz-based soda–lime glass. More modern silicon compounds such as silicon carbide form abrasives and high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the ubiquitous synthetic silicon-based polymers called silicones.

Elemental silicon also has a large impact on the modern world economy. Although most free silicon is used in the steel refining, aluminum-casting, and fine chemical industries (often to make fumed silica), the relatively small portion of very highly purified silicon that is used in semiconductor electronics (&lt; 10%) is perhaps even more critical. Because of wide use of silicon in integrated circuits, the basis of most computers, a great deal of modern technology depends on it.

=== Phosphorus ===

&quot;Phosphorus&quot; (symbol P) is a multivalent nonmetal of the nitrogen group, phosphorus as a mineral is almost always present in its maximally oxidized (pentavalent) state, as inorganic phosphate rocks. Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms—white phosphorus and red phosphorus—but due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth.

The first form of elemental phosphorus to be produced (white phosphorus, in 1669) emits a faint glow upon exposure to oxygen – hence its name given from Greek mythology, meaning &quot;light-bearer&quot; (Latin: &quot;Lucifer&quot;), referring to the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, the planet Venus. Although the term &quot;phosphorescence&quot;, meaning glow after illumination, derives from this property of phosphorus, the glow of phosphorus originates from oxidation of the white (but not red) phosphorus and should be called chemiluminescence. It is also the lightest element to easily produce stable exceptions to the octet rule.

The vast majority of phosphorus compounds are consumed as fertilizers. Other applications include the role of organophosphorus compounds in detergents, pesticides and nerve agents and matches.

=== Sulfur ===

&quot;Sulfur&quot; (symbol S) is an abundant multivalent nonmetal, one of chalcogens. Under normal conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with chemical formula S8. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow crystalline solid when at room temperature. Chemically, sulfur can react as either an oxidant or a reducing agent. It oxidizes most metals and several nonmetals, including carbon, which leads to its negative charge in most organosulfur compounds, but it reduces several strong oxidants, such as oxygen and fluorine.

In nature, sulfur can be found as the pure element and as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Elemental sulfur crystals are commonly sought after by mineral collectors for their brightly colored polyhedron shapes. Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, mentioned for its uses in ancient Greece, China and Egypt. Sulfur fumes were used as fumigants, and sulfur-containing medicinal mixtures were used as balms and antiparasitics. Sulfur is referenced in the Bible as brimstone in English, with this name still used in several nonscientific terms. Sulfur was considered important enough to receive its own alchemical symbol. It was needed to make the best quality of black gunpowder, and the bright yellow powder was hypothesized by alchemists to contain some of the properties of gold, which they sought to synthesize from it. In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was a basic element, rather than a compound.

Elemental sulfur was once extracted from salt domes, where it sometimes occurs in nearly pure form, but this method has been obsolete since the late 20th century. Today, almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum. The element&#x27;s commercial uses are primarily in fertilizers, because of the relatively high requirement of plants for it, and in the manufacture of sulfuric acid, a primary industrial chemical. Other well-known uses for the element are in matches, insecticides and fungicides. Many sulfur compounds are odiferous, and the smell of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, grapefruit, and garlic is due to sulfur compounds. Hydrogen sulfide produced by living organisms imparts the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other biological processes.

=== Chlorine ===

&quot;Chlorine&quot; (symbol Cl) is the second-lightest halogen. The element forms diatomic molecules under standard conditions, called dichlorine. It has the highest electron affinity and the one of highest electronegativity of all the elements; thus chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent.

The most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride (table salt), has been known since ancient times; however, around 1630, chlorine gas was obtained by the Belgian chemist and physician Jan Baptist van Helmont. The synthesis and characterization of elemental chlorine occurred in 1774 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who called it &quot;dephlogisticated muriatic acid air&quot;, as he thought he synthesized the oxide obtained from the hydrochloric acid, because acids were thought at the time to necessarily contain oxygen. A number of chemists, including Claude Berthollet, suggested that Scheele&#x27;s &quot;dephlogisticated muriatic acid air&quot; must be a combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, and Scheele named the supposed new element within this oxide as &quot;muriaticum&quot;. The suggestion that this newly discovered gas was a simple element was made in 1809 by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques. This was confirmed in 1810 by Sir Humphry Davy, who named it chlorine, from the Greek word &quot;χλωρός&quot; (chlōros), meaning &quot;green-yellow&quot;.

Chlorine is a component of many other compounds. It is the second most abundant halogen and 21st most abundant element in Earth&#x27;s crust. The great oxidizing power of chlorine led it to its bleaching and disinfectant uses, as well as being an essential reagent in the chemical industry. As a common disinfectant, chlorine compounds are used in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion.

=== Argon ===

&quot;Argon&quot; (symbol Ar) is the third element in group 18, the noble gases. Argon is the third most common gas in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, at 0.93%, making it more common than carbon dioxide. Nearly all of this argon is radiogenic argon-40 derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth&#x27;s crust. In the universe, argon-36 is by far the most common argon isotope, being the preferred argon isotope produced by stellar nucleosynthesis.

The name &quot;argon&quot; is derived from the Greek neuter adjective &quot;ἀργόν&quot;, meaning &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;the inactive one&quot;, as the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions. The complete octet (eight electrons) in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements. Its triple point temperature of 83.8058 K is a defining fixed point in the International Temperature Scale of 1990.

Argon is produced industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive: for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon gas also has uses in incandescent and fluorescent lighting, and other types of gas discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue–green gas laser.

== Biological roles ==

Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants. In animals, sodium ions are used against potassium ions to build up charges on cell membranes, allowing transmission of nerve impulses when the charge is dissipated; it is therefore classified as a dietary inorganic macromineral.

Magnesium is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the human body; its ions are essential to all living cells, where they play a major role in manipulating important biological polyphosphate compounds like ATP, DNA, and RNA. Hundreds of enzymes thus require magnesium ions to function. Magnesium is also the metallic ion at the center of chlorophyll, and is thus a common additive to fertilizers. Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives, antacids (e.g., milk of magnesia), and in a number of situations where stabilization of abnormal nerve excitation and blood vessel spasm is required (e.g., to treat eclampsia).

Despite its prevalence in the environment, aluminium salts are not known to be used by any form of life. In keeping with its pervasiveness, it is well tolerated by plants and animals. Because of their prevalence, potential beneficial (or otherwise) biological roles of aluminium compounds are of continuing interest.

Silicon is an essential element in biology, although only tiny traces of it appear to be required by animals, though various sea sponges need silicon in order to have structure. It is much more important to the metabolism of plants, particularly many grasses, and silicic acid (a type of silica) forms the basis of the striking array of protective shells of the microscopic diatoms.

Phosphorus is essential for life. As phosphate, it is a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and also the phospholipids that form all cell membranes. Demonstrating the link between phosphorus and life, elemental phosphorus was historically first isolated from human urine, and bone ash was an important early phosphate source. Phosphate minerals are fossils. Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in some aquatic systems. Today, the most important commercial use of phosphorus-based chemicals is the production of fertilizers, to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil.

Sulfur is an essential element for all life, and is widely used in biochemical processes. In metabolic reactions, sulfur compounds serve as both fuels and respiratory (oxygen-replacing) materials for simple organisms. Sulfur in organic form is present in the vitamins biotin and thiamine, the latter being named for the Greek word for sulfur. Sulfur is an important part of many enzymes and in antioxidant molecules like glutathione and thioredoxin. Organically bonded sulfur is a component of all proteins, as the amino acids cysteine and methionine. Disulfide bonds are largely responsible for the mechanical strength and insolubility of the protein keratin, found in outer skin, hair, and feathers, and the element contributes to their pungent odor when burned.

Elemental chlorine is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all lifeforms, and is used as a pulmonary agent in chemical warfare; however, chlorine is necessary to most forms of life, including humans, in the form of chloride ions.

Argon has no biological role. Like any gas besides oxygen, argon is an asphyxiant.

<text>François Joseph Westermann (5 September 17515 April 1794) was a French revolutionary and military leader during the French Revolution. He is best known as one of the main French Republican commanders in the initial stage of the War in the Vendée. 

==Early career==
Westermann was born on 5 September 1751 in Molsheim, Alsace (today department of Bas-Rhin). He enlisted in Count Esterhazy&#x27;s regiment of hussars in 1767, retiring six years later as a non-commissioned officer. In 1788, he was briefly employed at the Count of Artois&#x27; stables in Paris, then returned to Alsace to work in the city government of Strasbourg. Westermann was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution, and in 1790 became &quot;greffier&quot; of the municipality of Haguenau. After a short imprisonment on a charge of inciting riots in Haguenau, Westermann moved to Paris in May 1792, where he became an ally of revolutionary leader Georges Danton.

Westermann played an leading role in the overthrow of the French monarchy on 10 August 1792, where he commanded a unit of &quot;fédérés&quot; in the attack on the Tuileries Palace. Afterwards, Westermann rejoined the army and accompanied General Charles François Dumouriez on his campaigns with the Army of the North and the Army of the Ardennes, and assisted him in his negotiations with the Duke of Brunswick. He served under Dumouriez in the invasion of the Netherlands, most notably at the Siege of Breda (21–27 February 1793), but was arrested as an accomplice after the general&#x27;s defection in April 1793. Denounced by Jean-Paul Marat to the National Convention, Westermann succeeded in proving his innocence, and was sent with the rank of general of brigade to quell the Revolt in the Vendée.

==War in the Vendée==
Westermann distinguished himself by his extraordinary courage, daring maneuvers, and severe treatment of the insurgents. Appointed commander of the vanguard of the Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle on 18 May 1793, he defeated the rebels at Parthenay on 20 June, then captured Châtillon on 3 July. After suffering a defeat at the First Battle of Châtillon, Westermann was suspended and brought before the National Convention, only recovering his command on 29 August.

After serving in the Second Battle of Châtillon, Westermann received a command in the Army of the West. Beaten at the battles of Croix-Bataille and Entrames, he defeated the Vendéens at Beaupréau, Granville, and in December 1793 annihilated the Catholic and Royal Army at the Battle of Le Mans and the Battle of Savenay.

In a controversial document, the authenticity of which is disputed, Westermann supposedly wrote to the Committee of Public Safety:
:&quot;There is no more Vendée, Republican citizens. It died beneath our free sword, with its women and its children. I have just buried it in the swamps and the woods of Savenay. Following the orders that you gave to me, I crushed the children beneath the horses&#x27; hooves, massacred the women who, those at least, will bear no more brigands. I do not have a single prisoner to reproach myself with. I have exterminated them all...&quot;

Some historians believe this letter never existed. The rebellion was still going on, and there were several thousand living Vendéan prisoners being held by Westermann&#x27;s forces when the letter was supposedly written. The killing of civilians would also have been an explicit violation of the Convention&#x27;s orders to Westermann.

After his victory, in January 1794 Westermann was summoned to Paris, where, as a friend and partisan of Danton, he was proscribed and sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal. He was guillotined along with the Dantonist party on 5 April 1794.

He is depicted by Jacques Villeret in the 1983 film &quot;Danton&quot; and by Eduard von Winterstein in the 1921 movie of the same name.

<doc id="195734" wikidata="Q333877" url="?curid=195734" title="Pecan">
<text>The pecan ( , , ; &quot;Carya illinoinensis&quot;) is a species of hickory native to the Southern United States and northern Mexico in the region of the Mississippi River. 

The tree is cultivated for its seed primarily in the U.S. states of Georgia, New Mexico, and Texas, and in Mexico. The seed is an edible nut used as a snack and in various recipes, such as praline candy and pecan pie. The pecan is the state nut of Alabama, Arkansas, California, Texas, and Louisiana, and is also the state tree of Texas.

==Name==
 derives from an Algonquian word variously referring to pecans, walnuts, and hickory nuts. There are many pronunciations, some regional and others not. There is little agreement in the United States regarding the &quot;correct&quot; pronunciation, even regionally. 

In 1927, the National Pecan Growers Association acknowledged variant pronunciations while designating one as official and correct: &quot;pronounced as though spelled pea-con ... those in the habit of using any other pronunciation therefore be requested henceforth to adopt exclusively the pronunciation above specified above and hereby adopted by the Association.&quot;

== Description ==
The pecan tree is a large deciduous tree, growing to in height, rarely to . It typically has a spread of with a trunk up to diameter. A 10-year-old sapling grown in optimal conditions will stand about tall. The leaves are alternate, long, and pinnate with 9–17 leaflets, each leaflet long and broad.

A pecan, like the fruit of all other members of the hickory genus, is not truly a nut, but is technically a drupe, a fruit with a single stone or pit, surrounded by a husk. The husks are produced from the exocarp tissue of the flower, while the part known as the nut develops from the endocarp and contains the seed. The husk itself is aeneous, that is, brassy greenish-gold in color, oval to oblong in shape, long, and broad. The outer husk is thick, starts out green, and turns brown at maturity, at which time it splits off in four sections to release the thin-shelled seed.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Carya illinoinensis&quot;, is a member of the Juglandaceae family. Juglandaceae are represented worldwide by seven and ten extant genera and more than 60 species. Most of these species are concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere of the New World, but some can be found on every continent except Antarctica. 

=== Phylogeny ===
The first fossil examples of Juglandaceae appear during the Cretaceous. Differentiation between the subfamilies of Engelhardioideae and Juglandioideae occurred during the early Paleogene, about 64 million years ago. Extant examples of Engelhardioideae are generally tropical and evergreen, while those of Juglandioideae are deciduous and found in more temperate zones. 

The second major step in the development of pecan was a change from wind-dispersed fruits to animal dispersion. This dispersal strategy coincides with developing a husk around the fruit and a drastic change in the relative concentrations of fatty acids. The ratio of oleic to linoleic acids is inverted between wind- and animal-dispersed seeds. Further differentiation from other species of Juglandaceae occurred about 44 million years ago during the Eocene. The fruits of the pecan genus &quot;Carya&quot; differ from those of the walnut genus &quot;Juglans&quot; only in the formation of the husk of the fruit. The husks of walnuts develop from the bracts, bracteoles and sepals, or sepals only. The husks of pecans develop from the bracts and the bracteoles only.

== Cultivation ==
Pecans are one of the most recently domesticated of the major crops. Although wild pecans were well known among native and colonial Americans as a delicacy, the commercial growth of pecans in the United States did not begin until the 1880s. As of 2014, the United States produced an annual crop of , with 75% of the total crop produced in Georgia, New Mexico, and Texas. They can be grown from USDA hardiness zones approximately 5 to 9, and grow best where summers are long, hot and humid. The nut harvest for growers is typically around mid-October. 

In 2017, outside the U.S., Mexico produced nearly half of the world&#x27;s total, similar in volume to that of the U.S., together accounting for 93% of global production. As of 2024, South Africa is the third largest producer, mostly exporting to China. Pecan trees require large quantities of water during the growing
season, and most orchards in the region use flood irrigation to optimize consumptive water use and production of mature pecans. Generally, two or more trees of different cultivars must be present to pollinate each other.

 Choosing cultivars can be a complex practice, based on the Alternate Bearing Index (ABI) and their period of pollinating. Commercial growers are most concerned with the ABI, which describes a cultivar&#x27;s likelihood to bear on alternating years (index of 1.0 signifies the highest likelihood of bearing little to nothing every other year). The period of pollination groups all cultivars into two families: those that shed pollen before they can receive pollen (protandrous) and those that shed pollen after becoming receptive to pollen (protogynous). State-level resources provide recommended varieties for specific regions.

Native pecans in Mexico are adapted from zones 9 to 11. Little or no breeding work has been done with these populations. A few selections from native stands have been made, such as Frutosa and Norteña, which are recommended for cultivation in Mexico. Improved varieties recommended for cultivation in Mexico are USDA-developed cultivars. This represents a gap in breeding development given that native pecans can be cultivated at least down to the Yucatán peninsula while the USDA cultivars have chilling hour requirements greater than those occurring in much of the region. Some regions of the U.S. such as parts of Florida and Puerto Rico are zone 10 or higher, and these regions have limited options for pecan cultivation. &#x27;Western&#x27; is the only commonly available variety that can make a crop in low-chill zones.

=== Breeding and selection programs ===
 Active breeding and selection is carried out by the USDA Agricultural Research Service with growing locations at Brownwood and College Station, Texas. University of Georgia has a breeding program at the Tifton campus working on selecting pecan varieties adapted to subtropical Southeastern U.S. growing conditions.

While selection work has been done since the late 19th century, most acreage of pecans grown today is of older cultivars, such as &#x27;Stuart&#x27;, &#x27;Schley&#x27;, &#x27;Elliott&#x27;, and &#x27;Desirable&#x27;, with known flaws, but also with known production potential. Cultivars such as &#x27;Elliot&#x27; are increasing in popularity due to resistance to pecan scab. The long cycle time for pecan trees plus financial considerations dictate that new varieties go through an extensive vetting process before being widely planted. Numerous varieties produce well in Texas, but fail in the Southeastern U.S. due to increased disease pressure. Selection programs are ongoing at the state level, with Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico, and others having trial plantings.

Varieties adapted from the southern tier of states north through some parts of Iowa and even into southern Canada are available from nurseries. Production potential drops significantly when planted further north than Tennessee. Most breeding efforts for northern-adapted varieties have not been on a large enough scale to significantly affect production. Varieties that are available and adapted (e.g., &#x27;Major&#x27;, &#x27;Martzahn&#x27;, &#x27;Witte&#x27;, &#x27;Greenriver&#x27;, &#x27;Mullahy&#x27;, and &#x27;Posey&#x27;) in zones 6 and farther north are almost entirely selections from wild stands. &#x27;Kanza&#x27;, a northern-adapted release from the USDA breeding program, is a grafted pecan having high productivity and quality, and cold tolerance.

=== Diseases, pests, and disorders ===

Pecans are subject to various diseases, pests, and physiological disorders that can limit tree growth and fruit production. These range from scab to hickory shuckworm to shuck decline.

Pecans are prone to infection by bacteria and fungi such as pecan scab, especially in humid conditions. Scab is the most destructive disease affecting pecan trees untreated with fungicides. Recommendations for preventive spray materials and schedules are available from state-level resources.

Various insects feed on the leaves, stems, and developing nuts. These include ambrosia beetles, twig girdlers, pecan nut casebearer, hickory shuckworm, phylloxera, curculio, weevils, and several aphid species.

In the Southeastern U.S., nickel deficiency in &quot;C. illinoinensis&quot; produces a disorder called &quot;mouse-ear&quot; in trees fertilized with urea. Similarly, zinc deficiency causes rosetting of the leaves. Various other disorders are documented, including canker disease and shuck decline complex.

==Uses==
Pecan seeds are edible, with a rich, buttery flavor. They can be eaten fresh or roasted, or used in cooking, particularly in sweet desserts, such as pecan pie, a traditional Southern U.S. dish. Butter pecan is also a common flavor in cookies, cakes, and ice creams. Pecans are a significant ingredient in American praline candy. Other applications of cooking with pecans include pecan oil and pecan butter.

Pecan wood is used in making furniture and wood flooring, as well as flavoring fuel for smoking meats, giving grilled foods a sweet and nutty flavor stronger than many fruit woods.

=== Nutrition ===
A pecan nut is 4% water, 72% fat, 9% protein, and 14% carbohydrates. In a 100 g reference amount, pecans provide 690 calories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber (38% DV), manganese (214% DV), magnesium (34% DV), phosphorus (40% DV), zinc (48% DV), and thiamine (57% DV). Pecans are a moderate source (10–19% DV) of iron and B vitamins. Pecan fat content consists principally of monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly oleic acid (57% of total fat), and the polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (30% of total fat).

== History ==
Before European settlement, pecans were widely consumed and traded by Native Americans. As a wild forage, the fruit of the previous growing season is commonly still edible when found on the ground. Native American tribes would collect the fruit to make flour that was used as a meat substitute and a milky fermented drink called &quot;Pow-cohicora&quot;, along with the bark and leaves made into a tea to heal ailments such as Tuberculosis.

Pecans first became known to Europeans in the 16th century. The first Europeans to come into contact with pecans were Spanish explorers in what is now Louisiana, Texas, and Mexico.These Spanish explorers called the pecan, &quot;nuez de la arruga&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;wrinkle nut&quot;. Because of their familiarity with the genus &quot;Juglans&quot;, these early explorers referred to the nuts as &quot;nogales&quot; and &quot;nueces&quot;, the Spanish terms for &quot;walnut trees&quot; and &quot;fruit of the walnut&quot;. They noted the particularly thin shell and acorn-like shape of the fruit, indicating they were referring to pecans. The Spaniards took the pecan into Europe, Asia, and Africa in the 16th century. 

In 1792, William Bartram reported in his botanical book, &quot;Travels&quot;, a nut tree, &quot;Juglans exalata&quot; that some botanists today argue was the American pecan tree. Still, others argue hickory, &quot;Carya ovata&quot;. Pecan trees are native to the United States, and writing about the pecan tree goes back to the nation&#x27;s founders. Thomas Jefferson planted pecan trees, &quot;C. illinoinensis&quot; (Illinois nuts), in his nut orchard at his home, Monticello, in Virginia. George Washington reported in his journal that Thomas Jefferson gave him &quot;Illinois nuts&quot;, pecans, which Washington then grew at Mount Vernon, his Virginia home.

Commercial production of pecans was slow because trees were slow to mature and bear fruit. More importantly, the trees grown from the nuts of one tree have very diverse characters. To speed nut production and retain the best tree characteristics, grafting from mature, productive trees was the apparent strategy. However, this proved technically challenging. The &quot;Centennial&quot; cultivar was the first to be successfully grafted. This was accomplished by an enslaved person called Antoine in 1846 or 1847, who was owned by Jacques Telesphore Roman of the Oak Alley Plantation near the Mississippi River. The scions were supplied by Dr. A. E. Colomb, who had unsuccessfully attempted to graft them.

==Genetics==
Pecan is a 32-chromosome species (1N = 16) that readily hybridizes with other 32-chromosome members of the &quot;Carya&quot; genus, such as &quot;Carya ovata&quot;, &quot;Carya laciniosa&quot;, &quot;Carya cordiformis&quot; and has been reported to hybridize with 64-chromosome species such as &quot;Carya tomentosa&quot;. Most such hybrids are unproductive. Hybrids are referred to as &quot;hicans&quot; to indicate their hybrid origin. Recent efforts at NMSU to complete a pecan genome showed that DNA introgressed from &quot;C. aquatica&quot; (water hickory), &quot;C. myristiciformis&quot; (nutmeg hickory), and &quot;C. cordiformis&quot; (bitternut hickory) is present in commercial pecan varieties grown today. 

== In culture ==
In 1919, the 36th Texas Legislature made the pecan tree the state tree of Texas; in 2001, the pecan was declared the state&#x27;s official &quot;health nut&quot;, and in 2013, pecan pie was made the state&#x27;s official pie. The town of San Saba, Texas claims to be &quot;The Pecan Capital of the World&quot; and is the site of the &quot;Mother Tree&quot; () considered to be the source of the state&#x27;s production through its progeny. 

Alabama named the pecan the official state nut in 1982. Arkansas adopted it as the official nut in 2009. California adopted it, along with the almond, pistachio, and walnut, as one of four state nuts in 2017. Louisiana, known for pralines, adopted the Pecan as its official state nut in 2023. In 1988, Oklahoma enacted an official state meal which included pecan pie.
