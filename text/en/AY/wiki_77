<text>Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm (26 September 172319 December 1807) was a German-born French-language journalist, art critic, diplomat and contributor to the &quot;Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers&quot;. In 1765 Grimm wrote &quot;Poème lyrique&quot;, an influential article for the Encyclopédie on lyric and opera librettos. Like Christoph Willibald Gluck and Ranieri de&#x27; Calzabigi, Grimm became interested in opera reform. According to , a German literary theorist, &quot;sooner or later a book entitled &quot;The Aesthetic Ideas of Grimm&quot; will have to be written.&quot;

== Early years ==

Grimm was born at Regensburg, the son of Johann Melchior Grimm (1682–1749), a pastor, and Sibylle Margarete Grimm, (&quot;née&quot; Koch) (1684–1774). He studied at the University of Leipzig, where he came under the influence of Johann Christoph Gottsched and of Johann August Ernesti, to whom he was largely indebted for his critical appreciation of classical literature. When nineteen, he produced a tragedy, &quot;Banise&quot;, which met with some success. After two years of studying literature and philosophy, he returned to his hometown, where he was attached to the household of Count Schönborn. In 1749, he accompanied his pupil, the young Schönborn, to Paris. There, appointed him as his secretary. Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote in his &quot;Confessions&quot; that Grimm played a cembalo and acted also as reader to the eldest son of Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, the young hereditary prince of Saxe-Gotha.

His acquaintance with Rousseau soon ripened into warm friendship, through a mutual sympathy in regard to music and theater, and led to a close association with the Encyclopaedists Diderot, Baron d&#x27;Holbach, d&#x27;Alembert, Marmontel, Morellet and Helvétius, who were meeting at the salon of Marie-Charlotte Hippolyte de Campet de Saujon. He rapidly obtained a thorough knowledge of the French language and acquired so perfectly the tone and sentiments of the society in which he moved that all marks of his foreign origin and training seemed effaced. In 1750, he started to write for the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; on German literature and the ideas of Gottsched. In 1752, at the beginning of the &quot;Querelle des Bouffons&quot;, he wrote &quot;Lettre de M. Grimm sur Omphale&quot;. Grimm complained that the text of the libretto had no connection with the music. Grimm and Rousseau became the enemy of Élie Catherine Fréron. In 1753, he wrote a witty pamphlet entitled &quot;Le petit prophète de Boehmischbroda&quot;, &quot;a parable about a Bohemian boy being sent to Paris to see the lamentable state into which the French opera has descended&quot;. This defence of Italian opera established his literary reputation. It is possible that the origin of the pamphlet is partly to be accounted for by his vehement passion for Marie Fel, the &quot;prima donna&quot; of the Paris Opéra, who was one of the few French singers capable of performing Italian arias. When she refused him (and stayed in relation with Louis de Cahusac), Grimm fell into lethargy. Rousseau and abbé Raynal took care of him.


In 1753, following the example of the abbé Raynal, and with the latter&#x27;s encouragement, Grimm began a literary newsletter with various German sovereigns. The first number of the &#x27; was dated 15 May 1753. With the aid of friends, especially of Diderot and Mme. d&#x27;Épinay, who reviewed many plays, always anonymously, during his temporary absences from France, Grimm himself carried on the &#x27;, which consisted of two letters a month that were painstakingly copied in manuscript by amanuenses safely apart from the French censor in Zweibrücken, just over the border in the Palatinate.

Eventually, Grimm counted among his 16 (or 25) subscribers: Princess Luise Dorothea of Saxe-Meiningen, Princess Caroline Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, Henry of Prussia, Catherine II of Russia, Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, Gustav III of Sweden, and many princes of the smaller German states, as Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden, Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, William Henry, Prince of Nassau-Saarbrücken, and Frederick Michael, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken. Between 1763 and 1766, Grimm attempted to recruit Frederick the Great as a subscriber. Mme Geoffrin, whose Paris salon Grimm frequented, enrolled Stanislas Poniatowski as a subscriber, writing him: &quot;Here is your first number, together with Grimm&#x27;s accompanying letter. Your Majesty will see that it is important that no copies be made. The German courts are very loyal to Grimm in this particular. I may even say to Your Majesty that negligence on this point could have serious consequences for me, the matter having passed through my hands.&quot;

The correspondence of Grimm was strictly confidential and was not divulged during his lifetime. It embraces nearly the whole period from 1750 to 1790, but the later volumes, 1773 to 1790, were chiefly the work of his secretary, the Swiss , with whom he made acquaintance in the salon of Suzanne Curchod, the wife of Jacques Necker. At first he contented himself with enumerating the chief current views in literature and art and indicating very slightly the contents of the principal new books, but gradually his criticisms became more extended and trenchant, and he touched on nearly every subject — political, literary, artistic, social and religious — that interested the Parisian society of the time. His notices of contemporaries are somewhat severe, and he exhibits the foibles and selfishness of the society in which he moved; but he was unbiased in his literary judgments, and time has only served to confirm his criticisms. In style and manner of expression, he is thoroughly French. He is generally somewhat cold in his appreciation, but his literary taste is delicate and subtle, and it was the opinion of Sainte-Beuve that the quality of his thought in his best moments will compare not unfavourably even with that of Voltaire. His religious and philosophical opinions were entirely sceptical.

== Content of the &quot; ==
For several years, Grimm reported on the painters and paintings in the Salon de Paris, and was successfully succeeded by Diderot; he appreciated the architects Jacques-Germain Soufflot, and Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, the naturalist and mathematician Buffon, the mathematician Leonhard Euler, and the political scientist Condorcet. Grimm asked Diderot to review &quot;Voyage autour du monde&quot; (&quot;A Voyage Round the World&quot;) by Louis Antoine de Bougainville. Grimm had paid attention to the case Jean Calas, the problems between Rousseau and David Hume, the Montgolfier brothers, and Madame de Staël when she published her &quot;Letters on the works and character of J.J. Rousseau&quot;. The &quot;&quot; became one of the influential media to spread malicious and false information on Rousseau.

Grimm did not appreciate Mondonville&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis et Alcimadure&quot;, though he approved the use of the Occitan language, as being closer to Italian; according to Grimm &quot;In Zoroastre it is day and night alternately but as the poet ... cannot count up to five he has got so muddled in his reckoning that he has been compelled to make it be day and night two or three times in each act so that it might be day at the end of the play&quot;. He wrote about Caffarelli; about Pierre Beaumarchais. Grimm didn&#x27;t think much of Antoine de Léris: &quot;The author claims that the public received his work with indulgence. If perfect oblivion may so be called, the author is right to be grateful&quot;; The diminished &#x27; continued without Grimm until the revolutionary year 1790.

== Connections ==
In 1755, after the death of Count von Friesen (1727–1755), who was a nephew of Marshal Maurice de Saxe and an officer in the French army, Grimm secured a sinecure worth 2000 &quot;livres&quot; a year as &quot;secrétaire des commandements&quot; to Marshal d&#x27;Estrées on the Westphalia campaign of 1756–57 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1759, he was named envoy of the town of Frankfurt am Main to the French court, but was deprived of his office for criticizing the comte de Broglie in a dispatch intercepted by Louis XV&#x27;s secret service.

=== Rousseau ===
In 1751, Grimm was introduced by Rousseau to Madame d&#x27;Épinay, with whom he began a 30-year liaison two years later, which led after four years to an irreconcilable rupture between him, Diderot and Rousseau.

Grimm and d&#x27;Holbach supported financially the mother of Thérèse Levasseur. Instead of Rousseau, Grimm accompanied Mme. d&#x27;Épinay to Geneva to visit doctor Théodore Tronchin. Rousseau believed Grimm had made her pregnant.

Grimm criticized Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Julie, or the New Heloise&quot; and &quot;Emile, or On Education&quot;. Rousseau was induced by his resentment to give in his &quot;Confessions&quot; a malicious portrait of Grimm&#x27;s character. Grimm&#x27;s betrayals of his closest friend, Diderot, finally led Diderot to bitter denunciations of him too in his &quot;Lettre apologétique de l&#x27;abbé Raynal à M. Grimm&quot; in 1781.

In 1783, Grimm lost Mme. Épinay, his most intimate friend, and the following year Diderot.

Not long after, he showed Prince Henry of Prussia, on a diplomatic trip, in Paris.

=== Mozart&#x27;s three visits to Paris ===
Leopold Mozart decided to take his two child prodigies, the seven-year-old boy, Wolfgang (born 27 January 1756), and the 12-year-old girl, Nannerl (Maria Anna, born 30 July 1751), on their &quot;Grand Tour&quot; in June 1763. Mozart&#x27;s first visit to Paris lasted from 18 November 1763 to 10 April 1764, when the family departed for London. All the many letters of recommendation carried by Leopold proved ineffectual, except the one to Melchior Grimm, which led to an effective connection. Grimm was a German who had moved to Paris at age 25 and was an advanced amateur of music and opera, which he covered as a Paris-based journalist for the aristocracy of Europe. He was persuaded &quot;to take the German prodigies under his wing.&quot; Grimm published a highly supportive article on the Mozart children in his &quot;Correspondance littéraire&quot; of December 1763, to facilitate Leopold&#x27;s entrée into Parisian high society and musical circles.

Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, the son of Grimm&#x27;s employer, helped the Mozarts perform in Versailles, where they stayed for two weeks over Christmas and New Year. Hermann Abert explains that &quot;only when they had performed at Versailles were they admitted to, and admired by, aristocratic circles.&quot; Grimm recounted with pride the impressive improvisations produced by young Mozart in private and public concerts. Leopold had four of his sonatas for keyboard and violin engraved and dedicated to King Louis XV&#x27;s daughter, &quot;Madame Victoire&quot;, and the Dauphine&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, by &quot;THEOPH:W:MOZART Compositeur, et Maitre de Musique, agé de 7 ans&quot;. In 1766, Carmontelle produced a group portrait of the family performing, engraved at Grimm&#x27;s instigation. In 1777, Michel-Barthélémy Ollivier painted Wolfgang playing the pianoforte in the Prince of Conti&#x27;s salon at the Temple, a painting now in the Louvre Museum.

After their long stay in London (15 months) and Holland (8 months), the Mozarts closed their &quot;Grand Tour&quot;, which lasted three years and a half, by stopping over in Paris from 10 May to 9 July 1766, for Mozart&#x27;s second visit to the French capital. Again, they were helped, guided, and mentored by Grimm. The children were by then 10 and 15 and had lost some of their public appeal as young prodigies on the now somewhat &quot;blasés&quot; Parisians. Grimm wrote a very flattering letter about the Mozart children dated 15 July 1766 in his &quot;Correspondance littéraire&quot;. Commenting on Mozart&#x27;s remarkable progress in all areas of music-making, Grimm predicted the future operatic success of the young composer: &quot;He has even written several Italian arias, and I have little doubt that before he has reached the age of twelve, he will already have had an opera performed at some Italian theatre.&quot;

However, Abert warns that the reason why Grimm&#x27;s Journal &quot;nonetheless needs to be treated with caution is due to the personality of its principal contributor, for Grimm was not sufficiently well trained as a musician to do justice to the art that he was describing, nor was he the man to let slip the opportunity for a flash of wit or eloquent turn of phrase, even if it meant violating the truth in the process.&quot; Grimm&#x27;s second prediction at the end of the same letter didn&#x27;t turn out as prescient as the first one: &quot;If these children live, they will not remain at Salzburg. Before long monarchs will vie for their possession.&quot; In fact, Mozart was unable to obtain employment as an opera composer from a European court and remained a free-lance opera writer all his life.

Leopold sent Mozart, then aged 22, to Paris for his third and last visit, from 23 March to 26 September 1778. But this time Mozart went only with his mother, Anna Maria Mozart, while Leopold remained in Salzburg, in order to save his employment. Grimm helped, guided, and advised Mozart and his mother again, acting as a proud manager. But Mozart mostly encountered a series of disappointments, while tragedy struck when Anna Maria fell ill with typhoid fever and died on 3 July 1778. After the death of his mother, Mozart moved in with Grimm who was living with Mme d&#x27;Épinay, at 5, rue de la Chaussée-d&#x27;Antin. For the first time in his life, Mozart was on his own. Mozart stayed more than two months in pretty little room for invalids with a very agreeable prospect, which belonged to Louise d&#x27;Épinay; he sometimes dined with them but most of the time he was out.

Grimm, a man with strong opinions, nicknamed &quot;Tyran le Blanc&quot;, and Mozart did not get along very well. Mozart found himself disappointed in Paris. The city was &quot;indescribably dirty&quot;; Grimm complained he was &quot;not running around enough&quot; to get pupils, as he found that calling on his introductions was tiring, too expensive, and unproductive: &quot;People pay their respects, and that&#x27;s it. They arrange for me to come on such and such a day; I then play for them, and they say &quot;Oh, c&#x27;est un prodige, c&#x27;est inconcevable, c&#x27;est étonnant.&quot; And, with that, &quot;adieu&quot;.&quot; He never got paid for his &quot;Concerto for flute and harp in C&quot;, K. 299, written for the Duke of Guines and his daughter, nor for his ballet &quot;Les petits riens&quot; K. 299b.

Mozart was recruited by the director of the &quot;Concert Spirituel&quot;, Joseph Legros, to write some choruses, K. 297a, which were played without giving credit to Mozart. Then Mozart wrote a &quot;Sinfonia concertante in E flat major&quot; K. 297b, for a group of four wind players from Mannheim, which he sold to Legros without keeping a copy. Legros never had it copied for performance, and the work became considered &quot;lost&quot;. Mozart at last enjoyed one great success at the &quot;Concert Spirituel&quot; as a composer with his &quot;Symphony No. 31 in D&quot;, K. 297 (&quot;Paris Symphony&quot;), performed on 18 June 1778 &quot;to unanimous acclaim&quot;.
Mozart kept finding Paris &quot;totally at odds&quot; with his &quot;genius, inclinations, knowledge, and sympathies&quot;. He kept expressing his deep dislike of the French, their character, their rudeness, their being &quot;frightfully arrogant&quot;, and he was &quot;appalled by their general immorality&quot;. Like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Mozart found the French language inherently unmusical and &quot;so damned impossible where music is concerned&quot;, ironizing that &quot;the devil himself must have invented the language of these people&quot;. He felt that French music was worthless: &quot;They understand nothing about music&quot;, echoing what Leopold had declared during their first visit to Paris: &quot;The whole of French music is not worth a sou&quot;. He judged their singers inept. &quot;I&#x27;m surrounded by nothing but beasts and animals. But how can it be otherwise, for they&#x27;re just the same in all their actions, emotions, and passions.&quot;

Suspicious by nature, Mozart ended up distrusting Grimm, while &quot;Grimm himself was bound to find Mozart increasingly baffling as a person — with his curious mixture of self-confidence and dreaminess&quot;. Mozart found himself obliged to borrow &quot;as much as fifteen louis d&#x27;or&quot; from Grimm. Voltaire&#x27;s death on 30 May 1778 made clear &quot;the full extent of the yawning void between them&quot;. Grimm warned Leopold that the need for continual and intense networking in Paris was too demanding for Wolfgang, &quot;for it is a very tiring thing to run to the four corners of Paris and exhaust oneself in explanations. And then this profession will not please him, because it will keep him from writing, which is what he likes above all things.&quot; Their dealings &quot;ended on a note of the deepest disharmony.&quot; Leopold agreed that Mozart should leave Paris: &quot;You don&#x27;t like Paris, and on the whole I don&#x27;t blame you ... My next letter will tell you that you are to leave Paris.&quot; Grimm organized for Mozart&#x27;s trip to Strasbourg, promising a diligence to cover the trip in five days, but forced Mozart to travel by stagecoach, a journey that took twelve days. Mozart &quot;himself left the city on 26 September, as ill-tempered and disgruntled as when he had arrived there.&quot; Mozart broke the journey in Nancy on 3 October, finally arriving in Strasbourg on 14 October 1778.

In the course of his three visits, Mozart spent a total of 13 months in Paris, all of them under the guidance and assistance of Grimm.

=== Catherine II of Russia ===
Grimm&#x27;s introduction to Catherine II of Russia took place at Saint Petersburg in 1773, when he was in the suite of Wilhelmina of Hesse-Darmstadt on the occasion of her marriage to the Tsarevitch Paul. A few weeks later Diderot arrived. On 1 November they both became members of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Because of his atheism, Diderot had little success in the imperial capital, and when he criticized Catharine&#x27;s style of governing, Grimm moved away from him. According to Jonathan Israel, Grimm was a representative of the Enlightened Absolutism. Grimm introduced Ferdinando Galiani and Cesare Beccaria, and promoted Jean Huber and Johann Friedrich Reiffenstein in the Russian Empire. He became minister of Saxe-Gotha at the French court in 1776. In 1777, he again visited Saint Petersburg, where he remained for nearly a year.

Grimm loved to play chess and cards with the empress. According to Simon Dixon, he influenced Catherine with his ideas on Rousseau. He acted as Paris agent for the empress in the purchase of works of art, and executed many confidential commissions for her. With his help, the libraries of Diderot (in 1766) and Voltaire (in 1778) were bought and sent to the Russian capital. In 1779, he introduced Giacomo Quarenghi as an architect and Clodion as a sculptor, when Étienne Maurice Falconet came back to Paris. In 1787, Catherine asked Grimm to burn her letters to him, &quot;or else put them in safekeeping, so that no one can unearth them for a century.&quot;

=== Chevalier de Saint-Georges ===
Like Christoph Willibald Gluck and Ranieri de&#x27; Calzabigi, Grimm was occupied with operatic reform. Grimm loved theatre, criticized the Comédie-Française and praised the private theatre of Madame de Montesson, the wife of his employer.

In 1776, the &quot;&quot; (the Paris Opéra) was once again in dire straits. A &quot;consortium of capitalists&quot;, to quote the critic Baron Grimm, proposed Chevalier de Saint-Georges as the next director of the opera. He helped Saint-Georges, living in the adjacent mansion with Madame de Montesson. Mozart spent over two months next to Saint-Georges. The two mansions had a communal garden, a chapel and a theater.

== Retirement ==
From &quot;Erinnerungen einer Urgrossmutter&quot;, it becomes clear that, in 1792, he left Rue du Mont-Blanc (in 1792, during the French Revolution, &quot;rue de la Chaussée d&#x27;Antin&quot; was renamed &quot;rue du Mont-Blanc&quot;, after the department of that name. It regained its original name in 1815), and settled in Gotha, living in the ducal palace Friedenstein Palace. His poverty was relieved by Catherine, who shortly before her death appointed him minister of Russia at Hamburg. Although not very thrilled, he travelled with Émilie de Belsunce, Mme. d&#x27;Épinay&#x27;s granddaughter, later Comtesse de Bueil. When he suddenly became blind on 17 January 1797, he gave up his new post. (Grimm had problems with his eyesight since 1762.) He and the young Émilie stayed a few weeks in Altona. They travelled to Braunschweig, where they stayed from the summer of 1797 until June 1800, and where Émilie was tutored by Willem Bilderdijk. Grimm was then invited again by Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He died at Gotha on 19 December 1807.

The main-belt asteroid 6912 Grimm was named after him.

== Works ==
Grimm&#x27;s &#x27;, was edited, with many excisions, by Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard and published at Paris in 1812, in 6 vols. 8vo; &#x27;, in 1812 in 5 vols. 8vo; and &#x27;, in 1813 in 5 vols. 8vo. A supplementary volume appeared in 1814; the whole correspondence was collected and published by , with the assistance of A. Chaudé, in a &#x27; (Paris, 1829, 15 vols. 8vo); and the &quot; was published in 1829. The standard edition was that of Maurice Tourneux (16 vols., 1877–1882). It is now being replaced by the new edition published by Ulla Kölving at the , Ferney-Voltaire.

Grimm&#x27;s &quot;, and &quot;Catherine&#x27;s correspondence with Grimm&quot; (1774–1796) were published by Yakov Grot in 1880, in the collection of the Russian Imperial Historical Society. She treats him very familiarly and calls him Heraclite, Georges Dandin, etc. At the time of the Revolution, she begged him to destroy her letters, but he refused, and after his death, they were returned to Saint Petersburg. Grimm&#x27;s side of the correspondence, however, is only partially preserved. He signs himself &quot;Pleureur&quot;. Some of Grimm&#x27;s letters, besides the official correspondence, are included in the edition of Tourneux; others are contained in the &quot;Erinnerungen einer Urgrossmutter&quot; of Katharina von Bechtolsheim, edited (Berlin, 1902) by Count C. Oberndorff.

<text>USS &quot;Brooklyn&quot; (ACR-3/CA-3) was the third United States Navy armored cruiser, the only one to be named at commissioning for a city rather than a state.

Ordered for $3,450,420.29 (hull and machinery), she was launched on 2 October 1895 by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia; sponsored by Miss Ida May Schieren, daughter of Charles A. Schieren, Mayor of Brooklyn, New York; and commissioned on 1 December 1896, Captain Francis Augustus Cook in command.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Brooklyn&quot; was said to be an improved at the time of her completion. She was also designed by the Navy Department and was about 1,000 tons larger, which allowed for a raised forecastle for better seakeeping. However, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; sacrificed armor for improved armament. She had eight 8-inch guns compared to &quot;New York&quot;″s six, and all were in twin turrets. The secondary armament was increased in caliber from &quot;New York&quot;″s 4-inch guns to 5-inch guns. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; had her turrets in a &quot;lozenge&quot; arrangement (one each fore and aft, one on each side) and also had a tumblehome hull, which allowed the side turrets to fire dead ahead and astern. She was the only US Navy ship built with this turret arrangement. The tumblehome hull and &quot;lozenge&quot; arrangement were rare in the US Navy, but at the time were prevalent in the French Navy and in French-designed Russian ships, such as the French &quot;Magenta&quot; and the Russian &quot;Tsesarevich&quot;.

Compared with &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; had a belt versus , barbettes versus , and the same turret and deck armor.

===Armament===
&quot;Brooklyn&quot; as built had a main armament of eight /35 caliber Mark 3 and/or Mark 4 breech-loading rifles in four twin Mark 8 turrets in a &quot;lozenge&quot; arrangement. The forward and starboard side turrets were electric-powered, while the other two turrets were steam-powered. This was to test which system was better, and as a result the Navy adopted electric power for future turret designs. Secondary armament was twelve /40 caliber rapid fire (RF) guns in sponsons along the sides, along with twelve 6-pounder () Driggs-Schroeder RF guns, four 1-pounder () Driggs-Schroeder saluting guns, and five 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. Some additional weapons on wheeled carriages were carried for use by landing parties; these included two 3-inch (76 mm) field artillery pieces and four Gatling guns.

===Armor===

&quot;Brooklyn&quot; had significantly less protection than &quot;New York&quot;, to allow for increased armament. The belt was thick and deep, of which was below the waterline. It protected only the machinery spaces. The armored deck was thick on its sloped sides and in the flat middle amidships, but only at the ends. The gun turrets had up to of armor, on barbettes with protecting the ammunition hoists. The secondary gun sponsons had , while the conning tower was thick.

===Engineering===

&quot;Brooklyn&quot; was intended to be relatively fast at , and achieved on trials. Her machinery was generally similar to &quot;New York&quot;, but achieved additional horsepower and an extra knot on trials. Four triple-expansion engines totaling (designed, on trials) were clutched in tandem, two on each of two shafts. The forward engines could be disconnected to conserve fuel at an economical cruising speed. In the US Navy, only &quot;New York&quot; shared this feature, which proved something of a liability in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, when both ships were operating with the forward engines disconnected and did not have time to reconnect them, thus limiting their speed. Seven coal-fired cylindrical boilers, five double-ended and two single-ended, supplied steam to the engines.

===Refits===

&quot;Brooklyn&quot;″s refits were relatively modest. Her torpedo tubes were removed prior to 1914; one source says by 1903. By 1917 the 5-inch guns had been reduced to eight while two /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns were added.

==Service history==

&quot;Brooklyn&quot;″s first assignment was a special cruise to Britain with representatives of the U.S. for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The cruiser returned to the east coast in July 1897 and cruised there and in the West Indies until becoming flagship of the Flying Squadron under Commodore W. S. Schley on 28 March 1898.

===Spanish–American War=== 
During the Spanish–American War, the Flying Squadron arrived at Cienfuegos, Cuba on 21 May and established the blockade of that port. On 26 May, the Squadron arrived at Santiago de Cuba, where the Spanish fleet was being held behind the protection of the forts. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was a key vessel in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3 July, in which the Spanish Fleet was destroyed. Although she was struck 20 times by whole shot, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; suffered only one man wounded (Fireman J. Bevins) and one man killed (Chief Yeoman George Henry Ellis).

&quot;Brooklyn&quot; returned to Tompkinsville, New York on 20 August; cruised along the Atlantic coast and in Caribbean waters; participated in the Spanish–American War Victory Celebration at New York on 5 October; and in the Dewey Celebration at New York in September 1899. She left Hampton Roads on 16 October and sailed via the Suez Canal to Manila, Philippine Islands, where she arrived on 16 December. She became flagship of the Asiatic Squadron and participated in the China Relief Expedition (8 July – 11 October 1900. She made a cruise to the Dutch East Indies, Australia and New Zealand from 10 April – 7 August 1901; the last stage was to Melbourne, Auckland, Wellington and Sydney. She remained with the Asiatic Squadron until 1 March 1902, when she sailed for the United States via the Suez Canal and arrived at the New York Navy Yard on 1 May.

===Post-war===

On 20 May 1902, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was at Havana, Cuba, for the ceremonies to transfer the authority on that island from the United States Government to the Cuban Government. In June–July, she was on special duty in connection with the funeral of the late British Ambassador to the United States Lord Pauncefote. During the next four years, she cruised with the North Atlantic Fleet and the European Squadron. She was involved in the intervention in Syria from 8 September to 17 October 1903 as well as the intervention in Djibouti from 21 November 1903 to 18 January 1904.

&quot;Brooklyn&quot; returned to New York on 26 May 1905. On 7 June, as flagship of Rear Admiral Charles Dwight Sigsbee, she sailed for Cherbourg, France, where the remains of the late John Paul Jones were received aboard and brought to America. Upon arrival at Annapolis, Commodore Jones&#x27; remains were transferred ashore to a receiving vault at the United States Naval Academy with appropriate ceremonies on 23 July.

Following a naval militia cruise (from 3–23 August 1905) and a tour in the Mediterranean (from 28 December 1905 – 8 May 1906), &quot;Brooklyn&quot; went into reserve at the League Island Navy Yard in Philadelphia on 16 May 1906. Except for a short period (from 30 June – 2 August 1906) in commission for special service at Havana, Cuba, she remained in reserve until the spring of 1907. From 12 April – 4 December 1907, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; served as part of the permanent display at the Jamestown Exposition in Jamestown, Virginia. Following her return to Philadelphia, Brooklyn went into reserve again on 21 December.

Placed out of commission on 23 June 1908, she was commissioned in ordinary on 2 March 1914. She was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and served as receiving ship at Boston Navy Yard from 24 July 1914 – 13 March 1915. She was placed in full commission at Philadelphia on 9 May 1915 and served on Neutrality Patrol around Boston Harbor until November, when she sailed to the Asiatic Station to serve as flagship for the Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet. She attended to regular military and diplomatic duties in China, Japan, and Russia until September 1919, when she became the flagship of Commander, Division 1, Asiatic Fleet. In January 1920, she was assigned to the Pacific Fleet as flagship of Commander, Destroyer Squadrons, and remained there until 15 January 1921. She was redesignated as CA-3 (heavy cruiser) on 17 July 1920 as part of a fleetwide redesignation plan. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was placed out of commission for the final time at Mare Island Navy Yard on 9 March 1921 and sold for disposal on 20 December.

<text>The Mixtecs (), or Mixtecos, are Indigenous Mesoamerican peoples of Mexico inhabiting the region known as La Mixteca of Oaxaca and Puebla as well as La Montaña Region and Costa Chica Regions of the state of Guerrero. The Mixtec culture was the main Mixtec civilization, which lasted from around 1500 BCE until being conquered by the Spanish in 1523.

The Mixtec region is generally divided into three subregions based on geography: the Mixteca Alta (Upper Mixtec or Ñuu Savi Sukun), the Mixteca Baja (Lower Mixtec or Ñuu I&#x27;ni), and the Mixteca Costa (Coastal Mixtec or Ñuu Andivi). The Alta is drier with higher elevations, while the Baja is lower in elevation, hot but dry, and the Coasta is also low in elevation but much more humid and tropical. The Alta has seen the most study by archaeologists, with evidence for human settlement going back to the Archaic and Early Formative periods. The first urbanized sites emerged here. Long considered to be part of the larger Mixteca region, groups living in the Baja were probably more culturally related to neighboring peoples in Eastern Guerrero than they were to the Mixtecs of the Alta. They even had their own hieroglyphic writing system called ñuiñe. The Costa only came under control of the Mixtecs during the military campaigns of the Mixtec cultural hero Eight Deer Jaguar Claw. Originally from Tilantongo in the Alta, Eight Deer and his armies conquered several major and minor kingdoms on their way to the coast, establishing the capital of Tututepec in the Lower Río Verde valley. Previously, the Costa had been primarily occupied by the Chatinos.

In pre-Columbian times, some Mixtec kingdoms competed and allied with each other and with Zapotec kingdoms in the Central Valleys. Like the rest of the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Mixtecs were conquered by the Spanish invaders and their indigenous allies in the 16th century. Pre-Columbian Mixtecs numbered around 1.5 million. Today there are approximately 800,000 Mixtec people in Mexico, and there are also large populations in the United States. The Mixtec languages form a major branch of the Oto-Manguean language family.

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The term Mixtec (&quot;Mixteco&quot; in Spanish) comes from the Nahuatl word &quot;mixtecah&quot; , &quot;cloud people&quot;. There are many names that the Mixtecs have for naming themselves: &quot;ñuù savi, nayívi savi, ñuù davi, nayivi davi&quot;. etc. All these denominations can be translated as &#x27;the land of the rain&#x27;. The historic homeland of Mixtec people is La Mixteca, called in Mixtec language &quot;Ñuu Savi&quot;, &quot;Ñuu Djau&quot;, &quot;Ñuu Davi&quot;, etc., depending on the local variant. They call their language &quot;sa&#x27;an davi&quot;, &quot;da&#x27;an davi&quot; or &quot;tu&#x27;un savi&quot;.

==Overview==
In pre-Columbian times, the Mixtec were one of the major civilizations of Mesoamerica. Important ancient centers of the Mixtec include the ancient capital of Tilantongo, as well as the sites of Achiutla, Cuilapan, Huajuapan, Mitla, Tlaxiaco, Tututepec, Juxtlahuaca, and Yucuñudahui. The Mixtecs also made major constructions at the ancient city of Monte Albán (which had originated as a Zapotec city before the Mixtecs gained control of it). The work of Mixtec artisans who produced work in stone, wood, and metal was well regarded throughout ancient Mesoamerica.

According to West, &quot;the Mixtec of Oaxaca...were the foremost goldsmiths of Mesoamerica,&quot; which included the &quot;lost-wax casting of gold and its alloys.&quot;

At the height of the Aztec Empire, many indigenous people in Oaxaca, including the Mixtecs and Zapotecs, would suffer under at the hands of the Aztecs. In the 1450s, Mixtecs would be weakened after the Aztec armies crossed the mountains into the Valley of Oaxaca with the intention of extending their hegemony. Aztec forces triumphed over the Mixtecs in 1458. In 1486, the Aztecs established a fort on the hill of Huaxyácac (now called El Fortín), overlooking the present city of Oaxaca, which allowed the Aztecs to enforce tribute collection from the Mixtecs and Zapotecs. However, not all Mixtec towns became vassals. The Mixtecs put up some resistance to Spanish forces led by Pedro de Alvarado. However, they would be subdued by the Spanish and their central Mexican allies led by Francisco de Orozco in 1521. Upon Orozco&#x27;s arrival to the Valley of Oaxaca on November 25, 1521, the Mixtecs would be peacefully submit to Spanish rule, though some resistance would continue in Antequera before ending by the end of 1521.

Mixtecs have migrated to various parts of both Mexico and the United States. In recent years a large exodus of indigenous peoples from Oaxaca, such as the Zapotec and Triqui, has seen them emerge as one of the most numerous groups of Amerindians in the United States. As of 2011, an estimated 150,000 Mixteco people were living in California, and 25,000 to 30,000 in New York City. Large Mixtec communities exist in the border cities of Tijuana, Baja California, San Diego, California and Tucson, Arizona. Mixtec communities are generally described as transnational or trans-border because of their ability to maintain and reaffirm social ties between their native homelands and diasporic communities. (See: Mixtec transnational migration.)

==Mixtecs in the colonial era==

There is considerable documentation in the Mixtec (Ñudzahui) native language for the colonial era, which has been studied as part of the New Philology. Mixtec documentation indicates parallels between many indigenous social and political structures with those in the Nahua areas, but published research on the Mixtecs does not primarily focus on economic matters. There is considerable Mixtec documentation for land issues, but sparse for market activity, perhaps because indigenous cabildos did not regulate commerce or mediate economic disputes except for land. Long-distance trade existed in the prehispanic era and continued in indigenous hands in the early colonial. In the second half of the colonial period, there were bilingual Mixtec merchants, dealing in both Spanish and indigenous goods, who operated regionally. However, in the Mixteca “by the eighteenth century, commerce was dominated by Spaniards in all but the most local venues of exchange, involving the sale of agricultural commodities and indigenous crafts or the resale of imported goods.”.

Despite the development of a local exchange economy, many Spaniards with economic interests in Oaxaca, including “[s]ome of the Mixteca priests, merchants, and landowners maintained permanent residence in Puebla, and labor for the &quot;obrajes&quot; (textile workshops) of the city of Puebla in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was sometimes recruited from peasant villages in the Mixteca.&quot; There is evidence of community litigation against Mixtec caciques who leased land to Spaniards and the growth of individually contracted wage labor. Mixtec documentation from the late eighteenth century indicates that &quot;most caciques were simply well-to-do investors in Spanish-style enterprises&quot;; some married non-Indians; and in the late colonial era had little claim to hereditary authority.

==Geography==

The Mixtec area, both historically and currently, corresponds roughly to the western half of the state of Oaxaca, with some Mixtec communities extending into the neighboring state of Puebla to the north-west and also the state of Guerrero. The Mixtec people and their homelands are often subdivided into three geographic areas: The &quot;Mixteca Alta&quot; or Highland Mixtec living in the mountains in, around, and to the west of the Valley of Oaxaca; the &quot;Mixteca Baja&quot; or Lowland Mixtec living to the north and west of these highlands, and the &quot;Mixteca de la Costa&quot; or Coastal Mixtec living in the southern plains and the coast of the Pacific Ocean. For most of Mixtec history, the Mixteca Alta was the dominant political force, with the capitals of the Mixtec nation located in the central highlands. The valley of Oaxaca itself was often a disputed border region, sometimes dominated by the Mixtec and sometimes by their neighbors to the east, the Zapotec.

An ancient Coixtlahuaca Basin cave site known as the Colossal Natural Bridge is an important sacred place for the Mixtec.

==Language, codices, and artwork==
The Mixtecan languages (in their many variants) were estimated to be spoken by about 300,000 people at the end of the 20th century, although the majority of Mixtec speakers also had at least a working knowledge of the Spanish language. Some Mixtecan languages are called by names other than Mixtec, particularly Cuicatec (Cuicateco), and Triqui (or Trique).

The Mixtec are well known in the anthropological world for their Codices or phonetic pictures in which they wrote their history and genealogies in deerskin in the &quot;fold-book&quot; form. The best-known story of the Mixtec Codices is that of Lord Eight Deer, named after the day in which he was born, whose personal name is Jaguar Claw, and whose epic history is related in several codices, including the Codex Bodley and Codex Zouche-Nuttall. He successfully conquered and united most of the Mixteca region.

They were also known for their exceptional mastery of jewelry and mosaic, among which gold and turquoise figure prominently. Products by Mixtec goldsmiths formed an important part of the tribute the Mixtecs paid to the Aztecs during parts of their history. Turquoise mosaic masks also played an important role in both political and religious functions. These masks were used as gifts to form political alliances, in ceremonies during which the wearer of the mask impersonated a god, and were fixed to funerary bundles that were seen as oracles.

<text>Diffusing capacity of the lung (DL) (also known as &quot;transfer factor&quot;) measures the transfer of gas from air in the lung, to the red blood cells in lung blood vessels. It is part of a comprehensive series of pulmonary function tests to determine the overall ability of the lung to transport gas into and out of the blood. DL, especially DLCO, is reduced in certain diseases of the lung and heart. DLCO measurement has been standardized according to a position paper by a task force of the European Respiratory and American Thoracic Societies.

In respiratory physiology, the diffusing capacity has a long history of great utility, representing conductance of gas across the alveolar-capillary membrane and also takes into account factors affecting the behaviour of a given gas with hemoglobin.

The term may be considered a misnomer as it represents neither diffusion nor a capacity (as it is typically measured under submaximal conditions) nor capacitance. In addition, gas transport is only diffusion limited in extreme cases, such as for oxygen uptake at very low ambient oxygen or very high pulmonary blood flow.

The diffusing capacity does not directly measure the primary cause of hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen, namely mismatch of ventilation to perfusion:
* Not all pulmonary arterial blood goes to areas of the lung where gas exchange can occur (the anatomic or physiologic shunts), and this poorly oxygenated blood rejoins the well oxygenated blood from healthy lung in the pulmonary vein. Together, the mixture has less oxygen than that blood from the healthy lung alone, and so is hypoxemic.
* Similarly, not all inspired air goes to areas of the lung where gas exchange can occur (the anatomic and the physiological dead spaces), and so is wasted.

==Testing==

The single-breath diffusing capacity test is the most common way to determine formula_1. The test is performed by having the subject blow out all of the air that they can, leaving only the residual lung volume of gas. The person then inhales a test gas mixture rapidly and completely, reaching the total lung capacity as nearly as possible. This test gas mixture contains a small amount of carbon monoxide (usually 0.3%) and a &quot;tracer gas&quot; that is freely distributed throughout the alveolar space but which doesn&#x27;t cross the alveolar-capillary membrane. Helium and methane are two such gasses. The test gas is held in the lung for about 10 seconds during which time the CO (but &quot;not&quot; the tracer gas) continuously moves from the alveoli into the blood. Then the subject exhales.

The anatomy of the airways means inspired air must pass through the mouth, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles (anatomical dead space) before it gets to the alveoli where gas exchange will occur; on exhalation, alveolar gas must return along the same path, and so the exhaled sample will be purely alveolar only after a 500 to 1,000 ml of gas has been breathed out. While it is algebraically possible to approximate the effects of anatomy (the &quot;three-equation method&quot;), disease states introduce considerable uncertainty to this approach. Instead, the first 500 to 1,000 ml of the expired gas is disregarded and the next portion which contain gas that has been in the alveoli is analyzed. By analyzing the concentrations of carbon monoxide and inert gas in the inspired gas and in the exhaled gas, it is possible to calculate formula_2 according to Equation . First, the &quot;rate&quot; at which CO is taken up by the lung is calculated according to:
 &lt;/math&gt; . | }}
::::The pulmonary function equipment monitors the change in the concentration of CO that occurred during the breath hold, formula_3, and also records the time formula_4.
::::The volume of the alveoli, formula_5, is determined by the degree to which the tracer gas has been diluted by inhaling it into the lung.

Similarly,
 = V_B * F_{A_{CO_{O}}} &lt;/math&gt; . | }}
where
::::formula_6 is the initial alveolar fractional CO concentration, as calculated by the dilution of the tracer gas.
::::formula_7 is the barometric pressure

Other methods that are not so widely used at present can measure the diffusing capacity. These include the steady state diffusing capacity that is performed during regular tidal breathing, or the rebreathing method that requires rebreathing from a reservoir of gas mixtures.

== Calculation ==

The diffusion capacity for oxygen formula_8 is the proportionality factor relating the rate of oxygen uptake into the lung to the oxygen gradient between the capillary blood and the alveoli (per Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion). In respiratory physiology, it is convenient to express the transport of gas molecules as changes in volume, since formula_9 (i.e., in a gas, a volume is proportional to the number of molecules in it). Further, the oxygen concentration (partial pressure) in the pulmonary artery is taken to be representative of capillary blood. Thus, formula_8 can be calculated as the rate that oxygen is taken up by the lung formula_11 divided by the oxygen gradient between the alveoli (&quot;A&quot;) and the pulmonary artery (&quot;a&quot;).
 =\frac {\dot{V}_{O_{2}}} {P_{A_{O_2}} - P_{a_{O_2}}} \simeq \frac {\dot{V}_{O_{2}}} {P_{A_{O_2}} - P_{v_{O_2}}}&lt;/math&gt; | }}
::(For formula_12, say &quot;V dot&quot;. This is the notation of Isaac Newton for a first derivative (or rate) and is commonly used in respiratory physiology for this purpose.)

::::formula_13 is the rate that oxygen is taken up by the lung (ml/min).
::::formula_14 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli.
::::formula_15 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary artery.
::::formula_16 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the systemic veins (where it can actually be measured).

Thus, the higher the diffusing capacity formula_1, the more gas will be transferred into the lung per unit time for a given gradient in partial pressure (or concentration) of the gas. Since it can be possible to know the alveolar oxygen concentration and the rate of oxygen uptake - but not the oxygen concentration in the pulmonary artery - it is the venous oxygen concentration that is generally employed as a useful approximation in a clinical setting.

Sampling the oxygen concentration in the pulmonary artery is a highly invasive procedure, but fortunately another similar gas can be used instead that obviates this need (DLCO). Carbon monoxide (CO) is tightly and rapidly bound to hemoglobin in the blood, so the partial pressure of CO in the capillaries is negligible and the second term in the denominator can be ignored. For this reason, CO is generally the test gas used to measure the diffusing capacity and the formula_1 equation simplifies to:
 = \frac {\dot{V}_{CO}} {P_{A_{CO}} }&lt;/math&gt;. | }}

== Interpretation ==

In general, a healthy individual has a value of formula_19 between 75% and 125% of the average. However, individuals vary according to age, sex, height and a variety of other parameters. For this reason, reference values have been published, based on populations of healthy subjects as well as measurements made at altitude, for children and some specific population groups.

===Blood CO levels may not be negligible===

In heavy smokers, blood CO is great enough to influence the measurement of formula_19, and requires an adjustment of the calculation when COHb is greater than 2% of the whole.

&lt;/math&gt;}}
While formula_21 is of great practical importance, being the overall measure of gas transport, the interpretation of this measurement is complicated by the fact that it does not measure any one part of a multi-step process. So as a conceptual aid in interpreting the results of this test, the time needed to transfer CO from the air to the blood can be divided into two parts. First CO crosses the alveolar capillary membrane (represented by formula_22 ) and then CO combines with the hemoglobin in capillary red blood cells at a rate formula_23 times the volume of capillary blood present (formula_24). Since the steps are in series, the conductances add as the sum of the reciprocals:

} =\frac {1} {D_M} + \frac {1} {\theta * V_c}&lt;/math&gt; . | }}

&lt;/math&gt;}}

The volume of blood in the lung capillaries, formula_24, changes appreciably during ordinary activities such as exercise. Simply breathing in brings some additional blood &quot;into&quot; the lung because of the negative intrathoracic pressure required for inspiration. At the extreme, inspiring against a closed glottis, the Müller&#x27;s maneuver, pulls blood &quot;into&quot; the chest. The opposite is also true, as exhaling increases the pressure within the thorax and so tends to push blood out; the Valsalva maneuver is an exhalation against a closed airway which can move blood &quot;out&quot; of the lung. So breathing hard during exercise will bring extra blood into the lung during inspiration and push blood out during expiration. But during exercise (or more rarely when there is a structural defect in the heart that allows blood to be shunted from the high pressure, systemic circulation to the low pressure, pulmonary circulation) there is also increased blood flow throughout the body, and the lung adapts by recruiting extra capillaries to carry the increased output of the heart, further increasing the quantity of blood in the lung. Thus formula_19 will appear to increase when the subject is not at rest, particularly during inspiration.

In disease, hemorrhage into the lung will increase the number of haemoglobin molecules in contact with air, and so measured formula_19 will increase. In this case, the carbon monoxide used in the test will bind to haemoglobin that has bled into the lung. This does not reflect an increase in diffusing capacity of the lung to transfer oxygen to the systemic circulation.

Finally, formula_24 is increased in obesity and when the subject lies down, both of which increase the blood in the lung by compression and by gravity and thus both increase formula_19.

The rate of CO uptake into the blood, formula_23, depends on the concentration of hemoglobin in that blood, abbreviated Hb in the CBC (Complete Blood Count). More hemoglobin is present in polycythemia, and so formula_19 is elevated. In anemia, the opposite is true. In environments with high levels of CO in the inhaled air (such as smoking), a fraction of the blood&#x27;s hemoglobin is rendered ineffective by its tight binding to CO, and so is analogous to anemia. It is recommended that formula_19 be adjusted when blood CO is high.

The lung blood volume is also reduced when blood flow is interrupted by blood clots (pulmonary emboli) or reduced by bone deformities of the thorax, for instance scoliosis and kyphosis.

Varying the ambient concentration of oxygen also alters formula_23. At high altitude, inspired oxygen is low and more of the blood&#x27;s hemoglobin is free to bind CO; thus formula_23 is increased and formula_19 appears to be increased. Conversely, supplemental oxygen increases Hb saturation, decreasing formula_23 and formula_19.

Diseases that alter lung tissue reduce both formula_22 and formula_39 to a variable extent, and so decrease formula_19.
# Loss of lung parenchyma in diseases like emphysema.
# Diseases that scar the lung (the interstitial lung disease), such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or sarcoidosis
# Swelling of lung tissue (pulmonary edema) due to heart failure, or due to an acute inflammatory response to allergens (acute interstitial pneumonitis).
# Diseases of the blood vessels in the lung, either inflammatory (pulmonary vasculitis) or hypertrophic (pulmonary hypertension).

&lt;/math&gt;.}}
# Alveolar hemorrhage Goodpasture&#x27;s syndrome, polycythemia, left to right intracardiac shunts, due increase in volume of blood exposed to inspired gas.
# Asthma due to better perfusion of apices of lung. This is caused by increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and/or due to more negative pleural pressure generated during inspiration due to bronchial narrowing.

==History==

In one sense, it is remarkable that DLCO has retained such clinical utility. The technique was invented to settle one of the great controversies of pulmonary physiology a century ago, namely the question of whether oxygen and the other gases were actively transported into and out of the blood by the lung, or whether gas molecules diffused passively. Remarkable too is the fact that both sides used the technique to gain evidence for their respective hypotheses. To begin with, Christian Bohr invented the technique, using a protocol analogous to the steady state diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, and concluded that oxygen was actively transported into the lung. His student, August Krogh developed the single breath diffusion capacity technique along with his wife Marie, and convincingly demonstrated that gasses diffuse passively, a finding that led to the demonstration that capillaries in the blood were recruited into use as needed – a Nobel Prize–winning idea.

<doc id="195748" wikidata="Q7867882" url="?curid=195748" title="USS Brooklyn (1858)">
<text>USS &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was a sloop-of-war authorized by the U.S. Congress and commissioned in 1859. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was active in Caribbean operations until the start of the American Civil War at which time she became an active participant in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America.

With her one 10-inch gun and twenty 9-inch guns, &quot;Brooklyn &quot; was a formidable fighting ship that could deliver damaging broadsides, and served on the Atlantic Ocean coast as well as the Gulf Coast of the United States in intercepting blockade runners. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; also served gallantly attacking Confederate forts and other installations on the Mississippi River.

Post-war, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; remained active, serving for some years in the European theatre, as well as circumnavigating the globe. She was retired in 1889 and sold in 1890 after having well served her country for over three decades.

== Service history ==

===Early career===
&quot;Brooklyn&quot; – the first ship so-named by the U.S. Navy – was the first of five screw sloops of war authorized by the U.S. Congress on March 3, 1857; laid down later that year by the firm of Jacob A. Westervelt and Son; launched in 1858; and commissioned on January 26, 1859, Capt. David G. Farragut in command. On February 5, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; got underway for a trial run to Beaufort, South Carolina, where she arrived on the 11th. Following a week&#x27;s visit to that port, she headed for the West Indies to investigate conditions in Haiti where liberal forces had ousted Emperor Soulouque and installed Fabre Geffrard as President. Farragut found that the people of Haiti were delighted to be free of the oppressive rule of the former monarch and with the end of a racial war that had bled their nation. Upon the recommendation of the American consul, Farragut sailed for the Isthmus of Panama. After visiting Aspinwall, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; set a course for the Mexican coast and reached Veracruz early in April. The legal president of Mexico, Benito Juárez – who had been driven from Mexico City by forces of General Miguel Miramón of the Clerical Party—was making that seaport his temporary capital.

The United States, which recognized the Juarez government, had sent former Maryland Congressman Robert Milligan McLane to Veracruz as the American minister and ordered Farragut to make &quot;Brooklyn&quot; available to McLane so that he might keep abreast of developments in the ongoing civil war and assist American consuls who were striving to protect U.S. citizens and property. During part of the time the screw sloop of war lay off Veracruz, McLane resided on board. In July &quot;Brooklyn&quot; proceeded to Pensacola, Florida, for coal, provisions, and water, and she reached that port on the 15th. As soon as she finished replenishing, the ship returned to Veracruz, but she was back at Pensacola again by September 7. From there, she sailed for New York and reached the New York Navy Yard on the 26th of that month. With McLane—who had returned to the United States for consultations with the U.S. Secretary of State and the U.S. President—on board, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; departed New York Harbor on November 8 and headed back toward the Gulf of Mexico. She arrived at Veracruz on the 21st and remained in port while McLane negotiated an agreement with the Juárez Government. After the treaty was signed on December 12, she got underway again and proceeded to New Orleans, Louisiana, where she arrived on the 18th.

With her bunkers full once more, she headed down the Mississippi River on Christmas Eve and crossed the gulf to Veracruz. However, in mid- January she reembarked McLane and took him to New Orleans so that he might catch a train for Washington, D.C., where he was needed to explain the treaty he had negotiated with Juárez to doubtful senators. From New Orleans, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; proceeded to Pensacola to prepare for a return to Mexican waters. However, before McLane could get back to the Gulf Coast from Washington, orders reached Pensacola sending her north. She stood out to sea on February 19, 1860 and reached New York City on the 27th. Underway again on March 11, she arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, the following afternoon and there awaited McLane whom she embarked and delivered back to Veracruz on the 28th. The steamer operated along the Mexican coast through the spring and into the summer carrying McLane to various ports where he conferred with the American consuls. Late in July she left the Mexican coast and returned to Norfolk early in August. There, she received orders to prepare for a voyage carrying members of a scientific expedition to the Gulf of Mexico to find a route across the isthmus of Chiriqui. She sailed on the 13th and reached Chiriqui, Boca del Toro, Panama, on the 24th. But for a run to Aspinwall from September 12 to 17, she remained off the expedition base at Chiriqui until mid-October when she returned to Aspinwall. There on October 20, Capt. William S. Walker relieved Farragut in command.

=== Civil War service ===
====1861====
Shortly thereafter, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, and she remained in the Norfolk area through the end of 1860 while enthusiasm for secession swept through the deep South in the wake of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election to the presidency. Early in January 1861, Capt. Walker received orders sending &quot;Brooklyn&quot; to Charleston, South Carolina, with messages for the steamer &quot;Star of the West&quot; which had sailed south to relieve beleaguered Fort Sumter. However, when she reached Charleston Harbor, she found the channel leading into port obstructed and learned that the resupply effort had failed. Consequently, she returned to Hampton Roads.

The following month, she received orders for a similar mission which she carried out with great success, relieving Fort Pickens, at Pensacola, Florida. After helping to thwart Confederate attempts to wrest that highly valuable Federal toehold on strategic Florida territory from Union hands, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; sailed west along the Gulf of Mexico coast to establish the blockade of the Mississippi Passes. She, , and two gunboats made a number of captures off Pass a l&#x27;Outre and Southwest Pass, but so many ships were getting by them that Comdr. Charles Henry Poor – who relieved Capt. Walker as &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s&quot; commander in April 1861—tried to go upriver to the Head of Passes where traffic might better be throttled. Low water, however, caused her to run aground twice before she abandoned the effort. On June 30, 1861, the Confederate warship CSS &quot;Sumter&quot; raced out of Pass a l&#x27;Outre while &quot;Brooklyn&quot; had left her station in pursuit of another ship. Upon seeing the fleet Southern cruiser, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; forsook her first chase and used full sail and maximum steam in an attempt to overtake &quot;Sumter&quot; but to no avail, for her quarry soon escaped over the horizon and out of sight. Badly in need of repairs, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; sailed north late in the autumn and was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

Recommissioned on December 19, 1861, the screw sloop—commanded by Capt. Thomas T. Craven—dropped down the Delaware River on the 27th and stood out to sea, bound for the gulf. After stopping at Key West, Florida, she reached Ship Island, Mississippi, on January 22, 1862. On February 2 she sailed for Pass a l&#x27;Outre where, on the 19th, she captured the steamer &quot;Magnolia&quot; which was attempting to slip out to sea with 1,200 bales of cotton. Meanwhile, the Navy Department had divided its forces in the gulf into two organizations: the East Gulf Blockading Squadron, commanded by Flag Officer William W. McKean, and the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, commanded by Flag Officer David G. Farragut who arrived at Ship Island in March. Besides carrying out the blockade, Farragut had been instructed to lead a fleet of warships up the Mississippi River to capture New Orleans, Louisiana. After spending the latter part of March and the first part of April getting his deep-draft ocean-going vessels over the bar and into the river, Farragut moved his fleet up the Mississippi to a position just out of range of the guns that guarded the river at Confederate Forts Jackson and St. Philip.

==== 1862 ====

Attached to Farragut&#x27;s force was a flotilla of small sailing vessels each of which carried a 13-inch mortar. In mid-April these little warships—mostly schooners—began a bombardment of the Southern forts and continued the attack until the early hours of April 24 when they increased the tempo of their firing to their maximum rate while Farragut&#x27;s deep-draft men-of-war got underway for a dash past the Southern guns. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was

 ... struck several times before she could bring her guns to bear. As soon as that could be accomplished we opened fire upon Fort Jackson and also upon Fort St. Philip, fighting both batteries at intervals. We were fouled by one of our gunboats, but received no damage. The ram &quot;Manassas&quot; attempted to sink us by running into us, but did us little injury. A fire raft came down the river upon us, but we succeeded in crossing it without injury. We came near getting foul of some hulks and rafts of logs, which kept us under fire longer than we otherwise should have been.

Eight men from &quot;Brooklyn&quot; were killed in the action and 21 wounded before she reached comparative safety beyond the range of the Rebel artillery. Later that day, after making needed repairs, Farragut&#x27;s warships resumed their movement upriver and reached New Orleans on April 25. When that city had surrendered, &quot;Brooklyn&quot;—which had been damaged more seriously by her collision with the ram &quot;Manassas&quot; than Craven had at first realized—received a patch of heavy planking some 24 feet long over a long tear in her hull. One of &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s&quot; sailors, Quartermaster James Buck, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle.

Farragut&#x27;s orders called for him to clear the Mississippi of all Confederate forces afloat and of all defensive works along the river banks while moving up stream until meeting another Union squadron—commanded by Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis – which had begun fighting its way downriver from Cairo, Illinois. Hence, early in May after Union Army troops commanded by Major General Benjamin F. Butler had arrived in transports and had taken over New Orleans, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and six other warships ascended the river. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Natchez, Mississippi, surrendered with no resistance, but Vicksburg, Mississippi, proved to be another matter. The Confederate Army had so fortified its riverside hills that it could not be taken without the support of a strong land force. Since the Union Army did not have a sufficient number of troops available in the region to accomplish this purpose, Farragut&#x27;s men-of-war returned to New Orleans.

There awaiting him were orders from Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles reiterating the importance of a junction with Davis&#x27;s force above Vicksburg, Mississippi. Thus the Union warships again reversed course and painfully worked their way upstream to a position just out of range of Vicksburg&#x27;s guns. This time they had the support of the Mortar Flotilla which conducted an intense preliminary bombardment of the riverside fortress. At two hours past midnight on June 28, the fleet got underway in two columns and began steaming up stream. Unfortunately, the steamers that had towed the mortar schooners up stream got in the way of &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and two gunboats and prevented their getting upstream past the Vicksburg batteries. As a result they drew much of the Southern fire while Farragut&#x27;s other ships pushed upstream and out of range. Shortly before dawn, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; dropped down stream to a place of greater safety and remained there to be on hand to support Farragut in any way possible should an opportunity to do so occur before the Flag Officer returned below in mid-July. As the hot summer days passed, more and more illness broke out among the ship&#x27;s crew and the falling water level in the river made it necessary for the ship to retire downstream toward New Orleans.

Meanwhile, on July 2, Capt Henry H. Bell relieved Capt. Craven in command of &quot;Brooklyn&quot;. On August 6, the screw sloop engaged Confederate batteries at Donaldsonville, Louisiana, driving the Southern artillerymen from their guns; and, on the 9th and 10th, she took part in combined operations which partially destroyed that city in reprisal for guerrilla attacks on Union shipping from that town. Soon thereafter, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; left the Mississippi and steamed to Pensacola for more permanent repairs to the damage she had suffered while fighting her way past Forts Jackson and St. Philip and colliding with Manassas. On October 6, orders sent the ship to blockade duty off Mobile Bay, and she spent the rest of 1862 in that vicinity alert for blockade runners and the appearance of Confederate cruisers which might threaten Union gunboats guarding the coast.

====1863====
Early in January 1863, when word reached Farragut that a surprise Southern attack against Union warships at Galveston, Texas, had recaptured that port and broken the blockade there, he placed Bell in charge of the small force sent to reestablish Union control. Shoal water prevented &quot;Brooklyn&quot; from participating in a bombardment of Confederate gun positions in Galveston harbor on January 10; and on the night of the 11th, CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; sank &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s&quot; most formidable consort the sidewheel steamer , in a fierce but rapid engagement some 30 miles off Galveston. This setback prompted Bell to give up his plan to retake that port pending the arrival of powerful shallow draft reinforcements. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; did continue to blockade the Texas city into the summer. On 25 May, Bell &quot; ... left Commander James Robert Madison Mullany in the in charge of the blockade of Galveston ... and proceeded down the coast of Texas as far as the Rio Grande, to ascertain the amount of interior coast trade and its exit...On the morning of the 27th, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; captured the 17-ton, cotton-laden sloop, &quot;Blazer&quot;, which was heading for Matamoros, Mexico. The next day, boats from &quot;Brooklyn&quot; took the small sloop &quot;Kate&quot;. Three days later, she anchored off the bar outside Brazos Santiago, Texas&quot;, and sent &quot; ... an expedition of four boats and 87 men ... to capture vessels there …&quot;

As the Union boats approached Point Isabel, the Southerners &quot; ... set fire to a large schooner.&quot; They brought out the 100-ton schooner Star and a fishing scow. At Point Isabel, they captured the 100-ton, British sloop &quot;Victoria&quot; of Jamaica but ran that vessel aground while attempting to get out to sea and so burned her. After the landing parties had returned to the ship, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; returned to Galveston. Late in July she returned to New Orleans where, on August 2, Lt. Comdr. Chester Hatfield relieved Bell in command to free the commodore to take temporary command of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron while Farragut returned home in for a well-earned leave. On the 10th, Capt. George F. Emmons relieved Hatfield and sailed &quot;Brooklyn&quot; north on the 13th to receive badly needed repairs. She emerged from the Southwest Pass the next day; touched at Port Royal, South Carolina, on the 21st, at Charleston, South Carolina, on the 22d, and reached the New York Navy Yard on the 25th.

==== Battle of Mobile Bay ====
Recommissioned on April 14, 1864, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; put to sea on 10 May under the command of Capt. James Alden, Jr. and rejoined her squadron off Mobile Bay on the last day of the month. There Farragut—who had resumed command—was eager to capture that strategic port, but was held up by the perennial lack of available Union Army troops—needed for the projected combined operation. He was also awaiting the arrival of monitors to strengthen the squadron for the forthcoming battle. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; helped to blockade Mobile Bay while Farragut waited for deficiencies to be corrected. Finally, late in July she and her squadron mates received orders to make ready for the long awaited attack. On the morning of August 5, Farragut took his squadron of 18 ships, including four monitors, against the heavy Confederate defenses of Mobile Bay. Soon after 6 am, the Union ships crossed the bar and moved into the bay. The four monitors formed a column to starboard of the wooden ships in order to take most of the fire from Fort Morgan, which they had to pass at close range. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; led the second column, consisting of the seven smaller wooden ships lashed to the port side of the larger wooden screw steamers, as in the passage of Fort Hudson.

Shortly before 7 o&#x27;clock, &quot;Tecumseh&quot; opened fire on Fort Morgan, and the action quickly became general. As the 4-ship Confederate squadron engaged the attackers, a terrific explosion rocked the Union monitor . She careened violently and went down in seconds, the victim of one of the much-feared torpedoes (Naval mine) laid by the Confederates for harbor defense. Alden, in &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, was to &quot;Tecumseh&#x27;s&quot; port when the disaster occurred; the heavy steamer stopped and began backing to clear &quot;a row of suspecious looking buoys&quot; directly under &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s&quot; bow. The entire line of wooden vessels was drifting into confusion immediately under the guns of Fort Morgan. Farragut, lashed in the rigging to observe the action over the smoke billowing from the guns, acted promptly and resolutely. The only course was the boldest—through the torpedo field. &quot;Damn the torpedoes&quot;, he ordered &quot;full speed ahead.&quot; His flagship &quot;Hartford&quot; swept past &quot;Brooklyn&quot; into the rows of torpedoes; the fleet followed. The Union force steamed into the bay.

In the ensuing battle, the ironclad CSS &quot;Tennessee&quot; attempted in vain to ram &quot;Brooklyn&quot;. The Union fleet dispatched three of the Confederate ships, leaving &quot;Tennessee&quot; as the only defender. The lone ironclad then engaged the entire Union fleet. After a fierce battle lasting more than an hour, &quot;Tennessee&quot; was forced to surrender, resulting in a Union victory. During the battle that lasted a bit more than three hours, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; suffered 54 casualties, 11 killed and 43 wounded, while firing 183 projectiles. Twenty-three of &quot;Brooklyn&quot;&#x27;s sailors and marines were awarded the Medal of Honor for their part in the battle. Their names were:
* Ship&#x27;s Cook William Blagheen
* Captain of the Forecastle John Brown
* Landsman William H. Brown
* Coxswain John Laver Mather Cooper
* Ordinary Seaman Samuel W. Davis
* Sergeant J. Henry Denig (USMC)
* Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Richard Dennis
* Coxswain William Halstead
* Sergeant Michael Hudson (USMC)
* Seaman Joseph Irlam
* Coxswain John Irving
* Seaman Nicholas Irwin

* Quartermaster Barnett Kenna
* Boy James Machon
* Captain of the Top Alexander Mack
* Coal Heaver William Madden
* Engineer&#x27;s Cook James Mifflin
* Quartermaster William Nichols
* Corporal Miles M. Oviatt (USMC)
* Coxswain Edward Price
* Corporal Willard M. Smith (USMC)
* Coal Heaver James E. Sterling
* Quartermaster Samuel Todd
==== Attack on Fort Fisher ====

After spending the next few weeks helping reduce the Confederate land works guarding the entrance, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; departed Mobile Bay on September 6 and headed for Hampton Roads for service in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Soon thereafter, Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter began to concentrate his warships for a joint Army-Navy operation against Fort Fisher, North Carolina. The fort guarded the approaches to Wilmington, North Carolina, the last major Confederate port still open for blockade runners. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; took part in the attack against that Southern stronghold which began with a bombardment on Christmas Eve. She helped to cover the landing of troops the next day, but the whole effort was brought to naught later that day when the Union Army commanding officer, Major General Benjamin F. Butler, decided that his forces could not carry the Confederate works and ordered his soldiers to re-embark. Porter strongly disagreed with this decision in dispatches to Washington. General Ulysses S. Grant responded by placing a new commander over a larger Army force earmarked for another attempt to take Fort Fisher. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was in the task force that arrived off Fort Fisher on January 13, 1865, and her guns supported the attack until the fort surrendered on the 15th. Since this victory completed the last major task of the Union Navy during the Civil War, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; sailed north and was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on January 31, 1865.

=== Post-war service ===

Laid up under repairs for the remaining months of the conflict, the screw sloop was recommissioned on October 4, 1865, Comdr. Thomas H. Patterson in command. She stood out to sea on the 27th and proceeded via the Gulf of Mexico to Bahia, Brazil. Following almost two years of service along the Atlantic coast of South America, she returned to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, late in the summer of 1867 and was decommissioned there on September 11 and placed in ordinary. Recommissioned on August 24, 1870, Capt. John Guest in command, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; sailed eastward across the Atlantic and spent almost three years in European waters, primarily in the Mediterranean. After returning home in the summer of 1873, she was decommissioned at New York City. Reactivated on January 20, 1874, the veteran warship operated along the southern coast of the United States until autumn when she entered the Norfolk Navy Yard to be fitted out for service as flagship of the South Atlantic Squadron. She got underway for the coast of Brazil on January 23, 1875 and operated in South American waters protecting American interests until heading home on December 7. Following service in the Home Squadron, she was decommissioned at New York City on July 21, 1876 and laid up.

Recommissioned on November 11, 1881, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; sailed on December 7 for Montevideo, Uruguay, and another tour of duty with the South Atlantic Squadron. On February 5, 1882, she departed that port and headed for the Strait of Magellan. During the month, she visited Possession Bay, Gregory Bay, Elizabeth Island, and Sandy Point before departing Possession Bay on March 2, 1882 and returning via Stanley, Falkland Islands, to Montevideo where she arrived late in March. While operating out of that port during the next 18 months, she made two voyages to Santa Cruz, Patagonia, and one to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before getting underway on September 28, 1883 for Cape Town, Africa. During her time in African waters, she also visited Tomatave, Madagascar; Zanzibar; the Johanna Islands; Nassi be Island; Mojanga, Madagascar; Mozambique; Mourondava, Nos Veh, and Tuellear Bay, Madagascar, and Port Elizabeth, Africa, before departing Cape Town on March 13, 1884. After proceeding homeward via St. Helena Island, Montevideo, and Rio de Janeiro, she arrived at New York City on October 8, 1884 and was placed out of commission there on the 25th.

Following almost a year in ordinary, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was recommissioned on October 15, 1885 and, on November 21, assigned once more to the South Atlantic Squadron and served in South American waters until heading home again on June 9, 1886. At New York, she prepared for duty in the Orient and, on August 12, got underway for the Far East. After crossing the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, she transited the Suez Canal and traversed the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean to East Asian waters. On April 4, 1887, Rear Admiral Chandler transferred his flag to her as commander of the Asiatic Squadron, and she showed the flag in ports of the western Pacific Ocean until turning homeward for the last time on August 9, 1888. She returned to the United States via Honolulu; Cape Horn; and St. Thomas. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; completed her first circumnavigation of the earth upon her arrival at New York on April 24, 1889 and simultaneously ended her active naval career. She was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on May 14, 1889, and her name was struck from the Navy List on January 6, 1890. She was sold by public auction at the Norfolk Navy Yard on March 25, 1891 to E. J. Butler.

<doc id="195749" wikidata="Q4683179" url="?curid=195749" title="Adjournment debate">
<text>In the Westminster system, an adjournment debate is a debate on the motion, &quot;That this House do now adjourn.&quot; In practice, this is a way of enabling the House to have a debate on a subject without considering a substantive motion.

== Types of debate ==
There are generally two types of adjournment debate: those proposed by the government, which are used from time to time to permit general debates on topical subjects (e.g. flooding and coastal defenses, regional affairs or International Women&#x27;s Day); and the half-hour adjournment at the end of each day&#x27;s sitting. The half-hour adjournment is an opportunity for a backbench Member of Parliament to raise a subject of their choosing, of which advance notice has been given, with the appropriate government minister. Normally, only the member raising the debate and the minister who is replying speak in the half-hour adjournment. It is not uncommon for the chamber otherwise to be empty.

The convention is that any subject may be raised on a motion for the adjournment, since any matter of national or local importance may offer a good reason for the House to continue sitting (i.e. the House should not adjourn until it has considered the topic in hand).

It is not usual for the House to vote on the adjournment motion; it is either agreed to without a vote, or it lapses once the allotted time has expired. On rare occasions, however, where the debate concerns a matter on which there are strong differences of opinion (such as the prospect of going to war), backbench members may engineer a vote. It was a vote on a motion for the adjournment which brought down British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s government during World War II – the so-called Norway Debate. Though Chamberlain won the vote (with the Government voting &#x27;Aye&#x27;, their opponents &#x27;No&#x27;), his government&#x27;s majority was considerably reduced to the point that his credibility was fatally undermined and he felt obliged to resign two days later.

In the House of Commons of Canada, coming as it does at the end of the sitting day, the adjournment debate is colloquially known as the &quot;late show.&quot;

<doc id="195752" wikidata="Q221836" url="?curid=195752" title="Flash (photography)">
<text>A flash is a device used in photography that produces a brief burst of light (lasting around of a second) at a color temperature of about 5500 K to help illuminate a scene. The main purpose of a flash is to illuminate a dark scene. Other uses are capturing quickly moving objects or changing the quality of light. &quot;Flash&quot; refers either to the flash of light itself or to the electronic flash unit discharging the light. Most current flash units are electronic, having evolved from single-use flashbulbs and flammable powders. Modern cameras often activate flash units automatically.

Flash units are commonly built directly into a camera. Some cameras allow separate flash units to be mounted via a standardized accessory mount bracket (a &quot;hot shoe&quot;). In professional studio equipment, flashes may be large, standalone units, or studio strobes, powered by special battery packs or connected to mains power. They are either synchronized with the camera using a flash synchronization cable or radio signal, or are light-triggered, meaning that only one flash unit needs to be synchronized with the camera, and in turn triggers the other units, called &quot;slaves&quot;.

==Types==

===Flash-lamp/Flash powder===
Studies of magnesium by Bunsen and Roscoe in 1859 showed that burning this metal produced a light with similar qualities to daylight. The potential application to photography inspired Edward Sonstadt to investigate methods of manufacturing magnesium so that it would burn reliably for this use. He applied for patents in 1862 and by 1864 had started the Manchester Magnesium Company with Edward Mellor. With the help of engineer William Mather, who was also a director of the company, they produced flat magnesium ribbon, which was said to burn more consistently and completely so giving better illumination than round wire. It also had the benefit of being a simpler and cheaper process than making round wire. Mather was also credited with the invention of a holder for the ribbon, which formed a lamp to burn it in. A variety of magnesium ribbon holders were produced by other manufacturers, such as the Pistol Flashmeter, which incorporated an inscribed ruler that allowed the photographer to use the correct length of ribbon for the exposure they needed. The packaging also implies that the magnesium ribbon was not necessarily broken off before being ignited.
An alternative to magnesium ribbon was flash powder, a mixture of magnesium powder and potassium chlorate, was introduced by its German inventors Adolf Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke in 1887. A measured amount was put into a pan or trough and ignited by hand, producing a brief brilliant flash of light, along with the smoke and noise that might be expected from such an explosive event. This could be a life-threatening activity, especially if the flash powder was damp. An electrically triggered flash lamp was invented by Joshua Lionel Cowen in 1899. His patent describes a device for igniting photographers&#x27; flash powder by using dry cell batteries to heat a wire fuse. Variations and alternatives were touted from time to time and a few found a measure of success, especially for amateur use. In 1905, one French photographer was using intense non-explosive flashes produced by a special mechanized carbon arc lamp to photograph subjects in his studio, but more portable and less expensive devices prevailed. On through the 1920s, flash photography normally meant a professional photographer sprinkling powder into the trough of a T-shaped flash lamp, holding it aloft, then triggering a brief and (usually) harmless bit of pyrotechnics.

===Flashbulbs===
The use of flash powder in an open lamp was replaced by &quot;flashbulbs&quot;; magnesium filaments were contained in bulbs filled with oxygen gas, and electrically ignited by a contact in the camera shutter. Manufactured flashbulbs were first produced commercially in Germany in 1929. Such a bulb could only be used once, and was too hot to handle immediately after use, but the confinement of what would otherwise have amounted to a small explosion was an important advance. A later innovation was the coating of flashbulbs with a plastic film to maintain bulb integrity in the event of the glass shattering during the flash. A blue plastic film was introduced as an option to match the spectral quality of the flash to daylight-balanced colour film. Subsequently, the magnesium was replaced by zirconium, which produced a brighter flash.

There was a significant delay after ignition for a flashbulb to reach full brightness, and the bulb burned for a relatively long time, compared to shutter speeds required to stop motion and not display camera shake. Slower shutter speeds (typically from to of a second) were initially used on cameras to ensure proper synchronization and to make use of all the bulb&#x27;s light output. Cameras with flash sync triggered the flashbulb a fraction of a second before opening the shutter to allow it to reach full brightness, allowing faster shutter speeds. A flashbulb widely used during the 1960s was the Press 25, the flashbulb often used by newspapermen in period movies, usually attached to a press camera or a twin-lens reflex camera. Its peak light output was around a million lumens. Other flashbulbs in common use were the M-series, M-2, M-3 etc., which had a small (&quot;miniature&quot;) metal bayonet base fused to the glass bulb. The largest flashbulb ever produced was the GE Mazda No. 75, being over eight inches long with a girth of 4 inches, initially developed for nighttime aerial photography during World War II.

The all-glass PF1 bulb was introduced in 1954. Eliminating the metal base and the multiple manufacturing steps needed to attach it to the glass bulb cut the cost substantially compared to the larger M series bulbs. The design required a fibre ring around the base to hold the contact wires against the side of the glass base. An adapter was available allowing the bulb to fit into flash guns made for bayonet-capped bulbs. The PF1 (along with the M2) had a faster ignition time (less delay between shutter contact and peak output), so it could be used with X synch below of a second—while most bulbs require a shutter speed of on X synch to keep the shutter open long enough for the bulb to ignite and burn. A smaller version which was not as bright but did not require the fibre ring, the AG-1, was introduced in 1958; it was cheaper, and rapidly supplanted the PF1.


====Flashcubes, Magicubes and Flipflash====

In 1965 Eastman Kodak of Rochester, New York replaced the individual flashbulb technology used on early Instamatic cameras with the &quot;Flashcube&quot; developed by Sylvania Electric Products.

A flashcube was a module with four expendable flashbulbs, each mounted at 90° from the others in its own reflector. For use it was mounted atop the camera with an electrical connection to the shutter release and a battery inside the camera. After each flash exposure, the film advance mechanism also rotated the flashcube 90° to a fresh bulb. This arrangement allowed the user to take four images in rapid succession before inserting a new flashcube.

The later Magicube (or X-Cube) by General Electric retained the four-bulb format, but did not require electrical power. It was not interchangeable with the original Flashcube. Each bulb in a Magicube was set off by releasing one of four cocked wire springs within the cube. The spring struck a primer tube at the base of the bulb, which contained a fulminate, which in turn ignited shredded zirconium foil in the flash. A Magicube could also be fired using a key or paper clip to trip the spring manually. &quot;X-cube&quot; was an alternate name for Magicubes, indicating the appearance of the camera&#x27;s socket.

Other common flashbulb-based devices were the Flashbar and Flipflash, which provided ten flashes from a single unit. The bulbs in a Flipflash were set in a vertical array, putting a distance between the bulb and the lens, eliminating red eye. The Flipflash name derived from the fact that once half the flashbulbs had been used, the unit had to be flipped over and re-inserted to use the remaining bulbs. In many Flipflash cameras, the bulbs were ignited by electrical currents produced when a piezoelectric crystal was struck mechanically by a spring-loaded striker, which was cocked each time the film was advanced.

===Electronic flash===
The electronic flash tube was introduced by Harold Eugene Edgerton in 1931. The electronic flash reaches full brightness almost instantaneously, and is of very short duration. Edgerton took advantage of the short duration to make several iconic photographs, such as one of a bullet bursting through an apple. The large photographic company Kodak was initially reluctant to take up the idea. Electronic flash, often called &quot;strobe&quot; in the US following Edgerton&#x27;s use of the technique for stroboscopy, came into some use in the late 1950s, although flashbulbs remained dominant in amateur photography until the mid 1970s. Early units were expensive, and often large and heavy; the power unit was separate from the flash head and was powered by a large lead-acid battery carried with a shoulder strap. Towards the end of the 1960s electronic flashguns of similar size to conventional bulb guns became available; the price, although it had dropped, was still high. The electronic flash system eventually superseded bulb guns as prices came down. Already in the early 1970s, amateur electronic flashes were available for less than $100.
A typical electronic flash unit has electronic circuitry to charge a high-capacitance capacitor to several hundred volts. When the flash is triggered by the shutter&#x27;s flash synchronization contact, the capacitor is discharged rapidly through a permanent flash tube, producing an immediate flash lasting typically less than of a second, shorter than shutter speeds used, with full brightness before the shutter has started to close, allowing easy synchronization of maximum shutter opening with full flash brightness, unlike flashbulbs which were slower to reach full brightness and burned for a longer time, typically of a second.

A single electronic flash unit is often mounted on a camera&#x27;s accessory shoe or a bracket; many inexpensive cameras have an electronic flash unit built in. For more sophisticated and longer-range lighting several synchronised flash units at different positions may be used.

Ring flashes that fit to a camera&#x27;s lens can be used for shadow free portrait and macro photography; some lenses have built-in ring-flash.

In a photographic studio, more powerful and flexible studio flash systems are used. They usually contain a modelling light, a lamp close to the flash tube; the continuous illumination of the modelling light lets the photographer visualize the effect of the flash. LED lamps are replacing the previous incandescent light bulbs in new designs, modelling lights typically being proportionately variable to flash power require dimmable LEDs and suitable circuitry in the head. Multiple flashes may be synchronised for multi-source lighting.

The strength of a flash device is often indicated in terms of a guide number designed to simplify exposure setting. The energy released by larger studio flash units, such as monolights, is indicated in watt-seconds.

Canon names its electronic flash units Speedlite, and Nikon uses Speedlight; these terms are frequently used as generic terms for electronic flash units designed to be mounted on, and triggered by, a camera hot shoe.

===High speed flash===

An air-gap flash is a high-voltage device that discharges a flash of light with an exceptionally short duration, often much less than one microsecond. These are commonly used by scientists or engineers for examining extremely fast-moving objects or reactions, famous for producing images of bullets tearing through light bulbs and balloons (see Harold Eugene Edgerton). An example of a process by which to create a high speed flash is the exploding wire method.

===Multi-flash===
A camera that implements multiple flashes can be used to find depth edges or create stylized images. Such a camera has been developed by researchers at the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL). Successive flashing of strategically placed flash mechanisms results in shadows along the depths of the scene. This information can be manipulated to suppress or enhance details or capture the intricate geometric features of a scene (even those hidden from the eye), to create a non-photorealistic image form. Such images could be useful in technical or medical imaging.

===Flash intensity===
Unlike flashbulbs, the intensity of an electronic flash can be adjusted on some units. To do this, smaller flash units typically vary the capacitor discharge time, whereas larger (e.g., higher power, studio) units typically vary the capacitor charge. Color temperature can change as a result of varying the capacitor charge, making color correction necessary. Constant-color-temperature flash can be achieved by using appropriate circuitry.

Flash intensity is typically measured in stops or in fractions (1, , , etc.). Some monolights display an &quot;EV Number&quot;, so that a photographer can know the difference in brightness between different flash units with different watt-second ratings. EV10.0 is defined as 6400 watt-seconds, and EV9.0 is one stop lower, i.e. 3200 watt-seconds.

===Flash duration===
Flash duration is commonly described by two numbers that are expressed in fractions of a second:
* t0.1 is the length of time the light intensity is above 0.1 (10%) of the peak intensity
* t0.5 is the length of time the light intensity is above 0.5 (50%) of the peak intensity
For example, a single flash event might have a t0.5 value of and t0.1 of . These values determine the ability of a flash to &quot;freeze&quot; moving subjects in applications such as sports photography.

In cases where intensity is controlled by capacitor discharge time, t0.5 and t0.1 decrease with decreasing intensity. Conversely, in cases where intensity is controlled by capacitor charge, t0.5 and t0.1 increase with decreasing intensity due to the non-linearity of the capacitor&#x27;s discharge curve.

===Flash LED used in phones===

High-current flash LEDs are used as flash sources in camera phones, although they are less bright than xenon flash tubes. Unlike xenon tubes, LEDs require only a low voltage, eliminating the need of a high-voltage capacitor. They are more energy-efficient, and very small. The LED flash can also be used for illumination of video recordings or as an autofocus assist lamp in low-light photography; it can also be used as a general-purpose non-photographic light source.

===Focal-plane-shutter synchronization===
Electronic flash units have shutter speed limits with focal-plane shutters. Focal-plane shutters expose using two curtains that cross the sensor. The first one opens and the second curtain follows it after a delay equal to the nominal shutter speed. A typical modern focal-plane shutter on a full-frame or smaller sensor camera takes about s to s to cross the sensor, so at exposure times shorter than this only part of the sensor is uncovered at any one time.

The time available to fire a single flash which uniformly illuminates the image recorded on the sensor is the exposure time minus the shutter travel time. Equivalently, the minimum possible exposure time is the shutter travel time plus the flash duration (plus any delays in triggering the flash).

For example, a Nikon D850 has a shutter travel time of about 2.4 ms. A full-power flash from a modern built-in or hot shoe mounted electronic flash has a typical duration of about 1ms, or a little less, so the minimum possible exposure time for even exposure across the sensor with a full-power flash is about 2.4 ms + 1.0 ms = 3.4 ms, corresponding to a shutter speed of about s. However some time is required to trigger the flash. At the maximum (standard) D850 X-sync shutter speed of s, the exposure time is s = 4.0 ms, so about 4.0 ms − 2.4 ms = 1.6 ms are available to trigger and fire the flash, and with a 1 ms flash duration, 1.6 ms − 1.0 ms = 0.6 ms are available to trigger the flash in this Nikon D850 example.

Mid- to high-end Nikon DSLRs with a maximum shutter speed of s (roughly D7000 or D800 and above) have an unusual menu-selectable feature which increases the maximum X-Sync speed to s = 3.1 ms with some electronic flashes. At s only 3.1 ms − 2.4 ms = 0.7 ms are available to trigger and fire the flash while achieving a uniform flash exposure, so the maximum flash duration, and therefore maximum flash output, must be, and is, reduced.

Contemporary (2018) focal-plane shutter cameras with full-frame or smaller sensors typically have maximum normal X-sync speeds of s or s. Some cameras are limited to s. X-sync speeds for medium format cameras when using focal-plane shutters are somewhat slower, e.g. s, because of the greater shutter travel time required for a wider, heavier, shutter that travels farther across a larger sensor.

In the past, slow-burning single-use flash bulbs allowed the use of focal-plane shutters at maximum speed because they produced continuous light for the time taken for the exposing slit to cross the film gate. If these are found they cannot be used on modern cameras because the bulb must be fired *before* the first shutter curtain begins to move (M-sync); the X-sync used for electronic flash normally fires only when the first shutter curtain reaches the end of its travel.

High-end flash units address this problem by offering a mode, typically called FP sync or HSS (High Speed Sync), which fires the flash tube multiple times during the time the slit traverses the sensor. Such units require communication with the camera and are thus dedicated to a particular camera make. The multiple flashes result in a significant decrease in guide number, since each is only a part of the total flash power, but it is all that illuminates any particular part of the sensor. In general, if s is the shutter speed, and t is the shutter traverse time, the guide number reduces by . For example, if the guide number is 100, and the shutter traverse time is 5 ms (a shutter speed of 1/200s), and the shutter speed is set to s (0.5 ms), the guide number reduces by a factor of , or about 3.16, so the resultant guide number at this speed would be about 32.

Current (2010) flash units frequently have much lower guide numbers in HSS mode than in normal modes, even at speeds below the shutter traverse time. For example, the Mecablitz 58 AF-1 digital flash unit has a guide number of 58 in normal operation, but only 20 in HSS mode, even at low speeds.

==Technique==
As well as dedicated studio use, flash may be used as the main light source where ambient light is inadequate, or as a supplementary source in more complex lighting situations. Basic flash lighting produces a hard, frontal light unless modified in some way. Several techniques are used to soften light from the flash or provide other effects.

Softboxes, diffusers that cover the flash lamp, scatter direct light and reduce its harshness. Reflectors, including umbrellas, flat-white backgrounds, drapes and reflector cards are commonly used for this purpose (even with small hand-held flash units). Bounce flash is a related technique in which flash is directed onto a reflective surface, for example a white ceiling or a flash umbrella, which then reflects light onto the subject. It can be used as fill-flash or, if used indoors, as ambient lighting for the whole scene. Bouncing creates softer, less artificial-looking illumination than direct flash, often reducing overall contrast and expanding shadow and highlight detail, and typically requires more flash power than direct lighting. Part of the bounced light can be also aimed directly on the subject by &quot;bounce cards&quot; attached to the flash unit which increase the efficiency of the flash and illuminate shadows cast by light coming from the ceiling. It is also possible to use one&#x27;s own palm for that purpose, resulting in warmer tones on the picture, as well as eliminating the need to carry additional accessories.

Fill flash or &quot;fill-in flash&quot; describes flash used to supplement ambient light in order to illuminate a subject close to the camera that would otherwise be in shade relative to the rest of the scene. The flash unit is set to expose the subject correctly at a given aperture, while shutter speed is calculated to correctly expose for the background or ambient light at that aperture setting. Secondary or slave flash units may be synchronized to the master unit to provide light from additional directions. The slave units are electrically triggered by the light from the master flash. Many small flashes and studio monolights have optical slaves built in. Wireless radio transmitters, such as PocketWizards, allow the receiver unit to be around a corner, or at a distance too far to trigger using an optical sync.

To strobe, some high end units can be set to flash a specified number of times at a specified frequency. This allows action to be frozen multiple times in a single exposure.

Colored gels can also be used to change the color of the flash. Correction gels are commonly used, so that the light of the flash is the same as tungsten lights (using a CTO gel) or fluorescent lights.

Open flash, free flash or manually-triggered flash refers to modes in which the photographer manually triggers the flash unit to fire independently of the shutter.

==Drawbacks==
Using on-camera flash will give a very harsh light, which results in a loss of shadows in the image, because the only lightsource is in practically the same place as the camera. Balancing the flash power and ambient lighting or using off-camera flash can help overcome these issues. Using an umbrella or softbox (the flash will have to be off-camera for this) makes softer shadows.

A typical problem with cameras using built-in flash units is the low intensity of the flash; the level of light produced will often not suffice for good pictures at distances of over or so. Dark, murky pictures with excessive image noise or &quot;grain&quot; will result. In order to get good flash pictures with simple cameras, it is important not to exceed the recommended distance for flash pictures. Larger flashes, especially studio units and monoblocks, have sufficient power for larger distances, even through an umbrella, and can even be used against sunlight at short distances. Cameras which automatically flash in low light conditions often do not take into account the distance to the subject, causing them to fire even when the subject is several tens of metres away and unaffected by the flash. In crowds at sports matches, concerts and so on, the stands or the auditorium can be a constant sea of flashes, resulting in distraction to the performers or players and providing absolutely no benefit to the photographers.

The &quot;red-eye effect&quot; is another problem with on camera and ring flash units. Since the retina of the human eye reflects red light straight back in the direction it came from, pictures taken from straight in front of a face often exhibit this effect. It can be somewhat reduced by using the &quot;red eye reduction&quot; found on many cameras (a pre-flash that makes the subject&#x27;s irises contract). However, very good results can be obtained only with a flash unit that is separated from the camera, sufficiently far from the optical axis, or by using bounce flash, where the flash head is angled to bounce light off a wall, ceiling or reflector. 

On some cameras the flash exposure measuring logic fires a pre-flash very quickly before the real flash. In some camera/people combinations this will lead to shut eyes in every picture taken. The blink response time seems to be around of a second. If the exposure flash is fired at approximately this interval after the TTL measuring flash, people will be squinting or have their eyes shut. One solution may be the FEL (flash exposure lock) offered on some more expensive cameras, which allows the photographer to fire the measuring flash at some earlier time, long (many seconds) before taking the real picture. Many camera manufacturers do not make the TTL pre-flash interval configurable.

Flash distracts people, limiting the number of pictures that can be taken without irritating them. Photographing with flash may not be permitted in some museums even after purchasing a permit for taking pictures. Flash equipment may take some time to set up, and like any grip equipment, may need to be carefully secured, especially if hanging overhead, so it does not fall on anyone. A small breeze can easily topple a flash with an umbrella on a lightstand if it is not tied down or sandbagged. Larger equipment (e.g., monoblocks) will need a supply of AC power.

<text>The Purépecha ( ) are a group of Indigenous people centered in the northwestern region of Michoacán, Mexico, mainly in the area of the cities of Cherán and Pátzcuaro.

They are also known by the derogatory term &quot;Tarascan&quot;, an exonym, applied by outsiders and not one they use for themselves.

The Purépecha occupied most of Michoacán but also some of the lower valleys of both Guanajuato and Jalisco. Celaya, Acambaro, Cerano, and Yurirapundaro. Now, the Purépecha live mostly in the highlands of central Michoacán, around Lakes Patzcuaro and Cuitzeo.

==History==
===Prehispanic history===

It was one of the major empires of the Pre-Columbian era. The capital city was Tzintzuntzan. Purépecha architecture is noted for step pyramids in the shape of the letter &quot;T&quot;. Pre-Columbian Purépecha artisans made feather mosaics that extensively used hummingbird feathers, which were highly regarded as luxury goods throughout the region.

During the Pre-Colonial era, the Purépecha kingdom engaged in conflict with the Aztecs. The Purépecha kingdom expanded through conquest. However, many avoided conquest and bloodshed and, in order to maintain their freedom, exchanged goods and resources such as metal with the Purépecha kingdom.

The Purépecha empire was never conquered by the Aztec Empire, in fact there is no record of the Aztecs ever defeating them in battle. This was most likely due to the presence of metal ores within their empire, and their knowledge of metallurgy, which was far superior to that of the Aztecs ; such skills have persisted in their descendants and are still widely regarded today, particularly their coppersmithing. Even though they were enemies with the Aztecs, the Aztecs still traded with them, mainly for metal tools and weapons.

=== Spanish era (1525-1821) ===

After hearing of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and having the native population much diminished by an epidemic of smallpox, the &quot;cazonci&quot; Tangaxuan II pledged his allegiance as a vassal of the King of Spain without a fight in 1525. It is believed that the Spanish conquistador Cristóbal de Olid, upon arriving in the Purépecha Empire, now in present-day Michoacán, explored some parts of Guanajuato in the early 1520s. A legend relates of a 16- or 17-year-old Purépecha, Princess Eréndira, who led her people into a fierce war against the Spanish. Using stolen Spanish horses, her people learned to ride into battle. In 1529 to 1530, the Spanish forces entered Michoacán and some parts of Guanajuato with an army of 500 Spanish soldiers and more than 10,000 Native warriors.

In 1530, the president of the Real Audiencia, Nuño de Guzmán, a conquistador notorious for his ruthlessness and brutality towards the natives, plundered the region and executed Tangaxuan II, destroying the Purépecha State and provoking a chaotic situation and widespread violence. In 1533, the Crown sent an experienced &quot;Oidor&quot; (Judge of the Audiencia) and later bishop, Don Vasco de Quiroga, who established a lasting colonial rule. The lands of the Purépecha were subjected to serious deforestation during the Spanish Colonial period.

===Post-independence history===
====Cárdenas era====
Following the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), Michoacán experienced political unrest. When former revolutionary general Lázaro Cárdenas, originally from a small town in Michoacán, was appointed governor of his state, he began an ambitious program of reform and economic development, which he continued when he became president of Mexico (1934–40). For him, the indigenous heritage of Michoacán was foundational for the construction of Mexico&#x27;s post-revolutionary identity. Although the Aztecs loomed large in Mexican history and the construction of identity, Cárdenas saw the Purépecha as &quot;purer&quot; source. The Purépecha had never been conquered by the Aztecs, but in the era of the Spanish conquest, the resistance of the Purépecha was a point of regional pride. In particular, Cárdenas promoted the story of Princess Eréndira who is said to have fought against the Spanish. He named the house he built in Pátzcuaro &quot;La Quinta Eréndira&quot; and commissioned muralists to depict Purépecha history in his residence and elsewhere. Purépecha traditions of folkloric performance became a source of &quot;indigenista&quot; pride.
====Emigration from Michoacán====
In the late twentieth and early twenty-first century social scientists have studied Purépecha emigration from the region.

==Religion==

Many traditions live on, including the &quot;Jimbani Uexurhina&quot; (New Fire), which is celebrated on February 2. It has both traditional indigenous and Catholic elements. The community lights a fire, called the &quot;chijpiri jimbani&quot; or &quot;new fire,&quot; as part of a ceremony that honors the four elements. Mass is also celebrated in the Purhépecha language. They believed in God of the sky, earth, and underworld. The God of the sky and war, Kurikaweri. The Goddess of earth, controlling life and climate, Kweawaperi. The Goddess of the sea and the underworld, Xaratenga.

== Culture ==
The Purépecha are mainly fishers because they mainly lived around the Patzcuaro lakes. They are also known for their skill in weaving, pottery and their skill in battle. Many live in wooden cabins within compounds surrounded by dry-stone walls. However, many of these structures are being replaced with homes made out of brick and concrete. One distinctive practice of the Purépecha include the baptism of newborns after forty days of separate rest for the mother and child. The infant is then swaddled for six weeks and kept in physical contact with the mother or a close female relative. Temples created by Purépecha did not look like their Mesoamerican counterparts.

Purépecha today celebrate many holidays. One of the most popular holidays celebrated by the Purépecha is the Day Of The Dead or &quot;Día De Los Muertos&quot; . While it is celebrated throughout Mexico in the same way, Purépechans celebrate slightly differently. On November 1 and 2, family members take part in all-night vigils at the graves of their loved ones. Purépecha believe that the souls of the dead watch over their living relatives on the Day of the Dead.

In the town of San Juan Nuevo Parangaricutiro, which is a Purépecha town, unmarried men will dance the Dance of the Cúrpites. The dance is used to help the man express their masculinity and court their sweetheart. The dance is celebrated during the Christian holiday of Epiphany.

==Language==
The Purépecha language is spoken by nearly 200,000 people in Michoacán. Since Mexico&#x27;s 2000 indigenous language law, indigenous languages like Purépecha were granted official status equal with Spanish in the areas in which they are spoken. Recently, educational instruction in Purépecha has been introduced in the local school systems. Additionally, many Purépecha communities offer classes and lessons in the language.

==In popular culture==
Princess Eréndira of the Purépecha was depicted in the 2006 film &quot;Erendira Ikikunari&quot; (&quot;Erendira the Untamable&quot;).

The 2017 Disney film, &quot;Coco&quot; presents a character named “Mama Coco”, who was apparently based on the real Purépecha woman María Salud Ramírez Caballero, although it was never officially confirmed by Pixar.

The 2022 film, &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot;, introduces Namor, whose mythos is rewritten to include an indigenous Meso American background with influences from Mayan and Aztec culture. Tenoch Huerta, who portrays Namor, comes from a Purépecha background.

The 2024 film, &quot;The Casagrandes Movie&quot;, based on the Nickelodeon animated series &quot;The Casagrandes&quot;, has lead protagonist Ronnie Anne Santiago travel with her family to the fictional city of Japunda, which is largely based on the real-life Michoacán town of Pátzcuaro. The movie draws inspiration from director Miguel Puga&#x27;s Purépecha heritage, and the director, along with cultural consultant Lalo Alcaraz, worked &quot;to portray the P’urhépecha community in this universe — their customs, their food, their music.&quot;

<doc id="195759" wikidata="Q7104" url="?curid=195759" title="Baron d'Holbach">
<text>Paul-Henri Thiry, Baron d&#x27;Holbach (; 8 December 1723 – 21 January 1789), known as d&#x27;Holbach, was a Franco-German philosopher, encyclopedist and writer, who was a prominent figure in the French Enlightenment. He was born Paul Heinrich Dietrich in Edesheim, near Landau in the Rhenish Palatinate, but lived and worked mainly in Paris, where he kept a &quot;salon&quot;. He helped in the dissemination of &quot;Protestant and especially German thought&quot;, particularly in the field of the sciences, but was best known for his atheism, and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being &quot;The System of Nature&quot; (1770) and &quot;The Universal Morality&quot; (1776).

==Biography==


Sources differ regarding d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s dates of birth and death. His exact birthday is unknown, although records show that he was baptised on 8 December 1723. Some authorities incorrectly give June 1789 as the month of his death. D&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s mother, Catherine Jacobina (&quot;née&quot; Holbach; 1684–1743), was the daughter of Johannes Jacobus Holbach (died 1723). His father, Johann Jakob Dietrich (with other notations: ger.: &quot;Johann Jakob Dirre&quot;; fr.: &quot;Jean-Jacques Thiry&quot;; 1672–1756), was a wine-grower.

D&#x27;Holbach wrote nothing of his childhood, although it is known he was raised in Paris by his uncle Franz Adam Holbach (or &quot;Adam François d&#x27;Holbach&quot; or &quot;Messire François-Adam, Baron d&#x27;Holbach, Seigneur de Heeze, Leende et autres Lieux&quot;) (approx. 1675–1753), who had become a millionaire by speculating on the Paris stock-exchange. With his financial support, d&#x27;Holbach attended Leiden University from 1744 to 1748, where he became a friend of John Wilkes. In 1750, he married his second cousin, Basile-Geneviève d&#x27;Aine (1728–1754), and in 1753 a son was born to them, Francois Nicholas, who left France before his father died. In 1753 both d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s uncle and father died, leaving him with an enormous inheritance, including Heeze Castle, &quot;Kasteel Heeze te Heeze&quot;.

D&#x27;Holbach remained wealthy throughout his life. In 1754, his wife died from an unknown disease. The distraught d&#x27;Holbach moved to the provinces for a brief period with his friend Baron Grimm and in the following year received a special dispensation from the Pope to marry his deceased wife&#x27;s sister, Charlotte-Suzanne d&#x27;Aine (1733–1814). They had a son, Charles-Marius (1757–1832), and two daughters, Amélie-Suzanne (13 January 1759) and Louise-Pauline (19 December 1759 – 1830).

During the summer months, when Paris was hot and humid, Baron d&#x27;Holbach retreated to his country estate at Grandval, &quot;Le Château de Grand-Val&quot; (Sucy-en-Brie today &quot;N° 27 rue du Grand-Val&quot; on the outskirts of Paris (Département Val-de-Marne). There he would invite friends to stay for a few days or weeks, and every year he invited Denis Diderot whom he joined at an Anglican chapel service at the opening of the English Embassy led by Laurence Sterne.

D&#x27;Holbach was known for his generosity, often providing financial support discreetly or anonymously to his friends, amongst them Diderot. It is thought that the virtuous atheist Wolmar in Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse&quot; is based on d&#x27;Holbach. Holbach died in Paris on 21 January 1789, a few months before the French Revolution. The authorship of his various anti-religious works did not become widely known until the early 19th century. Ironically, he was buried in the Church of Saint-Roch, Paris. The exact location of the grave is unknown.

==D&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s salon==

From c. 1750 to c. 1790, Baron d&#x27;Holbach used his wealth to maintain one of the more notable and lavish Parisian &quot;salons&quot;, which soon became an important meeting place for the contributors to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

Meetings were held regularly twice a week, on Sundays and Thursdays, in d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s home in rue Royale. Visitors to the salon were exclusively males, and the tone of discussion highbrow, often extending to topics more extensive than those of other salons. This, along with the excellent food, expensive wine, and a library of over 3000 volumes, attracted many notable visitors. Among the regulars in attendance at the salon—the &quot;coterie holbachique&quot;—were the following: Diderot, Grimm, Condillac, Condorcet, D&#x27;Alembert, Marmontel, Turgot, La Condamine, Raynal, Helvétius, Galiani, Morellet, Naigeon and, for a time, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The salon was also visited by prominent British intellectuals, amongst them Adam Smith, David Hume, John Wilkes, Horace Walpole, Edward Gibbon, David Garrick, Laurence Sterne; the Italian Cesare Beccaria; and the American Benjamin Franklin.

Morellet, a regular attendee at D&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s salon, described it as:

In a frequently narrated story about a discussion that had taken place in D&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s salon, David Hume had questioned whether atheists actually existed whereupon D&#x27;Holbach had clarified that Hume was sitting at a table with seventeen atheists.

==Writings==

===Contributions to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;===

For the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; d&#x27;Holbach authored and translated a large number of articles on topics ranging from politics and religion to chemistry and mineralogy. As a German who had become a naturalised Frenchman, he undertook the translation of many contemporary German works of natural philosophy into French. Between 1751 and 1765, D&#x27;Holbach contributed some four hundred articles to the project, mostly on scientific subjects, in addition to serving as the editor of several volumes on natural philosophy. D&#x27;Holbach might also have written several disparaging entries on non-Christian religions, intended as veiled criticisms of Christianity itself.

===Anti-religious works===
Despite his extensive contributions to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, d&#x27;Holbach is better known today for his philosophical writings, all of which were published anonymously or under pseudonyms and printed outside France, usually in Amsterdam by Marc-Michel Rey. His philosophy was expressly materialistic and atheistic and is today categorised into the philosophical movement called French materialism. In 1761 &quot;Christianisme dévoilé&quot; (&quot;Christianity Unveiled&quot;) appeared, in which he attacked Christianity and religion in general as an impediment to the moral advancement of humanity. The deistic Voltaire, denying authorship of the work, made known his aversion to d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s philosophy, writing that &quot;[the work] is entirely opposed to my principles. This book leads to an atheistic philosophy that I detest.&quot; &quot;Christianity Unveiled&quot; was followed by others, notably &quot;La Contagion sacrée&quot;, &quot;Théologie portative&quot;, and &quot;Essai sur les préjugés&quot;. D&#x27;Holbach was helped in these endeavours by Jacques-André Naigeon, who would later become his literary executor.

===&quot;The System of Nature&quot;===
In 1770, d&#x27;Holbach published his most famous book, &quot;The System of Nature&quot; (&quot;Le Système de la nature&quot;), under the name of Jean-Baptiste de Mirabaud, the secretary of the Académie who had died ten years previously. Denying the existence of a deity, and refusing to admit as evidence all &quot;a priori&quot; arguments, d&#x27;Holbach saw the universe as nothing more than matter in motion, bound by inexorable natural laws of cause and effect. &quot;There is&quot;, he wrote, &quot;no necessity to have recourse to supernatural powers to account for the formation of things.&quot;

&quot;The System of Nature&quot; is a long and extensive work presenting a thoroughly naturalistic view of the world. Some d&#x27;Holbach scholars have pointed out that Denis Diderot was a close friend of d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s, and that it is unclear to what extent d&#x27;Holbach was influenced by him. Indeed, Diderot may have been the author of parts of the &quot;System of Nature&quot;. Regardless, however, of the extent of Diderot&#x27;s contribution to the &quot;System of Nature&quot;, it is on the basis of this work that d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s philosophy has been called &quot;the culmination of French materialism and atheism&quot;.

D&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s objectives in challenging religion were primarily moral: he saw the institutions of Christianity as a major obstacle to the improvement of society. For him, the foundation of morality was to be sought not in Scripture or the moral teachings of the Catholic Church, but in happiness: &quot;It would be useless and almost unjust to insist upon a man&#x27;s being virtuous if he cannot be so without being unhappy. So long as vice renders him happy, he should love vice.&quot; D&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s radicalism posited that humans were fundamentally motivated by the pursuit of enlightened self-interest, which is what he meant by &quot;society&quot;, rather than by empty and selfish gratification of purely individual needs. Chapter 15 of Part I of &quot;System of Nature&quot; is titled &quot;Of Man&#x27;s true Interest, or of the Ideas he forms to himself of Happiness. – Man cannot be happy without Virtue.&quot;


The explicitly atheistic and materialistic &quot;The System of Nature&quot; presented a core of radical ideas which many contemporaries, both churchmen and &quot;philosophes&quot; found disturbing, and thus prompted a strong reaction.

The Catholic Church in France threatened the crown with withdrawal of financial support unless it effectively suppressed the circulation of the book. The list of people writing refutations of the work was long. The prominent Catholic theologian Nicolas-Sylvestre Bergier wrote a refutation titled &quot;Examen du matérialisme&quot; (&quot;Materialism examined&quot;). Voltaire hastily seized his pen to refute the philosophy of the &quot;Système&quot; in the article &quot;Dieu&quot; in his &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot;, while Frederick the Great also drew up an answer to it. Its principles are summed up in a more popular form in d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s &quot;Good Sense, or Natural Ideas Opposed to Supernatural&quot;.

===Politics and morals===
In his last works, D&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s attention largely shifted away from religious metaphysics towards moral and political questions. In the &quot;Système social&quot; (1773), the &quot;Politique naturelle&quot; (1773–1774) and the &quot;Morale universelle&quot; (1776) he attempted to describe a system of morality in place of the Christian one he had so fiercely attacked, but these later writings were not as popular or influential as his earlier work. D&#x27;Holbach was critical towards abuses of power in France and abroad. Contrary to the revolutionary spirit of the time however, he called for the educated classes to reform the corrupt system of government and warned against revolution, democracy, and mob rule. His political and ethical views were influenced by British materialist Thomas Hobbes. D&#x27;Holbach personally translated Hobbes&#x27; work &quot;De Homine&quot; (&quot;Of Man&quot;) into French.

===Economic views===
In his &quot;Système de la nature&quot;, the three-volume &quot;Système social&quot; (1772), two-volume &quot;Politique naturelle&quot; (1772), and &quot;Ethocratie&quot; (1776), d&#x27;Holbach gave his economic views. Following Locke, d&#x27;Holbach defended private property, and stated that wealth is generated from labor and all should have the right to the product of their labor. He endorsed the theory of laissez-faire, arguing:

D&#x27;Holbach believed that the state should prevent a dangerous concentration of wealth amongst a few individuals from taking place. According to him, hereditary aristocracy should be abolished on the ground that it breeds indolence and incompetence. He criticized the then prevailing policy of the French government to let private individuals collect tax on the ground that the tax collectors often extort double the money they are supposed to collect from the citizens. He also believed that religious groups should be voluntary organizations without any government support. In addition, D&#x27;Holbach is counted among the fiercest critics of luxury in the 18th-century debate.

==Death==
D&#x27;Holbach is believed to have died shortly before the French Revolution. He was buried on 21 January 1789, in the ossuarium beneath the altar in the parish church of Saint-Roch, Paris. This ossuarium has been ransacked twice, once during the French Revolution, and again during the 1871 Paris Commune.

==D&#x27;Holbach and his contemporaries==

===D&#x27;Holbach and Diderot===
It is not clear when d&#x27;Holbach and Diderot first met, but by 1752 they definitely knew each other. This was the year when Volume II of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, containing contributions by d&#x27;Holbach, appeared. The two were in substantial agreement on questions related to religion and philosophy. They also shared similar interests like gourmandizing, taking country walks and collecting fine prints, and beautiful paintings.

When d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s radically atheistic and materialistic &quot;The System of Nature&quot; was first published, many believed Diderot to be the actual author of the book. Based on the writing style, the Durants opine that the book was not written by Diderot although he may have composed the flowery address to Nature towards the end of the book.

===D&#x27;Holbach and Rousseau===
The attendees at d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s dinners included Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau stopped attending the salon for some time after an incident in February 1754. Diderot had arranged for an acquaintance of his, the Abbé Petit, to read a tragedy composed by the Abbé at d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s. When the Abbé presented his work, he preceded it by reading his treatise on theatrical composition which the attendees at d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s found so absurd that they could not help being amused. The attendees —Diderot, Marmontel, Grimm, Saint-Lambert, and others— then proceeded to direct lavish praise at the Abbé which made him happy. D&#x27;Holbach later narrated what happened:

Later in 1754, when he learnt that Mme d&#x27;Holbach had died, Rousseau wrote a tender condolence letter to d&#x27;Holbach, and the friendship between the two men was rekindled. For three more years, Rousseau would frequent the salon of d&#x27;Holbach. D&#x27;Holbach later arranged, along with Grimm and Diderot, for an annuity of 400 livres for Rousseau&#x27;s common-law wife Thérèse Levasseur and her mother, pledging them not to reveal this to Rousseau for fear of wounding Rousseau&#x27;s pride. When Rousseau eventually found out about this, he was furious with his friends for humiliating him.

==Appreciation and influence==
According to Marmontel, d&#x27;Holbach &quot;had read everything and never forgotten anything of interest&quot;. Jean-Jacques Rousseau commented that d&#x27;Holbach could hold his own among scholars since he was learned and knowledgeable. Diderot enthusiastically endorsed d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s book &quot;System of Nature&quot;. D&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s philosophy influenced Marat, Danton, and Camille Desmoulins. According to Faguet, &quot;d&#x27;Holbach, more than Voltaire, more than Diderot, is the father of all the philosophy and all the anti-religious polemics at the end of the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century.&quot;

During the French Directory, a book of d&#x27;Holbach was circulated to all departmental heads in a bid to rein in religious revivalism. In England, d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s views influenced Priestley, Godwin, and Shelley. In Germany, d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s views influenced Immanuel Kant. It is speculated that d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s views influenced the historical materialism of Karl Marx.

Asteroid (6956) Holbach is named in honour of d&#x27;Holbach.

<text>Tzintzuntzan was the ceremonial center of the pre-Columbian Purépecha capital of the same name. The name comes from the Purépecha word &quot;Ts’intsuntsani&quot;, which means &quot;place of hummingbirds.&quot; The site includes at least 1,000 archaeological features in an area that is at least 1,075 hectares. 

After being in Pátzcuaro for the first years of the Purépecha Empire, power was consolidated in Tzintzuntzan in the mid 15th century. The empire continued to grow and hold off attacks by the neighboring Aztec Empire, until the Spanish arrived. Not wanting to suffer the destruction that the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan did, the emperor in this city surrendered to the Spanish. Eventually, much of the site and especially its distinct five rounded pyramids called &quot;yácatas&quot; were destroyed and the city almost completely abandoned. 

Due to lack of interest in the old Purépecha dominion, excavation of this site did not begin until the 1930s. Its largest construction are the five &quot;yácata&quot; pyramids, which line up looking out over Lake Pátzcuaro. The other is the large Grand Platform excavated into the hillside on which the &quot;yácatas&quot; and other buildings rest. Today the site is still used for events such as the Festival Cultural de Fin de Año.

==Capital of the Purépecha Empire==

Tzintzuntzan was the capital of the Purépecha Empire when the Spanish arrived in 1522. As these people did not leave written records, what we know of this city and its empire come from Spanish writings and archeological evidence. The main Spanish document is called the &quot;Relación de las ceremonias y ritos población y gobierno de los indios de Michoacán&quot;, written by Jerónimo de Alcalá based on what he was told by the Purépecha elite in 1539. Other writings that refer to the capital include Hernán Cortés’ fourth letter in 1524, “La información de Don Vasco de Quiroga, sobre el asiento de su iglesia Catedral,” from 1538, “Tratado curioso y doctor de las cosas de la Nueva España” by Antonio de la Ciudad Real in 1590, “Relaciones goegráficas; las Crónica de la orden de Nuestro Seráfico Padre San Francisco, provincia de San Pedro y San Pablo de Mechoacan in la Nueva España” by Alonso de la Rea in the 17th century and the “Crónica de la provincia de los santos apóstoles San Pedro y San Pablo de Michoacán” by Pablo Beaumont.

For a number of reasons, the Purépecha origins are shrouded in mystery. Much of Purépecha culture is very distinct from other Mesoamerican cultures. The Purépecha language has more in common with Zuni in the southwest U.S. and Quechua in Peru and is unrelated to any other Mesoamerican language. Jeromimo de Acalá&#x27;s collection of stories from Purépecha elders states that these people migrated to the Lake Pátzcuaro region, developing alliances among the people who were already here. Eventually, they became the dominant group and established their city at Tzintzuntzan. According to collected evidence, the Purépecha people may have begun to dominate the Pátzcuaro Lake area as early as 1000 CE, but definitely by 1250.

Purépecha traditional history states that around the year 1325 the king, warrior and hero Tarícuri declared himself lord and made Pátzcuaro his capital. His nephews were sent to rule neighboring Ihuatzio and Tzintzuntzan, and these two began to make military conquests from these points. During this time of expansion, the sphere of influence moved from Pátzcuaro to Tzintzuntzan, which had gained enough political dominance to bring the other cities under its control. During much of the empire&#x27;s history, Tzintzuntzan had at least five times the population of any of the other cities, about 36 percent of the total Pátzcuaro Basin population. Around 1440, the empire was consolidated and an administrative bureaucracy founded at Tzintzuntzan. More expansion of the empire occurred between.
The founding date of the city of Tzintzuntzan is most likely 1450, during the late post-classic period. The traditional history of the Empire for the 14th and 15th centuries is unclear because if it is to be believed, both Tarícuri and his nephews ruled for more than ninety years. Records are fairly clear that the consolidation of the empire began in the mid 15th century, producing a tributary state. The bureaucracy was centered in Tzintzuntzan and the empire expanded outside the Lake Pátzcuaro area from 1440 to 1500. This led to a very mixed ethnic composition for the empire, including the capital itself with only ten percent of the population of the lake area was ethnically Purépecha. About 25 to 35 percent of the population consisted of elites, their servants, and resident craft specialists. Political, economic and religious life was controlled from Tzintzuntzan. The site is located on the side of the Yauarato hill which permits a view of most of Lake Pátzcuaro and its shores. The hill protected this site from attack. The pre-Hispanic city of Tzintzuntzan extended from Lake Pátzcuaro to the hills just to the east and had a population of between 25,000 and 30,000 when the Spanish arrived in the 1520s. Purépecha power extended over a wide section of what is now central-west Mexico, encompassing what is now the state of Michoacán and parts of modern Guanajuato, Guerrero and Jalisco states. Despite being the capital of the second largest empire in Mesoamerica when the Spanish conquered Tenochtitlan, the city surrendered to the Spanish without a fight. There are two probable reasons for this. Even before the Spanish themselves arrived, epidemics of their diseases such as smallpox and measles had severely affected the Purépecha population, and likely killed the emperor. A new, young emperor was hastily installed, who had little political experience and hoped to work around Spanish rule, and avoid Tenochtitlán&#x27;s fate of utter destruction. This hope ended when some Spanish administrators, acting without the authorization of the crown, burned him at the stake.

Tzintzuntzan was made the first capital of the new Spanish province of Michoacán in the 1520s, and Franciscan friars arrived here to evangelize the Purépecha people. Their monastery complex was built in part from stones taken five &quot;yácata&quot; pyramids of the ceremonial center. By the 1530s, the capital had been moved to Pátzcuaro and Tzintzuntzan&#x27;s population plummeted until it was all but abandoned.

==Description of the site==
The Tzintzuntzan archeological site is mostly what was the ceremonial center. It is situated on a large artificial platform excavated into Yahuarato hill overlooking Lake Pátzcuaro from the northeast shore. The ceremonial center contains a large plaza and several buildings known to house priests and nobility but the main attraction is the five &quot;yácatas&quot; or semi-circular pyramids that face out over the lake area. This ceremonial center was called Taríaran or “House of the Wind.” The archeological site was also a defensive fortification as well as a religious center.

In this ceremonial center, the king, or &quot;cazonci,&quot; functioned as the representative of the main god Curicaueri. His principal duties were to conquer in the god&#x27;s name and to ensure that the perpetual fires of the main temples were supplied with wood. Here a great number of human sacrifices were made, usually of prisoners of war. These sacrificed prisoners were believed to be messengers to the gods and were venerated as such. When a decision to go to war was made, huge bonfires were lit here, which would then be duplicated by priests at the eight other administrative centers of the empire. All 91 settlements in the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin could see these fires, and would know to prepare for war.

Tzintzuntzan has the largest of the Purépecha kingdom&#x27;s monumental structures. The two most impressive structures here are the five &quot;yácata&quot; pyramids and the Grand Platform on which they rest. These are all visible and date from the site&#x27;s second stage of occupation. The first stage is represented by smaller pyramid-type structures found underneath the &quot;yácatas&quot;. The Grand Platform is a large flat surface of 450m by 250m excavated into the side of the hill on which the &quot;yácata&quot; pyramids and other structures rest.

At the front of the platform, facing out towards Lake Pátzcuaro, are five &quot;yácata&quot; pyramids in a row roughly from north to south. Unlike Aztec or Mayan pyramids, these structures are rounded, not square. The five structures are roughly keyhole shaped, linked together at the back by stepped pyramidal platforms. The core of each of these structures is piled-up rubble which was then faced with stone slabs decorated with spirals, circles and other geometric designs and petroglyphs. These fitted stone slabs are similar to the masonry used by the Incas in South America. Another distinction of this and other Purépecha architecture is that no indication of stucco has ever been found.

On each of the &quot;yácatas&quot; was a temple made of wood, in which the most important rites of the Purépecha people and government took place, including burials, of which about sixty have been found. The burials that have been excavated contain rich grave goods and are probably of kings and high priests. Three of the &quot;yácatas&quot; remain unreconstructed.
The &quot;yácatas&quot; were built over older, more traditional pyramidal structures from the first stage of the site&#x27;s occupation. Between &quot;Yácatas&quot; 3 and 4, openings into the Grand Platform have been dug to reveal some of these structures, which include three sets of stairs and part of a circular wall. Behind the five &quot;yácatas&quot; is an enormous plaza with some smaller structures. On the platform, only the religious and political elite, their servants and their guards lived. Rituals such as those to the different gods, the sun and moon and events such as the equinoxes took place here. At the north end of the platform is El Palacio or Building B, which was explored in the 1940s and the 1980s, with several burials of monarchs and high priests. This was a royal palace or perhaps a residential area for elite priests. The palace had a room dedicated to storing the heads of enemies killed in battle. Building E is located in the middle of the small forest on the platform. It was used to store tribute items. Within this building is evidence of occupation during early colonial times.

Tzintzuntzan was organized by distinct neighborhoods of about 40 wards, each containing 25 households. Commoners, who made up the majority of the population, lived in small houses. They farmed and also produced consumer goods in residential workshops. Their marketplace most likely met daily and had local as well as imported goods, however its location has not been determined.

The Site Museum of the Archeological Zone of Tzintzuntzan was inaugurated in 1992, with the basic purpose of exhibiting items from the site. The museum contains one hall in which there are displays of religious, decorative and utilitarian items. There are graphics relating the history of the empire&#x27;s governors as well as a map of modern Michoacán indicating the locations from which the displayed objects originated. The museum offers guided tours and the sale of publications and reproductions of artifacts.

==Excavation of the site==

In contrast to the Aztecs and the Maya, the ancient Purépechans left little monumental architecture. Towns were not fortified in any significant way, and roads had little if any paving. Only two ball courts are known in the area of the old empire and neither is in the capital. Until relatively recently, archeologists, anthropologists and historians had little interest in these people. There was even doubt that the Purépechans ever had a state society. However, recent investigations have revealed that the ancient Purépecha had a vast empire, second in territory only to the Aztecs and a complex culture that was in many ways unlike any other in Mesoamerica.

The first modern references to the &quot;yácatas&quot; of Tzintzuntzan date from the writings of Beaumont (1855), when Tzintzuntzan was first identified as the capital of the ancient Purépecha state. The first fieldwork here was that of Nicolas León in 1888. He outlined the basic characteristics of the buildings and gave a brief history of the site, emphasizing the events that led to the ancient city&#x27;s destruction. However, no excavations took place at the site until the 1930s.

The area that is now open to the public is the first area to be excavated and reconstructed at the end of the 1930s. In 1930, Caso and Noguera began the first formal excavation in Tzintzuntzan. Their work proved difficult because of the composition of the soil, which made identifying the strata of the site and its chronology difficult.
 In 1937, a series of eleven seasons of work at the site began to clean the site, consolidate it and reconstruct the main architectural elements. Other studies took place alongside this work. This work was headed by Alfonso Caso and focused on &quot;Yácata&quot; Number 5, as well as the consolidation of the north end of the line of &quot;yácatas&quot;. During the 1938 season, further consolidation was undertaken as well as the excavation of burials and the attempt to establish a chronology of occupation via layers. &quot;Yácata&quot; 5 was cleaned, as well as Building A (from colonial times) and Building B was discovered. From 1940 to 1946, &quot;Yácata&quot; 5 was finished, and Buildings B and C were excavated. Topographical and strata studies were undertaken in support of the study of ceramics here. Excavation of burials was completed, and the rectangular area between &quot;Yácatas&quot; 4 and 5 was investigated, as well as the rectangular area by &quot;Yácata&quot; 1. From 1962 to 1968, the area was explored by Dr. Piña Chan. The front of &quot;Yácata&quot; 1 and the wall delimiting the Grand Platform were reconstructed. A colonial-era building was discovered (Building D), an altar in Building B was discovered and &quot;Yácata&quot; 5 was excavated to determine how it was built. The neighborhood of Santa Ana, which is in front of the &quot;yácata&quot; pyramids was explored and more reconstructions of &quot;yácatas&quot; and walls was done. In the 1970s, a detailed map was made of the site, relying on both that archaeology that has so far been done and period records. The ceremonial plaza and the perimeter, as well as &quot;Yácatas&quot; 2 and 3, were the last to be studied. Building E, a storage facility was also found and explored. Outside the perimeter, an obsidian workshop with living quarters was found.

The last time the area was studied was in 1992 by Efraín Cárdenas. The northwest face of the Great Platform was restored and the site museum was built.

==The site today==
The &quot;yácatas&quot; are considered one of the most emblematic sites of the area. The site hosts the annual Festival Cultural de Fin de Año in which the indigenous communities around Lake Pátzcuaro demonstrate their culture, mostly through song and dance. The annual event is sponsored by the local municipality, other lake communities as well as the state Secretary of Tourism. It takes place at the end of December between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day. Some of the traditional dances that take place include the Danza del Pescado, Danza de los Moros, Danza de los Tumbies and Pescador Navegante. In the evening, there are Purépecha ball games (uárukua) in which the ball is set on fire and sticks similar to those used in hockey are employed. The actual Purépecha new year is the beginning of February.

=== Religion in the land ===
The most well-known church still standing in Tzintzuntzan is the &quot;Monastery of San Francisco&quot;; its two open chapels attract tourists interested in the country&#x27;s religious history.

<text>Kilmainham Gaol () is a former prison in Kilmainham, Dublin. It is now a museum run by the Office of Public Works, an agency of the Government of Ireland. Many Irish revolutionaries, including the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising (Patrick Pearse, James Connolly, Tom Clarke, Seán Mac Diarmada, Joseph Plunkett, Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas MacDonagh), were imprisoned and executed in the prison by the orders of the UK Government.

==History==
When it was first built in 1796, Kilmainham Gaol was called the &quot;New Gaol&quot; to distinguish it from the old prison it was intended to replace – a noisome dungeon, just a few hundred metres from the present site. It was officially called the &quot;County of Dublin Gaol&quot;, and was originally run by the Grand Jury for County Dublin.

Originally, public hangings took place at the front of the prison. However, from the 1820s onward very few hangings, public or private, took place at Kilmainham. A small hanging cell was built in the prison in 1891. It is located on the first floor, between the west wing and the east wing.

There was no segregation of prisoners; men, women and children were incarcerated up to 5 in each cell, with only a single candle for light and heat. Most of their time was spent in the cold and the dark, and each candle had to last for two weeks. Its cells were roughly 28 square metres in area.

Children were sometimes arrested for petty theft, the youngest said to be a seven-year-old child, while many of the adult prisoners were transported to Australia.

At Kilmainham, the poor conditions in which women prisoners were kept provided the spur for the next stage of development. As early as 1809, in his report, the Inspector had observed that male prisoners were supplied with iron bedsteads while females &quot;lay on straw on the flags in the cells and common halls&quot;. Half a century later there was little improvement. The women&#x27;s section, located in the west wing, remained overcrowded. In an attempt to relieve the overcrowding, 30 female cells were added to the Gaol in 1840. These improvements had not been made long before the Great Famine occurred, and Kilmainham was overwhelmed with the increase of prisoners.

During the 1923 Irish hunger strikes Kilmainham was the site of several hunger strikes. In March 1923, 97 women went on hunger strike in Kilmainham Gaol after all of their privileges had been denied without explanation (that hunger strike ended later in the month with the restoration of privileges). Annie (Nan) Hogan of Cumann na mBan died at the age of 24 after being released from prison (September 1923) &quot;in a very emaciated state&quot; due to her participation in hunger strikes in Kilmainham and the North Dublin Union jails. 

==Post-independence period==

Kilmainham Gaol was decommissioned as a prison by the Irish Free State government in 1924. Seen principally as a site of oppression and suffering, there was at this time no declared interest in its preservation as a monument to the struggle for national independence. The jail&#x27;s potential function as a location of national memory was also undercut and complicated by the fact that the first four Republican prisoners executed by the Free State government during the Irish Civil War were shot in the prison yard.

The Irish Prison Board contemplated reopening it as a prison during the 1920s but all such plans were finally abandoned in 1929. In 1936 the government considered the demolition of the prison but the price of this undertaking was seen as prohibitive. Republican interest in the site began to develop from the late 1930s, most notably with the proposal by the National Graves Association, a Republican organisation, to preserve the site as both a museum and memorial to the 1916 Easter Rising. This proposal received no objections from the Commissioners of Public Works, who costed it at £600, and negotiations were entered into with the Department of Education about the possibility of relocating artefacts relating to the 1916 Rising housed in the National Museum to a new museum at the Kilmainham Gaol site. The Department of Education rejected this proposal seeing the site as unsuitable for this purpose and suggested instead that paintings of nationalist leaders could be installed in appropriate prison cells. However, with the advent of the Emergency the proposal was shelved for the duration of the war.

An architectural survey commissioned by the Office of Public Works after World War II revealed that the prison was in a ruinous condition. With the Department of Education still intransigent to the site&#x27;s conversion to a nationalist museum and with no other apparent function for the building, the Commissioners of Public Works proposed only the prison yard and those cell blocks deemed to be of national importance should be preserved and that the rest of the site should be demolished. This proposal was not acted upon.

In 1953 the Department of the Taoiseach, as part of a scheme to generate employment, re-considered the proposal of the National Graves Association to restore the prison and establish a museum at the site. However, no advance was made and the material condition of the prison continued to deteriorate.

==Kilmainham Gaol Restoration Society==

From the late 1950s, a grassroots movement for the preservation of Kilmainham Gaol began to develop. Provoked by reports that the Office of Public Works was accepting tenders for the demolition of the building, Lorcan C.G. Leonard, a young engineer from the north side of Dublin, along with a small number of like-minded nationalists, formed the Kilmainham Gaol Restoration Society in 1958. In order to offset any potential division among its members, the society agreed that they should not address any of the events connected with the Civil War period in relation to the restoration project. Instead, a narrative of the unified national struggle was to be articulated. A scheme was then devised that the prison should be restored and a museum built using voluntary labour and donated materials.

With momentum for the project growing, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions informed the society that they would not oppose their plan and the Building Trades Council gave it their support. It is also likely that Dublin Corporation, which had shown an interest in the preservation of the prison, supported the proposal. At this time the Irish government was coming under increasing pressure from the National Graves Association and the Old IRA Literary and Debating Society to take action to preserve the site. Thus, when the society submitted their plan in late 1958 the government looked favourably on a proposal that would achieve this goal without occasioning any significant financial commitment from the state.

In February 1960 the society&#x27;s detailed plan for the restoration project, which notably also envisioned the site&#x27;s development as a tourist attraction, received the approval of the notoriously parsimonious Department of Finance. The formal handing over of prison keys to a board of trustees, composed of five members nominated by the society and two by the government, occurred in May 1960. The trustees were charged a nominal rent of one penny rent per annum to extend for a period of five years at which point it was envisaged that the restored prison would be permanently transferred to the trustees&#x27; custodial care.

Commencing with a workforce of sixty volunteers in May 1960, the society set about clearing the overgrown vegetation, trees, fallen masonry and bird droppings from the site. By 1962 the symbolically important prison yard where the leaders of the 1916 Rising were executed had been cleared of rubble and weeds and the restoration of the Victorian section of the prison was nearing completion. It opened to the public on 10 April 1966. The final restoration of the site was completed in 1971 when Kilmainham Gaol chapel was re-opened to the public having been reroofed and re-floored and with its altar reconstructed. The Magill family acted as residential caretakers, in particular, Joe Magill who worked on the restoration of the gaol from the start until the Gaol was handed over to the Office of Public works.

It now houses a museum on the history of Irish nationalism and offers guided tours of the building. An art gallery on the top floor exhibits paintings, sculptures and jewellery of prisoners incarcerated in prisons all over contemporary Ireland.

Kilmainham Gaol is one of the biggest unoccupied prisons in Europe. 

In 2013, Kilmainham courthouse located beside the prison, which had remained in operation as a seat of the Dublin District court until 2008 was handed over to the OPW for refurbishment as part of a broader redevelopment of the Gaol and the surrounding Kilmainham Plaza in advance of the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising. The courthouse opened in 2015 as the attached visitor&#x27;s centre for the Gaol.

==Historical importance==
Kilmainham Gaol housed prisoners during the Irish War of Independence (1919–21) and many of the anti-treaty forces during the civil war period. Charles Stewart Parnell was imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol, along with most of his parliamentary colleagues, in 1881-82 when he signed the Kilmainham Treaty with William Gladstone.

<doc id="195765" wikidata="Q643836" url="?curid=195765" title="Red-billed chough">
<text>The red-billed chough, Cornish chough or simply chough ( ; Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), is a bird in the crow family, one of only two species in the genus &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot;. Its eight subspecies breed on mountains and coastal cliffs from the western coasts of Ireland and Britain east through southern Europe and North Africa to Central Asia, India and China.

This bird has glossy black plumage, a long curved red bill, red legs, and a loud, ringing call. It has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely spread primaries. The red-billed chough pairs for life and displays fidelity to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face. It builds a wool-lined stick nest and lays three eggs. It feeds, often in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey.

Although it is subject to predation and parasitism, the main threat to this species is changes in agricultural practices, which have led to population decline, some local extinction and range fragmentation in Europe; however, it is not threatened globally. The red-billed chough, which derived its common name &#x27;chough&#x27; from the jackdaw, was formerly associated with fire-raising, and has links with Saint Thomas Becket and Cornwall.

==Taxonomy==
The red-billed chough was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Upupa pyrrhocorax&quot;. It was moved to its current genus, &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot;, by Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 &quot;Ornithologia Britannica&quot;. The genus name is derived from Greek &quot;πυρρός (pyrrhos)&quot;, &quot;flame-coloured&quot;, and &quot;κόραξ (korax)&quot;, &quot;raven&quot;. The only other member of the genus is the Alpine chough &quot;Pyrrhocorax graculus&quot;; hybrids with Alpine chough are known.

Traditionally, the closest relatives of the choughs have been thought to be the typical crows &quot;Corvus&quot; and the jackdaws &quot;Coloeus&quot;, but more recent genetic studies have suggested the choughs are basal to a group of Asian jay genera (&quot;Crypsirina, Dendrocitta, Platysmurus, Temnurus&quot;), or most recently, basal in the entire Corvidae.

===Subspecies===
There are eight extant subspecies, although differences between them are slight.
* &quot;P. p. pyrrhocorax&quot;, the nominate subspecies and smallest form, is endemic to the British Isles, where it is restricted to Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the west of Wales, southwest Scotland, and Cornwall, which it recolonised in 2001 after an absence of 50 years.
* &quot;P. p. erythroramphos&quot;, described by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1817 as &quot;Coracia erythrorhamphos&quot;, occurs in the red-billed chough&#x27;s continental European range, excluding Greece. It is larger and slightly greener than the nominate race.
* &quot;P. p. barbarus&quot;, described by Charles Vaurie under its current name in 1954, is resident in North Africa and on La Palma in the Canary Islands. Compared to &quot;P. p. erythroramphos&quot;, it is larger, has a longer tail and wings, and its plumage has a greener gloss. It is the longest-billed form, both absolutely and relatively.
* &quot;P. p. baileyi&quot; described by Austin Loomer Rand and Charles Vaurie under its current name in 1955, is a dull-plumaged subspecies endemic to Ethiopia, where it occurs in two separate areas. The two populations could possibly represent different subspecies.
* &quot;P. p. docilis&quot;, described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin as &quot;Corvus docilis&quot; in 1774, breeds from Greece to Afghanistan. It is larger than the African subspecies, but it has a smaller bill and its plumage is very green-tinted, with little gloss.
* &quot;P. p. himalayanus&quot;, described by John Gould in 1862 as &quot;Fregilus himalayanus&quot;, is found from the Himalayas to western China, but intergrades with &quot;P. p. docilis&quot; in the west of its range. It is the largest subspecies, long-tailed, and with blue or purple-blue glossed feathers.
* &quot;P. p. centralis&quot;, described by Erwin Stresemann in 1928 under its current name, breeds in Central Asia. It is smaller and less strongly blue than &quot;P. p. himalayanus&quot;, but its distinctness from the next subspecies has been questioned.
* &quot;P. p. brachypus&quot;, described by Robert Swinhoe in 1871 as &quot;Fregilus graculus&quot; var. &quot;brachypus&quot;, breeds in central and northern China, Mongolia and southern Siberia. It is similar to &quot;P. p. centralis&quot; but with a weaker bill.

The small population in Brittany has often been included with British and Irish birds in the nominate subspecies &quot;P. p. pyrrhocorax&quot;, but is now included with other mainland Western European populations in &quot;P. p. erythroramphos&quot;; in some aspects it is intermediate between the two subspecies.

Detailed analysis of call similarity suggests that the Asiatic and Ethiopian races diverged from the western subspecies early in evolutionary history, and that Italian red-billed choughs are more closely allied to the North African subspecies than to those of the rest of Europe.

There is one known prehistoric form of the red-billed chough. &quot;P. p. primigenius&quot;, a subspecies that lived in Europe during the last ice age, which was described in 1875 by Alphonse Milne-Edwards from finds in southwest France.

===Etymology===
&quot;Chough&quot; was originally an alternative onomatopoeic name for the jackdaw &quot;Coloeus monedula&quot;, based on its call. The similar red-billed species, formerly particularly common in Cornwall, became known initially as &quot;Cornish chough&quot; and then just &quot;chough&quot;, the name transferring from one species to the other.

The Australian white-winged chough &quot;Corcorax melanorhamphos&quot;, despite its similar shape and habits, is in a separate family Corcoracidae only moderately related to the Corvidae and not notably to the true choughs, and is an example of convergent evolution.

==Description==
The adult of the &quot;nominate&quot; subspecies of the red-billed chough, &quot;P. p. pyrrhocorax&quot;, is in length, has a wingspan, and weighs an average 310 grammes (10.9 oz). Its plumage is velvet-black, green-glossed on the body, and it has a long curved red bill and red legs. The sexes are similar (although adults can be sexed in the hand using a formula involving tarsus length and bill width) but the juvenile has an orange bill and pink legs until its first autumn, and less glossy plumage.

The red-billed chough is unlikely to be confused with any other species of bird. Although the jackdaw and Alpine chough share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the Alpine chough has a short yellow bill. Even in flight, the two choughs can be distinguished by Alpine&#x27;s less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.

The red-billed chough&#x27;s loud, ringing &quot;chee-ow&quot; call is clearer and louder than the similar vocalisation of the jackdaw, and always very different from that of its yellow-billed congener, which has rippling &quot;preep&quot; and whistled &quot;sweeeooo&quot; calls. Small subspecies of the red-billed chough have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.

==Distribution and habitat==
The red-billed chough breeds in Ireland, western Great Britain, the Isle of Man, Brittany, La Palma in the Canary Islands, across southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin, the Alps, and in mountainous country across Central Asia, India and China, with two separate populations in the Ethiopian Highlands. It is a non-migratory resident throughout its range.

Its main habitat is high mountains; it is found between in North Africa, and mainly between in the Himalayas. In that mountain range it reaches in the summer, and has been recorded at altitude on Mount Everest. In the British Isles and Brittany it also breeds on coastal sea cliffs, feeding on adjacent short grazed grassland or machair. It was formerly more widespread on coasts but has suffered from the loss of its specialised habitat. It tends to breed at a lower elevation than the Alpine chough, that species having a diet better adapted to high altitudes.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
The red-billed chough breeds from three years of age, and normally raises only one brood a year, although the age at first breeding is greater in large populations. A pair exhibits strong mate and site fidelity once a bond is established. The bulky nest is composed of roots and stems of heather, furze or other plants, and is lined with wool or hair; in central Asia, the hair may be taken from live Himalayan tahr. The nest is constructed in a cave or similar fissure in a crag or cliff face. In soft sandstone, the birds themselves excavate holes nearly a metre deep. Old buildings may be used, and in Tibet working monasteries provide sites, as occasionally do modern buildings in Mongolian towns, including Ulaanbaatar. The red-billed chough will utilise other artificial sites, such as quarries and mineshafts for nesting where they are available.

The chough lays three to five eggs in size and weighing 15.7 grammes (0.55 oz), of which 6% is shell. They are spotted, not always densely, in various shades of brown and grey on a creamy or slightly tinted ground.
The egg size is independent of the clutch size and the nest site, but may vary between different females. The female incubates for 17–18 days before the altricial downy chicks are hatched, and is fed at the nest by the male. The female broods the newly hatched chicks for around ten days, and then both parents share feeding and nest sanitation duties. The chicks fledge 31–41 days after hatching.

Juveniles have a 43% chance of surviving their first year, and the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years, although an age of 17 years has been recorded. The temperature and rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates with the number of young fledging each year and their survival rate. Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.

===Feeding===

The red-billed chough&#x27;s food consists largely of insects, spiders and other invertebrates taken from the ground, with ants probably being the most significant item. The Central Asian subspecies &quot;P. p. centralis&quot; will perch on the backs of wild or domesticated mammals to feed on parasites. Although invertebrates make up most of the chough&#x27;s diet, it will eat vegetable matter including fallen grain, and in the Himalayas has been reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn. In the Himalayas, they form large flocks in winter.

The preferred feeding habitat is short grass produced by grazing, for example by sheep and rabbits, the numbers of which are linked to the chough&#x27;s breeding success. Suitable feeding areas can also arise where plant growth is hindered by exposure to coastal salt spray or poor soils. It will use its long curved bill to pick ants, dung beetles and emerging flies off the surface, or to dig for grubs and other invertebrates. The typical excavation depth of reflects the thin soils which it feeds on, and the depths at which many invertebrates occur, but it may dig to in appropriate conditions.

Where the two chough species occur together, there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively &quot;Gagea&quot; bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.

===Natural threats===

The red-billed chough&#x27;s predators include the peregrine falcon, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain, red-billed choughs preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colonies. This small insectivorous falcon is better at detecting a predator and more vigorous in defence than its corvid neighbours. The breeding success of the red-billed chough in the vicinity of the kestrels was found to be much higher than that of birds elsewhere, with a lower percentage of nest failures (16% near the falcon, 65% elsewhere).

This species is occasionally parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo, a brood parasite for which the Eurasian magpie is the primary host.
Red-billed choughs can acquire blood parasites such as &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, but a study in Spain showed that the prevalence was less than one percent, and unlikely to affect the life history and conservation of this species. These low levels of parasitism contrast with a much higher prevalence in some other passerine groups; for example a study of thrushes in Russia showed that &quot;all&quot; the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; and &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;.

Red-billed choughs can also carry mites, but a study of the feather mite &quot;Gabucinia delibata&quot;, acquired by young birds a few months after fledging when they join communal roosts, suggested that this parasite actually &quot;improved&quot; the body condition of its host. It is possible that the feather mites enhance feather cleaning and deter pathogens, and may complement other feather care measures such as sunbathing, and anting—rubbing the plumage with ants (the formic acid from the insects deters parasites).

==Status==
The red-billed chough has an extensive range, estimated at , and a large population, including an estimated 86,000 to 210,000 individuals in Europe. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern.

However, the European range has declined and fragmented due to the loss of traditional pastoral farming, persecution and perhaps disturbance at breeding and nesting sites, although the numbers in France, Great Britain and Ireland may now have stabilised. The European breeding population is between 12,265 and 17,370 pairs, but only in Spain is the species still widespread. Since in the rest of the continent breeding areas are fragmented and isolated, the red-billed chough has been categorised as &quot;vulnerable&quot; in Europe.

In Spain the red-billed chough has recently expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings are threatened by human disturbance, persecution and the loss of old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.

A small group of wild red-billed chough arrived naturally in Cornwall in 2001, and nested in the following year. This was the first English breeding record since 1947, and a slowly expanding population has bred every subsequent year. The Chough Reintroduction Project, a partnership between Kent Wildlife Trust, Wildwood Trust and Paradise Park, Cornwall, reintroduced the red-billed chough to South East England where it had previously been extinct for over two centuries. The first of several releases took place at a secret location in Dover in July 2023, releasing eight choughs which came from a zoo-based breeding programme coordinated by Paradise Park in Cornwall. By October 2023, the released choughs had been spotted flying as far as Dover Castle. In May 2024, the first wild red-billed chough chick to be born in Kent for generations was discovered at Dover Castle and was reported to have fledged successfully the following month, but went missing during strong winds in early July. A second release of six female choughs into the wild took place in July 2024. By September 2024 an additional six male choughs had been released into the wild, increasing the total number of wild red-billed chough in Kent to nineteen animals.

In Jersey, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in partnership with the States of Jersey and the National Trust for Jersey began a project in 2010, aimed at restoring selected areas of Jersey&#x27;s coastline with the intention of returning those birds that had become locally extinct. The red-billed chough was chosen as a flagship species for this project, having been absent from Jersey since around 1900. Durrell initially received two pairs of choughs from Paradise Park in Cornwall and began a captive breeding programme. In 2013, juveniles were released onto the north coast of Jersey using soft-release methods developed at Durrell. Over the next five years, small cohorts of captive-bred choughs were released, monitored, and provided supplemental food.

==In culture==
===Greek mythology===
In Greek mythology, the red-billed chough, also known as &#x27;sea-crow&#x27;, was considered sacred to the Titan Cronus and dwelt on Ogygia, Calypso&#x27;s &#x27;Blessed Island&#x27;, where &quot;The birds of broadest wing their mansions form/The chough, the sea-mew, the loquacious crow.&quot;

===Cornish heraldry===
The red-billed chough has a long association with Cornwall, and appears on the Cornish coat of arms. According to Cornish legend King Arthur did not die after his last battle but rather his soul migrated into the body of a red-billed chough, the red colour of its bill and legs being derived from the blood of the last battle and hence killing this bird was unlucky. Legend also holds that after the last Cornish chough departs from Cornwall, then the return of the chough, as happened in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.

In English heraldry the bird is always blazoned as &quot;a Cornish chough&quot; and is usually shown &quot;proper&quot;, with tinctures as in nature. Since the 14th century, St Thomas Becket (d.1170), Archbishop of Canterbury, has retrospectively acquired an attributed coat of arms consisting of three Cornish choughs on a white field, although as he died 30 to 45 years before the start of the age of heraldry, in reality he bore no arms. These attributed arms appear in many English churches dedicated to him. The symbolism behind the association is not known for certain. According to one legend, a chough strayed into Canterbury Cathedral during Becket&#x27;s murder, while another suggests that the choughs are a canting reference to Becket&#x27;s name, as they were once known as &quot;beckits&quot;. However the latter theory does not stand up to scrutiny, as the use of the term &quot;beckit&quot; to mean a chough is not found before the 19th century. Regardless of its origin, the chough is still used in heraldry as a symbol of Becket, and appears in the arms of several persons and institutions associated with him, most notably in the arms of the city of Canterbury.

===Nuisance species===
Up to the eighteenth century, the red-billed chough was associated with fire-raising, and was described by William Camden as &quot;incendaria avis&quot;, &quot;oftentime it secretly conveieth fire sticks, setting their houses afire&quot;. Daniel Defoe was also familiar with this story:
It is counted little better than a kite, for it is of ravenous quality, and is very mischievous; it will steal and carry away any thing it finds about the house, that is not too heavy, tho&#x27; not fit for its food; as knives, forks, spoons and linnen cloths, or whatever it can fly away with, sometimes they say it has stolen bits of firebrands, or lighted candles, and lodged them in the stacks of corn, and the thatch of barns and houses, and set them on fire; but this I only had by oral tradition.

Not all mentions of &quot;chough&quot; refer to this species. Because of the origins of its name, when Shakespeare writes of &quot;the crows and choughs that wing the midway air&quot; [&quot;King Lear&quot;, act 4, scene 6] or Henry VIII&#x27;s Vermin Act 1532 is &quot;ordeyned to dystroye Choughes, Crowes and Rookes&quot;, they are clearly referring to the jackdaw.

===Other symbolism===
The red-billed chough has been depicted on postage stamps of a few countries, including the Isle of Man, with four different stamps, Bhutan, Turkmenistan, Yugoslavia, and The Gambia, where the bird does not occur. It is the animal symbol of the island of La Palma.

<doc id="195767" wikidata="Q928243" url="?curid=195767" title="Sweetheart of the Rodeo">
<text>Sweetheart of the Rodeo is the sixth studio album by the American rock band the Byrds, released in August 1968 by Columbia Records. Recorded with the addition of country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, it became the first album widely recognized as country rock as well as a seminal progressive country album, and represented a stylistic move away from the psychedelic rock of the band&#x27;s previous LP, &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;. The Byrds had occasionally experimented with country music on their four previous albums, but &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; represented their fullest immersion into the genre up to that point in time. The album was responsible for bringing Parsons, who had joined the Byrds in February 1968 prior to the start of recording, to the attention of a mainstream rock audience for the first time. Thus, the album is an important chapter in Parsons&#x27; crusade to make country music fashionable for a young audience.

The album was conceived as a history of 20th century American popular music, encompassing examples of country music, jazz and rhythm and blues, among other genres. However, steered by the passion of the little-known Parsons, this concept was abandoned early on and the album instead became purely a country record. The recording of the album was divided between sessions in Nashville and Los Angeles, with contributions from session musicians including Lloyd Green, John Hartford, JayDee Maness, and Clarence White. Tension developed between Parsons and the rest of the band, guitarist Roger McGuinn especially, and some of Parsons&#x27; vocals were re-recorded, partly due to legal issues. By the time the album was released, Parsons had left the band. The Byrds&#x27; move away from rock and pop towards country music elicited a great deal of resistance and hostility from the ultra-conservative Nashville country music establishment, who viewed the Byrds as a group of hippies attempting to subvert country music.

Upon its release, the album reached number 77 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, but failed to reach the charts in the United Kingdom. Two attendant singles were released during 1968, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Nowhere&quot;, which achieved modest success, and &quot;I Am a Pilgrim&quot;, which failed to chart. The album received mostly positive reviews in the music press, but the band&#x27;s shift away from psychedelic music alienated much of its pop audience. Despite being the least commercially successful Byrds&#x27; album to date upon release, &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; is today considered to be a seminal and highly influential country rock album.

==Background (January–March 1968)==
The initial concept by Roger McGuinn for the album that would become &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was to expand upon the genre-spanning approach of the Byrds&#x27; previous LP, &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;, by recording a double album overview of the history of American popular music. The planned album would begin with bluegrass and Appalachian music, then move through country and western, jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock music, before culminating with futuristic proto-electronica featuring the Moog modular synthesizer.

But with a U.S. college tour to promote &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; looming, a more immediate concern was the recruitment of new band members. David Crosby and Michael Clarke had been dismissed from the band in late 1967, leaving Roger McGuinn as &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Byrds, along with Chris Hillman, the only other remaining member of the band. To address this problem, McGuinn hired Hillman&#x27;s cousin, Kevin Kelley (formerly a member of the Rising Sons), as the band&#x27;s new drummer, and it was this three-piece line-up, with McGuinn on guitar and Hillman on bass, that embarked on the early 1968 college tour. It soon became apparent, however, that the Byrds were having difficulty performing their studio material live as a trio, and so it was decided that a fourth member was required. McGuinn, with an eye still on his envisaged American music concept album, felt that a pianist with a jazz background would be ideal for the group.

A candidate was found by Larry Spector, the band&#x27;s business manager, in the shape of 21-year-old Gram Parsons. Parsons, a marginal figure in the L.A. music scene, had been acquainted with Hillman since 1967 and he auditioned for the band as a piano player in February 1968. His faux-jazz piano playing and genial personality at audition was enough to impress both McGuinn and Hillman; so Parsons was recruited as the fourth member of the band, although he quickly switched to playing guitar instead of piano. Although Parsons and Kelley were full members of the Byrds, they received a salary from McGuinn and Hillman and did not sign with Columbia Records when the Byrds&#x27; recording contract was renewed on February 29, 1968.
Unbeknownst to McGuinn or Hillman, Parsons had his own musical agenda in which he planned to marry his love of traditional country music (which he saw as the purest form of American music) with youth culture&#x27;s passion for rock. He had already successfully attempted this fusion as a member of the little-known International Submarine Band, on the album &quot;Safe at Home&quot;, but Parsons&#x27; new status as a Byrd offered him an international stage from which to launch his bid to reclaim country music for his generation.

Following his recruitment, Parsons began to lure Hillman away from McGuinn&#x27;s concept album idea and towards a blend of what Parsons would later term &quot;Cosmic American Music&quot;. In essence, this was a hybrid of various roots music forms, primarily oriented towards honky tonk country music but also encompassing American folk, soul, rhythm and blues, rock ’n’ roll and contemporary rock. Hillman, who had come from a musical background firmly rooted in bluegrass, had successfully persuaded the Byrds to incorporate country influences into their music in the past, beginning with the song &quot;Satisfied Mind&quot; on their 1965 album, &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; Many of Hillman&#x27;s songs on the &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot; and &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; albums also had a pronounced country feel, with several featuring Clarence White (a renowned bluegrass guitar player and session musician) on lead guitar, rather than McGuinn. During time spent singing old country songs with Parsons, Hillman became convinced that Parsons&#x27; concept of a country-oriented version of the Byrds could work.

Parsons&#x27; passion for his country rock vision was so contagious that he convinced McGuinn to abandon plans for the Byrds&#x27; next album and follow Parsons&#x27; lead in recording a country rock album. Parsons also persuaded McGuinn and Hillman to record the album in the country music capital of Nashville, Tennessee, as Bob Dylan had done for his &quot;Blonde On Blonde&quot; and &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; albums. Although McGuinn had reservations about the band&#x27;s new direction, he decided that such a move could expand the already declining audience of the group. After long-time Byrds&#x27; producer Gary Usher, who had little interest in producing McGuinn&#x27;s concept album, indicated a preference for the country concept, McGuinn acquiesced. On March 9, 1968, the band decamped to Columbia&#x27;s recording facility in Nashville to begin recording sessions for &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;.

==Recording (March–May 1968)==
Between March 9 and March 15, 1968, the band, accompanied by several prominent session musicians, recorded multiple takes of eight songs at Columbia&#x27;s Studio A in the Music Row area of Nashville. Recording sessions for the album continued from April 4 through May 27, 1968, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, with a further seven songs recorded during these sessions and finishing touches applied to many of the tracks recorded in Nashville.
The songs that the Byrds recorded for the album included &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Nothing Was Delivered&quot;, two country-influenced Dylan covers from his then-unreleased &quot;Basement Tapes&quot; sessions. Despite the change in musical style that the &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album represented, the inclusion of two Dylan covers provided a link with their previous folk-rock incarnation, when Dylan&#x27;s material had been a mainstay of their repertoire. The Byrds also recorded a trio of classic country songs for the album: the traditional &quot;I Am a Pilgrim&quot;, which Merle Travis popularized in the late-1940s; the Cindy Walker-penned &quot;Blue Canadian Rockies&quot;, which had been sung by Gene Autry in the 1952 film of the same name; and &quot;The Christian Life&quot;, written by the Louvin Brothers, which was the antithesis of a traditional rock song with its gentle lyrics extolling the simple pleasures of Christianity as a lifestyle.

The band supplemented these older country standards and Dylan covers with two contemporary country songs: Merle Haggard&#x27;s maudlin convict&#x27;s lament, &quot;Life in Prison&quot;; and Luke McDaniel&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Still On My Mind&quot;, a sorrowful tale of a heartbroken drunkard failing to find solace at the bottom of a bottle. Additionally, the Byrds gave William Bell&#x27;s Stax hit, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Miss Your Water&quot;, a country flavored make-over, highlighted by the band&#x27;s trademark crystal clear harmonies and contributions from JayDee Maness and Earl P. Ball, on pedal steel guitar and honky-tonk piano respectively. With its fusion of country and soul, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Miss Your Water&quot; was a perfect example of what Parsons would later define, with his self-coined phrase, as &quot;Cosmic American Music&quot;.
Lacking any country songs of his own, McGuinn delved into his pre-Byrds folk song repertoire instead, contributing Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot;, a romanticized portrayal of the real-life folk hero and outlaw. The March 12, 1968 recording session that produced &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; saw McGuinn attempting to play the song&#x27;s banjo accompaniment, but feeling dissatisfied with his efforts, he ceded the part to session player John Hartford. The Byrds also recorded a Kelley original, &quot;All I Have Are Memories&quot;, Tim Hardin&#x27;s &quot;You Got a Reputation&quot;, and the traditional song, &quot;Pretty Polly&quot;, but none of these songs were selected for the final &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album.

Parsons brought three of his songs to the recording sessions: &quot;Lazy Days&quot;, &quot;One Hundred Years from Now&quot; and &quot;Hickory Wind&quot;, the latter of which had been written by Parsons and former International Submarine Band member, Bob Buchanan, during an early 1968 train ride from Florida to Los Angeles. &quot;One Hundred Years from Now&quot; has a quicker tempo than most of the material on &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; and functions as a speculation on current human vanities and how they might be viewed by successive generations. The Chuck Berry-influenced &quot;Lazy Days&quot; was not included in the final album, but was re-recorded by Parsons and Hillman&#x27;s later band, the Flying Burrito Brothers, for their 1970 album, &quot;Burrito Deluxe&quot;.

==Nashville reaction and touring==

Upon completion of the Music Row recording sessions, the band ended their stay in Nashville with an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry at Ryman Auditorium (introduced by future &quot;outlaw&quot; country star Tompall Glaser), on March 15, 1968. The band was greeted with derision by the conservative audience because they were the first group of hippie &quot;longhairs&quot; to play at the venerable country music establishment. In fact, the Byrds had all had their hair cut shorter than they normally wore it, specifically for their appearance at the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, but this did nothing to appease their detractors in the audience. The Byrds opened with a rendition of Merle Haggard&#x27;s &quot;Sing Me Back Home&quot;, which was met with derisive heckling, booing, and mocking calls of &quot;tweet, tweet&quot; from the hostile &quot;Opry&quot; audience. Any hope of salvaging the performance was immediately destroyed when Parsons, rather than singing a song announced by Glaser, launched into a rendition of &quot;Hickory Wind&quot; dedicated to his grandmother. This deviation from protocol stunned &quot;Opry&quot; regulars such as Roy Acuff, and embarrassed Glaser, ensuring that the Byrds would never be invited back to play on the show.

Nearly as disastrous was the group&#x27;s appearance on the WSM program of legendary Nashville DJ, Ralph Emery, who mocked his guests throughout the interview and initially refused to play an acetate of &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Nowhere&quot;. Eventually playing the record, he dismissed it over the air and in the presence of the band as being mediocre. Clearly upset by their treatment, Parsons and McGuinn would make Emery the subject of their song, &quot;Drug Store Truck Drivin&#x27; Man&quot;, which was written by the pair in London in May 1968. The song appeared on the Byrds&#x27; next album, &quot;Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde&quot;, although this recording did not feature Parsons because he had left the band by this time.

After returning from Nashville, the band played a handful of concerts throughout the Los Angeles area with the addition of pedal steel guitarist JayDee Maness, who had played on several tracks on the album and Parsons&#x27; earlier &quot;Safe at Home&quot;. Throughout April 1968, McGuinn came under considerable pressure from Parsons to recruit Maness as a full member of the Byrds, so that the band&#x27;s new country material would sound authentic in concert, but McGuinn resisted, although Maness has stated in interview that he declined the invitation anyway. Having failed to recruit Maness as a permanent member of the band, Parsons next recommended another pedal steel guitar player, Sneaky Pete Kleinow, but once again, McGuinn held firm. Parsons&#x27; attempts to recruit new members and dictate the band&#x27;s musical direction caused a power struggle within the band, with McGuinn finding his position as band leader challenged by Parsons, who was also pushing for a higher salary. At one point Parsons even demanded that the album be billed as &quot;Gram Parsons and the Byrds&quot;, a demand that was ignored by McGuinn and Hillman.

In May 1968 the band embarked on a short European tour and while in England for concerts at the Middle Earth Club and Blaises, the Byrds met with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards who both expressed concern over the Byrds&#x27; intention to tour South Africa during the summer. McGuinn remained undaunted regarding these concerns over the country&#x27;s apartheid policies, having already received the blessing of South African singer Miriam Makeba. He convinced the rest of the Byrds that a trip to South Africa would be an interesting experience. This meeting between the Byrds and the two Rolling Stones would play an important part in Parsons&#x27; departure from the band two months later.

==Post-production==
Upon the group&#x27;s return to California, post-production work on the &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; album was disrupted when Parsons&#x27; appearance on the album was contested by Lee Hazlewood, who contended that the singer was still under contract to his LHI record label. While the legal problems were being resolved, McGuinn replaced three of Parsons&#x27; lead vocals with his own singing, a move that still infuriated Parsons as late as 1973, when he told Cameron Crowe in an interview that McGuinn &quot;erased it and did the vocals himself and fucked it up.&quot; However, Parsons was still featured singing lead vocals on the songs &quot;Hickory Wind&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Still on My Mind&quot;, and &quot;Life in Prison&quot;. There has been speculation that McGuinn&#x27;s decision to re-record Parsons&#x27; lead vocals himself was not entirely motivated by the threat of legal action, but by a desire to decrease Parsons&#x27; presence on the album. According to producer Gary Usher:


The three songs that had their lead vocals replaced by McGuinn were &quot;The Christian Life&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Miss Your Water&quot;, and &quot;One Hundred Years from Now&quot;, with the last featuring McGuinn and Hillman sharing vocals on the final album version. However, Parsons&#x27; lead vocals weren&#x27;t completely eradicated from these songs and can still be faintly heard, despite having either McGuinn or Hillman&#x27;s voice overdubbed on them. The master recordings of these three songs, with their original Parsons&#x27; vocals restored to full prominence, were finally issued as part of &quot;The Byrds&quot; box set in 1990. These same master recordings, featuring Parsons&#x27; lead vocals, were also included as bonus tracks on disc one of the 2003 Legacy Edition of &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;.

With the legal problems surrounding Parsons&#x27; appearance on the album resolved, the Byrds returned to England for an appearance at the Royal Albert Hall on July 7, 1968. Following the concert, Parsons announced that he would not be accompanying the band on their imminent tour of South Africa in protest over the country&#x27;s policies of apartheid (a policy that did not cease until 1994). Both McGuinn and Hillman doubted the sincerity of Parsons&#x27; protest, believing instead that Parsons had used the apartheid issue as a convenient excuse to leave the band and stay in England to hang out with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Consequently, by the time &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was released in August 1968, Parsons had been an ex-member of the Byrds for almost eight weeks. Following the South African tour, McGuinn and Hillman replaced Parsons with longtime Byrd-in-waiting Clarence White, and Kevin Kelley was dismissed from the band soon after. In total, the McGuinn, Hillman, Parsons, and Kelley line-up of the Byrds had lasted a mere five months.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was released on August 30, 1968, in the United States (catalogue item CS 9670) and September 27, 1968, in the UK (catalogue item 63353). However, there is some doubt about the American release date, as the album was first listed on the U.S. charts in the August 24 issue of &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine and therefore must have been on sale a few weeks earlier than August 30.

It was the first Byrds LP to be issued exclusively in stereo in the United States, although the album was released in both mono and stereo variations in the United Kingdom. Columbia Records launched an accompanying print advertising campaign proclaiming, &quot;This Country&#x27;s for the Byrds&quot; and featuring the tag line &quot;Their message is all country … their sound is all Byrds.&quot; In spite of this, &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; only reached number 77 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, during a chart stay of ten weeks, and failed to chart in the United Kingdom at all. The lead single from the album was a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Nowhere&quot;, which was released on April 2, 1968, climbing to number 75 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 45 in the UK charts. A second single from the album, &quot;I Am a Pilgrim&quot;, was released on September 2, 1968, but failed to chart. The album cover artwork was adapted by Geller and Butler Advertising from elements of the 1932 poster &quot;The American Cowboy Rodeo/Evolution of the Cowboy&quot; by Uruguyan artist Jo Mora.

Despite receiving generally favorable reviews from the critics, the country-rock style of &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was such a radical departure from the band&#x27;s previous sound that large sections of the group&#x27;s counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, said of the album: &quot;The new Byrds do not sound like Buck Owens &amp; his Buckaroos. They aren&#x27;t that good. The material they&#x27;ve chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It&#x27;s not pretentious, it&#x27;s pretty. The musician-ship is excellent.&quot; Gifford added that &quot;The Byrds have made an interesting album. It&#x27;s really very uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It ought to make the &#x27;Easy-Listening&#x27; charts. &#x27;Bringing it all back home&#x27; has never been an easy thing to do.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album in a September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: &quot;The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today.&quot; Landau added that &quot;they leave just enough rock in the drums to let you know that they can still play rock &amp; roll.&quot; In a 1969 article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Robert Christgau described &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; as &quot;a bittersweet tribute to country music&quot;.

Among the less favorable contemporary critiques, a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reviewer dismissed the album as &quot;Not typical Byrds music, which is rather a pity.&quot; Writing in &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; just before he withdrew from city life and temporarily retired from music journalism, Paul Williams dismissed both the Byrds&#x27; album and &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; for providing &quot;wonderful stifling inertia&quot; that is only good for relaxation, writing: &quot;I guess this isn&#x27;t the summer to look to be rescued by music.&quot; Robert Shelton of &quot;The New York Times&quot; similarly commented that &quot;The latest Byrds album adheres to most of the &#x27;rules of the game&#x27; about country sound, and yet, sad to say, to this old fan of the Byrds, the album is a distinguished bore.&quot;

In more recent years, AllMusic critic Mark Deming remarked in his review of the album that &quot;no major band had gone so deep into the sound and feeling of classic country (without parody or condescension) as the Byrds did on Sweetheart; at a time when most rock fans viewed country as a musical &quot;L&#x27;il Abner&quot; routine, the Byrds dared to declare that C&amp;W could be hip, cool, and heartfelt.&quot; Alexander Lloyd Linhardt, reviewing the album for &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot;, described it as &quot;a blindingly rusty gait through parched weariness and dusted reverie. It&#x27;s not the natural sound of Death Valley or Utah, but rather, a false portrait by people who wished it was, which makes it even more melancholy and charismatic.&quot; Journalist Matthew Weiner commented in his review for &quot;Stylus&quot; that &quot;Thirty-five years after it startled Byrds fans everywhere with its Podunk proclivities, Sweetheart remains a particularly fascinating example of two musical ships passing in the night, documenting both Parsons’ transformation into a visionary country-rock auteur and a pop band&#x27;s remarkable sense of artistic risk.&quot;

The Byrds&#x27; biographer, Johnny Rogan, has said that the album &quot;stood alone as a work almost completely divorced from the prevailing rock culture. Its themes, mood and instrumentation looked back to another era at a time when the rest of America was still recovering from the recent assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy.&quot; Ultimately, the Byrds&#x27; experimentation with the country genre on &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was slightly ahead of its time, to the detriment of the band&#x27;s commercial fortunes, as the international success of country rock-flavored bands like the Eagles, America and Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show during the 1970s demonstrated.

==Legacy==
Released at a time when the Byrds&#x27; surprising immersion in the world of country music coincided with their declining commercial appeal, &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was an uncommercial proposition. However, the album has proved to be a landmark, serving not only as a blueprint for Parsons&#x27; and Hillman&#x27;s the Flying Burrito Brothers, but also for the entire nascent 1970s Los Angeles country rock movement. The album was also influential on the outlaw country and new traditionalist movements, as well as the so-called alternative country genre of the 1990s and early 21st century. Among fans of the Byrds, however, opinion is often sharply divided regarding the merits of the album, with some seeing it as a natural continuation of the group&#x27;s innovations, and others mourning the loss of the band&#x27;s trademark Rickenbacker guitar jangle and psychedelic experimentation. Nonetheless, &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; is widely considered by critics to be the Byrds&#x27; last truly influential album.

Although it was not the first country rock album, &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was the first album widely labeled as country rock to be released by an internationally successful rock act, pre-dating the release of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; by over six months. The first bona fide country rock album is often cited as being &quot;Safe at Home&quot; by Parsons&#x27; previous group, The International Submarine Band. However, the genre&#x27;s antecedents can be traced back to the Rockabilly music of the 1950s, the Beatles&#x27; covers of Carl Perkins and Buck Owens&#x27; material on &quot;Beatles For Sale&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;, as well as the stripped down arrangements of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; album and the Byrds&#x27; own forays into country music on their pre-&quot;Sweetheart&quot; albums. The Band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;, released in July 1968, was also influential on the genre, but it was &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; that saw an established rock band playing pure country music for the first time.

The album was included in &quot;A Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In 2003, the album was ranked number 117 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, 120 in a 2012 revised list, and 274 in a 2020 revised list. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; named it their 175th favorite album of all time also in 2003. It was voted number 229 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).

&quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; went on to inspire the name of the 1980s country duo, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, who paid tribute to the Byrds&#x27; album with the sleeve of their 1990 album, &quot;Buffalo Zone&quot;.

In 2018, Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman reunited for a U.S. tour celebrating the 50th anniversary of &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;. The duo, who were backed on the tour by Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives, performed all of the songs from the album and told stories about its creation. 
A live album of recordings from the 50th Anniversary concerts was released for Record Store Day 2024.

&quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was remastered at 20-bit resolution as part of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds series and reissued in an expanded form on March 25, 1997. The eight bonus tracks featured on this reissue include the outtakes &quot;You Got a Reputation&quot;, &quot;Lazy Days&quot;, and &quot;Pretty Polly&quot;, as well as four previously unreleased rehearsal takes and an instrumental backing track for &quot;All I Have Are Memories&quot;. A hidden track on the CD features a 1968 Columbia Records radio advertisement for the album.

On September 2, 2003, a 2 CD Legacy Edition of &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; was released by Columbia/Legacy. This version of the album features additional outtakes, rehearsal versions, and the master takes of the songs that had their Parsons&#x27; lead vocals replaced, presented here with their Parsons&#x27; vocals intact. Most of the alternate versions and rehearsal takes on disc two of the Legacy Edition feature Parsons singing songs that were later released with vocals by McGuinn on the original album. Also included on the Legacy Edition is an outtake from the album sessions called &quot;All I Have Are Memories&quot;, written and sung by drummer Kevin Kelley. In addition, the Legacy Edition of &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; includes six tracks performed by the International Submarine Band (Parsons&#x27; previous group).

In 2007, Sundazed Music released a 7&quot; single featuring previously unreleased alternate versions of &quot;Lazy Days&quot; and &quot;You Got a Reputation&quot; (titled &quot;Reputation&quot; on this release) that date from the Byrds&#x27; March 1968 recording sessions in Nashville. These two alternate versions have not been issued on CD.

The 2003 CD reissue contains alternative versions of songs with Parsons singing lead, along with recordings by Parsons&#x27; pre-Byrds group, The International Submarine Band (tracks 1–6 on disc two).

<text>Legionella is a genus of gram-negative bacteria that can be seen using a silver stain or grown in a special media that contains cysteine, an amino acid. It is known to cause legionellosis (all illnesses caused by &quot;Legionella&quot;) including a pneumonia-type illness called Legionnaires&#x27; disease and a mild flu-like illness called Pontiac fever. These bacteria are common in many places, like soil and water. There are over 50 species and 70 types (serogroups) identified. &quot;Legionella&quot; does not spread from person-to-person. Most individuals who are exposed to the bacteria do not get sick. Most outbreaks result from poorly maintained cooling towers.

The cell wall of the &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria has parts that determine its specific type. The structural arrangement and building blocks (sugars) in the cell wall help classify the bacteria.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Legionella&quot; was named after a 1976 outbreak of a then-unknown &quot;mystery disease&quot; at a convention of the American Legion, an association of U.S. military veterans, in Philadelphia. This outbreak happened within days of the 200th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which led to it being highly publicized and caused great concern in the U.S. On January 18, 1977, the causative agent was identified as a previously unknown bacterium subsequently named &quot;Legionella&quot;.

== Detection ==
The detection of &quot;Legionella&quot; typically requires growing them on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar. As &quot;Legionella&quot; growth requires cysteine and iron, it cannot grow on other common lab media.

To detect &quot;Legionella&quot; in water, it is first concentrated, then inoculated into charcoal yeast extract agar containing selective agents that prevent the growth of other organisms. Heat or acid treatments are sometimes used to eliminate other microbes in a sample.

After incubation for up to 10 days, the presence of &quot;Legionella&quot; can be confirmed if colonies grow agar with cysteine but not on agar without it. Immunological techniques are then commonly used to determine the species and/or serogroups of bacteria present in the sample.

Some hospitals use the &quot;Legionella&quot; urinary antigen test when &quot;Legionella&quot; pneumonia is suspected. This test is faster and uses a urine instead of a sputum sample, giving results in hours compared to days. However, it only detects one type of &quot;Legionella&quot;: &quot;Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1&quot; (LP1). Non-LP1 strains require can only be detected through culturing.

Methods, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid immunological tests, can detect &quot;Legionella&quot; in water much faster.

Government health surveillance reports have shown an increase in the proportion of water-related &quot;Legionella&quot; outbreaks, particularly in healthcare settings.

Genomic analyses of &quot;Legionella&quot; has resulted in the identification of 24 conserved signature indels (CSIs) in diverse proteins including 30S ribosomal protein S8, periplasmic serine endoprotease DegP precursor, DNA polymerase I, and ABC transporter permease, that are specifically present in different species of the &quot;Legionella&quot;. These markers can help distinguish &quot;Legionella&quot; from other types of bacteria, improving diagnosis.

=== Sources ===
Documented sources include cooling towers, swimming pools, domestic water systems and showers, ice-making machines, refrigerated cabinets, whirlpool spas, hot springs, fountains, dental equipment, soil, automobile windshield washer fluid (especially if filled with water instead of wiper fluid), industrial coolant, and waste water treatment plants.

The following are not sources of infection: home/car/window (as seen in some hotels) air-conditioning units that do not use water to cool air.

==== Airborne transmission ====
The bacteria can spread through tiny droplets of water that get into the air. People can breathe in these droplets, which then infect cells in the airways, resulting in illness. This is the most common way Legionella spreads.

==== Recreational exposure ====
Cooling towers are well established as sources of &quot;Legionella&quot; that may have an effect on community exposure to the bacterium and Legionnaires&#x27; disease epidemics. In addition to cooling towers, use of swimming pools, spa pools, and other recreational water bodies has also been shown to increase risk of exposure to &quot;Legionella&quot;, though this differs by species of &quot;Legionella&quot;. In a review of disease caused by recreational exposure to &quot;Legionella&quot;, most exposures occurred in spas or pools used by the public (hotels or recreational centers) or in natural settings (hot springs or thermal water).

Hotels and other tourist destinations have contributed to &quot;Legionella&quot; exposure. The relative danger at commonly used facilities with heating and cooling water systems depends on several factors, such as the water source, how much &quot;Legionella&quot; is present (if there is any), if and how the water system is treated, how people are interacting with this water, and other factors that make the water systems so dynamic.

In addition to tourists and other recreators, gardeners may be at increased risk for exposure to &quot;Legionella&quot;. In some countries (like Australia), &quot;Legionella&quot; lives in soil and compost. Warmer temperatures and increased rainfall in some regions of the world due to climate change may impact &quot;Legionella&quot; in soil, gardeners&#x27; seasonal exposure to contaminated soil, and complex water systems used by the public.

==== Exposure related to natural disasters and climate change ====
Not only are &quot;Legionella&quot; spp. present in artificial water systems and infrastructure, but also these bacteria live in natural bodies of water, such as lakes and rivers. Weather patterns and other environmental factors may increase risk of &quot;Legionella&quot; outbreaks; a study in Minnesota, USA, using outbreak information from 2011 to 2018 showed precipitation as having the greatest effect of increasing risk of &quot;Legionella&quot; exposure when taking into account other environmental factors (temperature, relative humidity, land use and age of infected person). Weather patterns heavily relate to the established infrastructure and water sources, especially in urban settings. In the US, most cases of &quot;Legionella&quot; infection have occurred in the summertime, though they were likely more associated with rainfall and humidity than summer temperatures. Severe rain patterns can increase risk of water source contamination through flooding and unseasonable rains; therefore, natural disasters, especially those associated with climate change, may increase risk of exposure to &quot;Legionella&quot;.

=== Vaccine research ===
No vaccine is available for legionellosis. Vaccination studies using heat-killed or acetone-killed cells have been carried out in guinea pigs, which were then given &quot;Legionella&quot; intraperitoneally or by aerosol. Both vaccines were shown to give moderately high levels of protection. Protection was dose-dependent and correlated with antibody levels as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to an outer membrane antigen and by indirect immunofluorescence to heat-killed cells.

== Molecular biology ==
&quot;Legionella&quot; is a genetically diverse species with 7-11% of genes being strain-specific. The molecular function of some of the proven virulence factors of &quot;Legionella&quot; have been discovered.

== &quot;Legionella&quot; disease manifestation ==
=== Signs and symptoms ===
Legionella pneumonia, often called &quot;atypical pneumonia,&quot; is the most common form of legionellosis. The early symptoms are general, including fever, muscle pain, headache, shortness of breath, and a dry or productive cough. Patients with pneumonia who also have neurological or gastrointestinal symptoms like loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting may be more likely to have legionellosis. A physical examination may reveal abnormal lungs sounds such as rales or rhonchi, and if consolidation is present, there may be signs like egophony or dullness to percussion. Laboratory tests might show either a high or low white blood cell count, low platelets, elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST), low sodium levels, and possibly decreased kidney function.

Another form of legionellosis is Pontiac fever, which resembles the flu and includes symptoms like fever, headache, muscle pain, chills, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This form is milder than Legionella pneumonia and typically resolves on its own.

In some cases, &quot;Legionella&quot; can cause infections outside the lungs, including skin and soft tissue infections similar to cellulitis. This is especially a concern if contaminated water comes into contact with surgical wounds. It can also lead to heart infections, such as prosthetic valve endocarditis (without positive blood cultures), myocarditis, and pericarditis. In rare cases, &quot;Legionella&quot; species have been linked to joint infections (example: septic arthritis) and sinusitis.

=== Pathogenesis ===

In nature, &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria live inside tiny organisms, like amoebae (examples: &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; spp., &quot;Naegleria&quot; spp., &quot;Vermamoeba&quot; spp., or other protozoa such as &quot;Tetrahymena pyriformis&quot;). These amoebae are found in water and soil. They are found in low amounts in natural water sources like lakes and streams, but can grow quickly in man-made water systems under the right conditions.

&quot;Legionella&quot; is spread through inhaling contaminated water droplets, which can come from mists, sprays, or other sources that release tiny droplets into the air. In homes, the most common sources of exposure are shower heads and sinks. The incubation period, or the time it takes for symptoms to appear, is usually 2-10 days for Legionella pneumonia and 24-72 hours for Pontiac fever. In rare cases, infection can also happen if people accidentally breathe in drinking water. Person-to-person spread has not been proven, but could be possible in rare situations.

Most healthy people don&#x27;t get severely sick. The risk of &quot;Legionella&quot; infection is higher in adults, especially those over 40 years old. People with certain health conditions, like kidney or liver disease, chronic lung disease, or heart disease, are at a greater risk. Those with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients or organ transplant recipients, are at risk as well. People with chronic illnesses, like autoimmune disease treated with TNF inhibitors, also face a higher risk of infection. Men are about three times more likely than women to get infected, while children are less likely to develop severe cases. Smoking, including cannabis smoking, is strongly linked to increased risk due to damage to the airway lining.

Hospitals and nursing homes are especially concerned about water system safety because vulnerable patients are at a higher risk. For example, the Texas Department of State Health Services, has guidelines for hospitals to stop the spread of &quot;Legionella&quot;.

In the United States, &quot;Legionella&quot; infects about 8,000 to 18,000 people each year. Preventing exposure to contaminated water droplets remains key to reducing spread.

=== Mechanism ===
After inhaling or accidentally swallowing small aerosol particles, &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria attach to immune cells and are taken up by them through a process called phagocytosis. Inside the body, the bacteria can grow and multiple in lung cells, specifically alveolar macrophages and monocytes.

&quot;Legionella&quot; has several ways to evade the immune system, increasing the chance that a person develops symptoms of infection. It creates special vacuoles, or protective bubbles, inside immune cells to hide from the body&#x27;s defenses. It also reduces the activity of cytokine receptors (which play a role in immune response), blocks the production of certain proteins needed by the host, and avoids being broken down by lysosomes, which are cell structures meant to digest harmful particles.

=== Diagnosis ===
&quot;Legionella&quot; is usually diagnosed using a urinary antigen test. Some patients, especially those in the ICU or those who cannot provide a sputum sample, may need an invasive procedure, such as a bronchoscopy, if the initial urinary antigen test is negative. For the most accurate diagnosis, doctors may take cultures from sputum, fluid from the lungs (called bronchoalveolar lavage), lung tissue, or other affected areas. These cultures are considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for confirming &quot;Legionella&quot; infection.

=== Prevention and screening ===
Preventing &quot;Legionella&quot; infection starts with improving water systems and setting up water-monitoring processes to keep it under control. In the U.S., prevention efforts focus mainly on health care settings, especially hospitals, where water-based exposures are more likely to be fatal. Federal guidelines to reduce &quot;Legionella&quot; risks were first introduced in June 2017, requiring all medical centers to monitor water quality and have systems in place to prevent hospital-acquired Legionella pneumonia. Facilities with water features, like therapy pools, ice machines, and decorative fountains, must have cleaning and disinfection policies.

To remove &quot;Legionella&quot; from water systems, chemical disinfectants are often added. Water filtration can also be used, either at the plumbing level or at specific points of use, as a primary or combined prevention method. Using disinfectants requires regular maintenance and monitoring of chemical levels to ensure they&#x27;re effective in preventing &quot;Legionella&quot; growth.

=== Treatment ===
Antibiotics are usually the first choice when treating community-acquired pneumonia, which may or may not be caused by &quot;Legionella&quot;. The first-line options when &quot;Legionella&quot; is the causative agent are macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Azithromycin, a type of macrolide, is the preferred choice. For patients with mild illness, the treatment course usually lasts about 10-14 days, although most symptoms tend to improve within the first 3-5 days of starting the antibiotics. For patients who are immunosuppressed or have severe cases of &quot;Legionella&quot; pneumonia, a longer treatment course of three weeks is recommended to ensure effective recovery.

=== Outcomes and prognosis ===
Even with the right treatment, &quot;Legionella&quot; pneumonia can lead to serious health problems and can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate for this type of pneumonia is about 10%, and patients who are admitted to the ICU or have other major health issues are more likely to die from it. If there is a delay in starting antibiotic treatment, the risk of death can be about three times higher compared to those who receive treatment promptly. Among patients who develop pneumonia in the hospital, especially cases caused by &quot;Legionella&quot;, the death rate is around 25%. For those who are immunocompromised, the mortality rate can be as high as 30-50%.

After surviving &quot;Legionella&quot; pneumonia, many patients experience long-term complications, with more than 25% facing ongoing issues such as recurrent hospitalizations, acute kidney failure, lung problems, and recurring pneumonia. On the other hand, recover from Pontiac fever usually occurs within 3-5 days, and serious complications or death related to Pontiac fever are very rare.

=== Epidemiology ===
&quot;Legionella&quot; is responsible for more than 50% of all waterborne outbreaks and over 10% of diseases related to drinking water in the U.S. The incidence of legionellosis, or Legionella infection, is about 2 to 3 cases for every 100,000 people; however, the true number of cases is likely higher than reported. This is because many studies on community-acquired pneumonia do not routinely test for &quot;Legionella&quot;, meaning some cases may go undetected.

=== History ===
Examples of common-source outbreaks:

* 2001 Spain; source: cooling tower; 449 documented cases of Legionnaires&#x27; disease
* 2012: Hotel; source: potable water, fountain, spa; # cases: 89 (+29 suspected)
* 2012: Hospital; source: potable water; # cases: 22
* 2014: Community; source: cooling tower; # cases: 334
* 2014-2015: Hospital/community; source: potable water, household, cooling towers; # case: 86
* 2015: Long-term care facility; source: potable water; # cases: 74
* 2018: Hospital; source: potable water, showers; # cases: 128
* 2019: Hotel; source: fountain; # cases: 13 (+66 suspected)
* 2019: Community; source: hot tub display; # cases: 141

== &quot;Legionella&quot; control and biomonitoring ==
Control of &quot;Legionella&quot; growth can occur through chemical, thermal or ultraviolet treatment methods.

=== Heat ===
One option is temperature control—i.e., keeping all cold water below and all hot water above .

Temperature affects the survival of &quot;Legionella&quot; as follows:
* Above – &quot;Legionella&quot; dies almost instantly
* At – 90% die in 2 minutes (Decimal reduction time (D) = 2 minutes)
* At – 90% die in 80–124 minutes, depending on strain (D = 80–124 minutes)
* – can survive but do not multiply
* – ideal growth range
* – growth range
* Below – can survive, but are dormant

Other temperature sensitivity:
* to – Disinfection range
* – &quot;Legionella&quot; dies within 2 minutes
* – &quot;Legionella&quot; dies within 32 minutes
* – &quot;Legionella&quot; dies within 5 to 6 hours

Water temperature can be monitored in real-time with electronic devices.

=== Controlling &quot;Legionella&quot; in potable water systems ===
Potable water refers to hot or cold water that is intended for drinking. The CDC recommends that hot water is kept between and and that cold water is stored below . It is also recommended to flush infrequently used fixtures regularly.

=== In building water systems ===
==== Chlorine ====
A very effective chemical treatment is chlorine. For systems with marginal issues, chlorine provides effective results at &gt;0.5 ppm residual in the hot water system. For systems with significant &quot;Legionella&quot; problems, temporary shock chlorination—where levels are raised to higher than 2 ppm for a period of 24 hours or more and then returned to 0.5 ppm—may be effective. Hyperchlorination can also be used where the water system is taken out of service and the chlorine residual is raised to 50 ppm or higher at all distal points for 24 hours or more. The system is then flushed and returned to 0.5 ppm chlorine prior to being placed back into service. These high levels of chlorine penetrate biofilm, killing both the &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria and the host organisms. Annual hyperchlorination can be an effective part of a comprehensive &quot;Legionella&quot; preventive action plan.

==== Copper-silver ionization ====
Copper-silver ionization is recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and WHO for &quot;Legionella&quot; control and prevention. It is a popular method used in building water systems to control &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria, mainly because it is affordable and does not require much maintenance. In this method, the copper ions weaken the bacteria&#x27;s cell wall, allowing silver ions to then disrupt the bacteria&#x27;s DNA and proteins, preventing further proliferation. Copper and silver ion concentrations must be maintained at optimal levels, taking into account both water flow and overall water usage, to control &quot;Legionella&quot;.

Copper-silver ionization is an effective process to control &quot;Legionella&quot; in potable water distribution systems found in health facilities, hotels, nursing homes, and most large buildings. However, it is not intended for cooling towers because of pH levels greater than 8.6, that cause ionic copper to precipitate. Furthermore, tolyltriazole, a common additive in cooling water treatment, could bind the copper making it ineffective. Ionization became the first such hospital disinfection process to have fulfilled a proposed four-step modality evaluation; by then, it had been adopted by over 100 hospitals. Copper-silver ionization works slower than other disinfectants and is affected by the water&#x27;s chemical makeup.

==== Chlorine dioxide ====
Chlorine dioxide has been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a primary disinfectant of potable water since 1945. Chlorine dioxide does not produce any carcinogenic byproducts like some other chlorine sources when used in the purification of drinking water that contains natural organic compounds such as humic and fulvic acids; trihalomethanes may be formed. Drinking water containing such molecules has been shown to increase the risk of cancer.

Since chlorine dioxide stays as a gas, it is easier for it to enter microorganisms to disrupt their internal functions. It works better than chlorine when it comes to disrupting biofilms and is effective across a wider pH range. Testing has demonstrated that low levels of chlorine dioxide reduced Legionella bacteria to undetectable levels in 6 days; however, its effectiveness can be reduced when amoebae are present. It is also not widely distributed in water systems due to concerns regarding its toxicity, unpleasant odors, and harmful byproducts, as stated above, that it can create.

Monochloramine is an alternative. It is created by mixing chlorine and ammonia and valued for its stability and ability to penetrate biofilms better than chlorine. Like chlorine and chlorine dioxide, monochloramine is approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a primary potable water disinfectant. Environmental Protection Agency registration requires a biocide label, which lists toxicity and other data required for all registered biocides.

It does work slower than chlorine and requires precise chemical management due to concerns for toxicity.

==== Ultraviolet light ====
Ultraviolet light, in the range of 200 to 300 nm, can inactivate Legionella. According to a review by the US EPA, three-log (99.9%) inactivation can be achieved with a dose of less than 7 mJ/cm2.

==== Biomonitoring ====
A &quot;Legionella&quot;-specific aptamer has been discovered and in 2022 was developed into an assay for detecting to a limit of 104.3 cells/mL with no processing steps.

== European standards ==
Several European countries established the European Working Group for Legionella Infections to share knowledge and experience about monitoring potential sources of &quot;Legionella&quot;. The working group has published guidelines about the actions to be taken to limit the number of colony-forming units (that is, live bacteria that are able to multiply) of &quot;Legionella&quot; per litre:

Monitoring guidelines are stated in Approved Code of Practice L8 in the UK. These are not mandatory, but are widely regarded as so. An employer or property owner must follow an Approved Code of Practice, or achieve the same result. Failure to show monitoring records to at least this standard has resulted in several high-profile prosecutions, e.g. Nalco + Bulmers – neither could prove a sufficient scheme to be in place while investigating an outbreak, therefore both were fined about £300,000GBP. Important case law in this area is R v Trustees of the Science Museum 3 All ER 853, (1993) 1 WLR 1171

Employers and those responsible for premises within the UK are required under Control of Substances Hazardous to Health to undertake an assessment of the risks arising from Legionella. This risk assessment may be very simple for low risk premises, however for larger or higher risk properties may include a narrative of the site, asset register, simplified schematic drawings, recommendations on compliance, and a proposed monitoring scheme.

The L8 Approved Code of Practice recommends that the risk assessment should be reviewed at least every 2 years and whenever a reason exists to suspect it is no longer valid, such as water systems have been amended or modified, or if the use of the water system has changed, or if there is reason to suspect that Legionella control measures are no longer working.

== Weaponization ==
&quot;Legionella&quot; can be used as a weapon, and indeed genetic modification of &quot;L. pneumophila&quot; has been shown where the mortality rate in infected animals can be increased to nearly 100%. A former Soviet bioengineer, Sergei Popov, stated in 2000 that his team experimented with genetically enhanced bioweapons, including &quot;Legionella&quot;. Popov worked as a lead researcher at the Vector Institute from 1976 to 1986, then at Obolensk until 1992, when he defected to the West. He later divulged much of the Soviet biological weapons program and settled in the United States.

<text>The Alpine chough () or yellow-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus) is a bird in the crow family, one of only two species in the genus &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot;. Its two subspecies breed in high mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and North Africa to Central Asia and Nepal, and it may nest at a higher altitude than any other bird. The eggs have adaptations to the thin atmosphere that improve oxygen take-up and reduce water loss.

This bird has glossy black plumage, a yellow beak, red legs, and distinctive calls. It has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely spread flight feathers. The Alpine chough pairs for life and displays fidelity to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face. It builds a lined stick nest and lays three to five brown-blotched whitish eggs. It feeds, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey in summer and fruit in winter; it will readily approach tourist sites to find supplementary food.

Although it is subject to predation and parasitism, and changes in agricultural practices have caused local population declines, this widespread and abundant species is not threatened globally. Climate change may present a long-term threat, by shifting the necessary Alpine habitat to higher altitudes.

==Taxonomy==
The Alpine chough was first described as &quot;Corvus graculus&quot; by Linnaeus in the &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1766. It was moved to its current genus, &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot;, by English ornithologist Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 &quot;Ornithologia Britannica&quot;, along with the only other member of the genus, the red-billed chough, &quot;P. pyrrhocorax&quot;. The closest relatives of the choughs were formerly thought to be the typical crows, &quot;Corvus&quot;, especially the jackdaws in the subgenus &quot;Coloeus&quot;, but DNA and cytochrome b analysis shows that the genus &quot;Pyrrhocorax&quot;, along with the ratchet-tailed treepie (genus &quot;Temnurus&quot;), diverged early from the rest of the Corvidae.

The genus name is derived from Greek , &quot;flame-coloured&quot;, and , &quot;raven&quot;. The species epithet &quot;graculus&quot; is Latin for a jackdaw. The current binomial name of the Alpine chough was formerly sometimes applied to the red-billed chough. The English word &quot;chough&quot; was originally an alternative onomatopoeic name for the jackdaw, &quot;Corvus monedula&quot;, based on its call. The red-billed chough, formerly particularly common in Cornwall and known initially as the &quot;Cornish chough&quot;, eventually became just &quot;chough&quot;, the name transferring from one genus to another.

The Alpine chough has two extant subspecies.
* &quot;P. g. graculus&quot;, the nominate subspecies in Europe, north Africa, Turkey, the Caucasus and northern Iran.
* &quot;P. g. digitatus&quot;, described by the German naturalists Wilhelm Hemprich and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg as &quot;P. alpinus&quot; var. &quot;digitatus&quot; in 1833, is larger and has stronger feet than the nominate race. It breeds in the rest of the depicted Asian range, mainly in the Himalayas.
Moravian palaeontologist Ferdinand Stoliczka separated the Himalayan population as a third subspecies, &quot;P. g. forsythi&quot;, but this has not been widely accepted and is usually treated as synonymous with &quot;digitatus&quot;. A Pleistocene form from Europe was similar to the extant subspecies, and is sometimes categorised as &quot;P. g. vetus&quot;.

The Australian white-winged chough, &quot;Corcorax melanorhamphos&quot;, despite its similar bill shape and black plumage, is only distantly related to the true choughs.

==Description==

The adult of the nominate subspecies of the Alpine chough has glossy black plumage, a short yellow bill, dark brown irises, and red legs. It is slightly smaller than the red-billed chough, at length with a tail and a wingspan, but has a proportionally longer tail and shorter wings. It has a similar buoyant and easy flight. The sexes are identical in appearance, although the male averages slightly larger than the female. The juvenile is duller than the adult, with a dull yellow bill and brownish legs. The Alpine chough is unlikely to be confused with any other species; although the jackdaw and red-billed chough share its range, the jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the red-billed chough has a long red bill.

The subspecies &quot;P. g. digitatus&quot; averages slightly larger than the nominate form, weighing against for &quot;P. g. graculus&quot;, and it has stronger feet. This is in accordance with Bergmann&#x27;s rule, which predicts that the largest birds should be found higher elevations or in colder and more arid regions. The extremities of the body, the bill and tarsus, are longer in warmer areas, in line with Allen&#x27;s rule. Temperature seems to be the most important cause of body variation in the Alpine chough.

The flight of the Alpine chough is swift and acrobatic with loose, deep wing beats. Its high manoeuvrability is accomplished by fanning the tail, folding its wings, and soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from the red-billed chough by its less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.

The rippling and whistled calls of the Alpine chough are quite different from the more typically crow-like vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red-billed chough. It also has a rolling alarm call, and a variety of quiet warbles and squeaks given by resting or feeding birds. In a study of chough calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in the Alpine chough showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Alpine chough breeds in mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and the Alps across Central Asia and the Himalayas to western China. There are also populations in Morocco, Corsica and Crete. It is a non-migratory resident throughout its range, although Moroccan birds have established a small colony near Málaga in southern Spain, and wanderers have reached Czechoslovakia, Gibraltar, Hungary and Cyprus.

This is a high-altitude species normally breeding between in Europe, in Morocco, and in the Himalayas. It has nested at , higher than any other bird species, surpassing even the red-billed chough, which has a diet less well adapted to the highest altitudes. It has been observed following mountaineers ascending Mount Everest at an altitude of . It usually nests in cavities and fissures on inaccessible rock faces, although locally it will use holes between rocks in fields, and forages in open habitats such as alpine meadows and scree slopes to the tree line or lower, and in winter will often congregate around human settlements, ski resorts, hotels and other tourist facilities. Its penchant for waiting by hotel windows for food is popular with tourists, but less so with hotel owners.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===

The Alpine chough is socially monogamous, showing high partner fidelity in summer and winter and from year to year. Nesting typically starts in early May, and is non-colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity. The bulky nests are composed of roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair, and may be constructed on ledges, in a cave or similar fissure in a cliff face, or in an abandoned building. The clutch is 3–5 glossy whitish eggs, averaging in size, which are tinged with buff, cream or light-green and marked with small brown blotches; they are incubated by the female for 14–21 days before hatching. The chicks hatch with a dense covering of natal down — in contrast to those of the red-billed chough, which are almost naked — and fledge 29–31 days from hatching. The young birds are fed by both parents, and may also be fed by other adults when they have fledged and joined the flock. Breeding is possible in the high mountains because chough eggs have fewer pores than those of lowland species, reducing loss of water by evaporation at the low atmospheric pressure. The embryos of bird species that breed at high altitude also have haemoglobin with a genetically determined high affinity for oxygen.

In the western Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests in a greater variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and abandoned buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.

A study of three different European populations showed a mean clutch size of 3.6 eggs, producing 2.6 chicks, of which 1.9 fledged. Adult survival rate varied from 83 to 92%, with no significant difference detected between males and females. Survival of first-year birds was, at 77%, lower than that of adults. The availability or otherwise of human food supplied from tourist activities did not affect breeding success.

===Feeding===

In the summer, the Alpine chough feeds mainly on invertebrates collected from pasture, such as beetles (&quot;Selatosomus aeneus&quot; and &quot;Otiorhynchus morio&quot; have been recorded from pellets), snails, grasshoppers, caterpillars and fly larvae. The diet in autumn, winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit, including berries such as the European Hackberry (&quot;Celtis australis&quot;) and Sea-buckthorn (&quot;Hippophae rhamnoides&quot;), rose hips, and domesticated crops such as apples, grapes and pears where available. It has been observed eating flowers of &quot;Crocus vernus albiflorus&quot;, including the pistils, perhaps as a source of carotenoids. The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Where additional food is available, winter flocks are larger and contain a high proportion of immature birds. The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability, such as refuse dumps. Both chough species will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.

This bird always forages in groups, which are larger in winter than summer, and have constant composition in each season. Where food resources are restricted, adults dominate young birds, and males outrank females. Foraging areas change altitudinally through the year, depending on climatic factors, food availability and food quality. During the breeding season, birds remain above the tree line, although they may use food provided by tourists at refuges and picnic areas.

Movement to lower levels begins after the first snowfalls, and feeding by day is mainly in or near valley bottoms when the snow cover deepens, although the birds return to the mountains to roost. In March and April the choughs frequent villages at valley tops or forage in snow-free patches prior to their return to the high meadows. Feeding trips may cover distance and in altitude. In the Alps, the development of skiing above has enabled more birds to remain at high levels in winter.

Where their ranges overlap, the two chough species may feed together in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively &quot;Gagea&quot; bulbs dug from the ground, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate crane fly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added crane fly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region and at the same time of year, which feed by digging in the soil of terraced pastures of villages.

===Natural threats===
Predators of the choughs include the peregrine falcon, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings.
Alpine choughs have been observed diving at a Tibetan red fox. It seems likely that this &quot;mobbing&quot; behaviour may be play activity to give practice for when genuine defensive measures may be needed to protect eggs or young.

The Alpine chough is a host of the widespread bird flea &quot;Ceratophyllus vagabunda&quot;, two specialist chough fleas &quot;Frontopsylla frontalis&quot; and &quot;F. laetus&quot;, a cestode &quot;Choanotaenia pirinica&quot;, and various species of chewing lice in the genera &quot;Brueelia&quot;, &quot;Menacanthus&quot; and &quot;Philopterus&quot;.

==Status==

The Alpine chough has an extensive though sometimes fragmented range, estimated at 1–10 million square kilometres (0.4–3.8 million sq mi), and a large population, including an estimated 260,000 to 620,000 individuals in Europe. The Corsican population has been estimated to comprise about 2,500 birds. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern.

At the greatest extent of the last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within the last couple of centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.

Choughs can be locally threatened by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species&#x27; preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.

<doc id="195773" wikidata="Q1671520" url="?curid=195773" title="Into the Pandemonium">
<text>Into the Pandemonium is the third studio album by Swiss extreme metal band Celtic Frost, released on 1 June 1987 through Noise Records in Europe, and through Combat Records in the US. The album marks the return of bassist and backing vocalist Martin Eric Ain, who had previously appeared on 1984&#x27;s &quot;Morbid Tales&quot;, but not on the band&#x27;s previous album.

The album furthers Celtic Frost&#x27;s experimental bent, with unlikely covers choices (Wall of Voodoo&#x27;s &quot;Mexican Radio&quot;), industrial-tinged tracks (&quot;One In their Pride&quot;) and gothic rock tendencies. The already traditional Frost-styled orchestral flourishes with female vocals are also present. Initially met with mixed reviews, &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;&#x27;s acceptance quickly grew and it became the band&#x27;s most successful record.

The album also marked the end of their tenure with Noise Records. A costly legal battle with the label ensued, due to accusations by the band that Noise sabotaged the album&#x27;s promotion.

==Production==
The rehearsals for the album started during the second half of 1986. The band early on discarded the working titles &quot;Silent Excess&quot; and &quot;Monumentum&quot; in favor of the familiar &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;.

Noise label boss Karl-Ulrich Walterbach &quot;didn&#x27;t get&quot; Celtic Frost&#x27;s new material, and threatened multiple times to defund the recording if they didn&#x27;t play run-on-the-mill thrash metal. This estrangement with the band&#x27;s left-field approach continued after the album&#x27;s release. During &quot;Pandemonium&quot;&#x27;s listening party at SPV&#x27;s offices Walterbach approached Warrior and asked, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you try to sound more like Exodus or Slayer?&quot; Walterbach&#x27;s sarcasm infuriated Frost&#x27;s main composer.

==Musical style==
The band had in mind the bold objective to surpass all their previous body of work. The push came largely from being blown away by the freshness of New wave. Every newly discovered record presented other musical vistas, a neverending supply of novel and original ideas. With this broadening of horizons, Celtic Frost were adamant that no set of rules would smother their creativity - especially those of extreme metal. “We hated these unwritten limitations in the metal scene,” Warrior reminisced. Chuck Eddy deems the group to be &quot;avant-gardy opportunists&quot; who—having recognised that both disco and heavy metal&#x27;s respective percussion elements &quot;in fact makes the phyla kissing cousins&quot;—effectively &quot;go disco&quot; on the record with the presence of specifically rhythm-based songs.

Both Warrior and Ain were post-punk devotees, especially of goth acts Bauhaus, Christian Death, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Sisters of Mercy. Paradise Lost main composer and guitarist Gregor Mackintosh spotted the Christian Death influence on Warrior&#x27;s new &quot;whiny&quot; vocal style, used throughout the album. In his opinion, it was &quot;lifted straight&quot; from the late Rozz Williams, especially his singing on &quot;Only Theatre Of Pain&quot;.

One particularly controversial portion of the album was the dance-oriented &quot;One In their Pride&quot;, a track built around soundbites from NASA&#x27;s Apollo program. Its use of sampling and drum machines reminded Belgian EBM group Front 242. Dan Lilker, former Anthrax and Nuclear Assault bassist, confessed his enstrangement with this track. Lilker said this enstrangement was generalized throughout the scene at the time. This was an instance where Tom Warrior acknowledged that the band &quot;went too far&quot; on their experiments. In the long run, he considered this track a mistake. Eddy compares &quot;One in their Pride&quot;, with its pared down bass, to Adrian Sherwood&#x27;s production work for Tackhead and Keith Le Blanc. &quot;Rex Irae&quot;, another rhythmic song, was described by Eddy as &quot;a dub/riff mixture&quot; that is comparable to Chain Gang, Ruts DC and A.R. Kane.

==Themes==

Celtic Frost were always fascinated with the rise and fall of ancient civilizations; their own name stands for this idea. Three songs from &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot; - &quot;Babylon Fell&quot;, &quot;Caress into Oblivion&quot; and &quot;Rex Irae&quot; - deal with the myths and history of the Babylonians, especially those of king Nebuchadnezzar II and Marduk, god-patron of the city of Babylon, capital of the Persian Empire.

&quot;I Won&#x27;t Dance (The Elder&#x27;s Orient)&quot; was inspired originally by the Egyptian &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;.

19th-century poetry was another source of inspiration for the lyrics. For example, significant portions of &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; are directly quoted from Emily Brontë poems. Martin Ain discovered these on &quot;L&#x27;Homme devant la mort&quot; () by French historian Philippe Ariès. On the other hand, the lyrics to &quot;Tristesses de la lune&quot; are borrowed from the poem of the same name in Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot;. The lyrics to &quot;Sorrows of the Moon&quot; are an English translation of the same. Moonspell vocalist Fernando Ribeiro discovered Baudelaire through this song.

==Album art==
The cover image is a detail from the right (&quot;Hell&quot;) panel of &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, a triptych painted in 1504 by Hieronymus Bosch, part of Madrid&#x27;s Prado permanent collection. The original idea of using this painting for &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;&#x27;s cover came through Martin Ain. The LP&#x27;s inner sleeve was the Les Edwards &quot;Tombworld&quot; (1980) painting. As to how band&#x27;s music can be linked their album art, Tom Warrior explained:

==Touring and promotion==

In Warrior&#x27;s recollection, three quarters into production Celtic Forst were forced, by Noise, to do some dates with Anthrax. If they didn&#x27;t, the label would cut short the funding for &quot;Pandemonium&quot;. In his defense, label boss Karl-Ulrich Walterbach stated that he simply offered the tour and never pushed it. He knew the timing wasn&#x27;t ideal for the band. One of these dates was the 1987 edition of the Aardschokdag, a Dutch annual heavy metal festival. Frost played alongside Anthrax, Metal Church, Crimson Glory, Laaz Rockit and headliners Metallica on February 8.

After the album&#x27;s release, American guitarist Ron Marks was invited to join the band, in part to bolster its live sound.

Celtic Frost did a brief English tour on late October, with Kreator and Virus. They then flew to the United States, to be the opening act to the December leg of Anthrax&#x27;s &quot;Among the Living&quot; tour. Frost caught the thrash explosion in the US. In a few months, Anthrax went from playing to 500 people per show to 7,000 or 8,000 every night, without radio play or MTV exposure.

After &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;, Celtic Frost became one of Noise&#x27;s bestsellers. By the end of the year, the band&#x27;s third album had sold 100,000 records worldwide. Alongside the 250,000 sold by Running Wild&#x27;s &quot;Under Jolly Roger&quot; and the 500,000 sold of Helloween&#x27;s &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I&quot;, 1987 helped usher a new era for the German label. There were a number of factors that aided this turn of events: SPV&#x27;s European distribution network, RCA&#x27;s promotional push behind Helloween and an enthusiastic metal press.

Thomas Gabriel Fischer finally performed Celtic Frost&#x27;s requiem at Roadburn 2019 with Triptykon, along with the Metropole Orkest. &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Rex Irae&quot; is the opening part; the third, concluding part - &quot;Winter (Requiem, Chapter Three: Finale)&quot; - can be heard on 2006&#x27;s &quot;Monotheist&quot;. The second, long missing second part (&quot;Grave Eternal&quot;) was never officially released until these performances. A full, live rendition of the entire piece has been released.

==Legacy==

Malcolm Dome called &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot; both &quot;metal&#x27;s most visionary album&quot; and an &quot;avant garde metal masterpiece&quot;. Tom Warrior himself said that it is &quot;the band’s most important release.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia considered &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot; &quot;one of the classic extreme metal albums of all time.&quot; In 1991, Eddy ranked &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot; at number 108 in his list of the 500 best heavy metal albums ever.

&quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot; had a decisive impact on the emerging gothic metal scene of the 1990s. Paradise Lost collectively held the album in high esteem. &quot;It made [us] what we are&quot;, said Mackintosh, &quot;and so many other bands [...] too.&quot; Rhythm guitarist Aaron Aedy pointed out that &quot;Pandemonium&quot;&#x27;s use of orchestration inspired their sophomore album, &quot;Gothic&quot;. My Dying Bride&#x27;s Andrew Craighan revealed that adventurous use of violins on &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot; encouraged MDB to do the same. Craighan felt something like &quot;we can do that if they’re doing it&quot;. Moonspell&#x27;s Ribeiro found &quot;Pandemonium&quot; &quot;groundbreaking and inspiring&quot;. He preferred Celtic Frost&#x27;s unorthodox approach to heavy metal &quot;than to be bound to an unwritten book of Underground laws to please others instead of our artistic hunger.&quot; This particular record made them deepen the connection with their Middle Eastern and African musical heritage, a big part of the folk music from their native Portugal.

Warrior&#x27;s &quot;goth&quot; crooning on &quot;Pandemonium&quot; also prove influential to gothic metal pioneers. Paradise Lost singer Nick Holmes said &quot;Mesmerized&quot; was his second favorite Celtic Frost song, partly because of how Warrior sang on it. Anathema&#x27;s Vincent Cavanagh, later on, would borrow Warrior&#x27;s moaned-style singing on &quot;Mesmerized&quot; for &quot;The Silent Enigma&quot;&#x27;s title track.

Celtic Frost&#x27;s third album also had a lasting influence on symphonic metal. Therion mainman Christofer Johnsson, in particular, frequently acknowledges its importance. In 2021, it was elected by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; as the second best symphonic metal album of all time.

<doc id="195776" wikidata="Q2601720" url="?curid=195776" title="Super Fly (1972 film)">
<text>Super Fly is a 1972 American blaxploitation crime drama film directed by Gordon Parks Jr. and starring Ron O&#x27;Neal as Youngblood Priest, an African American cocaine dealer who is trying to quit the underworld drug business. The film is well known for its soundtrack, written and produced by soul musician Curtis Mayfield. It was released on August 4, 1972.

O&#x27;Neal reprised his role as Youngblood Priest in the 1973 film &quot;Super Fly T.N.T.&quot;, which he also directed. Producer Sig Shore directed a second sequel, &quot;The Return of Superfly&quot;, released in 1990, with Nathan Purdee as Priest. A remake was released in 2018.

In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Youngblood Priest (Ron O&#x27;Neal), an African-American cocaine dealer, enjoys a luxurious lifestyle in Harlem. He yearns to go straight, despite the fortune he makes. One day, Priest confronts Fat Freddie, one of his dealers, about money that Freddie owes and threatens to force Freddie&#x27;s wife into prostitution unless he robs a competitor. Although the timid Freddie abhors violence, he agrees and accompanies another member of Priest&#x27;s &quot;family&quot; of lower-level dealers to commit the robbery.

Priest discusses his plan to buy thirty kilos of high-quality cocaine with the $300,000 he and his partner Eddie have, which they can sell for $1,000,000 within four months. With such a big score, they can retire comfortably. Eddie argues that crime is the only option left to them by &quot;The Man&quot;. That night, Eddie and Priest approach Scatter, a retired dealer who started Priest in the business. Scatter initially refuses to help Priest. Eddie threatens Scatter, demanding that he reveal his source if he will not supply them, but Scatter holds him at gunpoint. Priest defuses the situation and persuades Scatter to help them, although Scatter warns that it will be the last time.

Priest and Eddie are joined by Freddie, who turns over the money he stole. The next day, Freddie is picked up for fighting, and when he is beaten by the police, he reveals when and where Priest and Eddie are to pick up the first kilo of cocaine from Scatter. Freddie attempts to escape and is killed when he runs in front of a car.

That night, after picking up the kilo from Scatter, Priest and Eddie are apprehended by several policemen. The lieutenant reveals that he is Scatter&#x27;s supplier and that they can have as much &quot;weight,&quot; as they want, and will be extended both credit and protection. Eddie is elated by the new situation, claiming that they are set for life, although Priest is still determined to quit after selling the thirty kilos. Soon after, the drugs are sold by Priest and Eddie&#x27;s &quot;family.&quot;

Priest&#x27;s white mistress, Cynthia, is dismayed to learn that Priest does not return her love and is planning on quitting the business. Their argument is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Scatter who reveals that the real head of the operation is Deputy Commissioner Reardon, who is trying to kill him for quitting. Scatter gives Priest a packet of information on Reardon and his family. Scatter is captured by the corrupt policemen, who give him a fatal overdose of drugs.

Both enraged and scared, Priest gives the information on Reardon and an envelope of cash to two mafia men and takes out a $100,000 contract on &quot;the Man&#x27;s&quot; life. Priest demands his half of their profits from Eddie. After Priest leaves with the cash, Eddie betrays him by phoning the lieutenant. Priest has anticipated Eddie&#x27;s duplicity, however, and gives the briefcase carrying the money to a disguised Georgia in exchange for one full of rags. Priest is then picked up by the lieutenant and taken to the waterfront, where he is confronted by Reardon.

Reardon threatens Priest that he must continue selling drugs as long as he is ordered to, but when Priest refuses, the policemen begin to beat him. Priest overcomes his foes using karate, then reveals that he knows exactly who Reardon is. Priest explains that he hired contract killers to murder Reardon and his entire family should anything happen to him. The powerless Reardon then watches as Priest walks away free, giving the policemen one final glare before driving off to join Georgia.

== Production ==
Filming took place from January to mid-April 1972 in New York City. The film was financed by two directors: Gordon Parks, who had directed the 1971 film &quot;Shaft&quot;, and Sig Shore, who produced &quot;Super Fly&quot; and played Deputy Commissioner Riordan, or &quot;The Man&quot; in the film. Large companies produced many of the blaxploitation films, and &quot;Super Fly&quot; is no exception. The film was acquired and distributed by Warner Bros. and had a white producer (Shore). African-Americans were a part of the process as well, with Gordon Parks Jr. as director and Phillip Fenty as screenwriter.

Nate Adams coordinated the fashion and wardrobe for the film. He had done several fashion shows prior to &quot;Super Fly&quot;. He still owns many of the suits, shoes and fedora hats.

Charles McGregor, who plays Fat Freddie, was released from prison before the film&#x27;s production. The film was shot by director of photography James Signorelli, who later became the film segment director for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Carl Lee, who played Eddie, enjoyed television fame until he abused drugs – in particular, heroin. He died in 1986 of an overdose. The film&#x27;s soundtrack by Curtis Mayfield was well enough received that he was sought for other soundtracks. The songs &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot; and the title song both shot up the Pop Top Ten chart in late 1972, with each single selling over a million copies.

The movie generated roughly $4 million in profits. Shore received the bulk of the profits since he put up the most money, 40 percent, while the actors, directors, and scriptwriters split the remaining profits. The soundtrack alone generated about $5 million in profits – one of the first film soundtracks to earn such a sizable return – primarily from the biggest singles &quot;Super Fly&quot; and &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot;. As the soundtrack&#x27;s composer, Mayfield was the only other person in the production who earned revenue approaching Shore&#x27;s.

Despite the controversy surrounding &quot;Super Fly&quot;″s drug use, the production of the film made significant advances for African-Americans. The Harlem community backed &quot;Super Fly&quot; financially, and a number of black businesses helped with the production costs. Another quality that distinguishes &quot;Super Fly&quot; from other blaxploitation films was the technical crew, the majority of which was non-white, constituting the largest non-white technical crew in its time. Altogether, such an independently financed film ultimately had unusually large financial backing.

==Reception==
===Critical reception and box-office===
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of 28 professional film critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.3/10. On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 67 out of 100 based on eight reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

After an initial gross of $24.8 million, the film was re-released in 1973 and earned $2 million in US and Canada rentals. It was the highest-grossing blaxploitation film at the time.

===Social analysis===
At the time &quot;Super Fly&quot; was released, there were many African-Americans displeased with the images of black culture portrayed in films such as &quot;Super Fly&quot;, &quot;Sweet Sweetback’s Baadassssss Song&quot;, and &quot;Shaft&quot;. Junius Griffin, the head of the Hollywood branch of the NAACP stated, &quot;we must insist that our children are not exposed to a steady diet of so-called black movies that glorify black males as pimps, dope pushers, gangsters, and super males.&quot; The Congress for Racial Equality, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other organizations attempted to block the film&#x27;s distribution, and pushed for more African-American involvement in Hollywood&#x27;s creative process. The Student National Coordinating Committee protested the film as a tool of white oppression. The filmmakers maintained it was their desire to show the negative and empty aspects of the drug subculture. This is evident in the movie from the beginning, as Priest communicates his desire to leave the business. However, nearly every character in the film, with the notable exception of his &quot;,&quot; tries to dissuade Priest from quitting, with their chief argument being that dealing and drug use are the best he ever could achieve in life.

&quot;Super Fly&quot; resonated with many of the post-Civil Rights Movement generation of African Americans, who saw Youngblood as a new example of how to rise in the American class system. Several California organized crime veterans, including drug trafficker &quot;Freeway&quot; Rick Ross, have cited the film as an influence upon their personal decision to take up drug dealing and gang violence.

Film scholar Manthiahas Diawara suggested the film&#x27;s glorification of drug dealers served to subtly critique the civil rights movement&#x27;s failure to provide better economic opportunities for black America, and that the portrayal of a black community controlled by drug dealers serves to highlight that the initiatives of the civil rights movement were far from fully accomplished.

==DVD release==
A standard definition DVD was released by Warner Brothers on January 14, 2004—the day its star, Ron O&#x27;Neal, died after battling cancer. The original blue and orange Warner logo is replaced by the updated AOL/Warner logo used at the time of DVD release. The end credits on the original film release and video cassette differ from the DVD. On the original release and videocassette, the film end credits roll with a shot of the top of the Empire State Building and the title track (&quot;Superfly&quot;) plays.

After &quot;The End&quot; is displayed, the film fades to black, but Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Superfly&quot; continues to play for a few minutes until the track ends. In the DVD release, Warner Bros. decided to fade out the track midway right as &quot;The End&quot; is shown, and again brings up the AOL/Warner logo.

In June 2018, The Warner Archive Collection released &quot;Super Fly&quot; on Blu-ray, and has received mostly praise for its video &amp; audio restoration.

==Remake==

&quot;Superfly&quot; was remade by Director X and released in June 2018 with a cast that included Trevor Jackson and Jason Mitchell.

<doc id="195777" wikidata="Q2101438" url="?curid=195777" title="Political action committee">
<text>In the United States, a political action committee (PAC) is a tax-exempt 527 organization that pools campaign contributions from members and donates those funds to campaigns for or against candidates, ballot initiatives, or legislation. The legal term PAC was created in pursuit of campaign finance reform in the United States. Democracies of other countries use different terms for the units of campaign spending or spending on political competition (see political finance). At the U.S. federal level, an organization becomes a PAC when it receives or spends more than $1,000 for the purpose of influencing a federal election, and registers with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), according to the Federal Election Campaign Act as amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (also known as the McCain–Feingold Act). At the state level, an organization becomes a PAC according to the state&#x27;s election laws.

Contributions to PACs from corporate or labor union treasuries are illegal, though these entities may sponsor a PAC and provide financial support for its administration and fundraising. Union-affiliated PACs may solicit contributions only from union members. Independent PACs may solicit contributions from the general public and must pay their own costs from those funds.

==Overview==
Federal multi-candidate PACs may contribute to candidates as follows:
* $5,000 to a candidate or candidate committee for each election (primary and general elections count as separate elections);
* $15,000 to a political party per year; and
* $5,000 to another PAC per year.
* PACs may make unlimited expenditures independently of a candidate or political party

In its 2010 case &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned sections of the Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (also known as the McCain–Feingold Act) that had prohibited corporate and union political independent expenditures in political campaigns. &quot;Citizens United&quot; declared it was unconstitutional to prohibit corporations and unions from spending from their general treasuries to promote candidates or from contributing to PACs. It left intact these laws&#x27; prohibitions on corporations or unions contributing directly to a candidate or candidate committee.

==History==

The political action committee emerged from the labor movement of 1943. The first PAC was the CIO-PAC, formed in July 1943 under CIO president Philip Murray and headed by Sidney Hillman. It was established after the U.S. Congress prohibited unions from giving direct contributions to political candidates. This restriction was initially imposed in 1907 on corporations through the Tillman Act. The Smith–Connally Act extended its coverage to labor unions in 1943. A series of campaign reform laws enacted during the 1970s facilitated the growth of PACs after these laws allowed corporations, trade associations, and labor unions to form PACs. In 1971 the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) created rules for disclosure, which made it so all donations received by PACs must go through a central committee maintained by said PAC. Furthermore, it required PACs to file regular reports with the Federal Election Commission(FEC) disclosing anyone who has donated at least $200. The Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional limits imposed on PACs by the legislature under First Amendment grounds in many cases, starting with Buckley v. Valeo.

Throughout the past 30 years, campaign donations from PACs have been increasingly growing, with $333 million being raised in 1990 to $482 million in 2022. Even with the major growth, PAC contributions only made up 23% of the money raised by House candidates and only 10% for senate candidates, despite media coverage which tends to exaggerate contributions.

==Categorization==

Federal law formally allows for two types of PACs: connected and non-connected. Judicial decisions added a third classification, independent expenditure-only committees, which are colloquially known as &quot;super PACs&quot;.

===Connected PACs===
Most of the 4,600 active, registered PACs, named &quot;connected PACs&quot;, sometimes also called &quot;corporate PACs&quot;, are established by businesses, non-profits, labor unions, trade groups, or health organizations. These PACs receive and raise money from a &quot;restricted class&quot;, generally consisting of managers and shareholders in the case of a corporation or members in the case of a non-profit organization, labor union or other interest group. As of January 2009, there were 1,598 registered corporate PACs, 272 related to labor unions and 995 to trade organizations.

===Non-connected PACs===
Groups with an ideological mission, single-issue groups, and members of Congress and other political leaders may form &quot;non-connected PACs&quot;. These organizations may accept funds from any individual, connected PAC, or organization. As of January 2009, there were 1,594 non-connected PACs, the fastest-growing category.

====Leadership PACs====
Elected officials and political parties cannot give more than the federal limit directly to candidates. However, they can set up a leadership PAC that makes independent expenditures. Provided the expenditure is not coordinated with the other candidate, this type of spending is not limited.

Under the FEC (Federal Election Commission) rules, leadership PACs are non-connected PACs, and can accept donations from individuals and other PACs. Since current officeholders have an easier time attracting contributions, Leadership PACs are a way dominant parties can capture seats from other parties. A leadership PAC sponsored by an elected official cannot use funds to support that official&#x27;s own campaign. However, it may fund travel, administrative expenses, consultants, polling, and other non-campaign expenses.

In the 2018 election cycle, leadership PACs donated more than $67 million to federal candidates. The number remained steady during the 2024 election cycle, with leadership PACs donating nearly $69 million to federal candidates. According to the government watchdog group OpenSecrets, 764 total PACs donated about $41.5 million to Republicans and $26.5 million to Democrats.

=====Controversial use of leadership PACs=====
* Former Rep. John Doolittle&#x27;s (R-CA) leadership PAC paid 15% to a firm that employed only his wife. Payouts to his wife&#x27;s firm were $68,630 in 2003 and 2004, and $224,000 in 2005 and 2006. The Doolittle home was raided in 2007. After years of investigation, the Justice Department dropped the case with no charges in June 2010.
* One Leadership PAC purchased $2,139 in gifts from Bose Corporation.
* Former Rep. Richard Pombo (R-CA) used his leadership PAC to pay hotel bills ($22,896) and buy baseball tickets ($320) for donors.
* Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s (D-CA) leadership PAC, Team Majority, was fined $21,000 by federal election officials &quot;for improperly accepting donations over federal limits.&quot;
* President Trump&#x27;s leadership PAC Save America paid $650,000 for portraits of him and the first lady that will one day hang in the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery, $200,000 to Trump Hotel properties, and $132,000 to First Lady Melania Trump&#x27;s fashion stylist.

===Super PACs===

Super PACs, officially known as &quot;independent expenditure-only political action committees,&quot; are unlike traditional PACs in that they may raise unlimited amounts from individuals, corporations, unions, and other groups to spend on, for example, ads overtly advocating for or against political candidates. However, they are not allowed to either coordinate with or contribute directly to candidate campaigns or political parties. Super PACs are subject to the same organizational, reporting, and public disclosure requirements of traditional PACs.

===Hybrid PAC===

A hybrid PAC (sometimes called a Carey Committee) is similar to a super PAC, but can give limited amounts of money directly to campaigns and committees, while still making independent expenditures in unlimited amounts.

==Top PACs by election cycle==
OpenSecrets maintains a list of the largest PACs by election cycle on its website OpenSecrets.org. Their list can be filtered by receipts or different types of expenses, political party, and type of PAC.

<doc id="195780" wikidata="Q846365" url="?curid=195780" title="St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin">
<text>Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral () in Dublin, Ireland, founded in 1191 as a Roman Catholic cathedral, is currently the national cathedral of the Church of Ireland. Christ Church Cathedral, also a Church of Ireland cathedral in Dublin, is designated as the local cathedral of the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough.

==Background==
Unusually, St Patrick&#x27;s is not the seat of a bishop, as the Archbishop of Dublin has his seat in Christ Church Cathedral. Since 1870, the Church of Ireland has designated St Patrick&#x27;s as the national cathedral for the whole of Ireland, drawing chapter members from each of the 12 dioceses of the Church of Ireland. The dean is the ordinary for the cathedral; this office has existed since 1219. The most famous office holder was Jonathan Swift.

===Status===

Some believe it was intended that St Patrick&#x27;s, a secular (diocesan clergy who are not members of a religious order, i.e. under a rule and, therefore, &quot;regular&quot;) cathedral, would replace Christ Church, a cathedral managed by an order.

A confrontational situation persisted, with considerable tension, over the decades after the establishment of St Patrick&#x27;s, and was eventually settled, more or less, by the signing of a six-point agreement of 1300, &quot;Pacis Compositio&quot;. Still extant, and in force until 1870, it provided that:
* The consecration and enthronement of the Archbishop of Dublin was to take place at Christ Church – records show that this provision was not always followed, with many archbishops enthroned in both, and at least two in Saint Patrick&#x27;s only
* Christ Church had formal precedence, as the mother and senior cathedral of the diocese
* Christ Church was to retain the cross, mitre and ring of each deceased Archbishop of Dublin
* Deceased Archbishops of Dublin were to be buried alternately in each of the two cathedrals, unless they personally willed otherwise
* The annual consecration of chrism oil for the diocese was to take place at Christ Church
* The two cathedrals were to act as one and shared equally in their freedoms.

Over the following centuries, the two cathedrals functioned together in the diocese, until in the period of disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the current designation of one as the &quot;cathedral of Dublin and Glendalough&quot;, and one as the &quot;national cathedral&quot;, was developed.

==History==

===Pre-Reformation period===
In 1192, John Comyn, first Anglo-Norman archbishop of Dublin, elevated one of the four Dublin Celtic parish churches, this one dedicated to Saint Patrick, beside a holy well of the same name and on an island between two branches of the River Poddle, to the status of a collegiate church, i.e., a church with a body of clergy devoted to both worship and learning. The new collegiate church fell outside the city boundaries, and this move created two new civic territories, one under the archbishop&#x27;s temporal jurisdiction. The church was dedicated to &quot;God, our Blessed Lady Mary and St Patrick&quot; on 17 March 1191.

Comyn&#x27;s charter of 1191 or 1192, which allowed for a chapter of thirteen canons, of which three held special dignities (as chancellor, precentor and treasurer), was confirmed by a papal bull (of Pope Celestine III) within a year. The thirteen prebendaries attached to the church were provided with archepiscopal lands.

Over time, a whole complex of buildings arose in the vicinity of the cathedral, including the Palace of the St Sepulchre (seat of the archbishop), and legal jurisdiction was divided between a Liberty controlled by the dean, around the cathedral, and a larger one belonging to the archbishop, adjacent.

While it is not clear when precisely the church was further raised to the status of a cathedral, a unique move in a city with an existing cathedral, it was probably after 1192, and Comyn&#x27;s successor as Archbishop, Henry de Loundres, was elected in 1212 by the chapters of both Christ Church and St Patrick&#x27;s, this election being recognised by Pope Innocent III. See below for more on the question of status. Henry granted a number of further charters to the cathedral and chapter between 1218 and 1220, and one of these in 1220 created the office of dean to head the cathedral, the right of an election being allocated solely to the canons of the Chapter.

The basis of the present building, as noted, the largest church in Ireland, was built between 1191 and 1270, though little now remains of the earliest work beyond the baptistry. Much of the work was overseen by the previously mentioned Henry of London, a friend of the King of England and signatory of the Magna Carta, who was also involved in the construction of Dublin&#x27;s city walls, and Dublin Castle.

An order from King Henry III in 1225 allowed the collection of donations from across the island for reconstruction for a period of four years, and the work, in the Early English Gothic style, lasted at least until rededication in 1254. The Lady Chapel was added around 1270.

In 1300, Archbishop Ferings of Dublin arranged an agreement between the two cathedrals, the &quot;Pacis Compositio&quot;, which acknowledged both as cathedrals and made some provisions to accommodate their shared status. For more, see &quot;Status&quot; below.

In 1311 the Medieval University of Dublin was founded here with William de Rodyard, Dean of St Patrick&#x27;s, as its first Chancellor, and the Canons as its members. It never flourished and was suppressed at the Reformation.

From the mid-14th century, and for over 500 years, the north transept of the building was used as the parish church of St Nicholas Without (i.e. the part of the Parish of St Nicholas outside the city proper).

The tower (Minot&#x27;s Tower) and west nave were rebuilt between 1362 and 1370, following a fire. The name commemorates Thomas Minot, Archbishop of Dublin 1363–75, who oversaw the rebuilding.

From the very earliest years, there were problems with seepage of water, with a number of floods, especially in the later years of the 18th century, caused by the surrounding branches of the River Poddle – even in the 20th century, it is reported that the water table was within 2.3 metres (7.5 feet) of the floor. This situation ensured there would never be a crypt or basement area.

===Reformation period===

After the English Reformation (an uneven process between 1536 and 1564 but at St Patrick&#x27;s effective from about 1537), St Patrick&#x27;s became an Anglican (Church of Ireland) church. In the 1530s some images within the cathedral were defaced by soldiers under Thomas Cromwell, and neglect led to the collapse of the nave in 1544. The conventionally flexible style of the Archbishop of Dublin Hugh Curwen is instructive; he was a follower firstly of Henry&#x27;s non-reformed church in the 1530s, then of Edward VI&#x27;s full-blown Protestantism c. 1550, then accepting his appointment as archbishop during Queen Mary&#x27;s reversion of the church to Roman Catholicism in 1555, and continued to serve as the archbishop, using the Anglican rite from 1559, under Queen Elizabeth until 1567.

Under King Edward VI, St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was formally suppressed and the building was demoted back to the status of a parish church. On 25 April 1547, a pension of 200 marks sterling was assigned to &quot;Sir Edward Basnet&quot;, the dean, followed, some months later, by pensions of £60 each to Chancellor Alien and Precentor Humphrey, and £40 to Archdeacon Power. The silver, jewels, and ornaments were transferred to the dean and chapter of Christ Church. The King designated part of the building for use as a courthouse, the cathedral grammar school was established in the then vicar&#x27;s hall and the deanery was given to the archbishop, following the transfer of the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace to the Lord Deputy of Ireland. In 1549, it was further ordered that the walls be repainted and inscribed with passages from the scriptures.

In 1555 a charter of the joint monarchs Philip and Mary restored the cathedral&#x27;s privileges and initiated restoration and a late document of Queen Mary&#x27;s reign, a deed dated 27 April 1558, comprises a release or receipt by Thomas Leverous, the new dean, and the chapter of St Patrick&#x27;s, of the &quot;goods, chattels, musical instruments, etc.&quot;, belonging to the cathedral, and which had been in the possession of the dean and chapter of Christ Church. It was during this reign that the patronal festival of the Blessed Virgin Mary was last celebrated (in 1558).

Following the ejection of the Catholic chapter of canons in 1559, the Catholic community continued in the 1560s–1570s at least to go on nominating canons and the principal dignitaries to St Patrick&#x27;s.

In 1560, one of Dublin&#x27;s first public clocks was erected in &quot;St Patrick&#x27;s Steeple&quot;.

===17th century===

By the early 17th century, the Lady Chapel was said to have been in ruins, and the arch at the east end of the choir was closed off by a lath and plaster partition wall. There was also routine flooding and a series of galleries was added to accommodate large congregations. In 1620 the English-born judge Luke Gernon referred to the cathedral&#x27;s poor state of repair.

During the stay of Oliver Cromwell in Dublin, during his conquest of Ireland the Commonwealth&#x27;s Lord Protector stabled his horses in the nave of the cathedral. This was intended to demonstrate Cromwell&#x27;s disrespect for the Anglican religion, which he associated with Roman Catholicism and political Royalism.

After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, repairs to the building were begun.

In 1666, the cathedral chapter offered the Lady Chapel for the use of French-speaking Huguenots who had fled to Ireland, and after some repair and preparation works, it became known as &quot;L&#x27;Eglise Française de St Patrick&quot;. A lease was signed on 23 December 1665 and was renewed from time to time until the special services ceased in 1816, by which time the Huguenots had been fully assimilated into the city population.

In 1668 the roof, in danger of collapsing, was taken down, and a new roof was completed by 1671. Buttresses were erected and the west window was replaced with a perpendicular window. Then, in the 1680s, the choir was reformed. In 1688–90, during the Williamite War in Ireland, James II and his fellow Catholics briefly repossessed St Patrick&#x27;s. However, the victory of the Protestant Williamites in this war meant that the cathedral was restored to Anglican ownership in 1690 when James abandoned Dublin after his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne.

===18th century===

Throughout its long history, the cathedral has contributed much to Irish life, and one key aspect of this relates to the writer and satirist Jonathan Swift, author of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, who was dean of the cathedral from 1713 to 1745. Many of his famous sermons and &quot;Irish tracts&quot; (such as the &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot;) were given during his stay as Dean.

His grave and epitaph can be seen in the cathedral, along with those of his friend Stella. Swift took a great interest in the building, its services and music and in what would now be called social welfare, funding an almshouse for poor women and Saint Patrick&#x27;s Hospital.

The Choir School, which had been founded in 1432, supplied many of its members to take part in the very first performance of Handel&#x27;s Messiah in 1742.

In 1749, the cathedral spire was added by George Semple; it remains one of Dublin&#x27;s landmarks.

In 1792, divine service was temporarily suspended due to the poor condition of the south wall, then 60 centimetres (2 feet) out of perpendicular, and of parts of the roof.

====Chivalric chapels====
* Knights of St Patrick. From 1783 until 1871 the cathedral served as the Chapel of the Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick, members of which were the Knights of St Patrick. With the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, the installation ceremony moved to St Patrick&#x27;s Hall, Dublin Castle. The heraldic banners of the knights at the time of the change still hang over the choir stalls to this day.
* &quot;Paris-Malta obedience&quot; of the Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910). The cathedral contains the so-called &quot;Dunsany&quot; Chapel which is the spiritual home of the order in Ireland. The decoration of the chapel was provided for by Randall Plunkett, 19th Lord Dunsany, who established the order in Ireland in 1962. The cathedral is used for its investiture ceremonies and the dean of the cathedral is an Ecclesiastical Commander of the order.

===19th century===
By 1805, the north transept was in ruins and the south transept was in a poor condition; urgent work was carried out to the nave roof, held up by scaffolding.

In 1846, the post of Dean of Saint Patrick&#x27;s was united with that of Dean of Christ Church, a situation which lasted in law until 1872.

An attempt at major restoration began under the direction of Dean Pakenham (Dean, 1843–1864), limited by poor economic circumstances. The Lady Chapel was restored, the floor (then raised several metres) reduced to its original level and other urgent matters were at least partly addressed.

In the mid-19th century, a Celtic cross was found buried near the cathedral. This has been preserved and it is thought it may have marked the site of the former holy well.

The major reconstruction, paid for by Benjamin Guinness, in 1860–65, and inspired by the fear that the cathedral was in imminent danger of collapse, means that much of the current building and decoration dates from the Victorian era; medieval chantries were removed among other actions, and few records of the work survive today.

Though the rebuilding ensured the survival of the cathedral, the failure to preserve records of the scale of the rebuild means that little is known as to how much of the current building is genuinely mediæval and how much is Victorian pastiche. Sir Benjamin&#x27;s statue by JH Foley is outside the south door. His son Arthur (also a brewer) came in for humorous but gentle criticism when he donated a stained glass window of &#x27;Rebecca at the well&#x27;; its motto read: &#x27;I was thirsty and ye gave me drink&#x27;. In 1901 his son Edward created the adjacent &quot;St Patrick&#x27;s Park&quot; from an area of decrepit housing, and donated a new set of bells to the cathedral.

The other great change for the cathedral occurred in 1871 when, following the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the newly independent church at its general synod finally resolved the &quot;two cathedrals&quot; issue, making Christ Church the sole and undisputed cathedral of the Dublin diocese and St Patrick&#x27;s the national cathedral.

==Present==
The cathedral plays host to a number of public national ceremonies. Ireland&#x27;s Remembrance Day ceremonies, hosted by the Royal British Legion and attended by the President of Ireland, take place there every November. Its carol service (the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols), celebrated twice in December, including every 24 December, is a colourful feature of Dublin life.

On Saturdays in autumn, the cathedral hosts the graduation ceremonies of Technological University Dublin.

The funerals of two Irish presidents, Douglas Hyde and Erskine Childers, took place there in 1949 and 1974 respectively. At President Hyde&#x27;s funeral, the whole of the Irish government and opposition contingent, but for Childers and Noel Browne, stayed in the foyer of the church. This was because, at the time of the funeral, the Holy See forbade Roman Catholics from entering the churches of other Christian traditions. Because President Childers died in office, his state funeral was a major state occasion. The attendance included foreign dignitaries King Baudouin of Belgium, Vice-President of the United States Spiro T. Agnew (representing President Richard Nixon), Earl Mountbatten of Burma (representing Queen Elizabeth II), British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and former British prime minister Edward Heath.

In 2006, the cathedral&#x27;s national prominence was used by a group of 18 Afghan migrants seeking asylum, who occupied it for several days before being persuaded to leave without trouble.

==Governance==

===Dean and chapter===

The cathedral is headed by the dean and governed by the entire chapter, originally 13 in number and having been as many as 30, now numbering up to 28, whose foundation and members&#x27; rights derive from the charter of 1191 as approved by Pope Celestine in 1192.

According to the Constitution of the Church of Ireland, the dean is the &quot;immediate ordinary of the cathedral for the purpose of directing the clergy and official and ordering the services&quot;. However, &quot;All other matters relating to the cathedral and not otherwise provided for shall be determined in chapter.&quot; The members of the chapter, which today represents in part the whole Church of Ireland, hold one of four &quot;dignities&quot; or special offices, or one of 24 prebends (22 regular, 2 ecumenical as noted below). One prebend is reserved for the Archbishop of Dublin, an unusual arrangement which is only actively used for elections of the dean.

Of the 13 original prebends, several were later reallocated, new ones created to replace them, and later, yet further prebends were designated. For many years, the chapter comprised the four dignities, the archdeacons of Dublin and Glendalough and 24 prebendaries, but the archdeacons ceased to be members based on those offices in the late 19th century.

===Cathedral group of parishes (1970 to 2012)===
As part of a reorganisation of city-based parishes (many with long histories), several were attached to each of the Dublin cathedrals. The Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral Group of Parishes which dated as a group from 1970 ceased to exist on the retirement of Dean Robert MacCarthy on 25 January 2012.

A new parish, called the Parish of St Catherine and St James with St Audoen, was created by an act of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland. This new parish is made up of each of the parishes of St Peter, St Matthias and St Audoen; St Catherine and St James; and St Luke and St Kevin. The rector is the Revd Canon M. D. Gardner, Prebendary of Maynooth.

===Current offices===
* Dean: from 1220 to 2007, the dean held the prebend of Clondalkin (a prebend since 1191), and churches at Kilberry, Clonwanwyr (Cloney) and Clonardmacgory (Tullaghgory), all later in the Parish of Kilberry. In 1228, the Church of Tallaght was attached to the Deanery. The current dean is the Very Revd William Morton, one time Dean of St Columb&#x27;s Cathedral, Derry.
* Precentor: the precentor was given the prebend of a portion of Lusk in 1191, and in 1218 the churches of St Andrew in Dublin and Ardree. After several changes, a portion of Lusk was left. The current precentor is the Revd Peter Campion.
* Chancellor: from 1218 to 2007, the chancellor held the prebend of Finglas (from the 1191 charter) and the churches of St Martin&#x27;s (Dublin) and Killachegar, though the latter ceased by 1280. By 1280, St Martin&#x27;s also no longer provided revenue but St Werburgh&#x27;s replaced it. The current chancellor is the Very Revd Niall Sloane.
* Treasurer: this office originally held the church of Clonkene and the prebend of St Audoen&#x27;s (Dublin), as well as the rectory of St Mary&#x27;s near Dublin Castle. Ballymore-Eustace later replaced Clonkene, and part of Lusk, St Audoen&#x27;s. The current treasurer is A.H.N. McKinley.
* Taney: this prebend, relating to an ancient rural diocese, originated with the 1191 charter, was given to the Archdeacon of Dublin about 1275 and became independent in 1883 when the office of Archdeacon of Dublin ceased to hold a place in the chapter. The current Prebendary of Taney is the Venerable R. W. Carney, Archdeacon of Killaloe and Clonfert.
* Newcastle, County Dublin: this is a prebend since at least 1227 and was held by the Archdeacon of Glendalough from 1467 to 1872, when that archdeacon ceased to be a member of the chapter. The current Prebendary of Newcastle is the Revd I. M. Ellis, Rector of Newcastle (Dromore).
* Kilmactalway: this was made a prebend circa 1366 and was attached to the office of precentor for a time before becoming independent in 1467. The current Prebendary of Kilmactalway is The Revd J.C McWhirter.

* Tymothan: a manor estate, rather than a church, was attached to the Archbishopric until 1247, and has since been independent, though until Disestablishment, often vacant. As of September 2014, the Prebendary of Tymothan is Canon Paul Willoughby, Rector of the Kilmocomoge Union of Parishes (Cork).
* Mulhuddart: Mulhuddart has a history intertwined with the prebend of Castleknock, the two having been designated from at least 1230. The Venerable C.W.L. McCauley, Archdeacon of Kilmore, is Prebendary of Mulhuddart.

* Howth: Howth was one of the founding prebends, and at any early stage, the Archbishops removed the prebendal church from Ireland&#x27;s Eye to Howth village. The Prebendary of Howth as of January 2018 is Revd. Canon David Crooks.
* Rathmichael: this has been a prebend since 1227 at the latest. At July 2013, Prebendary of Rathmichael is the Revd C. W. Mullen, dean&#x27;s vicar.
* Monmohenock: originally part of the &quot;Economy Estate&quot; which supported cathedral operations, this became a lay-appointed prebend but was a regular prebend by circa 1227. The Prebendary of Monmohenock is the Revd T. C. Kinehan, Rector of Helen&#x27;s Bay (Down).
* Tipperkevin: Tipperkevin actually comprised two prebendaries from the early 14th century to circa 1600, lying in the remote parts of County Dublin later separate from the main county, between Kildare and Wicklow. As at September 2011, the Prebendary of Tipperkevin is the Revd R. Warren, Rector of Taney Parish (Dublin).
* Donaghmore: this was a prebend from at least 1267. The Prebendary of Donaghmore as at September 2011 is The Revd I.W. Ellis.
* Stagonil: named as a prebend in the Papal Bull of Celestine III, this does not seem to have functioned independently until 1303. The Prebendary of Stagonil as at December 2015 is the Revd P.A. Harvey, Rector of Abbeyleix (Leighlin).
* Cualaun: after the impedance of the Prebend of Tymothan, and following a gap, from 1317, this prebend without a church provided a seat for the Archbishop of Dublin at the Chapter, used only at the election of a dean. The Prebendary of Cualan as at September 2011 is the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Revd M. G. St A. Jackson.
* Clondalkin: transferred from the dean in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by the Rev. Brian McKay, O.Carm., Prior of Terenure College, and formerly held by the Revd Heather Morris, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland
* Finglas: transferred from the chancellor in 2007, as one of two newly authorised posts of ecumenical canon, this is now held by The Revd C. McMullen.
All above roles as at July 2020.

===Ecumenical canons===
As noted above, in late June and early July 2007, Saint Patrick&#x27;s appointed two ecumenical canons, one Presbyterian and one Roman Catholic, who can be invited by the dean to say Morning or Evening Prayer in the cathedral, read holy scripture and assist at baptisms, marriages, funerals or celebration of Holy Communion as well as participating in the meetings and decisions of the chapter.
* Roman Catholic: Rev. Prof. Enda McDonagh (2007–2012), Rev. Dr. Kieran O&#x27;Mahony OSA (2012–2017), Rev. Brian Mckay O.Carm. (2017–)
* Presbyterian: Rev. Dr. Ken Newell (2007–2012), Rev. Dr. Heather Morris (2012–2017)

==Notable features==

The cathedral, which generally receives no State funding, welcomes all, with a chapel for those who come simply to pray and a small fee for those who wish to sight-see. The cathedral website mentioned in 2006 that visitor numbers had reached around 300,000 a year.

Legend has it that Saint Patrick&#x27;s was the place where the expression &quot;chancing your arm&quot; (meaning to take a risk) originated, when The 8th Earl of Kildare cut a hole in a door there, still to be seen, and thrust his arm through it to shake hands in friendship, in an effort to call a truce in the Butler–FitzGerald dispute with James, Earl of Ormond, in 1492.

It was outside St Patrick&#x27;s that the troops of the Jacob&#x27;s Garrison assembled after the Easter Rising to march to Richmond Barracks, where their leader Thomas MacDonagh and his sub-officers John MacBride and Michael O&#x27;Hanrahan were condemned to death and moved to Kilmainham Gaol to be shot.

===Burials===
Over 500 people are buried on the site, both under the cathedral&#x27;s floor and in the graveyard outside. 
Some notable individuals include:

*Richard Northalis, Catholic Archbishop of Dublin
*John de Sandford, Catholic Archbishop of Dublin and his brother Fulk Basset

*John Cradock, Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin (1772–1778)
* Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg (1615/6–1690)
*Jonathan Swift, author and dean of the cathedral and Esther Johnson (&quot;Stella&quot;) his companion of many years.
*James Henthorn Todd (1805–1869), historian, treasurer, precentor.

===Choir school and grammar school===
The choir school continues and although originally all-male, now also admits girls; a Cathedral Girls&#x27; Choir was founded in 2000 and sings once or twice a week. The girls are mostly drawn from either the choir school or St Patrick&#x27;s Grammar School, which provides secondary education. It is no longer compulsory for grammar school pupils to be in the choirs, although many of the girls are, and a few boys; many of the boys leave when their voice breaks. Choirboys are considered professional singers and are paid monthly for their services. The girls are not. The choir also sings very occasionally at weddings and receives payment for this. Until 1998 they received a large discount on their education; they are still offered free music lessons. While non-choirboy students had two months&#x27; holidays during the summer, half of the boys were on duty every day during the summer and had to attend choir practice and two services each weekday, one service on Saturday and two on Sunday. This arrangement was also changed in 1998.

===Organ===
The organ of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral is one of the largest in Ireland with over 4,000 pipes. Parts of it date from a Renatus Harris instrument of 1695. The organ was rebuilt in the 1890s by Henry Willis and Son, in consultation with Sir George Martin. It was restored in 1963 by J. W. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd.

=== Bells ===
St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral holds the heaviest change-ringing peal of bells in Ireland, which are also the tenth heaviest in the world. They consist of a 12-bell diatonic peal (tenor: )and 3 semitone bells, with the main peal being tuned to the key of C.

In 1670 there was a ring of eight bells made by Thomas Purdue. During the Guinness restoration, a new peal of bells was presented by Benjamin Lee Guinness. In the 1890s his son, Edward Guinness, donated a new peal of bells (a peal of 10 plus a flat 4th) cast by John Taylor and Co in 1897. They were augmented with two trebles presented by Richard Cherry, the Attorney-General for Ireland (himself a prolific bellringer) in 1909, to produce Ireland&#x27;s first ring of twelve bells. The first peal rung on the bells, in 1911, was the first tower bell peal ever rung outside of England. A sharp-second bell was added in 2007 in order to create a light peal of eight, and this was also cast by John Taylor &amp; Co.

The bells are rung regularly on Sundays for Sung Eucharist and Choral Evensong, and ringing practices are held on Tuesday nights. A learners practice is also held on Saturday mornings.

An Ellacombe apparatus is installed in the ringing room, however, this is no longer functional.

===Friends of the cathedral===
The cathedral is supported by a volunteer organisation, with both subscribing (annual and five-year) and life members, who perform various tasks and contribute materially to the work and fabric of the cathedral. In addition, there is a range of voluntary groups performing specific tasks, such as bell-ringing, welcoming of guests and cleaning.

<text>The Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) is a black and white passerine bird native to Australia and southern New Guinea, and introduced to New Zealand, and the Fijian island of Taveuni. Although once considered to be three separate species, it is now considered to be one, with nine recognised subspecies. A member of the Artamidae, the Australian magpie is placed in its own genus &quot;Gymnorhina&quot; and is most closely related to the black butcherbird (&quot;Melloria quoyi&quot;). It is not closely related to the Eurasian magpie, which is a corvid.

The adult Australian magpie is a fairly robust bird ranging from in length, with black and white plumage, gold brown eyes and a solid wedge-shaped bluish-white and black bill. The male and female are similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by differences in back markings. The male has pure white feathers on the back of the head where the female has white blending to grey feathers. With its long legs, the Australian magpie walks rather than waddles or hops and spends much time on the ground.

Described as one of Australia&#x27;s most accomplished songbirds, the Australian magpie has an array of complex vocalisations. It is omnivorous, with the bulk of its varied diet made up of invertebrates. It is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range. Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and is a familiar bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and New Guinea. This species is commonly fed by households around Australia, but in spring (and occasionally in autumn) a small minority of breeding magpies (almost always males) become aggressive, swooping and attacking those who approach their nests. Research has shown that magpies can recognise at least 100 different people, and may be less likely to swoop individuals they have befriended.

Over 1,000 Australian magpies were introduced into New Zealand from 1864 to 1874, but were subsequently deemed to be displacing native birds and are now treated as a pest species. Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Fiji, where the birds are not considered an invasive species. The Australian magpie is the mascot of several Australian and New Zealand sporting teams, including the Collingwood Magpies, the Western Suburbs Magpies, Port Adelaide Magpies and, in New Zealand, the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Magpies.

==Taxonomy and nomenclature==
The Australian magpie was first described in the scientific literature by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as &quot;Coracias tibicen&quot;, the type collected in the Port Jackson region. Its specific epithet derived from the Latin &quot;tibicen&quot; &quot;flute-player&quot; or &quot;piper&quot; in reference to the bird&#x27;s melodious call. An early recorded vernacular name is &quot;piping poller&quot;, written on a painting by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter, some time between 1788 and 1792. Other names used include &quot;piping crow-shrike&quot;, &quot;piping shrike&quot;, &quot;piper&quot;, &quot;maggie&quot;, &quot;flute-bird&quot; and &quot;organ-bird&quot;. The term &quot;bell-magpie&quot; was proposed to help distinguish it from corvid magpies but failed to gain wide acceptance.

&quot;Tarra-won-nang&quot;, or &quot;djarrawunang&quot;, &quot;wibung&quot;, and &quot;marriyang&quot; were names used by the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney Basin. &quot;Booroogong&quot; and &quot;garoogong&quot; were Wiradjuri words and Victorian terms included &quot;carrak&quot; (Jardwadjali), &quot;kuruk&quot; (Western Victorian languages), &quot;kiri&quot; (Dhauwurd Wurrung language) and &quot;kurikari&quot; (Wuluwurrung). Among the Kamilaroi, it is &quot;burrugaabu&quot;, &quot;galalu&quot;, or &quot;guluu&quot;. In Western Australia it is known as &quot;warndurla&quot; among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara, and &quot;koorlbardi&quot; amongst the south west Noongar peoples. In South Australia, where it is the State emblem, it is the &quot;kurraka&quot; (Kaurna), &quot;murru&quot; (Narungga), &quot;urrakurli&quot; (Adnyamathanha), &quot;goora&quot; (Barngarla), &quot;konlarru&quot; (Ngarrindjeri) and &quot;tuwal&quot; (Bunganditj).

The bird was named for its similarity in colouration to the Eurasian magpie; it was a common practice for early settlers to name plants and animals after European counterparts. However, the Eurasian magpie is a member of the Corvidae, while its Australian counterpart is placed in the family Artamidae (although both are members of a broad corvid lineage). The Australian magpie&#x27;s affinities with butcherbirds and currawongs were recognised early, and the three genera were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature. American ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and the butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, in the Artamidae. The Australian magpie is placed in its own monotypic genus &quot;Gymnorhina&quot;, which was introduced by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840. The name of the genus is from the Ancient Greek &quot;gumnos&quot; for &quot;naked&quot; or &quot;bare&quot; and &quot;rhis&quot;, &quot;rhinos&quot; &quot;nostrils&quot;. Some authorities such as Glen Storr in 1952 and Leslie Christidis and Walter Boles in their 2008 checklist, have placed the Australian magpie in the butcherbird genus &quot;Cracticus&quot;, arguing that its adaptation to ground-living is not enough to consider it a separate genus. A molecular genetic study published in a 2013 showed that the Australian magpie is a sister taxon to the black butcherbird (&quot;Melloria quoyi&quot;), and that the two species are in turn sister to a clade that includes the other butcherbirds in the genus &quot;Cracticus&quot;. The ancestor to the two species is thought to have split from the other butcherbirds between 8.3 and 4.2 million years ago, during the late Miocene to early Pliocene, while the two species themselves diverged sometime during the Pliocene (5.8–3.0 million years ago).

The Australian magpie was subdivided into three species in the literature for much of the twentieth century: the black-backed magpie (&quot;G. tibicen&quot;), the white-backed magpie (&quot;G. hypoleuca&quot;), and the western magpie (&quot;G. dorsalis&quot;). They were later noted to hybridise readily where their territories crossed, with hybrid grey or striped-backed magpies being quite common. They were reclassified as one species by Julian Ford in 1969, with most recent authors following suit.

===Subspecies===
There are currently thought to be nine subspecies of the Australian magpie, although there are large zones of overlap with intermediate forms between the taxa. There is a tendency for birds to become larger with increasing latitude, the southern subspecies being larger than those further north, except the Tasmanian form which is small. The original form, known as the black-backed magpie and classified as &quot;Gymnorhina tibicen&quot;, has been split into four black-backed races:

* &quot;G. tibicen tibicen&quot;, the nominate form, is a large subspecies found in southeastern Queensland, from the vicinity of Moreton Bay through eastern New South Wales to Moruya, New South Wales almost to the Victorian border. It is coastal or near-coastal and is restricted to east of the Great Dividing Range.
* &quot;G. tibicen terraereginae&quot;, found from Cape York and the Gulf Country southwards across Queensland to the coast between Halifax Bay in the north and south to the Mary River, and central and western New South Wales and into northern South Australia, is a small to medium-sized subspecies. The plumage is the same as that of subspecies &quot;tibicen&quot;, although the female has a shorter black tip to the tail. The wings and tarsus are shorter and the bill proportionally longer. It was originally described by Gregory Mathews in 1912, its subspecies name a Latin translation, &quot;terra&quot; &quot;land&quot; &quot;reginae&quot; &quot;queen&#x27;s&quot; of &quot;Queensland&quot;. Hybridisation with the large white-backed subspecies &quot;tyrannica&quot; occurs in northern Victoria and southeastern New South Wales; intermediate forms have black bands of varying sizes in white-backed area. Three-way hybridisation occurs between Bega and Batemans Bay on the New South Wales south coast.
* &quot;G. tibicen eylandtensis&quot;, the Top End magpie, is found from the Kimberley in northern Western Australia, across the Northern Territory through Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt and into the Gulf Country. It is a small subspecies with a long and thinner bill, with birds of Groote Eylandt possibly even smaller than mainland birds. It has a narrow black terminal tailband, and a narrow black band; the male has a large white nape, the female pale grey. This form was initially described by H. L. White in 1922. It intergrades with subspecies &quot;terraereginae&quot; southeast of the Gulf of Carpentaria.
* &quot;G. tibicen longirostris&quot;, the long-billed magpie, is found across northern Western Australia, from Shark Bay into the Pilbara. Named in 1903 by Alex Milligan, it is a medium-sized subspecies with a long thin bill. Milligan speculated the bill may have been adapted for the local conditions, slim fare meaning the birds had to pick at dangerous scorpions and spiders. There is a broad area of hybridisation with the western &quot;dorsalis&quot; in southern central Western Australia from Shark Bay south to the Murchison River and east to the Great Victoria Desert.

The white-backed magpie, originally described as &quot;Gymnorhina hypoleuca&quot; by John Gould in 1837, has also been split into races:
* &quot;G. tibicen tyrannica&quot;, a very large white-backed form found from Twofold Bay on the New South Wales far south coast, across southern Victoria south of the Great Dividing Range through to the Coorong in southeastern South Australia. It was first described by Schodde and Mason in 1999. It has a broad black tail band.
* &quot;G. tibicen telonocua&quot;, found from Cowell south into the Eyre and Yorke Peninsulas in southern South Australia, as well as the southwestern Gawler Ranges. Described by Schodde and Mason in 1999, its subspecific name is an anagram of &quot;leuconota&quot; &quot;white-backed&quot;. It is very similar to &quot;tyrannica&quot;, differing in having a shorter wing and being lighter and smaller overall. The bill is relatively short compared with other magpie subspecies. Intermediate forms are found in the Mount Lofty Ranges and on Kangaroo Island.
* &quot;G. tibicen hypoleuca&quot; now refers to a small white-backed subspecies with a short compact bill and short wings, found on King and Flinders Islands, as well as Tasmania.
* The western magpie, &quot;G. tibicen dorsalis&quot; was originally described as a separate species by A. J. Campbell in 1895 and is found in the fertile south-west corner of Western Australia. The adult male has a white back and most closely resembles subspecies &quot;telonocua&quot;, though it is a little larger with a longer bill and the black tip of its tail plumage is narrower. The female is unusual in that it has a scalloped black or brownish-black mantle and back; the dark feathers there are edged with white. This area appears a more uniform black as the plumage ages and the edges are worn away. Both sexes have black thighs.
* The New Guinean magpie, &quot;G. tibicen papuana&quot;, is a little-known subspecies found in southern New Guinea. The adult male has a mostly white back with a narrow black stripe, and the female a blackish back; the black feathers here are tipped with white similar to subspecies &quot;dorsalis&quot;. It has a long deep bill resembling that of subspecies &quot;longirostris&quot;. Genetically it is closely related to a western lineage of Australian magpies comprising subspecies &quot;dorsalis&quot;, &quot;longirostris&quot; and &quot;eylandtensis&quot;, suggesting their ancestors occupied in savannah country that was a land bridge between New Guinea and Australia and was submerged around 16,500 years ago.

==Description==

The adult magpie ranges from in length with a wingspan, and weighing . Its robust wedge-shaped bill is bluish-white bordered with black, with a small hook at the tip. The black legs are long and strong. The plumage is pure glossy black and white; both sexes of all subspecies have black heads, wings and underparts with white shoulders. The tail has a black terminal band. The nape is white in the male and light greyish-white in the female. Mature magpies have dull red eyes, in contrast to the yellow eyes of currawongs and white eyes of Australian ravens and crows. The main difference between the subspecies lies in the &quot;saddle&quot; markings on the back below the nape. Black-backed subspecies have a black saddle and white nape. White-backed subspecies have a wholly white nape and saddle. The male Western Australian subspecies &quot;dorsalis&quot; is also white-backed, but the equivalent area in the female is scalloped black.

Juveniles have lighter greys and browns amidst the starker blacks and whites of their plumage; two- or three-year-old birds of both sexes closely resemble and are difficult to distinguish from adult females. Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age. Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age, though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded. The reported age of first breeding has varied according to area, but the average is between three and five years.

Well-known and easily recognisable, the Australian magpie is unlikely to be confused with any other species. The pied butcherbird has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species&#x27; black underparts. The magpie-lark is a much smaller and more delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.

===Vocalisations===

One of Australia&#x27;s most highly regarded songbirds, the Australian magpie has a wide variety of calls, many of which are complex. Pitch may vary as much as four octaves, and the bird can mimic over 35 species of native and introduced bird species, as well as dogs and horses. Magpies have even been noted to mimic human speech when living in close proximity to humans. Its complex, musical, warbling call is one of the most familiar Australian bird sounds. In Denis Glover&#x27;s poem &quot;The Magpies&quot;, the mature magpie&#x27;s call is described as &quot;quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle&quot;, one of the most famous lines in New Zealand poetry, and as &quot;waddle giggle gargle paddle poodle&quot;, in the children&#x27;s book &quot;Waddle Giggle Gargle&quot; by Pamela Allen. The bird has been known to mimic environmental sounds as well, including the noises made by emergency vehicles during the 2019-20 &quot;Black Summer&quot; bushfire season.

When alone, a magpie may make a quiet musical warbling; these complex melodious warbles or subsongs are pitched at 2–4 KHz and do not carry for long distances. These songs have been recorded as being up to 70 minutes long, and are more frequent after the end of the breeding season. Pairs of magpies often take up a loud musical calling known as &quot;carolling&quot; to advertise or defend their territory; one bird initiates the call with the second (and sometimes more) joining in. Often preceded by warbling, carolling is pitched between 6 and 8 kHz and has 4–5 elements with slurring indistinct noise in between. Birds adopt a specific posture by tilting their heads back, expanding their chests, and moving their wings backwards. A group of magpies sing a short repetitive version of carolling just before dawn (&quot;dawn song&quot;), and at twilight after sundown (&quot;dusk song&quot;), in winter and spring.

Fledgling and juvenile magpies emit a repeated short and loud (80 dB), high-pitched (8 kHz) begging call. Magpies may indulge in beak-clapping to warn other species of birds. They employ several high pitched (8–10 kHz) alarm or rallying calls when intruders or threats are spotted. Distinct calls have been recorded for the approach of eagles and monitor lizards.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Australian magpie is found in the Trans-Fly region of southern New Guinea, between the Oriomo River and Muli Strait, and across most of Australia, bar the tip of Cape York, the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts, and the southwest of Tasmania.

The Australian magpie prefers open areas such as grassland, fields and residential areas such as parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with scattered trees or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly on the ground in these open areas. It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations; birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas. In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (&quot;Vanellus miles&quot;) have been implicated.

===New Zealand===

Birds taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria were introduced into New Zealand by local Acclimatisation Societies of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s, with the Wellington Acclimatisation Society releasing 260 birds in 1874. White-backed forms are spread on both the North and eastern South Island, while black-backed forms are found in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region. Magpies were introduced into New Zealand to control agricultural pests, and were therefore a protected species until 1951. They are thought to affect native New Zealand bird populations such as the tūī and kererū, sometimes raiding nests for eggs and nestlings, although studies by Waikato University have cast doubt on this, and much blame on the magpie as a predator in the past has been anecdotal only. Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Sri Lanka, although the species has failed to become established. It has become established in western Taveuni in Fiji, however.

==Behaviour==
The Australian magpie is almost exclusively diurnal, although it may call into the night, like some other members of the Artamidae. Natural predators of magpies include various species of monitor lizard and the barking owl. Birds are often killed on roads or electrocuted by powerlines, or poisoned after killing and eating house sparrows, mice, rats or rabbits that have eaten poison bait. The Australian raven may take nestlings left unattended.

On the ground, the Australian magpie moves around by walking, and is the only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, although birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.

The magpie is generally sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy and defend the same territory for many years. Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a raptor results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves either side of the bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory. A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the &quot;negotiating display&quot;, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory while the rest of the group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a &quot;group strength display&quot;, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory. The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie&#x27;s group.

A wide variety of displays are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The &quot;manus flutter&quot; is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter the primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and fly off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting to bring down the leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.

A 2022 study showed cooperative behaviour, along with a moderate level of problem-solving, when magpies (&quot;G. tibicen&quot;) assisted one another to remove tracking devices placed on their bodies in a specially-designed harness by researchers for conservation purposes. This was the first recorded example of birds acting in this way to remove tracking devices, a form of rescue behaviour.

===Breeding===
Magpies have a long breeding season which varies in different parts of the country; in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September, but not commence until August or September in cooler regions, and may continue until January in some alpine areas. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark. Near human habitation, synthetic material may be incorporated. Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed high up in a tree fork, often in an exposed position. The trees used are most commonly eucalypts, although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced pine, &quot;Crataegus&quot;, and elm have been recorded. Other bird species, such as the yellow-rumped thornbill (&quot;Acanthiza chrysorrhoa&quot;), willie wagtail (&quot;Rhipidura leucophrys&quot;), southern whiteface (&quot;Aphelocephala leucopsis&quot;), and (less commonly) noisy miner (&quot;Manorina melanocephala&quot;), often nest in the same tree as the magpie. The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a magpie nest, while the diminutive striated pardalote (&quot;Pardalotus striatus&quot;) has been known to make a burrow for breeding into the base of the magpie nest itself. These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies. The channel-billed cuckoo (&quot;Scythrops novaehollandiae&quot;) is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia; magpies will raise cuckoo young, which eventually outcompete the magpie nestlings.

The Australian magpie produces a clutch of two to five light blue or greenish eggs, which are oval in shape and about . The chicks hatch synchronously around 20 days after incubation begins; like all passerines, the chicks are altricial—they are born pink, naked, and blind with large feet, a short broad beak and a bright red throat. Their eyes are fully open at around 10 days. Chicks develop fine downy feathers on their head, back and wings in the first week, and pinfeathers in the second week. The black and white colouration is noticeable from an early stage. Nestlings are usually fed exclusively by the female, though the male magpie will feed his partner. Individual males do feed nestlings and fledglings, to varying degrees, from sporadic to equal frequency to the female. The Australian magpie is known to engage in cooperative breeding, and helper birds will assist in feeding and raising young. This does vary from region to region, and with the size of the group—the behaviour is rare or non-existent in pairs or small groups.

Juvenile magpies begin foraging on their own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year. The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.

===Feeding===
The Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items located at or near ground level including invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, snails, spiders and scorpions as well as a wide variety of insects—cockroaches, ants, earwigs, beetles, cicadas, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Insects, including large adult grasshoppers, may be seized mid-flight. Skinks, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet. 

It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous cane toad by flipping it over and consuming the underparts. Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae. One study showed birds were able to find scarab beetle larvae by sound or vibration. Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food. Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees, stinging ants and wasps and irritating hairs of caterpillars before swallowing.

==Swooping==
Magpies are ubiquitous in urban areas all over Australia, and have become accustomed to people. A small percentage of birds become highly aggressive during breeding season from late August to late November – early December or occasionally late February to late April – early May, and will swoop and sometimes attack passersby. Attacks begin as the eggs hatch, increase in frequency and severity as the chicks grow, and tail off as the chicks leave the nest. 

Magpie attacks occur in most parts of Australia, though Tasmanian magpies are much less aggressive than their mainland counterparts. Magpie attacks can cause injuries, typically wounds to the head. Being unexpectedly swooped while cycling can result in loss of control of the bicycle, which may cause injury or even fatal accidents. 

Magpies may engage in an escalating series of behaviours to drive off intruders. Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops, where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby. Next in intensity are close swoops, where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and audibly &quot;snap&quot; their beaks or even peck or bite at the face, neck, ears or eyes. More rarely, a bird may dive-bomb and strike the intruder&#x27;s (usually a cyclist&#x27;s) head with its chest. A magpie may rarely attack by landing on the ground in front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim&#x27;s chest and pecking at the face and eyes. 

===Targets===
The percentage of magpies that swoop has been difficult to estimate but is less than 9%. Almost all attacking birds (around 99%) are male, and they are generally known to attack pedestrians at around from their nest, and cyclists at around . There appears to be some specificity in choice of attack targets, with the majority of individuals specializing on either pedestrians or cyclists. 

Younger people, lone people, and people travelling quickly (i.e., runners and cyclists) appear to be targeted most often by swooping magpies. Anecdotal evidence suggests that if a magpie sees a human trying to rescue a chick that has fallen from its nest, the bird will view this help as predation, and will become more aggressive to humans from then on. Some attacks have indirectly been fatal. For example, in 2021, a Brisbane woman tripped and fell onto her infant while attempting to avoid a swooping, and the infant died. 

===Prevention===
Magpies are a protected native species in Australia, so it is illegal to kill or harm them. However, some states provide exceptions for a magpie that attacks a human, allowing a particularly aggressive bird to be killed. Such a provision is made, for example, in section 54 of the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act. More commonly, an aggressive bird will be caught and relocated to an unpopulated area. Magpies have to be moved a considerable distance, as almost all are able to find their way home from distances of less than . Removing the nest is of no use, as birds will breed again and possibly be more aggressive the second time around.

If it is necessary to walk near the nest, wearing a broad-brimmed or legionnaire&#x27;s hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds, but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value, as birds attack the sides of the head and neck. Magpies prefer to swoop at the back of the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight at all times can discourage the bird. A basic disguise such as sunglasses worn on the back of the head may fool the magpie as to where a person is looking. Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists. Cyclists can deter attack by attaching a long pole with a flag to a bike, and the use of cable ties on helmets has become common and appears to be effective. 

Some claim that hand-feeding magpies can reduce the risk of swooping. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, will return to the same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success. 

==Cultural references==

The Australian magpie featured in aboriginal folklore around Australia. The Yindjibarndi people of the Pilbara in the northwest of the country used the bird as a signal for sunrise, awakening them with its call. They were also familiar with its highly territorial nature, and it features in a song in their &quot;Burndud&quot;, or songs of customs. It was a totem bird of the people of the Illawarra region south of Sydney.

Under the name piping shrike, the white-backed magpie was declared the official emblem of the Government of South Australia in 1901 by Governor Tennyson, and has featured on the South Australian flag since 1904. The magpie is a commonly used emblem of sporting teams in Australia, and its brash, cocky attitude has been likened to the Australian psyche. Such teams tend to wear uniforms with black and white stripes. The Collingwood Football Club adopted the magpie from a visiting South Australian representative team in 1892. The Port Adelaide Magpies would likewise adopt the black and white colours and Magpie name in 1902. Other examples include Brisbane&#x27;s Souths Logan Magpies and Sydney&#x27;s Western Suburbs Magpies. Disputes over who has been the first club to adopt the magpie emblem have been heated at times. Another club, Glenorchy Football Club of Tasmania, was forced to change uniform design when placed in the same league as another club (Claremont Magpies) with the same emblem.

In New Zealand, the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Rugby Union team, from Napier, New Zealand, is also known as the magpies. One of the best-known New Zealand poems is &quot;The Magpies&quot; by Denis Glover, with its refrain &quot;Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle&quot;, imitating the sound of the bird – and the popular New Zealand comic &quot;Footrot Flats&quot; features a magpie character by the name of Pew. Other magpies depicted in fiction include: Magpie in Colin Thiele&#x27;s 1974 children&#x27;s book &quot;Magpie Island&quot;, Miss Magpie in &quot;The Adventures of Blinky Bill&quot;, and Penguin the magpie in &quot;Penguin Bloom&quot;. The sculpture &quot;Big Swoop&quot; in central Canberra was installed in Garema Place on 16 March 2022. 
The Australian Magpie won the inaugural Australian Bird of the Year poll conducted by &quot;Guardian Australia&quot; and BirdLife Australia in late 2017. The Australian magpie won the 2017 contest with 19,926 votes (13.3%), narrowly ahead of the Australian white ibis. The magpie slumped to the #4 place in the 2019 poll, and to the #9 place in the 2021 poll. The voting rules changed in all three years of the Bird of the Year poll, which may have affected the results. The magpie also won a 2023 ABC Science poll for Australia&#x27;s favourite animal sound.

<doc id="195782" wikidata="Q930135" url="?curid=195782" title="Super Fly (soundtrack)">
<text>Super Fly is the third studio album by American soul musician Curtis Mayfield, released on July 11, 1972, by Curtom Records. It was released as the soundtrack for the Blaxploitation film of the same name. A classic of 1970s soul and funk music, &quot;Super Fly&quot; was a nearly immediate hit. Its sales were bolstered by two million-selling singles, &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot; (number 2 R&amp;B charts, number 4 Pop charts) and the title track (number 5 R&amp;B, number 8 Pop). &quot;Super Fly&quot; is one of the few soundtracks to out-gross the film it accompanied.

&quot;Super Fly&quot;, along with Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; (1971), was one of the pioneering soul concept albums, with its then-unique socially aware lyrics about poverty and drug abuse making the album stand out. The film and the soundtrack may be perceived as dissonant, since the film holds rather ambiguous views on drug dealers, whereas Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s position is far more critical. Like &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, the album was a surprise hit that record executives felt had little chance at significant sales. Due to its success, Mayfield was tapped for several film soundtracks over the course of the decade.

==Background==

Mayfield had previously contributed two songs to &quot;Krakatoa, East of Java&quot;; the film was a critical and commercial failure, but marked his first foray into soundtrack work. His contribution began when &quot;Super Fly&quot; director Gordon Parks Jr. asked Mayfield and his backing band to cameo as a nightclub act in the background of a scene. Parks wanted a full song to play in the scene, which led to the beginning of soundtrack sessions.

==Production==

The recording session for the song &quot;Pusherman&quot; took place at Bell Sound Studios in New York, and was followed by a several months-long hiatus (during which Mayfield wrote &quot;The Times Have Changed&quot; for his former group The Impressions and formulated his next solo effort, &quot;Back to the World&quot;). The instrumentals for the remaining songs were produced in a three-day session at Curtom Studios, which involved an in-studio band of as many as 40 performers. Guitarist Craig McMullen states, &quot;The advantage of it is, if you have a full orchestra, when you place your licks, you don&#x27;t have to worry about your licks bumping. You can hear everything that&#x27;s going to go down.&quot; The album was primarily written by Mayfield from a basement apartment in Chicago while undergoing a trial separation from his wife and children.

==Release==
&quot;Super Fly&quot; was originally released in 1972 on Curtom Records in both LP and eight-track formats. It also featured distribution in countries outside of the United States, including Italy, Germany, France, Canada, and the United Kingdom. On November 11, 1997, Rhino Records released a 25th Anniversary collection of the album with a bonus disc of demo versions of songs, radio spots, and interviews. In 1999, Rhino Records reissued the album with two bonus tracks.
On December 11, 2001, the British record label Charly Records re-released the album with several bonus tracks.

==Reception, sales and legacy==
Music critics lauded &quot;Super Fly&quot;. The album was RIAA certified Gold within three months of release. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Bob Donat was favorable of Mayfield&#x27;s anti-drug and self-liberation themes, and called &quot;Super Fly&quot; &quot;not only a superior, imaginative soundtrack, but fine funky music as well and the best of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s four albums made since he left the Impressions&quot;. Rock critic Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album an A− and lauded Mayfield&#x27;s songwriting. Christgau also wrote that &quot;these songs speak for (and to) the ghetto&#x27;s victims rather than its achievers (cf. &#x27;The Other Side of Town&#x27;, on &quot;Curtis&quot;), transmitting bleak lyrics through uncompromisingly vivacious music. Message: both candor and rhythm are essential to our survival&quot;. Robin Katz of &quot;Disc&quot; praised the album stating to not mistake the album as a &quot;big bad blaring instrumental LP. This is Curtis Mayfield combining a fine musical message with gentle vocals but powerful lyrics.&quot; and that the &quot;nine tracks on the album and what never fails to amaze me is how Mayfield balances his instrumental work and lyrics without overdoing either. It is a touchy situation, but Mayfield handles it brilliantly.&quot;The album itself as well as songs &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot; and &quot;Junkie Chase&quot; received nominations at the 15th Annual Grammy Awards.

In a 2004 review of the album, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Super Fly&quot; five out of five stars and cited it as Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;creative breakthrough&quot;. Charles Taylor of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, in an article on Mayfield, deems &quot;Superfly,&quot; &quot;Pusherman&quot; and &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot; to &quot;remain his paramount achievement, as hard and pitiless as any music ever to make the charts.&quot; John Bush of AllMusic praised the album&#x27;s lyrical substance and sound, calling it a &quot;melange of deep, dark grooves, trademarked wah-wah guitar, and stinging brass&quot;. On its significance, Bush concluded by stating:

In a positive retrospective review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, writer Mychal Smith notes the political relevance of &quot;Super Fly&quot;&#x27;s messages to early 70&#x27;s U.S. politics, in particular the issues facing the black population:

In the &quot;Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2002), writer Colin Larkin gave the album a five-star rating. In 2003, VH1 named &quot;Super Fly&quot; the 63rd greatest album of all time. The title track was selected by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 69 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 72 in a 2012 revised list, and 76 in a 2020 revised list. The album is ranked number 986 in &quot;All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (3rd edition, 2000). In 2019, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

&quot;Super Fly&quot; was a formative work in the development of the hip hop and rap genres, and has been cited as an influence and sampled by the likes of Beastie Boys, The Notorious B.I.G., Erykah Badu, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Chance the Rapper, and Beyoncé. The singer Bilal names it among his 25 favorite albums, explaining that, &quot;I just think that&#x27;s one of the best movie soundtrack albums ever. Just the way he described the whole movie, you don&#x27;t even really have to see the movie, just listen to the soundtrack and you already know the whole movie. It&#x27;s just killer the way he did that.&quot; Mychal Smith notes the impact &quot;Super Fly&quot; had on the genre of blaxploitation soundtracks in particular, noting Mayfield had &quot;inspired imitations [...] such as Bobby Womack’s &quot;Across 110th Street&quot;, James Brown’s &quot;Black Caesar&quot;, and Willie Hutch’s &quot;The Mack&quot;.&quot;

<text>The yellow-billed magpie &quot;(Pica nuttalli)&quot;, also known as the California magpie, is a large corvid that inhabits California&#x27;s Central Valley and the adjacent chaparral foothills and mountains. Apart from its having a yellow bill and a yellow streak around the eye, it is virtually identical to the black-billed magpie &quot;(Pica hudsonia)&quot; found in much of the rest of North America. 
The scientific name commemorates the English naturalist Thomas Nuttall.

==Taxonomy==
mtDNA sequence analysis indicates a close relationship between the yellow-billed magpie and the black-billed magpie, rather than between the outwardly very similar black-billed and European magpies (&quot;P. pica&quot;).

The Korean subspecies of the European magpie (&quot;P. p. sericea&quot;) is more distantly related to all other (including North American) forms judging from the molecular evidence, and thus, either the North American forms are maintained as specifically distinct. The Korean (and possibly related) subspecies are also elevated to species status, or all magpies are considered to be subspecies of a single species, &quot;Pica pica&quot;.

Combining fossil evidence and paleobiogeographical considerations with the molecular data indicates that the yellow-billed magpie&#x27;s ancestors became isolated in California quite soon after the ancestral magpies colonized North America due to early ice ages and the ongoing uplift of the Sierra Nevada, but that during interglacials there occurred some gene flow between the yellow- and black-billed magpies until reproductive isolation was fully achieved in the Pleistocene.

The yellow-billed magpie is adapted to the hot summers of California&#x27;s Central Valley and experiences less heat stress than the black-billed magpie.

==Behaviour==
The yellow-billed magpie is gregarious and roosts communally. There may be a cluster of communal roosts in one general area made up of a central roost containing many birds and several outlying roosts with fewer.

Yellow-billed magpie flocks are known to engage in funeral-like behavior for their dead. When a magpie dies, a gathering of them congregates around the deceased bird where they call out loudly for 10–15 minutes.

===Breeding===
The yellow-billed magpie prefers groves of tall trees along rivers and near open areas, though in some cities they have begun to nest in vacant lots and other weedy places. A pair of birds build a dome-shaped nest with sticks and mud on a high branch. Nests maybe 14 meters above the ground and are sometimes built far out on long branches to prevent predators from reaching them. They nest in small colonies, or occasionally alone. Even when nesting close to other birds they may exhibit some territorial behavior. These birds are permanent residents and do not usually wander far outside of their breeding range.

Extra-pair copulation is not uncommon among yellow-billed magpies. After mating, a male will exhibit mate-guarding, preventing the female from mating with other males until she lays the first egg. The clutch contains 5 to 7 eggs which are incubated by the female for 16 to 18 days. Both parents feed the nestlings a diet of mostly insects until fledging occurs in 30 days.

===Food and feeding===

These omnivorous birds forage on the ground, mainly eating insects, especially grasshoppers, but also carrion, acorns and fruit in fall and winter. They are attracted to recently butchered carcasses on farms and ranches. They pick through garbage at landfills and dumping sites, and sometimes hunt rodents.

==Diseases==
This bird is extremely susceptible to West Nile virus. Between 2004 and 2006 it is estimated that 50% of all yellow-billed magpies died of the virus. Because the bird tends to roost near water bodies such as rivers, it is often exposed to mosquitoes.

Avian poxvirus is another contagious viral infection that Yellow-billed magpies face that have raised concerns for their population. It has been documented in some individuals, leading to the development of skin lesions, nodules, and sometimes death. While the prevalence of avian poxvirus in Yellow-billed magpies varies, it is considered a potential concern for the species.

The birds are also at risk of lead poisoning, primarily due to the ingestion of spent lead ammunition fragments found in carrion or discarded game animals. Lead poisoning has been a significant issue for scavenging birds, and efforts to reduce the use of lead ammunition in hunting areas adjacent to Yellow-billed magpie habitats are being undertaken to mitigate this threat.

==Conservation==
The IUCN classifies the bird as a vulnerable species. The Nature Conservancy places it in the vulnerable category. Besides West Nile Virus, threats include loss of habitat and rodent poison. The bird has a limited area of distribution but is widespread throughout the area and still common in many places.

Habitat Loss is the ongoing urbanization and agricultural development in California&#x27;s Central Valley have led to the destruction and fragmentation of the Yellow-billed magpie&#x27;s preferred nesting and foraging habitats. As groves of tall trees are cleared for development, the available breeding sites for these birds are diminishing.

Rodent Poison also is the use of rodenticides and pesticides in agricultural and urban areas poses a direct threat to the Yellow-billed magpie population. These chemicals can contaminate the bird&#x27;s food sources and have detrimental effects on their health.

Climate Change and its associated impacts, such as increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, may affect the availability of the bird&#x27;s food sources and nesting sites. Prolonged droughts and extreme weather events can further stress their populations.

Conservation Efforts where several organizations, including The Nature Conservancy and local conservation groups, are actively engaged in efforts to protect and preserve the Yellow-billed magpie. These efforts include habitat restoration, monitoring of populations, and education campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of safeguarding this species.

<doc id="195791" wikidata="Q2714911" url="?curid=195791" title="Nataša Mićić">
<text>Nataša Mićić (; Jovanović; born 2 November 1965) is a Serbian lawyer and politician who served as the president of the National Assembly of Serbia from 2001 to 2004 and as the acting president of Serbia from 2002 to 2004.

Mićić graduated from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Law School and found employment as a clerk at the Užice Municipal Court during the early 1990s. She left the post in 1998 to pursue a career as a lawyer. Even though she was almost 33 at the time, she ended up as one of the founders of the Otpor! student movement, acting as their spokesperson and legal counsel.

==Political career==
Mićić&#x27;s law and political careers frequently overlapped. She became a GSS member in 1996 while still employed at Užice court. By the time Slobodan Milošević was overthrown in the autumn of 2000, Mićić was a high-ranking GSS official (within a large DOS coalition at the time). In late December 2000, DOS overwhelmingly won the parliamentary elections and GSS members were allocated their share of political posts. Nataša Mićić became the parliamentary vice-president in January 2001 – deputy to Dragan Maršićanin from Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS).

===Parliamentary President (Speaker) 2001–2003===
After Dragan Maršićanin resigned his post on 6 December 2001 as a result of the growing conflict between DSS MPs and the remaining DOS MPs, Mićić immediately replaced him as the president of National Assembly and the chairman of its Constitutional Committee.

As Milan Milutinović&#x27;s mandate as the President of Serbia expired, and two presidential elections were voided because turnout fell short of required 50%, she became the acting President of Serbia on 30 December 2002, with a constitutional obligation to call another election within 60 days of taking over the acting post. She did not do so in the required period, leading to a chorus of criticism.

Following the assassination of Zoran Đinđić on 12 March 2003, a state of emergency was immediately declared under her command.

By May of the same year, the situation had calmed and the state of emergency was lifted. For Mićić, however, the fall of 2003 would become a crucial period in her political career.

Firstly, on 17 September 2003, over six months after the required constitutional period expired, she finally announced a 16 November date for a third attempt at electing a President for Serbia. She then experienced continuous parliamentary pressure because of the voting scandal involving DOS MP Neda Arnerić.

On 16 October 2003 after the ruling DOS coalition was left without a parliamentary majority for the first time in almost three years, a motion for a no-confidence vote proceeding started for the parliamentary president Nataša Mićić. The parliamentary discussion on this issue finished on 29 October 2003, but the actual non-confidence vote was postponed for a fortnight.

In the end, it proved unnecessary, as on 13 November 2003, just three days before the presidential elections that would later be void again because of low turnout, Mićić dissolved parliament and called for parliamentary elections on 28 December 2003.

===Back in opposition===
The GSS entered the new parliamentary elections on the Democratic Party (DS) ballot, and was given 2 seats out of the total 31 that the DS list got.

Nataša Mićić became one of GSS MPs, while Goran Svilanović got the other seat. In December 2004, she was elected to be GSS president. After the merger of the Civic Alliance of Serbia into the Liberal Democratic Party in 2007, she became the vice-president of the Liberal Democratic Party.

==Personal life==
Nataša Mićić is married to Miodrag Mićić, member of GSS municipal board in Užice.

In late March 2006, her husband was in the news for phoning and reportedly verbally threatening journalist Nenad Kovačević from the &quot;Danas&quot; daily. Kovačević revealed Miodrag Mićić called him up on 30 March 2006, reportedly angry about Kovačević&#x27;s piece in the previous day&#x27;s issue of &quot;Danas&quot; that references the fact that six Serbian Assembly Members of Parliament from Užice declared their personal monthly income to be over RSD1.2 million (~€15,000). Nobody was mentioned by name but Miodrag Mićić apparently thought it obvious the article alludes to him and his wife, and allegedly decided to menace Kovačević over the phone by reportedly proclaiming: &quot;If anything happens to my home, my wife or my child, the same will happen to your family and your kids; you singled out my home and my family by writing this article&quot;.

While admitting to calling up Kovačević and &quot;reacting hastily after getting into an argument [with the journalist]&quot;, Miodrag Mićić denied using the exact words ascribed to him.

<doc id="195792" wikidata="Q254057" url="?curid=195792" title="Black-billed magpie">
<text>The black-billed magpie (Pica hudsonia), also known as the American magpie, is a bird in the corvid family found in the western half of North America. It is black and white, with the wings and tail showing black areas and iridescent hints of blue and blue-green. It was once thought to be a subspecies of &quot;Pica pica&quot;, which was known as the black-billed magpie at the time, but was placed into its own species in 2000 based on genetic studies. Currently, &quot;Pica pica&quot; is the scientific name of the Eurasian magpie.

This species prefers generally open habitats with clumps of trees, but can also commonly be found in farmlands and suburban areas. Historically associated with bison herds, it now lands on the backs of cattle to glean ticks and insects from them. Black-billed magpies commonly follow large predators, such as wolves, to scavenge from their kills. The species also walks or hops on the ground, where it obtains food items such as beetles, grasshoppers, worms, and small rodents.

The black-billed magpie builds domed nests which are made up of twigs and are located near the top of trees, usually housing six to seven eggs. Incubation, by the female only, starts when the clutch is complete, and lasts 16–21 days. The nestling period is three to four weeks. Black-billed magpies in the wild have a lifespan of six to seven years.

Black-billed magpies have a long history with humans, being featured in stories told by Indigenous tribes of the Great Plains. Where persecuted it becomes very wary, but otherwise it is fairly tolerant of human presence. Due to their perceived negative impact on cattle and game birds, black-billed magpies were hunted as a pest during the 1900s, and their population suffered as a result. Today, they are considered a species of least concern by the IUCN, and they are commonly seen throughout their range.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The black-billed magpie was originally described in 1823 as &quot;Corvus Hudsonius&quot; by Joseph Sabine. In previous encounters with the species prior to its description, it was presumed to be of the same species as the magpies from Europe, which at the time were also known as black-billed magpies. Based on the black-billed magpie&#x27;s smaller size and longer tail and wing length, it was classified as the subspecies &quot;P. pica hudsonia&quot;. The generic name &quot;Pica&quot; is the Latin word for magpie, and the specific name &quot;hudsonia&quot; is in honour of the English explorer Henry Hudson.

The word &quot;magpie&quot; comes from a combination of &quot;Mag&quot;, which was a nickname for Margaret, and &quot;pie&quot;, which was the Middle English word for the Eurasian magpie. The name Margaret was associated with chattiness in the early 15th century, and was applied to the magpie because its vocalizations were thought to sound like a person chattering.

The black-billed magpie was widely considered conspecific with the Eurasian magpie until mtDNA studies showed a relatively high divergence between the two species. The species consisting of the black-billed and Eurasian magpies was called the black-billed magpie in English, and its scientific name was &quot;Pica pica&quot;. It was also shown that the black-billed magpie was more closely related to California&#x27;s yellow-billed magpie (&quot;Pica nuttalli&quot;). Black-billed magpies are also shown to have different social behaviours and vocalizations from the Eurasian magpie, further indicating separate species. In 2000, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union recognized the black-billed magpie as a separate species, &quot;Pica hudsonia&quot;.

Fossil evidence suggests that the ancestral North American magpie arrived in its current range around the mid-Pliocene, approximately 3–4 mya, having crossed the Bering land bridge. From there, the Eurasian and North American populations began to differentiate. The yellow-billed magpie lineage likely split off soon after due to the Sierra Nevada uplift and the beginning of an ice age. A comparatively low genetic difference, however, suggests that some gene flow between the black-billed and yellow-billed magpies still occurred during interglacial periods until the Pleistocene.

==Description==
The black-billed magpie is an unmistakable bird within its range. It is a medium-sized bird that measures from tip to tail. It is largely black, with white scapulars, belly, and primaries, and the wings and tail are an iridescent blue-green. The tail is made up of long, layered feathers, the middle pair of which extend further than the rest. The beak is uniformly black, oblong, and weakly curved toward the tip. Adults also have black irises.

Unlike other members of the Corvidae family, the black-billed magpie is dimorphic in size and weight, though there can be overlap between the sexes. Males are, on average, six to nine percent larger and sixteen to twenty-four percent heavier than females, at , an individual wing chord of , and tail lengths of . Females weigh between , have individual wing chords of , and tail lengths of .

Juveniles have less iridescence on their wings and tail, buffier scapulars and belly, and they lack the distinctive long tail feathers. Their rectrices are typically rounder and narrower, and have more black on their wing-tips compared to mature adults. They also have pink mouth-linings and grey irises. All juvenile features will typically be gone by the first year&#x27;s moult.

The black-billed magpie can be distinguished from the similar yellow-billed magpie by its longer tail and by the colour of the beak. Eurasian magpies are visually very similar to black-billed magpies; however, Eurasian magpies are slightly larger and have shorter tails and wings. They can also be distinguished based on their different vocalizations, as well as by their non-overlapping ranges.

===Vocalizations===
The vocalizations of the black-billed magpie consist of a number of calls variously described as tweets, coos, purrs, shrills and squawks, but the most common is an alarm call, called a chatter, that is described as a &quot;ka-ka-ka-ka&quot;, sometimes preceded with a &quot;skah-skah&quot;. This call is very different from that of the Eurasian magpie and is similar to that of the yellow-billed magpie. At least one black-billed magpie, living with humans, has learned to imitate human speech.

==Distribution and habitat==
Black-billed magpies are generally non-migratory, however some winter movement does occur. While the exact reason for these movements is unknown, it is thought to be a result of postbreeding dispersal and a subsequent return to their nesting sites. This species ranges from coastal southern Alaska, southwest Yukon Territory, central British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba in the north, through the Rocky Mountains down south to all the Rocky Mountain states including New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, and some bordering states as well. The range can extend as far east as northern Minnesota and Iowa, with casual records in northern Wisconsin and upper Michigan, but is thought to be limited further east and south by high temperature and humidity. The species is absent in California west of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada ranges, where it is replaced by the yellow-billed magpie.

During the breeding season the preferred habitat is riparian areas with thickets. The predilection for open habitats with clumps of trees means that the species lives in meadows and suburbs. Outside the breeding season, magpies can be found in their breeding habitat but also near feedlots, grain elevators, landfills, and around barns and houses.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding and nesting===

Adult black-billed magpie typically form pairs which last year-round and often for life, in which case the remaining magpie may find another mate. &quot;Divorces&quot; are possible; one South Dakota study found low rates of divorce (8%) but one study in Alberta found that pairs had a 63% divorce rate over a 7-year period.

Black-billed magpies nest individually, and often situate their nests near the top of trees. Only the nest tree and its immediate surroundings are defended, and so it is possible for nests to be somewhat clumped in a location. When this happens (usually in areas with a limited number of trees or with abundant food resources), a diffuse colony is formed. In this, the black-billed magpie is intermediate between the Eurasian magpie, whose nests are much more spread out because a large territory is defended around each nest, and the yellow-billed magpie, which is always loosely colonial.

Nests are loose but large accumulations of branches, twigs, grass, rootlets, mud, fur, and other materials. Branches and twigs constitute the base and framework, while mud is used as anchor and in the nest cup. The cup is lined with materials found nearby, often grass, rootlets, and other soft material. A hood or dome is present on almost all nests, and if formed of twigs and branches that are loosely assembled. The nest will usually have a single side entrance. Nests are built by both sexes over 40–50 days, starting in February (though later in northern parts of the range). Nests have been shown to be quite durable, and occasionally old nests are repaired and reused across multiple breeding seasons.

If regularly disturbed, black-billed magpie pairs will aggressively defend their nest. If the disturbances continue, they will eventually either move the eggs or abandon the clutch altogether. Biologists who have climbed nest trees to measure magpie eggs have reported that the parents recognized them personally on subsequent days and started to mob them, overlooking other people in the vicinity.

Black-billed magpies generally start breeding in late March, with the breeding season ending in early July. While they typically only nest once per year, a second nesting may take place if the initial nesting fails early. The average clutch size is six or seven eggs, however females may lay up to thirteen eggs. The eggs are greenish grey, marked with browns, and long. Incubation lasts 16–21 days and is done only by the female. Hatching is often asynchronous, and hatched young are altricial, brooded by the female but fed by both sexes. Juveniles are able to fly 3–4 weeks after hatching, and will feed with adults for about two months before leaving to join other juvenile magpies. Fledging success (usually 3–4 young per nest) is lower than the typical clutch size; this is not an unusual state of affairs in species with asynchronous hatching, as some nestlings often die of starvation. Black-billed magpies reach sexual maturity at one or two years of age. The lifespan of the species in the wild is about four to six years.

===Feeding===
The black-billed magpie is an opportunistic omnivore, eating whatever is readily available, including carrion, insects, seeds, berries, and nuts. When living near humans, they will also eat garbage and food from pets or livestock that are fed outside. They have been known to hunt rodents, reptiles, amphibians, small birds, and have also been seen eating eggs of other birds. Black-billed magpies primarily feed on animal matter during the summer, and in the winter switch to more vegetation. Chicks are fed animal matter almost exclusively. Magpies typically forage on the ground, scratching with their feet or beaks to turn over ground litter. They often follow large predators, such as wolves, to scavenge or steal from their kills. They sometimes land on large mammals, such as moose, cattle, or deer, to pick at the ticks that often plague these animals.

Black-billed magpies are also known to make food caches in the ground, in scatter-hoarding fashion. To make a cache, the bird pushes or hammers its bill into the ground (or snow), forming a small hole into which it deposits the food items it was holding in a small pouch under its tongue. It may, however, then move the food to another location, particularly if other magpies in the vicinity are watching. Cache robbing is fairly common, so a magpie often makes several false caches before a real one. The final cache is covered with grass, leaves, or twigs. After this, the bird cocks its head and stares at the cache, possibly to commit the site to memory. Such hoards are short-term; the food is usually recovered within several days, or the bird never returns. The bird relocates its caches by sight and also by smell; during cache robbing, smell is probably the primary cue.

===Social interactions===
Black-billed magpies often form loose flocks outside of the breeding season. Dominance hierarchies typically develop within such flocks, more linearly among males than among females. Dominants can steal food from subordinates. Aggressive interactions also occur at point sources of food. Surprisingly, young males appear dominant over adult males, though this may simply reflect the adults&#x27; lack of motivation to engage in fights as they can more easily find food. Fights are rare and involve jumps and kicks. Dominance is more generally established through displays, such as stretching the body laterally with the bill raised and the nictitating membrane of the eye flashing (only on the side of the opponent).

Magpies often gather excitedly in trees near the body of a dead magpie, calling loudly, a poorly-understood behaviour called a funeral.

===Roosting===
Magpies tend to roost communally in winter. Every evening they fly, often in groups and sometimes over long distances, to reach safe roosting sites such as dense trees or shrubs that impede predator movement, or, at higher latitudes, dense conifers that afford good wind protection. In Canada, they arrive at the roosting site earlier in the evening and leave later in the morning on colder days. At the roosting site, they tend to occupy trees singly; they do not huddle. They sleep with the bill tucked under the scapular (shoulder) and back feathers, adopting this position sooner on colder nights. During the night, they may also regurgitate in the form of pellets the undigested parts of what they ate during the day. Such pellets can be found on the ground and then used to determine at least part of the birds&#x27; diet.

===Flight===

Level flight appears slow and labored. As measured in wind tunnels, minimum and maximum sustained flight speeds are , respectively. Flight is commonly interrupted by nonflapping phases. Descents from heights consist of repeated J-shaped swoops with the wings nearly closed.

==Relationship with humans==
Black-billed magpies feature in stories told by various Indigenous tribes from the Great Plains. One story, sometimes known as &quot;The Great Race&quot;, features a magpie working with humans in a race against the bison to determine who would be hunter and who would be prey. The race was narrowly won by the magpie, who had clung to the back of the bison until near the end, making humans the hunters and bison the hunted.

When Lewis and Clark first encountered black-billed magpies in 1804 in South Dakota, they reported the birds as being very bold, entering tents and taking food from the hand. Magpies formerly followed American bison herds, from which they would glean ticks and other insects, as well as the Indigenous tribes that hunted the bison so they could scavenge carcasses. When the bison herds were devastated in the 1870s, magpies switched to cattle, and by the 1960s, they had also moved into the emerging towns and cities of the West. Today, black-billed magpies remain relatively tame in areas where they are not hunted. However, they become very wary in areas where they are often shot at or disturbed. Black-billed magpies were thought to be harmful to the population of game birds (due to them sometimes stealing bird eggs) and domestic stock (pecking at sores on cattle), and were systematically trapped or shot during the first half of the 20th century. Bounties of one cent per egg or two cents per head were offered in many states. In 1933, bounty hunters in the Okanogan valley in Washington shot 1,033 magpies. Magpies also died as a result of eating poison set out for predators.

Black-billed magpies are considered a pest by some because of their reputation for stealing smaller songbird eggs. Studies have shown, however, that eggs make up only a small proportion of what magpies feed on during the reproductive season, and that other songbird populations do not fare worse in the presence of magpies.

A common misconception about magpies in general is that they like to steal bright or shiny things. This reputation belongs to the Eurasian magpie (&quot;Pica pica&quot;) rather than the black-billed magpie, and at any rate an experiment conducted at Exeter University has shown that the reputation is undeserved. Eurasian magpies displayed caution around shiny objects rather than being attracted to them.

==Conservation status==
Because of its wide range and generally stable population, the black-billed magpie is rated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. As of 2015, the Government of Canada estimates the population to be between 500,000 and 5,000,000 adults.

In the United States, black-billed magpies are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, but &quot;[a] Federal permit shall not be required to control ... [magpies] when found committing or about to commit depredations upon ornamental or shade trees, agricultural crops, livestock, or wildlife, or when concentrated in such numbers and manner as to constitute a health hazard or other nuisance&quot;. State or local regulations may limit or prohibit killing these birds as well.

In Canada, however, black-billed magpies do not appear on the list of birds protected by the Migratory Birds Convention Act. Provincial laws also apply, but in Alberta, magpies may be hunted and trapped without a license.

A detriment to the overall black-billed magpie population is toxic chemicals, particularly topical pesticides applied on the backs of livestock. Because black-billed magpies sometimes glean ticks off the backs of cattle, this proves a problem. However, in some areas, it has benefited from forest fragmentation and agricultural developments. Like many corvids, it is susceptible to West Nile virus.

<text>In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a metric tensor (or simply metric) is an additional structure on a manifold (such as a surface) that allows defining distances and angles, just as the inner product on a Euclidean space allows defining distances and angles there. More precisely, a metric tensor at a point of is a bilinear form defined on the tangent space at (that is, a bilinear function that maps pairs of tangent vectors to real numbers), and a metric field on consists of a metric tensor at each point of that varies smoothly with .

A metric tensor is &quot;positive-definite&quot; if for every nonzero vector . A manifold equipped with a positive-definite metric tensor is known as a Riemannian manifold. Such a metric tensor can be thought of as specifying &quot;infinitesimal&quot; distance on the manifold. On a Riemannian manifold , the length of a smooth curve between two points and can be defined by integration, and the distance between and can be defined as the infimum of the lengths of all such curves; this makes a metric space. Conversely, the metric tensor itself is the derivative of the distance function (taken in a suitable manner).

While the notion of a metric tensor was known in some sense to mathematicians such as Gauss from the early 19th century, it was not until the early 20th century that its properties as a tensor were understood by, in particular, Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita, who first codified the notion of a tensor. The metric tensor is an example of a tensor field.

The components of a metric tensor in a coordinate basis take on the form of a symmetric matrix whose entries transform covariantly under changes to the coordinate system. Thus a metric tensor is a covariant symmetric tensor. From the coordinate-independent point of view, a metric tensor field is defined to be a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on each tangent space that varies smoothly from point to point.

Carl Friedrich Gauss in his 1827 &quot;Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas&quot; (&quot;General investigations of curved surfaces&quot;) considered a surface parametrically, with the Cartesian coordinates , , and of points on the surface depending on two auxiliary variables and . Thus a parametric surface is (in today&#x27;s terms) a vector-valued function

:formula_1

depending on an ordered pair of real variables , and defined in an open set in the -plane. One of the chief aims of Gauss&#x27;s investigations was to deduce those features of the surface which could be described by a function which would remain unchanged if the surface underwent a transformation in space (such as bending the surface without stretching it), or a change in the particular parametric form of the same geometrical surface.

One natural such invariant quantity is the length of a curve drawn along the surface. Another is the angle between a pair of curves drawn along the surface and meeting at a common point. A third such quantity is the area of a piece of the surface. The study of these invariants of a surface led Gauss to introduce the predecessor of the modern notion of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor is formula_2 in the description below; E, F, and G in the matrix can contain any number as long as the matrix is positive definite.
===Arc length===
If the variables and are taken to depend on a third variable, , taking values in an interval , then will trace out a parametric curve in parametric surface . The arc length of that curve is given by the integral

: formula_3

where formula_4 represents the Euclidean norm. Here the chain rule has been applied, and the subscripts denote partial derivatives:

:formula_5

The integrand is the restriction to the curve of the square root of the (quadratic) differential

where

The quantity in () is called the line element, while is called the first fundamental form of . Intuitively, it represents the principal part of the square of the displacement undergone by when is increased by units, and is increased by units.

Using matrix notation, the first fundamental form becomes
:formula_6

===Coordinate transformations===
Suppose now that a different parameterization is selected, by allowing and to depend on another pair of variables and . Then the analog of () for the new variables is
The chain rule relates , , and to , , and via the matrix equation

where the superscript T denotes the matrix transpose. The matrix with the coefficients , , and arranged in this way therefore transforms by the Jacobian matrix of the coordinate change

:formula_7

A matrix which transforms in this way is one kind of what is called a tensor. The matrix

:formula_8

with the transformation law () is known as the metric tensor of the surface.

===Invariance of arclength under coordinate transformations===
 first observed the significance of a system of coefficients , , and , that transformed in this way on passing from one system of coordinates to another. The upshot is that the first fundamental form () is &quot;invariant&quot; under changes in the coordinate system, and that this follows exclusively from the transformation properties of , , and . Indeed, by the chain rule,

:formula_9

so that

:formula_10

===Length and angle===
Another interpretation of the metric tensor, also considered by Gauss, is that it provides a way in which to compute the length of tangent vectors to the surface, as well as the angle between two tangent vectors. In contemporary terms, the metric tensor allows one to compute the dot product(non-euclidean geometry) of tangent vectors in a manner independent of the parametric description of the surface. Any tangent vector at a point of the parametric surface can be written in the form

:formula_11

for suitable real numbers and . If two tangent vectors are given:

:formula_12

then using the bilinearity of the dot product,

:formula_13

This is plainly a function of the four variables , , , and . It is more profitably viewed, however, as a function that takes a pair of arguments and which are vectors in the -plane. That is, put

:formula_14

This is a symmetric function in and , meaning that

:formula_15

It is also bilinear, meaning that it is linear in each variable and separately. That is,

:formula_16

for any vectors , , , and in the plane, and any real numbers and .

In particular, the length of a tangent vector is given by

:formula_17

and the angle between two vectors and is calculated by

:formula_18

===Area===
The surface area is another numerical quantity which should depend only on the surface itself, and not on how it is parameterized. If the surface is parameterized by the function over the domain in the -plane, then the surface area of is given by the integral

:formula_19

where denotes the cross product, and the absolute value denotes the length of a vector in Euclidean space. By Lagrange&#x27;s identity for the cross product, the integral can be written

:formula_20

where is the determinant.

==Definition==
Let be a smooth manifold of dimension ; for instance a surface (in the case ) or hypersurface in the Cartesian space formula_21. At each point there is a vector space , called the tangent space, consisting of all tangent vectors to the manifold at the point . A metric tensor at is a function which takes as inputs a pair of tangent vectors and at , and produces as an output a real number (scalar), so that the following conditions are satisfied:
* is bilinear. A function of two vector arguments is bilinear if it is linear separately in each argument. Thus if , , are three tangent vectors at and and are real numbers, then formula_22
* is symmetric. A function of two vector arguments is symmetric provided that for all vectors and , formula_23
* is nondegenerate. A bilinear function is nondegenerate provided that, for every tangent vector , the function formula_24 obtained by holding constant and allowing to vary is not identically zero. That is, for every there exists a such that .

A metric tensor field on assigns to each point of a metric tensor in the tangent space at in a way that varies smoothly with . More precisely, given any open subset of manifold and any (smooth) vector fields and on , the real function
formula_25
is a smooth function of .

==Components of the metric==

The components of the metric in any basis of vector fields, or frame, are given by

The functions form the entries of an symmetric matrix, . If
:formula_26
are two vectors at , then the value of the metric applied to and is determined by the coefficients () by bilinearity:

:formula_27

Denoting the matrix by and arranging the components of the vectors and into column vectors and ,

:formula_28

where T and T denote the transpose of the vectors and , respectively. Under a change of basis of the form

:formula_29

for some invertible matrix , the matrix of components of the metric changes by as well. That is,

:formula_30

or, in terms of the entries of this matrix,

:formula_31

For this reason, the system of quantities is said to transform covariantly with respect to changes in the frame .

===Metric in coordinates===
A system of real-valued functions , giving a local coordinate system on an open set in , determines a basis of vector fields on 
:formula_32

The metric has components relative to this frame given by
:formula_33

Relative to a new system of local coordinates, say
:formula_34

the metric tensor will determine a different matrix of coefficients,
:formula_35

This new system of functions is related to the original by means of the chain rule
:formula_36

so that
:formula_37

Or, in terms of the matrices and ,
:formula_38

where denotes the Jacobian matrix of the coordinate change.

===Signature of a metric===
Associated to any metric tensor is the quadratic form defined in each tangent space by

:formula_39

If is positive for all non-zero , then the metric is positive-definite at . If the metric is positive-definite at every , then is called a Riemannian metric. More generally, if the quadratic forms have constant signature independent of , then the signature of is this signature, and is called a pseudo-Riemannian metric. If is connected, then the signature of does not depend on .

By Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia, a basis of tangent vectors can be chosen locally so that the quadratic form diagonalizes in the following manner

:formula_40

for some between 1 and . Any two such expressions of (at the same point of ) will have the same number of positive signs. The signature of is the pair of integers , signifying that there are positive signs and negative signs in any such expression. Equivalently, the metric has signature if the matrix of the metric has positive and negative eigenvalues.

Certain metric signatures which arise frequently in applications are:
* If has signature , then is a Riemannian metric, and is called a Riemannian manifold. Otherwise, is a pseudo-Riemannian metric, and is called a pseudo-Riemannian manifold (the term semi-Riemannian is also used).
* If is four-dimensional with signature or , then the metric is called Lorentzian. More generally, a metric tensor in dimension other than 4 of signature or is sometimes also called Lorentzian.
* If is -dimensional and has signature , then the metric is called ultrahyperbolic.

===Inverse metric===
Let be a basis of vector fields, and as above let be the matrix of coefficients
:formula_41
One can consider the inverse matrix , which is identified with the inverse metric (or &quot;conjugate&quot; or &quot;dual metric&quot;). The inverse metric satisfies a transformation law when the frame is changed by a matrix via

The inverse metric transforms &quot;contravariantly&quot;, or with respect to the inverse of the change of basis matrix . Whereas the metric itself provides a way to measure the length of (or angle between) vector fields, the inverse metric supplies a means of measuring the length of (or angle between) covector fields; that is, fields of linear functionals.

To see this, suppose that is a covector field. To wit, for each point , determines a function defined on tangent vectors at so that the following linearity condition holds for all tangent vectors and , and all real numbers and :

:formula_42

As varies, is assumed to be a smooth function in the sense that

:formula_43

is a smooth function of for any smooth vector field .

Any covector field has components in the basis of vector fields . These are determined by

:formula_44

Denote the row vector of these components by

:formula_45

Under a change of by a matrix , changes by the rule

:formula_46

That is, the row vector of components transforms as a &quot;covariant&quot; vector.

For a pair and of covector fields, define the inverse metric applied to these two covectors by

The resulting definition, although it involves the choice of basis , does not actually depend on in an essential way. Indeed, changing basis to gives

:formula_47

So that the right-hand side of equation () is unaffected by changing the basis to any other basis whatsoever. Consequently, the equation may be assigned a meaning independently of the choice of basis. The entries of the matrix are denoted by , where the indices and have been raised to indicate the transformation law ().

===Raising and lowering indices===

In a basis of vector fields , any smooth tangent vector field can be written in the form

for some uniquely determined smooth functions . Upon changing the basis by a nonsingular matrix , the coefficients change in such a way that equation () remains true. That is,

:formula_48

Consequently, . In other words, the components of a vector transform &quot;contravariantly&quot; (that is, inversely or in the opposite way) under a change of basis by the nonsingular matrix . The contravariance of the components of is notationally designated by placing the indices of in the upper position.

A frame also allows covectors to be expressed in terms of their components. For the basis of vector fields define the dual basis to be the linear functionals such that

:formula_49

That is, , the Kronecker delta. Let

:formula_50

Under a change of basis for a nonsingular matrix , transforms via

:formula_51

Any linear functional on tangent vectors can be expanded in terms of the dual basis 

where denotes the row vector . The components transform when the basis is replaced by in such a way that equation () continues to hold. That is,

:formula_52

whence, because , it follows that . That is, the components transform &quot;covariantly&quot; (by the matrix rather than its inverse). The covariance of the components of is notationally designated by placing the indices of in the lower position.

Now, the metric tensor gives a means to identify vectors and covectors as follows. Holding fixed, the function

:formula_53

of tangent vector defines a linear functional on the tangent space at . This operation takes a vector at a point and produces a covector . In a basis of vector fields , if a vector field has components , then the components of the covector field in the dual basis are given by the entries of the row vector
:formula_54

Under a change of basis , the right-hand side of this equation transforms via
:formula_55

so that : transforms covariantly. The operation of associating to the (contravariant) components of a vector field T the (covariant) components of the covector field , where
:formula_56

is called lowering the index.

To &quot;raise the index&quot;, one applies the same construction but with the inverse metric instead of the metric. If are the components of a covector in the dual basis , then the column vector

has components which transform contravariantly:
:formula_57

Consequently, the quantity does not depend on the choice of basis in an essential way, and thus defines a vector field on . The operation () associating to the (covariant) components of a covector the (contravariant) components of a vector given is called raising the index. In components, () is
:formula_58

===Induced metric===

Let be an open set in , and let be a continuously differentiable function from into the Euclidean space , where . The mapping is called an immersion if its differential is injective at every point of . The image of is called an immersed submanifold. More specifically, for , which means that the ambient Euclidean space is , the induced metric tensor is called the first fundamental form.

Suppose that is an immersion onto the submanifold . The usual Euclidean dot product in is a metric which, when restricted to vectors tangent to , gives a means for taking the dot product of these tangent vectors. This is called the induced metric.

Suppose that is a tangent vector at a point of , say
:formula_59

where are the standard coordinate vectors in . When is applied to , the vector goes over to the vector tangent to given by
:formula_60

(This is called the pushforward of along .) Given two such vectors, and , the induced metric is defined by
:formula_61

It follows from a straightforward calculation that the matrix of the induced metric in the basis of coordinate vector fields is given by
:formula_62

where is the Jacobian matrix:
:formula_63

==Intrinsic definitions of a metric==
The notion of a metric can be defined intrinsically using the language of fiber bundles and vector bundles. In these terms, a metric tensor is a function

from the fiber product of the tangent bundle of with itself to such that the restriction of to each fiber is a nondegenerate bilinear mapping

:formula_64

The mapping () is required to be continuous, and often continuously differentiable, smooth, or real analytic, depending on the case of interest, and whether can support such a structure.

===Metric as a section of a bundle===
By the universal property of the tensor product, any bilinear mapping () gives rise naturally to a section of the dual of the tensor product bundle of with itself

:formula_65

The section is defined on simple elements of by

:formula_66

and is defined on arbitrary elements of by extending linearly to linear combinations of simple elements. The original bilinear form is symmetric if and only if
:formula_67
where
:formula_68
is the braiding map.

Since is finite-dimensional, there is a natural isomorphism

:formula_69

so that is regarded also as a section of the bundle of the cotangent bundle with itself. Since is symmetric as a bilinear mapping, it follows that is a symmetric tensor.

===Metric in a vector bundle===

More generally, one may speak of a metric in a vector bundle. If is a vector bundle over a manifold , then a metric is a mapping

:formula_70

from the fiber product of to which is bilinear in each fiber:

:formula_71

Using duality as above, a metric is often identified with a section of the tensor product bundle .

===Tangent–cotangent isomorphism===

The metric tensor gives a natural isomorphism from the tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle, sometimes called the musical isomorphism. This isomorphism is obtained by setting, for each tangent vector ,

:formula_72

the linear functional on which sends a tangent vector at to . That is, in terms of the pairing between and its dual space ,

:formula_73

for all tangent vectors and . The mapping is a linear transformation from to . It follows from the definition of non-degeneracy that the kernel of is reduced to zero, and so by the rank–nullity theorem, is a linear isomorphism. Furthermore, is a symmetric linear transformation in the sense that

:formula_74

for all tangent vectors and .

Conversely, any linear isomorphism defines a non-degenerate bilinear form on by means of

:formula_75

This bilinear form is symmetric if and only if is symmetric. There is thus a natural one-to-one correspondence between symmetric bilinear forms on and symmetric linear isomorphisms of to the dual .

As varies over , defines a section of the bundle of vector bundle isomorphisms of the tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle. This section has the same smoothness as : it is continuous, differentiable, smooth, or real-analytic according as . The mapping , which associates to every vector field on a covector field on gives an abstract formulation of &quot;lowering the index&quot; on a vector field. The inverse of is a mapping which, analogously, gives an abstract formulation of &quot;raising the index&quot; on a covector field.

The inverse defines a linear mapping
:formula_76

which is nonsingular and symmetric in the sense that
:formula_77

for all covectors , . Such a nonsingular symmetric mapping gives rise (by the tensor-hom adjunction) to a map
:formula_78

or by the double dual isomorphism to a section of the tensor product
:formula_79

==Arclength and the line element==
Suppose that is a Riemannian metric on . In a local coordinate system , , the metric tensor appears as a matrix, denoted here by , whose entries are the components of the metric tensor relative to the coordinate vector fields.

Let be a piecewise-differentiable parametric curve in , for . The arclength of the curve is defined by

:formula_80

In connection with this geometrical application, the quadratic differential form

:formula_81

is called the first fundamental form associated to the metric, while is the line element. When is pulled back to the image of a curve in , it represents the square of the differential with respect to arclength.

For a pseudo-Riemannian metric, the length formula above is not always defined, because the term under the square root may become negative. We generally only define the length of a curve when the quantity under the square root is always of one sign or the other. In this case, define

:formula_82

While these formulas use coordinate expressions, they are in fact independent of the coordinates chosen; they depend only on the metric, and the curve along which the formula is integrated.

===The energy, variational principles and geodesics===
Given a segment of a curve, another frequently defined quantity is the (kinetic) energy of the curve:

:formula_83

This usage comes from physics, specifically, classical mechanics, where the integral can be seen to directly correspond to the kinetic energy of a point particle moving on the surface of a manifold. Thus, for example, in Jacobi&#x27;s formulation of Maupertuis&#x27; principle, the metric tensor can be seen to correspond to the mass tensor of a moving particle.

In many cases, whenever a calculation calls for the length to be used, a similar calculation using the energy may be done as well. This often leads to simpler formulas by avoiding the need for the square-root. Thus, for example, the geodesic equations may be obtained by applying variational principles to either the length or the energy. In the latter case, the geodesic equations are seen to arise from the principle of least action: they describe the motion of a &quot;free particle&quot; (a particle feeling no forces) that is confined to move on the manifold, but otherwise moves freely, with constant momentum, within the manifold.

==Canonical measure and volume form==
In analogy with the case of surfaces, a metric tensor on an -dimensional paracompact manifold gives rise to a natural way to measure the -dimensional volume of subsets of the manifold. The resulting natural positive Borel measure allows one to develop a theory of integrating functions on the manifold by means of the associated Lebesgue integral.

A measure can be defined, by the Riesz representation theorem, by giving a positive linear functional on the space of compactly supported continuous functions on . More precisely, if is a manifold with a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric tensor , then there is a unique positive Borel measure such that for any coordinate chart ,
formula_84
for all supported in . Here is the determinant of the matrix formed by the components of the metric tensor in the coordinate chart. That is well-defined on functions supported in coordinate neighborhoods is justified by Jacobian change of variables. It extends to a unique positive linear functional on by means of a partition of unity.

If is also oriented, then it is possible to define a natural volume form from the metric tensor. In a positively oriented coordinate system the volume form is represented as
formula_85
where the are the coordinate differentials and denotes the exterior product in the algebra of differential forms. The volume form also gives a way to integrate functions on the manifold, and this geometric integral agrees with the integral obtained by the canonical Borel measure.

==Examples==

===Euclidean metric===
The most familiar example is that of elementary Euclidean geometry: the two-dimensional Euclidean metric tensor. In the usual Cartesian coordinates, we can write

:formula_86

The length of a curve reduces to the formula:

:formula_87

The Euclidean metric in some other common coordinate systems can be written as follows.

Polar coordinates :
:formula_88

So
:formula_89
by trigonometric identities.

In general, in a Cartesian coordinate system on a Euclidean space, the partial derivatives are orthonormal with respect to the Euclidean metric. Thus the metric tensor is the Kronecker delta δ&quot;ij&quot; in this coordinate system. The metric tensor with respect to arbitrary (possibly curvilinear) coordinates is given by
:formula_90

====The round metric on a sphere====
The unit sphere in comes equipped with a natural metric induced from the ambient Euclidean metric, through the process explained in the induced metric section. In standard spherical coordinates , with the colatitude, the angle measured from the -axis, and the angle from the -axis in the -plane, the metric takes the form

:formula_91

This is usually written in the form

:formula_92

===Lorentzian metrics from relativity===

In flat Minkowski space (special relativity), with coordinates
:formula_93

the metric is, depending on choice of metric signature,
:formula_94

For a curve with—for example—constant time coordinate, the length formula with this metric reduces to the usual length formula. For a timelike curve, the length formula gives the proper time along the curve.

In this case, the spacetime interval is written as
:formula_95

The Schwarzschild metric describes the spacetime around a spherically symmetric body, such as a planet, or a black hole. With coordinates
:formula_96

we can write the metric as
:formula_97

where (inside the matrix) is the gravitational constant and represents the total mass–energy content of the central object.

<text>New York Dolls is the debut studio album by the American rock band New York Dolls, released on July 27, 1973, by Mercury Records. An influential precursor to the 1970s punk rock movement, the eponymous album has been acclaimed as one of the best debut records in rock music and one of the greatest rock albums ever.

In early 1973, the two-year-old band had developed a local fanbase by playing regularly in New York City&#x27;s lower Manhattan, but most music producers and record companies were reluctant to work with them because of their vulgarity and onstage fashion as well as homophobia in New York. Still, the Dolls signed a contract with Mercury and recorded their first album at the Record Plant in New York with producer Todd Rundgren, who was known for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren captured how the band sounded live. The resulting music on the album – a mix of carefree rock and roll, influences from Brill Building pop, and campy sensibilities – explores themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity, as rendered in Johansen&#x27;s colloquial and ambiguous lyrics. The album cover featured the members in drag for shock value.

&quot;New York Dolls&quot; received acclaim but sold poorly and polarized listeners. The band proved difficult to market outside their native New York and developed a reputation for rock-star excesses while touring the United States in support of the album. Despite its commercial failure, &quot;New York Dolls&quot; helped shape the 1970s punk rock movement; the group&#x27;s crude musicianship and youthful attitude challenged the prevailing trend of musical sophistication in popular music, particularly progressive rock.

== Background ==
In 1971, vocalist David Johansen formed the New York Dolls with guitarists Johnny Thunders and Rick Rivets, bassist Arthur Kane, and drummer Billy Murcia; Rivets was replaced by Sylvain Sylvain in 1972. The band was meant to be a temporary project for the members, who were club-going youths that had gone to New York City with different career pursuits. As Sylvain recalled, &quot;We just said &#x27;Hey, maybe this will get us some chicks.&#x27; That seemed like a good enough reason.&quot; He and Murcia originally planned to work in the clothing business and opened a boutique on Lexington Avenue that was across the street from a toy repair shop called the New York Doll Hospital, which gave them the idea for their name. The group soon began playing regularly in lower Manhattan and earned a cult following within a few months with their reckless style of rock music. Nonetheless, record companies were hesitant to sign them because of their onstage cross-dressing and blatant vulgarity.

In October 1972, the group garnered the interest of critics when they opened for English rock band the Faces at the Empire Pool in Wembley. However, on the New York Dolls&#x27; first tour of England that year, Murcia died after consuming a lethal combination of alcohol and methaqualone. They enlisted Jerry Nolan as his replacement, while managers Marty Thau, Steve Leber, and David Krebs still struggled to find the band a record deal.

After returning to New York, the Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max&#x27;s Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to &quot;fake it until they could make it&quot;: &quot;We had to make ourselves &quot;feel&quot; famous before we could actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass &#x27;Excalibur&#x27; after King Arthur. It was crazy.&quot; Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A&amp;R executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: &quot;I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after the show he called me and said, &#x27;You should have stayed. I think they&#x27;re really special.&#x27; Then, after that, I fell in love with them anyway.&quot; In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members&#x27; parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.

=== Hiring of Todd Rundgren ===
For the New York Dolls&#x27; debut album, Mercury wanted to find a record producer who could make the most out of the group&#x27;s sound and the hype they had received from critics and fans in New York. At the band&#x27;s first board meeting in Chicago, Johansen fell asleep in Mercury&#x27;s conference room while record executives discussed potential producers. He awoke when they mentioned Todd Rundgren, a musician and producer who by 1972 had achieved unexpected rock stardom with his double album &quot;Something/Anything?&quot; and its hit singles &quot;I Saw the Light&quot; and &quot;Hello It&#x27;s Me&quot;. Rundgren had socialized at venues such as Max&#x27;s Kansas City and first saw the Dolls when his girlfriend at the time, model Bebe Buell, brought him there to see them play.

Known for having refined pop tastes and technologically savvy productions, Rundgren had become increasingly interested in progressive rock sounds by the time he was enlisted to produce the New York Dolls&#x27; debut album. Consequently, his initial impression of the group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by the standards of other unsophisticated New York bands. &quot;The Dolls weren&#x27;t out to expand any musical horizons&quot;, said Rundgren, although he enjoyed Thunders&#x27; &quot;attitude&quot; and Johansen&#x27;s charismatic antics onstage. Johansen had thought of Rundgren as &quot;an expert on second rate rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, but also said the band was &quot;kind of persona non grata, at the time, with most producers. They were afraid of us, I don&#x27;t know why, but Todd wasn&#x27;t. We all liked him from Max&#x27;s ... Todd was cool and he was a producer.&quot; Sylvain, on the other hand, felt the decision to enlist him was based on availability, time, and money: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a long list. Todd was in New York and seemed like he could handle the pace.&quot; Upon being hired, Rundgren declared that &quot;the only person who can produce a New York record is someone who lives in New York&quot;.
== Recording and production ==
Mercury booked the Dolls at the Record Plant in New York City for recording sessions in April 1973. Rundgren was originally concerned that they had taken &quot;the worst sounding studio in the city at that time&quot; because it was the only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: &quot;The Dolls were critics&#x27; darlings and the press had kind of adopted them. Plus, there were lots of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate.&quot; &quot;New York Dolls&quot; was recorded there in eight days on a budget of $17,000 (equivalent to $ in ). With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows. In Johansen&#x27;s own words, &quot;we went into a room and just recorded. It wasn&#x27;t like these people who conceptualize things. It was just a document of what was going on at the time.&quot;

In the studio, the New York Dolls dressed in their usual flashy clothes. Rundgren, who did not approve of their raucous sound, at one point yelled at them during the sessions to &quot;get the glitter out of your asses and play&quot;. Sylvain recalled Rundgren inviting Buell and their Chihuahua to the studio and putting the latter atop an expensive mixing console, while Johansen acknowledged that his recollections of the sessions have since been distorted by what he has read about them: &quot;It was like the 1920s, with palm tree décor and stuff. Well, that&#x27;s how I remember it, anyway.&quot; He also said Rundgren directed the band from the control room with engineer Jack Douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album. According to Scoppa, the group&#x27;s carefree lifestyle probably conflicted with Rundgren&#x27;s professional work ethic and schedule: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t put up with bullshit. I mean, [the band] rarely started their live sets before midnight, so who knows? Todd was very much in charge in the studio, however, and I got the impression that everybody was looking to him.&quot;

Although Sylvain said Rundgren was not an interfering producer, he occasionally involved himself to improve a take. Sylvain recalled moments when Rundgren went into the isolation booth with Nolan when he struggled keeping a beat and drummed out beats on a cowbell for him to use as a click track. During another session, he stopped a take and walked out of the control room to plug in Kane&#x27;s bass cabinet. Scoppa, who paid afternoon visits to the studio, overheard Rundgren say, &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s all you needed. Okay, let&#x27;s try it again!&quot;, and ultimately found the exchange funny and indicative of Rundgren&#x27;s opinion of the band: &quot;Todd was such a &#x27;musician&#x27; while they were just getting by on attitude and energy. But as disdainful as he appeared to be at some points he got the job done really well.&quot; Rundgren felt Johansen&#x27;s wild singing often sounded screamed or drunken but also eloquent in the sense that Johansen demonstrated a &quot;propensity to incorporate certain cultural references into the music&quot;, particularly on &quot;Personality Crisis&quot;. While recording the song, Johansen walked back into the control room and asked Rundgren if his vocals sounded &quot;ludicrous enough&quot;.

Because the Dolls had little money, Sylvain and Thunders played the austerely designed and affordable Gibson Les Paul Junior guitars on the record. They jokingly referred to them as &quot;automatic guitars&quot; due to their limited sound shaping features. To amplify their guitars, they ran a Marshall Plexi standalone amplifier through the speaker cabinets of a Fender Dual Showman, and occasionally used a Fender Twin Reverb.

Some songs were embellished with additional instruments, including Buddy Bowser&#x27;s brassy saxophone on &quot;Lonely Planet Boy&quot;. Johansen sang into distorted guitar pickups for additional vocals and overdubbed them into the song. He also played an Asian gong for &quot;Vietnamese Baby&quot; and harmonica on &quot;Pills&quot;. For &quot;Personality Crisis&quot;, Sylvain originally played on the Record Plant&#x27;s Yamaha grand piano before Rundgren added his own piano flourishes to both that song and &quot;Private World&quot;. Rundgren also contributed to the background vocals heard on &quot;Trash&quot; and played synthesizers on &quot;Vietnamese Baby&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein (Orig.)&quot;, which Sylvain recalled: &quot;I remember him getting those weird sounds from this beautiful old Moog synthesizer he brought in. He said it was a model that only he and the Beatles had.&quot;

&quot;New York Dolls&quot; was mixed in less than half a day. Rundgren felt the band seemed distracted and disinterested at that point, so he tried unsuccessfully to ban them from the mixing session. For the final mix, he minimized the sound of Nolan&#x27;s drumming. In retrospect, Rundgren said the quality of the mix was poor because the band had hurried and questioned him while mixing the record: &quot;It&#x27;s too easy for it to become a free-for-all, with every musician only hearing their own part and not the whole. They all had other places to be, so rather than split, they rushed the thing and if that wasn&#x27;t enough they took it to the crappy mastering lab that Mercury had put them in.&quot; Thunders famously complained to a journalist that Rundgren &quot;fucked up the mix&quot; on &quot;New York Dolls&quot;, adding to stories that the two had clashed during the album&#x27;s recording. Both Johansen and Scoppa later said they did not see any conflict between the two and that Thunders&#x27; typically foolish behavior was misinterpreted. Johansen later praised Rundgren for how he enhanced and equalized each instrument, giving listeners the impression that &quot;[they&#x27;re] in a room and there&#x27;s a band playing&quot;, while Sylvain said his mix accurately captured how the band sounded live.

== Music and lyrics ==

&quot;New York Dolls&quot; features ten original songs and one cover – the 1963 Bo Diddley song &quot;Pills&quot;. Johansen describes the album as &quot;a little jewel of urban folk art&quot;. Rundgren, on the other hand, says the band&#x27;s sensibilities were different from &quot;the urban New York thing&quot; because they had been raised outside Manhattan and drew on carefree rock and roll and Brill Building pop influences such as the Shangri-Las: &quot;Their songs, as punky as they were, usually had a lot to do with the same old boy-girl thing but in a much more inebriated way.&quot; Johansen quotes the lyric &quot;when I say I&#x27;m in love, you&#x27;d best believe I&#x27;m in love L-U-V&quot; from the Shangri-Las&#x27; &quot;Give Him a Great Big Kiss&quot; (1964) when opening &quot;Looking for a Kiss&quot;, which tells a story of adolescent romantic desire hampered by peers who use drugs. On &quot;Subway Train&quot;, he uses lyrics from the American folk standard &quot;Someone&#x27;s in the Kitchen with Dinah&quot;. In the opinion of critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the album&#x27;s rowdy hard rock songs also revamp riffs from Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones, resulting in music that sounds edgy and threatening in spite of the New York Dolls&#x27; wittingly kitsch and camp sensibilities. &quot;Personality Crisis&quot; features raunchy dual guitars, boogie-woogie piano, and a histrionic pause, while &quot;Trash&quot; is a punky pop rock song with brassy singing.
Several songs on &quot;New York Dolls&quot; function as what Robert Hilburn deems to be &quot;colorful, if exaggerated, expressions of teen alienation&quot;. According to Robert Christgau, because many of Manhattan&#x27;s white youths at the time were wealthy and somewhat artsy, only ill-behaved young people from the outer boroughs like the band could &quot;capture the oppressive excitement Manhattan holds for a half-formed human being&quot;. &quot;Private World&quot;, an escapist plea for stability, was co-written by Kane, who rarely contributed as a songwriter and felt overwhelmed as a young adult in the music business. Sylvain jokingly says &quot;Frankenstein (Orig.)&quot; was titled with the parenthetical qualifier because rock musician Edgar Winter had released his song of the same name before the band could record their own: &quot;Our song &#x27;Frankenstein&#x27; was a big hit in our live show ... Now, his thing didn&#x27;t sound at all like ours, but I&#x27;m sure he stole our title.&quot; Johansen, the band&#x27;s main lyricist, says &quot;Frankenstein (Orig.)&quot; is about &quot;how kids come to Manhattan from all over, they&#x27;re kind of like whipped dogs, they&#x27;re very repressed. Their bodies and brains are disoriented from each other ... it&#x27;s a love song.&quot; In interpreting the song&#x27;s titular monster, Frank Kogan writes that it serves as a personification for New York and its ethos, while Johansen asking listeners if they &quot;could make it with Frankenstein&quot; involves more than sexual slang:

Although the Dolls exhibit tongue-in-cheek qualities, Todd Wicks observes a streetwise realism in the album&#x27;s songs. In Christgau&#x27;s opinion, Johansen&#x27;s colloquial and morally superior lyrics are imbued with humor and a sense of human limits in songs whose fundamental theme is authenticity. This theme is explored in stories about lost youths, as on &quot;Subway Train&quot;, or in a study of a specific subject, such as the &quot;schizy imagemonger&quot; on &quot;Personality Crisis&quot;. He argues that beneath the band&#x27;s decadent and campy surface are lyrics about &quot;the modern world ... one nuclear bomb could blow it all away. Pills and personality crises weren&#x27;t evils – easy, necessary, or whatever. They were strategies and tropisms and positive pleasures&quot;. According to journalist Steve Taylor, &quot;Vietnamese Baby&quot; deals with the impact of the Vietnam War at the time on everyday activities for people, whose fun is undermined by thoughts of collective guilt.

On songs such as &quot;Subway Train&quot; and &quot;Trash&quot;, Johansen uses ambiguity as a lyrical mode. In Kogan&#x27;s opinion, Johansen sings in an occasionally unintelligible manner and writes in a perplexing, fictional style that is lazy yet ingenious, as it provides his lyrics an abundance of &quot;emotional meaning&quot; and interpretation: &quot;David never provides an objective framework, he&#x27;s always jumping from voice to voice, so you&#x27;re hearing a character addressing another character, or the narrator addressing the character, or the character or the narrator addressing us, all jammed up together so you&#x27;re hearing bits of conversation and bits of subjective description in no kind of chronological order. But as someone says in &#x27;Vietnamese Baby&#x27;: &#x27;Everything connects.&#x27;&quot; On &quot;Trash&quot;, Johansen undercuts his vaguely pansexual beliefs with the possibility of going to &quot;fairyland&quot; if he takes a &quot;lover&#x27;s leap&quot; with the song&#x27;s subject.

== Marketing and sales ==
&quot;New York Dolls&quot; was released on July 27, 1973, in the United States and on October 19 in the United Kingdom. Its controversial cover featured the band dressed in exaggerated drag, including high wigs, messy make-up, high heels, and garters. The photo was used for shock value, and on the back of the album, the band is photographed in their usual stage wear. To announce the album&#x27;s release, Mercury published an advertisement slogan that read &quot;Introducing The New York Dolls: A Band You&#x27;re Gonna Like, Whether You Like It Or Not&quot;, while other ads called them &quot;The Band You Love to Hate&quot;. Two double A-sided, 7-inch singles were released – &quot;Trash&quot; / &quot;Personality Crisis&quot; in July and &quot;Jet Boy&quot; / &quot;Vietnamese Baby&quot; in November 1973 – neither of which charted.

&quot;New York Dolls&quot; was commercially unsuccessful and only reached number 116 on the American Top LPs while in the UK it failed to chart altogether. The record sold over 100,000 copies at the time and fell well short of expectations in the press. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2003, it ended up selling fewer than 500,000 copies. Music journalist Phil Strongman said its commercial failure could be attributed to the New York Dolls&#x27; divisive effect on listeners, including writers from the same magazine. In a feature story on the band for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; prior to the album, Mark Plummer had dismissed their playing as the poorest he had ever seen, while the magazine&#x27;s reporter Michael Watts viewed them as an encouraging albeit momentary presence in what he felt was a lifeless rock and roll scene at the time. In &quot;Creem&quot;″s readers poll, the album earned the band awards in the categories of &quot;Best New Group of the Year&quot; and &quot;Worst New Group of the Year&quot;.

After the album&#x27;s release, the Dolls toured the US as a supporting act for English rock band Mott the Hoople. Reviews complimented their songwriting, Thunders and Sylvain&#x27;s guitar interplay, and noted their campy fashion and the resemblance of Johansen and Thunders to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. However, some critics panned them as an unserious group of amateurs who could not play or sing. During their appearance on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in the UK, the show&#x27;s host Bob Harris dismissed their music as &quot;mock rock&quot; in his on-air comments. They also developed a reputation for rock-star excesses, including drugs, groupies, trashed hotel rooms, and public disturbances, and according to Ben Edmonds of &quot;Creem&quot;, became &quot;the most walked-out-on band in the history of show business&quot;. Strongman wrote that the band and the album were difficult to market because of their kitschy style and how Murcia&#x27;s death had exacerbated their association with hard drugs, which &quot;wasn&#x27;t altogether true in the early days&quot;. They remained the most popular band in New York City, where their Halloween night concert at the Waldorf Astoria in 1973 drew hundreds of young fans and local television coverage.

== Critical reception and legacy ==
&quot;New York Dolls&quot; received acclaim from contemporary reviewers. In a rave review for &quot;NME&quot;, published in August 1973, Nick Kent said the band&#x27;s raunchy style of rock and roll had been vividly recorded by Rundgren on an album that, besides Iggy and the Stooges&#x27; &quot;Raw Power&quot; (1973), serves as the only one &quot;so far to fully define just exactly where 1970s rock should be coming from&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; founder and editor Ira Robbins viewed &quot;New York Dolls&quot; as an innovative record, brilliantly chaotic, and well produced by Rundgren. Ellen Willis, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, said it is by far 1973&#x27;s most compelling hard rock album and that at least half of its songs are immediate classics, particularly &quot;Personality Crisis&quot; and &quot;Trash&quot;, which she called &quot;transcendent&quot;. In &quot;Newsday&quot;, Christgau hailed the New York Dolls as &quot;the best hard rock band in the country and maybe the world right now&quot;, writing that their &quot;special genius&quot; is combining the shrewd songwriting savvy of early-1960s pop with the anarchic sound of late-1960s heavy metal. He claimed that the record&#x27;s frenzied approach, various emotions, and wild noise convey Manhattan&#x27;s harsh, deviant thrill better than the Velvet Underground.

In an overall positive review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Tony Glover found the band&#x27;s impressive live sound to be mostly preserved on the album. However, he was slightly critical of production flourishes and overdubs, feeling that they make some lyrics sound incomprehensible and some choruses too sonorous. Although he was surprised at how well Rundgren&#x27;s production works with the group&#x27;s raunchy sound on most of the songs, Glover ultimately asked whether or not &quot;the record alone will impress as much as seeing them live (they&#x27;re a highly &quot;watchable&quot; group).&quot; Years later, Christgau would also voice that the album is &quot;in fact a little botched aurally&quot;, but still regarded it as a classic.

=== Impact and reappraisal ===
&quot;New York Dolls&quot; has been called one of the greatest debut albums in rock music, one of the genre&#x27;s most popular cult records, and a foundation for the late 1970s punk rock movement. Chuck Eddy considers it crucial to rock&#x27;s evolution. The album influenced many rock and roll, punk, and glam rock groups, including the Ramones, Kiss, the Sex Pistols, the Damned, and Guns N&#x27; Roses. Chris Smith, in &quot;101 Albums That Changed Popular Music&quot; (2009), says the Dolls&#x27;s amateurish musicianship on the album undermined the musical sophistication of earlier popular music such as Pink Floyd&#x27;s recent &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973). &quot;The Guardian&quot; included it in its list of &quot;1000 albums to hear before you die&quot; and called it &quot;an efficacious antidote to the excesses of prog rock&quot;.

According to Sylvain, the album&#x27;s influence on punk can be attributed to how Rundgren recorded Sylvain&#x27;s guitar through the left speaker and Thunders&#x27; guitar on the right side, an orientation younger bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols subsequently adopted. Rundgren, on the other hand, was amused by how the record became considered a precursor to the punk movement: &quot;The irony is that I wound up producing the seminal punk album, but I was never really thought of as a punk producer, and I never got called by punk acts. They probably thought I was too expensive for what they were going for. But the Dolls didn&#x27;t really consider themselves punk.&quot; It was English singer Morrissey&#x27;s favorite album, and according to Paul Myers, the record &quot;struck such a chord with [him] that he was not only moved to form his own influential group, The Smiths ... but would eventually convince the surviving Dolls to reunite [in 2004]&quot;.
According to &quot;The Mojo Collection&quot; (2007), &quot;New York Dolls&quot; ignited punk rock and could still inspire more movements because of the music&#x27;s abundant attitude and passion, while &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; writer Colin Larkin deems it &quot;a major landmark in rock history, oozing attitude, vitality and controversy from every note&quot;. Writing for AllMusic, Erlewine – the website&#x27;s senior editor – claims that &quot;New York Dolls&quot; is a more quintessential proto-punk album than any of the Stooges&#x27; releases because of how it &quot;plunders history while celebrating it, creating a sleazy urban mythology along the way&quot;. David Fricke considers it to be a more definitive glam rock album than David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; (1972) or anything by Marc Bolan because of how the band &quot;captured both the glory and sorrow of glam, the high jinx and wasted youth, with electric photorealism&quot;. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Joe Gross calls it an &quot;absolutely essential&quot; record and &quot;epic sleaze, the sound of five young men shaping the big city in their own scuzzy image&quot;.

=== Professional rankings ===
&quot;New York Dolls&quot; appears frequently on professional listings of the greatest albums. In 1978, it was voted 199th in Paul Gambaccini&#x27;s book &quot;Rock Critics&#x27; Choice: The Top 200 Albums&quot;, which polled a number of leading music journalists and record collectors. Christgau, one of the critics polled, ranked it as the 15th best album of the 1970s in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; the following year – 11 spots behind the Dolls&#x27; second album &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot; (1974), although years later he would say the first album should be ranked ahead and was his favorite rock album. &quot;New York Dolls&quot; was included in Neil Strauss&#x27;s 1996 list of the 100 most influential alternative records, and the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995) named it the 70th best alternative album. In 2002, it was included on a list published by &quot;Q&quot; of the 100 best punk records, while &quot;Mojo&quot; named it both the 13th greatest punk album and the 49th greatest album of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the record at number 213 on its 500 greatest albums list in 2003 and &quot;Personality Crisis&quot; at number 271 on its 500 greatest songs list the following year. In 2007, &quot;Mojo&quot; polled a panel of prominent recording artists and songwriters for the magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Records That Changed the World&quot; publication, in which &quot;New York Dolls&quot; was voted the 39th most influential and inspirational record ever. In 2013, it placed at number 355 on &quot;NME&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

<text>Jacob Aaron Westervelt (January 20, 1800 – February 21, 1879) was a renowned and prolific shipbuilder who constructed 247 vessels of all descriptions during his career of over 50 years. From 1853 until 1855 he was Mayor of New York City.

Together with his partners (Westervelt &amp; MacKay and Westervelt &amp; Sons) he designed some of the fastest and most successful sailing packets, clippers and steamships ever built, among these the screw sloop and the clipper , as well as many vessels for foreign governments and Royal Houses. Westervelt was awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic by the Queen of Spain for the preparation of models and plans for three Spanish frigates. For many years he was the President of the Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, the Marine Society, the Port Society and the St. Nicholas Society. He was also President of the Board of Dock Commissioners for several years. After Westervelt&#x27;s death, the flags at City Hall were lowered to half-mast.

==Early life (1800–1817)==
Westervelt was the eldest son of Ari and Vrowti Westervelt. Ari Westervelt was a builder by occupation. He built several houses in Franklin Street, New York, and constructed the South Church in Schraalenburgh in today&#x27;s borough of Bergenfield, New Jersey . Westervelt was born in Tenafly, on January 20, 1800, and was baptized at Schraalenburgh on February 16, being the first child to receive that sacrament after the completion of the new church. The Westervelts then resided at the old family homestead on Tenafly Road midway between Englewood and Tenafly. When Ari Westervelt was working on improving the riverfront, he moved, together with his infant son, to New York in 1804, to be nearer his work. It was to his father that Jacob Aaron owed his good education. His father died when Westervelt was only 14.

The sources differ as to Westervelt&#x27;s further education and early career. He received additional education under the tutelage of James P. Forrester, then headmaster of the school connected with the Collegiate (Dutch) Church in New York, and was afforded greater educational opportunities under Barron &amp; Brown, in a special course on surveying and navigation. Afterwards he went to sea, serving on ships for more than two years. He left the sea in 1817 and became an apprentice under Christian Bergh, a prosperous shipbuilder on the East River. A differing source reports that he went to sea directly after his father&#x27;s death, while another states that he was already apprenticed to Christian Bergh in 1814.

==Christian Bergh&#x27;s shipyard (1817–1836)==
Westervelt learned the &quot;art, trade and mystery&quot; of his profession in a most independent way—as a teenage sailor and as an apprentice to Christian Bergh, for whom he worked at the very latest from the year 1817. Such was his talent that he was in Bergh&#x27;s absolute confidence. Before even graduating from his apprenticeship, Westervelt accepted an offer to start business in Charleston, where he undertook the construction of two schooners, with the help of African American slaves from planters in and around Charleston (with his employer&#x27;s consent). He was so successful during those few months that he continued in business there, but he found the environment too confining for his ambitions and in 1822 he returned to New York, where he formed a partnership with Robert Carnley and his old master under the name of C. Bergh &amp; Co. Some of the ships built by Bergh and Westervelt were &quot;Hope&quot; (1825), &quot;Henry IV&quot; (1826), &quot;Charlemagne&quot; (1828), &quot;Albany&quot; (1831), &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1832), &quot;Utica&quot; (1833), &quot;Westminster&quot; (1835), and &quot;Toronto&quot; (1835). Christian Bergh retired a wealthy man in 1837, and was succeeded by his sons Henry and Edwin Bergh, who continued the business until just after their father&#x27;s death in 1843.

==Westervelt &amp; Co. shipyard (1836–1864)==

In 1836 Westervelt built at least two ships under his own name, the &quot;Baltimore&quot; and &quot;Mediator&quot;, in partnership with the 22-year-old ship chandler Marshall Owen Roberts as Westervelt &amp; Roberts. Soon after Christian Bergh&#x27;s retirement, Westervelt and Robert Carnley made an extensive tour of Europe, visiting the principal shipbuilding points, where Westervelt gathered information that he subsequently put to good use. Westervelt found an inactive life disagreeable and, after a year of travel, returned to the dry docks in 1838 and resumed shipbuilding.

There are differing reports as to the start of this new chapter of Westervelt&#x27;s life. On one side it is stated that Westervelt bought out his former partners Carnley and the Bergh brothers and took control of the Bergh shipyard, at the foot of Gouverneur Street and extending to Water Street and up to Scammel. Other sources state that Westervelt and William MacKay (not to be confused with Canadian shipbuilder Donald McKay) established one of a few new yards at Corlear&#x27;s Hook (the block bounded by Third, Goerck and Houston Streets) in 1841 and moved to Lewis and Seventh Street in 1844. Westervelt may also have designed and built ships in connection with Edward Mills. 

The shipyard Westervelt &amp; MacKay, later Westervelt &amp; Sons (which Westervelt formed with his sons Aaron J. and Daniel), became prominent and prospered. Together with MacKay and his sons he built 50 steamships, 93 traditional sailing vessels and clippers, 5 barques, 14 schooners, one sloop, two lightships, and 11 pilot boats—a total of 181 vessels of 150,624 tons. 

Some of his noteworthy pilot boats are:
* Mary and Catherine (1848)
* Christian Bergh (1851)
* Enchantress (1851)
* &quot;George W. Blunt&quot; (1856)
* Edwin Forrest (1855)
* Abraham Leggett (1870)

Westervelt built more vessels of medium tonnage than any builder of his time. 

Some of his noteworthy sailing packets are:
*The &quot;Constellation&quot; (1849), built for the Robert Kermit Red Star Line—1,534 tons; 201 feet 10 inches x 41 feet x 28 feet (length x beam x depth of hold); 3 decks; draft 23 feet. This was the largest sailing vessel in the New York–Liverpool packet service at that time. The &quot;Constellation&quot; carried between 800 and 900 steerage passengers per passage on the lower deck (the 912 steerage passengers she discharged on 29 May 1851 was a record at the time).
*The and the &quot;Waterloo&quot; were among the fastest on the North Atlantic route. (Under the pressure of competition, packet schedules were tightened and sailings reorganized due to disasters, new launchings, etc. In 1844–1848, several ships made three-month round trips instead of the traditional four months, calculated from one Liverpool departure to the following one.)
*The , a packet sailing between New York and London on a regular schedule. She was built in 1846 in New York by Westervelt &amp; MacKay and owned by E. E. Morgan. The ship is renowned because of the sea shanty &quot;Clear the track&quot;, also called &quot;Clear the track, let the bullgine run&quot; or simply &quot;Margaret Evans&quot;.

===Clipper ships===
Westervelt also built clippers, for example &quot;Contest&quot; (1852), &quot;Hornet&quot; (1851), N.B. Palmer (1851), &quot;Kathay&quot; (1853), and . Clipper bows were distinctively narrow and heavily raked forward, allowing them to rapidly clip through the waves. The first archetypal clipper, with sharply raked stem, counter stern and square rig, was &quot;Ann McKim&quot;, built in Baltimore in 1833 by Kennard &amp; Williamson. For some historians, the &quot;Rainbow&quot; was the first true &quot;Yankee clipper&quot;. She was built in 1845 to a new design by the American naval architect John Willis Griffiths who is said to have based his design on the owner&#x27;s previous ship &quot;Ann McKim&quot;. This type of vessel had been in demand for the China trade, but they were rather small. From the experience gained in the service of these first clippers, the builder soon found the changes that were necessary in the design for the building of larger and faster ships demanded in 1850 for the California, China and Australia clipper routes.
====Westervelt&#x27;s clippers====
The greatest New York clippers took shape in the yards of Westervelt and his friend William H. Webb. The &quot;N.B. Palmer&quot; was perhaps the most famous clipper built in the Westervelt yard, besides the &quot;Sweepstakes&quot;. In China she was known as &quot;the Yacht&quot;, and with her nettings in the tops, brass guns, gold stripe, and her lavish entertainment on the Fourth of July and Washington&#x27;s Birthday, she well deserved the title. A full-rigged model of the &quot;N.B. Palmer&quot; was exhibited at The Crystal Palace, London, in 1851, and attracted much attention as a fine example of the American clipper ship. In 1858–1859 the &quot;N.B. Palmer&quot; with her 28-year-old Captain Hingham had tied the record of 82 days for the Shanghai to New York run. The &quot;Sweepstakes&quot;, though black-hulled like other clippers, bore a stripe of gold, found on only a few others like the &quot;N.B. Palmer&quot;, and was praised for her sleek lines and speed. &quot;Sweepstakes&quot; (which was the last clipper to be built by the Westervelt shipyard) gained celebrity for her record-breaking seventy-four-day run from New York to Bombay in 1857, and for making the trip between New York City and San Francisco in only 106 days.

====The end of the clipper ship era====

The economic boom spurred on by the California Gold Rush that had brought on the era of the clipper ships had turned to bust. All the secrets of building lofty clippers had been discovered and there were too many of them in existence. The dropping freight rates now gave no incentive to build any more. The San Francisco market was so saturated that many a disgusted ship captain dumped unwanted cargo overboard in the bay before sailing on to other ports. The diary of Robert Underhill, which recorded his 1856 travels on the &quot;Sweepstakes&quot;, revealed that Westervelt was also traveling on this voyage to San Francisco and the Orient. Underhill&#x27;s entries made clear that Westervelt recognized the economic situation facing the port of New York and was seeking other possible venues for the family business.

By 1859 most of the extreme clippers had been dismasted more than once after half a decade or more of relentless hard driving. All were in a leaky condition, and most of their owners were by then in dire financial straits and could not afford expensive repairs to clippers that could not find a paying cargo to justify such expenses. Their masts were cut down, their yards shortened and their sails reduced as they were refitted and re-rigged with the new Howes rig to make them easier to handle by smaller crews. Other less fortunate clippers were discarded outright and sold for a pittance.

===Steamboats and steamships===
Some historians take the view that Westervelt built the first true American steamship that crossed the Atlantic to Europe. The Marquis Claude de Jouffroy d&#x27;Abbans from France invented and constructed the first steamboat, the so-called &quot;Palmipède&quot;, in 1774, and a second one, the steamboat , in 1783. Robert Fulton built the first commercially successful steam paddleship in the US, the (also known as &quot;Clermont&quot;) in 1807, using a Boulton and Watt engine.

The is usually said to be the first steamship to cross the Atlantic (in 1819). She was originally planned as a sailing ship but was changed into a steamer. Because she did not make the entire passage under steam, some dispute the &quot;Savannah&quot;″s claim as the pioneering ocean steamer of the Atlantic. The British steamer &quot;City of Kingston&quot; and the , a Quebec-built craft, have been suggested as the first true steamers to make the crossing.

Three side-wheel steamers were also built in New York: the &quot;Lion&quot; and the &quot;Eagle&quot; (subsequently &quot;Regent&quot; and &quot;Congress&quot;), built in 1841 by Jacob Bell for the Spanish navy, and at about the same time the &quot;Kamschatka&quot; built by William H. Brown for the Russian navy. After the &quot;Savannah&quot;, there was no steamship owned or run by an American company that navigated the Atlantic Ocean to a port in Europe until 1847.

In 1846 began inquiries regarding the building of steamships for regularly scheduled transatlantic service. Edward Mills, a novice in the shipping business, led a syndicate that received the contract for mail delivery to Le Havre and Bremen for five years. With his associates C. H. Sand, Mortimer Livingston and John L. Stephens, he founded the Ocean Steam Navigation Company in May 1846. The company was unable to attract sufficient capital to carry out its original business plan to build four ships and instead ordered two ships from Westervelt &amp; MacKay, &quot;Washington&quot; and &quot;Hermann&quot; (1848). The Westervelt shipyard built the hull, and the engines were made by Stillman, Allen &amp; Co. This was one of the less successful chapters in the history of the Westervelt shipyard. Both paddle steamers were said to be slow and had insufficient cargo space, and the government soon revoked the Le Havre portion of the mail contract because of the line&#x27;s poor performance.

Westervelt and his associates later built very successful steamships. Through 1850 they built 8 of the 38 steamships constructed in New York until that year, including the &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Havre&quot; (the first steam vessels for the Havre Line), followed by and &quot;Rhode Island&quot; (for the government) and &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Morro Castle&quot; (for Spofford, Tileston &amp; Company). Westervelt &amp; Sons also built &quot;Foong Shuey&quot;, afterwards named &quot;Plymouth Rock&quot;, of 287 feet in length, with an engine from the Lake Erie steamer &quot;Plymouth Rock&quot;. This vessel made the voyage from New York to Singapore in 51 days. (The all-time record for a sailing vessel on that route is 78 days.) The SS Winfield Scott built in 1850 by Westervelt &amp; MacKay, wrecked on Middle Anacapa Island in 1853, and has been the object of numerous salvage operations since; she currently rests underwater as part of the Channel Islands National Park and Marine Sanctuary. The wreck site of the &quot;Winfield Scott&quot; is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Warships and ships for governments===

By 1855, the gold rush was over and Westervelt, like other shipbuilders, began looking for new markets to keep his yard busy, as the shipping lines that had carried almost 2.7 million emigrants across the Atlantic by sailing vessels between 1846 and 1855,were ordering fewer ships than before. The declining trend continued because of the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. Between 1855 and the end of the war in 1865, only 1.4 million emigrants were conveyed from Europe to the United States.

On March 3, 1857 the U.S. Congress authorized five screw sloops of war, one of them the (the first ship so named by the U.S. Navy). It was laid down later that year by Westervelt and his sons, launched in 1858, and commissioned on January 26, 1859 with Captain (later Admiral) David G. Farragut in command. USS &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was active in Caribbean operations until the start of the American Civil War. In 1861 she was an active participant in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America. She received orders for many different missions: she was one of the ships that attacked the Forts St. Philip and Jackson, and under the command of Captain James Alden, Jr. she was part of the fleet that helped to blockade Mobile Bay. During the battle of Mobile Bay, which lasted a little more than three hours, 54 of &quot;Brooklyn&quot;″s crew were killed and 43 wounded while firing 183 projectiles. After spending the next few weeks helping reduce the Confederate land works guarding the entrance, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; departed Mobile Bay on September 6, 1864 and headed for Hampton Roads for service in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Soon thereafter, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was in the task force that arrived off Fort Fisher on January 13, 1865, and her guns supported the attack until the fort surrendered on January 15. Since this victory completed the last major task of the Union Navy during the Civil War, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; sailed north and was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on January 31, 1865. Admiral Farragut declared &quot;Brooklyn&quot; to have been the most efficient man-of-war in the American navy.

Besides the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, also built at the Westervelt shipyard were the gunboats , and the revenue cutter , all of which performed efficient blockading services during the war. Westervelt also built many vessels for foreign governments, among these the frigate &quot;Hope&quot; in 1825 for the Greek government, &quot;Guadalquiver&quot; for Spain, and &quot;Eusiyama&quot; for Japan. Westervelt was awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic by the Queen of Spain for the preparation of models and plans for three Spanish frigates.

===Postwar slump and closure (1861–1868)===
The most successful year for Westervelts&#x27;s yard was 1858 when 12 ships were built (aggregating 14,081 tons). At the outbreak of the Civil War, Westervelt was one of the richest shipowners in the country. He was a supporter of the Union cause. President Abraham Lincoln esteemed his judgment highly, and entrusted him with the purchase of many of the river craft which were altered to suit the demands of blockading and transport service. Westervelt accepted nothing for such service, but contented himself with the profits accruing from his shipyard. It was during this period that his fortune shrank very much faster than it had been accumulated. Steamer after steamer was wrecked, burned or captured by Confederate cruisers, until at the close of the war he was almost bankrupt. During one year alone his losses from marine casualties amounted to $500,000.

After the end of the Civil War in 1865, the U.S. government auctioned off the hundreds of ships it had requisitioned during the war at firesale prices, depressing the market and leaving American shipyards with no work. The result was that most American shipyards, along with marine engine specialists, failed. Not only the Westervelt shipyard, but the whole shipbuilding industry in New York was badly affected by the slump, being practically wiped out in the ensuing years. As the demise of shipbuilding after the war afforded him little opportunity to recover from his losses, the firm was dissolved in 1868, with no large surplus of assets. By this time Westervelt had constructed 247 ships with his partners, more than any other American shipbuilder in his day.

==Dock Commissioner (1870–1879)==

When the Dock Department was created in 1870, Wilson G. Hunt prevailed upon Westervelt to accept the duties of Superintendent of the Department. His management was characterized by prudence, sagacity and honesty. When William Frederick Havemeyer became Mayor in 1873, Westervelt was appointed a Commissioner of Docks and at the same time elected President of the Board of Dock Commissioners (which position he also held at the time of his death), and as such made tremendous improvements in piers and docks. His chief engineer, whom he selected in July 1870, was General George B. McClellan, and his secretary General was Louis Fitzgerald. In 1875 George S. Greene Jr. became the new chief engineer.

As Dock Commissioner, Westervelt followed in the footsteps of his father by continuing to improve the riverfront.

In 1873 the draughtsmen and engineers in the office of the Engineer-in-Chief were engaged in the preparation of maps and drawings to show the grants of land under water, around, and adjoining the island of Manhattan which had been made by either the state or Municipal governments from 1696 till 1873. They were also engaged in the preparation of plans for a proposed exterior bulkhead wall which was planned to be built all around the city.

A new dock system was also proposed of which the main feature was a wide river street encircling the waterfront to afford ample accommodation for the movement of freight and its transportation by rail. The new river and sea wall was to be constructed of granite and a Beton concrete, composed of Portland cement and broken stone. From this wall projecting into the river were a series of piers constructed of wood, iron, and stone. The large concrete blocks used in the construction of the new river wall were manufactured at the yards of the Dock Commission in Gansevoort Street, Manhattan. Two to three blocks, of forty to fifty tons each, were made daily. Westervelt was closely involved in these improvements.

==Political career==
===Start in politics (1840–1852)===
Westervelt was politically an ardent but not very active Democrat. In 1840 he was elected to the Common Council, in which he served for two years as an Alderman from the thirteenth ward. Westervelt stepped back from active political involvement for a couple of years, but remained a shrewd observer of current affairs and recognized nuisances and the needs of the people of &quot;his&quot; town. He witnessed sharply increasing taxes between 1850 and 1852 and the establishment of a reform movement that began to decry excessive government spending. Grand jury revelations of widespread corruption on the common council heightened such concerns. Reformers mobilized and ran the Democratic incumbents out of office, electing in their place a combination of Whigs and reform Democrats committed to &quot;economy&quot; in government. In November 1852 Westervelt was nominated for Mayor of the city by reformist representatives of the Democratic party. The mayoralty election was held at the same time as the presidential election, and the Democrats were successful in both.

===Election as Mayor (1853–1855) and political goals===
Westervelt was elected by a majority of 10,000, the largest ever received by a candidate up to that time (being nearly as much indebted to Whigs as to Democrats for his seat), against the most popular member of the Whig party, Alderman Morgan Morgans, carrying his own ward by a majority of nearly 1,000, and only a few votes behind the electoral ticket for President Franklin Pierce. The new mayor inherited the bad financial situation of the city, corrupt politicians, and an ailing police system. In his first message to the Community Council he declared the subjects he planned to deal with first, and that according to him, needed the attention of the council:

===Mayor Westervelt and the police===

Westervelt&#x27;s term was marked by many reforms of the city&#x27;s police. One of the most controversial was his attempt to enforce a police uniform.

In 1844, New York City&#x27;s population of 320,000 was served by an archaic police force, consisting of one night watch, one hundred city marshals, thirty-one constables, and fifty-one municipal police officers. On 7 May 1844, the state legislature approved a proposal that authorized creation of a city police force, along with abolition of the nightwatch system. Under Mayor William Havemeyer, the NYPD was reorganized on May 13, 1845, with the city divided into three districts, with courts, magistrates, and clerks, and station houses. Within eight years this system showed weaknesses. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1853, &quot;Our police are inefficient. Worse has been said of them.&quot; Another publication delineated the situation much more precisely:

It was Mayor Westervelt&#x27;s stated aim to sort out the bad seed. In 1853 an administrative body was created, called the Board of Police Commissioners, consisting of Mayor Westervelt, the recorder and the city judge. Apart from the fact that the chief of police was selected by the Mayor with the Board&#x27;s approval, the Board had full powers of appointment and dismissal of all members of the force and was charged with general administrative duties.

In nothing was the undisciplined attitude of the police more clearly shown than in their refusal to wear uniforms. &quot;Un-American&quot;, &quot;undemocratic&quot;, &quot;militarism&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s livery&quot;, &quot;a badge of degradation and servitude&quot;—ideas of this kind formed the basis of opposition against Westervelt&#x27;s wish to put policemen in uniform, mainly from the force itself and an influential number of citizens who deemed it &quot;unrepublican&quot; to put the servants of the city in livery. On June 24, 1854 there was a large, angry meeting of 1,000–1,500 policemen. The objects of the meeting were stated in a notice posted prominently in the streets and published in the morning papers:

Westervelt&#x27;s position was clear: that a uniform incites a high degree of chivalrous sentiment, that it involves a &quot;pride of cloth&quot;, and that the wearer knows that if he disgraces it he disgraces himself and the profession in which he serves. Westervelt earned many party enemies by his determined policy to keep appointments to the police force, which were then a large part of the patronage appertaining to the mayoralty, free from political influence.

===Mayor Westervelt&#x27;s influence on tourism===

By the early 1850s New York had grown to sufficient size and prominence that the city decided to host a major exhibition of the type that London had pioneered in 1851. Such early exhibitions were forerunners of the later world&#x27;s fairs. The Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations opened during the term of Mayor Westervelt on July 14, 1853, in a sparsely developed part of the city. Fortieth and Forty-second streets bounded the fair&#x27;s four-acre site to the immediate west of the Croton Distributing Reservoir—today&#x27;s Bryant Park. Within New York&#x27;s Crystal Palace, designed by Karl Gildemeister, four thousand exhibitors displayed the industrial wares, consumer goods, and artworks of the nation. Westervelt was President of the Exhibition, which set off one of the first major tourism booms in New York; many hotels were built to handle the influx of visitors. Over one million people visited the Crystal Palace Exhibition, which closed on November 1, 1854 (in spite of its popularity, the exhibition&#x27;s sponsors lost $300,000 on the venture). The structure remained standing after the fair, and was leased for a variety of purposes before being destroyed by fire on October 5, 1858.

===Controversial opinions===

====Proposed reduction of Central Park====
Mayor Westervelt did not shy away from unpopular decisions if he considered them to serve the general good. In 1853 the New York legislature designated a area from 59th to 106th Streets for the creation of the planned Central Park, though the land alone cost over $5 million. At the time, the city&#x27;s finances were declining, and Westervelt was concerned about overspending and the state&#x27;s regulatory overreach in its decision to designate such a large area. There were several competing proposals to curtail the park, but no decision was made until March 1855, when the city&#x27;s board of councilmen voted 14-to-3 to trim both the lower thirteen blocks (from 59th to 72nd Streets) and four hundred feet from each side of Central Park. However, on March 23, 1855, the new Democratic Mayor, Fernando Wood, vetoed the measure.

====Riots====
The New York Draft Riots, the worst riots in United States history with respect to lives lost, took place during the Civil War in 1863, when immigrant factory workers forcibly resisted the federal government&#x27;s military draft. In the United States, the period from 1820 to 1870 was generally characterized by conflicts on the domestic front, such as the police riots and the riots of the Know-Nothing movement. It was during Westervelt&#x27;s term as mayor that some of the first Know-Nothing riots occurred. This nativist American political movement was empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by Irish Catholic immigrants, who were often regarded as hostile to American values and controlled by the Pope in Rome. This body of thought was often propagated by street preachers. One of the most ambivalent characters was Reverend Mr. Parsons, who had been in the habit of regularly preaching on the wharves, in shipyards and other &quot;obscure&quot; places along the East and North Rivers. On December 11, 1853 he planted himself upon a pile of timber in the Westervelt &amp; MacKay shipyard. His voice traveled far, and in the course of half an hour there was an assemblage of some ten thousand people. As a result of his speech a serious riot occurred and on the orders of Mayor Westervelt the preacher was taken into custody. Some Know-Nothinger hastened to the station house with the intention of liberating him. Finding no redress there, five thousand excited men marched to 308 East Broadway and surrounded the residence of Mayor Westervelt. Finding that he was absent from home, they contented themselves with daubing a large cross on the door.

The feelings of the members of this movement against the participation of foreign-born citizens in municipal affairs had grown very bitter, and Westervelt set himself so sternly against them that his house was mobbed again. Probably due to the paucity of support for his reformist efforts during his term, but also because he applied himself more and more to the business of shipbuilding again, Westervelt declined a renomination, which for him was equivalent to an election, and was succeeded as Mayor by Fernando Wood. In 1857 Westervelt became a member of the New York State Assembly for Rockland County.

==Genealogy of the Westervelt family==
===Ancestors===
Westervelt, as his name indicates, came from old Dutch stock. The name was known in the Netherlands at a very early period, and although the family members were not of nobility, they had been extensive property owners for many generations. The earliest mention of the Westervelts that has been recorded is of a Dirk van Westervelt and his family who resided in and around the town of Harderwijk for many years. Some individuals sharing that name appear to have been early inhabitants of Zwolle, and their descendants are still to be found there, known by the name Westerveld.

In the middle of the 17th century a few Westervelts lived in Meppel, situated a few miles from the eastern shore of the Zuiderzee, in the province of Drenthe and three miles east of Zwolle. Amongst them were two brothers, Willem and Lubbert Lubbertsen van Westervelt, both farmers and cattle raisers, who with their wives and children decided to move to the New World. They left Amsterdam on board (&quot;Hope&quot;) on April 8, 1662. On their arrival on May 24, 1662, New Amsterdam (which later became New York City) was suffering from a prolonged drought as no rain had fallen for eighty consecutive days. Lubbert settled near Hackensack, New Jersey and was one of the promoters of the Dutch Church organized there in 1686. Willem was a member of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church in New Amsterdam (1667), whilst his son lived at New Utrecht on Long Island. This son sold his lands in 1706 and is supposed to have moved to New Jersey, where the family has been numerous and prominent for the past 300 years. William Lubbertsen van Westervelt with his wife and six children, and Lubbert Lubbertsen van Westervelt, with his wife and four children, became the progenitors of the &quot;van Westervelt/Westervelt&quot; family in America, and were at one time the second largest family in Bergen County, New Jersey. Jacob Aaron Westervelt was a seventh-generation descendant of Lubbert Lubbertsen van Westervelt.

<text>The Eurasian magpie or common magpie (Pica pica) is a resident breeding bird throughout the northern part of the Eurasian continent. It is one of several birds in the crow family (corvids) designated magpies, and belongs to the Holarctic radiation of &quot;monochrome&quot; magpies. In Europe, &quot;magpie&quot; is used by English speakers as a synonym for the Eurasian magpie: the only other magpie in Europe is the Iberian magpie (&quot;Cyanopica cooki&quot;), which is limited to the Iberian Peninsula. Despite having a shared name and similar colouration, it is not closely related to the Australian magpie.

The Eurasian magpie is one of the most intelligent birds. The expansion of its nidopallium is approximately the same in its relative size as the brain of chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and humans. It is the only non-mammalian species known to pass the mirror test.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The magpie was described and illustrated by Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in his &quot;Historiae animalium&quot; of 1555. In 1758, Linnaeus included the species in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Corvus pica&quot;. The magpie was moved to a separate genus &quot;Pica&quot; by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. &quot;Pica&quot; is the Classical Latin word for this magpie.

The Eurasian magpie is almost identical in appearance to the North American black-billed magpie (&quot;Pica hudsonia&quot;) and at one time the two species were considered to be conspecific. The English name used was &quot;black-billed magpie&quot; and the scientific name used was &quot;Pica pica&quot;. In 2000, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union decided to treat the black-billed magpie as a separate species based on studies of the vocalization and behaviour that indicated that the black-billed magpie was closer to the yellow-billed magpie (&quot;Pica nuttalli&quot;) than to the Eurasian magpie.

The gradual clinal variation over the large geographic range and the intergradation of the different subspecies means that the geographical limits, and acceptance of the various subspecies, vary between authorities. The International Ornithological Congress recognises six subspecies (a seventh, &quot;P. p. hemileucoptera&quot;, is included in &quot;P. p. bactriana&quot;):
* &quot;P. p. fennorum&quot; – : northern Scandinavia and northwest Russia
* &quot;P. p. pica&quot; – : British Isles and southern Scandinavia east to Russia, south to Mediterranean, including most islands
* &quot;P. p. melanotos&quot; – : Iberian Peninsula
* &quot;P. p. bactriana&quot; – : Siberia east to Lake Baikal, south to Caucasus, Iraq, Iran, Central Asia and Pakistan
* &quot;P. p. leucoptera&quot; – : southeast Russia and northeast China
* &quot;P. p. camtschatica&quot; – : northern Sea of Okhotsk, and Kamchatka Peninsula in Russian Far East

Others now considered as distinct species:
* &quot;P. mauritanica&quot; – : North Africa (Morocco, northern Algeria and Tunisia) (now considered a separate species, the Maghreb magpie)
* &quot;P. asirensis&quot; – : southwest Saudi Arabia (now considered a separate species, the Asir magpie)
* &quot;P. serica&quot; – : east and south China, Taiwan, north Myanmar, north Laos and north Vietnam (now considered a separate species, the Oriental magpie)
* &quot;P. bottanensis&quot; – : west central China (now considered a separate species, the black-rumped magpie)

A study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found that magpies in eastern and northeastern China are genetically very similar to each other, but differ from those in northwestern China and Spain.

===Etymology===
Magpies were originally known as simply &quot;pies&quot;. This is hypothesized to derive from a Proto-Indo-European root *(s)peyk- meaning &quot;pointed&quot;, in reference to the beak or perhaps the tail (cf. woodpecker). The prefix &quot;mag&quot; dates from the 16th century and comes from the short form of the given name Margaret, which was once used to mean women in general (as Joe or Jack is used for men today); the pie&#x27;s call was considered to sound like the idle chattering of a woman, and so it came to be called the &quot;Mag pie&quot;. &quot;Pie&quot; as a term for the bird dates to the 13th century, and the word &quot;pied&quot;, first recorded in 1552, became applied to other birds that resembled the magpie in having black-and-white plumage.

==Description==
The adult male of the nominate subspecies, &quot;P. p. pica&quot;, is in length, of which more than half is the tail. The wingspan is . The head, neck, breast and vent are glossy black with a metallic green and violet sheen; the belly and scapulars (shoulder feathers) are pure white; the wings are black glossed with green or purple, and the primaries have white inner webs, conspicuous when the wing is open. The graduated tail is black, glossed with green and reddish purple. The legs and bill are black; the iris is dark brown. The rump is black with white stripe above which varies in thickness between subspecies. The plumage of the sexes is similar but females are slightly smaller. The tail feathers of both sexes are quite long, about 12–28 cm long. Males of the nominate subspecies weigh while females weigh . The young resemble the adults, but are at first without much of the gloss on the sooty plumage. The young have the malar region pink, and somewhat clear eyes. The tail is much shorter than the adults.

The subspecies differ in their size, the amount of white on their plumage and the colour of the gloss on their black feathers. The Asian subspecies &quot;P. p. bactriana&quot; has more extensive white on the primaries and a prominent white rump.

Adults undergo an annual complete moult after breeding. Moult begins in June or July and ends in September or October. The primary flight feathers are replaced over a period of three months. Juvenile birds undergo a partial moult beginning about one month later than the adult birds in which their body feathers are replaced but not those of the wings or the tail.

Eurasian magpies have a well-known call. It is a choking chatter &quot;chac-chac&quot; or a repetitive &quot;chac-chac-chac-chac&quot;. The young also emit the previous call, although they also emit an acute call similar to a &quot;Uik Uik&quot;, which may resemble the barking of a small dog. Both adults and young can emit a kind of hiss barely noticeable from afar.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the magpie extends across temperate Eurasia from Portugal, Spain and Ireland in the west to the Kamchatka Peninsula.

The preferred habit is open countryside with scattered trees and magpies are normally absent from treeless areas and dense forests. They sometimes breed at high densities in suburban settings such as parks and gardens. They can often be found close to the centre of cities.

Magpies are normally sedentary and spend winters close to their nesting territories but birds living near the northern limit of their range in Sweden, Finland and Russia can move south in harsh weather.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===

Some magpies breed after their first year, while others remain in the non-breeding flocks and first breed in their second year. They are monogamous, and the pairs often remain together from one breeding season to the next. They generally occupy the same territory on successive years.

Mating takes place in spring. In the courtship display, males rapidly raise and depress their head feathers, uplift, open and close their tails like fans, and call in soft tones quite distinct from their usual chatter. The loose feathers of the flanks are brought over the primaries, and the shoulder patch is spread so the white is conspicuous, presumably to attract females. Short buoyant flights and chases follow.

Magpies prefer tall trees for their bulky nest, firmly attaching them to a central fork in the upper branches. A framework of the sticks is cemented with earth and clay, and a lining of the same is covered with fine roots. Above is a stout though loosely built dome of prickly branches with a single well-concealed entrance. These huge nests are conspicuous when the leaves fall. Where trees are scarce, though even in well-wooded country, nests are at times built in bushes and hedgerows.

In Europe, clutches are typically laid in April, and usually contain five or six eggs, but clutches with as few as three and as many as ten have been recorded. The eggs are laid in early morning, usually at daily intervals. On average, the eggs of the nominate species measure and weigh . Small for the size of the bird, they are typically pale blue-green, with close specks and spots of olive brown, but show much variation in ground and marking.

The eggs are incubated for 21–22 days by the female, who is fed on the nest by the male. The chicks are altricial, hatching nearly naked with closed eyes. They are brooded by the female for the first 5–10 days and fed by both parents. Initially the parents eat the faecal sacs of the nestlings, but as the chicks grow larger, they defecate on the edge of the nest. The nestlings open their eyes 7 to 8 days after hatching. Their body feathers start to appear after around 8 days and the primary wing feathers after 10 days. For several days before they are ready to leave the nest, the chicks clamber around the nearby branches. They fledge at around 27 days. The parents then continue to feed the chicks for several more weeks. They also protect the chicks from predators, as their ability to fly is poor, making them vulnerable. On average, only 3 or 4 chicks survive to fledge successfully. Some nests are lost to predators, but an important factor causing nestling mortality is starvation. Magpie eggs hatch asynchronously, and if the parents have difficulty finding sufficient food, the last chicks to hatch are unlikely to survive. Only a single brood is reared, unless disaster overtakes the first clutch.

A study conducted near Sheffield in Britain, using birds with coloured rings on their legs, found that only 22% of fledglings survived their first year. For subsequent years, the survival rate for the adult birds was 69%, implying that for those birds that survive the first year, the average total lifespan was 3.7 years. The maximum age recorded for a magpie is 21 years and 8 months for a bird from near Coventry in England that was ringed in 1925 and shot in 1947.
===Feeding===
The magpie is omnivorous, eating young birds and eggs, small mammals, insects, scraps and carrion, acorns, grain, and other vegetable substances.

=== Intelligence ===
Along with other corvids such as ravens, western jackdaws and crows, the Eurasian magpie is believed to be not only among the most intelligent of birds, but also among the most intelligent of all animals. The Eurasian magpie&#x27;s nidopallium is approximately the same relative size as those in chimpanzees and humans, and significantly larger than those of the gibbons. Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to most great apes and cetaceans. A 2004 review suggests that the intelligence of the corvid family to which the Eurasian magpie belongs is equivalent to that of the great apes (bonobos, gorillas and orangutans) in terms of social cognition, causal reasoning, flexibility, imagination and prospection.

Magpies have been observed engaging in elaborate social rituals, possibly including the expression of grief. Mirror self-recognition has been demonstrated in European magpies, making them one of only a few species known to possess this capability. The cognitive abilities of the Eurasian magpie are regarded as evidence that intelligence evolved independently in both corvids and primates. This is indicated by tool use, an ability to hide and store food across seasons, episodic memory, and using their own experience to predict the behavior of conspecifics. Another behaviour exhibiting intelligence is cutting their food in correctly sized proportions for the size of their young. In captivity, magpies have been observed counting up to get food, imitating human voices, and regularly using tools to clean their own cages. In the wild, they organise themselves into gangs and use complex strategies hunting other birds and when confronted by predators.

==Status==
The Eurasian magpie has an extremely large range. The European population is estimated to be between 7.5 and 19 million breeding pairs. Allowing for the birds breeding in other continents, the total population is estimated to be between 46 and 228 million individuals. The population trend in Europe has been stable since 1980. There is no evidence of any serious overall decline in numbers, so the species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.

==Relationship with humans==

===Traditions, symbolism, and reputation===

====Europe====
In Europe, magpies have been historically demonized by humans, mainly as a result of superstition and myth. The bird has found itself in this situation mainly by association, says Steve Roud: &quot;Large black birds, like crows and ravens, are viewed as evil in British folklore and white birds are viewed as good&quot;. In European folklore, the magpie is associated with a number of superstitions surrounding its reputation as an omen of ill fortune. In the 19th century book, &quot;A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar&quot;, a proverb concerning magpies is recited: &quot;A single magpie in spring, foul weather will bring&quot;. The book further explains that this superstition arises from the habits of pairs of magpies to forage together only when the weather is fine. In Scotland, a magpie near the window of the house is said to foretell death. An English tradition holds that a single magpie be greeted with a salutation in order to ward off the bad luck it may bring. A greeting might be something like &quot;Good morning, Mr Magpie, how are Mrs Magpie and all the other little magpies?&quot;, and a 19th century version recorded in Shropshire is to say &quot;Devil, Devil, I defy thee! Magpie, magpie, I go by thee!&quot; and to spit on the ground three times.

In Britain and Ireland, a widespread traditional rhyme, &quot;One for Sorrow&quot;, records the myth (it is not clear whether it has been seriously believed) that seeing magpies predicts the future, depending on how many are seen. There are many regional variations on the rhyme, which means that it is impossible to give a definitive version.

In Italian, British and French folklore, magpies are believed to have a penchant for picking up shiny items, particularly precious stones or metal objects. Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;La gazza ladra&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; are based on this theme. However, one recent research study has cast doubt on the veracity of this belief. In Bulgarian, Czech, German, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, Slovak and Swedish folklore the magpie is seen as a thief. In Hungary there is an old saying which said when you heard a magpie singing it meant guests would be coming to your house. Perhaps because the magpie loved to sit on the trees in front of the village houses and signaled when a man was approaching.

In Sweden, it is further associated with witchcraft. In Norway, a magpie is considered cunning and thievish, but also the bird of hulder, the underground people.

Magpies have been attacked for their role as predators, which includes eating other birds&#x27; eggs and their young, mostly smaller songbirds. However, one study has disputed the view that they affect total song-bird populations, finding &quot;no evidence of any effects of [magpie] predator species on songbird population growth rates. We therefore had no indication that predators had a general effect on songbird population growth rates&quot;. Another study has claimed that smaller songbird populations increased in places where magpie populations were high and that they do not have a negative impact on the total songbird population.

<text>Life After Death is the second studio album by American rapper the Notorious B.I.G., released on March 25, 1997, on Bad Boy Records and Arista Records. A double album, it was released sixteen days after his murder. It features collaborations with guest artists such as 112, Jay-Z, Lil&#x27; Kim, Mase, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Too Short, Angela Winbush, Darryl McDaniels of Run-DMC, R. Kelly, the Lox, and Puff Daddy. &quot;Life After Death&quot; exhibits the Notorious B.I.G. further delving into the mafioso rap subgenre. The album is a sequel to his first album, &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, and picks up where the last song, &quot;Suicidal Thoughts&quot;, ends.

&quot;Life After Death&quot; sold 690,000 copies in its first week, peaking at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It received widespread critical acclaim upon release and was nominated for Best Rap Album, Best Rap Solo Performance for its first single &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for its second single &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot; at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards. The album is widely considered to be one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. In 2020, it was ranked at No. 179 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

== Background ==
Two and a half years before the album&#x27;s release, the Notorious B.I.G., who had married Faith Evans, became East Coast&#x27;s icon in the East CoastWest Coast rivalry and featured on albums by Michael Jackson and R. Kelly amongst others. The album had numerous planned release dates, but Biggie was involved in a car accident in September 1996 that delayed the finalizing of the album. It was pushed back to 1997.

As he explained on BET&#x27;s Rap City, Biggie aimed to reach a wider audience with &quot;Life After Death&quot;, collaborating with a wider variety of artists than on his debut. In addition to Bad Boy labelmates Mase, the LOX and 112, and label owner Puff Daddy, guests include Jay-Z, Angela Winbush, Too Short, Lil Kim, and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. A record with Bay Area rapper E-40 was not included on the final track listing.

Production was handled by DJ Premier, Easy Mo Bee, Havoc, Buckwild, RZA, Clark Kent and members of Bad Boy&#x27;s in-house production team, the Hitmen. Q-Tip submitted a beat, which Biggie enjoyed; however, the album had already been completed and turned into Bad Boy. The beat was later used for A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s song &quot;The Love&quot;, from their 1998 album &quot;The Love Movement&quot;.

Biggie traveled to the West Coast in February 1997 to promote the album, and shoot the video for the lead single, &quot;Hypnotize.&quot; Two weeks before its release, on March 9, he was shot four times in a drive-by shooting and later pronounced dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Life After Death&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics upon release. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the album as &quot;flaunting affluence with a leisurely swagger, midtempo grooves and calmly arrogant raps&quot;. Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called it a &quot;conscious continuation of &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, and stated &quot;Life After Death&quot; captures crime&#x27;s undeniable glamour but doesn&#x27;t stint on the fear, desperation and irretrievable loss that the streets inevitably exact&quot;. Cheo Hodari Coker from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Life After Death&quot; reflects both the dark and the heartfelt sides of the rapper&#x27;s Gemini personality. It&#x27;s not only a complex testament to who he was in his private life, but also a demonstration of his amazing rhyming ability. In key moments, B.I.G. does a marvelous job of surfing between accessible music fare tailored for the radio, and more challenging material that will be savored by hard-core rap fans who have long admired B.I.G.&#x27;s microphone skills. Rarely has a rapper attempted to please so many different audiences and done it so brilliantly&quot;. In a five-mic review for &quot;The Source&quot;, Michael A. Gonzales felt that it would &quot;undoubtedly become a classic to any true hip-hop fan&quot;. Although David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was unfavorable of the album&#x27;s long length, and some of its violent and materialistic content, he commended Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;bicoastal respect&quot; by working with other hip-hop styles and artists from other regions of the United States.

=== Retrospect ===
Since its release, &quot;Life After Death&quot; has received retrospective acclaim from critics. Rob Sheffield, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), called it &quot;a filler-free two-disc rush of musical bravado&quot; and commented that the Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s voice and lyrics were &quot;deeper&quot; than before. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier wrote, &quot;It may have taken the Notorious B.I.G. a few years to follow up his milestone debut, &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, with another album, but when he did return with &quot;Life After Death&quot;, he did so in a huge way. The ambitious album, intended as somewhat of a sequel to &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, picked up where its predecessor left off.&quot; Birchmeier further said, &quot;Over the course of only two albums, he achieved every success imaginable, perhaps none greater than this unabashedly over-reaching success.&quot; Evan McGarvey of &quot;Stylus&quot; magazine wrote in his review, &quot;&quot;Life After Death&quot; is a grand exercise in personal mythology, narrative sweep, and truly diverse, universal pop excellence. As a double album it is the very definition of cinematic; it essentially perfected the concept and standard in hip-hop ... Sequenced as an unpacking of sorts, the album&#x27;s progression from song to song is an essay itself.&quot; In 2013, &quot;VIBE&quot; named &quot;Life After Death&quot; the greatest Hip-Hop/R&amp;B album since 1993.

=== Accolades ===


== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Life After Death&quot; was released to a significant amount of critical praise and commercial success. The album sold 690,000 copies in its first week. In 2000, the album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipment of 10 million copies (the threshold for double albums) and it has been credited as one of the best-selling rap albums of all time. It also made the largest jump to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in history, jumping from number 176 to number one in one week. Also, it spent four weeks at number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and topped the Billboard Year-End chart as a &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 1997.

It spent its four consecutive weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 from the weeks of April 12 to May 3, 1997, later being bombarded from the top entry by singer Mary J. Blige&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Share My World&quot;, which released on April 22.

== Legacy and influence ==

Although released in the wake of B.I.G.&#x27;s fatal shooting, &quot;Life After Death&quot; signaled a stylistic change in gangsta rap as it crossed to the commercial mainstream. After &quot;Life After Death&quot;, Puff Daddy&#x27;s Bad Boy Records continued to bring pop and gangsta rap closer together: the references to violence and drug dealing remained, as did the &quot;gangsta&quot; rhetoric, but the previously dark production changed to a cleaner, sample-heavy, more upbeat sound that was fashioned for the pop charts, as seen in the single &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot;. The Notorious B.I.G. is often credited with initiating this transition, as he was among the first mainstream rappers to produce albums with a calculated attempt to include both gritty and realistic gangsta narratives as well as radio-friendly productions.

The majority of the album was produced by Steven &quot;Stevie J&quot; Jordan, Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot; Angelettie, Carlos &quot;July Six&quot; Broady, Ron Lawrence, and Nashiem Myrick. However, notable hip-hop producers such as Easy Mo Bee, DJ Premier, Havoc from Mobb Deep, and RZA from Wu-Tang Clan contributed beats.

Various artists were specifically influenced by songs on &quot;Life After Death&quot;. Evidence&#x27;s &quot;Down in New York City&quot; is essentially &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot; from the perspective of a West Coast hip hop artist. Jay-Z borrows four bars from &quot;The World Is Filled...&quot; in his song &quot;I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)&quot;, as well as the chorus from his song &quot;Squeeze first&quot; from &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, a line in &quot;The Ruler&#x27;s Back&quot; from &quot;Kick in the Door&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Nobody (&#x27;Til Somebody Kills You)&quot; on &quot;D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)&quot;. Ice Cube borrows the chorus from &quot;Kick in the Door&quot; for his song &quot;Child Support&quot;. As with B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;I Love the Dough&quot; Monica&#x27;s 2010 song &quot;Everything to Me&quot; samples &quot;I Love You More&quot; by René &amp; Angela. The official remix includes a verse from B.I.G. that originally appeared on &quot;I Love the Dough&quot;. SWV sampled &quot;Ten Crack Commandments&quot; on the opening track &quot;Someone&quot; featuring B.I.G.&#x27;s former protege and friend Puff Daddy. The French rapper Rohff named his album &quot;La Vie Avant La Mort&quot; (Life Before Death) (2001) as a tribute to B.I.G, Joey Badass interpolated the lines &#x27;Kick in the Door&#x27; on &quot;Super Predator&quot; from &quot;All-Amerikkkan Badass&quot; (2017).

<text>Michoacán, formally Michoacán de Ocampo, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Michoacán de Ocampo, is one of the 31 states which, together with Mexico City, compose the Federal Entities of Mexico. The state is divided into 113 municipalities and its capital city is Morelia (formerly called Valladolid). The city was named after José María Morelos, a native of the city and one of the main heroes of the Mexican War of Independence.

Michoacán is located in western Mexico, and has a stretch of coastline on the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. It is bordered by the states of Colima and Jalisco to the west and northwest, Guanajuato to the north, Querétaro to the northeast, the State of México to the east, and Guerrero to the southeast.

The name Michoacán is from Nahuatl: &quot;Michhuahcān&quot; from &quot;michhuah&quot; and &quot;-cān&quot; and means &quot;place of the fishermen&quot;, referring to those who fish on Lake Pátzcuaro. In pre-Hispanic times, the area was the home of the Purépecha Empire, which rivaled the Aztec Empire at the time of Spanish encounter. After the Spanish conquest, the empire became a separate province which became smaller over the colonial period. The state and its residents played a major role in the Mexican War of Independence.

Today, the state is still home to a sizable population of Purépecha people as well as minor populations of Otomi and Nahua. 
The economy is based on agriculture, ranching, fishing, mining, and the arts. The major tourism draw for the state is the Lake Pátzcuaro–Tzintzuntzan–Quiroga area, which was the center of the Purépecha Empire; as well as the location of the Tzintzuntzan yácata pyramids. The national and state parks which include the winter grounds of the monarch butterflies &quot;(Mariposas Monarca)&quot; are located here. Michoacán is known for its Spanish colonial towns. In 1991, Morelia was declared an UNESCO World Heritage Site for its well-preserved colonial buildings, pink stone cathedral, historic center, and aqueduct. Michoacán has eight &quot;Pueblos Mágicos&quot;; such as the towns of Tlalpujahua and Santa Clara del Cobre.

Day of the Dead celebrations in some parts of Michoacán, such as the towns of Janitzio and Pátzcuaro, are often considered to be the most elaborate and famous in all of Mexico. The famous Parícutin volcano, which is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, is located near the city of Uruapan. The state is known as &quot;the soul of Mexico&quot;.
==History==

According to archaeological evidence, there has been human habitation within the territory of the Mexican state of Michoacán for at least 10,000 years. In the pre-Hispanic period, there were waves of migration into the area, including the Pirinda, Nahua, Huetamo, Colima, Purépecha and other peoples. There are sites of formal settlements from all Mesoamerican periods. Important sites include El Opeño and those in Curutarán, Tepalcatepec, Apatzingán, Zinapécuaro and Coalcomán. The territory has been inhabited by the Nahua, Otomi, Matlatzinca, Pirinda and Teco peoples as well as the Purépecha.

The main pre-Hispanic civilization of the state is that of the Purépecha, which was centered in the Lake Pátzcuaro area. Before the 13th century, both Nahua and Purépecha peoples were here, sustaining themselves by agriculture and fishing. The Purépecha are descendants of a late arrival of Chichimeca who came from the north. At Lake Patzcuaro, they came upon people with similar cultures to their own but who were more technological and socially advanced. The formation of the Purépechan state in the 13th century, when these people started their own dominion at Uayameo, today Santa Fé de la Laguna, and becoming dominant over the entire Lake Patzcuaro area by the 15th century. Conquest of neighboring tribes and territories occurred between 1401 and 1450, as they absorbed peoples with different cultures and languages into the empire. By the late 15th century, this state rivaled that of the Aztecs, having expanded their territory over much of what is now Michoacán and into part of Colima, Nayarit, Querétaro, Guanajuato, Guerrero and Jalisco. The Aztecs attempted to invade the Purépecha but were repelled. Because of this attack, the Purépecha later denied the Aztecs aid in their defense of Tenochtitlan against the Spanish and the Tlaxcala. The Purépechas are noted by historians to be one of the few rare instances in the Americas were the indigenous people had some experience with metallurgy prior to the arrival of the Europeans, especially coppersmithing and other metal ores located in their empire. Their descendants are still widely regarded for this today.

Prior to the arrival of any Spaniard in the territory, then-ruler Zuanga died of smallpox, presumably carried by one of the Aztec delegations seeking military aid. He was succeeded by Tanganxoan II. The first Spaniard to the area was Cristóbal de Olid. The Spanish destruction of Tenochtitlan and their promise to allow him to remain ruler convinced Tanganxoan II to submit to Spanish rule. But, Nuño de Guzmán reneged on this agreement and killed Tanganxoan II in 1530, a crime for which he was tried and exiled to Spain where he would die in prison.

During the first years of the Conquest, Michoacán was part of the &quot;kingdom of Mexico&quot; which included the current states of Mexico, Querétaro, Hidalgo, Tlaxcala, Oaxaca, Morelos, Guerrero, Veracruz, Tabasco, Michoacán, Guanajuato and parts of San Luis Potosí, Jalisco and Colima. These lands were divided into encomiendas among the conquistadors. The provinces with the largest populations were called Alcaldias Mayores, with Michoacán being one of these, with its capital initially at Tzintzuntzan. Soon after, it was moved to Patzcuaro and eventually settled in what is now Morelia. The provincial and later state capital was founded by viceroy Antonio de Mendoza in 1541. It became the political and ecclesiastical center of the province after the death of Vasco de Quiroga in 1565.

Soon after the Spanish Conquest, evangelists from the Franciscan, Augustinian, Carmelite and other orders established monasteries all over the territory. Some of the best-known are Juan de Moya, Martín de la Coruña and Jacob the Dacian. As first governor, Nuño de Guzmán disrupted and devastated the social and economic order of the area. Vasco de Quiroga succeeded Guzman, bringing Franciscan and Augustinian friars to both evangelize and repair the area&#x27;s broken economy and social institutions. Quiroga founded the Spanish city of Patzcuaro in 1538, calling it the Ciudad de Mechuacán. For his efforts, Quiroga is still referred to in the Patzcuaro area as &quot;Tata (grandfather) Vasco&quot;. The diocese of Michoacán was established in 1536 by Pope Paul III, and its boundaries coincide with the old Purépecha kingdom. Its first bishop was Vasco de Quiroga.

The Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo began as the Colegio de San Nicolas Obispo, founded by Vasco de Quiroga in Patzcuaro in 1540. It was originally a seminary for the training of evangelists. It was granted a royal seal in 1543 to become the Real Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo. The school was moved to Morelia in 1580 and was fused with the Colegio de San Miguel Guayangareo. In 1590, its name was changed to the Seminario Tridentino, afterwards to Seminario Conciliar in 1601. By the end of the 17th century, the name returned to Colegio de San Nicolás but its structure was profoundly changed, adding studies such as philosophy, civil law, and others. At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, a number of figures associated with the Mexican War of Independence, such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, José María Morelos and others were associated with this school. By the mid-19th century, the school had been secularized and renamed the Primitivo y Nacional Colegio de San Nicolás de Hidalgo adding studies such as chemistry, physics and other sciences. The current name and organization was adopted after the Mexican Revolution in 1917.
From the 16th to the 18th centuries, Augustinian, Franciscan and Carmelite missions were constructed in the territory as well as civil constructions, especially in the city now known as Morelia. Mining in areas such as Angangueo, Tlalpujahua and Inguaran had begun, as well as the establishment of agricultural and livestock haciendas. The first school of higher education, called the Primera Casa de Altos Estudios en América, was founded by Alonso de la Veracruz in Tiripetío. Michoacán was made a separate province from &quot;Mexico&quot; in 1602. By the mid-17th century, the indigenous population had declined by half. In 1776, the territory of Michoacán was reduced to the area in which the modern states of Michoacán and Colima are now. Soon after, Colima split to join with the province of Guadalajara, leaving Michoacán roughly with the territory it has today.

During the entire colonial period, the economy was concentrated in the hands of the Spanish-born, who held vast lands and haciendas. They also held the rights over minerals mined in places such as Tlalpujahua, Angangueo and Huetamo. Indigenous peoples were exploited for their work, and slavery was not uncommon. Education was restricted for only those born in Spain and their descendants and was controlled by the Church. The main educational institutions were the Colegio de San Nicolas, founded in the 16th century; and the Seminary of San Pedro and San Pablo, founded in the 18th century. These schools produced a number of distinguished men, but the best-known is Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla.
At the end of the 18th century, ideas from Europe began to infiltrate the upper classes of the state, especially in Valladolid (Morelia) and Zamora. These would eventually lead to the Mexican War of Independence in the early 18th century. This war was foreshadowed by the 1809 conspiracy in Valladolid.

One of the early and main protagonists of the war, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, was educated as a priest in the state and began to disseminate Enlightenment ideas here. Soon after Hidalgo performed the Grito de Dolores in Dolores (now Dolores Hidalgo), Guanajuato, a number of people influenced by his thought took up arms against the colonial government. These included Manuel de la Torre Lloreda, Gertrudis Bocanegra, José María Garcia Obeso and Ignacio López Rayón. During his campaign, Hidalgo returned to Valladolid, issuing a decree eliminating slavery.

After Hidalgo&#x27;s death, much of the insurgency and spies against the Spanish viceroy were located in Michoacán, with documents such as the &quot;Primera Constitución o Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la América Mexicana&quot; (First Constitution or Constitutional Decree for the Liberty of the Mexican America) and &quot;Sentimentos de la Nacion&quot;, both of which would shape constitutions and governments in the years to come. The first Mexican Supreme Court was also founded here. The Mexican War of Independence was culminated by the army of Agustín de Iturbide, also a Michoacán native, who took Morelia in May 1821.

After the war ended in 1821, the territory of Michoacán became the &quot;Free and Sovereign State of Michoacán on January 31, 1824. This state was initially divided into 4 departments and 22 portions (partidos) under the Ley Territorial of 1825, with the first constitution ratified in the same year. The name of the capital was changed from Valladolid to Morelia at the same time.

In 1831, the state was reorganized into 61 municipals and 207 locales (tenencias). Due to the struggle between centralists and federalists in Mexico in the 19th century, Michoacán&#x27;s rights as an entity would change depending on who was in control. The state was declared a department in 1836 but became a more independent state again in 1846. Colima broke off from Michoacán to form its own state in this year. In 1849, the municipality of Coyuca was separated to form the state of Guerrero. In 1853, the state became a department again, regaining state status in 1856. In 1857, Contepec was separated from the state of Guanajuato and attached to Michoacán. In 1863, the diocese of Michoacán was reduced in size, but its status was also elevated to archdiocese.

During the French Intervention in Mexico, Morelia was taken by French forces in 1863. Since resistance to the French was particularly strong here, punitive acts were undertaken by the French in places like Zitácuaro, where much of the city was burned. One of the first victories against the French during the Intervention occurred in Zamora.

In 1907, Michoacán&#x27;s boundaries changed again with the addition of the communities of Pungarabato and Zirandaro added from Guerrero state to make the Balsas River a natural border. The Mexican Revolution came to Michoacán in 1911, when those loyal to Francisco I. Madero proclaimed Santa Clara del Cobre as their territory, then went on to take towns around Lake Patzcuaro under the leadership of Salvador Escalante. The governor of the state, Aristeo Mendoza, resigned. Fighting among various factions would continue in parts of the state for the rest of the war. The state&#x27;s current constitution was ratified in 1918. In 1920, the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo was founded.

Soon after the end of the Revolution, the Cristero War would affect the state, which affected agricultural production and distribution. In 1926, hostilities closed the seminaries in Morelia and Zamora. Near the end of the war, Lázaro Cárdenas was elected governor of the state and served until 1932; he became president of Mexico in 1934.

Michoacán has been badly affected by the Mexican Drug War, due to its methamphetamine and marijuana production. That resulted in the start of an anti-drug trafficking campaign in 2006, an anti-narcotics operation since 2006, grenade attacks in 2008, a shootout in 2015 as well as a massacre and clashes in 2019.

==Geography==

The state is located in the center west of the Mexican Republic, on the extreme southwest of the central highlands. It borders the states of Mexico, Querétaro, Guerrero, Guanajuato, Jalisco and Colima, with a coastline on the Pacific Ocean. The state has a territory of , making it the sixteenth-largest in Mexico (exactly at the midpoint among Mexican states in area). It also has of marine territory off its Pacific coast.

The state is crossed by the Sierra Madre del Sur, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Inter-mountain Valleys region. The Sierra Madre del Sur crosses the state northwest to southeast for approximately in the southwest between the municipalities of Chinicuila and Arteaga along the Pacific Coast. It is considered to be a continuation of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Peaks in this range average about above sea level, with the largest being the Cerro de las Canoas. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt crosses the state from west to east toward the Toluca Valley and Valley of Mexico. This mountain range is marked by appearance of many volcanoes, active, dormant, and extinct alike. This system is subdivided into regions such as the Sierra de Tancítaro, Sierra de Periban, Sierra de San Angel and others. The best-known volcano in this region is the Paricutín volcano. 

The state has a large number of lakes, waterfalls, lagoons, hot springs, and a natural system of waterways, including parts of two of the country&#x27;s largest rivers, the Lerma and the Balsas. These waterways are divided into three regions, called the North, Central and South. The North region includes the Lerma Basin. On the Lerma River is the Tepuxtepec Dam which has a capacity of 371 million m3. Rivers that empty into the Lerma in Michoacán include the Tlalpuhahua, Cachivi and Duero. Another river basin here is that of Lake Cuitzeo, which extends over an area of . The two main rivers that feed this lake are the Grande de Morelia and Queréndaro.

The Central region is represented by lakes Pátzcuaro and Zirahuén. Lake Pátzcuaro has a surface area of 1,525 km2. This lake is fed by a number of surface and subterranean water flows with the principal rivers leading here including the San Gregorio and Chapultepec. This lake has five islands within it called Janitzio, Yunuén, La Pacanda, Tecuén, Jarácuaro, Urandén and Carián. Lake Zirahuén has an area of and is fed by streams such as Manzanilla and Zinamba. These two lakes are considered to be the main tourist attraction of the state.

Most of the state&#x27;s rivers and streams are located in the south region of the state, with the Balsas River being the most important. The most important tributaries of this river include the Cutzamala, Carácuaro and Tepalcatepec rivers. Within this region is the coastal watershed, which is the area between the Sierra Madre del Sur and the coastline. This area includes small rivers such as the Coahuayana, Aquila, Ostula, Motín del Oro, Coire, Cachán and Nexpa which flow directly into the Pacific.

Much of the climate of the state is determined by altitude and other geographical features. Average temperatures vary from to . Lower temperatures correspond with the highland areas in the north and east while the lower south and west, called La Costa (the coast) or Tierra Caliente (hot land) register higher temperatures. In the hotter lowlands, high temperatures regularly exceed and have been known to reach over in the summer. The lowest temperatures are registered in highland areas such as the Sierra de Coalcomán and the Sierra del Centro located near the border with the State of Mexico. Except for the Tierra Caliente, most of the state can experience freezing temperatures in the winter. Rainfall is also dependent on altitude with the lowlands receiving less rain than the mountain areas. There is a well-defined rainy season which extends from June to October over the entire state.

===Flora===
Ecosystems vary by altitude. Between above sea level, most of the vegetation are conifer forests. Between , there are mixed forests and below this are broadleaf or tropical forests. Tree species include oak, cedar, fir and pine. Mango trees can be found in the eastern and western regions.

===Fauna===

Animal types vary from region to region but among mammals these can be found: skunks, raccoons, cacomistle, coyotes, lynxes, rabbits, bats, deer, armadillos, mountain lions, foxes, and jaguars. The latter is an important symbol in Purépecha culture. Numerous bird species can be found including water fowl such as ducks, storks and seabirds along the coast. Eagles, parrots, and hawks are found in the tropical and mountainous regions. Both owls and hummingbirds are important cultural symbols to the Purépecha. It is also one of three Mexican states where the tarantula species &quot;Brachypelma hamorii&quot; is found, the other two being Jalisco and Colima.
Tiger sharks, thresher sharks, and porpoises can be found in coastal waters. Reptiles including crocodiles, sea turtles, iguanas, snakes, and caimans can be found in the waterways and along the coastal regions. Michoacán includes critical over-wintering habitat for most of the monarch butterflies from eastern North America. To the Purépechas, the monarch butterfly symbolizes the spirits of the dead as they journey from the afterlife.


===Protected areas===
Protected areas in Michoacán include Barranca del Cupatitzio, 
Bosencheve, Cerro de Garnica, Insurgente José María Morelos, Lago de Camécuaro, and Rayón national parks, Monarch Butterfly and Zicuirán-Infiernillo biosphere reserves, and Pico de Tancítaro Flora and Fauna Protection Area. Lake Pátzcuaro and Zacapu Lagoon are Ramsar Sites, designated wetlands of international importance.

==Economy==

The economy of the state is based on agriculture, ranching, forest products, fishing and crafts. Most of the population is employed in three sectors: agriculture (34%), mining and manufacturing (23%), and commerce (37%).

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture occupies over a million hectares of land in the state or 20% of the land area. Three-fifths of this agriculture occurs only during the rainy season. Irrigation farming is restricted to areas such as the Apatzingán Valley, the Bajío area of Michoacán, the Zamora Valley and some others. Principal crops include corn, sorghum, avocados, strawberries, peaches, wheat, limes, sugar cane and mangos. While corn accounts for 43% of the crops harvested, Michoacán is the largest producer of avocados in Mexico and in the world. Forty three percent of farmland in the territory is dedicated to the raising of livestock, including cattle, domestic fowl, sheep, goats and pigs. In 2007, the state&#x27;s production of meat, dairy and eggs was valued at over four billion pesos.

=== Forestry ===
Sixty percent of the state is covered in forest, with the most economically important of these located in the higher elevations at the eastern side. These forests mostly produce lumber and resin. These areas are estimated at 2,160,000 hectares, over half of which is pine forest. The most productive forests are located in the central and eastern portions of the state. Rainforest areas are estimated at 460,500 hectares. One problem facing the forested areas of the state is unsustainable logging. In addition to exploitable forest, there are also ecological reserves with tourist importance, especially the various monarch butterfly sanctuaries in the extreme east of the state.

=== Fishing ===

Michoacán&#x27;s lakes, rivers and coastline make it an important producer of fish and seafood, both caught in the wild and farmed. The most important commercial fishing is for tilapia and carp.

=== Mining and minerals ===
Mining is an important economic activity in the state, which is mostly concentrated on the eastern side near the Mexico State border. However, iron is mined in the Lázaro Cárdenas area near the coast. Both metallic and non-metallic minerals are mined in the state. These include silver, gold, zinc, cadmium, lead, iron, copper, fill dirt, sand, gravel, lime, limestone, marble, and others. There are thirteen principal mining areas: Tlalpujahua, Angangueo, Los Azufres, Real de Otzumatlán, Tzitzio, Tiámaro, El Bastán, San Diego Curucupacéo, Inguarán, Las Truchas, and La Minita de Coalcomán. Michoacán is the second-largest producer of coke and third-largest producer of iron, which are essential to the steel industry, in Mexico. While there remains significant metallic deposits, their mining only contributes 1.64% to the economy.

=== Manufacturing ===
Most industrial activity is concentrated in the central region of the state, near the capital, where a number of industrial parks are located, such as Ciudad Industrial Morelia. However. there are other areas with industry, such as Apatzingán, Zamora, Jiquilpan and Sahuayo, as well as in the Lázaro Cárdenas area. Major production areas are iron and steel (34.27%), bottling (10.43%) and paper products (8.36%).
Most people in the state are employed in service and commerce, and this sector contributes 19.07% to the overall economy. Most sales are in foodstuffs, drinks and tobacco.


==Transport==
The state contains more than of federal, state and local roads. Major highways in the state include Federal Highway 15 and the Morelia-Patzcuaro highway. Intercity and interstate buses provide connections to places within the state and the rest of Mexico. About 91% of these bus lines are second class while just under nine percent are first class. Most rail lines are limited to the north and center of the state, providing freight service to Mexico City and Guadalajara. The state&#x27;s main port is the city of Lázaro Cárdenas which contains of dock space. The dock is used mostly for the shipping of minerals and grains. There are two major international airports, Morelia International Airport and Uruapan International Airport. Smaller facilities exist in Zamora and Lázaro Cárdenas. The state has abundant hydroelectrical production due to dams on the Balsas River, the Lerma River and the Tepalcatepec River.

==Media==
One notable actress from Santa Elena, Michoacán is Elpidia Carrillo. She is best known for starring in the 1987 science fiction horror film &quot;Predator&quot; alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger.

As of 1995, the state had eight television stations, with seven out of operation. There is a system of educational television with 528 broadcast antennas.

Newspapers and news sites of Michoacán de Ocampo include: &quot;La Opinión de Apatzingán&quot;, &quot;a. m. de La Piedad&quot;, &quot;Diario ABC de Michoacán&quot;, &quot;El Diario Grande de Michoacán Provincia&quot;, &quot;El Sol de Morelia&quot;, &quot;El Sol de Zamora&quot;, &quot;Frecuencia Informativa Escrita &quot;, &quot;La Jornada Michoacán&quot;, &quot;La Opinión de Michoacán&quot;, &quot;La Voz de Michoacán.&quot;

==Education==
The state provides public education from preschool level to high school. &quot;Formal preschool&quot; is offered in communities which have twenty five or more qualified students. Less formal preschools are operated in smaller communities. As of 1996, there were 5,433 primary schools serving 705,694 students with 25,485 teachers. There is a failure rate from grade to grade of about 9.7% with just under five percent leaving school permanently before finishing primary studies. The most common reason for departure is poverty. At the secondary level there are 174,354 students, which represent 22% of these eligible to attend. High school level studies are mostly geared to vocational studies and many attend via distance education. There are 24 public and private institutions of higher learning offering 49 different majors. Eight are technical colleges, four for teachers, the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, the Instituto Michoacano de Ciencias de la Educación and ten private institutions.

The Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo is located in Morelia. Its historical predecessor was founded in 1540, making it one of the oldest institutions of higher education in the Americas.

==Tourism==
Carnitas are originally from Michoacán. Other traditional foods include cotija cheese, guacamole, morisqueta, tamales, pozole, enchiladas, mole sauce, and various sweets such as pan de muerto and chocolate champurrado (during the Day of the Dead celebrations), ice cream, churros, and ate, a kind of Mexican jelly made of many typical fruits.

The state ministry of tourism has divided the state into regions, mostly based on the major cities of Morelia, Uruapan, Lázaro Cárdenas, Patzcuaro, Zamora and Zitácuaro. The state contains a large number of potential attractions, most of which are classified as suitable for ecotourism. However, only 6.2% of these sites are visited by international tourists. Most visitors to sites are from within the state.

The Morelia region stresses its cultural and artistic heritage, especially its colonial architecture . The most important colonial structures are in Morelia and built in the 18th century. These include the cathedral, finished in 1744 and the main aqueduct finished at the end of the century. This architecture has made the city a World Heritage Site. In addition to the state capital, the region includes towns such as Charo, Capula, Tiripetio, Cuitzeo and Huandacareo, which contain archaeological sites, water parks and traditional cuisine. The rural areas of this zone contain more than 400 thermal springs, many of which have been turned into recreational areas and parks. These include Reino de Atzimba, Cointzio, Huandacareo and El Ejido. Morelia holds the annual &quot;Festival Internacional de Música de Morelia&quot;. The festival consists of more than forty concerts with over 500 artists from Michoacán and from around the world. Other festivals include the popular &quot;SalsaMich&quot; that features a 3-day Salsa dance competition. The &quot;Festival Internacional de Cine de Morelia&quot; is celebrated annually that is dedicated to Mexican cinema. The Plaza Monumental de Morelia was established in 1951, which was destined exclusively for bullfights. Nowadays, the ring also hosts concerts, lucha libre, and weddings.

The Uruapan region stresses its cultural and natural heritage. The city is one of the oldest settlements in the state, which was initially settled by the Meseta Purépecha. This city contains a number of attractions such as La Huatápera, colonial era hospital founded by Vasco de Quiroga, the Temple of San Francisco and the Eduardo Ruiz Municipal Museum. One other attraction is the narrowest house in the world as documented by the Guinness Book of World Records. Other important cities in the region are Apatzingán and Caracha.
Uruapan is surrounded by hundreds of hectares of forests and by fertile fields growing fruits and flowers, many of which only grow here. Some of the natural attractions of the zone include the Santa Catarina Dam and the La Tzaráacua and La Tzararacuita waterfalls. Smaller towns and villages in this region are known for their religious and popular festivals, many of which occur in the summer. Examples of these are the feasts of Señor del Calvario in Quinceo, of San Mateo Ahuiran in Paracho and the National Guitar Festival in Paracho. The best-known town in the region is San Juan Nuevo Parangaricutiro, which was founded due to the destruction of its original namesake by the eruption of the Paricutín volcano. The pre-Hispanic sites of Tingambato and Taretan are in this zone as well, which were important Purépecha cities.

The town of Paracho is well known throughout both Mexico and elsewhere in the world as a hub of lutherie. This is because the town&#x27;s craftsmen are reputed to making the best sounding guitars and vihuelas in all of Mexico. The town is full of music shops that sell ten-string mandolins, armadillo-backed guitars (concheras), acoustic bass guitars; as well as regular classical guitars and mandolins, bajo sextos, vihuelas, guitarrones and many others. Many of the stores and workshops allow visitors to watch the guitar-making process directly. 
The Lázaro Cárdenas region is named after Michoacán&#x27;s largest port and oceanside city. Here the state stresses the kilometres of beaches and other natural areas in which to practice ecotourism and extreme sports. Beaches include Maruata, Faro de Bucerías, the Pichi Estuary, La Laguna de Mezcala, La Ticla and Nexpa, with the last two popular for surfing, with their regular two-three-meter waves. A number of these beaches are protected areas, due to being a breeding ground for sea turtles.

The Patzcuaro region is extremely important to the state due to its history of having been the center of the Purépecha Empire as well as the first capital of the colonial province of Michoacán. Its pre-Hispanic heritage is evident by the Tzintzuntzan and Ihuatizo sites as well as the large number of people who still speak the Purépecha language and maintain pre-Hispanic customs. Vasco de Quiroga established the first capital at Patzcuaro and was instrumental to building the colonial era economy of the Lake Patzcuaro area. The lake is surrounded by mountains and forests as well as the towns of Cuanajo, Tupátaro, Eronguícuaro and Quiroga. These towns are noted for their crafts and popular religious festivals such as the feast of the Señor del Rescate in Tzintzuntzan, Holy Week, and especially Noche de Muertos or Night of the Dead. This area is the most important to the state with the most visited town, Patzcuaro with its basilica and museums.

One of the largest tourist events in the state is Noche de Muertos or Night of the Dead. This is celebrated on the dates around November 2. Essentially, these are Day of the Dead celebrations, which are celebrated all over Mexico, but with unique variations. The events of these days show a blending of both pre-Hispanic and Catholic beliefs and traditions. Noche de Muertos is celebrated most strongly in the towns and villages around Lake Patzcuaro such as Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio, Janitzio, as well as Patzcuaro itself, which was the center of the Purépecha Empire. As in other parts of Mexico, altars to the dead, both in homes and on graves are erected and covered with offerings such as bread, fruit and other items. One aspect which is unique to the event here is the lighting and floating of hundreds of small candles and flowers on Lake Patzcuaro on the night between November 1 and 2. It is also believed that on this night the ghosts of Mintzita, the daughter of Purépecha king Tzintzicha, and Itzihuapa arise. Their story is similar to that of Romeo and Juliet as they were never able to marry due to the Spanish invasion of their lands. Today, it is said that the two rise up and head toward a specific cemetery to receive visitors. There are a number of other rituals performed on these days such as the Terescuan y Campaneri, a kind of treasure hunt for hidden harvest items.

The Zamora region is center of the city of the same name in an area known as the Purépecha Mesa. Pre-Hispanic language and customs are preserved here as well as a large number of crafts such as the pottery of Ptamban and the embroidery of Tarecuato. The region is part of an area of Mexico known as the Bajío and has extensive agriculture, livestock and some industry. Regional dishes such as pigs&#x27; feet, breads baked in wood fired ovens, tamales, pozole and dishes made with avocados and corn are promoted here. Important towns outside of Zamora include Camécuaro, Orandiro, La Estancia and La Alberca. The city of Zamora is home to one of the oldest cultures in the west of Mexico which dates to about 1750 BCE, known as the Opeño. The Spanish city was founded as a military garrison.

The Zitacuaro region contains approximately a half million hectares of conifer forests, but is best known as being part of the wintering grounds of the monarch butterfly. The area is filled with old mining towns as well as an important archaeological site. The region is home to the Mazahua and Otomi peoples, many of whom produce crafts such as blankets, rebozos and ceramics. The city of Zitacuaro is the site of an important battle during the French Intervention in Mexico, which gives it the title of &quot;Heroic City&quot;. Other important communities include Añgangueo, San Matias and Ciudad Hidalgo. The most important places to see monarch butterflies in the winter are in municipalities of Angangeo and Ocampo. The butterfly sanctuaries are called El Rosario, Cerro Campanario, Sierra Chincua and El Llanno de las Papas. In 2008, UNESCO declared this region part of a Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve.

==Crime==
After the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) fell from power in 2000, the surge in criminal violence was unexpected. From homicides and kidnappings to organized crime, the violence that began to emerge while in a position of political change had posed a significant threat to the nation’s stability. Even though criminal groups and the state are on two ends of the spectrum, they are seen working together. Some criminal groups have an upper hand when it comes to the state and the sharing of information between the two happens as a mutually beneficial concept.

In Michoacán, the criminal groups are better equipped with more weapons than the state security forces, which means they simply overpower the local security forces. With the heavy influence of criminal violence, even avocado producers had to step in and combat this violence. Michoacán is the second largest avocado producer in the entire world, and with that territory comes criminal groups demanding money from the avocado producers. Tancítaro has assembled the CUSEPT, civilian gunmen funded by local avocado growers, to protect against organized crime. Such non-governmental police groups have been formed because local police are sometimes seen as unhelpful or complicit. Turf disputes happen too.

=== War on drugs ===
When President Felipe Calderón was in office in 2006 he sent troops into Michoacán to regain power over the state and to fight the current cartels that had power. His efforts ended up creating more violence, and the number of homicides skyrocketed. The state of Michoacán has some of the highest murder rates throughout Mexico. In 2013, the criminal group, the Knights Templar Cartel, had essentially run the state. While they eventually lost the control they once had, excessive criminal violence persisted, and many civilians were in between feuds if they happened to be on enemy territory. The dispute is different criminal groups going to war on each other over drugs, money, and land but no authority is stepping in to end the disputes because these criminal groups are simply too powerful and are much more equipped than the State officials.

===Killings===
Homicide happens frequently in Michoacán.
On 26–28 October 2019, 9 people and 4 police were killed in a firefight from a search warrant.
9 people, 3 of whom were children, were killed in a video game arcade on February 3, 2020.

===Kidnappings and Ransoms===
There have been aggressive disputes in the area, such as those over avocados.

===Drug Cartels===

The rise of drug cartels in Michoacan as the state was going through a political change was pivotal. The cartels are able to pay state officials to do their dirty work for them in exchange for keeping their criminal group up and successful. Adding on to the fluidity of criminal groups and government officials working together, the hope for Mexico to strengthen its powers back into a non-corrupt state is not high. La Familia Michoacana, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Los Zetas, Beltrán-Leyva Organization, the Knights Templar Cartel and Cárteles Unidos are some groups that operate in Michoacán. These groups are a threat to the government&#x27;s security because Michoacán is now the center for drug production in the world. The reason drug cartels seem to thrive in Michoacán is due to what is called the &quot;Tierra Caliente&quot; in the southern part of the State. This region is far from the bustling atmosphere and with roads that are pretty inaccessible, it makes for an ideal place to do criminal activities.

===Police and Militia===
Operation Michoacán takes place in Michoacán. There are militias in Michoacán.

=== Crime during COVID-19 ===
Due to crime, the United States Bureau of Consular Affairs advises not to travel to Michoacán ( During the COVID-19 pandemic, while the Mexican government was occupied, cartels took advantage as an opportunity to gain more power. In Michoacán, La Familia Michoacana cartel decided to give out food to the local community. This was an effort to further embed themselves in a position to control power and to show civilians that they need criminal groups like La Familia Michoacana.

==Demographics==
=== Largest cities===

Michoacán is the seventh most populated state in Mexico and the average resident has a life expectancy of 73.3 years. It is estimated that each year about 40,000 people immigrate to the state while 78,000 leave, leading to population loss. Of those who leave, about one third go to other places in Mexico and the rest to other countries, principally the United States. The cities with the densest populations are Morelia, Uruapan and Zamora. The majority of the population are mestizos; meaning that they are part indigenous, part European (mainly from Spain), along with African. Michoacán is one of the most Catholic regions in Mexico.

Charreada is an important sport in the state. It celebrates the mestizo culture and heritage of Michoacán; in which the Spaniards employed the indigenous people as vaqueros or ranchers to herd cattle. During the Mexican Revolution, both sides used charros as soldiers. They were also used to maintain order against bandits. The typical Michoacán charro outfit consists of tight, embroidered pants and jacket, dress shirt, chaps, a cloak-like sarape, and a sombrero.

Michoacán has a history of European immigrants including: Italians, Spaniards, and the French. There are small Italian communities found throughout the state including the cities of Nueva Italia, Michoacán and Lombardia in Michoacán, both founded by Dante Cusi from Gambar in Brescia.
During the Spanish Civil War, 456 children from Spain arrived in Morelia as refugees. Most of them stayed even after the war concluded.

The indigenous population is estimated at just over seven percent of the total, with most living in 29 municipalities. Many are Purépecha, which are located in the Meseta-Cañada, Patzcuaro Lake, Zirahuén Lake, and Zacapu regions. In the east of the state, in the municipalities of Ocampo, Anguangueo, Tuxpan, Hidalgo, Maravatío and Zitácuaro, there is a mix of Mazahua, Otomi and Purépecha. On the coast can be found the Aquila, Chinicuila and Coahuayana peoples. The Purépecha are seen as Michoacán&#x27;s most devoted Catholics; as well as mixing traditional indigenous elements such as Noche de Muertos.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.55% of Michoacán&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

<text>PayPal Holdings, Inc. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system in the majority of countries that support online money transfers; it serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods such as checks and money orders. The company operates as a payment processor for online vendors, auction sites and many other commercial users, for which it charges a fee.

Established in 1998 as Confinity, PayPal went public through an IPO in 2002. It became a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay later that year, valued at $1.5 billion. In 2015 eBay spun off PayPal to its shareholders, and PayPal became an independent company again.
The company was ranked 143rd on the 2022 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue. Since 2023 PayPal is a member of the MACH Alliance.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The company was originally established by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek in December 1998 as Fieldlink. Later it was renamed Confinity, a company which developed security software for hand-held devices. When it had no success with that business model, it switched its focus to a digital wallet. The first version of the PayPal electronic payments system was launched in 1999.

In March 2000, Confinity merged with X.com, an online financial services company founded in March 1999 by Elon Musk, Harris Fricker, Christopher Payne, and Ed Ho. Musk was optimistic about the future success of the money transfer business Confinity was developing. Musk and Bill Harris, then-president and CEO of X.com, disagreed about the potential future success of the money transfer business and Harris left the company in May 2000. In October of that year, Musk decided that X.com would terminate its other internet banking operations and focus on payments. In the same month, Elon Musk was replaced by Peter Thiel as CEO of X.com, which was renamed PayPal in June 2001 and went public in 2002. PayPal&#x27;s IPO listed under the ticker PYPL at $13 per share and generated over $61 million.

=== eBay subsidiary (2002–2014) ===

Shortly after PayPal&#x27;s IPO, eBay acquired the company on October 3, 2002, for $1.5 billion in eBay stock. More than 70 percent of all eBay auctions accepted PayPal payments, and roughly 1 in 4 closed auction listings were transacted via PayPal. PayPal became the default payment method used by the majority of eBay users, and the service competed with eBay&#x27;s subsidiary Billpoint, as well as Citibank&#x27;s c2it, Yahoo!&#x27;s PayDirect, and Google Checkout.

In 2005, PayPal acquired the VeriSign payment solution to provide added security support. In 2007, PayPal announced a partnership with MasterCard, which led to the development and launch of the PayPal Secure Card service, a software that allows customers to make payments on websites that do not accept PayPal directly. By the end of 2007, the company generated $1.8 billion in revenue. In January 2008, PayPal acquired Fraud Sciences, a privately held Israeli start-up that developed online risk tools, for $169 million. In November 2008, the company acquired Bill Me Later, an online transactional credit company.

By 2010, PayPal had over 100 million active user accounts in 190 markets through 25 different currencies. In July 2011, fourteen alleged members of the Anonymous hacktivist group were charged with attempting to disrupt PayPal&#x27;s operations. The denial of service attacks occurred in December 2010, after PayPal stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks. On 5 December 2013, 13 of the PayPal 14 pleaded guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges related to the attacks.

The company continued to build its Merchant Services division, providing e-payments for retailers on eBay. In 2011, PayPal announced that it would begin moving its business offline so that customers can make payments via PayPal in stores. In August 2012, the company announced its partnership with Discover Card to allow PayPal payments to be made at any of the seven million stores in the Discover network. By the end of 2012, PayPal&#x27;s total payment volume processed was . and accounted for 40% of eBay&#x27;s revenue, amounting to in the 3rd quarter of 2012.

In 2013, PayPal acquired IronPearl, a Palo Alto startup offering engagement software, and Braintree, a Chicago-based payment gateway, to further product development and mobile services. In June 2014 David Marcus announced he was leaving his role as PayPal President; Marcus joined PayPal in August 2011 after its acquisition of Zong, of which he was the founder and CEO. David Marcus succeeded Scott Thompson as president, who left the role to join Yahoo. PayPal announced that Marcus would be succeeded by Dan Schulman, who previously served as CEO of Virgin Mobile and Executive vice president of American Express.

=== Spin-off from eBay (2014–present) ===

It was announced on September 30, 2014, that eBay would spin off PayPal into a separate publicly traded company, a move demanded in 2013 by activist hedge fund magnate Carl Icahn. The spin-off was completed on July 18, 2015. On January 31, 2018, eBay announced &quot;After the existing eBay-PayPal agreement ends in 2020, PayPal will remain a payment option for shoppers on eBay, but it won&#x27;t be prominently featured ahead of debit and credit card options as it is today. PayPal will cease to process card payments for eBay at that time.&quot; The company will &quot;instead begin working with Amsterdam-based Adyen&quot;.

On July 1, 2015, PayPal announced that it was acquiring digital money transfer company Xoom Corporation. PayPal spent $25 a share in cash to acquire the publicly traded Xoom, or about $1.09 billion. The deal was closed in the fourth quarter of 2015. The move strengthened PayPal’s international business, giving it access to Xoom’s 1.3 million active U.S. customers that sent about $7 billion in the 12 months ending on March 31, to people in 37 countries.

On September 1, 2015, PayPal launched its peer-to-peer payment platform &quot;PayPal.Me&quot;, a service that allows users to send a custom link to request funds via text, email, or other messaging platforms. Custom links are set to be structured as PayPal.me/username/amount requested. PayPal.Me was launched in 18 countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Canada, Russia, Turkey, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland. PayPal had 170 million users, as of September 2015, and the focus of PayPal.Me was to create a mobile-first user experience that enables faster payment sharing than PayPal&#x27;s traditional tools.

On May 17, 2018, PayPal agreed to purchase Swedish payment processor iZettle for $2.2 billion. This was PayPal&#x27;s largest acquisition until late November 2019 and the company claims that it is the in-store expertise and digital marketing strength that will complement its own online and mobile payment services. In 2018, PayPal became a jersey patch sponsor of the Phoenix Suns.

In October 2019, PayPal reported a loss of $228 million on investments, largely due to a failed return from a $500 million investment in Uber. On January 6, 2020, PayPal acquired Honey for over $4 billion. This is PayPal&#x27;s largest acquisition to date. It more recently signed a deal with NBCUniversal. In June 2020, PayPal announced a $530 million commitment to support Black-owned businesses and minority communities in the United States.

In January 2021, PayPal became the first foreign operator with 100% control of a payment platform in China, gaining an advanced position in the local online payment market. In an international survey conducted in March 2021 by Morning Consult, PayPal was found to be the second most trusted brand globally. In June 2022, Shopify partnered with PayPal to offer Shopify Payments to merchants in France. In February 2023, PayPal announced layoffs for 2,000 of its workers, or 7% of its total workforce. It was reported in February 2023, that CEO Dan Schulman will step away from his role by the end of 2023. Schulman will continue to serve on the board of directors after vacating the position. In August 2023, the company named Intuit executive Alex Chriss CEO, effective September 27, 2023.

In August 2023, PayPal launched a U.S. dollar stablecoin, called PayPal USD (PYUSD) for payments and transfers. In November 2023, it was announced that the SEC launched a legal investigation into both PayPal and Paxos, the trust responsible for issuing the stablecoin. Paypal said it was cooperating with the subpoena from the SEC’s Enforcement Division. In October 2023, it was announced PayPal has sold its reverse logistics subsidiary, Happy Returns to UPS for an undisclosed amount.

PayPal Credit allows consumers to shop online in much the same way as they would with a traditional credit card. The rebranding of Bill Me Later as PayPal Credit also means that consumers can use PayPal Credit to fund transactions virtually anywhere PayPal is accepted.

, PayPal operates in 202 markets and has 426 million active, registered accounts. PayPal allows customers to send, receive, and hold funds in 25 currencies worldwide.

=== Business model evolution ===
PayPal&#x27;s success in users and volumes was the product of a three-phase strategy described by former eBay CEO Meg Whitman: &quot;First, PayPal focused on expanding its service among eBay users in the US. Second, we began expanding PayPal to eBay&#x27;s international sites. And third, we started to build PayPal&#x27;s business off eBay.&quot;

==== Phase 1 ====

In the first phase, payment volumes were coming mostly from the eBay auction website. The system was very attractive to auction sellers, most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards, and for consumers as well. In fact, many sellers could not qualify for a credit card Merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history. The service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund PayPal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances, without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers. PayPal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth, depositing $10 in new users&#x27; PayPal accounts.

==== Phase 2 ====

Until 2000, PayPal&#x27;s strategy was to earn interest on funds in PayPal accounts. However, most recipients of PayPal credits withdrew funds immediately. Also, many senders funded their payments using credit cards, which cost PayPal roughly 2% of payment value per transaction.

To solve this problem, PayPal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts. Instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds, PayPal started relying on earnings from service charges. They offered seller protection to PayPal account holders, provided that they comply with reimbursement policies. For example, PayPal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over $750.

==== Phase 3 ====

After fine-tuning PayPal&#x27;s business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on eBay, PayPal started its off-eBay strategy. This was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple platforms, despite the slowdown in on-eBay growth and low-single-digit user growth on the eBay site. A late 2003 reorganization created a new business unit within PayPal—Merchant Services—to provide payment solutions to small and large e-commerce merchants outside the eBay auction community. Starting in the second half of 2004, PayPal Merchant Services unveiled several initiatives to enroll online merchants outside the eBay auction community, including:

* Lowering its transaction fee for high-volume merchants from 2.2% to 1.9% (while increasing the monthly transaction volume required to qualify for the lowest fee to $100,000)
* Encouraging its users to recruit non-eBay merchants by increasing its referral bonus to a maximum of $1,000 (versus the previous $100 cap)
* Persuading credit card gateway providers, including CyberSource and Retail Decisions USA, to include PayPal among their offerings to online merchants.
* Hiring a new sales force to acquire large merchants such as Dell, Apple&#x27;s iTunes, and Yahoo! Stores, which hosted thousands of online merchants
* Reducing fees for online music purchases and other &quot;micropayments&quot;
* Launching PayPal Mobile, which allowed users to make payments using text messaging on their cell phones

=== Global reach ===

PayPal can be used in more than 200 countries/regions.

Different countries have different conditions: &quot;Send only&quot; (Package Service allows sending only, valid in 97 countries), &quot;PayPal Zero&quot; (package suggests the possibility of enrollment, entry, and withdrawal of funds in foreign currency, but the user can not hold the balance PayPal account, operates in 18 countries), &quot;SRW Send – Receive – Withdrawal&quot; (the possibility of enrollment, input-output and the ability to keep your PayPal account balance in the currency and to transfer to the card when the user sees fit, operates in 41 countries) and &quot;Local Currency&quot; (SRW plus opportunity to conduct transactions in the local currency, 21 countries).

==== China ====

In July 2017, PayPal announced a partnership with Baidu, to allow the Chinese firm‘s 100 million mobile wallet users to make payments to PayPal’s 17 million merchants through the Baidu service.

==== Crimea ====

In January 2015, PayPal ceased operations in Crimea in compliance with international sanctions against Russia and Crimea.

==== India ====

As of March 2011, PayPal has made changes to the User Agreement for Indian users to comply with Reserve Bank of India regulations. The per transaction limit had been set to USD $3,000, since October 14, 2011. However, on July 29, 2013, PayPal increased the per transaction limit to USD $10,000. This brings the per transaction limit for India in line with the restrictions imposed by PayPal in most other countries.

PayPal has disabled sending and receiving personal payments in India, thus forcing all recipients to pay a transaction fee.

PayPal plans to make India an incubation center for the company&#x27;s employee engagement policies. In 2012, PayPal hired 120 people for its offices in Chennai and Bengaluru.

On 8 November 2017, PayPal launched domestic operations under PayPal Payments Private Limited and now provides digital payment solutions for merchants and customers in India. As of 2020, Paypal supports the domestic card system RuPay and is planning to further integrate Unified Payment Interface (UPI) in collaboration with National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). PayPal now has the largest global engineering team in India outside of the US, which is spread over Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.

==== Israel and Palestinian Territories ====

PayPal is available in Israel but is not available in the Palestinian territories. Nor can Palestinians working in the West Bank or Gaza access it but Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank can use PayPal. This decision has prompted Palestinian tech companies to seek a policy change from PayPal.

==== Japan ====

In late March 2010, new Japanese banking regulations forced PayPal Japan to suspend the ability of personal account holders registered in Japan to send or receive money between individuals, and as a result these account holders are now subject to PayPal&#x27;s business fees on all transactions.

==== Pakistan ====

In Pakistan, users can use Xoom, a money transfer service owned by PayPal. In October 2018, Pakistan&#x27;s government used Xoom to help crowdsource funds for the purpose of building two dams.

==== Turkey ====

Eight years after the company first started operating in the country, Paypal ceased operations in Turkey on 6 June 2016 when Turkish financial regulator BDDK denied it a payment license. The regulators had demanded that PayPal&#x27;s data centers be located inside Turkey to facilitate compliance with government and court orders to block content and to generate tax revenue. PayPal said that the closure will affect tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of consumers in Turkey.

==== Sri Lanka ====

In January 2017, the PayPal team was scheduled to visit Sri Lanka in mid-January to re-establish links. In Sri Lanka as of 2021, PayPal can be used only to send money.

==== Russia ====
In March 2022, PayPal suspended all activities in Russia due to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==== Ukraine ====
In March 2022, PayPal expanded its services for Ukrainian accounts, allowing them to send and receive money from friends and family. Previously, PayPal users in Ukraine could only send money internationally from their accounts, not receive it.

==== Kenya ====
In 2018, PayPal and Safaricom collaborated to enable Kenyans to perform MPESA transactions by leveraging on the latter&#x27;s mobile money service

==== Indonesia ====
In 30 July 2022, Kominfo blocked PayPal for missing a deadline to register as an electronic services operator under Bank Indonesia or the Financial Services Authority as required by new licensing rules. This resulted in PayPal users in Indonesia being unable to access their funds stored in PayPal, until Kominfo temporarily unblocked the service for 5 days to allow users to withdraw their money. PayPal was fully unblocked on 3 August 2022 after registering as an electronic systems operator under the new rules.

=== PayPal Giving Fund ===

PayPal Giving Fund is a registered charity supported by PayPal that streamlines donations to non-profit organizations.

== Digital marketing with PayPal ==

PayPal launches different marketing activities in various channels and emphasizes that consumers can use it in different ways. Its marketing includes TV commercials, outdoor advertising, Facebook, and display advertisement.

PayPal provides free analytics to traders about the ways that consumers utilize online payments. Through the free tracking service, PayPal assists traders in targeting consumers. PayPal&#x27;s code gathers the consumer information, which can be installed on the trader&#x27;s website. PayPal partners with Synchrony Financial to provide the PayPal Cashback Mastercard, which offers 3% cash back to customers who use the card to make purchases using PayPal, and 1.5% cash back on all other purchases. PayPal additionally gives its users the ability to earn cash back when they checkout using PayPal at select merchants, though customers must activate the offer before they checkout.

Apple allows PayPal as a mode of payment for App Store, Apple Music, iTunes, and Apple Books. In addition, PayPal receives revenue from Apple services, especially from the App Store. Customers can use PayPal to make purchases by linking their PayPal accounts to their Apple IDs. In 2024, PayPal debit cards were allowed to be added to Apple Wallets. This feature was introduced in what was described as the &quot;biggest ad campaign to date&quot; for PayPal. A commercial with Will Ferrell singing a slightly revised version of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Everywhere&quot; debuted before the first ESPN broadcast of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; of the 2024 season.

== Regulation ==

Thiel, a founder of PayPal, has said that PayPal is not a bank because it does not engage in fractional-reserve banking. Rather, PayPal&#x27;s funds that have not been disbursed are kept in commercial interest-bearing checking accounts.

In the United States, PayPal is licensed as a money transmitter, on a state-by-state basis. But state laws vary, as do their definitions of banks, narrow banks, money services businesses, and money transmitters. Although PayPal is not classified as a bank, the company is subject to some of the rules and regulations governing the financial industry, including Regulation E consumer protections and the USA PATRIOT Act. 

The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from peer-to-peer (P2P) payments using credit and debit cards. Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z). TILA/Z requires specific procedures for billing errors, dispute resolution, and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges. Similarly, the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1693-1693r, as implemented by Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 205, (EFTA/E). EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a &quot;payment intermediary&quot; and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit card transaction occurs via PayPal. Basically, unless a PayPal transaction is funded with a credit card, the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller.

In 2008, PayPal Europe was granted a Luxembourg banking license, which, under European Union (EU) law, allows it to conduct banking business throughout the EU. It is therefore regulated as a bank by Luxembourg&#x27;s banking supervisory authority, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). All of the company&#x27;s European accounts were transferred to PayPal&#x27;s bank in Luxembourg in July 2007. Prior to the move, PayPal had been registered in the United Kingdom (UK) as PayPal (Europe) Ltd, an entity which was licensed as an Electronic Money Issuer with the UK&#x27;s Financial Services Authority (FSA) from 2004. This ceased in 2007, when the company moved to Luxembourg.

In India, as of January 2010, PayPal has no cross-border money transfer authorization. In an emailed response to questions from The New York Times, Reserve Bank of India spokeswoman Alpana Killawalla said, &quot;Providers of cross-border money transfer service need prior authorization from the Reserve Bank under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act. PayPal does not have our authorization.&quot; As of 2010, PayPal did not have the required Certificate of Authorization.

PaisaPay is an Indian sister service to PayPal. It is owned by eBay. PaisaPay makes possible payments from abroad by PayPal account holders to Indian sellers on eBay.in.

In Australia, PayPal is licensed as an authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI) and is thus subject to Australian banking laws and regulations. 

In Singapore, PayPal holds a stored value facility that does not require the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

== Safety and protection policies ==

The PayPal Buyer Protection Policy states that customers may file a buyer complaint for not receiving an item or if the purchased item was significantly not as described. The customer can open a dispute within 180 days from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within 20 days from opening the dispute. 

Buyers using a credit card might get a refund via chargeback from their credit-card company. However, in the UK, where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections (that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation) under Section 75 Consumer Credit Act 1974, the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via PayPal.

Also, the Financial Ombudsman Service (for the U.K.) position is that section 75 protection does not apply where PayPal or any eMoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction. This leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service. They only would have recourse in the courts, but in any event they cannot because PayPal is incorporated in Luxembourg and, since the UK has left the EU, is now no longer within the jurisdiction of any UK Courts. The key issues that determine the applicability of section 75 are identified very clearly in Office of Fair Trading v Lloyds TSB Bank Plc and others [2006] EWCA Civ 268 7 and the Bank of Scotland v Alfred Truman (a firm) [2005] [EWHC] 583 (QB). This is a legal authority that section 75 protection does exist where one has paid on a credit card for a product, via an eMoney service.

According to PayPal, it protects sellers in a limited fashion via the Seller Protection Policy. In general, the Seller Protection Policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if the seller meets certain conditions, including proof of delivery to the buyer. PayPal states the Seller Protection Policy is &quot;designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of non-receipt of any merchandise&quot;. The policy includes a list of &quot;Exclusions&quot; which itself includes &quot;Intangible goods&quot;, &quot;Claims for receipt of goods &#x27;not as described, and &quot;Total reversals over the annual limit&quot;. There are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself, the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to (simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the Seller Protection Policy is in effect). The PayPal Seller Protection Policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by UK consumer legislation &quot;(most notably the Consumer Rights Act 2015)&quot; and in addition, it cannot be enforced in the Courts because PayPal operates from Luxembourg, outside all three of the UK legal jurisdictions.

==Security==

=== Security token ===
In early 2006, PayPal introduced an optional security key as an additional precaution against fraud. A user account tied to a security key has a modified login process. Account-holders enter their login ID and password as normal, but are then prompted to enter a six-digit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holder&#x27;s mobile phone. For convenience, users may append the code generated by the hardware key to their password in the login screen. This way they are not prompted for it on another page. This method is required for some services, such as when using PayPal through the eBay application on iPhone.

This two-factor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key, although it does not prevent the so-called Man in the Browser (MITB) attacks. However, the user (or malicious third party) can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on their account. Thus, the PayPal implementation does not offer the security of true two-factor authentication.

=== MTAN ===

It is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mTAN (Mobile Transaction Authentication Number) via SMS. Use of a security code that is sent to the account holder&#x27;s mobile phone is currently free.

== Fraud ==

As early as 2001, PayPal had substantial problems with online fraud, especially international hackers who were hacking into PayPal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts. Standard solutions for merchant and banking fraud might use government criminal sanctions to pursue the fraudsters. But with PayPal losing millions of dollars each month to fraud while experiencing difficulties with using the FBI to pursue cases of international fraud, PayPal developed a fraud monitoring system to detect potentially fraudulent transactions. This development of fraud monitoring software at PayPal led Peter Thiel to create Palantir, a big-data security company whose original mission was to &quot;reduce terrorism while preserving civil liberties.&quot;

=== 150,000 PayPal cards frozen ===

In 2015, 150,000 Spanish cardholders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a PayPal service provider, Younique Money, which was the de facto administrator of the cards. Previously, PayPal had charged €15 to all its card users without authorization (150,000 users). As of March 2015, most funds had not been returned.

=== Predatory business practices ===
On December 21, 2024, YouTuber MegaLag uploaded a video revealing how the popular online shopping web browser extension Honey was indiscriminately stealing money from online creators who use affiliate links, including from YouTubers who Honey was paying to sponsor the extension in their videos.

Usually, when a person clicks on an affiliate link to a productsuch as one provided in the description of a YouTube video sponsoring the product, or one embedded in a product review articlea revenue cookie is generated for the affiliate link, so that if someone buys a product because they saw a promotion of that product, the promotor will be credited for the sale and be paid a percentage. If the buyer clicks on multiple affiliate links for a product before buying it, usually the last clicked link is the one credited for the sale.

However, if a buyer had the Honey extension installed in their browser, then upon reaching a merchant&#x27;s checkout page, the extension would ask if the buyer wanted Honey to check for coupons. If the buyer clicked yes, Honey would delete the cookie for the last clicked afffiliate link and replace it with Honey&#x27;s own affiliate cookie, regardless of whether or not the buyer used any of the coupons Honey found, and even if Honey didn&#x27;t offer any coupons at all. By doing this, Honey would take all the affiliate credit and money for the sale, leaving the creator who actually promoted the product (who owned the supplanted affiliate link) with nothing.

Honey has also been exposed for intentionally hiding better deals that users would recommend online and instead pulling out worse discounts from the cashback program, which the company has full control over. 

== Criticism and controversies ==


In 2003, PayPal voluntarily ceased serving as a payment intermediary between gambling websites and their online customers. At the time of this cessation, it was the largest payment processor for online gambling transactions. In 2010, PayPal resumed accepting such transactions, but only in those countries where online gambling is legal, and only for sites which are properly licensed to operate in said jurisdictions. 

Since at least 2005, PayPal has maintained an Acceptable Use policy which disallows &quot;transactions involving... items that are considered obscene... [or] certain sexually oriented materials or services.&quot; Their enforcement of the policy has been a constant source of controversy between PayPal and people within or related to the sex industry. In 2014, PayPal notified subscription service provider Patreon that it was moving to cease integration with Patreon as a platform as the result of Patreon permitting &quot;adult content&quot; on their platform. Patreon then removed access to PayPal services for creators who produced sexual content.

If PayPal determines an account has been used for fraud, for another purpose that violates PayPal&#x27;s Acceptable Use Policy, or without the account holder&#x27;s authorization, PayPal puts limitations on, or freezes, the account. PayPal has been involved in several public controversies or disputes after freezing the account of high profile users such as Richard Kyankathen-owner of the website Something Awfulin September 2005, Cryptome in March 2010, and April Winchellthe owner of Regretsyin December 2011. The account was reinstated, and PayPal apologized and donated to her cause. In September 2010, PayPal froze the account of Markus Persson, a Minecraft developer. Persson publicly said that he had not received a clear explanation from PayPal as to why the account was frozen, and that PayPal was threatening to keep the money in the account if they found any suspicious activity. His account contained around €600,000 ($655,842 USD). 

PayPal&#x27;s partner MasterCard ceased taking donations to WikiLeaks in 2010, and after the U.S. State Department said WikiLeaks was engaged in illegal activities, PayPal followed suit by suspendingand later permanently restrictingpayments to the website. Hacktivist supporters of WikiLeaks retaliated by coordinating cyber attacks on PayPal, MasterCard, and other companies that took action against WikiLeaks.

In February 2011, PayPal the account of a website that supports Iraq War resisters after it had enough information to fulfill its know your customer guidelines. The Chelsea Manning Support Network claimed the backdown was a reaction to a petition to the company to reinstate the account. 

In May 2013, PayPal declined to pay a reward offered in its Bug Bounty Program to a 17-year-old German student who had reported a cross-site scripting flaw on its site. The company wrote that the vulnerability had been previously reported, and chastised the youth for disclosing the issue to the public, but, uniquely, sent him a &quot;Letter of recognition&quot; for the discovery.

In August 2013, entrepreneurs who had used PayPal to collect the funds they raised on crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo reported difficulty in being able to withdraw the money. Startups included Proton Mail, Ouya, GlassUp (a rival to Google Glass), and Mailpile. This also extended to crowdfunded games like Yatagarasu: Attack on Cataclysm, Skullgirls and Dreamfall Chapters. 

In May 2014, PayPal blocked the account of a Russian human rights organisation &quot;RosUznik&quot;, which supported political prisoners arrested at Bolotnaya Square.

As of January 2015, a class-action lawsuit against PayPal was filed in Israel, claiming that they arbitrarily froze accounts and held funds for up to 180 days without paying interest and thereby directly profited from it. In the examples given in the lawsuit, PayPal had received complaints against small vendors which were later resolved, but the PayPal account was closed. The lawsuit requests that PayPal be declared a monopoly and thus regulated accordingly. 

In April 2015, The Guardian reported that PayPal had blocked the account of London-based human rights group Justice for Iran.

In May 2015, PayPal blocked an account intended to raise money for the production of print copies of Boris Nemtsov&#x27;s investigative report &quot;Putin. War&quot; on Russian military involvement in Ukraine. The explanation by PayPal was that &quot;PayPal does not offer the opportunity to use its system for collecting funds to finance the activities of political parties or for political aims in Russia&quot;, though PayPal&#x27;s &quot;Acceptable Use Policy&quot; does not mention financing for political goals. Non-governmental organization Freedom House issued a statement by Susan Corke, director or Eurasia Programs, saying, &quot;One of the Russian government’s most effective tactics for stifling criticism of President Putin and the government’s human rights abuses is to accuse critics of conducting ‘political activities’ and claiming them to be improper or illegal. It is disturbing, to say the least, that PayPal has supported those tactics by denying individuals the right to help pay for publishing ‘Putin. War,’ the work of murdered opposition figure Boris Nemtsov. PayPal should immediately lift this ban, to help, rather than hinder, press freedom in Russia.&quot;

In September 2015, PayPal reappeared as a payment processor at some newly legalized US online gambling sites operating in the state of New Jersey. Since the May 14, 2018, Supreme Court of the United States overturn of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, PayPal has been widely available to customers in states where sports betting has been legalized for both depositing and withdrawing money. 

By 2016, ConsumerAffairs had received over 1,200 consumer reviews of PayPal, resulting in an overall satisfaction rating of one star out of five for the company. Consumers have also launched numerous anti-PayPal Facebook pages and Twitter accounts to air their complaints.

In February 2017, PayPal froze the account of News Media Canada, a Canadian trade association, in response to a payment from The Reminder, a Flin Flon, Manitoba community newspaper, that was intended to cover the fee for the Reminder&#x27;s submission of articles for consideration in a nationwide journalism contest run by News Media Canada, including one discussing Syrian refugees. PayPal cited United States regulations as a reason for flagging the transaction between Canadian entities.

In September 2018, PayPal banned radio host Alex Jones and his website InfoWars, claiming that his site has content that is hateful and discriminatory against certain religious groups. 

PayPal discontinued payments to Pornhub models on November 14, 2019, alleging that &quot;Pornhub has made certain business payments through PayPal without seeking our permission&quot;. Pornhub criticized the decision as one that affected &quot;over a hundred thousand performers who rely on them for their livelihoods&quot; and steered its payees toward other payment options. 

In September 2020, PayPal issued new terms of service which introduced a fee for inactive accounts in 19 countries. PayPal sent its clients an email about the updated terms, but did not mention introducing such a fee.

PayPal faces criticism over its policy requiring that the name on a user account must match the account holder&#x27;s legal name, and that any user seeking to change the name on their account must provide government-issued photo identification. Trans and nonbinary users and rights advocates object because this means that any trans user whose preferred name differs from their legal name is forced to use their deadname instead. They say this is not only disrespectful, but also endangers trans users, because the name on the PayPal account is revealed to the payee whenever a user makes a payment, thereby outing the user and potentially exposing them to people who may harass or injure them. By contrast, other financial companies, such as MasterCard, have made it easier for trans and nonbinary users to change the names on their accounts.

In July 2021, PayPal announced a plan to collaborate with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Center on Extremism, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and several other nonprofits to analyze its users&#x27; transactions in order to investigate the finances of extremist and hate groups in the United States, and to share the results with law enforcement, policymakers, and other financial corporations. The ADL&#x27;s CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, stated that this initiative is meant to help &quot;mitigat[e] extremist threats.&quot; 

In September 2022, PayPal closed the accounts of the British social commentator Toby Young and two connected organisations: the Free Speech Union and The Daily Sceptic website. PayPal said that it closed the accounts because of breaches of its acceptable use policy, alleging misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. PayPal reversed the decision a few days later.

In October 2022, PayPal published an update to its Acceptable Use Policy that included a $2,500 fine for the accounts of users PayPal deemed to have been promoting misinformation. Former PayPal president David A. Marcus criticized the change, tweeting that &quot;PayPal&#x27;s new AUP goes against everything I believe in&quot;. Elon Musk, co-founder of X.comwhich merged with Confinity to form PayPalalso criticized the change. Following media scrutiny and criticism on social media, PayPal removed the updated policy from its website, stating, &quot;An AUP notice recently went out in error that included incorrect information. PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and this language was never intended to be inserted in our policy. Our teams are working to correct our policy pages.&quot;

== Litigation ==

In March 2002, two PayPal account holders separately sued the company for alleged violations of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) and California law. Most of the allegations concerned PayPal&#x27;s dispute resolution procedures. The two lawsuits were merged into one class-action lawsuit (In re: PayPal litigation). An informal settlement was reached in November 2003, and a formal settlement was signed on June 11, 2004. The settlement requires that PayPal change its business practices (including changing its dispute resolution procedures to make them EFTA-compliant) and make a US$9.25 million payment to members of the class. PayPal denied any wrongdoing.

In June 2003, Stamps.com filed a lawsuit against PayPal and eBay claiming breach of contract, breach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, and interference with contract, among other claims. In a 2002 license agreement, Stamps.com and PayPal agreed that Stamps.com technology would be made available to allow PayPal users to buy and print postage online from their PayPal accounts. Stamps.com claimed that PayPal did not live up to its contractual obligations and accused eBay of interfering with PayPal and Stamps.com&#x27;s agreement, hence Stamps.com&#x27;s reasoning for including eBay in the suit. 

Craig Comb and two others filed a class action against PayPal in &quot;Craig Comb, et al. v. PayPal Inc.&quot;, alleging illegal misappropriation of customer accounts, and detailing their customer service experiences, including the freezure of deposited funds for up to 180 days until dispute resolution by PayPal. PayPal argued that the plaintiffs were required to arbitrate their disputes under the American Arbitration Association&#x27;s Commercial Arbitration Rules. The court ruled against PayPal, stating that &quot;the User Agreement and arbitration clause are substantively unconscionable under California law.&quot;

In September 2002, Bank One Corporation sued PayPal for allegedly infringing its cardless payment system patents. The following year, PayPal countersued, claiming that Bank One&#x27;s online bill-payment system was an infringement against PayPal&#x27;s online bill-payment patent, issued in 1998. The two companies agreed on a settlement in October 2003. 

In November 2003, AT&amp;T Corporation filed suit against eBay and PayPal claiming that their payment systems infringed an AT&amp;T patent, filed in 1991 and granted in 1994. The case was settled out of court the following month, with the terms of the settlement undisclosed. 

In June 2011, PayPal and Israel Credit Cards, Ltd. (CAL)a credit card issuer subsidiary of Israel Discount Bankwere sued for NIS ₪16 million. The claimants accused PayPal of deliberately failing to notify its customers that CAL was illegally charging them for currency conversion fees.

A class-action lawsuit filed in 2010, in which the plaintiffs contested PayPal&#x27;s &quot;holds&quot; on funds, was settled in 2016.

PayPal has proposed a settlement in the amount of US$3.2 million in &quot;Zepeda v. PayPal&quot; which has yet to be ratified. As part of the settlement proposal, the company agreed to change some of its policies.

In 2017, following a class action lawsuit between PayPal and its users over unexplained account closures, a settlement agreement was reachedand granted final approval by a federal judgein which PayPal agreed to pay the class US$4 million, modify the disclosure of its reserve and hold practices, and clarify its dispute resolution process.

In January 2022, a class-action lawsuit was filed against PayPal that claims the company froze accounts without providing adequate explanation, or for arbitrary reasons, and that PayPal told account holders they would &quot;have to get a subpoena&quot; to learn why their accounts were frozen. The lawsuit alleges that PayPal also confiscated funds for itself after 180 days, violating both the RICO Act and PayPal&#x27;s own policies.

=== CFPB consent ===

On 21 May 2015, PayPal agreed that PayPal Credit would pay a US$25 million fine to settle a complaint filed in federal court by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The complaint alleged that consumers using PayPal were signed up for PayPal credit accounts without their knowledge or consent, that PayPal had promised discounts and payment options the consumers never received, and that users trying to sign up for the regular, non-credit, PayPal accounts were signed up for credit accounts instead. The complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, which ordered PayPal Credit to refund $15 million to consumers and to pay a $10 million fine.
