<text>The Battle of the Falkland Islands was a First World War naval action between the British Royal Navy and Imperial German Navy on 8 December 1914 in the South Atlantic. The British, after their defeat at the Battle of Coronel on 1 November, sent a large force to track down and destroy the German cruiser squadron. The battle is commemorated every year on 8 December in the Falkland Islands as a public holiday.

Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee commanding the German squadron of two armoured cruisers, and , the light cruisers , and , and the colliers SS &quot;Baden&quot;, SS &quot;Santa Isabel&quot;, and SS &quot;Seydlitz&quot; attempted to raid the British supply base at Stanley in the Falkland Islands. The British squadron consisting of the battlecruisers and , the armoured cruisers , and , the armed merchant cruiser HMS &quot;Macedonia&quot; and the light cruisers and had arrived in the port the day before.

Visibility was at its maximum, the sea was placid with a gentle breeze, and the day was bright and sunny. The vanguard cruisers of the German squadron were detected early. By nine o&#x27;clock that morning, the British battlecruisers and cruisers were in pursuit of the German vessels. All except &quot;Dresden&quot; and &quot;Seydlitz&quot; were tracked down and sunk.

==Background==

The British battlecruisers each mounted eight guns, whereas Spee&#x27;s best ships (&quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;) were equipped with eight pieces. Additionally, the battlecruisers could make against Spee&#x27;s ; thus, the British battlecruisers not only significantly outgunned their opponents, but could outrun them too. The obsolete pre-dreadnought battleship had been grounded at Stanley to act as a makeshift defence battery for the area.

===Spee&#x27;s squadron===
At the outbreak of hostilities, the German East Asia Squadron commanded by Spee was outclassed and outgunned by the Royal Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy. Spee and the High Command did not believe Germany&#x27;s Asian possessions could be defended and doubted the squadron could even survive in that theatre. Spee wanted to get his ships home and began by heading southeast across the Pacific, although he was pessimistic about their chances.

Spee&#x27;s fleet won the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Coronel, Chile, on 1 November 1914, where his ships sank the cruisers (Admiral Cradock&#x27;s flagship) and . After the battle, on 3 November, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; entered Valparaíso harbour and were welcomed as heroes by the German population. Von Spee declined to join in the celebrations; when presented with a bouquet of flowers, he refused them, commenting that &quot;these will do nicely for my grave&quot;. As required under international law for belligerent ships in neutral countries, the ships left within 24 hours, moving to Mas Afuera, off the Chilean coast. There they received news of the loss of the cruiser , which had previously detached from the squadron and had been raiding in the Indian Ocean. They also learnt of the fall of the German colony at Qingdao in China, which had been their home port. On 15 November, the squadron moved to Bahia San Quintin on the Chilean coast, where a ceremony was held to award 300 Iron Crosses, second class, to crew members, and an Iron Cross first class to Admiral Spee, after news of the battle reached Kaiser Wilhelm II in Berlin.

Spee&#x27;s officers counseled a return to Germany. The squadron had used half its ammunition at Coronel; the supply could not be replenished, and it was difficult even to obtain coal. Intelligence reports suggested that the British ships , &quot;Cornwall&quot; and &quot;Carnarvon&quot; were stationed in the River Plate, and that there had been no British warships at Stanley when recently visited by a steamer. Spee had been concerned about reports of a British battleship, &quot;Canopus&quot;, but its location was unknown. On 26 November, the squadron set sail for Cape Horn, which they reached on 1 December, then anchored at Picton Island, where they stayed for three days distributing coal from a captured British collier, the &quot;Drummuir&quot;, and hunting. On 6 December, the British vessel was scuttled and its crew transferred to the auxiliary &quot;Seydlitz&quot;. The same day Spee proposed to raid the Falkland Islands in order to destroy the British wireless transmitter located there before setting course for Germany. The raid was unnecessary because the squadron now had as much coal as it could carry. Most of Spee&#x27;s captains opposed the raid, but he nevertheless decided to proceed.

===British preparations===

On 30 October, retired Admiral of the Fleet Sir John Fisher was reappointed First Sea Lord to replace Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg, who had been forced to resign because of public outcry against a perceived German prince running the British navy, though Louis had been British and in the Royal Navy since the age of 14. On 3 November, Fisher was advised that Spee had been sighted off Valparaíso and acted to reinforce Cradock by ordering &quot;Defence&quot;, already sent to patrol the eastern coast of South America, to reinforce his squadron. On 4 November, news of the defeat at Coronel arrived. The blow to British naval prestige was palpable, and the British public was rather shocked. As a result, the battlecruisers &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; were ordered to leave the Grand Fleet and sail to Plymouth for overhaul and preparation for service abroad. The Chief of Staff at the Admiralty was Vice-Admiral Doveton Sturdee. Fisher had a long-standing disagreement with Sturdee, who had been one of those calling for his earlier dismissal as First Sea Lord in 1911, so he took the opportunity to appoint Sturdee Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic and Pacific, to command the new squadron from &quot;Invincible&quot;.

On 11 November, &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; left HMNB Devonport, although repairs to &quot;Invincible&quot; were incomplete and she sailed with workmen still aboard. Despite the urgency of the situation and their maximum speed of around , the ships were forced to cruise at to conserve coal in order to complete the long journey south across the Atlantic. The two ships were also heavily loaded with supplies. Although secrecy of the mission was considered important so as to surprise Spee, Lieutenant Hirst from &quot;Glasgow&quot; heard locals discussing the forthcoming arrival of the ships while ashore at Cape Verde on 17 November; however the news did not reach Spee. Sturdee arrived at the Abrolhos Rocks on 26 November, where Rear-Admiral Archibald Peile Stoddart awaited him with the remainder of the squadron.

Sturdee announced his intention to depart for the Falkland Islands on 29 November. From there, the fast light cruisers &quot;Glasgow&quot; and &quot;Bristol&quot; would patrol seeking Spee, summoning reinforcements if they found him. Captain John Luce of &quot;Glasgow&quot;, who had been at the Battle of Coronel, objected that there was no need to wait so long and persuaded Sturdee to depart a day early. The squadron was delayed during the journey for 12 hours when a cable towing targets for practice-firing became wrapped around one of &quot;Invincible&quot;″s propellers, but the ships arrived on the morning of 7 December. The two light cruisers moored in the inner part of Stanley Harbour, while the larger ships remained in the deeper outer harbour of Port William. Divers set about removing the offending cable from &quot;Invincible&quot;; &quot;Cornwall&quot;&#x27;s boiler fires were extinguished to make repairs, and &quot;Bristol&quot; had one of her engines dismantled. The famous ship —reduced to a coal bunker—supplied coal to &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot;. The armed merchant cruiser &quot;Macedonia&quot; was ordered to patrol the harbour, while &quot;Kent&quot; maintained steam in her boilers, ready to replace &quot;Macedonia&quot; the next day, 8 December; Spee&#x27;s fleet arrived in the morning of the same day.

An unlikely source of intelligence on the movement of the German ships was from Mrs Muriel Felton, wife of the manager of a sheep station at Fitzroy, and her maids Christina Goss and Marian Macleod. They were alone when Felton received a telephone call from Port Stanley advising that German ships were approaching the islands. The maids took turns riding to the top of a nearby hill to record the movements of the ships, which Felton relayed to Port Stanley by telephone. Her reports allowed &quot;Bristol&quot; and &quot;Macedonia&quot; to take up the best positions to intercept. The Admiralty later presented the women with silver plates and Felton received an OBE for her actions.

==Battle==

===Opening moves===

Spee&#x27;s cruisers—&quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Nürnberg&quot;—approached Stanley first. At the time, most of British fleet was coaling, but under short notice to steam. Some believe that had Spee pressed the attack, Sturdee&#x27;s ships would have been easy targets, although this is a subject of conjecture as two ships were under steam acting as guardships and the battleship &quot;Canopus&quot; was also present. The Germans were surprised by gunfire from an unexpected source - the &quot;Canopus&quot;, which had been grounded as a guardship and was behind a hill. This was enough to check the Germans&#x27; advance. The sight of the distinctive tripod masts of the British battlecruisers confirmed that they were facing a better-equipped enemy. HMS &quot;Kent&quot; was already making her way out of the harbor and had been ordered to pursue Spee&#x27;s ships.

Made aware of the German ships, Sturdee had ordered the crews to breakfast, knowing that &quot;Canopus&quot; had bought them time while steam was raised.

To Spee, with his crew battle-weary and his ships outgunned, the outcome seemed inevitable. Realizing his danger too late, and having lost any chance to attack the British ships while they were at anchor, Spee and his squadron dashed for the open sea. The British left port around 10:00. Spee was ahead by , with the German ships in line abreast heading southeast, but there was plenty of daylight left for the faster battlecruisers to catch up.

===Contact===
It was 13:00 when the British battlecruisers opened fire, but it took them half an hour to get the range of SMS &quot;Leipzig&quot;. Realising that he could not outrun the British ships, Spee decided to engage them with his armoured cruisers alone, to give the light cruisers a chance to escape. He turned to fight just after 13:20. The German armoured cruisers had the advantage of a freshening north-west breeze, which caused the funnel smoke of the British ships to obscure their target practically throughout the action. &quot;Gneisenau&#x27;s&quot; second-in-command Hans Pochhammer indicated that there was a long respite for the Germans during the early stages of the battle, as the British attempted unsuccessfully to force Admiral Spee away from his advantageous position.

Despite initial success by &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; in striking &quot;Invincible&quot;, the British capital ships suffered little damage. Spee then turned to escape, but the battlecruisers came within extreme firing range 40 minutes later.

HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; and HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot; engaged &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, while Sturdee detached his cruisers to chase SMS &quot;Leipzig&quot; and SMS &quot;Nürnberg&quot;.

HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; and HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot; turned to fire broadsides at the armoured cruisers and Spee responded by trying to close the range. His flagship SMS &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; took extensive damage with funnels flattened, fires and a list. The list became worse at 16:04, and she sank by 16:17, taking von Spee and the entire crew with her. SMS &quot;Gneisenau&quot; continued to fire and evade until 17:15, by which time her ammunition had been exhausted, and she sank at 18:02. During her death throes, Admiral Sturdee continued to engage SMS &quot;Gneisenau&quot; with his two battlecruisers and the cruiser HMS &quot;Carnarvon&quot;, rather than detaching one of the battlecruisers to hunt down the escaping &quot;Dresden&quot;. One hundred and ninety of SMS &quot;Gneisenau&quot;&#x27;s crew were rescued from the water. Both of the British battlecruisers had received about 40 hits between them from the German ships, with one crewman killed and four injured.

Meanwhile, SMS &quot;Nürnberg&quot; and SMS &quot;Leipzig&quot; had run from the British cruisers. SMS &quot;Nürnberg&quot; was running at full speed but in need of maintenance, while the crew of the pursuing HMS &quot;Kent&quot; were pushing her boilers and engines to the limit. SMS &quot;Nürnberg&quot; finally turned for battle at 17:30. HMS &quot;Kent&quot; had the advantage in shell weight and armour. SMS &quot;Nürnberg&quot; suffered two boiler explosions around 18:30, giving the advantage in speed and manoeuvrability to HMS &quot;Kent&quot;. The German ship then rolled over and sank at 19:27 after a long chase. The cruisers HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; and HMS &quot;Cornwall&quot; had chased down SMS &quot;Leipzig&quot;; HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; closed to finish SMS &quot;Leipzig,&quot; which had run out of ammunition but was still flying her battle ensign. SMS &quot;Leipzig&quot; fired two flares, so HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; ceased fire. At 21:23, more than southeast of the Falklands, she also rolled over and sank, leaving only 18 survivors.

During the course of the main battles, Sturdee had despatched Captain Fanshawe on HMS &quot;Bristol&quot;, together with HMS &quot;Macedonia&quot;, to destroy the colliers. &quot;Baden&quot; and &quot;Santa Isabel&quot; were chased, stopped, and (after removing the crews) sunk by HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; and HMS &quot;Macedonia&quot; at 19:00. &quot;Seydlitz&quot; had taken a separate course and escaped.

==Outcome==
Casualties and damage were extremely disproportionate; the British suffered only very lightly. Admiral Spee and his two sons were among the German dead. Two hundred and fifteen Germans became prisoners on the British ships. Most were from the &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, with nine from &quot;Nürnberg&quot; and 18 from &quot;Leipzig&quot;. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was lost with all hands. One of &quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s officers who lived had been the sole survivor on three different guns on the battered cruiser. He was pulled from the water saying he was a first cousin of the British commander (Stoddart).

Of the known German force of eight ships, two escaped: the auxiliary &quot;Seydlitz&quot; and the light cruiser &quot;Dresden&quot;, which remained at large for a further three months before she was cornered by a British squadron (&quot;Kent&quot;, &quot;Glasgow&quot; and &quot;Orama&quot;) off the Juan Fernández Islands on 14 March 1915. After a short battle, &quot;Dresden&#x27;s&quot; captain evacuated his ship and scuttled her by detonating the main ammunition magazine.

As a consequence of the battle, the East Asia Squadron, Germany&#x27;s only permanent overseas naval formation, effectively ceased to exist. Commerce raiding on the high seas by regular warships of the Kaiserliche Marine was brought to an end. However, Germany put several armed merchant vessels into service as commerce raiders until the end of the war (for example, see Felix von Luckner).

==British intelligence during the battle==

After the battle, German naval experts were baffled at why Admiral Spee attacked the base and how the two squadrons could have met so coincidentally in so many thousand miles of open waters. Kaiser Wilhelm&#x27;s handwritten note on the official report of the battle reads: &quot;It remains a mystery what made Spee attack the Falkland Islands. See &#x27;Mahan&#x27;s Naval Strategy&#x27;.&quot;

It was generally believed Spee was misled by the German admiralty into attacking the Falklands, a Royal Naval fuelling base, after receiving intelligence from the German wireless station at Valparaiso which reported the port free of Royal Navy warships. Despite the objection of three of his ships&#x27; captains, Spee proceeded to attack.

However, in 1925 a German naval officer and senior Kriegsmarine spy, Franz von Rintelen, interviewed Admiral William Reginald Hall, Director of the Admiralty&#x27;s Naval Intelligence Division (NID), and was informed that Spee&#x27;s squadron had been lured towards the British battlecruisers by means of a fake signal sent in a German naval code broken by British cryptographers and sent on a purloined German telegraph form. (Similarly, on 14 March 1915, was intercepted by British ships while taking on coal at sea in a location identified by NID codebreakers.)

The wreck of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was discovered on 4 December 2019, approximately southeast of Stanley at a depth of .

<text>HMS &quot;Good Hope&quot; was one of four &quot;Drake&quot;-class armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy around 1900; she was originally named &quot;Africa&quot;, but was renamed before she was launched. She became flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet in 1906, and was the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in 1908. She was reduced to reserve in 1913, but was recommissioned in mid-1914.

When war was declared in August 1914, &quot;Good Hope&quot; was ordered to reinforce the 4th Cruiser Squadron and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock. Cradock moved the available ships of his squadron later that month to the coast of South America to search for German commerce raiders.

He was then ordered further south to the Strait of Magellan to block any attempt of the German East Asia Squadron to penetrate into the South Atlantic. He found the German squadron on 1 November off the coast of Chile. The German squadron outnumbered Cradock&#x27;s force and were individually more powerful; they sank Cradock&#x27;s two armoured cruisers in the Battle of Coronel, both, including &quot;Good Hope&quot;, being lost with all hands.

==Design and description==
&quot;Good Hope&quot; was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by 43 Belleville boilers. She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 900 officers and ratings.

Her main armament consisted of two breech-loading (BL) Mk X guns in single gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Her secondary armament of sixteen BL 6-inch Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships. Eight of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. A dozen quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. Two additional 12-pounder 8 cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore. &quot;Good Hope&quot; also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged  torpedo tubes.

The ship&#x27;s waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of and was closed off by transverse bulkheads. The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while the casemate armour was 5 inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour.

==Service==

&quot;Good Hope&quot;, named after the British colony on the Cape of Good Hope, was laid down on 11 September 1899 with the name of &quot;Africa&quot; by Fairfield Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering at their Govan shipyard. She was renamed &quot;Good Hope&quot; on 2 October and launched on 21 February 1901, when she was formally named by Mrs. (Ethel) Elgar, wife of Francis Elgar, manager of the shipbuilding company. She arrived in Portsmouth to be completed and armed in late December 1901. Captain Charles Edward Madden was appointed in command for her first commission on 8 November 1902.

She was to be commissioned as flagship of Rear-Admiral Wilmot Fawkes as he succeeded as commander of the Cruiser Squadron in the Home Fleet, but was ordered first to convey Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, to South Africa in late 1902. Fawkes hoisted his flag on 23 November, and the ship left Portsmouth with Chamberlain and his wife on board two days later. During the outward voyage, the &quot;Good Hope&quot; docked at Port Said, Suez, Aden, Mombasa, and Zanzibar, before landing Chamberlain at Durban in late December. After staying through Christmas at Port Elizabeth, she visited Simon&#x27;s Town before returning home along the West Coast of Africa. Leaving Cape Town on 22 January 1903, she docked several places and returned in February, then joined her sister ship HMS &quot;Drake&quot; cruising with the Mediterranean squadron until May 1903.

In 1906 she became the flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron, Atlantic Fleet and was the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron when she visited South Africa two years later. &quot;Good Hope&quot; was placed in reserve in 1913.

&quot;Good Hope&quot; was re-commissioned in mid-1914 with a crew composed mainly of naval reservists and was briefly assigned to the 6th Cruiser Squadron in August, before being transferring the 4th Cruiser Squadron. She rendezvoused at the old Royal Naval Dockyard (which had closed in 1905 and transferred to the Dominion government to become Her Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Dockyard) in the former Imperial fortress of Halifax, Nova Scotia (which had replaced the Bermuda-based squadron of the North America and West Indies Station in 1907), with HMS Suffolk, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock. Cradock transferred his flag to &quot;Good Hope&quot; because she was faster than his previous flagship. In Halifax, the crew of &quot;Good Hope&quot; was joined by four young Canadian midshipmen to assist Cradock with his command. They would become the first Royal Canadian Navy casualties of the First World War.

Cradock&#x27;s command was despatched to the coast of South America later that month at his own suggestion to better hunt for the German ships preying upon British merchant ships. &quot;Good Hope&quot; was coaled at the Royal Naval Dockyard in the North Atlantic Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda (by Bermuda Militia Artillery gunners assisting with coaling). On the way south, &quot;Good Hope&#x27;s&quot; crew was strengthened by the recruitment of 26 stokers in the West Indies, probably in St. Lucia. His ships were generally unsuccessful in this and he moved his squadron further south in late September to search for the East Asia Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee, in the vicinity of Cape Horn and the Strait of Magellan in accordance to his orders from the Admiralty.

At the end of September, Cradock made his first fruitless search of the Tierra del Fuego area and later detached three of his ships to search up the Chilean coast, reaching Valparaíso on 15 October, while &quot;Good Hope&quot; returned to Port Stanley, in the Falkland Islands, to recoal and to reestablish communications with the Admiralty. He received word on 7 October that Spee&#x27;s ships were definitely bound for the Cape Horn region and waited for the elderly predreadnought battleship to reinforce his squadron. She was in poor mechanical condition when she arrived at Port Stanley and required time to make repairs. &quot;Good Hope&quot; sailed on 22 October without her, going around Cape Horn, while &quot;Canopus&quot; and three colliers departed the following day, taking the shorter route through the Strait of Magellan.
===Battle of Coronel===

&quot;Good Hope&quot; rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron at Vallenar Roads in the remote Chonos Archipelago of Chile on 27 October to recoal. They departed two days later, just as &quot;Canopus&quot; arrived, Cradock ordering the battleship to follow as soon as possible. He sent the light cruiser to scout ahead and to enter Coronel, Chile, to pick up any messages from the Admiralty and acquire intelligence regarding German activities. The cruiser began to pick up German radio signals from the light cruiser on the afternoon of 29 October, and delayed entering Coronel for two days with Cradock&#x27;s permission to avoid being trapped by the fast German ships. A German supply ship was already there and radioed Spee that &quot;Glasgow&quot; had entered the harbour around twilight. The cruiser departed on the morning of 1 November, but Spee had already made plans to catch her when informed of her presence the previous evening.

&quot;Glasgow&quot; departed Coronel at 09:15 after having picked up the squadron&#x27;s mail and rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron four hours later. Cradock ordered his ships to form line abreast with an interval of between ships to maximise visibility at 13:50, and steered north at a speed of . At 16:17 &quot;Leipzig&quot; spotted &quot;Glasgow&quot;, the easternmost British ship, to its west and she spotted &quot;Leipzig&quot;″s funnel smoke three minutes later. At 17:10 Cradock ordered his ships to head for &quot;Glasgow&quot;, the closest ship to the Germans. Once gathered together, he formed them into line astern, with &quot;Good Hope&quot; in the lead, steering southeasterly at at 18:18. As the sixteen guns aboard the armoured cruisers &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and were only matched by the two 9.2-inch guns on his flagship, he needed to close the range to bring his more numerous 6-inch guns to bear. The Force 7 winds and high seas, however, prevented the use of half of those guns as they were too close to the water. He also wanted to use the setting sun to his advantage so that its light would blind the German gunners. Spee was well aware of the British advantages and refused to allow Cradock to close the range. His ships were faster than the British, slowed by the 16-knot maximum speed of the armed merchant cruiser , and he opened up the range to until conditions changed to suit him. The sun set at 18:50, which silhouetted the British ships against the light sky while the German ships became indistinguishable from the shoreline behind them.

Spee immediately turned to close and signalled his ships to open fire at 19:04 when the range closed to . Spee&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, engaged &quot;Good Hope&quot; while &quot;Gneisenau&quot; fired at &quot;Monmouth&quot;. Cradock&#x27;s flagship was hit on the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s third salvo, when shells knocked out her forward 9.2-inch turret and set her forecastle on fire. Cradock, knowing his only chance was to close the range, continued to do so despite the battering that Spee&#x27;s ships inflicted. By 19:23 the range was almost half of that when the battle began and the British ships bore onwards. Spee tried to open the range, fearing a torpedo attack, but the British were only away at 19:35. Seven minutes later, &quot;Good Hope&quot; charged directly at the German ships, although they dodged out of her way. Spee ordered his armoured cruisers to concentrate their fire on the British flagship and she soon drifted to a halt with her topsides all aflame. At 19:50 her forward magazine exploded, severing the bow from the rest of the ship, and she later sank in the darkness. Spee estimated that his flagship had made 35 hits on &quot;Good Hope&quot;, suffering only two hits in return that did no significant damage and failed even to wound one crewman. &quot;Good Hope&quot; was sunk with all hands, a total of 926 officers and ratings. Four of the midshipmen aboard the ship were the first casualties of the newly formed Royal Canadian Navy.

<text>The Sieg () is a river in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is a right tributary of the Rhine.

The river is named after the Sicambri. It is in length.

The source is located in the Rothaargebirge mountains. From here the river runs southwestwards to the city of Siegen and the hills of Siegerland, both named after the river. Further west the Sieg valley forms the boundary of the Bergisches Land (northern) and Westerwald (southern). The river finally runs through a protected area east of the city of Bonn.

After passing the cities of Hennef and Siegburg, the river flows into the Rhine at the &quot;Naturschutzgebiet Siegaue&quot;, a protected area immediately to the northeast of the city of Bonn, near Niederkassel/.

==Sieg Spring==
The Sieg Spring (), the source of the Sieg, is at an elevation of , near the village of , North Rhine-Westphalia. The location was restored in 2013.

<doc id="191395" wikidata="Q175089" url="?curid=191395" title="Jade">
<text>Jade is an umbrella term for two different types of decorative rocks used for jewelry or ornaments. Jade is often referred to by either of two different silicate mineral names: nephrite (a silicate of calcium and magnesium in the amphibole group of minerals), or jadeite (a silicate of sodium and aluminum in the pyroxene group of minerals). Nephrite is typically green, although may be yellow, white or black. Jadeite varies from white or near-colorless, through various shades of green (including an emerald green, termed &#x27;imperial&#x27;), to lavender, yellow, orange, brown and black. Rarely it may be blue.
Both of these names refer to their use as gemstones, and each has a mineralogically more specific name. Both the amphibole jade (nephrite) and pyroxene jade are mineral aggregates (rocks) rather than mineral species. 

Nephrite was deprecated by the International Mineralogical Association as a mineral species name in 1978 (replaced by tremolite). The name &quot;nephrite&quot; is mineralogically correct for referring to the rock. Jadeite is a legitimate mineral species, differing from the pyroxene jade rock. In China, the name jadeite has been replaced with &quot;fei cui&quot;, the traditional Chinese name for this gem that was in use long before Damour created the name in 1863.

Jade is well known for its ornamental use in East Asian, South Asian, and Southeast Asian art. It is commonly used in Latin America, such as Mexico and Guatemala. The use of jade in Mesoamerica for symbolic and ideological ritual was influenced by its rarity and value among pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Olmecs, the Maya, and other ancient civilizations of the Valley of Mexico.

Jade is classified into three main types: Type A, Type B, and Type C. Type A jade refers to natural, untreated jadeite jade, prized for its purity and vibrant colors. It is the most valuable and sought-after type, often characterized by its vivid green hues and high translucency. Type A jade is revered for its symbolism of purity, harmony, and protection in various cultures, especially in East Asia where it holds significant cultural and spiritual importance. Types B and C have been enhanced with resin and colourant respectively.

==Etymology==

The English word &quot;jade&quot; is derived (via French and Latin &#x27;flanks, kidney area&#x27;) from the Spanish term (first recorded in 1565) or &#x27;loin stone&#x27;, from its reputed efficacy in curing ailments of the loins and kidneys. &quot;Nephrite&quot; is derived from , a Latin translation of the Spanish .

==History==
===East Asia===
====Prehistoric and historic China====
During Neolithic times, the key known sources of nephrite jade in China for utilitarian and ceremonial jade items were the now-depleted deposits in the Ningshao area in the Yangtze River Delta (Liangzhu culture 3400–2250 BC) and in an area of the Liaoning province and Inner Mongolia (Hongshan culture 4700–2200 BC). Dushan Jade (a rock composed largely of anorthite feldspar and zoisite) was being mined as early as 6000 BC. In the Yin Ruins of the Shang Dynasty (1600 to 1050 BC) in Anyang, Dushan Jade ornaments were unearthed in the tomb of the Shang kings.

Jade was considered to be the &quot;imperial gem&quot; and was used to create many utilitarian and ceremonial objects, from indoor decorative items to jade burial suits. From the earliest Chinese dynasties to the present, the jade deposits most used were not only those of Khotan in the Western Chinese province of Xinjiang but other parts of China as well, such as Lantian, Shaanxi. There, white and greenish nephrite jade is found in small quarries and as pebbles and boulders in the rivers flowing from the Kuen-Lun mountain range eastward into the Takla-Makan desert area. The river jade collection is concentrated in the Yarkand, the White Jade (Yurungkash) and Black Jade (Karakash) Rivers. From the Kingdom of Khotan, on the southern leg of the Silk Road, yearly tribute payments consisting of the most precious white jade were made to the Chinese Imperial court and there worked into &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; by skilled artisans as jade had a status-value exceeding that of gold or silver. Jade became a favourite material for the crafting of Chinese scholars&#x27; objects, such as rests for calligraphy brushes, as well as the mouthpieces of some opium pipes, due to the belief that breathing through jade would bestow longevity upon smokers who used such a pipe.

Jadeite, with its bright emerald-green, lavender, pink, orange, yellow, red, black, white, near-colorless and brown colors was imported from Burma to China in quantity only after about 1800. The vivid white to green variety became known as &quot;fei cui&quot; (翡翠) or kingfisher jade, due to its resemblance to the feathers of the kingfisher bird. That definition was later expanded to include all other colors that the rock is found in. It quickly became almost as popular as nephrite and a favorite of Qing Dynasty&#x27;s aristocracy, while scholars still had strong attachment to nephrite (white jade, or Hetian jade), which they deemed to be the symbol of a nobleman.

In the history of the art of the Chinese empire, jade has had a special significance, comparable with that of gold and diamonds in the West. Jade was used for the finest objects and cult figures, and for grave furnishings for high-ranking members of the imperial family. Due to that significance and the rising middle class in China, in 2010 the finest jade when found in nuggets of &quot;mutton fat&quot; jade – so-named for its marbled white consistency – could sell for $3,000 an ounce, a tenfold increase from a decade previously.

The Chinese character 玉 (yù) is used to denote the several types of stone known in English as &quot;jade&quot; (e.g. 玉器, jadewares), such as jadeite (硬玉, &#x27;hard jade&#x27;, another name for 翡翠) and nephrite (軟玉, &#x27;soft jade&#x27;). While still in use, the terms &quot;hard jade&quot; and &quot;soft jade&quot; resulted from a mistranslation by a Japanese geologist, and should be avoided.

But because of the value added culturally to jades throughout Chinese history, the word has also come to refer more generally to precious or ornamental stones, and is very common in more symbolic usage as in phrases like 拋磚引玉/抛砖引玉 (lit. &quot;casting a brick (i.e. the speaker&#x27;s own words) to draw a jade (i.e. pearls of wisdom from the other party)&quot;), 玉容 (a beautiful face; &quot;jade countenance&quot;), and 玉立 (slim and graceful; &quot;jade standing upright&quot;). The character has a similar range of meanings when appearing as a radical as parts of other characters.

==== Prehistoric and historic Japan ====
Jade in Japan was used for jade bracelets. It was a symbol of wealth and power. Leaders also used jade in rituals. It is the national stone of Japan.
Examples of use in Japan can be traced back to the early Jomon period about 7,000 years ago. XRF analysis results have revealed that all jade used in Japan since the Jomon period is from Itoigawa.
The jade culture that blossomed in ancient Japan respected green ones, and jade of other colors was not used. There is a theory that the reason why the meaning is that it was believed that the color of green enables the reproduction of fertility, the life, and the soul of the earth.

==== Prehistoric and historic Korea ====

The use of jade and other greenstone was a long-term tradition in Korea ( – AD 668). Jade is found in small numbers of pit-houses and burials. The craft production of small comma-shaped and tubular &quot;jades&quot; using materials such as jade, microcline, jasper, etc., in southern Korea originates from the Middle Mumun Pottery Period (–550 BC). Comma-shaped jades are found on some of the gold crowns of Silla royalty (/400–668 AD) and sumptuous elite burials of the Korean Three Kingdoms. After the state of Silla united the Korean Peninsula in 668, the widespread popularisation of death rituals related to Buddhism resulted in the decline of the use of jade in burials as prestige mortuary goods.

===South Asia===
====India====

The Jain temple of Kolanpak in the Nalgonda district, Telangana, India is home to a high sculpture of Mahavira that is carved entirely out of jade. India is also noted for its craftsman tradition of using large amounts of green serpentine or &quot;false jade&quot; obtained primarily from Afghanistan in order to fashion jewellery and ornamental items such as sword hilts and dagger handles.

The Salar Jung Museum in Hyderabad has a wide range of jade hilted daggers, mostly owned by the former Sultans of Hyderabad.

===Southeast Asia===
====Myanmar====
Today, it is estimated that Myanmar is the origin of upwards of 70% of the world&#x27;s supply of high-quality jadeite. Most of the jadeite mined in Myanmar is not cut for use in Myanmar, instead being transported to other nations, primarily in Asia, for use in jewelry and other products. The jadeite deposits found in Kachinland, in Myanmar&#x27;s northern regions is the highest quality jadeite in the world, considered precious by sources in China going as far back as the 10th century.
Jadeite in Myanmar is primarily found in the &quot;Jade Tract&quot; located in Lonkin Township in Kachin State in northern Myanmar which encompasses the alluvial region of the Uyu River between the 25th and 26th parallels. Present-day extraction of jade in this region occurs at the Phakant-gyi, Maw Sisa, Tin Tin, and Khansee mines. Khansee is also the only mine that produces maw sit sit, a kosmochlor-rich jade rock. Mines at Tawmaw and Hweka are mostly exhausted. From 1964 to 1981, mining was exclusively an enterprise of the Myanmar government. In 1981, 1985, and 1995, the Gemstone laws were modified to allow increasing private enterprise. In addition to this region, there are also notable mines in the neighboring Sagaing District, near the towns of Nasibon and Natmaw and Hkamti. Sagaing is a district in Myanmar proper, not a part of the ethic Kachin State.

====Southeast Asia====
Carved nephrite jade was the main commodity trade of an extensive prehistoric trading network connecting multiple areas in Southeast Asia. The nephrite jade was mined in eastern Taiwan by the animist Taiwanese indigenous peoples and processed mostly in the Philippines by the animist indigenous Filipinos. Some were also processed in Vietnam, while the peoples of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand also participated in the massive animist-led nephrite jade trading network, where other commodities were also traded. Participants in the network at the time had a majority animist population. The maritime road is one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world. It was in existence for at least 3,000 years, where its peak production was from 2000 BCE to 500 CE, older than the Silk Road in mainland Eurasia. It began to wane during its final centuries from 500 CE until 1000 CE. The entire period of the network was a golden age for the diverse animist societies of the region.

===Others===
====Māori====

Nephrite jade in New Zealand is known as &quot;pounamu&quot; in the Māori language (often called &quot;greenstone&quot; in New Zealand English), and plays an important role in Māori culture. It is considered a &quot;taonga&quot;, or treasure, and therefore protected under the Treaty of Waitangi, and the exploitation of it is restricted and closely monitored. It is found only in the South Island of New Zealand, known as &quot;Te Wai Pounamu&quot; in Māori—&quot;The [land of] Greenstone Water&quot;, or &quot;Te Wahi Pounamu&quot;—&quot;The Place of Greenstone&quot;.

Pounamu taonga increase in &quot;mana&quot; (prestige) as they pass from one generation to another. The most prized taonga are those with known histories going back many generations. These are believed to have their own mana and were often given as gifts to seal important agreements.

Tools, weapons and ornaments were made of it; in particular adzes, the &#x27;mere&#x27; (short club), and the hei-tiki (neck pendant). Nephrite jewellery of Maori design is widely popular with locals and tourists, although some of the jade used for these is now imported from British Columbia and elsewhere.

Pounamu taonga include tools such as toki (adzes), whao (chisels), whao whakakōka (gouges), ripi pounamu (knives), scrapers, awls, hammer stones, and drill points. Hunting tools include matau (fishing hooks) and lures, spear points, and kākā poria (leg rings for fastening captive birds); weapons such as mere (short handled clubs); and ornaments such as pendants (hei-tiki, hei matau and pekapeka), ear pendants (kuru and kapeu), and cloak pins.
Functional pounamu tools were widely worn for both practical and ornamental reasons, and continued to be worn as purely ornamental pendants (hei kakï) even after they were no longer used as tools.

====Mesoamerica====

Jade was a rare and valued material in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. The only source from which the various indigenous cultures, such as the Olmec and Maya, could obtain jade was located in the Motagua River valley in Guatemala. Jade was largely an elite good, and was usually carved in various ways, whether serving as a medium upon which hieroglyphs were inscribed, or shaped into symbolic figurines. Generally, the material was highly symbolic, and it was often employed in the performance of ideological practices and rituals.

====Canada====
Jade was first identified in Canada by Chinese settlers in 1886 in British Columbia. At this time jade was considered worthless because the settlers were searching for gold. Jade was not commercialized in Canada until the 1970s. The mining business Loex James Ltd., which was started by two Californians, began commercial mining of Canadian jade in 1972.

Mining is done from large boulders that contain bountiful deposits of jade. Jade is exposed using diamond-tipped core drills in order to extract samples. This is done to ensure that the jade meets requirements. Hydraulic spreaders are then inserted into cleavage points in the rock so that the jade can be broken away. Once the boulders are removed and the jade is accessible, it is broken down into more manageable 10-tonne pieces using water-cooled diamond saws. The jade is then loaded onto trucks and transported to the proper storage facilities.

====Russia====
Russia imported jade from China for a long time, but in the 1860s its own jade deposits were found in Siberia. Today, the main deposits of jade are located in Eastern Siberia, but jade is also extracted in the Polar Urals and in the Krasnoyarsk territory (Kantegirskoye and Kurtushibinskoye deposits). Russian raw jade reserves are estimated at 336 tons.
Russian jade culture is closely connected with such jewellery production as Fabergé, whose workshops combined the green stone with gold, diamonds, emeralds, and rubies.

==== Siberia ====
In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a strong belief among many Siberians, which stemmed from tradition, that jade was part of a class of sacred objects that had life.

==== Mongolia ====
In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a strong belief among many Mongolians, which came from ancient tradition, that jade was part of a class of sacred objects that had life.

===Nephrite and jadeite===
It was not until 1863 that French mineralogist Alexis Damour determined that what was referred to as &quot;jade&quot; could in fact be one of two different minerals, either nephrite or jadeite.

Nephrite consists of a microcrystalline interlocking fibrous matrix of the calcium, magnesium-iron rich amphibole mineral series tremolite (calcium-magnesium)-ferroactinolite (calcium-magnesium-iron). The middle member of this series with an intermediate composition is called actinolite (the silky fibrous mineral form is one form of asbestos). The higher the iron content, the greener the colour. Tremolite occurs in metamorphosed dolomitic limestones, and actinolite in metamorphic greenschists/glaucophane schists.

Jadeite is a sodium- and aluminium-rich pyroxene. The more precious kind of jade, this is a microcrystalline interlocking growth of crystals (not a fibrous matrix as nephrite is.) It only occurs in metamorphic rocks.

Both nephrite and jadeite were used from prehistoric periods for hardstone carving. Jadeite has about the same hardness (between 6.0 and 7.0 Mohs hardness) as quartz, while nephrite is slightly softer (6.0 to 6.5) and so can be worked with quartz or garnet sand, and polished with bamboo or even ground jade. However nephrite is tougher and more resistant to breakage. Among the earliest known jade artifacts excavated from prehistoric sites are simple ornaments with bead, button, and tubular shapes. Additionally, jade was used for adze heads, knives, and other weapons, which can be delicately shaped.

As metal-working technologies became available, the beauty of jade made it valuable for ornaments and decorative objects.

===Unusual varieties===

The name Nephrite derives from the Greek word meaning &quot;kidney&quot;. This is because in ancient times it was believed that wearing this kind of jade around the waist could cure kidney disease.

Nephrite can be found in a creamy white form (known in China as &quot;mutton fat&quot; jade) as well as in a variety of light green colours, whereas jadeite shows more colour variations, including blue, brown, red, black, dark green, lavender and white. Of the two, jadeite is rarer, documented in fewer than 12 places worldwide. Translucent emerald-green jadeite is the most prized variety, both historically and today. As &quot;quetzal&quot; jade, bright green jadeite from Guatemala was treasured by Mesoamerican cultures, and as &quot;kingfisher&quot; jade, vivid green rocks from Burma became the preferred stone of post-1800 Chinese imperial scholars and rulers. Burma (Myanmar) and Guatemala are the principal sources of modern gem jadeite. In the area of Mogaung in the Myitkyina District of Upper Burma, jadeite formed a layer in the dark-green serpentine, and has been quarried and exported for well over a hundred years. Canada provides the major share of modern lapidary nephrite.

===Enhancement===
Jade may be enhanced (sometimes called &quot;stabilized&quot;). Some merchants will refer to these as grades, but degree of enhancement is different from colour and texture quality. In other words, Type A jadeite is not enhanced but can have poor colour and texture. There are three main methods of enhancement, sometimes referred to as the ABC Treatment System:
*Type A jadeite has not been treated in any way except surface waxing.
*Type B treatment involves exposing a promising but stained piece of jadeite to chemical bleaches and/or acids and impregnating it with a clear polymer resin. This results in a significant improvement of transparency and colour of the material. Currently, infrared spectroscopy is the most accurate test for the detection of polymer in jadeite.
*Type C jade has been artificially stained or dyed. The effects are somewhat uncontrollable and may result in a dull brown. In any case, translucency is usually lost.
*B+C jade is a combination of B and C: it has been both impregnated and artificially stained.
*Type D jade refers to a composite stone such as a doublet comprising a jade top with a plastic backing.

<text>Johann Friedrich Herbart (; 4 May 1776 – 14 August 1841) was a German philosopher, psychologist and founder of pedagogy as an academic discipline.

Herbart is now remembered amongst the post-Kantian philosophers mostly as making the greatest contrast to Hegel—in particular in relation to aesthetics. His educational philosophy is known as Herbartianism.

==Life==
Herbart was born on 4 May 1776 in Oldenburg. Growing up as a fragile child because of an unfortunate accident, Herbart was taught by his mother at home until the age of 12. He continued his schooling at the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; for six years, and showed interest in philosophy, logic and Kant&#x27;s work involving the nature of knowledge obtained from experience with reality. His education then continued at Jena, whereupon he studied philosophy and came to disagree with his teacher Fichte precisely because Fichte had taught him to think in a logical manner. He composed a few essays, which he had given to Fichte during his years at Jena, criticising the works of Schelling and advocating his contention for the German idealism promoted by others like Kant at the time.

Leaving Jena after three years, he tutored the children of Herr von Steiger, who was the Governor of Interlaken. During these three years, his tutoring job sparked his interest in educational reform. While tutoring in Switzerland, Herbart met and came to know Pestalozzi, the Swiss educator involved with issues of reform in the schools. Resigning from his tutoring position, Herbart went on to study Greek and mathematics at Bremen for three years, and then eventually moved on to attend Göttingen from 1801 to 1809. While there, he received a privat-docent for his endeavours in educational studies after receiving his doctoral degree. He gave his first philosophical lectures at Göttingen around 1805, whence he removed in 1809 to occupy the chair formerly held by Kant at Königsberg. Here he also established and conducted a seminary of pedagogy till 1833, when he returned once more to Göttingen, and remained there as professor of philosophy till his death. Herbart gave his last lecture in perfectly good health and then unexpectedly died two days later from apoplexy. He is buried in Albanifriedhof Cemetery in Göttingen.

Herbart was very much focused on his studies, and &quot;he barely saw the world outside his study and the classrooms&quot; making &quot;his world the world of books and only books&quot;. Regardless of his relentless studying, he met an eighteen-year-old English girl named Mary Drake one night when playing a game of charades. He became acquainted with her and asked her for her hand in marriage. They lived a happy life with Mary supporting all of her husband&#x27;s pursuits and contributions to the fields of pedagogy and psychology.

==Philosophy==

Philosophy, according to Herbart, begins with reflection upon our empirical conceptions, and consists in the reformation and elaboration of these, its three primary divisions being determined by as many distinct forms of elaboration. Logic, which stands first, has to render our conceptions and the judgments and reasonings arising from them clear and distinct. But some conceptions are such that the more distinct they are made the more contradictory their elements become; so to change and supplement these as to make them at length thinkable is the problem of the second part of philosophy, or metaphysics. There is still a class of conceptions requiring more than a logical treatment, but differing from the last in not involving latent contradictions, and in being independent of the reality of their objects, the conceptions that embody our judgments of approval and disapproval; the philosophic treatment of these conceptions falls under aesthetics.

===Logic===

In Herbart&#x27;s writings logic receives comparatively meagre notice; he insisted strongly on its purely formal character and expressed himself in the main at one with Kantians such as Fries and Krug.

===Metaphysics===

As a metaphysician he starts from what he terms the higher scepticism of the Humean–Kantian sphere of thought, the beginnings of which he discerns in Locke&#x27;s perplexity about the idea of substance. The validity of even the forms of experience is called in question on account of the contradictions they are found to involve. And yet that these forms are given to us, as truly as sensations are, follows beyond doubt when we consider that we are as little able to control the one as the other. To attempt at this stage a psychological inquiry into the origin of these conceptions would be doubly a mistake; for we should have to use these illegitimate conceptions in the course of it, and the task of clearing up their contradictions would still remain, whether we succeeded in our enquiry or not.

But how are we to set about this task? We have given to us a conception A uniting among its constituent marks two that prove to be contradictory, say M and N; and we can neither deny the unity nor reject one of the contradictory members. For to do either is forbidden by experience; and yet to do nothing is forbidden by logic. We are thus driven to the assumption that the conception is contradictory because incomplete; but how are we to supplement it? What we have must point the way to what we want, or our procedure will be arbitrary. Experience asserts that M is the same (i.e. a mark of the same concept) as N, while logic denies it; and so it being impossible for one and the same M to sustain these contradictory positions there is but one way open to us; we must posit several Ms. But even now we cannot say one of these Ms is the same as N, another is not; for every M must be both thinkable and valid. We may, however, take the Ms not singly but together; and again, no other course being open to us, this is what we must do; we must assume that N results from a combination of Ms. This is Herbart&#x27;s method of relations, the counterpart in his system of the Hegelian dialectic.

In ontology, this method is employed to determine what in reality corresponds to the empirical conceptions of substance and cause, or rather of inherence and change. But first we must analyse this notion of reality itself, to which our scepticism had already led us, for, though we could doubt whether the given is what it appears, we cannot doubt that it is something; the conception of the real thus consists of the two conceptions of being and quality. That which we are compelled to posit, which cannot be sublated, is that which is, and in the recognition of this lies the simple conception of being. But when is a thing thus posited? When it is posited as we usually posit the things we see and taste and handle. If we were without sensations, i.e. were never bound against our will to endure the persistence of a presentation, we should never know what being is.

Keeping fast hold of this idea of absolute position, Herbart leads us next to the quality of the real:
#This must exclude everything negative; for non-A sublates instead of positing, and is not absolute, but relative to A.
#The real must be absolutely simple; for if it contain two determinations, A and B, then either these are reducible to one, which is the true quality, or they are not, when each is conditioned by the other and their position is no longer absolute.
#All quantitative conceptions are excluded, for quantity implies parts, and these are incompatible with simplicity.
#But there may be a plurality of reals, albeit the mere conception of being can tell us nothing as to this.

The doctrine here developed is the first cardinal point of Herbart&#x27;s system, and the name pluralistic realism has been proposed for it by Otto Pfleiderer.

The contradictions he finds in the common-sense conception of inherence, or of a thing with several attributes, will now become obvious. Take some thing, say A, having &quot;n&quot; attributes, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; ...: we are forced to posit each of these because each is presented in intuition. But in conceiving A we make, not &quot;n&quot; positions, still less &quot;n&quot;+1 positions, but one position simply; for common sense removes the absolute position from its original source, sensation. So when we ask, What is the one posited? we are told the possessor of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; or in other words, their seat or substance. But if so, then A, as a real, being simple, must be equal to &quot;a&quot;; similarly it must be &quot;b&quot;; and so on.

Now this would be possible if &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; ... were only contingent aspects of A, as for example 23, , 4+3+1 are contingent aspects of 8. Such, of course, is not the case, and so we have as many contradictions as there are attributes; for we must say A is &quot;a&quot;, is not &quot;a&quot;, is &quot;b&quot;, is not &quot;b&quot;, etc. There must then, according to the method of relations, be several As. For &quot;a&quot; let us assume A1+A1+A1 ... ; for &quot;b&quot;, A2+A2+A2 ...; and so on for the rest. But now what relation can there be among these several As, which will restore to us the unity of our original A or substance? There is just one; we must assume that the first A of every series is identical, just as the centre is the same point in every radius.

By way of concrete illustration Herbart instances &quot;the common observation that the properties of things exist only under external conditions. Bodies, we say, are coloured, but color is nothing without light, and nothing without eyes. They sound, but only in a vibrating medium, and for healthy ears. Colour and tone present the appearance of inherence, but on looking closer we find they are not really immanent in things but rather presuppose a communion among several.&quot; The result then is briefly thus: In place of the one absolute position, which in some unthinkable way the common understanding substitutes for the absolute positions of the &quot;n&quot; attributes, we have really a series of two or more positions for each attribute, every series, however, beginning with the same (as it were, central) real (hence the unity of substance in a group of attributes), but each being continued by different reals (hence the plurality and difference of attributes in unity of substance). Where there is the appearance of inherence, therefore, there is always a plurality of reals; no such correlative to substance as attribute or accident can be admitted at all. Substantiality is impossible without causality, and to this as its true correlative we now turn.

The common-sense conception of change involves at bottom the same contradiction of opposing qualities in one real. The same A that was &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; ... becomes &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; ...; and this, which experience thrusts upon us, proves on reflection unthinkable. The metaphysical supplementing is also fundamentally as before. Since &quot;c&quot; depended on a series of reals A3+A3+A3 ... in connection with A, and &quot;d&quot; may be said similarly to depend on a series A4+A4+A4 ..., then the change from &quot;c&quot; to &quot;d&quot; means, not that the central real A or any real has changed, but that A is now in connection with A4, etc., and no longer in connection with A3, etc.

But to think a number of reals in connection (&quot;Zusammensein&quot;) will not suffice as an explanation of phenomena; something or other must happen when they are in connection; what is it? The answer to this question is the second hinge-point of Herbart&#x27;s theoretical philosophy.

What actually happens as distinct from all that seems to happen, when two reals A and B are together is that, assuming them to differ in quality, they tend to disturb each other to the extent of that difference, at the same time that each preserves itself intact by resisting, as it were, the others disturbance. And so by coining into connection with different reals the self-preservations of A will vary accordingly, A remaining the same through all; just as, by way of illustration, hydrogen remains the same in water and in ammonia, or as the same line may be now a normal and now a tangent. But to indicate this opposition in the qualities of the reals A+B, we must substitute for these symbols others, which, though only contingent aspects of A and B, i.e. representing their relations, not themselves, yet like similar devices in mathematics enable thought to advance. Thus we may put A = &quot;α&quot;+&quot;β&quot;-&quot;γ&quot;, B = &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;+&quot;γ&quot;; &quot;γ&quot; then represents the character of the
self-preservations in this case, and &quot;α&quot;+&quot;β&quot;+&quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot; represents all that could be observed by a spectator who did not know the simple qualities, but was himself involved in the relations of A to B; and such is exactly our position.

Having thus determined what really is and what actually happens, our philosopher proceeds next to explain synthetically the objective semblance (&quot;der objective Schein&quot;) that results from these. But if this construction is to be truly objective, i.e. valid for all intelligences, ontology must furnish us with a clue. This we have in the forms of Space, Time and Motion which are involved whenever we think the reals as being in, or coming into, connection and the opposite. These forms then cannot be merely the products of our psychological mechanism, though they may turn out to coincide with these. Meanwhile, let us call them intelligible, as being valid for all who comprehend the real and actual by thought, although no such forms are predicable of the real and actual themselves.

The elementary spatial relation Herbart conceives to be &quot;the contiguity (&quot;Aneinander&quot;) of two points,&quot; so that every &quot;pure and independent line&quot; is discrete. But an investigation of dependent lines which are often incommensurable forces us to adopt the contradictory fiction of partially overlapping, i.e. divisible points, or in other words, the conception of Continuity. But the contradiction here is one we cannot eliminate by the method of relations, because it does not involve anything real; and in fact as a necessary outcome of an intelligible form, the fiction of continuity is valid for the objective semblance. By its help we are enabled to comprehend what actually happens among reals to produce the appearance of water. When three or more reals are together, each disturbance and self-preservation will (in general) be imperfect, i.e. of less intensity than when only two reals are together. But objective semblance corresponds with reality; the spatial or external relations of the reals in this case must, therefore, tally with their inner or actual states. Had the self-preservations been perfect, the coincidence in space would have been complete, and the group of reals would have been inextended; or had the several reals been simply contiguous, i.e. without connection, then, as nothing would actually have happened, nothing would appear. As it is we shall find a continuous molecule manifesting attractive and repulsive forces; attraction corresponding to the tendency of the self-preservations to become perfect, repulsion to the frustration of this. Motion, even more evidently than space, implicates the contradictory conception of continuity and cannot, therefore, be a real predicate, though valid as an intelligible form and necessary to the comprehension of the objective semblance. For we have to think of the reals as absolutely independent and yet as entering into connections. This we can only do by conceiving them as originally moving through intelligible space in rectilinear paths and with uniform velocities. For such motion no cause need be supposed; motion, in fact, is no more a state of the moving real than rest is, both alike being but relations, with which, therefore, the real has no concern. The changes in this motion, however, for which we should require a cause, would be the objective semblance of the self-preservations that actually occur when reals meet. Further, by means of such motion these actual occurrences, which are in themselves timeless, fall for an observer in a definite time — a time which becomes continuous through the partial coincidence of events.

But in all this it has been assumed that we are spectators of the objective semblance; it remains to make good this assumption, or, in other words, to show the possibility of knowledge; this is the problem of what Herbart terms Eidolology, and forms the transition from metaphysic to psychology. Here, again, a contradictory conception blocks the way, that, viz. of the Ego as the identity of knowing and being, and as such the stronghold of idealism. The contradiction becomes more evident when the ego is defined to be a subject (and so a real) that is its own object. As real and not merely formal, this conception of the ego is amenable to the method of relations. The solution this method furnishes is summarily that there are several objects which mutually modify each other, and so constitute that ego we take for the presented real. But to explain this modification is the business of psychology; it is enough now to see that the subject like all reals is necessarily unknown and that, therefore, the idealist&#x27;s theory of knowledge is unsound. But though the simple quality of the subject or soul is beyond knowledge, we know what actually happens when it is in connection with other&#x27;s reals, for its self-preservations then are what we call sensations. And these sensations are the sole material of our knowledge; but they are not given to us as a chaos but in definite groups and series, whence we come to know the relations of those reals, which, though themselves unknown, our sensations compel us to posit absolutely.

===Principles of education ===

Herbart&#x27;s pedagogy emphasised the connection between individual development and the resulting societal contribution. In Platonic tradition, Herbart espoused that only by becoming productive citizens could people fulfill their true purpose: &quot;He believed that every child is born with a unique potential, his Individuality, but that this potential remained unfulfilled until it was analysed and transformed by education in accordance with what he regarded as the accumulated values of civilisation&quot;. Only formalised, rigorous education could, he believed, provide the framework for moral and intellectual development. The five key ideas which composed his concept of individual maturation were Inner Freedom, Perfection, Benevolence, Justice and Equity or Recompense.

According to Herbart, abilities were not innate but could be instilled, so a thorough education could provide the framework for moral and intellectual development. In order to develop an educational paradigm that would provide an intellectual base that would lead to a consciousness of social responsibility, Herbart advocated that teachers utilise a methodology with five formal steps: &quot;Using this structure a teacher prepared a topic of 
interest to the children, presented that topic, and questioned them inductively, so that they reached new knowledge based on what they had already known, looked back and deductively summed up the lesson&#x27;s achievements, then related them to moral precepts for daily living&quot;.

In order to appeal to learners&#x27; interests, Herbart advocated using literature and historical stories instead of the drier basal readers that were popular at the time. Whereas the moralistic tales in many of the primers and readers of the period were predictable and allegorical, Herbart felt that children would appreciate the psychological and literary nuances of the masterpieces of the canon.

Though he died in 1841, his pedagogy enjoyed a renaissance of sorts in the mid-19th century; while Germany was its intellectual centre, it &quot;found a ready echo in those countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in which the development of Individuality into Character appeared particularly well attuned to the prevailing economic, political and social circumstances.&quot; Among those who espoused and advocated his ideas in the United Kingdom was Catherine Isabella Dodd. The combination of individual potentiality and civic responsibility seemed to reflect democratic ideals.

Though the emphasis on character building through literary appreciation diminished somewhat after the movement toward utilitarianism following the First World War, Herbart&#x27;s pedagogy continues to influence the field by raising important questions about the role of critical thinking, and literary appreciation in education.

===Aesthetics and ethics===

Aesthetics elaborates the ideas involved in the expression called forth by those relations of object which acquire for them attribution of beauty or the reverse. The beautiful is to be carefully distinguished from the allied conceptions of the useful or the pleasant, which vary with time, place and person; whereas beauty is predicated absolutely and involuntarily by all who have attained the right standpoint. Ethics, which is but one branch of aesthetics, although the chief, deals with such relations among volitions (&quot;Willensverhältnisse&quot;) as thus unconditionally please or displease. These relations Herbart finds to be reducible to five, which do admit of further simplification; and corresponding to them are as many moral ideas (&quot;Musterbegriffe&quot;), as follows:
#Internal Freedom, the underlying relation being that of the individual&#x27;s will to his judgment of it
#Perfection, the relation being that of his several volitions each other in respect of intensity, variety and concentration
#Benevolence, the relation being that between his own will and the thought of another&#x27;s
#Right, in case of actual conflict with other
#Retribution or Equity, for intended good or evil
The ideas of a final society, a system of rewards and punishments, a system of administration, a system of culture and an animated society, corresponding to the ideas of law, equity, benevolence, perfection and internal freedom respectively, result when we take account of a number of individuals. Virtue is the perfect conformity of the will with the moral ideas; of this the single virtues are but special expressions. The conception of duty arises from the existence of hindrances to the attainment of virtue. A general scheme of principles of conduct is possible, but the sublimation of special cases under these must remain matter of fact. The application of ethics to things as they are with a view to the realisation of the moral ideas is moral technology (&quot;Tugendlehre&quot;), which the chief divisions are Paedagogy and Politics.

===Theology===

In theology, Herbart held the argument from design to be as valid of divine activity as for human, and to justify the belief in a supersensible real, concerning which, however, exact knowledge is neither tenable nor on practical grounds desirable.

==Psychology==

===Herbart&#x27;s concept of the &quot;Real&quot;===

Building upon the teaching methods of Pestalozzi, Herbart contributed to pedagogy a psychological basis to help facilitate better learning as well as to ensure children&#x27;s character development. He was the first individual to point out how important a role psychology plays on education. In developing his ideas about psychology, Herbart came to disagree with Kant about how true knowledge is obtained. Kant believed that we become knowledgeable through studying the innate categories of thought, while Herbart believed that one learns only from studying external and real objects in the world as well as the ideas that come about from observing them. Examining the difference between the actual existence of an object and its appearance, Herbart concluded that &quot;the world is a world of things-in-themselves [and] the things-in-themselves are perceivable&quot;. Everything&#x27;s appearance indicates that it exists. He considered all external objects existing in the world as &quot;reals&quot;, which can be compared to Leibniz&#x27;s concept of monads.
Subscribing to Locke&#x27;s empiricist viewpoint involving the &quot;tabula rasa&quot;, Herbart believed that the soul had no innate ideas or no already pre-established Kantian categories of thought. The soul, considered to be a &quot;real&quot;, was thought to be completely passive initially as well as very resistant to changes outside factors exert and force upon it. Even though &quot;reals&quot; are disrupted by other forces appearing to cause a change in the &quot;reals&quot; themselves, they are thought to be unchangeable. &quot;Reals&quot; tend to collide and struggle with one another so much so that each &quot;real&quot; fights for its own self-preservation (&quot;Selbsterhaltung&quot;). The way in which the soul helps to preserve itself from its outwardly perceived destruction is through Herbart&#x27;s concept of &quot;Vorstellungen&quot;, or ideas or mental representations. These ideas were regarded as dynamic forces that Herbart attempted to explain by means of mathematical formulas. Newton&#x27;s influence can be seen in Herbart&#x27;s beliefs about how forces mechanically interact with one another in the world to affect perceptions of reality. The mechanics of ideas involved their ability to move in different ways, whether they be moving up into the conscious or delving down into the unconscious. Different ideas come into contact with each other and result in more complex ideas through the processes of blending, fusing, fading and combining in a multitude of approaches. It is evident Herbart thought that ideas were not precise imitations of the existing items in the world but that they were the direct consequence of the interactions of individuals&#x27; experiences with the external environment. An individual can gain all the facts and their associated truth only by understanding how their mental representations combine and potentially inhibit or contribute to one another.

===Apperception===

Herbart believed ideas crossed a limen of consciousness, or a boundary between the conscious and the unconscious, as they became clearer and strong enough to preserve themselves against their struggle with other forces. The ideas powerful enough to break through to the conscious formed the apperceiving mass, or a congregation of similar and related ideas dominating the conscious at any given moment. Expounding upon Leibniz&#x27;s concept of &quot;petites perceptions&quot; and the idea of apperception, Herbart believed the apperceiving mass to be crucial in selecting similar ideas from down in the unconscious to join its forces in the conscious. Although the individual is focusing all of his/her attention on those complex ideas a part of the apperceiving mass in the conscious, it is possible for ideas in the unconscious to combine with other ideas related to them and struggle to break through the limen into the conscious, disrupting the present ideas a part of the apperceiving mass. Apperception played a key role in Herbart&#x27;s educational theory. He saw apperception as more pivotal in the classroom than sense-perception, because focusing on a child&#x27;s apperceiving mass in relation to the material being taught can inform teachers of how to implement the material in such a way as to direct the child&#x27;s ideas and thoughts to attend to certain information.

<text>HMS &quot;Kent&quot; was one of 10 armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. She was placed in reserve when completed in 1903, but was recommissioned for the China Station in 1906. She remained there until she returned home in 1913 for a lengthy refit.

At the beginning of World War I in August 1914, she was still refitting. In October &quot;Kent&quot; was ordered to the South Atlantic to join Rear-Admiral Christopher Cradock&#x27;s squadron in their search for the German East Asia Squadron, but arrived at the Falkland Islands after the British squadron had been destroyed in the Battle of Coronel. During the subsequent Battle of the Falkland Islands at the end of 1914, the ship sank the German light cruiser . Several months later she discovered the sole surviving German ship from that battle and forced the light cruiser to scuttle herself in the Battle of Más a Tierra. She was assigned to patrol the South American coast for the rest of 1915, but was transferred to the Cape Station in early 1916 to begin convoy escort duties along the West African coast until mid-1918 when she returned to the China Station. In early 1919 the ship was deployed to Vladivostok to support the Siberian Intervention against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. She did little militarily there, although she contributed some crewmen to man gunboats supporting the Whites opposing the Bolsheviks. &quot;Kent&quot; was sold for scrap in China in 1920.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Monmouth&quot;s were intended to protect British merchant shipping from fast cruisers like the French , or the . The ships were designed to displace . They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft using steam provided by 31 Belleville boilers. The engines produced a total of which was designed to give the ships a maximum speed of . &quot;Kent&quot;, however, was one of three of the &quot;Monmouth&quot;s that failed to meet her designed speed. She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 678 officers and ratings.

The &quot;Monmouth&quot;-class ships&#x27; main armament consisted of fourteen breech-loading (BL) Mk VII guns. Four of these guns were mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure, and the others were positioned in casemates amidships. Six of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather. Ten quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder () 12-cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. &quot;Kent&quot; also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes.

Beginning in 1915, the main deck six-inch guns of the &quot;Monmouth&quot;-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve seakeeping. The twelve-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At some point in the war, a pair of three-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the upper deck.

The ship&#x27;s waterline armour belt was thick amidships and forward. The armour of the gun turrets, their barbettes and the casemates was four inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour.

==Construction and service==

&quot;Kent&quot;, named to commemorate the English county, was laid down at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard on 12 February 1900 and launched on 6 March 1901 (one day late due to weather), when she was christened by Lady Hotham, wife of Admiral Sir Charles Frederick Hotham, GCB, Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. She was completed on 1 October 1903 and was initially placed in reserve. On 15 March 1905 she ran aground in the Firth of Forth. The ship was assigned to the China Station between 1906 and 1913 and returned to Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit in September 1913.

She was still refitting in August 1914 when the war began and was ordered south to join Cradock&#x27;s squadron searching for the East Asia Squadron after completing her sea trials in October. &quot;Kent&quot;, however, was diverted en route to hunt for the German light cruiser in the Cape Verde – Canary Islands area. When the news of the disastrous Battle of Coronel reached the Admiralty in early November, she was at Freetown, Sierra Leone, and was ordered to resume her original mission. She reached the Abrolhos Archipelago where she was to rendezvous with Rear-Admiral Archibald Stoddart&#x27;s force. While awaiting them, she patrolled the coast down to Montevideo, Uruguay, and fired her six-inch guns at targets for the first time after her refit. During this time the ship evidenced the results of a too-hastily completed refit with condenser problems and engine defects that sometimes left her unable to steam faster than 10 knots. Vice-Admiral Doveton Sturdee&#x27;s battlecruisers arrived on the 26th and he took Stoddart&#x27;s ships under his command and then proceeded to the Falkland Islands two days later.

===Battle of the Falklands===

Upon arrival at Port Stanley on 7 December, Sturdee ordered &quot;Kent&quot; to anchor in the outer harbour and be prepared to relieve the armed merchant cruiser as the harbour guardship the following morning. He planned to recoal the entire squadron the following day from the two available colliers and to begin the search for the East Asia Squadron the day after. Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, had other plans and intended to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley on the morning of 8 December. The appearance of two German ships at 07:30 caught Sturdee&#x27;s ships by surprise although they were driven off by shells fired by the predreadnought battleship when they came within range around 09:20. &quot;Kent&quot;, though, had been ordered out of the harbour at 08:10 to protect &quot;Macedonia&quot; and keep the Germans under observation. This gave time for the squadron to raise steam, although the cruisers had not yet begun to recoal. The squadron cleared the harbour by 10:30 and Sturdee ordered, &quot;general chase&quot;. His two battlecruisers were the fastest ships present and inexorably began to close on the German cruisers. They opened fire at 12:55 and began to straddle the light cruiser , the rear ship in the German formation. It was clear to Spee that his ships could not outrun the battlecruisers and that the only hope for any of his ships to survive was to scatter. So he turned his two armoured cruisers around to buy time by engaging the battlecruisers and ordered his three light cruisers to disperse at 13:20.
In accordance with Sturdee&#x27;s plans, &quot;Kent&quot;, her sister ship, , and the light cruiser immediately set off in pursuit while the battlecruisers and the slow armoured cruiser dealt with the German armoured cruisers. At 14:45 &quot;Glasgow&quot;, the fastest of the British cruisers, was close enough to &quot;Leipzig&quot; to open fire and the two ships exchanged salvos, scoring the occasional hit. An hour later, the Germans scattered in different directions; &quot;Cornwall&quot; and &quot;Glasgow&quot; pursued &quot;Leipzig&quot; while &quot;Kent&quot; went after . Short on coal, her crew threw in everything burnable, and she reached in her pursuit; she closed to within when the German cruiser opened fire at 17:00. &quot;Kent&quot; replied nine minutes later with her forward guns; neither ship hit anything at that time. At 17:35 two of &quot;Nürnberg&quot;″s worn-out boilers burst, which reduced her speed to . As &quot;Kent&quot; continued to close, the German ship turned about for a fight when the range was down to .

Most of the German shells failed to damage the British ship, but one did burst inside a gun position, killing or wounding most of its crew, and another burst inside the wireless compartment and knocked out her radio transmitter. The British shells battered &quot;Nürnberg&quot; severely; she was dead in the water by 18:25 with only two guns able to fire. Ten minutes later not a gun could shoot and the cruiser was aflame. She did not strike her colours until 18:57 and then lowered a boat filled with some of her wounded men. It promptly sank and &quot;Kent&quot; had to repair the splinter holes in her own boats before they could be launched. &quot;Nürnberg&quot; capsized half an hour later and &quot;Kent&quot; continued to search until 21:00, but only rescued a dozen men, five of whom later died. She had been hit 38 times, but none of them penetrated her armour. One shell passed through the radio office without detonating and disabled &quot;Kent&quot;″s transmitter. Another shell burst outside a midships casemate and ignited several bags of cordite. The flash fire travelled down the ammunition hoist, but quick action by a Royal Marine in the ammunition party in removing the cordite charge ready to be hoisted, closing the door to the magazine and promptly using a fire hose prevented a catastrophe. The ship suffered six crewmen were killed and eight seriously wounded during the battle; ten of these were in the casemate where the cordite ignited. &quot;Kent&quot; was critically short of coal and had to steam slowly enough that she did not arrive at Port Stanley until the following afternoon.

===Battle of Más a Tierra===

Sturdee&#x27;s ships continued to search for even after he returned to England. The German cruiser successfully evaded the searching British for months by hiding in the maze of bays and channels surrounding Tierra del Fuego. She began moving up the Chilean coast in February 1915 until she was unexpectedly spotted by &quot;Kent&quot; at a range of 11,000 yards on 8 March when a fog burned off. The British cruiser tried to close the distance, but &quot;Dresden&quot; managed to break contact after a five-hour chase. &quot;Kent&quot;, however, intercepted a message during the pursuit from &quot;Dresden&quot; to one of her colliers to meet her at Robinson Crusoe Island in the Juan Fernández Islands. &quot;Dresden&quot; arrived there the next day, virtually out of coal.
International law allowed the German ship a stay of 24 hours before she would have to leave or be interned and her captain claimed that his engines were disabled which extended the deadline to eight days. In the meantime, &quot;Kent&quot; had summoned &quot;Glasgow&quot; and the two ships entered Cumberland Bay in the island on the morning of 14 March and found &quot;Dresden&quot; at anchor. The German ship trained her guns on the British ships and &quot;Glasgow&quot; opened fire, Captain John Luce justifying his action by deeming it an unfriendly act by an interned ship that had frequently violated Chilean neutrality. &quot;Dresden&quot; hoisted a white flag four minutes later as she was already on fire and holed at her waterline. A boat brought Lieutenant Wilhelm Canaris to &quot;Glasgow&quot; to complain that his ship was under Chilean protection. Luce told him that the question of neutrality could be settled by diplomats and that he would destroy the German ship unless she surrendered. By the time that Canaris returned to &quot;Dresden&quot;, her crew had finished preparations for scuttling and abandoned ship after opening her Kingston valves. It took 20 minutes before the cruiser capsized to port and sank. The British shells had killed one midshipman and eight sailors and wounded three officers and twelve ratings.

===Subsequent activities===

&quot;Kent&quot; patrolled the Chilean coast for the next several months, searching for German colliers. The ship was refitted at Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard in British Columbia from 25 May to 9 July. She resumed patrolling the Pacific coast of South America until she arrived at the Falklands on 7 March 1916 and departed on 6 April to unsuccessfully search for Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s Antarctic expedition on South Georgia Island and then Simon&#x27;s Town, South Africa, where they arrived on the 23rd. Refitting until 29 May, &quot;Kent&quot; was running trials and working up until 15 June. She then began escorting convoys between South Africa and West African ports, or the Cape Verde Islands. She escorted a convoy to England where she arrived at Devonport on 7 January 1917 and then resumed her convoy escort duties along the African coast. The ship arrived in England on 4 June 1918 to begin a refit at HM Dockyard, Devonport, but as &quot;Kent&quot; was preparing to leave the convoy a little after midnight, she apparently steered for , causing that ship to turn to avoid being rammed and cutting off the stern of the destroyer . That caused a depth charge to detonate underneath &quot;Kenilworth Castle&quot;, blowing a hole in that ship&#x27;s hull although she successfully made it to port.

&quot;Kent&quot; was refitting until 14 July when she departed for Siberia to relieve her sister . After arriving at Simon&#x27;s Town, the ship sailed for Singapore on 24 August. She arrived there on 20 September and then continued onwards to Hong Kong which she reached on 10 October. &quot;Kent&quot; remained there with engine problems until 21 December when she departed for Vladivostok via Shanghai, China, and Nagasaki, Japan. The ship arrived there on 4 January 1919 to support American and Japanese forces in action against the Bolsheviks. About half of her Royal Marines and a few crewmen volunteered to man a six-inch gun and some 12-pounder guns left behind by &quot;Suffolk&quot; in Omsk on 6 April. They converted a tugboat in Perm to mount the 12-pounders and modified a large barge for the six-inch gun. On 23 May they engaged a Bolshevik river flotilla near Elabuga and drove three of the Communists&#x27; ships ashore and set one afire. Their victory did little to effect the strategic situation as the Bolsheviks drove the Whites back to Perm. &quot;Kent&quot;″s troops were able to transfer the guns to railroad cars before the city was captured on 30 June and they were sold to the Whites once the men reached Omsk. They arrived back at Vladivostok on 18 August to find out that &quot;Kent&quot; had ordered to Hong Kong in their absence.

On 13 May, &quot;Kent&quot; accompanied the Russian steamship carrying troops to seize Tetyukhe; the ships later loaded refugees and arrived back at Vladivostok three days later. &quot;Kent&quot; departed Vladivostok on 23 June bound for Hong Kong via Weihaiwei, China. She arrived at her destination on 2 July and was paid off on 7 August. The ship was listed for sale there in March 1920 and sold for scrap on 20 June.

In 1964 a Falklands Islands commemorative stamp incorrectly pictured HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; instead of &quot;Kent&quot;.

<text>Michael Servetus (; ; ; also known as &quot;Michel Servetus&quot;, &quot;Miguel de Villanueva&quot;, &quot;Revés&quot;, or &quot;Michel de Villeneuve&quot;; 29 September 1509 or 1511 – 27 October 1553) was a Spanish theologian, physician, cartographer, and Renaissance humanist. He was the first European to correctly describe the function of pulmonary circulation, as discussed in &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot; (1553). He was a polymath versed in many sciences: mathematics, astronomy and meteorology, geography, human anatomy, medicine and pharmacology, as well as jurisprudence, translation, poetry, and the scholarly study of the Bible in its original languages.

He is renowned in the history of several of these fields, particularly medicine. His work on the circulation of blood and his observations on pulmonary circulation were particularly important. He participated in the Protestant Reformation, and later rejected the Trinity doctrine and mainstream Catholic Christology.

After being condemned by Catholic authorities in France, he fled to Calvinist Geneva where he was denounced by John Calvin himself and burned at the stake for heresy by order of the city&#x27;s governing council.

== Life ==
=== Early life and education ===
For a long time, it was held that Servetus was probably born in 1511 in Villanueva de Sigena in the Kingdom of Aragon, present-day Spain. The day of 29 September has been conventionally proposed for his birth, due to the fact that 29 September is Saint Michael&#x27;s day according to the Catholic calendar of saints, but there is no evidence supporting this date. Some sources give an earlier date based on Servetus&#x27; own occasional claim of having been born in 1509. However, in 2002 a paper published by Francisco Javier González Echeverría and María Teresa Ancín suggested that he was born in Tudela, Kingdom of Navarre. It has also been held that his true name was &quot;De Villanueva&quot; according to the letters of his French naturalization (Chamber des Comptes, Royal Chancellorship and Parlement of Grenoble) and the registry at the University of Paris.

The ancestors of his father came from the hamlet of Serveto, in the Aragonese Pyrenees. His father was a notary of Christian ancestors from the lower nobility (&quot;infanzón&quot;), who worked at the nearby Monastery of Santa Maria de Sigena. It was long believed that Servetus had just two brothers: Juan, who was a Catholic parish priest, and Pedro, who was a notary. But it has been recently documented that Servetus actually had two more brothers (Antón and Francisco) and at least three sisters (Catalina, Jeronima, and Juana). Although Servetus declared during his trial in Geneva that his parents were &quot;Christians of ancient race&quot;, and that he never had any communication with Jews, his maternal line actually descended from the Zaportas (or Çaportas), a wealthy and socially relevant Converso family from the Barbastro and Monzón areas in Aragon. This was demonstrated by a notarial protocol published in 1999.

Servetus&#x27; family used a nickname, &quot;Revés&quot;, according to an old tradition in rural Spain of using alternate names for families across generations. The origin of the Revés nickname may have been that a member of a (probably distinguished) family living in Villanueva with the surname Revés established blood ties with the Servet family, thus uniting both family names for the next generations.

===Education===
Servetus attended the Grammar Studium in Sariñena, Aragón, near Villanueva de Sijena, under master Domingo Manobel until 1520. From course 1520/1521 to 1522/1523, Michael Servetus was a student of the Liberal Arts in the primitive University of Zaragoza, a Studium Generale of Arts. The Studium was ruled by the Archbishop of Saragossa, the Rector, the High Master (&quot;Maestro Mayor&quot;), and four &quot;Masters of Arts&quot;, which resembled Art professors in the Arts Faculties of other primitive universities. Servetus studied under High Master Gaspar Lax, and masters Exerich, Ansias, and Miranda. During those years this education center had been significantly influenced by Erasmus&#x27;s ideas. Ansias and Miranda died soon, and two new professors were appointed: Juan Lorenzo Carnicer and Villalpando. In 1523 he got his BA and next year his MA. From course 1525/1526 ahead, Servetus became one of the four Masters of Arts in the Studium, and for unknown reasons, he traveled to Salamanca in February 1527. But on 28 March 1527, also for unknown reasons, master Michael Servetus had a brawl with High Master (and uncle) Gaspard Lax, and this probably was the cause of his expulsion from the Studium, and his exile from Spain for the Studium of Toulouse, trying to avoid the strong influence of Gaspar Lax in any Spanish Studium Generale.

Near 1527 Servetus attended the University of Toulouse where he studied law. Servetus could have had access to forbidden religious books, some of them maybe Protestant, while he was studying in this city.

=== Career ===
In 1530 Servetus joined the retinue of Emperor Charles V as page or secretary to the emperor&#x27;s confessor, Juan de Quintana. Servetus travelled through Italy and Germany and attended Charles&#x27; coronation as Holy Roman Emperor in Bologna. He was outraged by the pomp and luxury displayed by the Pope and his retinue, and so decided to follow the path of reformation. It is not known when Servetus left the imperial entourage, but in October 1530 he visited Johannes Oecolampadius in Basel, staying there for about ten months, probably supporting himself as a proofreader for a local printer. By this time, he was already spreading his theological beliefs. In May 1531 he met Martin Bucer and Wolfgang Fabricius Capito in Strasbourg.

Two months later, in July 1531, Servetus published &quot;De Trinitatis Erroribus&quot; (&quot;On the Errors of the Trinity&quot;). The next year he published the work &quot;Dialogorum de Trinitate&quot; (&quot;Dialogues on the Trinity&quot;) and the supplementary work &quot;De Iustitia Regni Christi&quot; (&quot;On the Justice of Christ&#x27;s Reign&quot;) in the same volume. After the persecution of the Inquisition, Servetus assumed the name &quot;Michel de Villeneuve&quot; while he was staying in France. He studied at the Collège de Calvi in Paris in 1533.
Servetus also published the first French edition of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. He dedicated his first edition of Ptolemy and his edition of the Bible to his patron Hugues de la Porte. While in Lyon, Symphorien Champier, a medical humanist, had been his patron. Servetus wrote a pharmacological treatise in defence of Champier against Leonhart Fuchs &quot;In Leonardum Fucsium Apologia&quot; (&quot;Apology against Leonard Fuchs&quot;). Working also as a proofreader, he published several more books, which dealt with medicine and pharmacology (such as his &quot;Syruporum universia ratio&quot; (&quot;Complete Explanation of the Syrups&quot;)), for which he gained fame.

After an interval, Servetus returned to Paris to study medicine in 1536. In Paris, his teachers included Jacobus Sylvius, Jean Fernel, and Johann Winter von Andernach, who hailed him with Andrea Vesalius as his most able assistant in dissections. During these years, he wrote his &quot;Manuscript of the Complutense&quot;, an unpublished compendium of his medical ideas. Servetus taught mathematics and astrology while he studied medicine. He predicted an occultation of Mars by the Moon, which along with his teaching, generated much envy among the medicine teachers. His teaching classes were suspended by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Jean Tagault, and Servetus wrote his &quot;Apologetic Discourse of Michel de Villeneuve in Favour of Astrology and against a Certain Physician&quot; against him. Tagault later argued for the death penalty in the judgment of the University of Paris against Servetus, who was accused of teaching &quot;De Divinatione&quot; by Cicero. Finally, the sentence was reduced to the withdrawal of this edition. As a result of the risks and difficulties of studying medicine at Paris, Servetus decided to go to Montpellier to finish his medical studies, maybe thanks to his teacher Sylvius who did exactly the same as a student. There Servetus became a Doctor of Medicine in 1539. After that he lived at Charlieu. A jealous physician ambushed and tried to kill Servetus, but Servetus defended himself and injured one of the attackers in a sword fight. He was in prison for several days because of this incident.

=== Working at Vienne ===

After his studies in medicine, Servetus started a medical practice. He became the personal physician to Pierre Palmier, Archbishop of Vienne and was the physician to Guy de Maugiron, the lieutenant governor of Dauphiné. Thanks to the printer Jean Frellon II, acquaintance of John Calvin and friend of Michel, Servetus and Calvin began to correspond. Calvin used the pseudonym &quot;Charles d&#x27;Espeville&quot;. Servetus also became a French citizen, using his &quot;De Villeneuve&quot; &quot;persona&quot;, by the Royal Process (1548–1549) of French Naturalization, issued by Henri II of France.

In 1553 Michael Servetus published another religious work with further anti-trinitarian views entitled &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot; (&quot;The Restoration of Christianity&quot;), a work that sharply rejected the idea of predestination as the idea that God condemned souls to Hell regardless of worth or merit. God, insisted Servetus, condemns no one who does not condemn himself through thought, word, or deed. This work also includes the first published description of the pulmonary circulation in Europe, though it&#x27;s thought to be based on work by 13th century Syrian polymath ibn al-Nafis.

Servetus had sent an early version of his book to Calvin. To Calvin, who had published his summary of Christian doctrine &quot;Institutio Christianae Religionis&quot; (&quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot;) in 1536, Servetus&#x27; latest book was an attack on historical Nicene Christian doctrine and a misinterpretation of the biblical canon. Calvin sent a copy of his own book as his reply. Servetus promptly returned it, thoroughly annotated with critical observations. Calvin wrote to Servetus, &quot;I neither hate you nor despise you; nor do I wish to persecute you; but I would be as hard as iron when I behold you insulting sound doctrine with so great audacity&quot;. In time, their correspondence grew more heated until Calvin ended it. Servetus sent Calvin several more letters, to which Calvin took offense. Thus, Calvin&#x27;s frustrations with Servetus seem to have been based mainly on Servetus&#x27;s criticisms of Calvinist doctrine, but also on his tone, which Calvin considered inappropriate. Calvin revealed these frustrations with Servetus when writing to his friend William Farel on 13 February 1546:

=== Imprisonment and execution ===
On 16 February 1553, Michael Servetus while in Vienne, France, was denounced as a heretic by Guillaume de Trie (a rich merchant who had taken refuge in Geneva and who was a good friend of Calvin) in a letter sent to a cousin, Antoine Arneys, who was living in Lyon. On behalf of the French inquisitor Matthieu Ory, Michael Servetus and Balthasard Arnollet, the printer of &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot;, were questioned, but they denied all charges and were released for lack of evidence. Ory asked Arneys to write back to De Trie demanding proof. On 26 March 1553, the letters sent by Michael to Calvin and some manuscript pages of &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot; were forwarded to Lyon by De Trie. On 4 April 1553, Servetus was arrested by Roman Catholic authorities and imprisoned in Vienne. He escaped from prison three days later. On 17 June, he was convicted of heresy, &quot;thanks to the 17 letters sent by John Calvin, preacher in Geneva&quot; and sentenced to be burned with his books. In his absence, he and his books were burned in effigy (blank paper for the books).

Meaning to flee to Italy, Servetus inexplicably stopped in Geneva, where Calvin and his Reformers had denounced him. On 13 August, he attended a sermon by Calvin at Geneva. He was arrested after the service and again imprisoned, and all his property was confiscated. Servetus claimed during this proceeding that he had been arrested at an inn at Geneva. French inquisitors asked that he be extradited to them for execution, but Calvin wanted to show that he was as firm in defense of Christian orthodoxy as his opponents, and determined &quot;to push the condemnation of Servetus with all the means at his command&quot;. Calvin&#x27;s health was one possible reason why he did not personally appear against Servetus. The laws regulating criminal actions in Geneva required that in certain grave cases the complainant himself should be incarcerated pending the trial. Calvin&#x27;s health, and his importance in the administration of the state, rendered a prolonged absence from the public life of Geneva impracticable. Therefore Nicholas de la Fontaine had the more active role in Servetus&#x27;s prosecution and the listing of the points that condemned him. (Nicholas de la Fontaine was a refugee in Geneva and entered the service of Calvin, by whom he was employed as secretary.) Nevertheless, Calvin is regarded as the author of the prosecution.

At his trial, Servetus was condemned on two counts for spreading and preaching Nontrinitarianism, specifically, Modalistic Monarchianism (or Sabellianism) and anti-paedobaptism (anti-infant baptism). Of paedobaptism Servetus had said, &quot;It is an invention of the devil, an infernal falsity for the destruction of all Christianity.&quot; In the case, the &quot;procureur général&quot; (chief public prosecutor) added some curious-sounding accusations in the form of inquiries—the most odd-sounding perhaps being, &quot;whether he has married, and if he answers that he has not, he shall be asked why, in consideration of his age, he could refrain so long from marriage.&quot; To this oblique imputation about his sexuality, Servetus replied that rupture (inguinal hernia) had long since made him incapable of that particular sin. Another question was &quot;whether he did not know that his doctrine was pernicious, considering that he favours Jews and Turks, by making excuses for them, and if he has not studied the Koran in order to disprove and controvert the doctrine and religion that the Christian churches hold, together with other profane books, from which people ought to abstain in matters of religion, according to the doctrine of St. Paul.&quot;

Calvin believed that Servetus deserved death because of what Calvin termed &quot;execrable blasphemies&quot;. Calvin expressed these sentiments in a letter to Farel, written about a week after Servetus&#x27; arrest, in which he also mentioned an exchange with Servetus. Calvin wrote:

...after he [Servetus] had been recognized, I thought he should be detained. My friend Nicolas summoned him on a capital charge, offering himself as a security according to the &quot;lex talionis&quot;. On the following day he adduced against him forty written charges. He at first sought to evade them. Accordingly we were summoned. He impudently reviled me, just as if he regarded me as obnoxious to him. I answered him as he deserved... of the man’s effrontery I will say nothing; but such was his madness that he did not hesitate to say that devils possessed divinity; yea, that many gods were in individual devils, inasmuch as a deity had been substantially communicated to those equally with wood and stone. I hope that sentence of death will at least be passed on him; but I desired that the severity of the punishment be mitigated.

As Servetus was not a citizen of Geneva, and legally could at worst be banished, the government in an attempt to find some plausible excuse to disregard this legal reality had consulted the Swiss Reformed cantons of Zürich, Bern, Basel and Schaffhausen. They universally favoured his condemnation and the suppression of his doctrine, but without saying how either should be accomplished. Martin Luther had also condemned his writings in strong terms. Servetus and Philip Melanchthon had strongly hostile views of each other. The party called the &quot;Libertines&quot;, who were generally opposed to anything and everything that Calvin supported, were in this case strongly in favour of the execution of Servetus at the stake, while Calvin urged that he be beheaded. In fact, the council that condemned Servetus was presided over by Ami Perrin (a Libertine) who ultimately on 24 October sentenced Servetus to death by burning for denying the Trinity and infant baptism. Calvin and other ministers asked that he be beheaded instead of burned, knowing that burning at the stake was the only legal recourse. This plea was refused, and on 27 October, Servetus was burnt alive atop a pyre of his own books at the Plateau of Champel at the edge of Geneva. Historians record his last words as: &quot;Jesus, Son of the Eternal God, have mercy on me.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Sebastian Castellio and countless others denounced this execution and became harsh critics of Calvin because of the whole affair.

Some other anti-trinitarian thinkers began to be more cautious in expressing their views: Martin Cellarius, Lelio Sozzini and others either ceased writing or wrote only in private. The fact that Servetus was dead meant that his writings could be distributed more widely, though others such as Giorgio Biandrata developed them in their own names.

The writings of Servetus influenced the beginnings of the Unitarian movement in Poland and Transylvania. Peter Gonesius&#x27;s advocacy of Servetus&#x27; views led to the separation of the Polish brethren from the Calvinist Reformed Church in Poland, and laid the foundations for the Socinian movement which fostered the early Unitarians in England like John Biddle.

==Theology==
In his first two books (&quot;De trinitatis erroribus&quot;, and &quot;Dialogues on the Trinity&quot;, plus the supplementary &quot;De Iustitia Regni Christi&quot;), Servetus rejected the classical conception of the Trinity, stating that it was not based on the Bible. He argued that it arose from the teachings of Greek philosophers and advocated a return to the simplicity of the Gospels and the teachings of the early Church Fathers that he believed predated the development of Nicene Trinitarianism. Servetus hoped that the dismissal of the trinitarian dogma would make Christianity more appealing to believers in Judaism and Islam, which had preserved the unity of God in their teachings. According to Servetus, trinitarians had turned Christianity into a form of &quot;tritheism&quot;, or belief in three gods. Servetus affirmed that the divine &quot;Logos&quot;—the manifestation of God and not a separate divine Person—was incarnated as a human being (Jesus) when God&#x27;s spirit came into the womb of the Virgin Mary. Only from the moment of conception was the Son (i.e., the Logos) actually generated. Therefore, though the Logos he was formed from was eternal, the Son was not himself eternal. For this reason, Servetus always rejected calling Jesus the &quot;eternal Son of God&quot; but rather called him &quot;the Son of the eternal God.&quot;

In describing Servetus&#x27;s view of the Logos, Andrew Dibb explained: &quot;In &#x27;Genesis&#x27; God reveals himself as the creator. In &#x27;John&#x27; he reveals that he created by means of the Word, or Logos. Finally, also in &#x27;John&#x27;, he shows that this Logos became flesh and &#x27;dwelt among us&#x27;. Creation took place by the spoken word, for God said &quot;Let there be ...&quot; The spoken word of Genesis, the Logos of John, and the Christ, are all one and the same.&quot;

In his &quot;Treatise Concerning the Divine Trinity&quot;, Servetus taught that the Logos was the reflection of the Christ—&quot;That reflection of Christ was &#x27;the Word with God&quot; that consisted of God himself, shining brightly in Heaven, &quot;and it was God Himself&quot;—and that &quot;the Word was the very essence of God or the manifestation of God&#x27;s essence, and there was in God no other substance or hypostasis than His Word, in a bright cloud where God then seemed to subsist. And in that very spot the face and personality of Christ shone bright.&quot;

Unitarian scholar Earl Morse Wilbur states: &quot;Servetus&#x27; &quot;Errors of the Trinity&quot; is hardly heretical in intent, rather is suffused with passionate earnestness, warm piety, an ardent reverence for Scripture, and a love for Christ so mystical and overpowering that [he] can hardly find words to express it ... Servetus asserted that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit were dispositions of God, and not separate and distinct beings.&quot; Wilbur promotes the idea that Servetus was a modalist.

Servetus states his view clearly in the preamble to &quot;Restoration of Christianity&quot; (1553): &quot;There is nothing greater, reader, than to recognize that God has been manifested as substance, and that His divine nature has been truly communicated. We shall clearly apprehend the manifestation of God through the Word and his communication through the Spirit, both of them substantially in Christ alone.&quot;

His theology, though original in some respects, has often been compared to Adoptionism, Arianism, and Sabellianism, all of which trinitarians rejected in favour of the belief that God exists eternally in three distinct persons. Nevertheless, Servetus rejected the above theologies in his books. Adoptionism, because it denied Jesus&#x27;s divinity; Arianism, because it multiplied the hypostases and established a rank; and Sabellianism, because it seemingly confused the Father with the Son, though Servetus seems to have denied or diminished the distinctions between the Persons of the Godhead, rejecting the Trinitarian understanding of one God in three Persons.
The incomprehensible God is known through Christ, by faith, rather than by philosophical speculations. He manifests God to us, being the expression of His very being, and through him alone, God can be known. The scriptures reveal Him to those who have faith; and thus we come to know the Holy Spirit as the Divine impulse within us.

Under severe pressure from Catholics and Protestants alike, Servetus clarified this explanation in his second book—&quot;Dialogues&quot; (1532)—to show the Logos as coterminous with Jesus. He was nevertheless accused of heresy because of his insistence on denying the dogma of the Trinity and the distinctions between the three divine Persons in one God.

=== Theology ===
Because of his rejection of the Trinity and eventual execution by burning for heresy, Unitarians often regard Servetus as the first (modern) Unitarian martyr—though he was a Unitarian in neither the 17th-century sense of the term nor the contemporary sense. Sharply critical though he was of the orthodox formulation of the Trinity, Servetus is better described as a highly unorthodox trinitarian.

Aspects of his thinking—his critique of existing trinitarian theology, his devaluation of the doctrine of original sin, and his examination of Biblical proof-texts—did influence those who later inspired or founded unitarian churches in Poland and Transylvania.

Other nontrinitarian groups, such as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and the Oneness Pentecostals, also claim Servetus held similar nontrinitarian views as theirs. Oneness Pentecostalism particularly identifies with Servetus&#x27;s teaching on the divinity of Jesus and his insistence on the oneness of God, rather than a Trinity of three distinct persons: &quot;And because His Spirit was wholly God He is called God, just as from His flesh He is called man.&quot;

Oneness Pentecostal scholar David K. Bernard has written the following regarding the theology of Michael Servetus: &quot;... some historians consider him to be a motivating force for the development of Unitarianism. However, he definitely was not Unitarian, for he acknowledged Jesus as God.&quot;

Swedenborg wrote a systematic theology that had many similarities to the theology of Servetus.

Servetus also declared baptism of babies &quot;diabolical&quot;. He denied the concept of original sin and also denied the Holy Trinity. He compares it to the three-headed Cerberus from the ancient Greek myths. Other beliefs he had were that Jesus was a human that had become divine rather than being God&#x27;s eternal son.

=== Freedom of conscience ===
The widespread aversion to the death of Servetus has been interpreted as a significant moment in the emergence of the idea of religious tolerance in Europe. This principle has become increasingly important to modern Unitarian Universalists, surpassing the significance of antitrinitarianism. The Spanish scholar on Servetus&#x27; work, Ángel Alcalá, identified the radical search for truth and the right for freedom of conscience as Servetus&#x27; main legacies, rather than his theology. The Polish-American scholar Marian Hillar has studied the evolution of freedom of conscience, from Servetus and the Polish Socinians, to John Locke, and to Thomas Jefferson and the American Declaration of Independence. According to Hillar: &quot;Historically speaking, Servetus died so that freedom of conscience could become a civil right in modern society.&quot;

=== Science ===
Servetus was the first European to describe the function of pulmonary circulation, though his achievement was not widely recognized at the time for a few reasons. One was that the description appeared in a theological treatise, &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot;, not in a book on medicine. However, the sections in which he refers to anatomy and medicines demonstrate an amazing understanding of the body and treatments. Most copies of the book were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of the persecution of Servetus by religious authorities. Three copies survived, but these remained hidden for decades. In passage V, Servetus recounts his discovery that the blood of the pulmonary circulation flows from the heart to the lungs (rather than air in the lungs flowing to the heart as had been thought). His discovery was based on the colour of the blood, the size and location of the different ventricles, and the fact that the pulmonary vein was extremely large, which suggested that it performed intensive and transcendent exchange. However, Servetus does not only deal with cardiology. In the same passage, from pages 169 to 178, he also refers to the brain, the cerebellum, the meninges, the nerves, the eye, the tympanum, the rete mirabile, etc., demonstrating a great knowledge of anatomy. In some other sections of this work he also talks of medical products.

Servetus also contributed enormously to medicine with other published works specifically related to the field, such as his &quot;Complete Explanation of Syrups&quot; and his study on syphilis in his &quot;Apology against Leonhart Fuchs&quot;, among others.

=== Honours ===

==== Geneva ====
In Geneva, remembering Servetus was still a controversial issue 350 years after his execution. In 1903, supporters of Servetus formed a committee to erect a monument in his honour. The group was led by a French senator Auguste Dide, the author of a book on heretics and revolutionaries published in 1887. The committee commissioned a local sculptor named Clotilde Roch to create a statue showing a suffering Servetus. The work was three years in the making and finished in 1907. However, by then, supporters of Calvin in Geneva, having heard about the project, had already erected a simple stele in memory of Servetus in 1903, the main text of which served more as an apologetic for Calvin:
Duteous and grateful followers of Calvin our great Reformer, yet condemning an error which was that of his age, and strongly attached to liberty of conscience according to the true principles of his Reformation and gospel, we have erected this expiatory monument. Oct. 27, 1903 About the same time, a short street close by the stele was named after him.
The city council then rejected the request of the committee to erect the completed statue because there was already a monument to Servetus. The committee then offered the statue to the neighbouring French town of Annemasse, which in 1908 placed it in front of the city hall with the following inscriptions:
&quot;The arrest of Servetus in Geneva, where he did neither publish nor dogmatize, hence he was not subject to its laws, has to be considered as a barbaric act and an insult to the Right of Nations&quot;. Voltaire
&quot;I beg you, shorten please these deliberations. It is clear that Calvin for his pleasure wishes to make me rot in this prison. The lice eat me alive. My clothes are torn and I have nothing for a change, nor shirt, only a worn out vest&quot;.
Servetus, 1553
In 1942, the Vichy Government took down the statue, as it was a celebration of freedom of conscience, and melted it. In 1960, having found the original molds, Annemasse had it recast and returned the statue to its previous place.

Finally, on 3 October 2011, Geneva erected a copy of the statue which it had rejected over 100 years before. It was cast in Aragon from the molds of Clotilde Roch&#x27;s original statue. Rémy Pagani, former mayor of Geneva, inaugurated the statue. He previously had described Servetus as &quot;the dissident of dissidence.&quot; Representatives from the Roman Catholic Church in Geneva and the Director of Geneva&#x27;s International Museum of the Reformation attended the ceremony. A Geneva newspaper noted the absence of officials from the National Protestant Church of Geneva, the church of John Calvin.

==== Aragon ====
In 1984, the Zaragoza public hospital changed its name from &quot;José Antonio&quot; to &quot;Miguel Servet&quot;. Since 1999, this hospital has been known as the &quot;Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet&quot;, in recognition of its association with Servetus&#x27; own University of Zaragoza

== Works ==
Only the dates of the first editions are included.

*1531 &quot;On the Errors of the Trinity. De Trinitatis Erroribus.&quot; Haguenau printed by Hans Setzer. Without imprint mark or mark of printer, nor the city in which it was printed. Signed as Michael Servete alias Revés, from Aragon, Spanish. Written in Latin, it also includes words in Greek and in Hebrew in the body of the text whenever he wanted to stress the original meaning of a word from Scripture. 
*1532 &quot;Dialogues on the Trinity. Dialogorum de Trinitate libri duo.&quot; Haguenau, printed by Hans Setzer. Without imprint mark or mark of printer, nor the city where it was printed. Signed as Michael Serveto alias Revés, from Aragon, Spanish.
*1535 &quot;Geography of Claudius Ptolemy. Claudii Ptolemaeii Alexandrinii Geographicae enarrationis libri octo&quot;. Lyon, Trechsel. Signed as Michel de Villeneuve. Servetus dedicated this work to Hugues de la Porte. The second edition was dedicated to Pierre Palmier. Michel de Villeneuve states that the basis of his edition comes from the work of Bilibald Pirkheimer, who translated this work from Greek to Latin, but Michel also affirms that he also compared it to the primitive Greek texts. The 19th-century expert in Servetus, Henri Tollin (1833–1902), considered him to be &quot;the father of comparative geography&quot; due to the extension of his notes and commentaries.
*1536 &quot;The Apology against Leonard Fuchs. In Leonardum Fucsium Apologia.&quot; Lyon, printed by Gilles Hugetan, with Parisian prologue. Signed as Michel de Villeneuve. The physician Leonhart Fuchs and a friend of Michael Servetus, Symphorien Champier, got involved in an argument &quot;via&quot; written works, on their different Lutheran and Catholic beliefs. Servetus defends his friend in the first parts of the work. In the second part he talks of a medical plant and its properties. In the last part he writes on different topics, such as the defense of a pupil attacked by a teacher, and the origin of syphilis.
*1537 &quot;Complete Explanation of the Syrups. Syruporum universia ratio&quot;. Paris, printed by Simon de Colines. Signed as Michael de Villeneuve. This work consists of a prologue &quot;The Use of Syrups&quot;, and 5 chapters: I &quot;What the concoction is and why it is unique and not multiple&quot;, II &quot;What the things that must be known are&quot;, III &quot;That the concoction is always..&quot;, IV &quot;Exposition of the aphorisms of Hippocrates&quot; and V &quot;On the composition of syrups&quot;. Michel de Villeneuve refers to experiences of using the treatments, and to pharmaceutical treatises and terms more deeply described in his later pharmacopeia &quot;Enquiridion&quot; or &quot;Dispensarium&quot;. Michel mentions two of his teachers, Sylvius and Andernach, but above all, Galen. This work had a strong impact in those times.
*1538 &quot;Apologetic discourse of Michel de Villeneuve in favour of Astrology and against a certain physician. Michaelis Villanovani in quedam medicum apologetica disceptatio pro Astrologia.&quot; Paris, unknown printer. Servetus denounces Jean Tagault, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, for attacking astrology, while many great thinkers and physicians praised it. He lists reasonings of Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates and Galen, how the stars are related to some aspects of a patient&#x27;s health, and how a good physician can predict effects by them: the effect of the moon and sun on the sea, the winds and rains, the period of women, the speed of the decomposition of the corpses of beasts, etc.
*1542 &quot;Holy Bible according to the translation of Santes Pagnino. Biblia sacra ex Santes Pagnini tralation, hebraist.&quot; Lyon, edited by Delaporte and printed by Trechsel. The name Michel de Villeneuve appears in the prologue, the last time this name would appear in any of his works.
*1542 &quot;Biblia sacra ex postremis doctorum&quot; (octavo). Vienne in Dauphiné, edited by Delaporte and printed by Trechsel. Anonymous.
*1545 &quot;Holy Bible with commentaries. Biblia Sacra cum Glossis.&quot; Lyon, printed by Trechsel and Vincent. Called &quot;Ghost Bible&quot; by scholars who denied its existence. There is an anonymous work from this year that was edited in accordance with the contract that Miguel de Villeneuve made with the Company of Booksellers in 1540. The work consists of 7 volumes (6 volumes and an index) illustrated by Hans Holbein. This research was carried out by the scholar Julien Baudrier in the sixties. Recently scholar González Echeverría has graphically proved the existence of this work, and demonstrating that contrary to what experts Barón and Hillard thought, this work is also anonymous.
*&quot;Manuscript of Paris&quot; (c. 1546). This document is a draft of the &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot;. Written in Latin, it includes a few quotes in Greek and Hebrew. This work has paleographically the same handwriting as the &quot;Manuscript of the Complutense&quot;.
*1553 &quot;The Restoration of Christianity. Cristianismi Restitutio&quot;. Vienne, printed by Baltasar Arnoullet. Without imprint mark or mark of printer, nor the city in which it was printed. Signed as M.S.V. at the colophon though &quot;Servetus&quot; name is mentioned inside, in a fictional dialog. Servetus uses Biblical quotes in Greek and in Hebrew on its cover and in the body of the text whenever he wanted to stress the original meaning of a word from Scripture.

=== Servetus&#x27;s anonymous editions ===
In 1553, Lyonese printer Jean Frellon confessed to the French Inquisition that Michael Servetus had been working at his print shop, and had translated for him, among other works, several Latin grammar treatises to Spanish, and a  &quot;somme espagnole&quot;. New studies reveal Servetus as the author of an additional set of anonymous editions of grammatical, medical and Biblical works —exactly like his &quot;Biblia cum glossis&quot; from 1545 —which came from that print shop. These works were not completely original, but enriched and commented editions of previous works by other authors, much like what Servetus had done with his &quot;Geography of Ptolemy&quot; (1535). These works were anonymous due to four reasons: (the main one) the strong penalty Servetus got from the University of Paris, through its Medicine, Law and Theology Faculties; the fact that these works had references to authors who were forbidden in the Spanish Empire, and opposed by the Sorbonne Faculty of Theology, such as Erasmus and Robert Estienne; the fact that some other authors mentioned by these works, such as Mathurin Cordier and Robert Estienne, were at the same time very close to John Calvin; the prohibition of any Biblical translation into any common language, pushed by the Spanish Empire. The main  works which Servetus edited at Jean Frellon’s print shop were:

*  1543 &quot;Disticha de moribus nomine Catonis&quot;, Lyon, printed by Jean and François Frellon. One of the several Latin grammar treatises to Spanish, originally authored by Erasmus and Mathurin Cordier.
* 1543 &quot;Retratos o tablas de las Historias del Testamento Viejo&quot;, Lyon, printed by Jean and François Frellon. The Spanish &quot;sommes&quot; or summaries of specific chapters from the Old Testament. Originally printed in 1538 at Lyon by Melchior &amp; Gaspard Trechsel, with woodcuts by Hans Holbein (&quot;Icones&quot;). There had been also a French edition in 1539. In this Spanish edition Servetus included a poem for each of the 92 woodcuts.
* 1543 &quot;Dioscorides&quot;, Lyon, printed by Jean and François Frellon. This work was a &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;, originally authored by Pedanius Dioscorides, and edited by the eminent Dr. Jean Ruel from Paris. Servetus added 20 long commentaries and 277 marginalia. There is also a different edition (or &quot;homage edition&quot;) of this &quot;Dioscorides&quot; which was published in 1554, a year after Servetus’s execution. In this 1554 edition printers B. Arnoullet, Frellon, Vincent and G. Rouillé included some of Servetus&#x27; comments from the 1543 &quot;Dioscorides&quot;, and added signed comments by Andrea Mattioli. In addition, there seems to be an extensive manuscript by Servetus related to this Dioscorides of 1543: a copy of a 1537 &quot;Dioscorides&quot; published by Dionisus Corronius, which Servetus used as a workbook for developing his medical ideas while he was a medical student in Paris and Montpelier. The copy is kept at the Complutesian University, in Madrid.
* 1543 &quot;Enchiridion. Dispensarium vulgo vocant&quot;, Lyon, printed by Jean and François Frellon. A pharmacological formulas handbook. Its previous edition had been completed by Thibault Lespleigney &amp; François Chappuis. Servetus added 224 new formulas, credited 21 of them to his teacher prof. Sylvius, and also revealed some personal anecdotes regarding this professor. This is the twin work of 1543 Dioscorides, which formed a set for simples &amp; compounds handbook.
* 1549 &quot;De octo orationis partium constructione&quot;, Lyon, printed by Jean Frellon. One of the Latin grammar treatises to Spanish, previously edited by Colet, Lily, Erasmus, and Junien Ranvier —Robert Estienne’s print corrector.
* 1548–1550 A Giuntina edition of &quot;Galen’s Opera Omnia&quot;, Lyon, printed by Jean Frellon. A massive philological revision of Galen&#x27;s works, in 6 volumes. Its first edition had been published by printer Giunta in Venice.
* 1551 &quot;Biblia Sacrosancta veteris et Novi Testamenti&quot;, Lyon, printed by Jean Frellon. In this Bible edition, Servetus included an expanded version of his own commentaries from the 1542 &quot;Holy Bible according to the translation of Santes Pagnino&quot;.

<doc id="191404" wikidata="Q3085248" url="?curid=191404" title="Para table tennis">
<text>Para table tennis is a parasports which follows the rules set by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). The usual table tennis rules are in effect with slight modifications for wheelchair athletes. Athletes from disability groups can take part. Athletes receive classifications between 1 and 11. Classes 1–5 are for those in wheelchairs and classes 6–10 for those who have disabilities that allow them to play standing. Within those groups, the higher classification means the more function the athlete has. Class 11 is defined for players with an intellectual disability.

==Classification==

The roles of classification are to determine eligibility to compete for athletes with disability and to group athletes equitably for competition purposes. Athletes are grouped by reference to functional ability, resulting from their impairment.

===Sitting classes===
*Class 1:No sitting balance with severe reduction of function in the playing arm.
*Class 2:No sitting balance with reduction of function in the playing arm.
*Class 3:No sitting balance, although the upper part of the trunk may show activity.Normal arms, although some slight motor losses can be found in the playing hand without significant effect on table tennis skills.The non-playing arm keeps the trunk in position.
*Class 4:Existing sitting balance although not optimal because of non-existing anchorage (stabilisation) of the pelvis.
*Class 5:Normal function of trunk muscles.

===Standing classes===

*Class 6:Severe impairments of legs and arms.
*Class 7:Very severe impairments of legs (poor static and dynamic balance), orsevere to moderate impairments of playing arm, orcombination of arms and legs impairments less severe than in class 6.
*Class 8:Moderate impairments of the legs, ormoderate impairments of playing arm (considering that elbow and shoulder control is very important), ormoderate cerebral palsy, hemiplegia or diplegia with good playing arm.
*Class 9:Mild impairments of the leg(s), ormild impairments of playing arm, orsevere impairments of non-playing arm, ormild cerebral palsy with hemiparesis or monoplegia.
*Class 10:Very mild impairments in legs, orvery mild impairment of playing arm, orsevere to moderate impairment of non-playing arm, ormoderate impairment of the trunk.
*Class 11:For players with an intellectual disability.

==Laws of table tennis in wheelchair==
There are no exceptions to the laws of table tennis for standing players with a disability. All players play according to the laws and regulations of the ITTF. The umpire may relax the requirements for a correct service if the compliance is prevented by physical disability.

===Service===
If the receiver is in wheelchair, the service shall be a let under the following circumstances:
# After touching the receiver&#x27;s court, the ball returns in the direction of the net.
# The ball comes to rest on the receiver&#x27;s court.
# In singles, the ball leaves the receiver&#x27;s court after touching it by either of its sidelines.

If the receiver strikes the ball before it crosses a sideline or takes a second bounce on his or her side of the playing surface, the service is considered good and no let is called.

===Doubles===
When two players who are in wheelchairs are a pair playing doubles, the server shall first make a service, the receiver shall then make a return but thereafter either player of the disabled pair may make returns. However, no part of a player&#x27;s wheelchair shall protrude beyond the imaginary extension of the center line of the table. If it does, the umpire shall award the point to the opposing pair.

===Limb positions===
If both players or pairs are in a wheelchair, the player or the pair score a point if:
# the opponent does not maintain a minimum contact with the seat or cushion(s), with the back of the thigh, when the ball is struck.
# the opponent touches the table with either hand before striking the ball.
# the opponent&#x27;s footrest or foot touches the floor during play.

===Wheelchairs===
Wheelchairs must have at least two large wheels and one small wheel. If the wheels on the player&#x27;s wheelchair become dislodged and the wheelchair has no more than two wheels, then the rally must be stopped immediately and a point awarded to their opponent.

The height of one or maximum two cushions is limited to 15 cm in playing conditions with no other addition to the wheelchair. In team and class events, no part of the body above the knees may be attached to the chair as this could improve balance.

==Equipment and playing conditions==
A player may not normally wear any part of a tracksuit during play. A player with a physical disability, either in a wheelchair or standing, may wear the trousers portion of a tracksuit during play, but jeans are not permitted.

Table legs shall be at least 40 cm from the end line of the table for wheelchair players. In international competitions, the playing space is not less than 14m long, 7m wide and the flooring shall not be concrete. The space for wheelchair events may be reduced to 8m long and 6m wide. The flooring may be of concrete for wheelchair events, which is prohibited on other occasions.

==Competitions==
5 levels of international competitions are sanctioned. Factor of the tournament is counted in the tournament credit system used for qualification purpose of some tournaments. Players participate in regional championships (Fa50) earn 50 credit points. The tournament credit for the 2012 Summer Paralympics is 80 credit points must be met during a period starting on 4 November 2010 until 31 December 2011. It&#x27;s also required a minimum tournament credit for the qualification of World Para Table Tennis Championships.
==Notable players==

* Ibrahim Hamadtou, an Egyptian Class 6 Champion, is one of the most well-known Paralympic table tennis players, since his YouTube video went viral. Hamadtou has won many awards, including silver medals in African Para table tennis Championships held in 2013 and 2011. He holds his racket with his mouth.
* Natalia Partyka, a Four-time Olympian, participates in Class 10 events at the para table tennis tournaments, representing Poland. Born without a right hand and forearm, she participates in competitions for able-bodied athletes as well as in competitions for athletes with disabilities. Partyka reached the last 32 of the London 2012 Olympic women&#x27;s table tennis.

<doc id="191413" wikidata="Q1756543" url="?curid=191413" title="Multiple dispatch">
<text>Multiple dispatch or multimethods is a feature of some programming languages in which a function or method can be dynamically dispatched based on the run-time (dynamic) type or, in the more general case, some other attribute of more than one of its arguments. This is a generalization of single-dispatch polymorphism where a function or method call is dynamically dispatched based on the derived type of the object on which the method has been called. Multiple dispatch routes the dynamic dispatch to the implementing function or method using the combined characteristics of one or more arguments.

== Understanding dispatch ==
Developers of computer software typically organize source code into named blocks variously called subroutines, procedures, subprograms, functions, or methods. The code in the function is executed by &quot;calling&quot; it – executing a piece of code that references its &quot;name&quot;. This transfers control temporarily to the called function; when the function&#x27;s execution has completed, control is typically transferred back to the instruction in the &quot;caller&quot; that follows the reference.

Function names are usually selected so as to be descriptive of the function&#x27;s purpose. It is sometimes desirable to give several functions the same name, often because they perform conceptually similar tasks, but operate on different types of input data. In such cases, the name reference at the function call site is not sufficient for identifying the block of code to be executed. Instead, the number and type of the arguments to the function call are also used to select among several function implementations.

In more conventional, i.e., single-dispatch object-oriented programming languages, when invoking a method (&quot;sending a message&quot; in Smalltalk, &quot;calling a member function&quot; in C++), one of its arguments is treated specially and used to determine which of the (potentially many) classes of methods of that name is to be applied. In many languages, the &quot;special&quot; argument is indicated syntactically; for example, a number of programming languages put the special argument before a dot in making a method call: codice_1, so that codice_2 would produce a roar, whereas codice_3 would produce a chirp.

In contrast, in languages with multiple dispatch, the selected method is simply the one whose arguments match the number and type of the function call. There is no &quot;special&quot; argument that &quot;owns&quot; the function/method carried out in a particular call.

Multiple dispatch should be distinguished from function overloading, in which static typing information, such as a term&#x27;s declared or inferred type (or base type in a language with subtyping) is used to determine which of several possibilities will be used at a given call site, and that determination is made at compile or link time (or some other time before program execution starts) and is thereafter invariant for a given deployment or run of the program. Many languages such as C++ offer robust function overloading but do not offer dynamic multiple dispatch (C++ only permits dynamic single dispatch through use of virtual functions).

=== Data types ===
When working with languages that can discriminate data types at compile time, selecting among the alternatives can occur then. The act of creating such alternative functions for compile time selection is usually referred to as overloading a function.

In programming languages that defer data type identification until run time (i.e., late binding), selection among alternative functions must occur then, based on the dynamically determined types of function arguments. Functions whose alternative implementations are selected in this manner are referred to most generally as &quot;multimethods&quot;.

There is some run-time cost associated with dynamically dispatching function calls. In some languages, the distinction between overloading and multimethods can be blurred, with the compiler determining whether compile time selection can be applied to a given function call, or whether slower run time dispatch is needed.

=== Issues ===

There are several known issues with dynamic-dispatch, both single and multiple. While many of these issues are solved for single-dispatch, which has been a standard feature in object-oriented programming languages for decades, these issues become more complicated in the multiple-dispatch case.

====Expressiveness and modularity====

In most popular programming languages, source code is delivered and deployed in granules of functionality which we will here call &quot;packages&quot;; actual terminology for this concept varies between language. Each package may contain multiple type, value, and function definitions, packages are often compiled separately in languages with a compilation step, and a non-cyclical dependency relationship may exist. A complete program is a set of packages, with a &quot;main package&quot; which may depend on several other packages, and the whole program consisting of the transitive closure of the dependency relationship.

The so-called expression problem relates to the ability for code in a depending package to extend behaviors (functions or datatypes) defined in a base package from within an including package, without modifying the source to the base package. Traditional single-dispatch OO languages make it trivial to add new datatypes but not new functions; traditional functional languages tend to have the opposite effect, and multiple dispatch, if implemented correctly, allows both. It is desirable for an implementation of multiple dispatch to have the following properties:

* It is possible to define different &quot;cases&quot; of a multi-method from within different packages without modifying the source of a base package.
* Inclusion of another package in the program should not change the behavior of a given multi-method call, when the call does not use any datatypes defined in the package.
* Conversely, if a datatype is defined in a given package, and a multi-method extension using that type is also defined in the same package, and a value of that type is passed (through a base type reference or into a generic function) into another package with no dependency on that package, and then the multi-method is invoked with that value as an argument, the multi-method case defined in the package which includes the type should be employed. To put it another way—within a given program, the same multi-method invoked with the same set of arguments should resolve to the same implementation, regardless of the location of the call site, and whether or not a given definition is &quot;in scope&quot; or &quot;visible&quot; at the point of the method call.

====Ambiguity====

It is generally desirable that for any given invocation of a multi-method, there be at most one &quot;best&quot; candidate among implementation cases of the multi-method, and/or that if there is not, that this be resolved in a predictable and deterministic fashion, including failure. Non-deterministic behavior is undesirable. Assuming a set of types with a non-circular subtyping relationship, one can define that one implementation of a multi-method is &quot;better&quot; (more specific) if all dynamically-dispatched arguments in the first are subtypes of all dynamically-dispatched arguments specified in the second, and at least one is a strict subtype. With single dispatch and in the absence of multiple inheritance, this condition is trivially satisfied, but with multiple dispatch, it is possible for two or more candidates to satisfy a given actual argument list, but neither is more specific than the other (one dynamic argument being the subtype in one case, another being the subtype in the other case). This particularly can happen if two different packages, neither depending on the other, both extend some multi-method with implementations concerning each package&#x27;s types, and then a third package that includes both (possibly indirectly) then invokes the multi-method using arguments from both packages.

Possible resolutions include:

* Treating any ambiguous calls as an error. This might be caught at compile time (or otherwise before deployment), but might not be detected until runtime and produce a runtime error.
* Ordering the arguments, so e.g. the case with the most specific first argument is selected, and subsequent arguments are not considered for ambiguity resolution unless the first argument is insufficient to resolve the issue.
* Construction of other rules for resolving an ambiguity in one direction or another. Sometimes, such rules might be arbitrary and surprising. In the rules for static overload resolution in C++, for instance, a type which matches exactly is understandably considered a better match than a type which matches through a base type reference or a generic (template) parameter. However, if the only possible matches are either through a base type or a generic parameter, the generic parameter is preferred over the base type, a rule that sometimes produces surprising behavior.

====Efficiency====

Efficient implementation of single-dispatch, including in programming languages that are separately compiled to object code and linked with a low-level (not-language-aware) linker, including dynamically at program load/start time or even under the direction of the application code, are well known. The &quot;vtable&quot; method developed in C++ and other early OO languages (where each class has an array of function pointers corresponding to that class&#x27;s virtual functions) is nearly as fast as a static method call, requiring O(1) overhead and only one additional memory lookup even in the un-optimized case. However, the vtable method uses the function name and not the argument type as its lookup key, and does not scale to the multiple dispatch case. (It also depends on the object-oriented paradigm of methods being features of classes, not standalone entities independent of any particular datatype).

Efficient implementation of multiple-dispatch remains an ongoing research problem.

=== Use in practice ===
To estimate how often multiple dispatch is used in practice, Muschevici et al. studied programs that use dynamic dispatch. They analyzed nine applications, mostly compilers, written in six different languages: Common Lisp Object System, Dylan, Cecil, MultiJava, Diesel, and Nice. Their results show that 13–32% of generic functions use the dynamic type of one argument, while 2.7–6.5% of them use the dynamic type of multiple arguments. The remaining 65–93% of generic functions have one concrete method (overrider), and thus are not considered to use the dynamic types of their arguments. Further, the study reports that 2–20% of generic functions had two and 3–6% had three concrete function implementations. The numbers decrease rapidly for functions with more concrete overriders.

Multiple dispatch is used much more heavily in Julia, where multiple dispatch was a central design concept from the origin of the language: collecting the same statistics as Muschevici on the average number of methods per generic function, it was found that the Julia standard library uses more than double the amount of overloading than in the other languages analyzed by Muschevici, and more than 10 times in the case of binary operators.

The data from these papers is summarized in the following table, where the dispatch ratio codice_4 is the average number of methods per generic function; the choice ratio codice_5 is the mean of the square of the number of methods (to better measure the frequency of functions with a large number of methods); and the degree of specialization codice_6 is the average number of type-specialized arguments per method (i.e., the number of arguments that are dispatched on):

=== Theory ===
The theory of multiple dispatching languages was first developed by Castagna et al., by defining a model for overloaded functions with late binding. It yielded the first formalization of the problem of covariance and contravariance of object-oriented languages and a solution to the problem of binary methods.

Distinguishing multiple and single dispatch may be made clearer by an example. Imagine a game that has, among its (user-visible) objects, spaceships and asteroids. When two objects collide, the program may need to do different things according to what has just hit what.

=== Languages with built-in multiple dispatch ===

==== C# ====
C# introduced support for dynamic multimethods in version 4 (April 2010) using the &#x27;dynamic&#x27; keyword. The following example demonstrates multimethods. Like many other statically-typed languages, C# also supports static method overloading. Microsoft expects that developers will choose static typing over dynamic typing in most scenarios. The &#x27;dynamic&#x27; keyword supports interoperability with COM objects and dynamically-typed .NET languages.

The example below uses features introduced in C# 9 and C# 10.
using static ColliderLibrary;

Console.WriteLine(Collide(new Asteroid(101), new Spaceship(300)));
Console.WriteLine(Collide(new Asteroid(10), new Spaceship(10)));
Console.WriteLine(Collide(new Spaceship(101), new Spaceship(10)));

string Collide(SpaceObject x, SpaceObject y) =&gt;
 x.Size &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; y.Size &gt; 100
 ? &quot;Big boom!&quot;
 : CollideWith(x as dynamic, y as dynamic); // Dynamic dispatch to CollideWith method

class ColliderLibrary
 public static string CollideWith(Asteroid x, Asteroid y) =&gt; &quot;a/a&quot;;
 public static string CollideWith(Asteroid x, Spaceship y) =&gt; &quot;a/s&quot;;
 public static string CollideWith(Spaceship x, Asteroid y) =&gt; &quot;s/a&quot;;
 public static string CollideWith(Spaceship x, Spaceship y) =&gt; &quot;s/s&quot;;

abstract record SpaceObject(int Size);
record Asteroid(int Size) : SpaceObject(Size);
record Spaceship(int Size) : SpaceObject(Size);
Output:

Big boom!
a/s
s/s
==== Groovy ====
Groovy is a general purpose Java compatible/interusable JVM language, which, contrary to Java, uses late binding / multiple dispatch.
/*
 Groovy implementation of C# example above
 Late binding works the same when using non-static methods or compiling class/methods statically
 (@CompileStatic annotation)
class Program {
 static void main(String[] args) {
 println Collider.collide(new Asteroid(101), new Spaceship(300))
 println Collider.collide(new Asteroid(10), new Spaceship(10))
 println Collider.collide(new Spaceship(101), new Spaceship(10))
}

class Collider {
 static String collide(SpaceObject x, SpaceObject y) {
 (x.size &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; y.size &gt; 100) ? &quot;big-boom&quot; : collideWith(x, y) // Dynamic dispatch to collideWith method

 private static String collideWith(Asteroid x, Asteroid y) { &quot;a/a&quot; }
 private static String collideWith(Asteroid x, Spaceship y) { &quot;a/s&quot; }
 private static String collideWith(Spaceship x, Asteroid y) { &quot;s/a&quot; }
 private static String collideWith(Spaceship x, Spaceship y) { &quot;s/s&quot;}

class SpaceObject {
 int size
 SpaceObject(int size) { this.size = size }

@InheritConstructors class Asteroid extends SpaceObject {}
@InheritConstructors class Spaceship extends SpaceObject {}
==== Common Lisp ====
In a language with multiple dispatch, such as Common Lisp, it might look more like this (Common Lisp example shown):
(defmethod collide-with ((x asteroid) (y asteroid))
 ;; deal with asteroid hitting asteroid
(defmethod collide-with ((x asteroid) (y spaceship))
 ;; deal with asteroid hitting spaceship
(defmethod collide-with ((x spaceship) (y asteroid))
 ;; deal with spaceship hitting asteroid
(defmethod collide-with ((x spaceship) (y spaceship))
 ;; deal with spaceship hitting spaceship


and similarly for the other methods. Explicit testing and &quot;dynamic casting&quot; are not used.

In the presence of multiple dispatch, the traditional idea of methods as being defined in classes and contained in objects becomes less appealing—each &quot;collide-with&quot; method above is attached to two different classes, not one. Hence, the special syntax for method invocation generally disappears, so that method invocation looks exactly like ordinary function invocation, and methods are grouped not in classes but in generic functions.

==== Julia ====
Julia has built-in multiple dispatch, and it is central to the language design. The Julia version of the example above might look like:
abstract type SpaceObject end

struct Asteroid &lt;: SpaceObject
 size::Int 
end
struct Spaceship &lt;: SpaceObject
 size::Int 
end

collide_with(::Asteroid, ::Spaceship) = &quot;a/s&quot;
collide_with(::Spaceship, ::Asteroid) = &quot;s/a&quot;
collide_with(::Spaceship, ::Spaceship) = &quot;s/s&quot;
collide_with(::Asteroid, ::Asteroid) = &quot;a/a&quot;

collide(x::SpaceObject, y::SpaceObject) = (x.size &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; y.size &gt; 100) ? &quot;Big boom!&quot; : collide_with(x, y)
Output:

julia&gt; collide(Asteroid(101), Spaceship(300))
&quot;Big boom!&quot;

julia&gt; collide(Asteroid(10), Spaceship(10))
&quot;a/s&quot;

julia&gt; collide(Spaceship(101), Spaceship(10))
&quot;s/s&quot;
==== Raku ====
Raku, like Perl, uses proven ideas from other languages, and type systems have shown themselves to offer compelling advantages in compiler-side code analysis and powerful user-side semantics via multiple dispatch.

It has both multimethods, and multisubs. Since most operators are subroutines, it also has multiple dispatched operators.

Along with the usual type constraints, it also has &quot;where&quot; constraints that allow making very specialized subroutines.
subset Mass of Real where 0 ^..^ Inf; 
role Stellar-Object {
 has Mass $.mass is required;
 method name () returns Str {...};
class Asteroid does Stellar-Object {
 method name () { &#x27;an asteroid&#x27; }
class Spaceship does Stellar-Object {
 has Str $.name = &#x27;some unnamed spaceship&#x27;;
my Str @destroyed = &lt; obliterated destroyed mangled &gt;;
my Str @damaged = « damaged &#x27;collided with&#x27; &#x27;was damaged by&#x27; »;

# We add multi candidates to the numeric comparison operators because we are comparing them numerically,
# but makes no sense to have the objects coerce to a Numeric type.
# ( If they did coerce we wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need to add these operators. )
# We could have also defined entirely new operators this same way.
multi sub infix:« &lt;=&gt; » ( Stellar-Object:D $a, Stellar-Object:D $b ) { $a.mass &lt;=&gt; $b.mass }
multi sub infix:« &lt; » ( Stellar-Object:D $a, Stellar-Object:D $b ) { $a.mass &lt; $b.mass }
multi sub infix:« &gt; » ( Stellar-Object:D $a, Stellar-Object:D $b ) { $a.mass &gt; $b.mass }
multi sub infix:« == » ( Stellar-Object:D $a, Stellar-Object:D $b ) { $a.mass == $b.mass }

# Define a new multi dispatcher, and add some type constraints to the parameters.
# If we didn&#x27;t define it we would have gotten a generic one that didn&#x27;t have constraints.
proto sub collide ( Stellar-Object:D $, Stellar-Object:D $ ) {*}

# No need to repeat the types here since they are the same as the prototype.
# The &#x27;where&#x27; constraint technically only applies to $b not the whole signature.
# Note that the &#x27;where&#x27; constraint uses the `&lt;` operator candidate we added earlier.
multi sub collide ( $a, $b where $a &lt; $b ) {
 say &quot;$a.name() was @destroyed.pick() by $b.name()&quot;;
multi sub collide ( $a, $b where $a &gt; $b ) {
 # redispatch to the previous candidate with the arguments swapped
 samewith $b, $a;

# This has to be after the first two because the other ones
# have &#x27;where&#x27; constraints, which get checked in the
# order the subs were written. ( This one would always match. )
multi sub collide ( $a, $b ) {
 # randomize the order
 my ($n1, $n2) = ( $a.name, $b.name ).pick(*);
 say &quot;$n1 @damaged.pick() $n2&quot;;

# The following two candidates can be anywhere after the proto,
# because they have more specialized types than the preceding three.

# If the ships have unequal mass one of the first two candidates gets called instead.
multi sub collide ( Spaceship $a, Spaceship $b where $a == $b ){
 my ($n1, $n2) = ( $a.name, $b.name ).pick(*);
 say &quot;$n1 collided with $n2, and both ships were &quot;,
 ( @destroyed.pick, &#x27;left damaged&#x27; ).pick;

# You can unpack the attributes into variables within the signature.
# You could even have a constraint on them `(:mass($a) where 10)`.
multi sub collide ( Asteroid $ (:mass($a)), Asteroid $ (:mass($b)) ){
 say &quot;two asteroids collided and combined into one larger asteroid of mass { $a + $b }&quot;;

my Spaceship $Enterprise .= new(:mass(1),:name(&#x27;The Enterprise&#x27;));
collide Asteroid.new(:mass(.1)), $Enterprise;
collide $Enterprise, Spaceship.new(:mass(.1));
collide $Enterprise, Asteroid.new(:mass(1));
collide $Enterprise, Spaceship.new(:mass(1));
collide Asteroid.new(:mass(10)), Asteroid.new(:mass(5));
=== Extending languages with multiple-dispatch libraries ===

==== JavaScript ====
In languages that do not support multiple dispatch at the language definition or syntactic level, it is often possible to add multiple dispatch using a library extension. JavaScript and TypeScript do not support multimethods at the syntax level, but it is possible to add multiple dispatch via a library. For example, the &quot;multimethod package&quot; provides an implementation of multiple dispatch, generic functions.

Dynamically-typed version in JavaScript:
import { multi, method } from &#x27;@arrows/multimethod&#x27;

class Asteroid {}
class Spaceship {}

const collideWith = multi(
 method([Asteroid, Asteroid], (x, y) =&gt; {
 // deal with asteroid hitting asteroid
 method([Asteroid, Spaceship], (x, y) =&gt; {
 // deal with asteroid hitting spaceship
 method([Spaceship, Asteroid], (x, y) =&gt; {
 // deal with spaceship hitting asteroid
 method([Spaceship, Spaceship], (x, y) =&gt; {
 // deal with spaceship hitting spaceship
)
Statically-typed version in TypeScript:
import { multi, method, Multi } from &#x27;@arrows/multimethod&#x27;

class Asteroid {}
class Spaceship {}

type CollideWith = Multi &amp; {
 (x: Asteroid, y: Asteroid): void
 (x: Asteroid, y: Spaceship): void
 (x: Spaceship, y: Asteroid): void
 (x: Spaceship, y: Spaceship): void

const collideWith: CollideWith = multi(
 method([Asteroid, Asteroid], (x, y) =&gt; {
 // deal with asteroid hitting asteroid
 method([Asteroid, Spaceship], (x, y) =&gt; {
 // deal with asteroid hitting spaceship
 method([Spaceship, Asteroid], (x, y) =&gt; {
 // deal with spaceship hitting asteroid
 method([Spaceship, Spaceship], (x, y) =&gt; {
 // deal with spaceship hitting spaceship
)
==== Python ====
Multiple dispatch can be added to Python using a library extension. For example, using the module &quot;multimethod.py&quot; and also with the module &quot;multimethods.py&quot; which provides CLOS-style multimethods for Python without changing the underlying syntax or keywords of the language.
from multimethods import Dispatch
from game_objects import Asteroid, Spaceship
from game_behaviors import as_func, ss_func, sa_func

collide = Dispatch()
collide.add_rule((Asteroid, Spaceship), as_func)
collide.add_rule((Spaceship, Spaceship), ss_func)
collide.add_rule((Spaceship, Asteroid), sa_func)

def aa_func(a, b):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Behavior when asteroid hits asteroid.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 # ...define new behavior...

collide.add_rule((Asteroid, Asteroid), aa_func)

# ...later...
collide(thing1, thing2)
Functionally, this is very similar to the CLOS example, but the syntax is conventional Python.

Using Python 2.4 decorators, Guido van Rossum produced a sample implementation of multimethods with a simplified syntax:
@multimethod(Asteroid, Asteroid)
def collide(a, b):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Behavior when asteroid hits a asteroid.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 # ...define new behavior...
@multimethod(Asteroid, Spaceship)
def collide(a, b):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Behavior when asteroid hits a spaceship.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 # ...define new behavior...
# ... define other multimethod rules ...

and then it goes on to define the multimethod decorator.

The PEAK-Rules package provides multiple dispatch with a syntax similar to the above example. It was later replaced by PyProtocols.

The Reg library also supports multiple and predicate dispatch.

With the introduction of type hints, multiple dispatch is possible with even simpler syntax. For example, using plum-dispatch,
from plum import dispatch

@dispatch
def collide(a: Asteroid, b: Asteroid):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Behavior when asteroid hits a asteroid.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 # ...define new behavior...
@dispatch
def collide(a: Asteroid, b: Spaceship):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Behavior when asteroid hits a spaceship.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 # ...define new behavior...
# ...define further rules...
=== Emulating multiple dispatch ===

==== C ====
C does not have dynamic dispatch, so it must be implemented manually in some form. Often an enum is used to identify the subtype of an object. Dynamic dispatch can be done by looking up this value in a function pointer branch table. Here is a simple example in C:
typedef void (*CollisionCase)(void);

void collision_AA(void) { /* handle Asteroid-Asteroid collision */ };
void collision_AS(void) { /* handle Asteroid-Spaceship collision */ };
void collision_SA(void) { /* handle Spaceship-Asteroid collision */ };
void collision_SS(void) { /* handle Spaceship-Spaceship collision*/ };

typedef enum {
 THING_ASTEROID = 0,
 THING_SPACESHIP,
 THING_COUNT /* not a type of thing itself, instead used to find number of things */
} Thing;

CollisionCase collisionCases[THING_COUNT][THING_COUNT] = {
 {&amp;collision_AA, &amp;collision_AS},
 {&amp;collision_SA, &amp;collision_SS}

void collide(Thing a, Thing b) {
 (*collisionCases[a][b])();

int main(void) {
 collide(THING_SPACESHIP, THING_ASTEROID);


With the C Object System library, C does support dynamic dispatch similar to CLOS. It is fully extensible and does not need any manual handling of the methods. Dynamic message (methods) are dispatched by the dispatcher of COS, which is faster than Objective-C. Here is an example in COS:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cos/Object.h&gt;
#include &lt;cos/gen/object.h&gt;

// classes

defclass (Asteroid)
// data members
endclass

defclass (Spaceship)
// data members
endclass

// generics

defgeneric (_Bool, collide_with, _1, _2);

// multimethods

defmethod (_Bool, collide_with, Asteroid, Asteroid)
 // deal with asteroid hitting asteroid
endmethod

defmethod (_Bool, collide_with, Asteroid, Spaceship)
 // deal with asteroid hitting spaceship
endmethod

defmethod (_Bool, collide_with, Spaceship, Asteroid)
 // deal with spaceship hitting asteroid
endmethod

defmethod (_Bool, collide_with, Spaceship, Spaceship)
 // deal with spaceship hitting spaceship
endmethod

// example of use

int main(void)
 OBJ a = gnew(Asteroid);
 OBJ s = gnew(Spaceship);

 printf(&quot;&lt;a,a&gt; = %d\n&quot;, collide_with(a, a));
 printf(&quot;&lt;a,s&gt; = %d\n&quot;, collide_with(a, s));
 printf(&quot;&lt;s,a&gt; = %d\n&quot;, collide_with(s, a));
 printf(&quot;&lt;s,s&gt; = %d\n&quot;, collide_with(s, s));

 grelease(a);
 grelease(s);


==== C++ ====
, C++ natively supports only single dispatch, though adding multi-methods (multiple dispatch) was proposed by Bjarne Stroustrup (and collaborators) in 2007. The methods of working around this limit are analogous: use either the visitor pattern, dynamic cast or a library:
 // Example using run time type comparison via dynamic_cast

 struct Thing {
 virtual void collideWith(Thing&amp; other) = 0;

 struct Asteroid : Thing {
 void collideWith(Thing&amp; other) {
 // dynamic_cast to a pointer type returns NULL if the cast fails
 // (dynamic_cast to a reference type would throw an exception on failure)
 if (auto asteroid = dynamic_cast&lt;Asteroid*&gt;(&amp;other)) {
 // handle Asteroid-Asteroid collision
 } else if (auto spaceship = dynamic_cast&lt;Spaceship*&gt;(&amp;other)) {
 // handle Asteroid-Spaceship collision
 } else {
 // default collision handling here
 }

 struct Spaceship : Thing {
 void collideWith(Thing&amp; other) {
 if (auto asteroid = dynamic_cast&lt;Asteroid*&gt;(&amp;other)) {
 // handle Spaceship-Asteroid collision
 } else if (auto spaceship = dynamic_cast&lt;Spaceship*&gt;(&amp;other)) {
 // handle Spaceship-Spaceship collision
 } else {
 // default collision handling here
 }


or pointer-to-method lookup table:
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;typeinfo&gt;
#include &lt;unordered_map&gt;

class Thing {
 protected:
 Thing(std::uint32_t cid) : tid(cid) {}
 const std::uint32_t tid; // type id

 typedef void (Thing::*CollisionHandler)(Thing&amp; other);
 typedef std::unordered_map&lt;std::uint64_t, CollisionHandler&gt; CollisionHandlerMap;

 static void addHandler(std::uint32_t id1, std::uint32_t id2, CollisionHandler handler) {
 collisionCases.insert(CollisionHandlerMap::value_type(key(id1, id2), handler));
 static std::uint64_t key(std::uint32_t id1, std::uint32_t id2) {
 return std::uint64_t(id1) « 32 | id2;

 static CollisionHandlerMap collisionCases;

 public:
 void collideWith(Thing&amp; other) {
 auto handler = collisionCases.find(key(tid, other.tid));
 if (handler != collisionCases.end()) {
 (this-&gt;*handler-&gt;second)(other); // pointer-to-method call
 } else {
 // default collision handling
 }

class Asteroid: public Thing {
 void asteroid_collision(Thing&amp; other) { /*handle Asteroid-Asteroid collision*/ }
 void spaceship_collision(Thing&amp; other) { /*handle Asteroid-Spaceship collision*/}

 public:
 Asteroid(): Thing(cid) {}
 static void initCases();
 static const std::uint32_t cid;

class Spaceship: public Thing {
 void asteroid_collision(Thing&amp; other) { /*handle Spaceship-Asteroid collision*/}
 void spaceship_collision(Thing&amp; other) { /*handle Spaceship-Spaceship collision*/}

 public:
 Spaceship(): Thing(cid) {}
 static void initCases();
 static const std::uint32_t cid; // class id

Thing::CollisionHandlerMap Thing::collisionCases;
const std::uint32_t Asteroid::cid = typeid(Asteroid).hash_code();
const std::uint32_t Spaceship::cid = typeid(Spaceship).hash_code();

void Asteroid::initCases() {
 addHandler(cid, cid, CollisionHandler(&amp;Asteroid::asteroid_collision));
 addHandler(cid, Spaceship::cid, CollisionHandler(&amp;Asteroid::spaceship_collision));

void Spaceship::initCases() {
 addHandler(cid, Asteroid::cid, CollisionHandler(&amp;Spaceship::asteroid_collision));
 addHandler(cid, cid, CollisionHandler(&amp;Spaceship::spaceship_collision));

int main() {
 Asteroid::initCases();
 Spaceship::initCases();

 Asteroid a1, a2;
 Spaceship s1, s2;

 a1.collideWith(a2);
 a1.collideWith(s1);

 s1.collideWith(s2);
 s1.collideWith(a1);


The &quot;YOMM2&quot; library provides a fast, orthogonal implementation of open multimethods.

The syntax for declaring open methods is inspired by a proposal for a native C++ implementation. The library requires that the user registers all the classes used as virtual arguments (and their sub-classes), but does not require any modifications to existing code. Methods are implemented as ordinary inline C++ functions; they can be overloaded and they can be passed by pointer. There is no limit on the number of virtual arguments, and they can be arbitrarily mixed with non-virtual arguments.

The library uses a combination of techniques (compressed dispatch tables, collision free integer hash table) to implement method calls in constant time, while mitigating memory usage. Dispatching a call to an open method with a single virtual argument takes only 15–30% more time than calling an ordinary virtual member function, when a modern optimizing compiler is used.

The Asteroids example can be implemented as follows:
#include &lt;yorel/yomm2/keywords.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;

class Thing {
 public:
 virtual ~Thing() {}

class Asteroid : public Thing {

class Spaceship : public Thing {

register_classes(Thing, Spaceship, Asteroid);

declare_method(void, collideWith, (virtual_&lt;Thing&amp;&gt;, virtual_&lt;Thing&amp;&gt;));

define_method(void, collideWith, (Thing&amp; left, Thing&amp; right)) {
 // default collision handling

define_method(void, collideWith, (Asteroid&amp; left, Asteroid&amp; right)) {
 // handle Asteroid-Asteroid collision

define_method(void, collideWith, (Asteroid&amp; left, Spaceship&amp; right)) {
 // handle Asteroid-Spaceship collision

define_method(void, collideWith, (Spaceship&amp; left, Asteroid&amp; right)) {
 // handle Spaceship-Asteroid collision

define_method(void, collideWith, (Spaceship&amp; left, Spaceship&amp; right)) {
 // handle Spaceship-Spaceship collision

int main() {
 yorel::yomm2::update_methods();

 std::unique_ptr&lt;Thing&gt; a1(std::make_unique&lt;Asteroid&gt;()),
 a2(std::make_unique&lt;Asteroid&gt;());
 std::unique_ptr&lt;Thing&gt; s1(std::make_unique&lt;Spaceship&gt;()),
 s2(std::make_unique&lt;Spaceship&gt;());
 // note: types partially erased

 collideWith(*a1, *a2); // Asteroid-Asteroid collision
 collideWith(*a1, *s1); // Asteroid-Spaceship collision
 collideWith(*s1, *a1); // Spaceship-Asteroid collision
 collideWith(*s1, *s2); // Spaceship-Spaceship collision

 return 0;


Stroustrup mentions in &quot;The Design and Evolution of C++&quot; that he liked the concept of multimethods and considered implementing it in C++ but claims to have been unable to find an efficient sample implementation (comparable to virtual functions) and resolve some possible type ambiguity problems. He then states that although the feature would still be nice to have, that it can be approximately implemented using double dispatch or a type based lookup table as outlined in the C/C++ example above so is a low priority feature for future language revisions.

==== D ====
, as do many other object-oriented programming languages, D natively supports only single dispatch. However, it is possible to emulate open multimethods as a library function in D. The &quot;openmethods&quot; library is an example.
// Declaration
Matrix plus(virtual!Matrix, virtual!Matrix);

// The override for two DenseMatrix objects
@method
Matrix _plus(DenseMatrix a, DenseMatrix b)
 const int nr = a.rows;
 const int nc = a.cols;
 assert(a.nr == b.nr);
 assert(a.nc == b.nc);
 auto result = new DenseMatrix;
 result.nr = nr;
 result.nc = nc;
 result.elems.length = a.elems.length;
 result.elems[] = a.elems[] + b.elems[];
 return result;

// The override for two DiagonalMatrix objects
@method
Matrix _plus(DiagonalMatrix a, DiagonalMatrix b)
 assert(a.rows == b.rows);
 double[] sum;
 sum.length = a.elems.length;
 sum[] = a.elems[] + b.elems[];
 return new DiagonalMatrix(sum);


==== Java ====
In a language with only single dispatch, such as Java, multiple dispatch can be emulated with multiple levels of single dispatch:


interface Collideable {
 void collideWith(final Collideable other);

 /* These methods would need different names in a language without method overloading. */
 void collideWith(final Asteroid asteroid);
 void collideWith(final Spaceship spaceship);

class Asteroid implements Collideable {
 public void collideWith(final Collideable other) {
 // Call collideWith on the other object.
 other.collideWith(this);

 public void collideWith(final Asteroid asteroid) {
 // Handle Asteroid-Asteroid collision.

 public void collideWith(final Spaceship spaceship) {
 // Handle Asteroid-Spaceship collision.
}

class Spaceship implements Collideable {
 public void collideWith(final Collideable other) {
 // Call collideWith on the other object.
 other.collideWith(this);

 public void collideWith(final Asteroid asteroid) {
 // Handle Spaceship-Asteroid collision.

 public void collideWith(final Spaceship spaceship) {
 // Handle Spaceship-Spaceship collision.
}
Run time codice_7 checks at one or both levels can also be used.

<text>The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) is the facility for object-oriented programming in ANSI Common Lisp. CLOS is a powerful dynamic object system which differs radically from the OOP facilities found in more static languages such as C++ or Java. CLOS was inspired by earlier Lisp object systems such as MIT Flavors and CommonLoops, although it is more general than either. Originally proposed as an add-on, CLOS was adopted as part of the ANSI standard for Common Lisp and has been adapted into other Lisp dialects such as EuLisp or Emacs Lisp.

== Features ==
The basic building blocks of CLOS are methods, classes, instances of those classes, and generic functions.
CLOS provides macros to define those: codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3. Instances are created with the method codice_4.

Classes can have multiple superclasses, a list of slots (member variables in C++/Java parlance) and a special metaclass. Slots can be allocated by class (all instances of a class share the slot) or by instance. Each slot has a name and the value of a slot can be accessed by that name using the function codice_5. Additionally special generic functions can be defined to write or read values of slots. Each slot in a CLOS class must have a unique name.

CLOS is a multiple dispatch system. This means that methods can be specialized upon any or all of their required arguments. Most OO languages are single-dispatch, meaning that methods are only specialized on the first argument. Another unusual feature is that methods do not &quot;belong&quot; to classes; classes do not provide a namespace for generic functions or methods. Methods are defined separately from classes, and they have no special access (e.g. &quot;this&quot;, &quot;self&quot;, or &quot;protected&quot;) to class slots.

Methods in CLOS are grouped into generic functions. A generic function is an object which is callable like a function and which associates a collection of methods with a shared name and argument structure, each specialized for different arguments. Since Common Lisp provides non-CLOS classes for structures and built-in data types (numbers, strings, characters, symbols, ...), CLOS dispatch works also with these non-CLOS classes. CLOS also supports dispatch over individual objects (eql specializers). CLOS does not by default support dispatch over all Common Lisp data types (for example dispatch does not work for fully specialized array types or for types introduced by codice_6). However, most Common Lisp implementations provide a metaobject protocol which allows generic functions to provide application specific specialization and dispatch rules.

Dispatch in CLOS is also different from most OO languages:

# Given a list of arguments, a list of applicable methods is determined.
# This list is sorted according to the specificity of their parameter specializers.
# Selected methods from this list are then combined into an effective method using the method combination used by the generic function.
# The effective method is then called with the original arguments.

This dispatch mechanism works at runtime. Adding or removing methods thus may lead to changed effective methods (even when the generic function is called with the same arguments) at runtime. Changing the method combination also may lead to different effective methods.

For example,

; Declare the common argument structure prototype.
(defgeneric f (x y))

; Define an implementation for (f integer y), where y matches all types.
(defmethod f ((x integer) y)
 1)

(f 1 2.0) =&gt; 1

; Define an implementation for (f integer real).
(defmethod f ((x integer) (y real))
 2)

(f 1 2.0) =&gt; 2 ;Dispatch changed at runtime.
Like the OO systems in most dynamic languages, CLOS does not enforce encapsulation. Any slot can be accessed using the codice_5 function or via (optionally auto-generated) accessor methods. To access it via codice_5 you have to know the name of the slot. CL programmers use the language&#x27;s package facility to declare which functions or data structures are intended for export.

Apart from normal (&quot;primary&quot;) methods, there also are codice_9, codice_10, and codice_11 &quot;auxiliary&quot; methods. The former two are invoked prior to, or after the primary method, in a particular order based on the class hierarchy. An codice_11 method can control whether the primary method is executed at all. Additionally, the programmer can specify whether all possible primary methods along the class hierarchy should be called or just the one providing the closest match.

The &quot;Standard Method-Combination&quot; provides the primary, before, after and around methods explained above. There are other Method-Combinations with other method types. New (both simple and complex) Method-Combinations and method types can be defined.

CLOS allows multiple inheritance. When the default order in which methods are executed in multiple inheritance is not correct, the programmer may resolve the diamond inheritance problems by specifying the order of method combinations.

CLOS is dynamic, meaning that not only the contents, but also the &quot;structure&quot; of its objects can be modified at runtime. CLOS supports changing class definitions on-the-fly (even when instances of the class in question already exist) as well as changing the class membership of a given instance through the codice_13 operator. CLOS also allows one to add, redefine and remove methods at runtime. The Circle-Ellipse Problem is readily solved in CLOS, and most OOP design patterns either disappear or are qualitatively simpler.

CLOS is not a prototype language: classes must be defined before objects can be instantiated as members of that class.

== Metaobject Protocol ==
Outside of the ANSI Common Lisp standard, there is a widely implemented extension to CLOS called the Metaobject Protocol (MOP). The MOP defines a standard interface to the underpinnings of the CLOS implementation, treating classes, slot-descriptions, generic-functions and methods themselves as instances of metaclasses, and allows the definition of new metaclasses and the modification of all CLOS behavior. The flexibility of the CLOS MOP prefigures aspect-oriented programming, which was later developed by some of the same engineers, such as Gregor Kiczales. The MOP defines the behavior of the whole object system by a set of protocols. These are defined in terms of CLOS. Thus it is possible to create new object-systems by extending or changing the provided CLOS functionality. The book The Art of the Metaobject Protocol describes the use and implementation of the CLOS MOP.

The various Common Lisp implementations have slightly different support for the Meta-Object Protocol. The &quot;Closer&quot; project aims to provide the missing features.

== Influences from older Lisp-based object systems ==
Flavors (and its successor New Flavors) was the object system on the MIT Lisp Machine. Large parts of the Lisp Machine operating systems and many applications for it use Flavors or New Flavors. Flavors introduced multiple inheritance and mixins, among other features. Flavors is mostly obsolete, though implementations for Common Lisp do exist. Flavors was using the message passing paradigm. New Flavors introduced generic functions.

CommonLoops was the successor of LOOPS (from Xerox Interlisp-D). CommonLoops was implemented for Common Lisp. A portable implementation called Portable CommonLoops (PCL) was the first implementation of CLOS. PCL is widely ported and still provides the base for the CLOS implementation of several Common Lisp implementations. PCL is implemented mostly in portable Common Lisp with only a few system dependent parts.

== CLOS in other programming languages ==
Because of the power and expressivity of CLOS, as well as the historical availability of Tiny CLOS (a simplified portable CLOS implementation written by Gregor Kiczales for use with Scheme), CLOS-like MOP-based object systems have become the &quot;de facto&quot; norm in most Lisp dialect implementations, as well as finding their way into some other languages&#x27; OOP facilities:

* COS, the C Object System
* Dylan
* Dynace, a (largely) CLOS implementation in C
* EIEIO for Emacs Lisp
* Gauche, Scheme with CLOS
* GOOPS in GNU Guile
* ILOS in ISLISP
* Meroon, an Object System in Scheme
* Sagittarius, a Scheme with CLOS
* ScmObj, for Scheme
* SOS for MIT Scheme
* STklos, a Scheme with CLOS
* Swindle in Racket
* COOPS in Chicken Scheme
* VCLOS for Skill
* Tiny CLOS
* S4 classes in S and R programming languages

<text>Ernst Kuno Berthold Fischer (; ; 23 July 1824 – 5 July 1907) was a German philosopher, a historian of philosophy and a critic.

==Biography==

After studying philosophy at Leipzig and Halle,
he became a privatdocent at Heidelberg in 1850. The Baden government in 1853 laid an embargo on his teaching owing to his liberal ideas, but the effect of this was to rouse considerable sympathy for his views, and in 1856 he obtained a professorship at Jena, where he soon acquired great influence by the dignity of his personal character. In 1872, on Eduard Zeller&#x27;s move to Berlin, Fischer succeeded him as professor of philosophy and the history of modern German literature at Heidelberg.

He was a brilliant lecturer and possessed a remarkable gift for clear exposition. His fame rests primarily on his work as a historian and commentator of philosophy. As far as his philosophical views were concerned, he was, generally speaking, a follower of the Hegelian school. His writings in this direction, especially his interpretation of Kant, involved him in a quarrel with F. A. Trendelenburg, professor of philosophy at the University of Berlin, and his followers. In 1860, Fischer&#x27;s &quot;Kants Leben und die Grundlagen seiner Lehre&quot; (Kant&#x27;s life and the foundations of his doctrine) lent the first real impulse to the so-called &quot;return to Kant&quot;.

In honor of his 80th birthday, celebrated in 1904, Otto Liebmann, Wilhelm Wundt, Theodor Lipps and others published &quot;Die Philosophie im Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts. Festschrift für Kuno Fischer&quot; (Heidelberg, 1907).

==Philosophy==
One of Fischer&#x27;s most significant and lasting contributions to philosophy was the use of the empiricism/rationalism distinction in categorising philosophers, particularly those of the 17th and 18th centuries. These include John Locke, George Berkeley and David Hume in the empiricist category and René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza and G.W. Leibniz in the rationalist category. Empiricism, it is said, claims that human knowledge is derived from sensation, i.e. experience, while rationalism claims that certain knowledge can be acquired before experience through pure principles. Although influential, in more recent times this distinction has been questioned as anachronistic in its failure to represent precisely the exact claims and methodologies of the philosophers it categorises.

==Reception==
Kuno Fischer&#x27;s &quot;History of Modern Philosophy&quot; had a strong impact on Friedrich Nietzsche and his view on modern philosophy, particularly regarding Spinoza. Frege and W. Somerset Maugham were amongst his students.

Hermann Weyl, writing about pre-WWII academic life in Germany, told the following anecdote about Fischer:

:A little anecdote of German university life in the nineties may illustrate the point. Kuno Fischer, a second-rate philosopher at Heidelberg, was one day disturbed by the noise of workers who were putting in new cobblestones in the street before his house. He had at that time been offered a professorship in Berlin. So he opened his window and shouted to the workmen, &quot;If you don&#x27;t stop that noise at once, I&#x27;ll accept the call to Berlin&quot;. Whereupon the foreman ran to the mayor, he summoned the Stadtbaumeister and they decided to postpone repair of the street until after the beginning of the academic vacation.

<text>Samuel Renshaw (1892–1981) was an American psychologist whose work became famous for a short period of time during World War II when he taught sailors to identify enemy aircraft in a split second, using tachistoscopic training. He generally worked with fast-reading and enhancing the latent ability of the mind. He believed that most people used only one-fifth of their available mind-power to process information. By using methods of flashing pages he produced students who could read as fast as 1,200 to 1,400 words per minute.

Renshaw became involved in the establishment of the Midwestern Psychological Association and served as the organization&#x27;s Secretary-Treasurer in 1929. For his contributions to the war effort the United States Navy awarded him the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award in 1955. He wrote 23 volumes of a journal &quot;Visual Psychology&quot;.

Robert A. Heinlein depicted the technique in several of his works, including &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; (1957) and &quot;Gulf&quot; (1949); and mentioned Renshaw in the context of the training of Fair Witnesses in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961). He cited a &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; article on Renshaw&#x27;s studies for responses to fan mail about the subject.

This technique and equipment appeared at the Ravenswood School District (near Stanford University) for a short time in the 1960s. Several young students took part in the experiment, which involved film-strip readers and page-at-a-glance equipment.

The &quot;Renshaw Training System for Aircraft and Ship Recognition&quot; is considered to have &quot;saved untold lives during World War II&quot;.

<doc id="191422" wikidata="Q5532672" url="?curid=191422" title="Generic function">
<text>In computer programming, a generic function is a function defined for polymorphism.

== In statically typed languages ==
In statically typed languages (such as C++ and Java), the term &quot;generic functions&quot; refers to a mechanism for &quot;compile-time polymorphism&quot; (static dispatch), specifically parametric polymorphism. These are functions defined with TypeParameters, intended to be resolved with compile time type information. The compiler uses these types to instantiate suitable versions, resolving any function overloading appropriately.

== In Common Lisp Object System ==
In some systems for object-oriented programming such as the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) and Dylan, a &quot;generic function&quot; is an entity made up of all methods having the same name. Typically a &quot;generic function&quot; is an instance of a class that inherits both from &quot;function&quot; and &quot;standard-object&quot;. Thus generic functions are both functions (that can be called with and applied to arguments) and ordinary objects. The book &quot;The Art of the Metaobject Protocol&quot; explains the implementation and use of CLOS generic functions in detail.

One of the early object-oriented programming extensions to Lisp is Flavors. It used the usual message sending paradigm influenced by Smalltalk. The Flavors syntax to send a message is:
 (send object :message)
With New Flavors, it was decided the message should be a real function and the usual function calling syntax should be used:
 (message object)
&quot;message&quot; now is a &quot;generic function&quot;, an object and function in its own right. Individual implementations of the &quot;message&quot; are called &quot;methods&quot;.

The same idea was implemented in CommonLoops. New Flavors and CommonLoops were the main influence for the Common Lisp Object System.

== Example ==
=== Common Lisp ===
Define a generic function with two parameters object-1 and object-2. The name of the generic function is &quot;collide&quot;.

 (defgeneric collide (object-1 object-2))
Methods belonging to the generic function are defined outside of classes.
Here we define a method for the generic function &quot;collide&quot; which is specialized for the classes asteroid (first parameter object-1) and spaceship (second parameter object-2). The parameters are used as normal variables inside the method body. There is no special namespace that has access to class slots.

 (defmethod collide ((object-1 asteroid) (object-2 spaceship))
 (format t &quot;asteroid ~a collides with spaceship ~a&quot; object-1 object-2))
Calling the generic function:

? (collide (make-instance &#x27;asteroid) (make-instance &#x27;spaceship))
asteroid #&lt;ASTEROID 4020003FD3&gt; collides with spaceship #&lt;SPACESHIP 40200048CB&gt;
Common Lisp can also retrieve individual methods from the generic function. FIND-METHOD finds the method from the generic function &quot;collide&quot; specialized for the classes &quot;asteroid&quot; and &quot;spaceship&quot;.

? (find-method #&#x27;collide nil (list (find-class &#x27;asteroid) (find-class &#x27;spaceship)))
#&lt;STANDARD-METHOD COLLIDE NIL (ASTEROID SPACESHIP) 4150015E43&gt;
=== Comparison to other languages ===
Generic functions correspond roughly to what Smalltalk terms methods, with the notable exception that, in Smalltalk, the receiver&#x27;s class is the sole determinant of which body of code is called: the types or values of the arguments are irrelevant (single dispatch). In a programming language with multiple dispatch when a generic function is called, method dispatch occurs on the basis of all arguments, not just one which is privileged. New Flavors also provided generic functions, but only single dispatch.

In JavaScript, a generic function is a function that can work with values of different types, rather than a specific type. This is achieved through the use of type parameters or by dynamically checking the type of the value being operated on. One common use case for generic functions in JavaScript is to create reusable functions that can work with different data types, such as arrays, strings, or objects. JavaScript&#x27;s dynamic typing system makes it particularly suited for the creation of generic functions, as values can be easily coerced or converted to different types as needed.

<text>The terms Muslim world and Islamic world () commonly refer to the Islamic community, which is also known as the Ummah. This consists of all those who adhere to the religious beliefs, politics, and laws of Islam or to societies in which Islam is practiced. In a modern geopolitical sense, these terms refer to countries in which Islam is widespread, although there are no agreed criteria for inclusion. The term Muslim-majority countries is an alternative often used for the latter sense.

The history of the Muslim world spans about 1,400 years and includes a variety of socio-political developments, as well as advances in the arts, science, medicine, philosophy, law, economics and technology during the Islamic Golden Age. Muslims look for guidance to the Quran and believe in the prophetic mission of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, but disagreements on other matters have led to the appearance of different religious schools of thought and sects within Islam. The Islamic conquests, which culminated in the Caliphate being established across three continents (Asia, Africa, and Europe), enriched the Muslim world, achieving the economic preconditions for the emergence of this institution owing to the emphasis attached to Islamic teachings. In the modern era, most of the Muslim world came under European colonial domination. The nation states that emerged in the post-colonial era have adopted a variety of political and economic models, and they have been affected by secular as well as religious trends.

, the combined GDP (nominal) of 50 Muslim majority countries was US$5.7 trillion. , they contributed 8% of the world&#x27;s total. In 2020, the Economy of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation which consists of 57 member states had a combined GDP(PPP) of US$ 24 trillion which is equal to about 18% of world&#x27;s GDP or US$ 30 trillion with 5 OIC observer states which is equal to about 22% of the world&#x27;s GDP. Some OIC member countries -Ivory Coast, Guyana, Gabon, Mozambique, Nigeria, Suriname, Togo and Uganda are not Muslim-majority.

As of 2020, 1.8 billion or more than 25% of the world population are Muslims. By the percentage of the total population in a region considering themselves Muslim, 91% in the Middle East-North Africa (MENA), 89% in Central Asia, 40% in Southeast Asia, 31% in South Asia, 30% in Sub-Saharan Africa, 25% in Asia, 1.4% in Oceania, 6% in Europe, and 1% in the Americas.

Most Muslims are of one of two denominations: Sunni Islam (87–90%) and Shia (10–13%). However, other denominations exist in pockets, such as Ibadi (primarily in Oman). Muslims who do not belong to, do not self-identify with, or cannot be readily classified under one of the identifiable Islamic schools and branches are known as non-denominational Muslims. About 13% of Muslims live in Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country; % of Muslims live in South Asia, the largest population of Muslims in the world; % in the Middle East–North Africa, where it is the dominant religion; and 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa and West Africa (primarily in Nigeria). Muslims are the overwhelming majority in Central Asia, the majority in the Caucasus, and widespread in Southeast Asia. India has the largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries. Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, and Egypt are home to the world’s second, fourth, sixth and seventh largest Muslim populations respectively. Sizeable Muslim communities are also found in the Americas, Russia, India, China, and Europe. Islam is the fastest-growing major religion in the world partially due to their high birth rate, according to the same study, religious switching has no impact on Muslim population, since the number of people who embrace Islam and those who leave Islam are roughly equal. China has the third largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries, while Russia has the fifth largest Muslim population. Nigeria has the largest Muslim population in Africa, while Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in Asia.
== Terminology ==
The term has been documented as early as 1912 to encompass the influence of perceived pan-Islamic propaganda. &quot;The Times&quot; described Pan-Islamism as a movement with power, importance, and cohesion born in Paris, where Turks, Arabs and Persians congregated. The correspondent&#x27;s focus was on India: it would take too long to consider the progress made in various parts of the Muslim world. The article considered the position of the Amir, the effect of the Tripoli Campaign, Anglo-Russian action in Persia, and &quot;Afghan Ambitions&quot;.

In a modern geopolitical sense, the terms &#x27;Muslim world&#x27; and &#x27;Islamic world&#x27; refer to countries in which Islam is widespread, although there are no agreed criteria for inclusion. Some scholars and commentators have criticised the term &#x27;Muslim/Islamic world&#x27; and its derivative terms &#x27;Muslim/Islamic country&#x27; as &quot;simplistic&quot; and &quot;binary&quot;, since no state has a religiously homogeneous population (e.g. Egypt&#x27;s citizens are c. 10% Christians), and in absolute numbers, there are sometimes fewer Muslims living in countries in which they make up the majority than in countries in which they form a minority. Moreover, the idea of a uniform Muslim world is imagined. Emerging in popular discourse in the nineteenth century, imperialists used the term to emphasize the civilizational differences between east and west. In opposition to colonization some Muslims started using the term in attempts at providing a unified front against western imperialism. Hence, the term &#x27;Muslim-majority countries&#x27; is often preferred in literature.

==History==


The history of the Islamic faith as a religion and social institution begins with its inception around 610 CE, when the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a native of Mecca, is believed by Muslims to have received the first revelation of the Quran, and began to preach his message. In 622 CE, facing opposition in Mecca, he and his followers migrated to Yathrib (now Medina), where he was invited to establish a new constitution for the city under his leadership. This migration, called the Hijra, marks the first year of the Islamic calendar. By the time of his death, Muhammad had become the political and spiritual leader of Medina, Mecca, the surrounding region, and numerous other tribes in the Arabian Peninsula.

After Muhammad died in 632, his successors (the Caliphs) continued to lead the Muslim community based on his teachings and guidelines of the Quran. The majority of Muslims consider the first four successors to be &#x27;rightly guided&#x27; or Rashidun. The conquests of the Rashidun Caliphate helped to spread Islam beyond the Arabian Peninsula, stretching from northwest India, across Central Asia, the Near East, North Africa, southern Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the Pyrenees. The Arab Muslims were unable to conquer the entire Christian Byzantine Empire in Asia Minor during the Arab–Byzantine wars, however. The succeeding Umayyad Caliphate attempted two failed sieges of Constantinople in 674–678 and 717–718. Meanwhile, the Muslim community tore itself apart into the rivalling Sunni and Shia sects since the killing of caliph Uthman in 656, resulting in a succession crisis that has never been resolved. The following First, Second and Third Fitnas and finally the Abbasid Revolution (746–750) also definitively destroyed the political unity of the Muslims, who have been inhabiting multiple states ever since. Ghaznavids&#x27; rule was succeeded by the Ghurid Empire of Muhammad of Ghor and Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad, whose reigns under the leadership of Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji extended until the Bengal, where South Asian Islamic missionaries achieved their greatest success in terms of dawah and number of converts to Islam. Qutb ud-Din Aibak conquered Delhi in 1206 and began the reign of the Delhi Sultanate, a successive series of dynasties that synthesized Indian civilization with the wider commercial and cultural networks of Africa and Eurasia, greatly increased demographic and economic growth in India and deterred Mongol incursion into the prosperous Indo-Gangetic Plain and enthroned one of the few female Muslim rulers, Razia Sultana.
Notable major empires dominated by Muslims, such as those of the Abbasids, Fatimids, Almoravids, Gao Empire, Seljukids, largest contiguous Songhai Empire (15th-16th centuries) of Sahel, West Africa, southern North Africa and western Central Africa which dominated the centers of Islamic knowledge of Timbuktu, Djenne, Oualata and Gao, Ajuran, Adal and Warsangali in Somalia, Mughals in the Indian subcontinent (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc.), Safavids in Persia and Ottomans in Anatolia, Massina Empire, Sokoto Caliphate of northern Nigeria, Toucouleur Empire, were among the influential and distinguished powers in the world. 19th-century colonialism and 20th-century decolonisation have resulted in several independent Muslim-majority states around the world, with vastly differing attitudes towards and political influences granted to, or restricted for, Islam from country to country. These have revolved around the question of Islam&#x27;s compatibility with other ideological concepts such as secularism, nationalism (especially Arab nationalism and Pan-Arabism, as opposed to Pan-Islamism), socialism (see also Arab socialism and socialism in Iran), democracy (see Islamic democracy), republicanism (see also Islamic republic), liberalism and progressivism, feminism, capitalism and more.

===Gunpowder empires===
Scholars often use the term Age of the Islamic Gunpowders to describe period the Safavid, Ottoman and Mughal states. Each of these three empires had considerable military exploits using the newly developed firearms, especially cannon and small arms, to create their empires. They existed primarily between the fourteenth and the late seventeenth centuries. During the 17th–18th centuries, when the Indian subcontinent was ruled by Mughal Empire&#x27;s sixth ruler Muhammad Auranzgeb through sharia and Islamic economics, India became the world&#x27;s largest economy, valued 25% of world GDP.

===Great Divergence===

The Great Divergence was the reason why European colonial powers militarily defeated preexisting Oriental powers like the Mughal Empire, starting from the wealthy Bengal Subah, Tipu Sultan&#x27;s Kingdom of Mysore, the Ottoman Empire and many smaller states in the pre-modern Greater Middle East, and initiated a period known as &#x27;colonialism&#x27;.

===Colonialism===

Beginning with the 15th century, colonialism by European powers profoundly affected Muslim-majority societies in Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Colonialism was often advanced by conflict with mercantile initiatives by colonial powers and caused tremendous social upheavals in Muslim-dominated societies.

A number of Muslim-majority societies reacted to Western powers with zealotry and thus initiating the rise of Pan-Islamism; or affirmed more traditionalist and inclusive cultural ideals; and in rare cases adopted modernity that was ushered by the colonial powers.

The only Muslim-majority regions not to be colonized by the Europeans were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan. Turkey was one of the first colonial powers of the world with the Ottoman empire ruling several states for over 6 centuries.

===Postcolonial era===
In the 20th century, the end of the European colonial domination has led to creation of a number of nation states with significant Muslim populations. These states drew on Islamic traditions to varying degree and in various ways in organizing their legal, educational and economic systems. The Times first documented the term &quot;Muslim world&quot; in 1912 when describing Pan-Islamism as a movement with power importance and cohesion born in Paris where Turks, Arabs and Persians congregated. The article considered The position of the Amir; the effect of the Tripoli Campaign; Anglo-Russian action in Persia; and &quot;Afghan Ambitions&quot;.

A significant change in the Muslim world was the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1922), to which the Ottoman officer and Turkish revolutionary statesman Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had an instrumental role in ending and replacing it with the Republic of Turkey, a modern, secular democracy (see Abolition of the Ottoman sultanate). The secular values of Kemalist Turkey, which separated religion from the state with the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924, have sometimes been seen as the result of Western influence.

In the 21st century, after the September 11 attacks (2001) coordinated by the Wahhabi Islamist terrorist group Al-Qaeda against the United States, scholars considered the ramifications of seeking to understand Muslim experience through the framework of secular Enlightenment principles. Muhammad Atta, one of the 11 September hijackers, reportedly quoted from the Quran to allay his fears: &quot;Fight them, and God will chastise them at your hands/And degrade them, and He will help you/Against them, and bring healing to the breasts of a people who believe&quot;, referring to the &quot;ummah&quot;, the community of Muslim believers, and invoking the imagery of the early warriors of Islam who lead the faithful from the darkness of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot;.

By Sayyid Qutb&#x27;s definition of Islam, the faith is &quot;a complete divorce from jahiliyyah&quot;. He complained that American churches served as centers of community social life that were &quot;very hard [to] distinguish from places of fun and amusement&quot;. For Qutb, Western society was the modern &quot;jahliliyyah&quot;. His understanding of the &quot;Muslim world&quot; and its &quot;social order&quot; was that, presented to the Western world as the result of practicing Islamic teachings, would impress &quot;by the beauty and charm of true Islamic ideology&quot;. He argued that the values of the Enlightenment and its related precursor, the Scientific Revolution, &quot;denies or suspends God&#x27;s sovereignty on earth&quot; and argued that strengthening &quot;Islamic character&quot;
was needed &quot;to abolish the negative influences of &quot;jahili&quot; life.&quot;

==Islam by country==


As the Muslim world came into contact with secular ideals, societies responded in different ways. Some Muslim-majority countries are secular. Azerbaijan became the first secular republic in the Muslim world, between 1918 and 1920, before it was incorporated into the Soviet Union. Turkey has been governed as a secular state since the reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. By contrast, the 1979 Iranian Revolution replaced a monarchial semi-secular regime with an Islamic republic led by the Ayatollah, Ruhollah Khomeini.

Some countries have declared Islam as the official state religion. In those countries, the legal code is largely secular. Only personal status matters pertaining to inheritance and marriage are governed by Sharia law. In some places, Muslims implement Islamic law, called sharia in Arabic. The Islamic law exists in a number of variations, called schools of jurisprudence. The Amman Message, which was endorsed in 2005 by prominent Islamic scholars around the world, recognized four Sunni schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i, Hanbali), two Shia schools (Ja&#x27;fari, Zaidi), the Ibadi school, and the Zahiri school.

====Muslim-minority states====
According to the Pew Research Center in 2015 there were 50 Muslim-majority countries, which are shown in the Government and religion section above in the article. Apart from these, large Muslim populations exist in some countries where Muslims are a minority, and their Muslim communities are larger than many Muslim-majority nations:
*: 200 million Muslims (14.6%)
*: 34.7 million Muslims (31.3%)
*: 25–40 million Muslims (2–3%)
*: 19.4 million Muslims (35.2%)
*: 14–20 million Muslims (10–14%)
*: 12 million Muslims (42%)
*: 10 million Muslims (15%)
*: 8–9 million Muslims (9–10%)

===Politics===

During much of the 20th century, the Islamic identity and the dominance of Islam on political issues have arguably increased during the early 21st century. The fast-growing interests of the Western world in Islamic regions, international conflicts and globalization have changed the influence of Islam on the world in contemporary history.

====Islamism====
==Demographics==

More than 24.1% of the world&#x27;s population is Muslim, with an estimated total of approximately 1.9 billion. Muslims are the majority in 49 countries, they speak hundreds of languages and come from diverse ethnic backgrounds. The city of Karachi has the largest Muslim population in the world. 

===Geography===
Because the terms &#x27;Muslim world&#x27; and &#x27;Islamic world&#x27; are disputed, since no country is homogeneously Muslim, and there is no way to determine at what point a Muslim minority in a country is to be considered &#x27;significant&#x27; enough, there is no consensus on how to define the Muslim world geographically. The only rule of thumb for inclusion which has some support, is that countries need to have a Muslim population of more than 50%. 

In 2010, 73% of the world&#x27;s Muslim population lived in countries where Muslims are in the majority, while 27% of the world&#x27;s Muslim population lived in countries where Muslims are in the minority. India&#x27;s Muslim population is the world&#x27;s largest Muslim-minority population in the world (11% of the world&#x27;s Muslim population). Jones (2005) defines a &quot;large minority&quot; as being between 30% and 50%, which described nine countries in 2000, namely Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, North Macedonia, and Tanzania. As of 2024, however, Nigeria has become a Muslim-majority country.

===Religion===
==== Islam ====
The two main denominations of Islam are the Sunni and Shia sects. They differ primarily upon of how the life of the ummah (&quot;faithful&quot;) should be governed, and the role of the imam. Sunnis believe that the true political successor of Muhammad according to the Sunnah should be selected based on ٍShura (consultation), as was done at the Saqifah which selected Abu Bakr, Muhammad&#x27;s father-in-law, to be Muhammad&#x27;s political but not his religious successor. Shia, on the other hand, believe that Muhammad designated his son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib as his true political as well as religious successor.

The overwhelming majority of Muslims in the world, between 87 and 90%, are Sunni. Shias and other groups make up the rest, about 10–13% of overall Muslim population. The countries with the highest concentration of Shia populations are: Iran – 89%, Azerbaijan – 65%, Iraq – 60%, Bahrain – 60%, Yemen – 35%, Turkey – 10%, Lebanon – 27%, Syria – 13%, Afghanistan – 10%, Pakistan – 10%, and India – 10%.

Non-denominational Muslims make up a majority of the Muslims in seven countries (and a plurality in three others): Albania (65%), Kyrgyzstan (64%), Kosovo (58%), Indonesia (56%), Mali (55%), Bosnia and Herzegovina (54%), Uzbekistan (54%), Azerbaijan (45%), Russia (45%), and Nigeria (42%). They are found primarily in Central Asia. Kazakhstan has the largest number of non-denominational Muslims, who constitute about 74% of the population. Southeastern Europe also has a large number of non-denominational Muslims.

The Kharijite Muslims, who are less known, have their own stronghold in the country of Oman holding about 75% of the population.

===== Islamic schools and branches =====
The first centuries of Islam gave rise to three major sects: Sunnis, Shi&#x27;as and Kharijites. Each sect developed distinct jurisprudence schools (&quot;madhhab&quot;) reflecting different methodologies of jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;).

The major Sunni madhhabs are Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i, and Hanbali.

The major Shi&#x27;a branches are Twelver (Imami), Ismaili (Sevener) and Zaidi (Fiver). Isma&#x27;ilism later split into Nizari Ismaili and Musta’li Ismaili, and then Mustaali was divided into Hafizi and Taiyabi Ismailis. It also gave rise to the Qarmatian movement and the Druze faith, although Druzes do not identify as Muslims. Twelver Shiism developed Ja&#x27;fari jurisprudence whose branches are Akhbarism and Usulism, and other movements such as Alawites, Shaykism and Alevism.

Similarly, Kharijites were initially divided into five major branches: Sufris, Azariqa, Najdat, Adjarites and Ibadis.

Among these numerous branches, only Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i, Hanbali, Imamiyyah-Ja&#x27;fari-Usuli, Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī, Alevi, Zaydi, Ibadi, Zahiri, Alawite, Druze and Taiyabi communities have survived. In addition, new schools of thought and movements like Quranist Muslims and Ahmadi Muslims later emerged independently.

==== Other religions ====
There are sizeable non-Muslim minorities in many Muslim-majority countries, includes, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Baháʼís, Druzes, Yazidis, Mandaeans, Yarsanis and Zoroastrians.

The Muslim world is home to some of the world&#x27;s most ancient Christian communities, and some of the most important cities of the Christian world—including three of its five great patriarchates (Alexandria, Antioch, and Constantinople). Scholars and intellectuals agree Christians have made significant contributions to Arab and Islamic civilization since the introduction of Islam, and they have had a significant impact contributing the culture of the Middle East and North Africa and other areas. Pew Research Center estimates indicate that in 2010, more than 64 million Christians lived in countries with Muslim majorities (excluding Nigeria). The Pew Forum study finds that Indonesia (21.1 million) has the largest Christian population in the Muslim world, followed by Egypt, Chad and Kazakhstan. While according to Adly A. Youssef and Martyn Thomas, in 2004, there were around 30 million Christians who lived in countries with Muslim majorities, with the largest Christian population number lived in Indonesia, followed by Egypt. Nigeria is divided almost evenly between Muslims and Christians, with more than 80 million Christians and Muslims.

In 2018, the Jewish Agency estimated that around 27,000 Jews live in Arab and Muslim countries. Jewish communities have existed across the Middle East and North Africa since the rise of Islam. Today, Jews residing in Muslim countries have been reduced to a small fraction of their former sizes, with the largest communities of Jews in Muslim countries exist in the non-Arab countries of Iran (9,500) and Turkey (14,500); both, however, are much smaller than they historically have been. Among Arab countries, the largest Jewish community now exists in Morocco with about 2,000 Jews and in Tunisia with about 1,000. The number of Druze worldwide is between 800,000 and one million, with the vast majority residing in the Levant (primarily in Syria and Lebanon).

In 2010, the Pew Forum study finds that Bangladesh (13.5 million), Indonesia (4 million), Pakistan (3.3 million) and Malaysia (1.7 million) has a sizeable Hindu minorities. Malaysia (5 million) has the largest Buddhist population in the Muslim world. Zoroastrians are the oldest remaining religious community in Iran. 

===Literacy and education===
The literacy rate in the Muslim world varies. Azerbaijan is in second place in the Index of Literacy of World Countries. Some members such as Iran, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan have over 97% literacy rates, whereas literacy rates are the lowest in Mali, Afghanistan, Chad and other parts of Africa. Several Muslim-majority countries, such as Turkey, Iran and Egypt have a high rate of citable scientific publications.

In 2015, the International Islamic News Agency reported that nearly 37% of the population of the Muslim world is unable to read or write, basing that figure on reports from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. In Egypt, the largest Muslim-majority Arab country, the youth female literacy rate exceeds that for males. Lower literacy rates are more prevalent in South Asian countries such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but are rapidly increasing. In the Eastern Middle East, Iran has a high level of youth literacy at 98%, but Iraq&#x27;s youth literacy rate has sharply declined from 85% to 57% during the American-led war and subsequent occupation. Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country in the world, has a 99% youth literacy rate.

A 2011 Pew Research Center showed that at the time about 36% of all Muslims had no formal schooling, with only 8% having graduate and post-graduate degrees.
The highest of years of schooling among Muslim-majority countries found in Uzbekistan (11.5), Kuwait (11.0) and Kazakhstan (10.7). In addition, the average of years of schooling in countries in which Muslims are the majority is 6.0 years of schooling, which lag behind the global average (7.7 years of schooling). In the youngest age (25–34) group surveyed, Young Muslims have the lowest average levels of education of any major religious group, with an average of 6.7 years of schooling, which lag behind the global average (8.6 years of schooling). The study found that Muslims have a significant amount of gender inequality in educational attainment, since Muslim women have an average of 4.9 years of schooling, compared to an average of 6.4 years of schooling among Muslim men.

===Refugees===
According to the UNHCR, Muslim-majority countries hosted 18 million refugees by the end of 2010.

Since then Muslim-majority countries have absorbed refugees from recent conflicts, including the uprising in Syria. In July 2013, the UN stated that the number of Syrian refugees had exceeded 1.8 million.
In Asia, an estimated 625,000 refugees from Rakhine, Myanmar, mostly Muslim, had crossed the border into Bangladesh since August 2017.

==Culture==
Throughout history, Muslim cultures have been diverse ethnically, linguistically and regionally. According to M. M. Knight, this diversity includes diversity in beliefs, interpretations and practices and communities and interests. Knight says perception of Muslim world among non-Muslims is usually supported through introductory literature about Islam, mostly present a version as per scriptural view which would include some prescriptive literature and abstracts of history as per authors own point of views, to which even many Muslims might agree, but that necessarily would not reflect Islam as lived on the ground, &#x27;in the experience of real human bodies&#x27;.

===Classical culture===


The term &quot;Islamic Golden Age&quot; has been attributed to a period in history during which science, economic development and cultural works in most of the Muslim-dominated world flourished. The age is traditionally understood to have begun during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid (786–809) with the inauguration of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, where scholars from various parts of the world sought to translate and gather all the known world&#x27;s knowledge into Arabic, and to have ended with the collapse of the Abbasid caliphate due to Mongol invasions and the Siege of Baghdad in 1258. The Abbasids were influenced by the Quranic injunctions and hadiths, such as &quot;the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr,&quot; that stressed the value of knowledge. The major Islamic capital cities of Baghdad, Cairo, and Córdoba became the main intellectual centers for science, philosophy, medicine, and education. During this period, the Muslim world was a collection of cultures; they drew together and advanced the knowledge gained from the ancient Greek, Roman, Persian, Chinese, Vedic, Egyptian, and Phoenician civilizations.

====Ceramics====

Between the 8th and 18th centuries, the use of ceramic glaze was prevalent in Islamic art, usually assuming the form of elaborate pottery. Tin-opacified glazing was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating to around the 8th century. Another contribution was the development of fritware, originating from 9th-century Iraq. Other centers for innovative ceramic pottery in the Old world included Fustat (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and Tabriz (from 1470 to 1550).

====Literature====

The best known work of fiction from the Islamic world is &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, a compilation of folk tales from Sanskrit, Persian, and later Arabian fables. The concept had been influenced by a pre-Islamic Persian prototype Hezār Afsān (Thousand Fables) that relied on particular Indian elements. It reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another. This work has been very influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by Antoine Galland. Imitations were written, especially in France. Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad the Sailor and Ali Baba.

An example of Arabic poetry and Persian poetry on romance is &quot;Layla and Majnun&quot;, dating back to the Umayyad era in the 7th century. It is a tragic story of undying love. Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, the national epic of Greater Iran, is a mythical and heroic retelling of Persian history. &quot;Amir Arsalan&quot; was also a popular mythical Persian story.

Ibn Tufayl (Abubacer) and Ibn al-Nafis were pioneers of the philosophical novel. Ibn Tufail wrote the first Arabic novel &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot; (&quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;) as a response to Al-Ghazali&#x27;s &quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;, and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a novel &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot; as a response to Ibn Tufail&#x27;s &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;. Both of these narratives had protagonists (Hayy in &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; and Kamil in &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot;) who were autodidactic feral children living in seclusion on a desert island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story in &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;, the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot;, developing into the earliest known coming of age plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel.

&quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot;, written by the Arabian polymath Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288), deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation, futurology, the end of the world and doomsday, resurrection, and the afterlife. Rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using the scientific knowledge of biology, astronomy, cosmology and geology known in his time. Ibn al-Nafis&#x27; fiction explained Islamic religious teachings via science and Islamic philosophy. Translations of Ibn Tufail&#x27;s &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; appeared in Latin (1671), English (1708), German, and Dutch. These European-language translations may have later inspired Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and Robert Boyle&#x27;s &quot;The Aspiring Naturalist&quot;.

====Philosophy====


One of the common definitions for &quot;Islamic philosophy&quot; is &quot;the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture.&quot; Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims. The Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980–1037) had more than 450 books attributed to him. His writings were concerned with various subjects, most notably philosophy and medicine. His medical textbook &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; was used as the standard text in European universities for centuries. He also wrote &quot;The Book of Healing&quot;, an influential scientific and philosophical encyclopedia.

Another figure from the Islamic Golden Age, Avicenna, also founded his own Avicennism school of philosophy, which was influential in both Islamic and Christian lands.

Yet another influential philosopher who had an influence on modern philosophy was Ibn Tufail. His philosophical novel, &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot;, translated into Latin as &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; in 1671, developed the themes of empiricism, tabula rasa, nature versus nurture, condition of possibility, materialism, and Molyneux&#x27;s problem. European scholars and writers influenced by this novel include John Locke, Gottfried Leibniz, Melchisédech Thévenot, John Wallis, Christiaan Huygens, George Keith, Robert Barclay, the Quakers, and Samuel Hartlib.

Islamic philosophers continued making advances in philosophy through to the 17th century, when Mulla Sadra founded his school of Transcendent theosophy and developed the concept of existentialism.

Other influential Muslim philosophers include Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), a pioneer of phenomenology and the philosophy of science and a critic of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Aristotle&#x27;s concept of place (topos); Al-Biruni, a critic of Aristotelian natural philosophy; Ibn Tufail and Ibn al-Nafis, pioneers of the philosophical novel; Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi, founder of Illuminationist philosophy; Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, a critic of Aristotelian logic and a pioneer of inductive logic; and Ibn Khaldun, a pioneer in the philosophy of history.

====Sciences====


Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of optics, especially for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light. Jim Al-Khalili stated in 2009 that Ibn al-Haytham is &#x27;often referred to as the &quot;world&#x27;s first true scientist&quot;.&#x27; al-Khwarzimi&#x27;s invented the log base systems that are being used today, he also contributed theorems in trigonometry as well as limits. Recent studies show that it is very likely that the Medieval Muslim artists were aware of advanced decagonal quasicrystal geometry (discovered half a millennium later in the 1970s and 1980s in the West) and used it in intricate decorative tilework in the architecture.

Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine, including the subjects of anatomy and physiology: such as in the 15th-century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled &quot;Tashrih al-badan&quot; (&quot;Anatomy of the body&quot;) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body&#x27;s structural, nervous and circulatory systems; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis, who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation. Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (also known as &quot;Abulcasis&quot;) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his &quot;Kitab al-Tasrif&quot; (&quot;Book of Concessions&quot;), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries. Other medical advancements came in the fields of pharmacology and pharmacy.

Some most famous scientists from the medieval Islamic world include Jābir ibn Hayyān, al-Farabi, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, Ibn al-Haytham, Al-Biruni, Avicenna, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and Ibn Khaldun.

====Technology====


In technology, the Muslim world adopted papermaking from China. The knowledge of gunpowder was also transmitted from China via predominantly Islamic countries, where formulas for pure potassium nitrate were developed.

Advances were made in irrigation and farming, using new technology such as the windmill. Crops such as almonds and citrus fruit were brought to Europe through al-Andalus, and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted by the Europeans. Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. Hormuz was an important center for this trade. There was also a dense network of trade routes in the Mediterranean, along which Muslim-majority countries traded with each other and with European powers such as Venice, Genoa and Catalonia (see also: Indo-Mediterranean). The Silk Road crossing Central Asia passed through Islamic states between China and Europe. The emergence of major economic empires with technological resources after the conquests of Timur (Tamerlane) and the resurgence of the Timurid Renaissance include the Mali Empire and the Bengal Sultanate in particular, a major global trading nation in the world, described by the Europeans to be the &quot;richest country to trade with&quot;.

Muslim engineers in the Islamic world made a number of innovative industrial uses of hydropower, and early industrial uses of tidal power and wind power. The industrial uses of watermills in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. A variety of industrial mills were being employed in the Islamic world, including early fulling mills, gristmills, paper mills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, tide mills and windmills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim engineers also invented crankshafts and water turbines, employed gears in mills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. Such advances made it possible for industrial tasks that were previously driven by manual labour in ancient times to be mechanized and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. The transfer of these technologies to medieval Europe had an influence on the Industrial Revolution, particularly from the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal and Tipu Sultan&#x27;s Kingdom, through the conquests of the East India Company.

===Arts===
The term &quot;Islamic art and architecture&quot; denotes the works of art and architecture produced from the 7th century onwards by people who lived within the territory that was inhabited by culturally Islamic populations.

====Architecture====


====Aniconism====

No Islamic visual images or depictions of God are meant to exist because it is believed that such artistic depictions may lead to idolatry. Muslims describe God by the names and attributes that, according to Islam, he revealed to his creation. All but one sura of the Quran begins with the phrase &quot;In the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful&quot;. Images of Mohammed are likewise prohibited. Such aniconism and iconoclasm can also be found in Jewish and some Christian theology.

====Arabesque====

Islamic art frequently adopts the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in a repetition known as arabesque. Such designs are highly nonrepresentational, as Islam forbids representational depictions as found in pre-Islamic pagan religions. Despite this, there is a presence of depictional art in some Muslim societies, notably the miniature style made famous in Persia and under the Ottoman Empire which featured paintings of people and animals, and also depictions of Quranic stories and Islamic traditional narratives. Another reason why Islamic art is usually abstract is to symbolize the transcendence, indivisible and infinite nature of God, an objective achieved by arabesque. Islamic calligraphy is an omnipresent decoration in Islamic art, and is usually expressed in the form of Quranic verses. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic &quot;kufic&quot; and &quot;naskh&quot; scripts, which can be found adorning the walls and domes of mosques, the sides of minbars, and so on.

Distinguishing motifs of Islamic architecture have always been ordered repetition, radiating structures, and rhythmic, metric patterns. In this respect, fractal geometry has been a key utility, especially for mosques and palaces. Other features employed as motifs include columns, piers and arches, organized and interwoven with alternating sequences of niches and colonnettes. The role of domes in Islamic architecture has been considerable. Its usage spans centuries, first appearing in 691 with the construction of the Dome of the Rock mosque, and recurring even up until the 17th century with the Taj Mahal. And as late as the 19th century, Islamic domes had been incorporated into European architecture.

===Calendar===
Two calendars are used all over the Muslim world. One is a lunar calendar that is most widely used among Muslims. The other one is a solar calendar officially used in Iran and Afghanistan.

== Women ==

According to &quot;Riada Asimovic Akyol,&quot; while Muslim women&#x27;s experiences differ a lot by location and personal situations such as family upbringing, class and education; the difference between culture and religions is often ignored by community and state leaders in many of the Muslim majority countries. The key issue in the Muslim world regarding gender issues is that religious texts constructed in highly patriarchal environments and based on biological essentialism are still valued highly in Islam, hence views emphasizing on men&#x27;s superiority in unequal gender roles are widespread among many conservative Muslims (men and women). Orthodox Muslims often believe that rights and responsibilities of women in Islam are different from that of men and sacrosanct since assigned by the God. According to Asma Barlas, patriarchal behaviour among Muslims is based in an ideology which jumbles sexual and biological differences with gender dualisms and inequality. Modernist discourse of liberal progressive movements like Islamic feminism have been revisiting hermeneutics of feminism in Islam in terms of respect for Muslim women&#x27;s lives and rights. &quot;Riada Asimovic Akyol&quot; further says that equality for Muslim women needs to be achieved through self-criticism.

<text>Eric Voegelin (born Erich Hermann Wilhelm Vögelin, ; January 3, 1901 – January 19, 1985) was a German-American political philosopher. He was born in Cologne, and educated in political science at the University of Vienna, where he became an associate professor of political science in the law faculty. In 1938, he and his wife fled from the Nazi forces which had entered Vienna. They emigrated to the United States, where they became citizens in 1944. He spent most of his academic career at Louisiana State University, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Hoover Institution of Stanford University.

==Early life==
Voegelin was born in Cologne on January 3, 1901. His parents moved to Vienna in 1910, and he eventually studied at the University of Vienna. The advisers on his dissertation were Hans Kelsen and Othmar Spann. After his habilitation there in 1928, he taught political theory and sociology. In Austria, Voegelin began lasting friendships with Alfred Schütz and with Friedrich Hayek.

==Career==
As a result of the Anschluss in 1938, Voegelin was fired from his job. Narrowly avoiding arrest by the Gestapo and after a brief stay in Switzerland, he arrived in the United States. He taught at various universities before he joined Louisiana State University&#x27;s Department of Government in 1942. Voegelin remained in Baton Rouge until 1958, when he accepted an offer by Munich&#x27;s Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich to fill Max Weber&#x27;s former chair in political science, which had been unoccupied since Weber&#x27;s death in 1920. In Munich, he founded the Institut für Politische Wissenschaft. Voegelin returned to the United States in 1969 to join Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace as Henry Salvatori Fellow. There he continued his work until his death. He was a member of the Philadelphia Society.

Although some have found his books obscure, according to his student Ellis Sandoz, he was a &quot;wonderfully lucid lecturer with the gift of explaining with complete intelligibility the most abstruse theories to the comprehension and fascination&quot; of his students.

==Work==
In his later life Voegelin worked to account for the endemic political violence of the twentieth century, in an effort variously referred to as a philosophy of politics, history, or consciousness. In Voegelin&#x27;s Weltanschauung, he &quot;blamed a flawed utopian interpretation of Christianity for spawning totalitarian movements like Nazism and Communism.&quot; Voegelin eschewed any ideological labels or categorizations that readers and followers attempted to impose on his work. Nevertheless, his work came to the forefront during the Cold War and was adopted mainly by conservatives.

Voegelin published scores of books, essays, and reviews in his lifetime. An early work was &quot;Die politischen Religionen&quot; (1938; &quot;The Political Religions&quot;), on totalitarian ideologies as political religions due to their structural similarities to religion. He wrote the multi-volume (English-language) &quot;Order and History&quot;, which began publication in 1956 and remained incomplete at the time of his death 29 years later. His 1951 Charles Walgreen lectures, published as &quot;The New Science of Politics&quot;, is sometimes seen as a prolegomenon to this series, and remains his best known work. He left many manuscripts unpublished, including a history of political ideas, which has since been published in eight volumes.

&quot;Order and History&quot; was originally conceived as a five-volume examination of the history of order occasioned by Voegelin&#x27;s personal experience of the disorder of his time. The first three volumes, &quot;Israel and Revelation&quot;, &quot;The World of the Polis&quot;, and &quot;Plato and Aristotle&quot;, appeared in rapid succession in 1956 and 1957 and focused on the evocations of order in the ancient Near East and Greece.

Voegelin then encountered difficulties which slowed down the publication. This, combined with his university administrative duties and work related to the new institute, meant that seventeen years separated the fourth from the third volume. His new concerns were indicated in the 1966 German collection Anamnesis: &quot;Zur Theorie der Geschichte und Politik&quot;. The fourth volume, &quot;The Ecumenic Age&quot;, appeared in 1974. It broke with the chronological pattern of the previous volumes by investigating symbolizations of order ranging in time from the Sumerian King List to Hegel. Work on the final volume, &quot;In Search of Order&quot;, occupied Voegelin&#x27;s final days and it was published posthumously in 1987.
One of Voegelin&#x27;s main points in his later work is that our experience of transcendence conveys a sense of order. Although transcendence can never be fully defined or described, it may be conveyed in symbols. A particular sense of transcendent order serves as a basis for a particular political order. A philosophy of consciousness can therefore become a philosophy of politics. Insights may become fossilised as dogma.

Voegelin is more interested in the ontological issues that arise from these experiences than the epistemological questions of how we know that a vision of order is true or not. For Voegelin, the essence of truth is trust. All philosophy begins with experience of the divine. Since God is experienced as good, one can be confident that reality is knowable. Given the possibility of knowledge, Voegelin holds there are two modes: intentionality and luminosity. Visions of order belong to the latter category. The truth of any vision is confirmed by its orthodoxy, by what Voegelin jokingly calls its lack of originality.

Voegelin&#x27;s work does not fit in any standard classifications, although some of his readers have found similarities in it to contemporaneous works by, for example, Hans Jonas, Ernst Cassirer, Martin Heidegger, and Hans-Georg Gadamer. Voegelin often invents terms or uses old ones in new ways. However, there are patterns in his work with which the reader can quickly become familiar.

According to Ellis Sandoz, Voegelin may well be America&#x27;s leading philosopher, and is rightly compared with the premier minds of our century and, perhaps, of the millennia. Thomas Altizer has said that &quot;Order and History&quot; &quot;may someday be perceived as the most important work of Old Testament scholarship ever written in the United States,&quot; adding that it is noteworthy that it was written by a political scientist and philosopher.

Among indications of growing engagement with Voegelin&#x27;s work are the 305 page international bibliography published in 2000 by Munich&#x27;s Wilhelm Fink Verlag; the presence of dedicated research centers at universities in the United States, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom; the appearance of recent translations in languages ranging from Portuguese to Japanese; and the publishing of a 34 volume collection of his primary works by the University of Missouri Press and various primary and secondary works offered by the &quot;Eric-Voegelin-Archiv&quot; of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität.

==On gnosticism==

In his &quot;The New Science of Politics&quot;, &quot;Order and History&quot;, and &quot;Science, Politics and Gnosticism&quot;, Voegelin opposed what he believed to be unsound Gnostic influences in politics. 

Eugene Webb stated that Voegelin understood &quot;gnosis&quot; as 

and &quot;gnosticism&quot; as
Accordingly, Voegelin distinguished between ancient and modern gnosticisms: whereas the former sought salvation in a realm transcending the actual world, the &quot;modern&quot; form aimed to change it immanently (see below). 
Apart from the Classical Christian writers against heresy, his sources on Gnosticism were secondary since the texts of the Nag Hammadi library were not yet widely available. For example, Voegelin used Hans Urs von Balthasar, Henri de Lubac, and Hans Jonas.

Voegelin perceived similarities between ancient Gnosticism and modernist political theories, particularly Communism and Nazism. He identified the root of the Gnostic impulse as alienation, that is, a sense of disconnection from society and a belief that this lack is the result of the inherent disorder, or even evil, of the world. That alienation has two effects:
* The first is the belief that the disorder of the world can be transcended by extraordinary insight, learning, or knowledge, called a &quot;Gnostic Speculation&quot; by Voegelin (he claimed that the Gnostics themselves referred to that as &quot;gnosis&quot;).
* The second is the desire to implement and or create a policy to actualize the speculation, or &quot;Immanentize the eschaton&quot;: to create a sort of heaven on earth within history.

According to Voegelin, the Gnostics really reject the Christian eschaton of the kingdom of God and replace it with a human form of salvation through esoteric ritual or practice.

The primary feature that characterizes a tendency as gnostic for Voegelin is that it is motivated by the notion that the world and humanity can be fundamentally transformed and perfected through the intervention of a chosen group of people (an elite), a man-god, or men-Gods. The &quot;Übermensch&quot; is the chosen one who has a kind of special knowledge (like magic or science) about how to perfect human existence.

That stands in contrast to a notion of redemption that is achieved through the reconciliation of mankind with the divine. Marxism, therefore, qualifies as &quot;gnostic&quot; because it purports that the perfect society on earth can be established once capitalism has been overthrown by the proletariat. Likewise, Nazism is seen as &quot;gnostic&quot; because it posits that utopia can be achieved by attaining racial purity once the master race has freed itself of the racially inferior and the degenerate.

In both cases specifically analyzed by Voegelin, the totalitarian impulse is derived from the alienation of the individuals from the rest of society. That leads to a desire to dominate (&quot;libido dominandi&quot;), which has its roots in the Gnostic&#x27;s conviction of the imperative of his vision but also in his lack of concord with a large body of his society. As a result, there is very little regard for the welfare of those who are harmed by the resulting politics, which ranges from coercive to calamitous (such as the English proverb: &quot;You have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet&quot; or its Russian variety: &quot;When you chop wood, chips fly&quot;).

===Immanentizing the eschaton===

One of his most quoted passages (by such figures as William F. Buckley Jr.) is:

From this comes the catchphrase: &quot;Don&#x27;t immanentize the eschaton!&quot;, which simply means: &quot;Do not try to make that which belongs to the afterlife happen here and now&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t try to create Heaven on Earth.&quot;

When Voegelin uses the term &quot;gnosis&quot; negatively, it is to reflect the word as found in the Manichaeism and Valentinianism of antiquity. As it is later then immanentized (or manifest) in modernity in the wake of Joachim of Fiore and in the various ideological movements outlined in his works. Voegelin also builds on the term &quot;Gnosticism&quot; as it is defined by Hans Jonas in his &quot;The Gnostic Religion&quot;, in reference to Heidegger&#x27;s Gnosticism, which is to have an understanding and control over reality that makes mankind as powerful as the role of God in reality.

Voegelin was arguing from a Hellenistic position that good &quot;gnosis&quot; is derived from &quot;pistis&quot; (faith) and that the pagan tradition made a false distinction between faith and &quot;&quot;. Furthermore, the dualist perspective was the very essence of gnosticism via the misuse of &quot;noema&quot; and caused a destructive division between the internal and external world in human consciousness. To reconcile the internal (subjective) and external (objective) world of consciousness was the restoration of order.

=== Critique of rationalism and phenomenology ===
===Spiritual revival===
Voegelin&#x27;s work does not lay out a program of reform or offer a doctrine of recovery from what he termed the &quot;demono-maniacal&quot; in modern politics. However, interspersed in his writings is the idea of a spiritual recovery of the primary experiences of divine order. He was not interested so much in what religious dogmas might result in personal salvation but rather a recovery of the human in the classical sense of the &quot;daimonios aner&quot; (Plato&#x27;s term for &quot;the spiritual man&quot;). He did not speculate on the institutional forms in which a spiritual recovery might take place but expressed confidence that the current 500-year cycle of secularism would come to an end because he stated that &quot;you cannot deny the human forever.&quot;

In an essay published in 1965, Voegelin suggested that the Soviet Union would collapse from within because of its historical roots in philosophy and Christianity. Later, at an informal talk given at University College, Dublin, Ireland in 1972, Voegelin suggested the Soviet Union might collapse by 1980 because of its failure to succeed in its domestic commitments and external political challenges.

== Reception ==
Eugene Webb criticized Voegelin&#x27;s conception of &quot;gnosis&quot; and his analysis of Gnosticism in general. In the article &quot;Voegelin&#x27;s Gnosticism Reconsidered,&quot; Webb explained that Voegelin&#x27;s concept of Gnosticism was conceived &quot;not primarily to describe ancient phenomena but to help us understand some modern ones for which the evidence is a great deal clearer.&quot; Webb continues, &quot;the category (of Gnosticism) is of limited usefulness for the purpose to which he put it… and the fact that the idea of Gnosticism as such has become so problematic and complex in recent years must at the very least undercut Voegelin&#x27;s effort to trace a historical line of descent from ancient sources to the modern phenomena he tried to use them to illuminate.&quot;

Because Voegelin applied the concept of gnosis to a wide array of ideologies and movements such as Marxism, communism, National Socialism, progressivism, liberalism, and humanism, critics have proposed that Voegelin&#x27;s concept of Gnosis lacks theoretical precision. Therefore, Voegelin&#x27;s &quot;gnosis&quot; can, according to the critics, hardly serve as a scientific basis for an analysis of political movements. Rather, they claim, the term &quot;Gnosticism&quot; as used by Voegelin is more of an invective just as &quot;when on the lowest level of propaganda those who do not conform with one&#x27;s own opinion are smeared as communists.&quot;

<text>Stanley (also known as Port Stanley) is the capital city of the Falkland Islands. It is located on the island of East Falkland, on a north-facing slope in one of the wettest parts of the islands. At the 2016 census, the city had a population of 2,460. The entire population of the Falkland Islands was 3,398 on Census Day – 9 October 2016.

Stanley is represented by five of the eight elected members of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands: Stacy Bragger, Barry Elsby, Mark Pollard, Roger Spink, and Leona Vidal Roberts. An elected Town Council of Stanley existed from 1948 to 1973.

On 14 June 2022, Stanley received letters patent, formally awarding it city status.

==Facilities and infrastructure==
Stanley is the main shopping centre on the islands and the hub of East Falkland&#x27;s road network. Attractions include the Falkland Islands Museum, Government House—built in 1845 and home to the Governor of the Falkland Islands—and a golf course, as well as a whale-bone arch, a totem pole, several war memorials and the shipwrecks in its harbour. The Falkland Islands Company owns several shops. Stanley has four pubs, 11 hotels and guesthouses, three restaurants, a fish and chip shop and the main tourist office. There are three churches, including the Anglican Christ Church Cathedral, the southernmost Anglican cathedral in the world, and the Roman Catholic St. Mary&#x27;s Church. A bomb disposal unit in the town is a legacy of the Falklands War.

The town hall serves as a post office, philatelic bureau, law court and dance hall. The police station also contains the islands&#x27; only prison, with capacity for 13 inmates.
The community centre includes a swimming pool (the only public one in the islands), a sports centre, and school. A grass football pitch is located by the community centre. A separate building houses the college of further education and the library. A new sports centre is under construction to the south of the town centre, next to a newly-laid floodlit all-weather pitch.

Stanley Racecourse, located on the west side of Stanley, holds a two-day horse racing meeting every year on 26 and 27 December. The Christmas races have been held here for over 100 years.

Stanley Golf Course has an 18-hole course and a club house. It is also located to the west of Stanley.

King Edward VII Memorial Hospital is the islands&#x27; main hospital, with doctors&#x27; practice and surgery, radiology department, dental surgery and emergency facilities.

The Port Stanley Airport operates internal flights, and scheduled international passenger flights operate from the RAF Mount Pleasant military airbase.

Stanley is also home to the Falkland Islands Radio Station (FIRS), the Stanley office of the British Antarctic Survey, and the office of the weekly &quot;Penguin News&quot; newspaper.

==History==

The original capital of the islands was at Port Louis to the north of the present site of Stanley, on Berkeley Sound. Captains Francis Crozier and James Clark Ross were recruited by Governor Richard Moody in his quest to find a new capital for The Falklands. Both Crozier and Ross (who are remembered in Crozier Place and Ross Road in Stanley) were among the Royal Navy&#x27;s most distinguished seafarers. They spent five months in the islands with their ships &quot;Terror&quot; and &quot;Erebus&quot;, later lost looking for the Northwest Passage. Governor Moody (after whom Moody Brook is named), however, decided to move the capital to Port Jackson, which was renamed &quot;Stanley Harbour&quot;, after a survey. Stanley Harbour was considered to have a deeper anchorage for visiting ships. Not all the inhabitants were happy with the change; a JW Whitington is recorded as saying, &quot;Of all the miserable bog holes, I believe that Mr Moody has selected one of the worst for the site of his town.&quot;
Work on the settlement began in 1843 and it became the capital in July 1845. It was named after Lord Stanley, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies at the time. In 1849, 30 married Chelsea Pensioners were settled there to help with the defence of the islands and to develop the new settlement.

The settlement soon grew as a deep-water port, specialising at first in ship repairs; before the construction of the Panama Canal, Port Stanley was a major repair stop for ships travelling through the Straits of Magellan. The rough waters and intense storms found at the tip of the continent forced many ships to Stanley Harbour, and the ship repair industry helped to drive the island economy. Later it became a base for whaling and sealing in the South Atlantic and Antarctic.

Later still it was an important coaling station for the Royal Navy. This led to ships based here being involved in the Battle of the Falkland Islands in the First World War, and the Battle of the River Plate in the Second World War.

Landslides caused by excessive peat cutting destroyed part of the town in 1879 and again in 1886, which killed two people. At about midnight on 29 November 1878 a black moving mass, several feet high, was moving forwards at a rate of or . The next morning the town was cut in two; the only way to travel between the two parts was by boat.

During the Second World War, a hulk in Stanley Harbour was used for interning the British Fascist and Mosleyite Jeffrey Hamm. A minor figure in the British Union of Fascists (BUF) at the time, Hamm moved to the Falkland Islands in 1939 to work as a teacher. He was arrested there (under Defence Regulation 18B) in 1940 for encouraging fascist views among his pupils and his BUF membership and later transferred to a prison camp in South Africa.
Stanley Airport is used by internal flights and provides connections to British bases in Antarctica. Flights to Argentina ended after the 1982 conflict. A weekly flight to Punta Arenas in Chile commenced in 1993, which now operates out of RAF Mount Pleasant. Scheduled passenger flights between the Mount Pleasant airfield and the UK are also operated twice a week by a civilian airline contractor on behalf of the Royal Air Force.

Stanley was occupied by Argentine troops for about 10 weeks during the Falklands War in 1982. The Argentinians renamed the town Puerto Argentino, and although Spanish names for places in the Falklands were historically accepted as alternatives, this one is considered to be extremely offensive by many islanders. Stanley suffered considerable damage during the war, from both the Argentine occupation and the British naval shelling of the town, which killed three civilians. After the British secured the high ground around the town the Argentines surrendered with no fighting in the town itself. The beaches and land around it were heavily mined and some areas remain marked minefields.

Since the Falklands War, Stanley has benefited from the growth of the fishing and tourism industries in the Islands. Stanley itself has developed greatly in that time, with the building of a large amount of residential housing, particularly to the east of the town centre. Stanley is now more than a third bigger than it was in 1982.

In 2022, as part of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours, Stanley was one of the successful bids for city status, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the invasion and liberation of the port. On 14 June 2022, Stanley received letters patent from the monarch awarding city status. The Governor of the Falkland Islands, Nigel Phillips, read out the document outside the town hall on the same day.

==Etymology==
A number of variants of the city&#x27;s name have appeared in both English and Spanish. Stanley Harbour was originally known as &quot;Port Jackson&quot;, and this name would have applied to the area before the town was built. Although the town is officially known as &quot;Stanley&quot;, it is frequently referred to as &quot;Port Stanley&quot;, especially in British reports about the Falklands War. This is in line with various other settlements around the islands, e.g. Port Howard and Port Stephens. However, &quot;Stanley&quot; without the &quot;Port&quot; prefix was established long before the war, and on 2 August 1956, the Officer Administering the Government of the Falkland Islands reported to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London as follows:

===Spanish and Argentine names===
The situation with the Spanish version of the name is far more complicated. Stanley, unlike Port Louis, the former capital of the islands, was a new settlement founded by the British, and therefore did not have a Spanish name of its own. Many Spanish speakers use &quot;Puerto Stanley&quot;, as a neutral translation of the British name but it is disliked by supporters of Argentine sovereignty who refuse to recognise English language names. Supporters of the Argentine claim have used several different names, none of which are accepted by the islanders themselves:

* Puerto Soledad (the port of East Falkland, known in Spanish as &quot;Isla Soledad&quot;) – reported in 1965, but in fact the old Spanish name of Port Louis, the old capital, not Stanley.
* Puerto Rivero – a reference to Antonio Rivero, a controversial Argentine figure in the early history of the islands. Used by peronists and the hijackers of Aerolineas Argentinas Flight 648 who landed at Stanley in September 1966. It was also used on 3–4 April 1982 after the Argentine invasion.
* Puerto de la Isla Soledad – a variant on Puerto Soledad. Used 5 April 1982.
* Puerto de las Islas Malvinas (Port of the Malvinas/Falklands), used from 6–20 April 1982.
* Puerto Argentino (Port Argentine) – used ever since 21 April 1982 by the Argentines, although in 1994 the Argentine Government signed an undertaking to review toponymy relating to the Argentine occupation of the islands.

During the 1982 occupation, Patrick Watts of the islands&#x27; radio station used circumlocutions to avoid using Argentine names:

==Climate==
The climate of Stanley is classified as a subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfc&quot;), bordering very closely on a polar climate (&quot;ET&quot;). Nowadays it barely avoids classification as &quot;ET&quot; because the mean temperature is greater than for two months of the year. Unlike typical tundra climates, however, the winters are very mild, and vegetation grows there that normally could not in a climate this close to a polar climate. Contrast this with Churchill, Manitoba, which also has a near-tundra climate but is much more continental in nature.

The Falkland Islands have displayed a warming trend in recent years; the mean daily January maximum for Mount Pleasant for the years 1999-2012 is compared to Stanley&#x27;s 1961-90 average of . Formerly, Stanley had a tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;), due to cool summer temperatures (the mean temperature was less than in the hottest month).

Like the rest of the archipelago, Stanley has more or less even temperatures through the year and strong westerlies. Precipitation, averaging a year, is nonetheless relatively low, and evenly spread throughout the year. Typically, at least of rain will be recorded on 125.2 days of the year. The islands receive 36.3% of possible sunshine, or around 1500–1600 hours a year, a level similar to southern parts of England. Daytime temperatures are similar to the Northern Isles of Scotland, though nights tend to be somewhat colder, with frost occurring on more than 1 in 3 nights (128.4 nights). Snow occurs in the winter. Light snowfall can occur at any time of year.

Stanley is a similar distance from the equator to British warm-summer climates like London, Cardiff and Bristol, illustrating the relative chilliness of the climate. In the northern hemisphere, lowland tundra areas are located at latitudes further from the tropics. Many European capitals are also located much farther from the tropics than Stanley is. The nearest larger city of Río Gallegos (the provincial capital of Santa Cruz) in Argentina has a slightly milder climate (annual mean temperature being higher) due to its position on the South American mainland, although summers everywhere on this latitude in the southern hemisphere are very cool due to important marine effects.

Temperature extremes at Stanley vary from to . More recently, on 23 January 1992, nearby Mount Pleasant Airport recorded .

==Education==

The Stanley Infant &amp; Junior School (IJS) is located along John Street at the intersection with Villiers Street in Stanley. The school first opened in 1955 and has about 250 students between the ages of four and 11.

The Falkland Island Community School (FICS) is located on Reservoir Road in Stanley. It has approximately 220 students between 11 and 16.

==Economy==

Today, roughly one third of the city’s residents are employed by the government, and tourism is also a major source of employment. On days when two or more large cruise ships dock in the town, tourists frequently outnumber the local residents.

Peat was once a prominent heating/fuel source in Stanley, and stacks of drying peat under cover can still be seen by the occasional house.

==Nearby points of interest==
Gypsy Cove, known for its Magellanic penguins, and Cape Pembroke, the easternmost point of the Falklands, lie nearby. Gypsy Cove is four miles (6 km) from Stanley and can be reached by taxi or on foot.

<text>James Cooke Brown (July 21, 1921 – February 13, 2000) was an American sociologist and science fiction author. He is notable for creating the constructed language Loglan and for designing the Parker Brothers board game &quot;Careers&quot;.

Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;The Troika Incident&quot; (Doubleday, 1970) describes a worldwide free knowledge base similar to the Internet. The novel begins with the belief that the world is on the eve of self-destruction, but then it presents a world about a century from now which is a paradise of peace and prosperity, all based on ideas, movements, and knowledge presently available in the world. In its metafictional structure, the novel is a call for social change, not through revolution but through free education and the resilience of human ingenuity. Long out of print and relatively rare, an e-book version (Amazon Kindle) of the novel was released in 2012. The novel envisioned all books and periodicals being viewed on portable electronic devices called &quot;readers&quot; in the year 2070, when it is set.

Among his other achievements, Brown designed, and had built, a three-hulled sailboat, called a trimaran. He utilized this boat to sail to many parts of the world.

While on a South American cruise with his wife, Brown was admitted to a hospital in Argentina, where he died at the age of 78.

<text>A vocabulary (also known as a lexicon) is a set of words, typically the set in a language or the set known to an individual. The word &quot;vocabulary&quot; originated from the Latin , meaning &quot;a word, name&quot;. It forms an essential component of language and communication, helping convey thoughts, ideas, emotions, and information. Vocabulary can be oral, written, or signed and can be categorized into two main types: active vocabulary (words one uses regularly) and passive vocabulary (words one recognizes but does not use often). An individual&#x27;s vocabulary continually evolves through various methods, including direct instruction, independent reading, and natural language exposure, but it can also shrink due to forgetting, trauma, or disease. Furthermore, vocabulary is a significant focus of study across various disciplines, like linguistics, education, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Vocabulary is not limited to single words; it also encompasses multi-word units known as collocations, idioms, and other types of phraseology. Acquiring an adequate vocabulary is one of the largest challenges in learning a second language.

== Terminology ==
A vocabulary is the set of words in a given language that an individual knows and uses. In the context of linguistics, a vocabulary may refer more broadly to any set of words. Types of vocabularies have been further defined: a &quot;lexis&quot; is a vocabulary comprising all words used in a language or other linguistic context or in a person&#x27;s lexical repertoire. An individual person&#x27;s vocabulary includes a &quot;passive vocabulary&quot; of words they can recognize or understand, as well as an &quot;active vocabulary&quot; of words they regularly use in speech and writing. 
In semiotics, vocabulary refers to the complete set of symbols and signs in a sign system or a text, extending the definition beyond purely verbal communication to encompass other forms of symbolic communication.

Vocabulary acquisition is a central aspect of language education, as it directly impacts reading comprehension, expressive and receptive language skills, and academic achievement. Vocabulary is examined in psychology as a measure of language processing and cognitive development. It can serve as an indicator of intellectual ability or cognitive status, with vocabulary tests often forming part of intelligence and neuropsychological assessments.

=== Definition of &quot;word&quot; ===

&quot;Word&quot; has a variety of meanings, and our understand of ideas such as vocabulary size differ depending on the definition used. 

The most common definition equates words with lemmas (the inflected or dictionary form; this includes &quot;walk&quot;, but not &quot;walks, walked or walking&quot;). Most of the time lemmas do not include proper nouns (names of people, places, companies, etc.). Another definition often used in research of vocabulary size is that of word family. These are all the words that can be derived from a ground word (e.g., the words &quot;effortless, effortlessly, effortful, effortfully&quot; are all part of the word family &quot;effort&quot;). Estimates of vocabulary size range from as high as 200 thousand to as low as 10 thousand, depending on the definition used.

== Vocabulary in an individual ==

=== Productive and receptive knowledge ===
The first major change distinction that must be made when evaluating word knowledge is whether the knowledge is productive (also called achieve or active) or receptive (also called receive or passive); even within those opposing categories, there is often no clear distinction. Words that are generally understood when heard or read or seen constitute a person&#x27;s receptive vocabulary. These words may range from well known to barely known (see degree of knowledge below). A person&#x27;s receptive vocabulary is usually the larger of the two. For example, although a young child may not yet be able to speak, write, or sign, they may be able to follow simple commands and appear to understand a good portion of the language to which they are exposed. In this case, the child&#x27;s receptive vocabulary is likely tens, if not hundreds of words, but their active vocabulary is zero. When that child learns to speak or sign, however, the child&#x27;s active vocabulary begins to increase. It is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary, for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure, and can produce them, but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation.

Productive vocabulary, therefore, generally refers to words that can be produced within an appropriate context and match the intended meaning of the speaker or signer. As with receptive vocabulary, however, there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an active vocabulary. Knowing how to pronounce, sign, or write a word does not necessarily mean that the word that has been used correctly or accurately reflects the intended message; but it does reflect a minimal amount of productive knowledge.

=== Degree of knowledge ===
Within the receptive–productive distinction lies a range of abilities that are often referred to as &quot;degree of knowledge&quot;. This simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person&#x27;s vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt. Roughly, these stages could be described as:

# Never encountered the word.
# Heard the word, but cannot define it.
# Recognizes the word due to context or tone of voice.
# Able to use the word and understand the general and/or intended meaning, but cannot clearly explain it.
# Fluent with the word – its use and definition.

=== Depth of knowledge ===
The differing degrees of word knowledge imply a greater &quot;depth of knowledge&quot;, but the process is more complex than that. There are many facets to knowing a word, some of which are not hierarchical so their acquisition does not necessarily follow a linear progression suggested by &quot;degree of knowledge&quot;. Several frameworks of word knowledge have been proposed to better operationalise this concept. One such framework includes nine facets:

# orthography – written form
# phonology – spoken form
# reference – concept and reference
# semantics – meaning
# register – appropriacy of use or register
# collocation – lexical neighbours
# word associations
# syntax – grammatical function
# morphology – word parts

=== Types of vocabulary ===
&quot;Listed in order of most ample to most limited:&quot;

==== Reading vocabulary ====
A person&#x27;s reading vocabulary is all the words recognized when reading. This class of vocabulary is generally the most ample, as new words are more commonly encountered when reading than when listening.

==== Listening vocabulary ====
A person&#x27;s listening vocabulary comprises the words recognized when listening to speech. Cues such as the speaker&#x27;s tone and gestures, the topic of discussion, and the conversation&#x27;s social context may convey the meaning of an unfamiliar word.

==== Speaking vocabulary ====
A person&#x27;s speaking vocabulary comprises the words used in speech and is generally a subset of the listening vocabulary. Due to the spontaneous nature of speech, words are often misused slightly and unintentionally, but facial expressions and tone of voice can compensate for this misuse.

==== Writing vocabulary ====
The written word appears in registers as different as formal essays and social media feeds. While many written words rarely appear in speech, a person&#x27;s written vocabulary is generally limited by preference and context: a writer may prefer one synonym over another, and they will be unlikely to use technical vocabulary relating to a subject in which they have no interest or knowledge.

==== Final vocabulary ====
The American philosopher Richard Rorty characterized a person&#x27;s &quot;final vocabulary&quot; as follows:

All human beings carry about a set of words which they employ to justify their actions, their beliefs, and their lives. These are the words in which we formulate praise of our friends and contempt for our enemies, our long-term projects, our deepest self-doubts and our highest hopes... I shall call these words a person&#x27;s &quot;final vocabulary&quot;. Those words are as far as he can go with language; beyond them is only helpless passivity or a resort to force. (&quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot; p. 73)

=== Vocabulary growth ===

During its infancy, a child instinctively builds a vocabulary. Infants imitate words that they hear and then associate those words with objects and actions. This is the listening vocabulary. The speaking vocabulary follows, as a child&#x27;s thoughts become more reliant on their ability to self-express without relying on gestures or babbling. Once the reading and writing vocabularies start to develop, through questions and education, the child starts to discover the anomalies and irregularities of language.

In first grade, a child who can read learns about twice as many words as one who cannot. Generally, this gap does not narrow later. This results in a wide range of vocabulary by age five or six, when an English-speaking child will have learned about 1500 words.

Vocabulary grows throughout one&#x27;s life. Between the ages of 20 and 60, people learn about 6,000 more lemmas, or one every other day. An average 20-year-old knows 42,000 lemmas coming from 11,100 word families. People expand their vocabularies by e.g. reading, playing word games, and participating in vocabulary-related programs. Exposure to traditional print media teaches correct spelling and vocabulary, while exposure to text messaging leads to more relaxed word acceptability constraints.

=== Importance ===
* An extensive vocabulary aids expression and communication.
* Vocabulary size has been directly linked to reading comprehension.
* Linguistic vocabulary is synonymous with thinking vocabulary.
* A person may be judged by others based on their vocabulary.
* Wilkins (1972) said, &quot;Without grammar, very little can be conveyed; without vocabulary, nothing can be conveyed.&quot;

=== Vocabulary size ===

==== Native-language vocabulary ====
Estimating average vocabulary size poses various difficulties and limitations due to the different definitions and methods employed such as what is the word, what is to know a word, what sample dictionaries were used, how tests were conducted, and so on. Native speakers&#x27; vocabularies also vary widely within a language, and are dependent on the level of the speaker&#x27;s education.

As a result, estimates vary from 10,000 to 17,000 word families or 17,000-42,000 dictionary words for young adult native speakers of English.

A 2016 study shows that 20-year-old English native speakers recognize on average 42,000 lemmas, ranging from 27,100 for the lowest 5% of the population to 51,700 lemmas for the highest 5%. These lemmas come from 6,100 word families in the lowest 5% of the population and 14,900 word families in the highest 5%. 60-year-olds know on average 6,000 lemmas more.
According to another, earlier 1995 study junior-high students would be able to recognize the meanings of about 10,000–12,000 words, whereas for college students this number grows up to about 12,000–17,000 and for elderly adults up to about 17,000 or more.

For native speakers of German, average absolute vocabulary sizes range from 5,900 lemmas in first grade to 73,000 for adults.

==== Foreign-language vocabulary ====

===== The effects of vocabulary size on language comprehension =====
The knowledge of the 3000 most frequent English word families or the 5000 most frequent words provides 95% vocabulary coverage of spoken discourse.
For minimal reading comprehension a threshold of 3,000 word families (5,000 lexical items) was suggested and for reading for pleasure 5,000 word families (8,000 lexical items) are required. An &quot;optimal&quot; threshold of 8,000 word families yields the coverage of 98% (including proper nouns).

===== Second language vocabulary acquisition =====
Learning vocabulary is one of the first steps in learning a second language, but a learner never finishes vocabulary acquisition. Whether in one&#x27;s native language or a second language, the acquisition of new vocabulary is an ongoing process. There are many techniques that help one acquire new vocabulary.

===== Memorization =====
Although memorization can be seen as tedious or boring, associating one word in the native language with the corresponding word in the second language until memorized is considered one of the best methods of vocabulary acquisition. By the time students reach adulthood, they generally have gathered a number of personalized memorization methods. Although many argue that memorization does not typically require the complex cognitive processing that increases retention (Sagarra and Alba, 2006), it does typically require a large amount of repetition, and spaced repetition with flashcards is an established method for memorization, particularly used for vocabulary acquisition in computer-assisted language learning. Other methods typically require more time and longer to recall.

Some words cannot be easily linked through association or other methods. When a word in the second language is phonologically or visually similar to a word in the native language, one often assumes they also share similar meanings. Though this is frequently the case, it is not always true. When faced with a false friend, memorization and repetition are the keys to mastery. If a second language learner relies solely on word associations to learn new vocabulary, that person will have a very difficult time mastering false friends. When large amounts of vocabulary must be acquired in a limited amount of time, when the learner needs to recall information quickly, when words represent abstract concepts or are difficult to picture in a mental image, or when discriminating between false friends, rote memorization is the method to use. A neural network model of novel word learning across orthographies, accounting for L1-specific memorization abilities of L2-learners has recently been introduced (Hadzibeganovic and Cannas, 2009).

===== The keyword method =====
One way of learning vocabulary is to use mnemonic devices or to create associations between words, this is known as the &quot;keyword method&quot; (Sagarra and Alba, 2006). It also takes a long time to implement — and takes a long time to recollect — but because it makes a few new strange ideas connect it may help in learning. Also it presumably does not conflict with Paivio&#x27;s dual coding system because it uses visual and verbal mental faculties. However, this is still best used for words that represent concrete things, as abstract concepts are more difficult to remember.

==== Word lists ====
Several word lists have been developed to provide people with a limited vocabulary for rapid language proficiency or for effective communication. These include Basic English (850 words), Special English (1,500 words), General Service List (2,000 words), and Academic Word List. Some learner&#x27;s dictionaries have developed defining vocabularies which contain only most common and basic words. As a result, word definitions in such dictionaries can be understood even by learners with a limited vocabulary. Some publishers produce dictionaries based on word frequency or thematic groups.

The Swadesh list was made for investigation in linguistics.

== Focal vocabulary ==
Focal vocabulary is a specialized set of terms and distinctions that is particularly important to a certain group: those with a particular focus of experience or activity. A lexicon, or vocabulary, is a language&#x27;s dictionary: its set of names for things, events, and ideas. Some linguists believe that lexicon influences people&#x27;s perception of things, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. For example, the Nuer of Sudan have an elaborate vocabulary to describe cattle. The Nuer have dozens of names for cattle because of the cattle&#x27;s particular histories, economies, and environments. This kind of comparison has elicited some linguistic controversy, as with the number of &quot;Eskimo words for snow&quot;. English speakers with relevant specialised knowledge can also display elaborate and precise vocabularies for snow and cattle when the need arises.

<text>Pierre-Antoine Berryer (4 January 179029 November 1868) was a French advocate and parliamentary orator. He was the twelfth member elected to occupy Seat Four of the Académie française in 1852.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Berryer was born in Paris, the son of an eminent advocate and counselor to the &quot;parlement&quot;, a direct descendent from the first recorded members of the Berryer family originating from Jean de Candie, lord of Berryer in Bourges, in the person of Denis de Candie de la Berryer, royal commissioner of waters and forests of Domfront and Le Mans (died in 1630).

He was educated at the Collège de Juilly. Upon leaving he adopted the law profession. He was admitted advocate in 1811. He married in that same year. In the great conflict of the period between Napoleon I and the Bourbons, Berryer, like his father, was an ardent Legitimist. In the spring of 1815, at the opening of the campaign of the Hundred Days, he followed Louis XVIII of France to Ghent as a volunteer.

===Career===

After the second restoration he distinguished himself as a courageous advocate of moderation in the treatment of the military adherents of the emperor. He assisted his father and Dupin in the unsuccessful defence of Marshal Ney before the chamber of peers. He undertook the defence of General Cambronne and General Debelle, procuring the acquittal of the former and the pardon of the latter. By this time he had a very large business as advocate, and was engaged on behalf of journalists in many press prosecutions.

Berryer stood forward with a noble resolution to maintain the freedom of the press, and he severely censured the rigorous measures of the police department. In 1830, not long before the fall of Charles X, Berryer was elected to the chamber of deputies. He appeared there as the champion of the king and encouraged him in his reactionary policy. After the revolution of July, when the Legitimists withdrew in a body, Berryer alone retained his seat as deputy. He unsuccessfully resisted the abolition of the hereditary peerage. He advocated trial by jury in press prosecutions, the extension of municipal franchises, and other liberal measures.

In May 1832, he hastened from Paris to see the Duchess of Berry on her landing in the south of France. Her purpose was to organize an insurrection in favour of her son, the Duke of Bordeaux, who has since become known as the Comte de Chambord. Berryer attempted to turn her from her purpose. Failing to do, he set out for Switzerland. But he was arrested, imprisoned, and brought to trial as one of the insurgents. He was immediately acquitted. In the following year he pleaded for the liberation of the duchess, made a memorable speech in defence of François-René de Chateaubriand, who was prosecuted for his violent attacks on the government of Louis-Philippe of France, and undertook the defence of several Legitimist journalists.

Among the more noteworthy events of his subsequent career were his defence of Louis Napoleon after the ridiculous affair of Boulogne in 1840, and a visit to England in December 1843 for the purpose of formally acknowledging the pretender Henri, comte de Chambord who was then living in London as &quot;Henry V&quot; and lawful king of France. Berryer was an active member of the National Assembly convoked after the revolution of February 1848. He again visited the pretender, then at Wiesbaden, and fought in the old cause. His long parliamentary career came to an end with a courageous protest against the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 2 December 1851.

After a lapse of twelve years, however, he appeared once more in his forsaken field as a deputy to the &quot;Corps Législatif&quot;. Berryer was elected as a member of the Académie française in 1854. On his visit to Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux in 1865, a banquet was given in his honour by the benchers of the Temple and of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. In November 1868, he left Paris of his own volition to retire to his country seat at Augerville, and there he died on 29 November.

<doc id="191453" wikidata="Q2738694" url="?curid=191453" title="Waki Yamato">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. She debuted in 1966 with the short story &quot;Dorobō Tenshi&quot;.

Since her debut, Yamato steadily created and published a variety of works in the genre of manga. Among her early time works, &quot;Mon Cherie CoCo&quot;, 1971, was adapted into an anime television series, and her work, &quot;Haikara-san ga Tōru&quot;, 1975 to 1977, was very successful, winning the 1st Kodansha Manga Award for manga in 1977. It was also made into a musical for the Takarazuka Revue, an anime series (which reached an international audience through TV broadcasts in Italy and France), and a live-action film. Through these early works, she established her position as one of the most popular manga artists.

== Life and works ==
After the success of &quot;Haikara-san ga Tōru&quot;, she continued to create many manga, including the comedy &quot;Aramis &#x27;78&quot; (series), &quot;Yokohama Monogatari&quot; (The Story of Yokohama), and &quot;N. Y. Komachi&quot; (The Belle of New York). The latter two were historical manga, set during the Meiji period.

The heroines of these stories were active girls who traveled overseas. Yamato&#x27;s early work &quot;Reidii Mitsuko&quot; (Lady Mitsuko), 1976, was based on the true story of Mitsuko Aoyama, who was the mother of Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi.

Similarly, in &quot;Yokohama Monogatari&quot;, Uno visits California, marries her Japanese lover there and returns to Yokohama, while Mariko visits London to meet her Japanese husband. In &quot;N. Y. Komachi&quot; tomboy Shino travels to New York and becomes a camerawoman. At the end she settles in America with her husband Danny.

=== Asaki Yume Mishi ===
Yamato&#x27;s major work is &quot;Asaki Yume Mishi&quot;. Yamato spent 13 years (1980–93) completing this famous long work, based on Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. Yamato studied the historical details of the Heian period. But she made radical changes to the characters and plot, to fit contemporary mores. Yet her work remains one of the best visualizations of the Heian era.

== List of works ==
Book information from Media Arts Database. (in progress, incomplete).


== Reception ==
Yamato&#x27;s story manga &quot;Haikara-san ga Tōru&quot; series had been sold over 10 million copies. Also, the total sales number of her representative work &quot;Asaki YUmemishi&quot; had been over 12 million, as of 1997.

<doc id="191454" wikidata="Q5199419" url="?curid=191454" title="Cymbal alloys">
<text>Cymbals are made from four main alloys, all of them copper-based. These are: bell bronze, malleable bronze, brass, and nickel silver.

==Bell bronze==

Bell bronze, also known as &quot;bell metal&quot;, is the traditional alloy used for fine cymbals, many gongs, and, as the name suggests, bells.
It is normally stated to be one part tin to four parts copper, that is 20% tin, and this is still the most common formula, but there has always been some variation. Larger and smaller bells are cast with differing amounts of tin, and some bell, gong, and cymbal makers use small but significant amounts of other elements, notably silver, gold, and phosphorus.
Bell bronze is a two-phase alloy, meaning some of the tin is not dissolved in the copper grains but exists between them. This makes the metal harder and more brittle than a single-phase alloy,
and also affects the way the metal responds to hardening by hammering and lathing, and greatly restricts the use of mechanised techniques of manufacture. Major orchestras generally use bell-bronze cymbals, which are capable of a greater dynamic range than any others. They are also generally the preferred cymbals of drum kit players.

==Signature Bronze Alloys==

In 1989 Paiste released professional cymbal series composed of sheet metal bronze with about 15% tin. Though the manufacturing requires the metal to be rolled hot at certain stages, it is not tempered like traditional B20 cymbals but annealed. Using this alloy allows for greater consistency between blanks compared to traditional cymbal alloy, and is more applicable to Paiste&#x27;s 2002 production methods. Examples include Paiste Signatures, Traditionals and Dark Energy. Paiste calls this &quot;Signature Bronze&quot; or &quot;Sound Formula&quot;. For a time, Paiste produced no bell metal cymbals, but now produces high-end cymbals of both this alloy and bell bronze. Since then, other manufactures followed the lead and implemented lines of high tin sheet metal alloy. Zildjian Project 391 series employed Paiste alloy explicitly, however many companies (Zildjian included) produce cymbals with B12 (Such as Zildjian ZHT, now S series) and B10 alloys. Meinl cymbals are well known for employing both alloys.
There is some evidence that a similar sheet alloy was used by the Hammerax company (though with added iron and nickel). 
==Malleable bronze==

Malleable bronze is an alloy of tin and copper containing typically 8% tin. It is a single-phase alloy and can be cold rolled into sheets, unlike bell bronze. It is readily available as commercial sheet metal in many grades and thicknesses.

Cymbal bronzes containing 8% tin are most normally called &quot;B8 alloy&quot;. Paiste refer to their 8% tin bronze as &quot;2002 alloy&quot;.

From the mid 20th century there were attempts to make top-quality cymbals from malleable bronze, originally for reasons of economy. As the Paiste patent referred to above says:

&quot;Less than three decades ago experiments were carried out for economical considerations with a commercial common bronze sheet or plating containing 8% tin by weight. The result was that the old bronze rule was confirmed and proven to be correct. One had to realize that with careful working and processing of the cymbal it was possible to achieve considerable qualitative results with the bronze sheet or plating containing 8% by weight tin, but these results could never approach the results obtained with traditional cymbals having a tin content of 20% by weight.&quot;

Not everyone agrees with this unfavourable assessment, written well after the development of the very successful Paiste 2002 series. In particular, top-line malleable bronze cymbals proved exceptionally suitable for the louder music then developing. The best of them now approach, and some claim equal, the best bell bronze cymbals in quality.

Examples of malleable bronze cymbals include: Harpy H, Meinl One of a Kind, Meinl Custom and Amun,
Meinl Lightning and Raker, Meinl Classics and some Generation X,
Meinl Trooper and Cadet, Orion Solo Pro and Solo Pro Master, Orion Viziuss, Paiste 2002 and Giant Beat, Paiste 802 and Alpha, Paiste 502 and some Exotic Percussion, Pearl Pro, Meinl MCS, Sabian B8 and B8 Pro, Sabian Pro, Sabian Pro Sonix, Sabian APX, Sabian B8X, Soultone Custom Brilliant, Soultone Extreme, Soultone Natural, Soultone Vintage, Soultone Vintage OldSchool 1964, Soultone Gospel, UFIP Tiger, UFIP Supernova, Zildjian I Series, ZBT, ZXT, ZHT, and the sonic &quot;XXX&quot; series by Krash Cymbalz, a B10 alloy line for the heavy-handed, aggressive drummer.

==Brass==

Some of the finest traditional gongs and china-type cymbals and nearly all zills are made from brass. However, it is not widely used in cymbals. Brass cymbals are inexpensive beginners&#x27; cymbals, not meant to last long; the rigidity of brass yields cymbals harsh in sound and very prone to cracks at the bell hole and the border. 

Many of the &quot;show&quot; cymbals provided by many drum kit manufacturers for use in shop window displays are also made from brass. These are typically very poor in tone, some even being disks of untreated metal and unplayable despite the reputable brand name they may bear.

The brass for cymbals is about 38% zinc in copper, which is very easily worked, readily available as sheet metal, and easily the cheapest metal stock normally used for cymbals. The tone of brass cymbals tends to be warm but dull compared to any sort of tin bronze, and very few drummers exploit it.

Examples of brass cymbals include: Harpy B, Meinl Marathon M38, Meinl Meteor, Meinl HCS, Orion Twister, Paiste 101, Paiste 302 and some Exotic Percussion, Pearl, Royal, Twister Series by Orion, Solar and Sbr by Sabian, Soultone Intro, UFIP M8, Planet Z by Zildjian. Nearly all zils of all makes are also made out of brass.

==Nickel silver==

Nickel silver as used in cymbal making is an alloy of copper and nickel, and an alloy with about 12% nickel is used for some beginners&#x27; cymbals.
A very few specialised high-quality cymbals are also made from nickel silver, as are some top-quality gongs tending to the more modern and exotic sounds.

Some maintain that the term &quot;nickel silver&quot; should only be used for alloys containing an appreciable content of zinc, and would call this cymbal alloy nickel bronze instead, but the use of the term &quot;nickel silver&quot; for all cymbal bronzes with nickel as the main alloying metal is well established.

Nickel silver is malleable and available as commercial sheet metal, and gives a bright tone but without the shimmer and sensitivity of tin bronzes. In the early to mid 20th century nickel alloy cymbals were far more widely produced and used, and so many older recordings were probably made using cymbals with a significant nickel content.

Evelyn Glennie is particularly noted for exploiting the tones of nickel silver cymbals.

Examples of nickel silver cymbals include: Some Foremost, Meinl Streamer and Marathon N12, Paiste 402, the original 1970s Paiste 101 (current 101s are Brass) and some Exotic Percussion, Sabian Signature Glennies Garbage, and some Zilco.

==Other metals==

Cymbals have also been made from silicon and aluminum bronzes but these alloys have not become generally popular.

Meinl FX9 is an alloy of 69% copper, 15% manganese, 15% zinc and 1% aluminium, and was used for the new Meinl Generation X line released in 2003. Previous Generation X models were made from malleable bronze. FX9 is described by Meinl as not being a bronze at all, and was previously described by their sales literature as containing tin rather than zinc. There is a minority view that the word &quot;bronze&quot; should be reserved for two-phase alloys, which may be their usage here.

Unlike cymbals, some gongs are made from several different metals fused together. Many different metals have been used. Parts of some traditional gongs, notably the bosses of some &quot;nipple&quot; gongs, are made from iron based alloys.

A few independent cymbal makers have also used stainless steel and titanium to produce cymbals and gongs.

<text>André Marie Jean Jacques Dupin (1 February 17838 November 1865), commonly called Dupin the Elder, was a French advocate, president of the chamber of deputies and of the Legislative Assembly.

Dupin was born at Varzy, in the Nièvre &quot;département&quot;, in France. He was educated by his father, who was a lawyer of eminence, and at an early age he became principal clerk of an attorney at Paris. On the establishment of the Académie de Legislation he entered it as pupil from Nièvre. In 1800 he was made advocate, and in 1802, when the schools of law were opened, he received successively the degrees of licentiate and doctor from the new faculty. He was in 1810 an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of law at Paris, and in 1811 he also failed to obtain the office of advocate-general at the Court of Cassation. About this time he was added to the commission charged with the classification of the laws of the empire, and, after the interruption caused by the events of 1814 and 1815, was charged with the sole care of that great work. In May 1815 he entered the Chamber of Representatives and at once took an active part in the debates as a member of the Liberal Opposition, and strenuously opposed the election of the son of Napoleon as emperor after his father&#x27;s abdication.

At the election after the second restoration Dupin was not reelected. He defended with great intrepidity the principal political victims of the reaction, among others, in conjunction with , Marshal Ney; and in October 1815 boldly published a tractate entitled &quot;Libre Defense des accusés&quot;. In 1827, he was elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies and in 1830 he voted the address of the 221, and on 28 February he was in the streets exhorting the citizens to resistance. At the end of 1832, he became president of the chamber, which office he held successively for eight years. After the 1848 abdication of Louis Philippe, Dupin introduced the young Count of Paris into the chamber, and proposed him as king with his mother as regent.

This attempt failed, but Dupin submitted to circumstances, and, retaining the office of , his first act was to decide that justice should henceforth be rendered to the &quot;name of the French people.&quot; In 1849, he was elected a member of the Assembly, and became president of the principal committee—that on legislation. After the 1851 coup d&#x27;état, he still retained his office of , and did not resign it until effect was given to the decrees confiscating the property of the house of Orléans. In 1857, he was offered his old office by emperor Napoleon III, and accepted it, explaining his acceptance in a discourse, a sentence of which may be employed to describe his whole political career. &quot;I have always&quot;, he said, &quot;belonged to France and never to parties.&quot;

Among Dupin&#x27;s works, which are numerous, may be mentioned &quot;Principia Juris Civilis&quot;, 5 vols. (1806); &quot;Mémoires et plaidoyers de 1800 au 1ier janvier 1830&quot;, in 20 vols.; and &quot;Mémoires ou souvenirs du barreau&quot;, in 4 vols. (1855–1857).

His brother, Pierre Charles François Dupin, was a mathematician.
