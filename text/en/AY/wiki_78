<text>Morelia (; from 1545 to 1828 known as Valladolid; Otomi: ) is a city and municipal seat of the municipality of Morelia in the north-central part of the state of Michoacán in central Mexico. It is both the most populous and most densely populated municipality in Michoacán. The city is in the Guayangareo Valley and is the capital and largest city of the state. The main pre-Hispanic cultures here were the Purépecha and the Matlatzinca, but no major cities were founded in the valley during this time. The Spanish took control of the area in the 1520s. The Spanish under Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza founded a settlement here in 1541 with the name of Valladolid, which became rival to the nearby city of Pátzcuaro for dominance in Michoacán. In 1580, this rivalry ended in Valladolid&#x27;s favor, and it became the capital of the viceregal province. After the Mexican War of Independence, the city was renamed Morelia in honor of José María Morelos, who hailed from the city. In 1991, the city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its well-preserved historical buildings and layout of the historic center. It is tradition to name people born on September 30 after the city.

The city population in 2020 was 743,275 inhabitants. The municipality had 849,053 inhabitants, and the Metropolitan Area, composed of Morelia, Tarímbaro, and Charo municipalities, had 988,704 inhabitants, according to the XIV Census.

==History==

Human settlements in the Guayangareo Valley in which Morelia is located have been dated back as far as the 7th century. Artifacts found here have shown Teotihuacán culture influence on early cultures in this area. In the 12th century, the Purépecha arrived in the valley. They dominated it politically for the rest of the pre-Hispanic period but did not build any major settlements here. Between the 12th and the 15th centuries, Matlatzincas moved into the area with permission of the Purépechas, who were based around nearby Pátzcuaro Lake 
. The main Matlatzinca settlement was where Júarez Plaza in the city is today.

The Spanish pushed into the Guayangareo Valley between 1525 and 1526, headed by Gonzalo Gómez. In the 1530s, the area was evangelized by Franciscans such as Juan de San Miguel and Antonio de Lisboa.

What would become the city of Morelia was founded by Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza and a number of encomenderos in 1541, who first named it Nueva Ciudad de Michoacán (New City of Michoacán). The newly founded settlement grew quickly, prompting Vasco de Quiroga to go to Spain and procure for rival settlement Pátzcuaro the title of city and a seal, to prevent the “new city” from becoming the capital of Michoacán. The action also required that the new settlement change its name to Guayangareo. In 1545, Guayangareo gained city status from Charles V with the name of &quot;Valladolid,&quot; after the hometown of Antonio de Mendoza. This was part of a power struggle between Antonio de Mendoza and Vasco de Quiroga over the province of Michoacán. During Quiroga&#x27;s lifetime, he managed to keep political and ecclesiastical power in Pátzcuaro despite the viceroy&#x27;s and encomenderos’ objections. Quiroga died in 1565, however, and by 1580, both political and religious authority (Episcopal see) had been transferred to the city of Valladolid, moving the College of San Nicolás, which Vasco founded and laying the groundwork for establishing a new cathedral for the province.

The 17th century saw growth for Valladolid, with the construction of the cathedral and aqueduct. The cathedral was begun in 1660 (finished in 1744) and the aqueduct in 1657. Both of these structures would later be worked on in the 18th century by Master Architect of Valladolid, Diego Durán. During the 17th century, many of the city&#x27;s large churches and monasteries were established, such as the monasteries of San Francisco, San Agustin, El Carmen, and La Merced as well as the convents of Las Rosas, Las Monjas and Capuchinas. Churches include La Compañía, San Juan, and La Cruz, but the most important structure built during this time period was the cathedral. The location of this cathedral defined the composition and development of the city from then on.

At the end of the viceregal period, Valladolid was a small city with about 20,000 inhabitants. It was also an educational center with four important schools such as the College of San Nicolás. These schools would turn out scholars such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and José María Morelos y Pavón, who were sympathetic to the new republican ideas coming out of post-revolution France and the United States. Demonstrations against Spanish rule had been occurring in the town in 1809, culminating in the Conspiracy of 1809. This plot was discovered, with the main conspirators were arrested and sent to other parts of New Spain, which helped to spread republican ideas.

One year later, after forming his army in Guanajuato state, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla arrived and took over the city, proclaiming the end of slavery in Mexico. The city was taken back by royalist forces soon after. Morelos came here to try and dislodge the royalists but was defeated by Agustín de Iturbide. Another prominent figure in the war, Mariano Matamoros was shot by firing squad on the city&#x27;s main square in 1814. The city remained in royalist&#x27;s hands until 1821, Iturbide, who had switched sides, and Vicente Guerrero entered the city with the Trigarante Army.

In 1828, the newly created state of Michoacán changed the name of the city from Valladolid to Morelia, in honor of José María Morelos y Pavón. This is the official name it retains today, although its Purépecha name remains Uaianarhio and has had nicknames such as City of Pink (Cantera) Stone, the City of Open Doors, The Rose of the Winds, The Garden of New Spain and religiously as Morelia of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The city became a municipality in 1831.

The later 19th century is marked by struggles between liberal and conservatives forces in Mexico. During the Revolution of Ayutla, the city was taken by rebel forces under Epitacio Huerta and General García Pueblita, but was taken back in 1855 by forces under Antonio López de Santa Anna. Rebels attacked Santa Anna&#x27;s troops again a year later. French troops imposing imperial rule entered the city in 1863, with the republican forces moving the capital of Michoacán to Uruapan while conservative families in Morelia pledged support for emperor Maximilian I, who then visited the city. In 1867, the city was taken by republican general Nicolás de Régules and the capital of Michoacán returned to Morelia. In 1869, during a rebellion against Benito Juárez’s government, General Epitacio Huerta attacked government positions in the city but were beaten back by forces under Mariano Escobedo.
The first factories were opened in the city between 1868 and 1870, along with the first telegraph line. The railroad followed in 1883, as well as streetcars.

In 1910, celebrations are held for the centennial of Independence but tensions are high in the city due to the shortage of grain and the continuation of President Porfirio Diaz in power. One year later, revolutionaries loyal to Francisco I. Madero are welcomed into the city. In 1914, the capital was moved from Morelia to the city of Tacámbaro. The city was then taken by forces under General Sánchez in the same year, and by forces loyal to Francisco Villa in 1915.

In 1920, the Palace of the State Government was briefly taken over by farmworkers and others from all over the state. Isaac Arriaga is assassinated here in 1921. The city is attacked again by rebels calling themselves “Delahuertistas” in 1924. The fight mostly occurs in the main plaza with the city defended by General Lopez, Garcia, and Avila Camacho.

Morelia was the location for the 1958 film &quot;The Bravados&quot; starring Gregory Peck and Joan Collins. Filming was difficult because it was unusually rainy and cold for the region.

During the 1960s the street vendors were removed from the historic center of the city, and palm trees that lined the Avenida Madero, the main east-west road, were cut down. In 1966, there was a student revolt at the state university which was put down by the army.

The 1970s and 1980s are marked by construction including the Periferico bypass ring around the city. During the 1980s, damage due to geographic faults, exacerbated by falling water tables from groundwater pumping is noticed. This problem is similar to problems faced by other cities on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt such as Querétaro and Mexico City.

In 1991, the city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its well-preserved architecture. In 2001, street vendors were moved again from the historic center to make the area more tourist-friendly. Traffic was rerouted from here as well with the construction of new bypasses. In 2006 and 2007, many of the plazas and gardens in the historic center were remodeled.

In 2008, eight people were killed in a grenade attack.

In 2009, the Morelia metropolitan area was tentatively established as consisting of the municipalities of Zinapécuaro, Álvaro Obregón, Charo, Tarímbaro and Morelia. This initial determination was made by the Secretary of Urbanism and Environment, with further refinements to be made as the municipal presidents of these entities meets to discuss limits, strategies and further actions. One of these actions has been to establish a formal commission to administer the area.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Morelia has a subtropical highland climate (abbreviated &quot;Cwb&quot; on climate maps), with warm-to-hot days and cool nights year round due to its high elevation. Most precipitation falls during the summer monsoon season from June to September. Average monthly temperatures are between , with maximum temperatures of in the summer of 1998 and the lowest temperature of in January 1985.
== Population ==
The city of Morelia is the most populous city in the state of Michoacán and the third most important in the Bajío Region, just behind León de Los Aldama and Querétaro City.
In the most recent census carried out by Inegi in 2020 the city registered a population of 743,275 inhabitants, an increase of almost 145,000 inhabitants over the previous census carried out in 2010 when it had a population of 597,511.

==Notable sites==

Almost all of Morelia&#x27;s notable sites lie in its historic center. This historic center is roughly equivalent to the original layout of the city when it was founded in 1541, and most of this layout has survived intact to the present day. Anticipating growth, this original layout had very wide streets and plazas for the time, with streets systematically arranged to allow for elongation. The streets are systematically laid out, but not rigidly squared, with most having gentle curves designed into them. Most of the grandest structures were completed during the 18th century, including the facade and bell towers of the cathedral, the Colegio Seminario (today the State Government Palace), La Alhóndiga (today part of the Palace of Justice) and numerous private mansions. During the same time period, infrastructure such as the city&#x27;s aqueduct and various plaza fountains were constructed. The Mexican federal government lists 1,113 buildings built from the 16th to the 20th centuries as having historical value. The buildings encompass the various architectural styles that have been fashionable in Mexico, but nearly all are built of pink Cantera stone, which gives the city a unified appearance. Several measures were taken in the 20th century to preserve this part of the city. In 1956, the city enacted regulations to preserve the historic center&#x27;s colonial buildings. In 1990, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari issued a decree making the historic center of Morelia a national historic monument. In 1991, the same area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, which covers 200 of the area&#x27;s historic buildings.
The heart of the historic center is the cathedral and its surrounding plazas: the Plaza de Armas, also known as the Plaza de los Mártires, the Juárez Plaza and the Melchor Ocampo Plaza. The largest plaza is the Plaza de Armas, which has been remodeled several times since it was designed in the 16th century. It has been renamed several times as well, from “de la Constitución,” “de la República” to the current official name of “de los Mártires” but popularly it retains the name of “Plaza de Armas.” The alternate name, Plaza de los Mártires (Plaza of the Martyrs) is in honor of people like Mariano Matamoros, Guadalupe el Salto and others who were executed here during the Mexican War of Independence and later in 1830 during political unrest. The plaza is surrounded by portals, and colonial era buildings such as the Banca Promex, the Virrey de Mendoza Hotel, the Juan de Dios Gomez House and the old town hall, also called the Michelena House. Until the late 19th century, a monument to Morelos had been here, but this was removed along with the fountain and replaced by a kiosk that was brought from London and remains to this day. The last remodeling of the plaza occurred in the mid-20th century under the direction of architect and painter Juan O&#x27;Gorman. The Melchor Ocampo Plaza was originally named “Plaza de la Paz.” In the late 19th century, this plaza was remodeled and a monument to Ocampo sculpted by Primitivo Miranda was placed here. Another statue by Miranda, this one of Jose Maria Morelos y Pavon was placed in the small plaza on the west side of the cathedral and named the Morelos Plaza.

The first church on the Cathedral site was built in 1577, which was a modest structure of adobe and wood. Many years later, this structure would be almost completely destroyed by a fire. Originally, the Cathedral of Michoacán was in Pátzcuaro in a church that now is the Basilica of Nuestra Señora de la Salud. When cathedral status was moved from there to Valladolid in 1580, the city became the civil, religious, and cultural capital of the territory. In 1660, Bishop Marcos Ramírez del Prado, placed the first stone of the new cathedral, which was designed by Vicenzo Barocco. Of the major churches of the early colonial period, only this and the Mexico City Cathedral do not face west, as was customary. The Cathedral of Michoacán is also unique in that it is dedicated to the Transfiguration of Jesus, rather than some form of the Virgin Mary. The cathedral was consecrated in 1705, even though it was not yet finished. The facade as a relief of the Transfiguration of Christ and the east nave is dedicated to the sheepherders and Wise Men of the Nativity. Built of pink Cantera stone, the cathedral&#x27;s two towers still dominate the skyline of the city, and are the second tallest Baroque towers in Mexico.

The cathedral&#x27;s official name is Cathedral of the Divine Savior of Morelia. Since it was built over the 17th and 18th centuries, elements of Neoclassical, Herreresque, and Baroque architecture can be seen in the building. The facade of the cathedral is mostly decorated in pilasters rather than columns and relieves rather than sculptures. There are more than two hundred pilasters but no columns, the only church built this way during the colonial period.

Inside, there are a number of elements that stand out. The baptismal font was made of silver in the 19th century and was used to baptize Mexico&#x27;s first emperor, Agustín de Iturbide. A monstrance made of pure silver adorns the main altar and is unique in that it can be disassembled and reassembled. Also on the altar is a 16th-century cornstalk paste image of the Señor de la Sacristía (Lord of the Sacristy), whose gold crown was a gift from Philip II of Spain. A newer addition is the organ from Germany, which has 4,600 pipes and is one of the largest in Latin America. On Saturdays at 8:45  pm the cathedral sponsors a sound-and-light show.

In front of the cathedral is the old Seminario Tridentino de San Pedro, one of the educational institutions of the colonial city. Today it is the Palace of the State Government. It was constructed by Thomás de Huerta in the late 18th century. The school had graduates such as José María Morelos and Melchor Ocampo. The facade is mostly original, with only the seal of Mexico having been added in the mid-19th century, when this building was converted for use as the seat of the Michoacán state government. Inside are three courtyards with the walls of the first courtyard covered in murals done by Alfredo Zalce in the 1960s.
Traslado de las Monjas in the museum of the Casa de la Cultura is also the home of the Instituto Michoacano de Cultura (Michoacan Institute of Culture) and the State Secretary of Culture. It is in the former monastery of Nuestra Señora del Carmen Descalzo, which was established in 1593. The church building was probably finished in 1619, the date inscribed on the south portal, but monastery construction continued into the 17th century. In the 19th century, the Reform Laws expropriated the cloisters and living quarters but left the church to its religious function, which continues to this day. After expropriation, the monastery area was first used as the home of the Primer Cuerpo de Caballería del Estado (First Cavalry Corps of the State). Over time the church fell into disrepair but was restored in the 1940s. The rest of the complex was restored and converted to its present function starting in 1977.

The Orquidario of Morelia is an orchid museum which houses approximately 3,400 species of the flower. The botanical garden consists of three greenhouses with some outside space. The museum is managed by SEMARNAT as part of a program to preserve wild species. The botanical garden has a surface area of over and was founded in 1980.

The Museo Regional Michoacano (Regional Museum of Michoacán) was founded in 1886 and its design was heavily influenced by French ideas of museum design of the time. It is housed in a building that belonged to Emperor Maximilian I, and is of ornate Baroque design. Most of the exhibits are about the history of the region with rooms dedicated to pre-Hispanic artifacts and colonial art. One noted piece is the painting called “Traslado de las Monjas” which is considered to be the finest work produced in Michoacán during the colonial period. Other important works include the original volume of the Voyage de Humboldt et Bonpland, edited in Paris in 1807 and the murals done by Alfredo Zalce, Federico Cantú and Grace Greenwood. There are also interactive exhibits on the origins of the earth and life. The museum also has conference rooms, a library, and a reading room.

The Museo del Estado (The State Museum) is dedicated to the state&#x27;s past and present. It was opened in 1986 and divided into three sections – archeology, history and ethnology of the state. There is also an exhibit of the old Mier Pharmacy with its equipment from 1868. The museum is a mansion dating from the 18th century.

The Museo de Arte Colonial (Museum of Colonial Art) holds a collection of documents, old books, religious ornaments and maps from the colonial period. The museum&#x27;s main attraction is its collection of more than 100 figures of Christ done in cornstalk paste. These figures were created by Indigenous artists, starting under the direction of Vasco de Quiroga, between the 16th and 19th centuries. There are also paintings done by Miguel Cabrera and José Padilla from the 18th century. The museum is in an old Baroque residence from the 18th century. Prior to the building&#x27;s use as a museum, it was the site of the first official government press in the state, founded in 1821.

The Casa Museum José María Morelos y Pavón (José María Morelos y Pavón House Museum) contains a collection of items from the colonial and early independence periods of Mexico&#x27;s history, including articles that belonged to Morelos himself. Morelos bought the house in 1802, but did not live there much, especially in the years just before and during the Mexican War of Independence because of his involvement with the movement. In 1933, the house was declared a national monument and in 1939 became the property of INAH to be converted into this museum. Later, the building underwent another round of restoration work and was re-inaugurated in 1991. The lower level is mostly dedicated to Morelos with the rooms on the upper level dedicated to the war in general. The museum is also the archive of the Bishopric of Michoacán and contains documents from the 16th to the 20th centuries.
The Casa Natal de Morelos (Morelos’ Birthplace) is the house where José María Morelos y Pavón was born in 1765. The building is a large mansion with a Neoclassic facade and a Baroque interior. In 1888, the original building was destroyed to build a farmhouse. This is the building that has been restored and turned into a museum in 1964, for the coming bicentennial of Morelos’ birth. The museum contains documents and belongings of Morelos including ones he signed, money he had coined, paintings and a large library.

The Museo de la Máscara (Mask Museum) presents two different mask collections, totaling more than 165 examples from cultures in twenty Mexican states. It is located in the Casa de Artesanias de Morelia (Handcraft House of Morelia).

The Museo de Arte Contemporáneo Alfredo Zalce (Alfredo Zalce Museum of Contemporary Art) mostly contains works done by Alfredo Zalce and Efraín Vargas, both renowned Michoacán painters. It also holds temporary exhibits by Mexican and international artists.

The Plaza Monumental de Morelia was established in 1951, which was destined exclusively for bullfights. Nowadays, the ring also hosts concerts, lucha libre, and weddings.

The was first documented in 1549. It was used to transport fresh water to the required destination so that the inhabitants of the city could access it. The water system was made of used wood from canoes in the area to create the base structure during its construction. As years passed with the use of the aqueduct constantly changing, there was an incident that occurred in 1784. The incident was that part of the Morelia aqueduct foundation collapsed, leaving hundreds without access to the water. On October 21, 1785, a document detailed the reconstruction of the aqueduct, and a man named Fray Antonio de San Miguel volunteered to make a plan for the reconstruction of the structure. With Fray Antonio&#x27;s plans, they completely reconstructed the arches and added fixtures to repair the previous damage. As the repairs were completed the aqueduct remained in use until it stopped functioning in 1910; it remains standing to this day. The whole Aqueduct structure consisted of 253 arches (some of which have collapsed over the years), at a height of .

In front of the Aqueduct is the &quot;Fuente de las Tarascas&quot;, one of the most popular fountains in the city. The current version was installed in 1984.

==Festivals==
The Festival Internacional de Música de Morelia is an annual event that was begun in 1988 by Bernal Jiménez, who had the dream of making Morelia the “Salzburg of Americas”. The festival consists of more than forty concerts with over 500 artists participating. It has become the largest music festival in Morelia, with private and government sponsors, esp. CONACULTA. Concerts include those by chamber orchestras, choirs, ensambles, trios and soloists such as pianist Joanna MacGregor and the Britten Symphony. Each year, a different country is the “special guest,” which in 2009 was the United Kingdom. In that year, some of the participants included the London Symphony Orchestra, the Brodsky Quartet, La Britten Symphony Orchestra, the Coro Nova Schola Gregoriana Di Verona of Italy, and violinist Tanya Anisimova from Russia. Participants from Mexico included the National Symphonic Orchestra, the Orquesta Sinfónica de Minería and flautist Horacio Franco.

The Festival Internacional de Cine de Morelia was begun in 2003, and is mostly dedicated to Mexican cinema, showcasing up-and-coming directors and productions. The majority of activities take place in the Cinépolis Morelia Centro, but also includes other theaters, auditoriums and public plazas.

Morelia is the site of the annual Zapata Vive Morelia Festival, which celebrates the life of Emiliano Zapata with cultural and political activities. The purpose of the event is to promote exhibitions by artistic, cultural and social organizations from the state of Michoacán and other parts of the country. Events are spread out over several days and include ones such as concerts, round tables and information sessions. The event encourages those organizations who work with the lower social classes and are politically left to participate.

The Festival de Escala is an annual event dedicated to promoting rock climbing in the municipality at places such as El Paredón de la Noria, just south of the city proper.

A popular festival that features a 3-day Salsa competition in the heart of Morelia is called &quot;SalsaMich&quot;. Typically held in March, the festival brings Salsa dancers from all across the country to Morelia to compete for prizes.

==Sister cities==

Morelia has a sister city relationship with Yakima, Washington, supported since 1999 by the Yakima-Morelia Sister City Association. Cultural exchanges between the cities have included musicians from Morelia who have performed with the Yakima Symphony Orchestra.

Morelia has other sister cities around the world, including: Arequipa in Peru; Caspueñas, Valladolid, and Madrigal de las Altas Torres in Spain; Gettysburg, Kansas City, Fullerton, Monterey Park, Norwalk, and Shreveport in the United States; Matanzas and Havana in Cuba; and Sopó in Colombia.

==Education==
During the colonial period the city had four major educational institutions, the Colegio Seminario Tridentino, the Colegio de San Nicolás, the Colegio de los Jesuitas and the Colegio de las Rosas.
The state university, the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, is the oldest university in the Americas, which has its origins in the college founded in 1540 by Vasco de Quiroga in Pátzcuaro, the Colegio de San Nicolás Obispo. This school was founded to train priests and missionaries for work in Michoacán. The school gained a royal seal and patronage in 1543. In 1566, colonial religious authorities took over the school and in 1574, academics here were under the jurisdiction of the Jesuits. With the episcopal seat changed to Valladolid, the school moved also in 1580 and was fused with the already existing Colegio de San Miguel Guayangareo. The school was reformed in the 17th century and its curriculum was redesigned in the 18th to include courses in philosophy, religious law, civil law and other subjects. At the beginning the 19th century, the school became one of New Spain&#x27;s main centers of learning and academia, producing scholars such as a Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, José Ma. Morelos, José Sixto Verduzco, José María Izazaga and Ignacio López Rayón, most of whom would have a role in the upcoming Mexican War of Independence. The school closed during the war but was reopened in 1847 with the name Primitivo y Nacional Colegio de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, focusing more on secular studies such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, etc. based on the European university model.

After the Mexican Revolution, the school was reorganized and renamed again to the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo in 1917, which consolidated a number of other schools and disciplines into the new organization.

Nowadays, the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo is the most important university in the state of Michoacán. It has been rated also as one of the Top 10 best public universities in Mexico. The university has recently expanded to other smaller cities in the state other than Morelia, such as Uruapan, Apatzingán, Ciudad Hidalgo, Lázaro Cárdenas, Coalcoman, Huetamo, Tangancicuaro and Zitacuaro. In 2011, according to the INEGI census, the university had 55,546 regular students.

Other universities in the city include Instituto Tecnológico de Morelia (ITM), Universidad Tecnológica de Morelia (UTM), Instituto Michoacano de Ciencias de la Educación, Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo del Estado de Michoacán (CIDEM), the Morelia Campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Comunicación (IESCAC), Universidad Pedagógica Nacional, Conservatorio de las Rosas, Universidad Vasco de Quiroga, Universidad Latina de America, Universidad La Salle Morelia, Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey- Campus Morelia ITESM, Universidad Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz and many other different private universities.

==Sports==
Morelia was represented by their soccer team, Monarcas Morelia, in the Liga MX.
Monarcas Morelia was founded in 1950 on a field outside the city where a monument to Lázaro Cárdenas is now located. The team&#x27;s original name was Club Deportivo Morelia and was owned by Eucuario Gómez. The club&#x27;s colors are the city&#x27;s flag colors red and yellow because Morelia is known to be the most Spanish city in Mexico. 
The club was nicknamed “Amarillo”(Yellow) During the 1956–57 season, when the club won the right to play in the 1st division in which they played in their first tournament for the Copa México against Club América.
The club descended into the 2nd division again in 1968 and experienced tough times during the early 70s. By the end of the 1973–74 season the team was completely restructured by 32 Morelia Businessmen who acquired the team. After 13 years in the 2nd division, the team finally returned to 1st division play in 1981 and by the mid-1980s was competitive and reaching the Liguilla (playoffs) regularly.

Following many years of playing at Estadio Venustiano Carranza, the completion of Estadio Morelos in 1989 gave the team a new home. In 1996, the team was acquired by TV Azteca and the name Monarcas (Monarchs) Morelia was adopted in 1999 because of the three Spanish Monarchs shown in the flag of Morelia. The team won its first championship during the Invierno 2000 season and by mid-decade, was playing in international competition such as the Copa Libertadores and the Liga de Campeones de la CONCACAF (CONCACAF Champions League). The team&#x27;s latest success came during the 2010 North American SuperLiga tournament, which Monarcas won over the New England Revolution on September the 1st, 2010, at New England.

The team closed the Apertura 2010 tournament of the Primera División de México (Mexico&#x27;s 1st division), failing to make the &quot;liguilla&quot;.

In 2020 it was announced that the franchise would be moving to the city of Mazatlán, Sinaloa, and would be Renamed Mazatlán F.C. Soon after, the municipal government announced that they would have a new team playing in the Liga de Expansión MX (Mexico&#x27;s second division) under the name Atlético Morelia

==Transportation==

Morelia is three or four hours from Mexico City via the Atlacomulco-Maravatío-Morelia highway and is connected by highways to the states of Mexico, Querétaro, Guanajuato and Jalisco. It is connected to the Michoacán coast via highway 200 that passes through Uruapan to the port of Lázaro Cárdenas. General Francisco Mujica International Airport or Morelia International Airport (IATA: MLM, ICAO: MMMM) is an international airport at Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico. The airport handles both domestic and international flights, with connections to Mexico City, Uruapan, Lázaro Cárdenas, Acapulco, Zihuatanejo, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana and several destinations in the United States. The airport is named after a former governor of the state of Michoacán.

==The municipality==

As the municipal seat, Morelia is the governing authority of 423 other communities, almost all of which are small communities of between three and 1,000 people, with 89% of the municipality&#x27;s population of 684,145 people within the city itself. The municipality covers a territory of and borders the municipalities of Tarímbaro, Chucándiro, Huaniqueo, Charo, Tzitzio, Villa Madero, Acuitzio, Lagunillas, Coeneo, Tzintzuntzan and Quiroga.

Much of the municipality is in the Guayangareo Valley between two rivers: the El Grande and the El Chiquito. Guayangareo means &quot;large hill with a flat side.&quot; The municipality&#x27;s territory is rugged and dominated by peaks such as Punhuato, El Zapote and the Otzumatlán mountain range, with the highest peak being Quinceo with an elevation of . The municipality belongs to the Lerma-Santiago river hydraulic region, with the main rivers being the El Grande and the El Chiquito. There are a number of streams including the Zarza and Pitaya. The most important dam here is Cointzio, with other smaller ones being Umécuaro, Laja Caliente and La Mintzita.

Vegetation outside the city varies based on elevation and the type of soil. Mountainous areas are mostly covered in conifers while lower and drier areas have trees such as mesquite. To the south of the city is the Lázaro Cárdenas Forest, which is an ecological reserve. Animal life mostly consists of small mammals, with coyotes being the largest, birds of prey and some reptiles.

The growth of the city of Morelia is having a negative impact on the surrounding forested area. This is particularly problematic in the area north of the city, which belongs to the Lake Cuitzeo basin, and is a main recharge area for the city&#x27;s aquifer. The forested areas around the city are also important for the city&#x27;s air quality and as a breeding place for pollinating insects needed for agriculture. UNAM has been documenting the species in these forests with the aim of getting them declared as biological reserves.

One industrial area is the Ciudad Industrial de Morelia, which mostly houses small and medium-sized enterprises. Some of the products manufactured here include cooking oil, flour, cement, plastics, bottling and candies. Tourism is a rising component of the economy, taking advantage of area&#x27;s colonial heritage, smaller traditional communities, natural areas and archeological zones such as Santa María de Guido in the city, Barranca de los Lobos in Teremendo, Nahuatl Sanctuary and Catrina in Capula. However, it has not been developed sufficiently to be a major contributor. Tourism accounts for the main economic activity in Morelia. Unfortunately, due to Mexico&#x27;s rising crime in drug trafficking within the cartels, this can provide a grave disincentive in the tourism sector for Morelia.

According to Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s report for November 2009, the government of Morelia maintains an adequate development budget, backed by relatively high income and low debt. It is rated on a national scale for Mexico as A+. The economy is projected to be stable with the government keeping control of expenses.

<text>An altarpiece is a painting or sculpture, including relief, of religious subject matter made for placing at the back of or behind the altar of a Christian church. Though most commonly used for a single work of art such as a painting or sculpture, or a set of them, the word can also be used of the whole ensemble behind an altar, otherwise known as a reredos, including what is often an elaborate frame for the central image or images. Altarpieces were one of the most important products of Christian art especially from the late Middle Ages to the era of Baroque painting.
The word altarpiece, used for paintings, usually means a framed work of panel painting on wood, or later on canvas. In the Middle Ages they were generally the largest genre for these formats. Murals in fresco tend to cover larger surfaces. The largest painted altarpieces developed complicated structures, especially winged altarpieces with hinged side wings that folded in to cover the main image, and were painted on the reverse with different simpler images. Often this was the normal view shown in the church, except for Sundays and feast days, when the wings were opened to display the main image. At other times visitors could usually see this by paying the sacristan. 

Altarpieces with many small framed panels are called polyptychs; triptychs have a main panel, and two side ones. Diptychs, with only two equally sized panels, were usually smaller portable pieces for individuals. The predella is a row of much smaller scenes running below the main panel; often these showed narrative scenes related to the subject of the main image. They were only properly visible from close up, but the extra height allowed the main panels above to be clearly seen by the congregation, and any shutters to be opened and closed with less disturbance to other items on the altar. 

Many altarpieces have now been removed from their church settings, and often from their elaborate sculpted frameworks, and are displayed as more simply framed paintings in museums and elsewhere.

==History==
===Origins and early development===
In the first several centuries of large Christian churches being built, the altar tended to be further forward (towards the congregation) in the sanctuary than in the later Middles Ages (a position to which it returned in the 20th century) and a large altarpiece would often have blocked the view of a bishop&#x27;s throne and other celebrants, so decoration was concentrated on other places, with antependiums or altar frontals, or the surrounding walls.

Altarpieces seem to have begun to be used during the 11th century, with the possible exception of a few earlier examples. The reasons and forces that led to the development of altarpieces are not generally agreed upon. The habit of placing decorated reliquaries of saints on or behind the altar, as well as the tradition of decorating the front of the altar with sculptures or textiles, preceded the first altarpieces. In the Romanesque period, painted altar frontals on panel seem to have been a common alternative location for paintings. Few survive, though small Catalonian churches preserved several, many now in the Museu Nacional d&#x27;Art de Catalunya in Barcelona. The development of altarpieces may have begun at the altars of side chapels, typically engaged with the wall behind, rather than at freestanding main altars.

Many early altarpieces were relatively simple compositions in the form of a rectangular panel decorated with series of saints in rows, with a central, more pronounced figure such as a depiction of Mary or Christ. An elaborate example of such an early altarpiece is the metal and enamel Pala d&#x27;Oro in Venice, extended in the 12th century from an earlier altar frontal. The appearance and development of these first altarpieces marked an important turning point both in the history of Christian art as well as Christian religious practice. It was considered a &quot;significant development&quot; because of its impact on the &quot;nature and function of the Christian image...the autonomous image now assumed a legitimate position at the centre of Christian worship&quot;.

===The emergence of panel painting===
Painted panel altars emerged in Italy during the 13th century, and until the Renaissance were generally the largest and most significant type of panel painting. In the 13th century, it was not uncommon to find frescoed or mural altarpieces in Italy; mural paintings behind the altar served as visual complements for the liturgy. These altarpieces were influenced by Byzantine art, notably icons, which reached Western Europe in greater numbers following the conquest of Constantinople in 1204. During this time, altarpieces occasionally began to be decorated with an outer, sculptured or gabled structure with the purpose of providing a frame for individual parts of the altarpiece. Vigoroso da Siena&#x27;s altarpiece from 1291 &quot;(pictured)&quot; is an example. This treatment of the altarpiece would eventually pave the way for the emergence, in the 14th century, of the polyptych.

The sculpted elements in the emerging polyptychs often took inspiration from contemporary Gothic architecture. In Italy, they were still typically executed in wood and painted, while in northern Europe altarpieces were often made of stone.

In the early 14th century, the winged altarpiece emerged in Germany, the Low Countries, Scandinavia, the Baltic region and the Catholic parts of Eastern Europe. They spread to France, but remained rare in Italy. By hinging the outer panels to the central panel and painting them on both sides, the subject could be regulated by opening or closing the wings. The pictures could thus be changed depending on liturgical demands. The earliest often displayed sculptures on the inner panels (i.e., displayed when open) and paintings on the back of the wings (displayed when closed). With the advent of winged altarpieces, a shift in imagery also occurred. Instead of being centred on a single holy figure, altarpieces began to portray more complex narratives linked to the concept of salvation.

===Late Middle Ages===
As the Middle Ages progressed, altarpieces began to be commissioned more frequently. In Northern Europe, initially Lübeck and later Antwerp would develop into veritable export centres for the production of altarpieces, exporting to Scandinavia, Spain and northern France. By the 15th century, altarpieces were often commissioned not only by churches but also by individuals, families, guilds and confraternities. The 15th century saw the birth of Early Netherlandish painting in the Low Countries; henceforth panel painting would dominate altarpiece production in the area. In Germany, sculpted wooden altarpieces were instead often preferred, for example the Veit Stoss altarpiece in Kraków (completed 1489), while in England there was a 15th-century industry producing relatively cheap painted altarpiece kits in Nottingham alabaster, many of which were exported, the frame being added at the destination. 

In England, as well as in France, stone retables enjoyed general popularity. In Italy both stone retables and wooden polyptychs were common, with individual painted panels and often (notably in Venice and Bologna) with complex framing in the form of architectural compositions. In Spain, altarpieces developed in a highly original fashion into often very large, architecturally influenced reredos, sometimes as tall as the church in which it was housed.

===Renaissance and Reformation===

The 15th century also saw a development of the composition of Italian altarpieces where the polyptych was gradually abandoned in favour of single-panel, painted altarpieces. In Italy, the &quot;sacra conversazione&quot; developed, a group usually centred on the Virgin and Child, flanked by a group of saints usually chosen to represent the patron saints of the church, city, religious order or donors. These became increasingly informal in pose, and some may have been initially displayed in the donor&#x27;s house, then bequeathed to a church as a memorial. They represented the same components as many altarpieces with framed compartments, but with a single pictorial space.

Other types of Italian composition also moved towards having a single large scene, sometimes called a &quot;pala&quot; (Italian for &quot;panel&quot;), often dispensing with the predella. Rather than static figures, narrative scenes from the lives of the main figures grew in popularity; this was to become the dominant style for large altarpieces over the next centuries. Originally mostly horizontal (&quot;landscape&quot;) in format, they increasingly used vertical (&quot;portrait&quot;) formats. Some were as much as 4 metres tall, and concentrated on a single dramatic action. This much height typically required a composition with an &quot;in aria&quot; group to fill the upper part of the picture space, as in Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Transfiguration&quot; (now Vatican), though &quot;The Raising of Lazarus&quot; by Sebastiano del Piombo (now London) is almost as tall, using only a landscape at the top.

In Italy, during the Renaissance, free-standing groups of sculpture also began to feature as altarpieces. The most famous example is the &quot;Pietà&quot; by Michelangelo, originally placed as the altarpiece in a side chapel of Old St Peter&#x27;s.
In the north of Europe, the Protestant Reformation from the early 16th century onwards led to a swift decline in the number of altarpieces produced in the parts of Europe affected. Outbursts of iconoclasm locally led to the destruction of many altarpieces. As an example, during the burning of the Antwerp Cathedral in the course of the Reformation in 1533, more than fifty altarpieces were destroyed. The Reformation initially persisted with the creation of new some altarpieces reflecting its doctrines, sometimes using portraits of Lutheran leaders for figures such as apostles. The Protestant range of subjects contracted; traditional saints were no longer shown, and the Last Supper was a popular scene. Lucas Cranach the Elder&#x27;s Wittenberg Altarpiece of 1547 is a leading example, with the side panels showing scenes of the sacraments with a modern setting, and the single predella scene Martin Luther preaching; the reverses are also painted.

But Calvinism opposed all large public religious images such as altarpieces, and by about 1560 production of Protestant ones had mostly ceased. The Reformation regarded the Word of God – that is, the gospel – as central to Christendom, and Protestant altarpieces were often painted biblical text passages, increasingly at the expense of any pictures. With time, Protestant though gave birth to the so-called pulpit altar (&quot;Kanzelaltar&quot; in German), in which the altarpiece and the pulpit were combined, making the altarpiece a literal abode for the Word of God.
If anything, the Protestant destruction stimulated the creation of more and larger altarpieces in Catholic Europe. Titian produced a number of ones with very large single scenes, mostly now on canvas. Among the most influential were his &quot;Assumption&quot; in the Frari Church (1518, still on panel, 690 cm × 360 cm (270 in × 140 in)), the &quot;Pesaro Madonna&quot; in the same church (1526, now on canvas), &quot;Killing of Saint Peter Martyr&quot; (1529, now lost but known from prints and copies).

===Baroque===
In the Baroque period, the single scene became standard, sometimes incorporated in an elaborate carved frame. Usually there was no reverse view, as altarpieces were fixed to a wall in side chapels, or a built-up backing for main altars in older churches where there were other chapels behind the main altar. Predellas and closing side panels became rare, though Rubens&#x27;s &quot;Elevation of the Cross&quot; (1611) has two hinged side-wings, with saints on their other sides, a rather conservative format, in a medieval church.

Increasingly, the size and shape of altarpieces became dictated by the overall design and decoration of the church, which the artist was required to fit in with. If funds allowed several altarpieces were commissioned for Baroque churches when they were first built or re-fitted, for the main and side-altars, giving the whole interior a consistent style. Medieval churches had mostly acquired altarpieces gradually over time, from different donors.

Sculptural altarpieces, or designs integrating painting with sculpture, became more common. Examples by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598–1680), the leading Baroque sculptor of his day, include his &quot;Ecstasy of Saint Teresa&quot; in Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome, and his sculpted &quot;concetto&quot; around the painting by Guillaume Courtois in Sant&#x27;Andrea al Quirinale. Both of these were essentially figures in the round, but Alessandro Algardi&#x27;s &quot;Pope Leo the Great repelling Attila&quot; in St Peter&#x27;s Basilica is a &quot;huge&quot; relief with a full scene with over life-size figures. German Baroque and Rococo altarpieces also revived the local taste for sculpture, with the figures in many examples (usually in stucco) spreading around the whole upper level of the church.

===Later developments===
While many altarpieces remain today, the majority have been lost. In 1520, there were 2,000 winged altarpieces in the Austrian state of Tyrol alone; scholars estimate that before World War II, there were around 3,000 altarpieces in the entire territory of Nazi Germany. Many were lost during the Reformation (in the north of Europe) or replaced with Baroque altarpieces during the Counter-Reformation (in the southern part of Europe), or else were discarded during the Enlightenment or replaced with Neo-Gothic altarpieces during the 19th century (particularly in the United Kingdom). In the German-speaking part of Europe, there is only one altarpiece remaining that was made for the high altar of a cathedral (in Chur Cathedral in Switzerland). In the 18th century, altarpieces like Piero della Francesca&#x27;s &quot;Saint Augustine Altarpiece&quot; were often disassembled and seen as independent artworks. The different panels of the polyptych of St Augustine are thus today spread out among several different art museums. Double-sided wing panels were often sawn apart by dealers or collectors, to give two paintings for hanging.

==Types of altarpieces==
Altarpieces have never been made compulsory in the Catholic Church, nor their usage and treatment formalised, apart from some church authorities laying down guidelines on subject-matter and style after the 16th-century Council of Trent; therefore their appearance can vary significantly. Occasionally, the demarcation between what constitutes the altarpiece and what constitutes other forms of decoration can be unclear. Altarpieces can still broadly be divided into two types, the &quot;reredos&quot;, which signifies a large and often complex wooden or stone altarpiece, and the &quot;retable&quot;, an altarpiece with panels either painted or with reliefs. Retables are placed directly on the altar or on a surface behind it; a &quot;reredos&quot; typically rises from the floor.

Older retable-type altarpieces are often made up of two or more separate wood panels, sometimes with framed divisions, as in medieval examples, but later with the joins between panels invisible under the painted surface (as with some works by Rubens. They may also display reliefs or sculpture in the round, either polychrome or un-painted. It is then called a diptych, triptych or polyptych for two, three, and multiple panels respectively. In the 13th century, each panel was usually surmounted with a pinnacle, but during the Renaissance, single-panel &quot;pala&quot; altarpieces became the norm. In both cases, the supporting plinth (&quot;predella&quot;) often featured supplementary and related paintings.

The Altarpiece of Pellegrino II of about 1200 (in Cividale, Italy) is a rare survival of a large partly-gilded silver relief altarpiece. Such pieces may have been more common, but later melted down for the metal.

At least in the 15th century, altarpieces for main or high altars were required by canon law to be free-standing, allowing passage behind them, while those for side chapels were often attached to, or painted, the wall behind. 

If the altar stands free in the choir, such that visitors can pass behind the main altar, both sides of the altarpiece can be covered with painting. The screen, retable or reredos are commonly decorated. Groups of statuary can also be placed &quot;on&quot; an altar. A single church can furthermore house several altarpieces on side-altars in chapels. Sometimes the altarpiece is set on the altar itself and sometimes in front of it.

Much smaller private altarpieces, often portable, were made for wealthy individuals to use at home, often as folding diptychs or triptychs for safe transport. In the Middle Ages, very small luxury diptychs or triptychs carved in ivory or other materials were popular.

Matters evolved differently in Eastern Orthodoxy, where the iconostasis developed as a wide screen composed of large icons, placed in front of the altar, with doors through it, and running right across the sanctuary.

<text>Guerrero, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Guerrero, is one of the 32 states that compose the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 81 municipalities. The state has a population of about 3.5 million people. It is located in southwest Mexico and is bordered by the states of Michoacán to the north and west, the State of Mexico and Morelos to the north, Puebla to the northeast and Oaxaca to the east. In addition to the capital city, Chilpancingo and the largest city Acapulco, other cities in Guerrero include Petatlán, Ciudad Altamirano, Taxco, Iguala, Ixtapa, and Zihuatanejo. Today, it is home to a number of indigenous communities, including the Nahuas, Mixtecs, Tlapanecs, Amuzgos, and formerly Cuitlatecs. It is also home to communities of Afro-Mexicans in the Costa Chica region.

The state was named after Vicente Guerrero, one of the most prominent leaders in the Mexican War of Independence and the second President of Mexico. It is the only Mexican state named after a president. The modern entity did not exist until 1849, when it was carved out of territories from the states of Mexico, Puebla, and Michoacán.

Geographically, the state is mountainous and rugged with flat areas limited to small mesas and the Pacific coastline. This coastline has been important economically for the area, first as the port of Acapulco in colonial and post-Independence era and today for the tourist destinations of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa. Tourism is the single most important economic factor of the state and Acapulco&#x27;s tourism is important to the nation&#x27;s economy as a whole. Agriculture and mining are also important to the state&#x27;s economy, with production of crops like bananas, coffee, rice, corn, and sugarcane, as well as mined copper, silver, and gold. However, other sources of employment are scarce in the state, which has caused its ranking as number one in the emigration of workers to the United States.

==History==

===Prehistoric and Pre-Columbian periods===

The first humans in the state&#x27;s territory were nomadic hunter-gatherers who left evidence of their existence in various caves starting about 20,000 years ago. Until about 8,000 years ago, climatic conditions better favored human habitation than those today; however, sedentary human habitation happened around this time in the mountainous areas with more moisture, and better soil for agriculture. After that, settlements appeared near the coast because of fishing. At these sites, evidence of weaving, ceramics, basketry and other crafts have been found. Around this time, a grain called teocintle, or the forerunner to corn, became the staple of the diet.

There is debate as to whether the earliest civilizations here were Olmecs, who migrated to this region or native peoples who were heavily influenced by the Olmecs, especially in the Balsas River area. Olmec influences can be seen in cave paintings such as those found in Juxtlahuaca and Cacahuaziziqui as well as stone tools and jade jewelry from the time period.

Recent evidence indicates that ancient Guerrero cultures may have influenced the early development of the Olmecs.

Eventually, the peoples of the Mexcala River area developed their own distinctive culture, called Mezcala or Mexcala. It is characterized by its own sculpture and ceramics, distinguished by its simplicity. Olmec influence remained with this culture, especially evident in the grouping of villages, construction of ceremonial centers and a government dominated by priests. Later, the culture assimilated aspects of the Teotihuacan model, which included the Mesoamerican ballgame .

Later migrations to the area brought ethnicities such as the Purépecha, Mixtecs, Maya and Zapotecs who left traces on the local cultures as they established commercial centers around the seventh century. In the 8th century, Toltec influence was felt as they traveled the many trade routes through here in search of tropical bird plumage and amate paper. From the 12th century to the 15th, the various peoples of the state were influence by the Chichimecas, culminating in Aztec domination by the 15th century.

In the 11th century, new migrations entered the area from the north, which included the Nahuas, who occupied what is now the center of the state, and the Purépecha who took over the west. The Nahuas established themselves in Zacatula, Atoyac de Álvarez and Tlacotepec, later conquering the areas occupied by the and Matlatzincas.

By the 15th century, the territory of the modern state of Guerrero was inhabited by a number of peoples, none of whom had major cities or population centers. The most important of these peoples were the Purépecha, Cuitlatecs, Ocuiltecs and Matlatzincas in the Tierra Caliente, the Chontales, Mazatlecos and Tlahuicas in the Sierra del Norte, the Coixcas and Tepoztecos in the Central Valleys, the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs in the La Montaña, the Jopis (Tlapanecos), Mixtecos and Amuzgos on the Costa Chica and Tolimecas, Chumbias, Pantecas and Cuitlatecas on the Costa Grande. Most of these lived in smaller dominions with moderate social stratification. One distinctive feature of the peoples of this was the use of cotton garments.

The Aztecs began making incursions in the Guerrero area as early as 1414 under Chimalpopoca as part of the conquest of the Toluca Valley. Incursions into the Tierra Caliente came around 1433 under Itzcoatl who attacked the Cuitlatecos settled between the Teloloapan and Cocula Rivers. By 1440, the Aztec Empire controlled the north of the state, or the La Montaña area. Attempts to take the Costa Chica area began in 1452 against the Yopis, which failed. Various battles would be fought between 1452 and 1511 before most of the rest of the state became Aztec tributary provinces. The modern state of Guerrero comprised seven Aztec provinces.

===Colonial period===
During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the last Aztec emperor, Cuauhtémoc (who was the son of a Chontal princess and Ahuizotl), came from Ixcateopan de Cuauhtémoc. After the fall of Tenochtitlan, there was little resistance by the peoples of the Guerrero area to the Spanish and a number of them, such as the Amuzgos, actively sided with the Europeans. In 1521, Rodrigo de Castañeda entered the Taxco area, while Gonzalo de Sandoval marched on the Chontal region, the Sierra del Norte, the Iguala valley and later the Costa Chica. Juan Rodriguz de Villafuerte took the Costa Grande area.

After the Spanish Conquest, the territory was part of the &quot;audencia&quot; or &quot;court of royal law for indigenous peoples&quot; called México, which initially consisted of the lands of the former Aztec Empire, which was then diminished somewhat when it became a province of New Spain. The Guerrero area was attractive to the Spanish mostly for its coast. The first Spanish Pacific port was at Zihuatanejo, used for trade, fishing and pearls. Another important area for the Spanish was Taxco for its minerals. The lands were divided into 76 encomiendas given to the conquistadors to exploit and &quot;civilize&quot; the mines, farmlands, forest and native peoples. Evangelization efforts were undertaken by the Augustinians in the Central Valleys, La Montaña and Tierra Caliente regions while the Franciscans took the northern areas, the Costa Grande and Acapulco.

Much of the population decline occurred in the first half of the 16th century when diseases brought by the Europeans, as well as brutal exploitation, killed many natives. This was particularly true in the Costa Chica region, which would lead to the importation of African slaves to the area. During this time indigenous political bodies called &quot;pueblos&quot; or &quot;Indian Republics&quot; arose, which were local entities that represented the Indians of that area before Spanish authorities. They are credited with being one of the forerunners of the current municipality system in the state. At their height, there were 213 such pueblos in the Guerrero territory.

During the colonial period, Acapulco became the main western port for New Spain, connecting this part of the Spanish empire to Asia. The Manila galleon came here each year, bringing silks and other merchandise from China, India and other Asian areas. Also on board were thousands of Asian slaves. These slaves and other Asian individuals that migrated of their own will during the colonial period form the basis of what is known as the &quot;cuarta raíz&quot; of Mexico.

On January 25, 1614, a delegation led by samurai Hasekura Tsunenaga, which included over one hundred Japanese Christians as well as twenty-two samurai under the shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu, arrived from Japan to Acapulco as part of a mission to form closer relations with Catholic Europe. A fight soon broke out in which a Japanese samurai stabbed a Spanish colonial soldier. This was witnessed and recorded by historian Chimalpahin, who was descended from an Aztec nobleman. Some of Tsunenaga&#x27;s delegation would stay and marry with the locals.

By the second half of the 18th century, few indigenous people survived and exploitation of those that were left took on more varied forms in indentured servitude. Acapulco became the most important city in the area, and its mayor governed much of Guerrero&#x27;s territory. This territory then belonged into three intendencias or alcaldias–Puebla, Mexico and Valladolid, regions managed by a superintendent intended to root out corruption–and would remain so until the early Independence period.

===Independence and the later nineteenth century===

Peoples of the territory of Guerrero immediately supported the cause of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla which would culminate with the Independence of Mexico. During the first part of the Mexican War of Independence, José María Morelos fought on the side of Miguel Hidalgo in the southern part of Mexico, including the Acapulco area and the Costa Grande. Filipino-Mexicans led by Isidoro Montes de Oca, who were also against Spanish colonization, assisted in the general uprising. However, the insurgents were never able to take the port. They were able to take control of territories in the center of the state. Morelos took Chilpancingo and set up the Congress of Anáhuac, which would publish the document &quot;Sentimentos de la Nación&quot; on 6 November 1813. The Congress of Anáhuac also approved the Act of Independence written by Carlos María Bustamante. Later, the Mexican flag was designed and first sewn in Iguala, after Agustín de Iturbide and Vicente Guerrero joined forces under the Plan of Iguala to end the war in 1821.

The first government of an independent Mexico divided the country into twelve departments. The territory of the modern state of Guerrero was divided among the departments of Mexico, Puebla, Michoacán, and Oaxaca. The 1824 Constitution made these entities states.

In 1823, Nicolás Bravo and Vicente Guerrero petitioned for the creation of a &quot;South State&quot; (Estado del Sur), encompassing the lands that Guerrero had military control over during the war, but without success. However, the federal government did recognize a military district centered on Chilpancingo which Guerrero headed until he became President of Mexico in 1824.

Much of the country struggled between its liberal (federalist) and conservative (centralist) factions in the first half of the 19th century. In one of these battles, Vicente Guerrero was captured and executed in Oaxaca in 1831. With conservatives in charge, Nicolas Bravo proposed in 1836 a South Department with its capital in Chilpancingo, including the provinces of Acapulco, Chilapa, Tlapa and Taxco. In 1841, representatives from 42 communities in the area, called the &quot;amigos del sur,&quot; pushed to have a &quot;Acapulco Department&quot; created, but it was rejected by Antonio López de Santa Anna.

There were other political and military reorganizations in the area during the 1840s. In 1847, Nicolas Bravo and Juan Álvarez proposed creating a separate entity for the Acapulco, Chilapa and Taxco areas, but the Mexican–American War intervened. After the war, the states of Puebla, Mexico and Michoacán were persuaded to cede territory for a new entity.

In 1849, President José Joaquín de Herrera decreed the establishment of the state of Guerrero, with Juan Álvarez as its first governor. Tixtla was declared the first capital. The state was created from the districts of Acapulco, Chilapa and Taxco from the State of Mexico, Tlapa from Puebla and the municipality of Coyuca from the state of Michoacán. The capital would later be moved to Chilpancingo in 1870.

In this state, Juan Álvarez rebelled against the government of Ignacio Comonfort and declared the Plan of Ayutla in 1854. However, this rebellion was quelled by the federal government. More uprisings would ensue after the adoption of the 1857 Constitution. These uprisings were part of the ongoing struggle between liberals and conservatives in the country. The state of Guerrero was a mostly conservative area of the country, and it opposed both the 1857 Constitution and the 1859 Reform Laws. Intense battle between liberal and conservative elements would continue through most of the rest of the 19th century.

For most of the period of President Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s regime (1876–1911), the state was in relative peace, electing nine governors, although only two of these were Guerrero natives. The economy became concentrated in the hands of a few landholders, military people and others. While the era was relatively prosperous, very little of this benefit reached the common people. Laws were passed and infrastructure in the state was created to benefit the major players of the economy. In addition, indigenous people were forced from the north to the south to work, such as the Kickapoos who were forced to work in the haciendas of the Costa Chica. Some of the first factories built in the state were constructed during this period. Acapulco was connected to Mexico City by rail in the 1890s. Despite the economic development, many people remained without work at the very end of the 19th century as mining and cotton farming waned.

===Mexican Revolution to the present===

Some of the first uprisings against Diaz occurred in the state. In 1873 in the La Montaña region, Pascual Claudio pronounced the Plan de Xochihuahuetlan, with the backing of the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs of the state and pushed for the socialization of land. The revolt was put down one year later. In 1876, field workers in various regions rebelled against taxes, usurpation of lands and oppression against political prisoners. Another revolt occurred in 1887 in the Tlapa regions, led by Silverio Leon. In 1891, a movement led by José Cuevas has a messianic character to it and worked to bring down the Diaz government. In this case, federal control over much of Guerrero was weakened. In the 1900s, a number of intellectuals, including Eusebio S. Almonte (great grandson of Morelos) rebelled politically against the state and federal governments. The revolt was put down by Victoriano Huerta.

A number of other rebellions broke out in the state against the Diaz government until the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. From that point, many of the local rebels became affiliated with the Zapatistas.

In 1911, after Díaz resigned, the last of his supporting troops in Guerrero surrendered in Acapulco. Rebels loyal to Francisco I. Madero chose Francisco Figueroa as the governor and established Guerrero&#x27;s capital in Acapulco. While Madero was initially popular in Guerrero, he soon lost standing for failure to return lands which were claimed by various indigenous and rural farm groups. From this point, the Zapatistas turned on the Madero government with the next phase of the revolution breaking out in Guerrero and other states. The Zapatistas soon had control of the central valley and strategic positions in the north of the state. When Victoriano Huerta took control of the country, the Zapatistas in Guerrero joined forces with those loyal to Venustiano Carranza, eventually controlling almost all of the state by 1914. During this time lands were redistributed. However, after Huerta resigned and Carranza assumed the presidency, the Zapatistas in Guerrero opposed him as well. Carranza offered the position of governor of Guerrero to Julian Blanco in 1915 but he was killed in an ambush a year later. From this point, there were battles between the Zapatistas and forces loyal to Carranza. This ended in 1919, when Emiliano Zapata died and his movement split.

Various battles among the factions of the Mexican Revolution had skirmishes in the state until the war was finally over in 1920. The Zapatistas, although fragmented, were recognized as a political force in Guerrero with many Zapatistas receiving political and military positions. This included Rodolfo Neri as governor, who initiated the Agrarian Reform in 1921, organized workers&#x27; unions and made education mandatory.

Although the Revolution was over, there were still factional struggles among unions, local strongmen, foreign interests and rural farm organizations over land, education and politics. These would flare up into localized armed rebellions such as the one led by Romulo Figueroa in 1923 and federal attempts to recuperate lands in 1927. In addition, battles related to the Cristero War were fought in Guerrero as well. There were a number of strikes and other political actions by unions in the 1930s. Government intervention brought better agricultural production techniques as well as new crops such as coconut groves, sesame seed and coffee. Some industries were introduced as well, especially in Iguala and Chilpancingo. Most of these are related to food processing, mining and energy production.

From the 1930s, to the present, the making of crafts and tourism have played a significant role in the economy. In Taxco, silver mining and silversmithing made a comeback due to the efforts of William Spratling. Tourism is mostly centered on the coastal communities of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and the tourist resort of Ixtapa. Acapulco became the first major tourist attraction for the state in the 1950s, when Hollywood stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Eddie Fisher, Brigitte Bardot and others made it fashionable. During the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel there. Zihuatanejo, with the nearby resort area of Ixtapa, were developed by the federal government in the 1970s and 1980s to increase tourism to the area.

In 2012, some teachers from rural areas, including Guerrero, opposed federal regulations which prevented them from automatic lifetime tenure, the ability to sell or will their jobs, and the teaching of either English or computer skills. In September 2014, the municipality of Iguala was the site of a mass kidnapping of 43 students that drew national and international attention.

==Demographics==

The state is home to four indigenous ethnic groups, most of whom live in rugged, isolated mountain areas such as Ixcateopan, Santa María Oapan, Ameyaltepec, Chilapa de Álvarez, Malinaltepec, Tlapa de Comonfort, Metlatonoc, Zapotitlan Tablas and Xochistlahuaca and Xilitla. Some of these groups include the Mixtecs, Nahuas, Amuzgos and Tlapanecos, and over 20 indigenous languages are spoken. The most common languages are Nahuatl (38.9%), Mixtec (27%), Tlapanec (21.9%) and Amuzgo (7.9%). The Cuitlatec culture was also native to the western part of the state, but their language and identity went extinct in the 1960s. Only 29% of those who speak an indigenous language also speak Spanish.

One distinctive group in the state is the Amuzgo people, who are concentrated in the south, near the Oaxacan border in municipalities such as Xochistlahuaca. This group is known for its handwoven textiles done on backstrap looms with many pieces recognized by the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes. Cualac is noted for its machetes which have blades decorated by etching miniature landscapes. Temalacacingo and Acapetlahuaya produce gourd items, toys and small lacquered items. Olinalá has been an important producer of lacquer since pre-Hispanic times.

Another important group is the “afromexicanos” or Afro-Mexicans who are concentrated in the Costa Chica region. This group is found in Guerrero and the Costa Chica area of Oaxaca. This group has been relatively isolated from the rest of Mexico, with little modernization or formal education. To this day, there are many who have no birth certificates or know how to read or write. Much of the history of these people is preserved in oral tradition. Historically, afromexicanos have been discriminated against and marginalized. Even among these people today, the concept of being “negro” is considered bad and a number take to skin-lightening methods. The musical style associated with the group is “Chilena” which became popular outside of Guerrero and Oaxaca after the 1960s. One of these songs, “Soy negro de la Costa…,” has been preserved by CONACULTA and INAH as part of Mexico&#x27;s cultural heritage. A major change for this community came with the building of the highway connecting Acapulco with Pinotepa Nacional and Puerto Escondido, which opened it up to the outside world. This allowed the shipping of goods and influx of people. The increase in people and contacts led to the building of schools. According to the 2020 Census, 8.58% of Guerrero&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent, which is the highest percentage of any state in Mexico.

A genetic study in 2018 has also revealed that around one-third of the population of Guerrero have 10% Filipino ancestry. Like the culturally surviving afromexicanos, most were brought to Mexico by the trans-Pacific slave trade via the Manila galleons. The classification of Filipinos as &quot;chinos&quot; upon arrival in Mexico during the 16th and 17th centuries has led to their modern conflation with later 19th century Chinese immigrants.

==Culture==
The state does not have a tradition of painting and other visual arts aside from amate paper work but, recently, there has been a movement to promote more classical oils and other works, with recent generations of painters from the state and galleries opening to promote their work. Some of these artists include Casiano García, Ian Malaj, Leonel Maciel, Miguel Ángel Sotelo, Gerzaín Vargas and Hugo Zúñiga.

The literary arts have a longer tradition, at least as far back as the 17th century. The best-known writer from the state hailed from Taxco, playwright Juan Ruiz de Alarcón. He is considered to be one of the most notable writers from the Siglo de Oro of Spanish literature. Another notable writer from the state is Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, although he is better known for his role in the defeat of Emperor Maximilian I and as a politician than as a writer. Other writers from the state over the centuries include Celedonio Serrano, Herminio Chávez, Juan Sánchez Andraka and Andrés Acosta.

The state has a long history of folk music, which has been the basis of much of the state&#x27;s modern compositions as well. Because of the different ethnicities, traditions and customs vary from region to region. In the coastal lowlands, music such as “son” is most often heard and dances such as jarabes. The culture of the Costa Chica region of Guerrero is centered on the municipality of Tixtla. Dances performed here include the Arranca Zacete, Jarabes, Palomo or Chilena and the Fandango. Most of these are accompanied by bands playing wind instruments. Another type of music which is endemic to the state is called &quot;calentana&quot;, which comes from an area called the Tierra Caliente. Tixtleca music comes from the town of Tixtla in the center of the state. Guerrero&#x27;s best known composer is Margarito Damián Vargas, who was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was only 37 years old when he died, but he had written more than 200 musical works including &quot;Ondas del Pacífico,&quot; &quot;Me delirio,&quot; &quot;Adiós a Acapulco,&quot; and &quot;Dolores,&quot; which have been performed by orchestras and popular singers. Other musicians include José Agustín Ramírez Altamirano, Zacarías Salmerón Daza and Joan Sebastian. As well, another singer from Guerrero, Aida Pierce, became better known as an actress and comedian.

Some interesting regional customs in Guerrero include the burning of “malo” (evil) on 29 September made with dried flowers. Afterward, protective crosses of fresh flowers are placed on doors of homes. Other customs are the singing of “Papaquis” instead of “Las Mañanitas” in Tixtla, the weddings of the Costa Grande where guests pay for their own food, the tiger fight dance in Zitlala and Tixtla and eating pozole on Thursdays in Chilpancingo.

Cuisine in the state is most strongly influenced by the indigenous, the Spanish and, to some extent, the French. Corn, chili pepper, beans and meat are indigenous ingredients. Indigenous preparations include the various moles (red, green, yellow and others), chalupas, totopos, atole, pozole and many other dishes. Spanish contributions include wheat, leavened bread (including “chilpancingueñas&quot;) and dairy products. French influence comes from the French occupation of the country in the 19th century as well as French monks who had been in the area of Chilapa earlier. Regional dishes include mole de jumil (made from a particular type of native beetle) in Taxco, bean tamales in Tepecuacuilco, quail dishes in Iguala and seafood “cuatete” in the Costa Chica area. A number of areas in the state produce mezcal and wine is made in the Huitzuco area. Pozole blanco is widely and traditionally consumed on Thursdays and Saturdays in the state.

The state&#x27;s ethnic groups are known for their unique musical styles as well as regional dances. The best known dance is the Danza de los Tlacoloteros. This originated in the Central Valleys region, and its theme is agriculture. The owners of “tlacololes” (cornfields) are called “tlacololoeros.” The basic premise is that these tlacololoeros chase away malevolent spirits from the crops, which are represented by naguals or fierce tigers. The dance has 15 characters. It is most often performed in places such as Chichuihualco, Taxco, Chilpancingo, Iguala and Atlixtac. Another dance that feature tigers is the Danza del Tecuano, where the animals stalk characters. This one is most often performed in Tuxpan, Ciudad Altamirano and Huitzuco. Other dances performed in the state include the Danza de los Diablos, the Danza de los Manueles, the Danza de los Gachupines, the Danza de los Siete Vicios, the Danza de los Pescados, the Danza de los Machos, the Danza de los Moros, the Danza de los Maizos, the Danza de los Zopilotes, the Danza de los Tejoneros and the Danza del Palomo de Guerrero.

==Tourism==

===Triangle of the Sun===

Almost all of Guerrero&#x27;s tourism is concentrated among the municipalities of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Taxco, which the state promotes as the “Triángulo del Sol” (Triangle of the Sun). Acapulco is by far the most important of the three. In 2008, the state attracted 272.8 million dollars of private investment into the tourism sector of the economy, with most of it invested in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa. In addition, federal tourism agencies invested another 180 million pesos that year, both for infrastructure and promotion. The State Department of the United States has issued travel advisories for the state, especially Acapulco, due to drug trafficking, but safety concerns have been dismissed by local authorities.

Acapulco is one of Mexico&#x27;s oldest and most well-known beach resorts, which came into prominence by the 1950s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco is still famous for its nightlife and still attracts many vacationers, although most are now from Mexico itself. Zihuatanejo is the fourth-largest city in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is northwest of Acapulco. This town has been developed as a tourist attraction, paired along with the modern tourist resort of Ixtapa, 5 km away. However, Zihuatanejo keeps its traditional town feel. Taxco was one of the primary mining areas during the colonial period. It has narrow winding streets with no sidewalks, due to being built in a narrow ridge on the side of a mountain. The town was declared a national monument by Mexico in 1990, with numerous historical buildings dating from the 17th to 19th centuries.

===Archeological sites===
Most of Guerrero&#x27;s pre-Hispanic history is known through archeology. The state has 1,705 registered archeological sites, with seven officially open to the public. These include La Organera-Xochipala, Palma Sola, Teopantecuanitlán and Cuetlajuchitlán. La Organera-Xochipala is the best known of Guerrero&#x27;s archeological sites because of its monumental architecture. The site has seven states of development with six patios, and thirty two structures. The site covers and is located in the community of Xochilapa in the municipality of Eduardo Neri or Zumpango del Río, which is a mountains and semi-arid region of the state. It was occupied from 650 CE to 1000 CE The tombs are the most notable constructions here and feature a number of Mayan “false arches.” .

Palma Sola is a site on the south side of El Veladero in Acapulco. This site does not have any structure but rather it is important for 18 rocks with petroglyphs with images of humans, plants and animals. There are also figures which look to be calendar like and geographic in function.

Teopantecuanitlan is the most important Olmec era site in Guerrero. Its calculated to extend over but the most important buildings cover . It was discovered in 1983 as it was being sacked. It is estimated to have been inhabited from between 1000 and 500 BCE. It is located in the Valley of Copalillo where the Amacuzas and Mezcala (Balsas) Rivers converge. Cuetlajuchitlan was discovered accidentally during the construction of the Cuernavaca, Acapulco highway. To preserve the site, the Los Querendes Tunnel was built underneath it. It is calculated to extend but only have been explored. It was principally occupied between 200 BCE and 200 CE. It is identified as being with the Mezcala culture. The site stands out as an early example of a planned city which extends from the intersection two main roads.

Other, smaller sites include Ixcateopan, Los Tepoltzis and Huamuxtitlan. Pueblo Viejo is located on the side of the El Tamarindo mountain just west of the city of Iguala. This site has an extension of and is divided in two parts due to a ravine that runs through it. The exact number of structures here is not known because the site has not been fully explored. The site of Ixcateopan is located in the municipality of the same name. The explored site was a civic-religious center with a palace and an altar to Quetzalcoatl. Los Tepoltzis is located outside the community of Tixtla and consists of a number of small sites including a ceremonial center thirty meters long, three meters high with stairways and a plaza. Huamuxtitlán is in the municipality of the same name. While the site is covers significant territory only one pyramid has been uncovered. Most of the rest of the site consists of living quarters. Near this site are smaller sites along the Tlapaneco River.

===Outdoor activities===

The state has a number of sites suitable for ecotourism, including mountains, caves, wild areas for the observation of flora and fauna, camping and areas that offer extreme sports. Many of the extreme sports are offered in the Acapulco area including high-speed water jets, kayaking, canoeing, river rafting, rock climbing, spelunking, paintball, mountain climbing, parasailing and more. Activities in other parts of the state include rafting on the Papagayo River, kayaking and canoeing in Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo, rock-climbing in Chilpancingo and Taxco, mountain climbing in Ixcateopan, rappelling in Zihuatanejo and bungee jumping and parasailing in Iguala.

There are a number of caves to explore such as Grutas Dos Arroyos in Dos Arroyos, various small caves in Pueblo Bravo and some in Acapulco. The best known caves in the state are in the Grutas de Cacahuamilpa National Park. This park is home to the Grutas de Cacahuamilpa Caverns and Grutas de Carlos Pacheco. The first is a live cave with many rock formations still in progress. This has infrastructure for tourists and guided tours. The second set of caves is a dry cave with less infrastructure.

==Handcrafts==
Crafts form an important part of the state&#x27;s economy, providing all or part of many families&#x27; income. The state government passed the Ley de Fomento a la Cultural in 1988 which works to protect crafts produced within the state. One type of handcraft produced in the state is metalworking with most precious and non-precious metals. The best known work produced in the state is made with silver, centered in the town of Taxco. Each year this town holds the annual National Silver Fair (Feria Nacional de la Plata). Gold is worked in locations such as Iguala, Ciudad Altamirano, Coyuca de Catalán, Arcelia and Ometepec. Steel machetes and other items are produced in Ayutla, Tixtla, Chilapa, Tecpan deGaleana and Ometepec. Gold leaf is done in Tlacotepec, Tlalchipa and Cuetzala del Progreso. Costume jewelry is made in Acatlán, and Chilapa, producing buttons of various colors, pieces made of brass coated in nickel, glass and metal wire to produce items such as necklaces, bracelets, and more. Other jewelry is made by twisting and weaving fine strands of silver or gold wire. Silver is mostly done in Taxco, with gold pieces in Ciudad Altamirano.

Wooden items are locally painted and coated with a high-gloss lacquer (). The best pieces of this type are made of a distinctively aromatic wood called (from &quot;Bursera aloexylon&quot;). But due to &#x27;s relative scarcity, cheaper ones are made from pine and treated to smell like . The making of lacquered items is centered in the municipality of Olinalá, but also in Temalcalcingo, Ocotepec and Acapetlahuaya. Items made include small boxes, chests, trays, masks, frames, jewelry boxes.

Pottery is a very traditional craft and is practices in many of the communities of the state, although most of the wares produced are basic and meant for local consumption. These items include cooking pots, water containers, pitchers, candle holders and some sculptured decorative items. Most of these items have been made the same way since the pre-Hispanic period. The best quality ware is considered to be made in the central valleys in municipalities such as Zacualpan, Nuitzalapa, Atzacualoya, and others. Some areas have become specialized for certain types of pieces. The San Juan neighborhood of Chilapa make figures of a cerarmic which is glassy after firing. Acatlán makes ceramic toys, and Ometepec specializes in the making of very large cántaro jars, traditionally used for storage.

Clothing and textiles are mostly made by indigenous communities such as the Nahuas, Mixtecos and Amuzgos, who use weaving and embroidery patterns to distinguish themselves from one another. The most distinctive indigenous clothing item is the huipil although rebozos and other items are also made.. While much is made for local consumption, indigenous clothing can be found in tourist areas and other markets as well as tablecloths, napkins and other decorative pieces. Communities with reputation for their textiles include Tlacoachistlahuaca, Xochistlahuaca, Yoloxóchilt (San Luis Acatlán) and Acatlán (Chilapa).

Another craft, practiced mostly along the central and coastal areas, is that of palm frond weaving. With these fronds items like hats, bags, fans, mats, animal figures and more are made. A particular type of hat made in this fashion in Chilapa, Zitlala, Zapotitlán Tablas and Ahuacoutzingo is called a “costeño” hat.

Most handcrafted furniture is made in Taxco and Ixcatepoan, in which an aromatic cedar is found. Other furniture producing areas are Chilpancingo, Iguala, Teloloapan and Ciudad Altamirano. In addition to furniture, items such as masks and figures are carved from wood.

One craft which is specific to the state is painting using traditional amate or bark paper as a canvas. This craft began in the 1970s in Xalitla, located between Iguala and Chilpancingo. Since that time, these paintings or drawings have become known both inside and outside of Mexico. The best known works today come from the communities of Maxela, San Juan, Ahuelicán and Ahuehuepan. Most of the themes of these paintings are related to agriculture, everyday life and religion.

Leathercrafts is mostly limited to saddlemaking and other items relating to horseback riding. This is prominent in areas such as San Jerónimo, Chilpancingo, Tixtla, Quechultenango and others. Other crafts include stone sculpting and the cutting of precious and semiprecious stones, buttons and other items for clothing and costume jewelry.

==Politics==
The state is divided into 81 municipalities and seven political regions. The largest municipality is Coahuayutla at 3,511.5 km2 and the most recently created one is Iliatenco in the La Montaña region. The three best-known communities of the state are Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Taxco. Angel Aguirre Rivero was governor of the state until October 27, 2014 with Rogelio Ortiz Martinez succeeding him after he resigned.

==Geography==

The state of Guerrero has a territory of . The state borders the states of Mexico, Morelos, Puebla, Michoacán, Oaxaca, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Geographically, the state is divided into three regions: La Montaña (mountains), Tierra Caliente (hot lands) of the northeast and La Costa (coast). La Montaña is mostly forested and is concentrated in the north and east of the state. Tierra Caliente and is situated in the lowlands along the Balsas River. This area also extends into Michoacán state and is called similarly. La Costa is divided into two subregions called Costa Chica and Costa Grande. The Costa Chica extends from Acapulco to the border with Oaxaca. Costa Grande extends west of Acapulco to the Balsas River. Much of the state&#x27;s current agriculture and livestock raising concentrated in La Costa as it is relatively flat.

Most of the state is covered in mountains of varying heights, with deep canyons with flat areas limited to small mesas and the coastline. Most of the mountains belong to the Sierra Madre del Sur mountain range. The exception is the mountains of the Taxco area which belong to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and include the small mountain ranges of the Sierra de Sultepec, Sierra de Zacualpan and the Sierra de Zultepec. These are connected to the same volcanic system as the Nevado de Toluca.

The coast extends for about and includes features such as the Balsas River delta, Mongles Point, Ixtapa Point, Zihuatanejo Bay, Ixtapa Island, Acapulco Bay, Apies Island, Islas Blancas, San Gabriel Island, Islas Frailes Blancos or Rocas de Potosi, Punta Gorda, and others. There are a number of lagoons along the coast including the Laguna de Potosi in Morro de Petatlán, Lagunas de Mitla, the Laguna de Nusco and the Laguna de Coyuca.

The Balsas River enters Guerrero from Puebla state where it is formed. Prior to reaching the town of Balsas, the river is called Mexcala, then Balsas to the ocean. The Nexapa River is a tributary of the upper portion of the Balsas. The Amacuzac River enters the state from the State of Mexico. It passes under the Grutas de Cacahuamilco, then reemerges to form part of the border between Guerrero and Morelos. The Tepecoacuilco or Huitzuco River forms within the state and is a tributary of the Balsas. The Cocula or Iguala River forms in the Taxco area and is one of the major drainages of this region. Other rivers in the state include the Cuetzala, the Alohuixtla, the Cutzamala, the Tlapaneco Huamuxtitlan, the Milpilla or Zumpango, the Río del Oro, the Zayulapa, the Huautla and the Río Unión.

The Middle America Trench lies in the Pacific Ocean, parallel to Guerrero&#x27;s coast. This trench is a subduction zone, where the oceanic Cocos Plate is sliding under the continental North American Plate. Subduction zones can produce large earthquakes, like the 2012 Guerrero–Oaxaca earthquake on March 20, 2012.

=== Climate ===
The state&#x27;s climate is dominated by the rainy tropical areas and rainy temperate areas. The former has high temperatures above year round and experiences most rain in the summer and early fall. Most of this is found near the coast under asl. In the higher elevations away from the coast in the Sierra Madre del Sur, the climate is temperate but also experiences the same pattern of rainfall. Most of the rain that falls in the state is produced from evaporation from the Pacific Ocean.

=== Flora and fauna ===
Flora of the state is determined by altitude and climate. The higher mountain areas have forests of pine and oyamel fir, with amate, and other tropical trees found in the lower elevations. Tropical hardwoods are mostly found in the lower elevations near the coast. The state has a wide variety of wildlife from deer, small mammals, large numbers of birds and reptiles and insects.

Five terrestrial ecoregions extend across the state. The Southern Pacific dry forests lie on the southern slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains, extending from the coast up to 1400 meters elevation. The forests are predominantly deciduous during the long dry season. The Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests occupy the higher slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur. These forests harbor a great diversity of species, including many endemic orchids, butterflies, and birds. The Balsas dry forests lie in the basin of the Balsas River, north of the Sierra Madre del Sur, and are notable for the diversity of mammal species, including the jaguarundi, coati, ocelot, and collared peccary. The northernmost part of the state includes portions of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests, which occupy the mountainous northern rim of the Balsas basin. The Mexican South Pacific mangroves are found in coastal lagoons along the coast of Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. Guerrero is the Mexican state where the tarantula species &quot;Brachypelma smithi&quot; is also found.

The Parque Natural de Guerrero is a natural reserve located in the central valleys of the state, extending for about eighty kilometers squared. Most of the area is covered in pine and holm oak forests that covered the high altitude valleys of this region.


==Economy==
Agricultural production is mostly of staple crops such as corn, rice and beans along with tomatoes, tomatillos, okra, green chili peppers, chickpeas, soybeans, yams, and other vegetables. Commercial crops include coffee, hibiscus, sugar cane, sesame seed, peanuts and sorghum. A number of fruits are grown for both domestic consumption and market such as melons, papaya, watermelon, mangos, bananas, tamarind and citrus.

Guerrero is the number one producer of poppy flower in Mexico. On a global scale, Guerrero shares the first place with Afghanistan. Mexico provides more than 90 percent of US&#x27;s heroin. The poppy flower has become an economic support for many families in the &quot;Sierra de Guerrero&quot; (Guerrero mountain chain), since it is much more profitable than any other crop. Due to the high poverty rates, many peasants prefer to grow the poppy flower in order to cover their basic needs.

The state has large forests with logging potential, although most are ejido or other community property. Most of the loggable timber is pine.

Fishing is an important industry for the state with livestock raised is limited due to poor pastures due to overgrazing. They include cattle, pigs, goats and sheep as well as some domestic fowl. The long coast is important for fishing which support 55 fishing communities. The main fishing ports are Petacalco, Zihuatanejo, Acapulco, Barra de Tecoanapa and Puna Maldonado. Commercial fishing brings in shark, sailfish, sierra, sea bass, mojarra, lobster, shrimp, clams and many other species.

The mountains in the interior of the state have mineral deposits, such as gold and lead as well as iron. The latter is found mostly along the Balsas River.

Tourism is the most important sector of the state&#x27;s commerce. Tourism in Guerrero is important to the overall Mexican economy as well. It is the main source of the state&#x27;s economic development.

The main employment generators of the state are service industry (28.2% of workers), commerce, restaurants and hotels (25.1%), financial services and real estate (13.4) and manufacturing (12.2%).

However, due to the lack of employment and the general lack of education of many in Guerrero, the state ranks number one in the number of migrants that head to the United States to work. It is estimated that each year 73,000 head north to live permanently with another 128,000 who migrate each year during the dry season. It is also estimated what somewhere between one quarter and one third of Guerrero&#x27;s population lives in the United States, with about 300,000 in the Chicago area alone. The phenomenon has left many villages with no men and women taking up most of the work such as farming, crafts and petty commerce.

==Education==
Until the 1970s, illiteracy was a major problem in Guerrero. However, the rate of illiteracy was down from 48% to 26.8% from 1970 to 1990. Illiteracy still remains a problem with a 21.55% rate. The lowest levels are in Acapulco and Iguala with the highest in rural municipalities such as Metlatonoc (80.6%) and Tlacoachistlahuaca (73.3%). However, the literacy rate for those between 6 and 14 year of age is 80%.

From pre-school through high school, the state has 9,559 schools, staffed by 44,239 teachers. The state university is the Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, which was initially founded as the Instituto Literario de Álvarez in 1852 in Acapulco. It was transferred to Chilpancingo when that city was made the capital in 1870. The institution was reorganized a number of times with the most modern structure taking shape in 1960, when the institution was named the Universidad de Guerrero. The current name was granted in 1963 when it became autonomous from direct state control.

There is also education in the native Amuzgo Guerrero language.

==Infrastructure==
===Media===
Guerrero has a number of radio stations, one television channel, which broadcasts from the capital, with the rest satellite TV. Newspapers of Guerrero include: &quot;Diario 17&quot;, &quot;Diario 21&quot;, &quot;El Sol de Acapulco&quot;, &quot;El Sur, Periódico de Guerrero&quot;, &quot;La Jornada Guerrero&quot;, &quot;Novedades de Acapulco&quot;, and &quot;Pueblo Guerrero .&quot;

===Transport===
There are international airports in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo as well as private airstrips.

<text>Chilpancingo de los Bravo (commonly shortened to Chilpancingo; ; Nahuatl: Chilpantzinco ()) is the capital and second-largest city of the Mexican state of Guerrero. In 2010 it had a population of 187,251 people. The municipality has an area of in the south-central part of the state, situated in the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains, on the bank of the Huacapa River. The city is on Federal Highway 95, which connects Acapulco to Mexico City. It is served by Chilpancingo National Airport, which is one of the five airports in the state.

==History==
In pre-Columbian times, the area was occupied by the Olmecs, who built an extensive tunnel network through the mountains, and left the cave paintings in the caverns of Juxtlahuaca. The city of Chilpancingo was founded on 1 November 1591 by the Spanish conquistadores, its name meaning &quot;Place of Wasps&quot; in Nahuatl. During the War of Independence, Chilpancingo was crucial to the insurgent cause as its population participated actively and decisively in their favor, and it became a strategic point for military action in the south. Chilpancingo was very important to Mexican history because it was here where the National Congress met under José María Morelos y Pavón in 1813 during the War of Independence.
General Nicolás Catalán, husband of the independence war heroine Antonia Nava de Catalán, was made commander of the state of Guerrero on 24 January 1828. The family settled in Chilpancingo, where both Nicolás and Antonia later died.
In 1853, Chilpancingo was declared the provisional capital of the state, due to an epidemic that struck the then capital of Tixtla, and regional ecclesiastical organizational changes were made at the same time. In 1870 it was again declared capital by Governor Francisco O. Arce, due to the opposition led by General Jiménez, who was in possession of the official seat of government at Tixtla. It was not until 1871, when the state legislature agreed to a change of venue, that the capital was moved again from Chilpancingo.
During the Mexican Revolution, Chilpancingo was deeply troubled and had political and administrative importance as a strategic place for the sides in the debate. Battles took place in the vicinity in the 1910s, in which Emiliano Zapata defeated federal forces of Porfirio Díaz, Francisco I. Madero, Victoriano Huerta and Venustiano Carranza. A major defeat of Huerta&#x27;s southern forces took place here in March-April 1914; the Zapatistas took the town until after the 1917 Constitutional Convention.

In 1960, the city entered a severe social crisis with the start of a student popular movement at the Autonomous University of Guerrero, protests which led to a general strike at the institution and later swarmed to various forces and social sectors of the city and the state. The main objective was to diminish the power of the state government and seek autonomy for the college. On 27 April 2009 an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.6 was centered near Chilpancingo.

On 6 October 2024, mayor Alejandro Arcos was beheaded just six days after taking office, allegedly by drug cartels. His murder came three days after Francisco Tapia, the city government&#x27;s secretary, was shot to death.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

The climate of Chilpacingo is classified as a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;). There is some moderation due to high elevation, but high temperatures are still in the upper 20s °C (80s °F) for most of the year. 
==Economy==
In 1869, the Autonomous University of Guerrero was established in Chilpancingo; it still plays a considerable role in the local economy.
The city is a producer of processed foods and alcoholic beverages, and is a market for maize, sugarcane, bananas, livestock, and lumber produced in the region.

==Archaeology==

<text>The Ghent Altarpiece, also called the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb (), is a very large and complex 15th-century polyptych altarpiece in St Bavo&#x27;s Cathedral, Ghent, Belgium. It was begun around the mid-1420s and completed by 1432, and it is attributed to the Early Netherlandish painters and brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck. The altarpiece is a prominent example of the transition from Middle Age to Renaissance art and is considered a masterpiece of European art, identified by some as &quot;the first major oil painting.&quot;

The panels are organised in two vertical registers, each with double sets of foldable wings containing inner and outer panel paintings. The upper register of the inner panels represents the heavenly redemption, and includes the central classical &quot;Deësis&quot; arrangement of God (identified either as Christ the King or God the Father), flanked by the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist. They are flanked in the next panels by angels playing music and, on the far outermost panels, the figures of Adam and Eve. The central panel of the lower register shows a gathering of saints, sinners, clergy, and soldiers attendant at an adoration of the Lamb of God. There are several groupings of figures, overseen by the dove of the Holy Spirit. The four lower panels of the closed altar are divided into two pairs; sculptural grisaille paintings of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, and on the two outer panels, donor portraits of Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut; in the upper row are the archangel Gabriel and the Annunciation, and at the very top are the prophets and sibyls. The altarpiece is one of the most renowned and important artworks in European history.

Art historians generally agree that the overall structure was designed by Hubert during or before the mid-1420s, probably before 1422, and that the panels were painted by his younger brother Jan. Yet, while generations of art historians have attempted to attribute specific passages to either brother, no convincing separation has been established; it may be that Jan finished panels begun by Hubert.

The altarpiece was commissioned by the merchant and Ghent mayor Jodocus Vijd and his wife Lysbette as part of a larger project for the Saint Bavo Cathedral chapel. Its installation was officially celebrated on 6 May 1432. Much later, for security reasons, it was moved to the principal cathedral chapel, where it remains.

Indebted to the International Gothic as well as Byzantine and Romanic traditions, the altarpiece represented a significant advancement in Western art, in which the idealisation of the medieval tradition gives way to an exacting observation of nature and human representation. A now lost inscription on the frame stated that Hubert van Eyck &quot;maior quo nemo repertus&quot; (greater than anyone) started the altarpiece, but that Jan van Eyckcalling himself &quot;arte secundus&quot; (second best in the art)completed it in 1432. The altarpiece is in its original location, while its original, very ornate, carved outer frame and surround, presumably harmonizing with the painted tracery, was destroyed during the Reformation; it may have included clockwork mechanisms for moving the shutters and even for playing music.

== Attribution ==
The merchant Jodocus Vijd, then Mayor of Ghent, and his wife Lysbette commissioned the altarpiece as part of a larger development project for the Saint Bavo Cathedral chapel. The installation of the altarpiece was officially celebrated on 6 May 1432; it was much later moved for security reasons to the principal cathedral chapel, where it remains.
Art historians broadly agree that the overall structure was designed and built by Hubert in the early 1420s, and that most of the panels paintings were completed by his younger brother Jan between 1430 and 1432. Yet there has been considerable debate, and many art historians, especially in the mid 20th century, attempted to attribute specific passages to either brother. However, no convincing separation of their contributions has been established. A now lost inscription on the frame stated that Hubert van Eyck &quot;maior quo nemo repertus&quot; (greater than anyone) started the altarpiece, but that Jan van Eyck—calling himself &quot;arte secundus&quot; (second best in the art)—completed it in 1432. The original, very ornate carved outer frame and surround, presumably harmonizing with the painted tracery, was destroyed during the Reformation; it may have included clockwork mechanisms for moving the shutters and even playing music.

Attribution to the van Eyck brothers is supported by the small amount of surviving documentary evidence attached to the commission, and from Jan&#x27;s signature and dating on a reverse frame. Jan seems to minimize his contribution in favour of his brother, who died six years before the work&#x27;s completion in 1432. A less explicit indicator is their seeming portraits as the third and fourth horsemen in the Just Judges panel. Ramsay Homa notes lettering in the central panel of the lower register that might be read as an early formation of what was to become van Eyck&#x27;s well-known signature, built around various formations of (&quot;As I Can&quot;), a pun on his full name; and lettering is found on the headdress of one of the prophets standing at the back of the grouping. It is written in Hebrew script that roughly translates into French as &quot;Le chapeau ... orne de trois lettres herbraiques formant le mot Saboth&quot;, or more likely as &quot;Yod, Feh, Aleph&quot;, which when transliterated represents Jan&#x27;s initials, JvE.

Since the 19th century, art historians have debated which passages are attributable to the unknown Hubert or internationally renowned Jan. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was often assumed that Jan had found unfinished panels left behind after Hubert&#x27;s death and assembled them into the current format. This view has been discounted by more recent scholarship on the basis of the overall design of the work and given the obvious gaps in quality between many passages.

It is generally accepted that the majority of the work was completed by Jan based on a design by Hubert, who probably oversaw the original design and construction of the panels. The difficulties are complicated by the fact that there is no surviving work confidently attributed to Hubert and it is thus impossible to detect his style. Instead, art historians compare individual passages to known works by Jan, looking for stylistic differences that may indicate the work of another hand. Advances in dendrochronology indicate that parts of the wing panels were felled around 1421. Allowing a seasoning time of at least 10 years, art historians assume a completion date well after Hubert&#x27;s death in 1426, thus ruling out his hand from large portions of the wings.

==Style and technique==

The polyptych differs in a number of aspects from the other paintings attributed to Jan van Eyck, not least in scale. It is the only one of his works intended for public, rather than private, worship and display. Van Eyck pays as much attention to the beauty of earthly things as to the religious themes. The clothes and jewels, the fountain, nature surrounding the scene, the churches and landscape in the background – are all painted with remarkable detail. The landscape is rich with vegetation, which is observed with an almost scientific accuracy, and much of it non-European.

Lighting is one of the major innovations of the polyptych. The panels contain complex light effects and subtle plays of shadow, the rendering of which was achieved through new techniques of handling both oil paint and transparent glazes. The figures are mostly cast with short, diagonal shadows which serve to, in the words of art historian Till-Holger Borchert, &quot;not only heighten their spatial presence, but also tell us that the primary light source is located beyond the picture itself.&quot; In the &quot;Annunciation&quot; scene, shadows imply that they emanate from the daylight within the chapel in which they are housed. Further innovations can be found in the detailing of surface textures, especially in the reflections of light. These are best seen in light falling on the armour in the &quot;Knights of Christ&quot; panel, and the ripple of the water in the Fountain of life in the &quot;Adoration of the Mystic Lamb&quot;.

==Open view==
The altarpiece was opened on feast days when the richness, colour and complexity of the inner panels was intended to contrast with the relative austerity of the outer panels. As viewed when open, the panels are organised along two registers (levels), and contain depictions of hundreds of figures. The upper level consists of seven monumental panels, each almost six feet high, and includes a large central image of Christ flanked by frames showing Mary (left) and John the Baptist (right), which contain over twenty inscriptions each referring to the figures in the central Deësis panels.

These panels are flanked by two pairs of images on the folding wings. The two panels closest to the Deësis show singers in heaven; the outermost pair show Adam and Eve, naked save for strategically placed leaves. The lower register has a panoramic landscape stretching continuously across five panels. While the individual panels of the upper tier clearly contain separate—albeit paired—pictorial spaces, the lower tier is presented as a unified &quot;Mise en scène&quot;. Of the 12 panels, eight have paintings on their reverse visible when the altarpiece is closed.

===Upper register===

====Deësis====
The three central upper panels show a Deësis of monumental and enthroned figures, each with a halo. They are the Virgin Mary to the left, John the Baptist to the right and a central figure who may be either God or Christ – a distinction much debated amongst art historians. Theories include that the panel shows Christ in Majesty dressed in priestly vestments, God the Father, or the Holy Trinity amalgamated into a single person. The figure looks directly towards the viewer with his hand raised in blessing, in a panel filled with inscriptions and symbols. There are Greek inscriptions decorated with pearls on the hem of his mantle (possibly a cope, fastened by a bejewelled morse or clasp) which are from Revelation: (&quot;King of Kings, and Lord of Lords&quot;).

The golden brocade on the throne features pelicans and vine, probable references to the blood spilled during the Crucifixion of Jesus. Pelicans were at the time believed to spill their own blood to feed their young. The vines allude to sacramental wine used to confect the Eucharist.

An openwork crown is at his feet, and on either side the step is lined with two levels of text. The left hand upper line reads (&quot;Life without death on his head&quot;), that on the right (&quot;Youth without age on his forehead&quot;). These are placed above—on the left and right respectively—the words (&quot;Joy without sorrow on his right side&quot;) and (&quot;Safety without fear on his left side&quot;). On his head is another jewel-encrusted crown similar to the papal tiara or &quot;triregnum,&quot; with its white body, three tiers, green lappets, and monde with a cross on top.

Mary reads from a girdle book draped with a green cloth. A book is a normal attribute for Mary, as one of her titles is &quot;Seat of Wisdom&quot; and this image might be based on the figure in Robert Campin&#x27;s &quot;Virgin Annunciate&quot;. She wears an open crown adorned with flowers and stars and is dressed as a bride. The inscription above her arched throne reads: &quot;She is more beautiful than the sun and the army of the stars; compared to the light she is superior. She is truly the reflection of eternal light and a spotless mirror of God&quot;.

Like his aunt Mary, John the Baptist also holds a holy book – an unusual attribute; these are two of the 18 books in the entire piece. He wears a green mantle over a cilice of camel-hair, his usual attribute. He looks towards the Almighty in the centre panel, his hand also raised in blessing, uttering the words most typically attributed to him, (&quot;Behold the Lamb of God&quot;).

It is often assumed that the foreshortening seen in the representation of God the Father indicates that the artist was familiar with the Italian painters Donatello and Masaccio. The art historian Susie Nash argues that van Eyck was already leading toward this development, and it was something he was &quot;perfectly capable of producing without such models&quot;, and argues the technique represents &quot;a shared interest [rather than] a case of influence.&quot;

====Musical angels====
The two musical panels are commonly known by variants of the titles &quot;Singing Angels&quot; and &quot;Music-making Angels&quot;, and are both 161 cm × 69.3 cm. Each features a choir; on the left, angels gather behind a wooden carved music stand positioned on a swivel, and to the right, a group with stringed instruments gather around a pipe organ, played by a seated angel, shown full-length. The presence of the two groups on either side of the Deësis reflects a by-then well-established motif in representations of the heavens opening: that of musical accompaniment provided by celestial beings. As was common in the Low Countries in the 15th century, the angels are dressed in liturgical robes, a custom that migrated from Latin liturgical drama to the art of the period.

The angels attend the King of Kings, that is, to God the Father in the central Deësis panel. Unusually, they lack most of the attributes usually associated with angels depicted in northern art of the time. They do not have wings, and their faces are unidealised, and show a number of different individual expressions. Music historian Stanley Boorman notes that their depiction contains many earthly qualities, writing that &quot;the naturalism is so seductive that the viewer is tempted to consider the scenes as depictions of contemporary church music.&quot; Yet he concludes that the inscriptions &quot;reinstalls them in the heavenly sphere&quot;. In both panels the angels stand on maiolica tiles decorated with the IHS Christogram, representations of the lamb and other images.
The left-hand panel&#x27;s frame is inscribed with the words (&quot;Music in Praise of God&quot;), the frame of to the right with (&quot;Praise him with stringed instruments and organs&quot;). A number of art historians have defined the figures as angels based on their positioning and role within the overall context of the registers. They are sexless and possess cherub faces, which contrast with the realistic depictions of the other full-sized non-divine females in the work; Eve in the same register and Lysbette Borluut in the outer panels. The angels are dressed in elaborately brocaded ecclesiastical copes or chasubles, mostly painted in reds and greens. Their robes indicate that they are intended as representative of the celebration of mass before the altar in the lower central panel.

The left-hand group shows eight fair haired angels wearing crowns and gathered in front of a music stand singing, although none of them looks towards the score on the stand. As in a number of the other panels, here van Eyck used the device of the open mouth to give a sense of life and motion to his figures. Borchert writes that the emphasis on the open mouths is &quot;specifically motivated by the desire to characterize the angel&#x27;s facial expressions according to the various ranges of polyphonic singing. To that end the position of the angel&#x27;s tongues is carefully registered, as is that of their teeth.&quot; Art historian Elisabeth Dhanens notes how &quot;One can easily see by their singing who is the soprano, who is the alto, who is the tenor and who is the bass&quot;.
The figures are positioned in a wave-like order of body height, with the orientation of each of the eight faces in looking in different directions. A number of scholars have remarked on their physiognomy. Their cherub faces and long, open, curly hair are similar but also show a clear intention by the artist to establish individual traits. Four angels are shown frowning, three have narrowed eyelids which give the appearance of peering, a trait also seen in some of the apostles in the &quot;Adoration of the Lamb&quot;. Pächt does not see Jan&#x27;s hand in the rendering of their expressions and speculates if they are remnants from Hubert&#x27;s initial design.

In the right-hand panel, the only angel fully visible is the organist around whom the others gather. Although a larger group is suggested, only another four angel&#x27;s faces can be seen in the closely cropped huddle. These other angels carry stringed instruments, including a small harp and a type of viol. Their instruments are shown in remarkable detail. The organ at which Saint Cecilia sits is detailed with such precision that, in places, its metal surfaces show reflections of light.

Modern musicologists have been able to recreate a working copy of the instrument. Until the Trecento, when the idea of orchestration was introduced, music-playing angels were typically winged, depicted holding stringed or wind instruments as they hovered &quot;on the wing&quot; around on the edges of images of saints and deities. In French illuminated manuscripts of the first two decades of the 15th century, winged angels often seemingly floated on the margins of the page, as illustrations to the accompanying text.

====Adam and Eve====
The two outer panels show near life-sized nudes of Adam and Eve standing in niches. They are one of the earliest and direct treatments of the nude in Western art, and almost contemporary with the equally ground-breaking figures in Masaccio&#x27;s &quot;Expulsion from the Garden of Eden&quot; (Florence, c. 1425). They face inwards towards the angels and the Deësis, separating them. They self-consciously attempt to cover their nakedness with a leaf as in the Genesis account (although apparently not a figleaf), indicating that they are depicted as after the fall of man. Eve holds a fruit in her right hand. Erwin Panofsky drew particular attention to this passage, describing it as emblematic of the &quot;disguised&quot; symbolism he saw through the work. Both figures&#x27; eyes are downcast and they appear to have forlorn expressions. Their apparent sadness has led many art historians to wonder about van Eyck&#x27;s intention in this portrayal. Some have questioned if they are ashamed of their committal of original sin, or dismayed at the world they now look upon.

The painter&#x27;s unflinching realism is especially evident in these two panels. The depiction of Eve exemplifies International Gothic ideal of beauty as developed from around the start of the 14th century, pioneered by the Limbourg brothers, especially their Adam and Eve in the &quot;Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot;. Comparing the Limbourg&#x27;s Eve to a classical female nude, Kenneth Clark observed that &quot;her pelvis is wider, her chest narrower, her waist higher; above all there is the prominence given to her stomach&quot;. Clark describes her as &quot;a proof of how minutely &#x27;realistic&#x27; a great artist may be in the rendering of details, and yet subordinate the whole to an ideal form. Hers is the supreme example of the bulb-like body. The weight-bearing leg is concealed, and the body is so contrived that on one side is the long curve of the stomach, on the other the downward sweep of the thigh, uninterrupted by any articulation of bone or muscle.&quot;

The precision and detail with which their nakedness is recorded offended many over the years. During a visit to the cathedral in 1781, Emperor Joseph II found them so disagreeable that he demanded they be removed. The couple&#x27;s nakedness further offended 19th century sensibilities, when their presence in a church came to be considered unacceptable. The panels were replaced by reproductions in which the figures were dressed in skin cloth; these are still on display in Saint Bavo Cathedral. In comparison to contemporary depictions of Adam and Eve, this version is very spare and omits the usual motifs associated with the theme; there is no serpent, tree or any trace of the Garden of Eden normally found in contemporary paintings.

Adam&#x27;s foot appears to protrude out of the niche into the viewer&#x27;s space. Similarly, Eve&#x27;s arm, shoulder and hip appear to extend beyond her architectural setting. These elements give the panel a three-dimensional aspect. These trompe-l&#x27;œils become more pronounced when the wings are turned slightly inwards, and contract to the fact that the polyptych was wider than the original setting and could never be opened fully.

The grisaille above Adam shows Abel sacrificing the first lamb of his flock, and his brother Cain presenting crops to the Lord. Above them Eve is a representation of Abel murdering by Cain with what appears as an ass&#x27;s jawbone.

===Lower register===
A continuous panoramic landscape unifies the five panels of the lower register. The large central panel shows the adoration of the Lamb of God (&quot;Agnus Dei&quot;) arranged in a scene derived from the Gospel of John. A series of crowds of people stream towards the lamb to worship; four groupings congregate at each corner of the central panel, another four arrive in the two pairs of outer panels – representing the Warriors of Christ and Just Judges on the left-hand side, and the holy hermits and pilgrims on the right. Of the eight groupings only one consists of females. The groupings are segregated by their relationship to the old and new testaments, with those from the older books positioned to the left of the altar.

Among the pilgrims is Saint Christopher, patron saint of travellers. At the rear of the hermits on the inner right-hand panel is Mary Magdalene, carrying unguents.

====&quot;Adoration of the Mystic Lamb&quot;====
Measuring 134.3 × 237.5 cm, the center panel has as its centerpiece an altar on which the Lamb of God is positioned, standing in a verdant meadow, while the foreground shows a fountain. Five distinct groups of figures surround altar and fountain. In the mid-ground two further groups of figures are seen gathering; the dove of the Holy Spirit is above. The meadow is framed by trees and bushes; with the spires of Jerusalem visible in the background. Dhanens says the panel shows &quot;a magnificent display of unequaled color, a rich panorama of late medieval art and the contemporary world-view.&quot; The iconography, suggested by the groupings of the figures, appears to follow the liturgy of All Saints&#x27; Day.

The lamb stands on an altar, and is surrounded by 14 angels arranged in a circle, some holding symbols of Christ&#x27;s Passion, and two swing censers. The lamb has a wound on its breast from which blood gushes into a golden chalice, yet it shows no outward expression of pain, a reference to Christ&#x27;s sacrifice. The lamb has a human-like face which appears to be looking directly out of the panel, similar to the subjects of Jan van Eyck&#x27;s single head portraits. The angels have multicoloured wings and hold instruments of Christ&#x27;s passion, including the cross and the crown of thorns. The antependium on the upper portion of the front of the altar is inscribed with the words taken from John 1:29; (&quot;Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world&quot;). The lappets bear the phrases (&quot;Jesus the Way&quot;) and (&quot;the Truth, the Life&quot;).

A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, hovers low in the sky directly above the lamb, surrounded by concentric semicircles of white and yellow hues of varying luminosity, the outermost of which appear like nimbus clouds. Thin golden beams emanating from the dove resemble those surrounding the head of the lamb, as well as those of the three figures in the Deësis in the upper register. The rays seem to have been painted by van Eyck over the finished landscape and serve to illuminate the scene in a celestial, supernatural light. This is especially true with the light falling on the saints positioned directly in front of the altar. The light does not give reflection or throw shadow, and has traditionally been read by art historians as representing the New Jerusalem of Revelation which in 21:23, had &quot;no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the glory of God did Lighten it&quot;.

The illumination contrasts with the natural and directional lighting of the four upper interior wings and of each of the outer wings. It has been interpreted as a device to emphasize the presence of the divine and accentuate the paradise of the central landscape. The dove as the Holy Spirit, and the lamb as Jesus, are positioned on the same axis as that of God The Father in the panel directly above; a reference to the Holy Trinity.
In the center foreground, the fountain of life consists of a large stream of water, ending with a jewel-laden bed. In the distance, a minutely detailed cityscape recalls New Jerusalem. The detail and close attention to landscape and nature is at a level previously unseen in Northern European art. The numerous recognisable species of plants are minutely depicted with high levels of botanical accuracy. Similarly, the clouds and rock formations in the distance contain degrees of verisimilitude that evince studied observation. The far landscape contains representations of actual churches, while the depiction of the mountains beyond contain the first known example in art of aerial perspective. Yet the panel does not strive for exact realism; the sum of the forensically detailed natural elements, in combination with the apparition of the Holy Spirit and extended beams of light, serve to create a wholly individual and uniquely creative interpretation of a classic biblical scene.

=====Fountain of life=====
The inscription on the fountain&#x27;s rim reads (&quot;This is the fountain of the water of life, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb&quot;, cf. Rev. 22:1), symbolizing the fountain of life is &quot;watered by the blood of the Lamb&quot;. The column at the fountain center shows an angel above dragons in bronze, from which streams of water fall into its basin. A vertical axis forms between the fountain, altar and the dove, signifying the agreeing testimony of The Spirit, water and the blood, as cited in 1 John 5:6–8. There is also similarity between the altar, the ring of angels, and the multiple figures arranged around the fountain.

=====Prophets, Apostles, church figures=====
The representations of figures gathering on each side of the fountain are drawn from biblical, pagan and contemporary ecclesiastical sources. Some are crowded around the fountain in what Pächt describes as two &quot;processions of figures [that] have crowded to a halt&quot;. To the left are representatives of figures from Judaism and prophets who have foretold the coming of Christ; to the right are representatives from the Church. The figures directly to the left of the fountain represent witnesses from the Old Testament; dressed in pink robes, kneeling, reading aloud from open copies of the Bible, facing the mid-ground with backs turned to the viewer.
A larger group of pagan philosophers and writers stand behind them. These men seem to have travelled from all over the world, given the Oriental faces of some and their different styles of headdresses. The figure in white, holding a laurel wreath, is generally accepted to be Virgil, who is said to have predicted the coming of the Saviour. Isaiah stands to his side holding a twig, a symbol of his own prophecy of Christ as recorded in Isaiah 11:1.

On the right, twelve apostles from the New Testament kneel, and behind them is a group of male saints. These are dressed in red vestments symbolizing martyrs, the Popes and other clergy representing the church hierarchy. A number are recognizable, including Saint Stephen who carries the rocks with which he was stoned. Three popes in the foreground represent the Western Schism—a dispute that festered and lingered in Ghent—and are identifiable as Martin V, Gregory VII and Antipope Alexander V. Dhanens suggests the positioning of popes standing beside antipope shows &quot;an atmosphere of reconciliation&quot;.

=====Confessors and martyrs=====
The groups of figures in the mid-ground, to the left and right of the altar, are known as the male and female martyrs. Identifiable biblical figures carry palms. They enter the pictorial space as though through a path in the foliage, males standing to the left, women to the right. The female martyrs, sometimes known as the holy virgins, are gathered by an abundant meadow, a symbol of fertility. A number are identified by their attributes: in front St. Agnes carries a lamb, St. Barbara holds a tower, while St. Dorothy carries flowers. Further back St. Ursula carries an arrow. The men on the left include confessors, popes, cardinals, abbots and monks who are dressed in blue.

=====Just Judges and the Knights of Christ=====
The wing panels to the left of the &quot;Adoration of the Mystic Lamb&quot; show groups of approaching knights and judges. Their biblical source can be identified from inscriptions on the panel frames. The far left-hand panels contain lettering reading (&quot;Righteous&quot; (or &quot;Just&quot;) &quot;Judges&quot;), the inside left panel reads (&quot;Warriors of Christ&quot;). The presence of the Judges, none of whom were canonised saints, is an anomaly which art historians have long sought to explain. The most likely explanation is that they refer to Jodocus Vijd&#x27;s position as a city alderman. 
The &quot;Just Judges&quot; may contain portraits of Jan and Hubert as the third and fourth Judges on horseback. The evidence is based on the similarity of one of the figures to Jan&#x27;s 1433 &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot;, now in the National Gallery, London, generally thought to be a self-portrait. The second, closer, figure is thought to be Hubert because of his facial similarity to Jan. Although the judge in the Ghent panel appears to be younger than the sitter in the London painting, they wear similar chaperons with the cornette tightly bound around the bourrelet. The judges in the Ghent panel became the basis for a number of later portraits of the brothers, including that of Dominicus Lampsonius.
=====Flora=====
The Ghent altar shows depictions of herbs, shrubs, (mainly Mediterranean) trees, lichens, mosses and ferns, many of which are so lifelike that orange and pomegranate trees, date palms and cypresses, rose bushes and vines as well as lilies, iris, peonies, lily of the valley, woodruff, daisies, can be identified. This has received scholarly attention for at least two centuries. In 1822 Johanna Schopenhauer identified many of the plants in the flora of the Ghent altar, including medicinal plants A number of them have a connection to the Christian symbolism

In 1984, the ecologist Sam Segal counted 81 different plants. In 1996, German biologist Esther Gallwitz published a plant guide to the flora of the Ghent altar, describing their symbolism and in 2018, the latest critical examination after restoration of the Ghent altar piece found 75 plants, 48 of which could be determined with certainty and 44 of which appear on the panel of the adoration of the lamb, according to the exhibition catalogue.

==Closed view==

The altarpiece measures 375 × 260 cm when the shutters are closed. The upper panels contain lunettes showing prophets and Sibyls looking down on the annunciation; the lower tier shows the donors on the far left and right panels flanked by saints. The exterior panels are executed with relative sparseness in comparison to the often fantastical colour and abundance of the interior scenes. Their settings are earthly, pared down and relatively simple. Yet there is the same striking use of illusionism which also characterises the inner panels; this is especially true of the faux stone grisaille statues of the saints. Lighting is used to great effect to create the impression of depth; van Eyck handles the fall of light and casting of shadow to make the viewer feel as if the pictorial space is influenced or lit by light entering from the chapel in which he stands.
The figures in the lunettes refer to prophecies of the coming of Christ. The far left lunette shows the prophet Zechariah and the far right one shows Micah. The two much taller inner shutters show the Erythraean Sibyl (on the left) and the Cumaean Sibyl on the right. Each panel includes a text inscribed on a floating ribbon or &quot;banderole&quot;, while the identities of the figures are carved on the lower border of each panel. Zechariah&#x27;s text, taken from Zechariah 9:9, reads (&quot;Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion ... behold, your king comes&quot;), while the Erythraean Sibyl&#x27;s words are (&quot;Sounding nothing mortal you are inspired by power from on high&quot;). To the right the Cumaean Sibyl&#x27;s reads (&quot;The Highest King shall come and shall be in the flesh through the ages&quot;).
Zechariah and Micah look down on the fulfilment of their prophecies contained in the banderoles floating behind them. The Erythraean Sibyl is shown observing, while the Cumaean Sibyl, wearing a green dress with thick fur sleeves, gazes down at Mary, her hand held in empathy over her own womb. Micah&#x27;s lunette employs one of the first instances of an illusionistic motif best known from Petrus Christus&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Carthusian&quot; (c.1446), wherein the sense of the boundary between the painting, frame and viewer&#x27;s space becomes blurred. In this instance, the prophet knowingly places his hand outwards on the lower border of the frame.

In October 1428 van Eyck was a member of a Burgundian embassy sent to secure the hand of Isabella,
eldest daughter of John I of Portugal (1385–1433) for Philip. After a storm forced them to spend four weeks in England, the Burgundians arrived in Lisbon in December. In January, they met the King in the castle of Aviz, and van Eyck painted the Infanta&#x27;s portrait, probably in two versions, to accompany the two separate groups who left by sea and by land on 12 February to report the terms to the Duke. The portraits are untraced, but one is preserved in a drawing (Germany, priv. col., see Sterling, fig.), which indicates that Jan used the princess&#x27;s Portuguese dress for the Erythrean sibyl on the Ghent Altarpiece.

In the mid-20th century, art historian Volker Herzner noted the facial similarity between the Cumaean Sibyl and Philip&#x27;s wife Isabella of Portugal, especially as she is portrayed in van Eyck&#x27;s lost 1428–29 betrothal portrait. Herzner speculated that the text in the banderole in the sibyl&#x27;s panel has a double meaning, referring not only to the coming of Christ but also to the 1432 birth of Philip&#x27;s first son and heir to survive infancy. Others reject this idea, given the high rates of infant mortality at the time, and the connotations of bad luck usually associated with acclaiming a son before he is born.

===Annunciation===
Beneath the lunettes are the four panels of the upper register. The two outer panels of the middle register show the Annunciation to Mary, with the Archangel Gabriel on the left and the Virgin Mary on the right. Both are dressed in white robes and occupy what appear to be the opposite ends of the same room. Gabriel and Mary&#x27;s panels are separated by two much narrower images showing unoccupied domestic interior scenes. The back wall in the left-hand image has a window opening onto a view of the street and city square, while that in the right-hand image has a niche. Some art historians have attempted to associate the street with an actual location in Ghent, but it is generally accepted that it is not modelled on any specific place. The sparseness of these narrow panels seems anomalous in the overall context of the altarpiece; a number of art historians have suggested that they were compromises worked out by Jan as he struggled to accommodate his design within the original framework set out by Hubert.

Mary and Gabriel are disproportionately large in relation to the scale of the rooms they occupy. Art historians agree that this follows the conventions of both the International Gothic and late Byzantine traditions of the icon by showing saints, especially Mary, in a much larger scale than their surroundings. In this instance their size is probably a device to convey the idea that they are heavenly apparitions who have come momentarily before the donors who are in the lower register. Van Eyck used this conceit most dramatically in his &quot;Madonna in the Church&quot; (c. 1438–40), which is likely a panel from a dismantled diptych.

Gabriel has blond hair and multicoloured wings. His right hand is raised and in his left he holds lilies, traditionally found in paintings of the annunciation as symbols of Mary&#x27;s virginity. His words to Mary are written alongside him in Latin: (&quot;Hail who art full of grace, the Lord is with you&quot;). The horizontal inscription extends out of the panel and halfway across the neighbouring image. As in van Eyck&#x27;s Washington &quot;Annunciation&quot; of c. 1434–6, the letters of Mary&#x27;s reply are inscribed in reverse and upside-down; as if for God to read from heaven, or for the holy spirit, as represented by the dove, to read as he hovers directly above her. She answers (&quot;Behold the handmaiden of the Lord&quot;).

Art historian Penny Jolly suggests that in the mid to late 1420s Jan may have traveled to Italy at the behest of the Duke of Burgundy where, in Florence, he probably saw an iconic 14th-century annunciation, and perhaps visited more contemporary annunciation scenes. The Florentine annunciations have a number of iconographic similarities to the Ghent panels, including Gabriel&#x27;s multi-colored wings, the upside-down writing, the treatment of light beams, and the separation between angel and virgin by a thin architectural feature. Some of these elements, particularly the spatial separation between the two figures, can be found in Lorenzo Monaco&#x27;s &quot;Bartolini Salimbeni Annunciation&quot; in Santa Trinita, finished before his death in 1424, and one that Jan may have seen. In Monaco&#x27;s painting the angel and Mary are separated by two small spaces, one external and one internal, similar to the city-scape and domestic lavabo panels in the Ghent annunciation.

The style of the furnishings of the room and the modernity of the town visible through the arched window set the panels in a contemporary 15th century setting. The interiors have been cited as one of the first representations of medieval &quot;bourgeois domestic culture&quot;. Borchert sees this familiar setting as a device to allow 15th-century viewers to connect with the panel and so reinforce the conceit that the two saints are apparitions occupying the same space and time as the donor or observer. Yet a number of features in the interior suggest that it is not a secular domestic space, most obviously the cool and austere surfaces, the domed windows, and the stone columns.

The four panels are most obviously connected by the floor tiling and vanishing point. Shadows falling on the tiling at the lower right-hand corner of each panel can only have been cast by the moulding on the frames, that is, from an area outside of the pictorial space.

===Saints and donors===
The figures in the panels on the lower register are positioned within uniform niches. The outer panels show the donors Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut, kneeling and gazing into the distance with their hands clasped together in veneration. The inner panels contain paintings of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. They are rendered in grisaille giving the illusion of sculpture. As with most of the other panels on these wings, they are lit from the right. Shadows thrown by the figures establish depth and bring realism to both the faux statues and their painted niches.

Each saint stands on a stone plinth inscribed with his name. John the Baptist, the son of the priest Zechariah (not to be confused with the prophet of the same name shown on the upper register), holds a lamb in his left arm and is turned towards Joost Vijdt. His right hand is raised and his finger extended to point towards the lamb, a gesture that implies that he is reciting the Agnus Dei. John the Evangelist holds a chalice, a reference to the early medieval tradition that he had ability with cures; he could drink poison from a cup without ill effects.

The donors are painted life-size, and thus to a much larger scale than the saints; this is most noticeable in the relative sizes of their heads and hands. Their bright and warmly coloured clothes contrast sharply with the grey of the lifeless saints. Van Eyck brings a high degree of realism to his portrayal of the Vijdts; his study of the ailing couple in old age is unflinching and far from flattering. Details that reveal their ageing include Joost&#x27;s watering eyes, wrinkled hands, warts, bald head and stubble streaked with grey. The folds of both figures&#x27; skin are meticulously detailed, as are their protruding veins and fingernails. They are generally thought to be among the final panels completed for the altarpiece and are so dated to 1431 or the early months of 1432.

==History==
===Commission===

Jodocus (known as Joos) Vijd was a wealthy merchant and came from a family that had been influential in Ghent for several generations. His father, Vijd Nikolaas (d. 1412), had been close to Louis II of Flanders. Jodocus was one of the most senior and politically powerful citizens of Ghent. He was titled &quot;Seigneur&quot; of Pamele and Ledeberg, and in a difficult and rebellious political climate, became one of the Duke of Burgundy Philip the Good&#x27;s most trusted local councilmen. Around 1398 Jodocus married Lysbette Borluut, also from an established city family.

The couple died childless. Their endowment to the church and the commissioning of the unprecedentedly monumental altarpiece was primarily intended to secure a legacy. But, according to Borchert, also to &quot;secure his position in the hereafter&quot; and, important to such an ambitious politician, demonstrate his social prestige, revealing, according to Borchert, a desire to &quot;show off and ... outstrip by far all other endowments to St John&#x27;s, if not each and every other church and monastery in Ghent.&quot;

Ghent prospered through the early 15th century, and a number of local councillors sought to establish a sense of independence from Burgundian rule. Philip was in financial difficulty and asked the city for revenue, a burden many city councillors felt unreasonable and could ill afford, financially or politically. The situation became tense, and because there was division within the council over the burden, this led to a mistrust that meant council membership was dangerous and precarious. During a power play in 1432, a number of councillors were murdered, seemingly for their loyalty to Philip. Tensions came to with head in a 1433 revolt, which ended with the beheading of the councillors who had acted as ringleaders.

Throughout Vijd stayed loyal to Philip. His position as warden at St. John the Baptist&#x27;s church (now Saint Bavo Cathedral) reflects this; the church was favoured by the Burgundians for official ceremonies held in Ghent. On the day of the altarpiece&#x27;s consecration, 6 May 1432, Philip&#x27;s and Isabella of Portugal&#x27;s son was baptised there, indicating Vijd&#x27;s status at the time.

As warden (&quot;kerkmeester&quot;) of St. John&#x27;s, Vijd between 1410 and 1420 not only financed the construction of the principal chapel&#x27;s bay, but endowed a new chapel near the choir, which took his family name and was regularly to hold masses in his and his ancestors&#x27; memory. It was for this new chapel that he commissioned Hubert van Eyck to create an unusually large and complex polyptych altarpiece. He was recorded as a donor on an inscription on the original, but now lost, frame. The chapel was dedicated to St. John the Baptist, whose traditional attribute is the Lamb of God, a symbol of Christ.

===First major restoration===
The first significant restoration was carried out in 1550 by the painters Lancelot Blondeel and Jan van Scorel, following the earlier and poorly executed cleaning by Jan van Scorel, that led to damage to the predella. The 1550 undertaking was performed with a care and reverence that a contemporary account writes of &quot;such love that they kissed that skilful work in art in many places&quot;. The predella was destroyed by fire in the 16th century. Comprising a strip of small square panels and executed in water based paints, it showed hell or limbo with Christ arriving to redeem those about to be saved. During the Protestant Reformation the piece was moved out of the chapel to prevent damage in the &quot;Beeldenstorm&quot;, first to the attic and later to the town hall, where it remained for two decades. In 1662 the Ghent painter Antoon van den Heuvel was commissioned to clean the Ghent Altarpiece.

===Later history===
The altarpiece has been moved several times over the centuries. Art historian Noah Charney describes the altarpiece as one of the more coveted and desired pieces of art, the victim of 13 crimes since its installation, and seven thefts. After the French Revolution the altarpiece was among a number of art works plundered in today&#x27;s Belgium and taken to Paris where they were exhibited at the Louvre. It was returned to Ghent in 1815 after the French defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.

The painting&#x27;s wings (not including the Adam and Eve panels) were pawned in 1815 by the Diocese of Ghent for the equivalent of £240. When the diocese failed to redeem them, many of them were sold by the dealer Nieuwenhuys in 1816 to the English collector Edward Solly for £4,000 in Berlin. They were sold in 1821 to the King of Prussia, Frederick William III for £16,000, an enormous sum at the time and the highest for a painting at the time and for many decades they were exhibited in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. The panels still in Ghent were damaged by fire in 1822, and the separately hinged Adam and Eve panels sent to a museum in Brussels.

During World War I, other panels were taken from the cathedral by German forces. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and its subsequent reparations transfers, in 1920 Germany returned the pilfered panels, along with the original panels that had been legitimately bought by Solly, to help compensate for other German &quot;acts of destruction&quot; during the war. The Germans &quot;bitterly resented the loss of the panels&quot;. In 1934, &quot;The Just Judges&quot; and &quot;Saint John the Baptist&quot; panels were stolen. The panel of &quot;Saint John the Baptist&quot; was returned by the thief as a goodwill gesture, but the &quot;Just Judges&quot; panel is still missing. Albert Camus in &quot;The Fall&quot; imagines it is kept by the protagonist, Clamence, in his Amsterdam apartment.

In 1940, at the start of another invasion by Germany, a decision was made in Belgium to send the altarpiece to the Vatican to keep it safe during World War II. The painting was &quot;en route&quot; to the Vatican, but still in France, when Italy declared war as an Axis power alongside Germany. The painting was stored in a museum in Pau for the duration of the war, with French, Belgian and German military representatives signing an agreement which required the consent of all three before the masterpiece could be moved. In 1942, Adolf Hitler ordered the painting to be seized and brought to Germany to be stored in the Schloss Neuschwanstein in Bavaria. The seizure, led by senior museum administrator Ernst Buchner and aided by officials in France, was ostensibly to protect the altarpiece from war. After Allied air raids made the castle too dangerous for the painting, it was stored in the Altaussee salt mines, which greatly damaged the paint and varnish. Belgian and French authorities protested the seizing of the painting, and the head of the German army&#x27;s Art Protection Unit was dismissed after he disagreed with the seizure. Following the war, in 1945, the altarpiece was recovered by the Allied group Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program and returned to Belgium in a ceremony presided over by Belgian royalty at the Royal Palace of Brussels, where the 17 panels were displayed for the press. French officials were not invited as the Vichy government had allowed the Germans to remove the painting.

The Belgian art restorer Jef Van der Veken produced a copy of &#x27;The Just Judges&#x27;, as part of an overall restoration effort.

In addition to war damage, the panels were threatened during outbreaks of iconoclasm, and have suffered fire damage.

===Restorations===
Another restoration began in 1950–51, due to damage sustained during the altarpiece&#x27;s stay in the Austrian mines during WWII. In this period, newly developed restoration technology, such as x-ray, was applied to the panels.
A program of restoration at the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent began in October 2012. With a budget of €2.2 million, the project was carried out by the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage (KIK-IRPA). Only the panels being worked on were in the museum at any one time, with the others remained on display in the cathedral. At the museum the public could see the work in progress from behind a glass screen.

The eight outer panels were restored between 2012 and 2016; some 70% of the outer panels&#x27; surface had been overpainted in the 16th century, a subtle discovery made possible by advances in imaging techniques during the 2010s. Mathematician Ingrid Daubechies and a group of collaborators developed new mathematical techniques to both reverse the effects of aging and untangle and remove the effects of past ill-fated conservation efforts. Using highly precise photographs and X-rays of the panels as well as various filtering methods, the team of mathematicians found a way to automatically detect the cracks caused by aging. They were able to decipher the apparent text of the polyptych, which was attributed to Thomas Aquinas.

Restoration of the five lower panels took three years, was completed in January 2020, and they were returned to St Bavo&#x27;s Cathedral. The uncovering of the original face of the Lamb of God was a notable change; the original Lamb has unusually humanoid features, with forward-facing eyes that appear to look directly at the viewer of the panel.

==In popular culture==
The search for the stolen altarpiece near the end of World War II is a major plot point of the 2014 film &quot;The Monuments Men&quot;. The burning of the twelfth panel &quot;Just Judges&quot; is part of the plot of the 2022 book &quot;The Omega Factor&quot; by Steve Berry. It is also mentioned briefly near the end of Albert Camus&#x27;s novel The Fall.

&quot;Altar&quot; on the beach at Ostend
In 1972 Kris Martin, a Belgian conceptual artist who lives and works in Ghent, made For the exhibition &quot;The Sea - Salut d&#x27;honneur Jan Hoet &quot;, Ostende, Oct 23rd, 2014—Apr 19th, 2015 an art installation that resembles the painting

<text>Morelos, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Morelos, is a landlocked state located in south-central Mexico. It is one of the 32 states which comprise the Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 36 municipalities and its capital city is Cuernavaca.

Morelos is bordered by Mexico City to the north, and by the states of México to the northeast and northwest, Puebla to the east and Guerrero to the southwest.

Morelos is the second-smallest state in the nation, just after Tlaxcala. It was part of a very large province, the State of Mexico, until 1869 when Benito Juárez decreed that its territory would be separated and named in honor of José María Morelos y Pavón, who defended the city of Cuautla from royalist forces during the Mexican War of Independence. Most of the state enjoys a warm climate year-round, which is good for the raising of sugar cane and other crops. Morelos has attracted visitors from the Valley of Mexico since Aztec times.

The state is also known for the Chinelos, a type of costumed dancer that appears at festivals, especially Carnival, which is celebrated in a number of communities in the state. It is also home to the Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl, a designated World Heritage Site.

==History==

===Pre-Hispanic period===
Historian Ward Barrett considers that the &quot;region now known as Morelos has a physical unity sufficient to define and set it in strong contrast to other regions of Mexico.&quot; Much of this definition comes from its geography, which is a basin into which abundant water flows. The arrival of the Spanish shifted agriculture from subsistence maize production and cotton cultivation to sugar cane and the refining of such into sugar in nearby mills. This system would remain more or less intact until the Mexican Revolution.

Evidence of the first human inhabitants in what is now Morelos dates back to 6000 B.C. and shows these people as nomadic hunters and gatherers in the areas of Yautepec and &quot;Chimalacatlan&quot;. Other early finds include clay jars and figures in the Gualupita neighborhood of Cuernavaca and three mounds in Santa María Ahuacatitlán, which are probably the remains of houses.

Francisco Plancarte y Navarrete, Cuernavaca&#x27;s second bishop (1898–1911), wrote &quot;Tamoanchan—El Estado de Morelos y El Principio de la Civilizacion en Mexico&quot; in 1911. In it, he proposes that the first agriculturally based settlements in Mexico appeared around 1500 B.C. in a place called &quot;Tamoanchan&quot; which he associates with Morelos. He writes, &quot;1st - That being in the region of Tamoanchan... they fixed the ritual calendar ... 2nd - That Tamoanchan was not very far from Teotihuacan; 3rd - That to go from Tamoanchan to Teotihuacan they passed through Xumiltepec; 4th - That Tepuztecal (sic) and his companions discovered pulque in the Tamoanchan region. But as all these facts happened in... the State of Morelos ... and accordingly that Tamoanchan is not a mythological and fantastic country... but true...&quot;

The earliest identified culture is the Olmec, which was dominant from 200 B. C. to about A.D. 500. Evidence of this culture is found in reliefs such as those in the Cantera Mountain in Chalcatzingo and clay figures.

After the Olmec period, the area was invaded by several waves of migration from the Valley of Mexico in the north. The settlement of Mazatepec was founded in A. D. 603 by the Toltecs. A second wave of Toltecs established the city-state of Xochicalco (the City of Flowers). Their influence is evident in Teotihuacan at the temple of Quetzalcoatl, but there are also signs of Mayan, Mixtec and Zapotec influences. The last wave of Toltecs arrived in the 12th century. There are two groups from this wave. The first to arrive were the Xochimilcas, who settled in places such as Tetela, Hueyapan, Tepoztlán, and &quot;Xumiltepec&quot;. Shortly afterwards the Tlahuicas arrived and settled in and around Cuauhnáhuac (Cuernavaca) by 1250. There is evidence that indicates the &quot;Tlauhuicas&quot; probably would have been expelled from Morelos by the Xochimilcas if they had not been protected by Xólotl, lord of Acolhua, who granted territory to &quot;Tochintecutli&quot;, the first lord of &quot;Cuauhnáhuac&quot; (Cuernavaca). The Tlahuicas are believed to be an offshoot of the Toltec-Chichimec group of Nahuatl-speaking peoples who have occupied the area since the seventh century.

The Tlahuica eventually became the dominant ethnic group in Morelos. They were organized into about fifty small city-states, each with a hereditary ruler (tlatoani). Each Tlahuica city-state consisted of a central town, with its temple, plaza, palace, and the surrounding countryside and villages. The largest of these were &quot;Cuauhnáhuac&quot; and &quot;Huaxtepec&quot; (Oaxtepec). These people had advanced knowledge of astronomy and a highly developed agricultural system. They were especially known for growing cotton, which was planted wherever the land could be irrigated. Tlahuica women spun and wove cloth, which became an important item for exchange and for paying tribute.

The Mexica or Aztec began to arrive as early as 1398, but efforts to dominate this area began in the 1420s. In the 1420s and 1430s, &quot;Cuauhnáhuac&quot; and &quot;Xiutepec&quot; (Jiutepec) were conquered by Itzcoatl. In the middle of the 15th century, other city-states in Morelos made war on Aztec-held Cuauhnahuac and the Aztecs used this as an excuse to conquer areas such as Yautepec, Tetlama and other locations, eventually dominating the entire state. The inclusion of the area into the Aztec Empire was sealed with marriage of Aztec emperor Huitzilihuitl to Miahuaxochitl, daughter of the lord of Cuauhnáhuac. This union produced a son who would become Aztec emperor Moctezuma Ilhuicamina. These conquered areas were allowed to keep their local political structures so long as a tribute, which mostly consisted of cotton items, was paid. The territory was divided into two tributary provinces, one centered on Cuauhnáhuac and the other centered on Huaxtepec. Each of these territories had a population of over 50,000 by the 16th century.

Moctezuma Ilhuicamina succeeded Izcóatl, and tradition has it that he established a botanical garden in Huaxtepec (Oaxtepec). Moctezuma&#x27;s favorite swimming area is thought to have been a pond called &quot;Poza Azul&quot;, now part of a resort run by Six Flags Hurricane Harbor.

The Mexica built a number of fortifications in the area, notably in the hills called &quot;El Sombrerito&quot; and &quot;Tlatoani&quot; near Tlayacapan. The pyramid of Tepozteco in Tepoztlán may have been designed as a fort and lookout post. During this time, the Tlauhuica built the double-pyramid known as Teopanzolco in Cuernavaca.

===Conquest and colonial period===
Population estimates for the beginning of the 16th century are: Cuauhnáhuac, 50,000; Huaxtepec, 50,000; Yautepec, 30,000; Tepoztlán, 20,000; Totolapan, 20,000; and 12,000 each for Tlayacapan, Tetela, Yecapixtla, and Ocuituco.

The Spanish under Hernán Cortés arrived in central Mexico in 1519. After Cortés&#x27;s defeat in Tenochtitlan (La Noche Triste) and retreat into Tlaxacala in 1520, he sent expeditions to Morelos. One of the first Mexicas to accept Spanish authority was in Ocuituco. Gonzalo de Sandoval then set out with 8,000 men for Huaxtepec (Oaxtepec). After a two-day fight, Sandoval returned to Texcoco to inform Cortes of his victory. Cortes returned with 20,000 men and defeated Tlayacapan on April 8. Cortes then went to Huaxtepec, spent a night in the beautiful gardens, and moved on to Yautepec. The Spanish burned the town, and Tepoztlan surrendered. Cortes continued his march on Xiutepec (Jiutepec) and on April 13 faced the city of Cuauhnahuac (Cuernavaca). The bridges across the Ravine of Annanalco had been destroyed, but both Cortes and Bernal Diaz del Castillo relate how they were able to cross the ravine upriver via a fallen tree. The &quot;cacique&quot; of Cuauhnahuac surrendered quickly, and Cortes burned and sacked the city, and the women were raped. After spending the night in nearby Acapantzingo, Cortes moved on to &quot;Coajomulco&quot; before marching on Xochimilco. Cortes returned to Cuernavaca after the fall of Tenochtitlan, where he established a hacienda and constructed the Palace of Cortés five years later.

Only two years after the fall of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), in the year 1523, the first church was built in &quot;Tlatenango&quot;, and over the next 50 years 500 religious constructions were built in the state.

In 1529, Cortés was named the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, which gave him control over of territory in Morelos with Cuernavaca as the seat of authority over about eighty communities, eight haciendas, and two sugar cane plantations. These lands stayed in the Cortés family until 1809 when the government confiscated all of the lands of the Marquis. There are house-to-house censuses from the mid-1530s from communities around Cuernavaca that are the earliest extant local-level documentation in Nahuatl, likely due to a dispute between Cortés and the crown about the number of tributaries of the Marquesado del Valle de Oaxaca. These Indigenous censuses make it possible to establish an early colonial-era base-line for household structure, land holding, tribute obligations, and rates of baptism and Church marriage.

===Independence to end of 19th century===

The conditions on the sugar plantations of Morelos made Father Miguel Hidalgo&#x27;s call to take up arms well received by the indigenous and mestizo populations of the state. The first rebellions broke out in 1811, with some early successes. An early insurgent leader in the state was Francisco Ayala. Insurgents from the state managed to push as far as Chalco in what is now Mexico State when royalist forces pushed them back in 1812. After Hidalgo was executed (July 30, 1811), José María Morelos y Pavon took over the insurgent effort, joined by Mariano Matamoros of Jantetelco.

By 1812, insurgents had control of the city of Cuautla, and royalist forces began to put it under siege. Morelos and his men held out for 58 days when reinforcement arrived, breaking the Siege of Cuautla. This was one of the early vital wins for the insurgent movement. Morelos would eventually be captured by royalists and executed in 1815, but the memory of this battle would lead to the future state being named after him.

In the post-war period, the sugar industry of Morelos made this region one of the richest parts of the Mexican Republic. Much of this sugar made its way to European markets. As a result, the city of Cuernavaca, serving as an important trade center for exports, became a well-established outpost along the Camino Real (Royal Road) to Acapulco. But the sugar cane estates were worlds unto themselves: great luxury for the (often absentee) owners and misery, debt, and poverty for the workers.

After winning independence, what is now the state of Morelos was the district of Cuernavaca as part of the very large State of Mexico, created in 1824. The entity would change status between state and department depending on whether liberal or conservative factions were in charge. Under the Constitution of 1857, the State of Mexico and all other states would keep their federal status permanently.

Cuernavaca gained the title of city in 1834. During the Mexican–American War, this city was taken by the Americans under General Cadwalader.

The next conflict was the uprising against President Antonio López de Santa Anna under the Plan of Ayutla in 1854. Armed rebellion broke out in Cuautla, and Santa Anna responded by burning entire villages. However, the rebellion dislodged Santa Anna, naming Juan Álvarez as president. Alvarez moved the Mexican capital to Cuernavaca. A new constitutional convention was called and when the 1857 Constitution was proclaimed, Alvarez retired and the capital moved back to Mexico City.

The new constitution did not stop fighting among conservative and liberal factions in Mexico, which escalated again into the Reform War from 1858 to 1861. While Cuautla was a liberal bastion, Cuernavaca was a stronghold for the conservatives; roamed by bandits who burned and destroyed the haciendas of Pantitlán and Xochimancas, terrorizing villagers. Ignacio Manuel Altamirano wrote a novel, set in Yautepec, about the war and the bandits, called &quot;El Zarco: Episodios de la Vida Mexicana en 1861–63&quot;. The war ended on January 11, 1861, when Benito Juárez took control of Mexico City.

The division between the liberal and conservative parts of the state remained through the French Intervention in Mexico. When the French Army invaded Mexico, Francisco Leyva raised an army in Morelos to fight in the Battle of Puebla of May 5, 1862. Despite the heroic efforts on that day, the French eventually managed to gain control of the country and install Maximilian of Habsburg as emperor in 1864. Maximilian chose the &quot;Jardin Borda&quot; in Cuernavaca as his summer residence, and he built &quot;La Casa del Olindo&quot; in Acapantzingo, Cuernavaca supposedly for Margarita Leguizmo Sedano, his mistress known as &quot;La India Bonita.&quot; The French emperor improved the roads from Mexico City to Cuernavaca; telegraph service between the two began in 1866. However, resistance to French rule was well underway. On January 1, 1867, Republican troops under the leadership of &quot;Francisco Leyva, Ignacio Figueroa&quot;, and &quot;Ignacio Manuel Altamirano&quot; began an eight-day siege of Cuernavaca. France, under Napoleon III, withdrew its troops soon after that, and Maximilian was defeated by Republican forces and executed.

After the French were expelled by forces under Benito Juárez, there were efforts to divide the State of Mexico. This resulted in the approval of the state of Morelos on September 21, 1868, by the federal Congress, followed by the official admittance of Morelos as the country&#x27;s 27th state on April 17, 1869. The territory of the state was the Third Military District of the State of Mexico as defined by the Juárez government; the name &quot;Morelos&quot; and the capital &quot;Cuernavaca&quot; were selected by the state&#x27;s first legislature. The first state constitution was finalized in 1870, and Francisco Leyva Arciniegas became the first Constitutional Governor of Morelos. There were boundary disputes between the new state with Mexico State and the Federal District, but these were resolved by the 1890s.

A telegraph line from Mexico City to Cuernavaca had been laid between 1867 and 1869; in 1870 it was extended to Iguala, Chilpancingo, and Tixla. Another line, between Cuernavaca and Cuautla, was laid in 1875. Attempts were made to improve education, but limited funds made that virtually impossible. Other infrastructure projects in the late 19th century included the Toluca-Cuernavaca highway, and a rail line between Mexico City and Cuautla. 200 people died when a train plunged into the San Antonio River at the &quot;Puente de Escontzin&quot; (Escontzin Bridge) near Cuautla in what became known as the Morelos railway accident on June 23, 1881. Rail lines would continue to be built into the 20th century, connecting the state further with Mexico City and the Pacific Ocean. On May 11, 1874, the capital was moved to Cuautla; it was returned to Cuernavaca on January 1, 1876.

During the long presidency of Porfirio Diaz (1877–1911), the economy of Morelos continued to be dominated by the large sugar plantations. The sugar cane estates were modernized and began to use steam-driven mills and centrifugal extractors. These changes created a great new demand for the water and land resources needed to grow sugar cane. As a result, the haciendas expanded steadily, but only at the expense of the peasants, who were unfairly deprived of their land by the hacienda owners. Between 1884 and 1905, eighteen towns in Morelos disappeared as lands were taken by the haciendas.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Cuernavaca was established in 1894 with Fortino Hipólito Vera as the first bishop (1894–1898). He was followed by Francisco Plancarte y Navarrete (1898–1911).

===Revolution and 20th century===

====Díaz, Madero and Zapata====

This situation made the state ripe for the Mexican Revolution and the base for one of the best-known revolutionaries from this period, Emiliano Zapata, who was born in Anenecuilco, Ciudad Ayala. Some of the first outbreaks of violence took place in Cuernavaca under Genovevo de la O from Santa María Ahuacatitlán in 1910. Zapata&#x27;s victory in the bloody Battle of Cuautla (May 11–19, 1911) brought about Porfirio Diaz&#x27;s abdication, but also led to the press labeling Zapata &quot;the Attila of the South&quot;. But then, Government forces led by Victoriano Huerta attacked towns and cities in the state, trying to take it back. Shortly afterwards, on August 17, revolutionaries sacked Jojutla.

Zapata felt betrayed by Francisco Madero, and following Madero&#x27;s election as president on November 6, 1911, Zapata and his followers called for agrarian reform in the Plan de Ayala. Contrary to popular belief, the state&#x27;s motto, &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot; (Land and Liberty) did not originate with Zapata or the Plan de Ayala; it was first used by Ricardo Flores Magón in the magazine &quot;Regeneración&quot; on October 1, 1910.

With the outbreak of Revolution, a new bishop, Manuel Fulcheri y Pietrasanta was chosen to head the Roman Catholic diocese (May 6, 1912 - April 21, 1922)

====Zapata and Huerta====
Madero was assassinated; Victoriano Huerta took over the government, but he was soon put on the run. In May 1914, Zapata, with a force of 3,600 men, took control of the southern Jojutla district. By this time, Cuernavaca was the only important town in Morelos that the Federal forces held onto. It took 72 days to take Cuernavaca, after which he marched on Milpa Alta (Mexico City).

====Zapata and Carranza====

Huerta was defeated, and 1915 was fairly peaceful in Morelos. However, by December 1915, Zapata was forced to fight a new enemy—Venustiano Carranza. Carranza embarked upon an offensive that retook significant parts of the state of Morelos. By the spring of 1916, Zapata was forced to abandon several of his strongholds. The biggest loss came on May 2, 1916, when Zapata lost Cuernavaca to enemy forces, which now numbered some 30,000 troops. As Zapata continued to lose ground, his forces were forced to return to the guerilla warfare that they had waged a few years earlier. They retook Cuernavaca in January, 1916, but he generally lost ground to the &quot;Constitutionalists&quot;. The Zapatistas imposed a heavy tax on haciendas; when the owners refused to pay, the rebels burned the cane fields such as those of Chinameca, Tenango, Treinta, Atilhuayan, Santa Iñes, and San Gabriel. Then, on April 17, 1919, Zapata was betrayed and ambushed at Chinameca. Zapata&#x27;s remains are currently in Cuautla at the foot of a statue erected in his honor.

When the Constitutionalists split and Minister of War Álvaro Obregón was forced to flee, he and Zapata&#x27;s chief of staff and successor Gildardo Magaña joined forces and defeated Carranza. Obregón&#x27;s government duly reciprocated with legislating a land reform in Morelos according to the Plan de Ayala principles.

====1920 to 1966====

In 1926 President Plutarco Elias Calles ordered a number of restrictions on the Catholic Church, precipitating the so-called Cristero War. While the Catholic Church generally opposed the Mexican Revolution, many former &quot;Zapatistas&quot; joined the rebellion in Morelos. Groups led by Benjamin Mendoza in Coatlán del Río; Nicolas Zamora in Tetlama, Temixco; and Rafael Castañada in Alpuyeca, Xochitepec, joined the Cristeros. They were quickly put down by Governor Ambrosia Punte in 1927.

Since the Revolution, the state&#x27;s history has centered on development and crime. There were several assaults along the Mexico City-Cuernavaca highway in 1928 and again in 1934. There was a train robbery in 1928, and several major train accidents in the 1930s. The statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe in &quot;El Calvario&quot; (Cuernavaca) was destroyed by vandals in 1934. Striking police went of a crime wave in 1937. Five thousand rioters protested when the Cuernavaca police killed Jorge Garrigós in 1957. The municipal president of Jiutepec was assassinated on May 26, 1958. In 1960, three government officials in Cuernavaca were fired because of embezzlement.

From 1943 to 1944, and again from 1953 to 1958, Rubén Jaramillo led peasant revolts against the government. Despite promises and a guarantee of his safety from presidents Manuel Ávila Camacho in 1944 and Adolfo López Mateos in 1958, Jaramillo was gunned down in Xochicalco by federal police on May 23, 1962. A cache of weapons was discovered in &quot;Colonia Rubén Jaramillo&quot;, Temixco, in September 1973.

As for development, Morelos adopted a new Constitution on November 20, 1930. Gambling was outlawed and the &quot;Casino de la Selva&quot; in Cuernavaca was closed in 1934, which had been a mecca for American mobsters and Hollywood film stars. The Buenavista-Tepoztlán highway was built in 1936, and the Mexico City-Cuernavaca tollway opened in 1952. Highway construction eventually led to the closing of a number of rail lines including the Mexico City-Cuernavaca-Iguala line in 1963.

Datsun began manufacturing automobiles in Jiutepec in 1961. The first industrial park of Morelos, &quot;Civac&quot; (Industrial City of the Valley of Cuernavaca), opened in 1966, confiscating of communal land in Tejalpa, Jiutepec with virtually no compensation. &quot;Mayekewa&quot; and &quot;Nissan&quot; were among the first companies to locate there.

A major water park with capacity for 20,000 visitors, was opened in Oaxtepec by IMSS (Mexican Social Security Institution) in 1966. When Mexico hosted the XIX 1968 Summer Olympics, the Junior Games were in Oaxtepec. The water park was sold to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor in 2016.

There were two major disasters in 1962: in March, a bus fell off a cliff near the Lagunas de Zempoala National Park in Huitzilac, killing 22 and injuring 36. An earthquake in Cuernavaca in May killed 22, injured dozens, and destroyed two buildings.

Four Roman Catholic bishops served during this period: Francisco Uranga y Sáenz (April 21, 1922 - 8 July 8, 1930), Francisco María González y Arias (January 30, 1931 - 20 August 20, 1946), Alfonso Espino y Silva (August 2, 1947 - May 15, 1951), and Sergio Méndez Arceo † (11 March 11, 1952 - December 28, 1982). Mendez Arceo He is remembered as the force behind the growth of basic ecclesial communities (Spanish: Comunidades Eclesiales de Base) (CEB) in Mexico during the 1970s, for his support of Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich and his &quot;Centro Intercultural de Documentación&quot; (English: Intercultural Documentation Center), and as a supporter of both human rights and liberation theology. Mendez Arceo was also responsible for the restoration and remodeling of the Cuernavaca Cathedral that led to the discovery of the murals about St. Philip of Jesus and companions.

====1967 to 2000====

As it has been since Aztec times, the state, especially Cuernavaca, has been a favorite retreat for those in Mexico City due to its warm year-round climate. That, plus pollution and the September 19, 1985 Mexico City earthquake, have spurred a major housing boom which continues to this day. Most of this boom is centered on the city of Cuernavaca but also Cuautla and other places.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the major crime problem was kidnapping for ransom. The kidnapping crime wave caused investment in the state to drop from a high of US$245 million in 1999 to $102 million in 2002, with the state lagging behind the country in job creation. The state broke the kidnapping rings in the early 2000s, mostly by arresting corrupt lawyers, police, and judges who were protecting kidnapping rings, includes one run by Daniel &quot;Mocha Orejas&quot; Arizmendi, who received his nickname by cutting off his victims&#x27; ears and sending them to family members. The busts brought the kidnapping rate to below national average. Governor Jorge Carrillo Olea (1994–1998) was forced to resign after being accused of covering for kidnappers.

Roman Catholic bishops during this era were Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo (December 28, 1982 - May 15, 1987) and Luis Reynoso Cervantes (August 17, 1987 - December 20, 2000).

===21st century===

====2000 to 2009====
The kidnapping problems have been replaced with violence related to the drug trade, despite the fact that Morelos is far from the U.S. border. The 2009 slaying of kingpin Arturo Beltrán Leyva set off a turf war for his successor. It has increased the number of gun battles and gangland-style executions. Anonymous email threats succeed in keeping people away from Cuernavaca at night, with bars and nightclubs closing when such communications threaten drug violence. In 2004, Governor Sergio Estrada ordered the mass firing of all of the state police officers after top police commanders were arrested on charges that they were working with drug traffickers. This caused a major political battle for the governor, who then himself was accused of cooperating with drug rings, with attempts to take him out of office. The area around Lagunas de Zempoala National Park, on Morelos&#x27;s border with Mexico City, is one of Mexico&#x27;s 16 most dangerous regions, in part due to the narcotics trade.

The state is considered to be one of the most dangerous, despite its small size and population. Most crime is centered in Cuernavaca. Its crime rate surpasses that of Mexico City in terms of crimes per 1,000 people. It is over 50% higher than the national average. Although Cuernavaca has only 21% of the population, it suffers 45% of the crime committed in the state. There are a number of possible causes. Some blame the judicial system for being inept and there are strong links to the drug trafficking trade, en route to Mexico City.

====2010 to 2019====

In the election of July 1, 2018, the coalition &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot; won the governorship (Cuauhtémoc Blanco) and 16 of 33 municipalities, PRD-PSD won 4, PAN-MC won 3, PRI won 2, PVEM won 4, Nueva Alianca won 2, and Humanista won 1.

On December 30, 2018, the newly formed National Guard took over police functions in Cuernavaca, Jiutepec, and Yautepec.

Starting January 1, 2019, three new &quot;municipios&quot; were created in Morelos: Xoxocotla; Hueyapan; and Coatetelco. All three are Indigenous communities that will have increased autonomy.

The federal government held a referendum on February 23−24, 2019, to decide whether to build a thermoelectric plant and a gas pipeline in Huexca, Yecapixtla. Voters in Morelos and parts of the states of Puebla and Tlaxcala were asked if they supported the completion of $22 billion peso (U.S.$1.6 billion) plant completed in September 2017 but not put into operation due to lack of connection to the Cuautla River. Two opponents of the plant, Ruben Fajardo and Samir Flores Soberanes were murdered and there were violent protests during the public consultation. 59.5% of the 55,715 citizens voted in favor of construction, and 40.1% voted against. A number of safety and environmental factors have not yet been resolved.

A 10:00 a.m. on May 8, 2019 shooting in downtown Cuernavaca left two dead and two injured. The shooting occurred during a demonstration by merchants who do not have fixed addresses. Governor Cuauhtemoc Blanco has cited the need for support from the National Guard to combat violence in the state. This comes three months after a shooting in &quot;Bar Sofia,&quot; which left one dead and nine injured, and the police chief was replaced.

;Earthquakes of September, 2017
Morelos was hit by two strong earthquakes in September 2017. On September 7, the 2017 Chiapas earthquake did some serious shaking in Morelos although no physical damage or injuries were reported in Morelos. The second, on September 19, 2017 was disastrous in Morelos. The epicenter was 12 kilometers southeast of Axochiapan, at a depth of 57 kilometers. Seventy-five people died in Morelos, principally in Jojutla and in the eastern part of the state; 200 people were hospitalized, 5,000 homes, 10 hospitals, 186 schools, and 4 dams were damaged. The 11 municipalities most affected were Jojutla, Axochiapan, Cuernavaca, Miacatlán, Tlayacapan, Xochitepec, Yautepec, Jantetelco, Ocuituco, Yecapixtla, and Emiliano Zapata. In Cuernavaca, 4 people were killed, the landmark &quot;Torre Latinoamericana&quot; collapsed, and 11 churches were damaged.

As the citizens of Mexico and of Morelos, as well as foreign governments, rushed to help those affected, Governor Graco Ramírez and his wife, Elena Cepeda de Leon, head of &quot;DIF Morelos&quot; (Department of Children and Families) were accused of deviating at least two large trucks of supplies for political purposes. The governor and his wife denied the allegations, explaining that they were simply organizing the delivery. However, they never explained why all the food and other supplies were labeled as if they had come from DIF Morelos rather than their true places of origin.

The ISSSTE hospital in Zapata was forced to work on the street for two months, and the Hospital Parres in Cuernavaca was unserviceable for a year after the earthquake. Over a year later, people in Jojutla were still homeless.

====2020 to 2029====
32 of the 36 mayors of municipalities in the state demonstrated in the &quot;Zócalo&quot; against Governor Cuauhtémoc Blanco on February 1, 2020. They were demanding the restoration of MXN $1,000,000,000 (US $50 million) in federal funds to pay for police.

Roman Catholic bishops of the 21st century have been: Florencio Olvera Ochoa (February 22, 2002 - July 10, 2009), Alfonso Cortés Contreras (July 10, 2009 - 22 December 22, 2012), and Ramón Castro Castro (May 15, 2013 – present). In March 2020, Castro Castro blessed the 2020 census workers as the Roman Catholic population in Mexico decreases.

Morelos had its first case of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico in mid-March, about the same time that Mexico entered Phase 2 of the pandemic and schools were closed. Drugstores in Cuernavaca reported shortages of masks, antibacterial gel, and other items. The first death was on March 28, a 37-year-old man who had traveled to Italy. President López Obrador and Governor Blanco dedicated the ISSSTE hospital “Carlos Calero” in Cuernavaca, set aside to care for patients with COVID-19. As of May 17, 2020, there were 153 deaths and 1,105 confirmed cases in the state. 158 health workers contracted the virus and two died. 46% of the cases were treated at hospitals run by &quot;Servicios de Salud de Morelos&quot; (SSM), 38% by the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), 13% by the Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE), and 1% by private hospitals. The federal government announced it would pay the families of health workers who died because of the virus MXN $50,000. Morelos passed 2,000 confirmed cases on June 14 and continued in ′′Semaforo Rojo′′ (Maximum Alert) until June 21. The state health department reported that the first 9,759 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the state for application in health workers on January 12, 2021. Four bottles containing twenty doses were stolen from “Carlos Calero Elorduy Hospital” run by SEDENA two days later. After an increase in 1,000 serious cases in three days in January 2021, G. Parres and Carlos Calero hospitals in Cuernavaca as well as the COVID-19 hospitals in Jojutla and Axochiapan reported they were full to 100% capacity. ISSSTE in Zapata reported 90% of its beds were occupied. Radamés Salazar Solorio, senator from MORENA, died of COVID-19 on February 21. Temixco became the first municipality to vaccinate senior citizens (60+) with 15,170 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine.

Twenty-one people died in May 2020 after drinking homemade alcohol in the eastern part of the state. A baby boy was registered using the surnames (Spanish: &quot;apellidos&quot;) of both his birth mother and her wife in May 2020, the first such case in Morelos. IMSS reported that 10,000 doses of flu vaccine were stolen from its hospital in eastern Morelos on October 12, 2020.

Nineteen political parties registered for the 2021 Mexican legislative election in Morelos. They are: PSD, MORENA, PT, PAN, MC, PRI, Panal, PRD, PES, PVEM, PH, Sumando Voluntades Podemos Construir, Más Más Apoyo Social, Morelos Progresa, Movimiento Alternativa Social, Bienestar Ciudadano, Renovación Política Morelense, Fuerza, Trabajo u Unidad por el Rescate Oportuno de Morelos, and Morelos Fuerza.

==Geography==
The state is located in the center of the country and has an area of , accounting for 0.25% of Mexico&#x27;s total territory. It is the second smallest state after Tlaxcala. It shares borders with the Federal District of Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Guerrero, and Puebla. The state&#x27;s capital is Cuernavaca. It was the largest city of the Tlahuicas and originally called Cuauhnahuac, but the Spanish changed it to the current name which means &quot;Cow Horn&quot; in Spanish. This city is only 90 km south of Mexico City and due to its gentle climate is referred to as &quot;The City of the Eternal Spring.&quot;

Morelos, most of which is between above sea level, has a very diverse topography: 42% is mountainous, 16% hilly land, and 42% flat terrain. The highest altitudes are found near the state&#x27;s border with Mexico City, and the lowest are found in the Huaxtla region. The state straddles two main geographic formations, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the north and east and the Sierra Madre del Sur, which stretches south and west from Cuernavaca and Jiutepec. The majestic mountain peaks of the Sierra Ajusco in the north of the state divide Morelos from the neighboring Valley of Mexico.

The state is in the highest part of the Balsas River basin, which ends in the north in the areas bounded by the Sierra Ajusco-Chichinautzin and the Popocatépetl volcano. From this point south, the state gradually slopes downward, interrupted by the Tlaltizapan and Yautepec mountains in the center of the state and the Sierra de Huautla in the south. Most of the rivers and streams of the state, including the Cuautla River, flow into the Amacuzac River on the border with the state of Guerrero, which itself is a major tributary of the Balsas River.

The climate and vegetation varies from alpine meadows in the highest elevations near Popocatepetl to lowland rainforest in the south. Roughly 70% of the state has a humid and relatively warm climate, especially in the highly populated areas of Cuernavaca, Tepotzlán, Oaxtepec and Yautepec. Average temperature is approximately year-round, with a rainy season from May until September.

The climates can be further subdivided: hot and semi-humid; semi-hot and semi-humid; temperate and semi-humid; semi-cold and semi-humid; and cold. The hot and semi-humid climate covers about 78% of the state&#x27;s territory, with an average temperature of , with rains in the summer. This area presents mostly subtropical-rainforest-type vegetation. The semi-hot and semi-humid climate can be found in a strip in the north of the state and accounts for 13% of the territory. Average temperature varies between 18 and 22 degrees Celsius, with rains in the summer and a dry season in the winter. A temperate and semi-humid climate covers about 10% of the territory and is found in the north of the state around the municipalities of Huitzilac, Tlanepantla, Totolapan, Tetela del Volcán and parts of Cuernavaca, Tepoztlan, Ocuituco, Tlayacapan and Miacatlán. This area has an average temperature of between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius, with mixed forests of pine and holm oak. A semi-cold and semi-humid climate accounts for only 2% of the territory and found along the borders of the Federal District, Mexico State, and Puebla. This area has pine forests and some alpine meadows. The coldest climate is found in the upper parts of Popocatepetl that belong to the state. Average temperature here is less than 5 degrees Celsius with frequent freezes. Most of the vegetation is alpine meadow or moss.

The natural resources of the state have been taken advantage of for centuries and have suffered changes as a consequence, especially in landscapes, water sources, flora, and fauna. This change accelerates as the population grows. The state has one major national park, the Lagunas de Zempoala. It is one of Mexico&#x27;s largest national parks, located on the southern flank of the Sierra Madre mountains. The park had five mountain-fed lakes and abundant wildlife when the park was established in 1937. This park is being stressed due to illegal logging, with subsequent soil erosion and water from its last dark blue lake to drainage. Much of this drainage is to provide water to Cuernavaca, whose population uses 785 liters of water per day per person, twice that of Mexico City. The park&#x27;s area has shrunk from to 12,500.

Much of the state&#x27;s ecological woes stem from the housing explosion, which is mostly centered in the capital of Cuernavaca, but it is a problem in places such as Cuautla as well. Groups such as the Frente de Pueblos en Defensa de la Tierra y el Agua and Guardianes de los Àrboles have criticized the government for allowing city areas to grow with insufficient planning and control. They also claim that it is hurting much of the state&#x27;s ecosystem and water supply.

Morelos has 39 open-pit mines covering an area of , mostly in Temixco, Miacatlan, Xocitepec, and Cuernavaca. Mines of this sort often affect the health of both miners and people who live in nearby communities; they threaten the air, water supply, and soil in addition to the flora and fauna of the community. The Canadian company Alamos Gold has a concession to mine the &quot;cerro del Jumil&quot; which threatens the subsoil of the Xochicalco archaeological site.

Mexico is located near the North American, Pacific, Cocos, Rivera, and Caribbean Tectonic Plates, making the country highly susceptible to earthquakes. According to the &quot;Servicio Sismológico Nacional&quot; (SSN), there have been over 1,000 earthquakes near the borders of Morelos and Puebla State since 1900.

==Demographics==

Morelos is the second-smallest state and ranks 25 out of 32 states in population, with 1.6% of Mexico&#x27;s total population. However, it is ranked third in population density after Mexico City and the State of Mexico. 86% of the population lives in urban areas with only 14% in rural areas. Nationally, the figures are 76% and 24%. Just under 60% of the state&#x27;s population lives in seven municipalities, which are Cuernavaca, Jiutepec, Temixco, Cuautla, Yautepec, Jojutla and Ayala. The most heavily populated area of the state is the city of Cuernavaca and its metropolitan area, with 21.95% of the total population. It is followed by the urban area of Cuautla-Yautepec-Ayala with just under 20%.

The state has had a higher than average population increase since the mid-1990s at about 4%. In some areas, population growth has been very high at points, such as in Jiutepec (over 21%) and Emiliano Zapata (over 15%). Much of this growth has been in the main cities of Cuernavaca, Cuautla, Ayala and Yautepec. This growth has meant the loss of the state&#x27;s ability to feed itself, with less than 40% of grains consumed grown inside Morelos. Population growth has also put a strain on infrastructure such as water, sewer, potable water, electricity, roads, and schools.

The Catholic religion dominates, but there are significant minorities of evangelical Protestants and those of the Jewish faith.

The indigenous population of the state is estimated at 8%, just under the national average of 10%. However, only 2% of the population is counted as speaking an indigenous language compared to 7% nationally. The total counted in 2005 by INEGI was 24,757.
Historically, various Nahua peoples have dominated the state. This population severely diminished during the colonial period and again during the Porfiriato (late 19th and early 20th centuries), when many indigenous peasants were sent to other parts of the country to work. Those considered to be ethnically indigenous are located in 33 municipalities with most concentrated in 15 of these. Many identify as Mixtec, Tlapaneco and Zapotec who have immigrated from Puebla, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. Most of those who identify as Nahua are native to the state. Many of the immigrant indigenous are migrant workers, traveling among fields of sugar cane, corn, tomatoes, and onions. Some return to their home states in the off-season and some remain permanently in Morelos.

While indigenous languages have largely disappeared since the Conquest, many old customs and traditions continue to live on as part of many people&#x27;s identity. Many ethnic Nahuas conserve much of their ancient knowledge, such as dances, music, agricultural practices, and rituals, although most are mixed with Catholic and moderns beliefs and practices. Since Mexico&#x27;s census only counts the indigenous by language spoken and not by ethnicity, it is not possible to be sure of the precise number of Nahua in Morelos. Between 32 and 35 communities in the state have been identified as being &quot;indigenous&quot; based on prevailing customs and tradition. However, this does not take into account migrant workers or who have immigrated to the state from other parts of Mexico. In 2020, 37,569 people were counted as speaking an indigenous language, with the municipalities of Cuautla, Cuernavaca, Ayala, Puente de Ixtla, Temixco, and Tetela del Volcàn having the highest number of speakers.

Of the eleven municipalities which are classified as highly marginalized economically, only three have a significant indigenous population (Temoac, Miacatlán and Tetela del Volcán). However, within larger municipalities such as Cuernavaca and Jiutepec, indigenous communities tend to be highly marginalized. Coatetelco, Hueyapan, and Xoxocotla were established as autonomous indigenous communities in 2019.

According to the 2020 Census, 1.94% of Morelos&#x27; population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

==Government==

The state is governed by an elected governor, who has a cabinet with four departments called &quot;Policy, Security and Justice,&quot; &quot;Human and Social Development,&quot; &quot;Sustainable Economic Development&quot; and &quot;Development and Modernization of the Administration.&quot;. The state Congress in is charge of passing laws and revising those already in existence. It is unicameral with twenty &quot;deputies&quot; (diputados) representing twelve districts and eight &quot;plurinominales&quot; elected by proportion in 2018. The deputies of the 54th legislature are: 1. Alejandra Flores Espinoza (Morena), 2. Javier García Chávez (Morena), 3. José Casas González (PT), 4. Erika García Zaragoza (PT), 5. Andrés Duque Tinoco (PES), 6. Ariadna Barrera Vázquez (Morena), 7. Marcos Zapotitla Becerro (Morena), 8. Elsa Delia González Solórzano (Morena), 9. Keila Celene Figueroa Evaristo (Morena), 10. José Luis Galindo Cortez (PT), 11. Alfonso de Jesús Sotelo Martinez (PES), 12. Maricela Jiménez Armendáriz (PES). Plurinominales: Tania Valentina Rodríguez Ruiz (PT), Rosalina Mazari Espín (PRI), Dalila Morales Sandoval (PAN), Ana Cristina Guevara Ramírez (MC), Blanca Nieves Sánchez Arano (Panal), Naida Josefina Díaz Roca (PSD), Cristina Xochiquetzal Sánchez Ayala (Humanist), and Rosalinda Rodríguez Tinoco (PRD).

The state opened a new legislative palace on February 28, 2018. Located in Amatitlan, Cuernavaca, it occupies 4,394 m2 (47,000 ft.2) of construction and was built at a cost of $360 million pesos (US$18.9 million). The building was designed by students of the College of Architecture of the University of Morelos (UAEM).

===Governors of Morelos===
Morelos had seven governors between 1869 (when the state was formed) and 1911 (when the Madero Revolution triumphed). Francisco Leyva Arciniegas was the first Constitutional governor (1869–1876).

Thirty-four men held the highest administrative position in Morelos between 1911 and 1930. Their titles included &quot;Constitutional Governor&quot;, &quot;Substitute Governor&quot;, &quot;Provisional Governor&quot;, &quot;Temporary Governor&quot;, &quot;Military Governor&quot;, &quot;Political head of Territory&quot;, and &quot;In charge of office&quot;. General Genovevo de la O, and José G. Parres Guerrero are the best-known names. Octavio Paz Solórzano, father of the poet by the same name, served briefly in 1925.

Twenty men have served as governor during the Constitutional Period. Vicente Estrada Cajigal (PNR, 1930–1934) was the first Constitutional governor after the Revolution. 
Felipe Rivera Crespo (PRI, 1970–1976) is remembered for his support of agriculture.
Lauro Ortega Martínez (PRI, 1982–1988) is credited with improving the highway of &quot;Cañon de Lobos&quot;, saving the town of Huautla, and building the &quot;Mariano Matamoros&quot; soccer stadium.
Antonio Riva Palacio López (PRI, 1988–1994) was the last member of PRI to serve a full six-year term as Governor of Morelos. After he completed his term, he was appointed ambassador to Ecuador (1994–1998), despite being accused of literally hundreds of charges of corruption. Jorge Carrillo Olea (PRI, 1994–1998) was forced to resign after being accused of covering for kidnappers. Carrillo was followed by two interim governors, and then Sergio Alberto Estrada Cajigal Ramirez of PAN was elected in 2000. Estrada Cajigal is the grandson of Vicente Estrada Cajigal, first governor elected under the 1930 constitution, and he was the first governor who was not a member of PRI or its predecessor, PNR. The younger Estrada Cajigal is best remembered for the &quot;Helicopter of Love&quot; bought with government funds for emergency use but actually used to impress his mistresses. His term ended in 2006 and he resigned from PAN in 2009. Marco Antonio Adame (PAN, 2006–2012) followed. Adame&#x27;s term of office was marked by extreme violence, and he was accused of not only having ties to drug cartels, but also of electoral fraud.

After 70 years of corruption under PRI and eight under PAN, voters turned left and chose Graco Luis Ramírez Garrido Abreu (PRD 2012–2018). However, by 2017, he was called the worst governor in the country, with an 8% approval rating. He was accused of nepotism (his stepson ran for governor in 2018), incompetence (for the high rate of crime in the state and because of a poorly built expressway), and for deviation of funds (bankrupting the state university). Cuauhtémoc Blanco, the &quot;Presidente Municipal&quot; of Cuernavaca and a former soccer star with Liga MX, most notably with Club América, won with 53.3% of the vote in a six-way race in 2018. Blanco was the nominee of the now-defunct, Christian right Social Encounter Party (PES), which capitalized on Blanco&#x27;s popularity as a former soccer player to win both the internal election of the &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot; coalition (spearheaded by National Regeneration Movement&#x27;s leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador) for the state&#x27;s candidacy and, ultimately, the state election. Blanco&#x27;s term is scheduled to end in 2024.

===Political divisions of state===

Morelos is currently subdivided into 36 &quot;municipios&quot; (municipalities). On November 9, 2017, the state legislature approved the creation of three Indigenous municipalities, which took effect on January 1, 2019.

The major communities of Morelos are Cuernavaca (population 366,321; altitude , Jiutepec (population 214,137; altitude , Cuautla (population 194,786, altitude , Temixco (population 116,143, altitude , Emiliano Zapata (population 99,493, altitude , Ayala (population 85,521, altitude , Xochitepec (population 68,984, altitude , Puente de Ixtla population 66,435, altitude , Jojutla (population 57,121, altitude , and Yecapixtla (population 52,651, altitude .

==Economy and tourism==
The economy of Morelos is based on agriculture, tourism, and urbanization. Since the 1960s, the economy has been shifting from agriculture to industry and commerce. However, most of these shifts have occurred on a small scale and a number of municipalities are still almost completely reliant on agriculture. While the state provides just 1.6% of the country&#x27;s GDP, its economy is strong enough to attract workers, especially farm workers from other areas of the country. However, a large percentage of the state&#x27;s population works six days a week, receiving wages of only 500 to 700 Mexican pesos ($46–$65USD), despite the fact that Morelos is one of the more expensive states to live in.

Economically, the state divides into seven districts. The Cuernavaca Region includes the municipalities of Cuernavaca, Temixco, Emiliano Zapata, Jiutepec, and Xochitepec. The North Region includes the municipalities of Huitzilac, Tepoztlán, Tlalnepantla, and Totolapan. The Cuautla Region includes the municipalities of Atlatlahucan, Ayala, Cuautla, Tlayacapan, Yautepec de Zaragoza, and Yecapixtla. The Northeast Region includes Ocuituco, Temoac, Tetela del Volcán, and Zacualpan de Amilpas. The Southeast Region includes Axochiapan, Jantetelco, Jonacatepec and Tepalcingo. The South Region includes Amacuzac, Jojutla, Puente de Ixtla, Tlaltizapán, Tlaquiltenango, and Zacatepec de Hidalgo; and the Western Region includes Coatlán del Río, Mazatepec, Miacatlán and Tetecala.

In 2003, Morelos was one of the first states to take advantage of a new law allowing states to sell bonds. In 2002, the state sold $24 million USD worth of bonds on the Mexican stock market in order to finance highways, schools, waterworks and other infrastructure projects. The bond sales also allowed the state to access lower-interest long-term financing.

Due to its location near Mexico City, the state has one of the lower rates of economic marginalization, ranking 20th of 33 units in economic marginalization, based on housing and education. The most urbanized areas of the state are the strongest economically, with the least urbanized being the poorest. Two of the factors in the development of the state&#x27;s economy since the 1960s are the opening of the Mexico City-Acapulco highway through the state in 1952 and the creation of the Civac (Ciudad Industrial Valle de Cuernavaca) industrial complex in 1965. This concentrated the population growth into the northern part of the state. Eleven of the state&#x27;s 36 municipalities are considered to have a serious degree of marginalization: Tlalnepantla, Totolapan, Tlayacapan, Tetela del Volcán, Ocuituco, Zaculapan, Temoac, Tepalcingo, Amacuzac, Coatlán del Río, Miacatlán and some parts of Puente de Ixtla.

Since the 1980s, the agricultural sector of the economy has been steadily shrinking but it remains an important part of the state&#x27;s economy, as there are still a significant number of communities that rely on it. Just under 20% of the working population of the state is involved in farming, ranching, fish farming or forestry. Land available for human exploitation outside of populated areas is divided between agriculture/grazing (45%) and forestry (55%). Agricultural and forestry lands are further subdivided by climate and the type of forest (conifer vs. rainforest). Roughly 70% of the state has a subtropical climate, providing ideal conditions for agriculture, in particular sugar cane, and most farming is done in the warmer areas. Sugar cane has been an important crop since colonial times and still is important today, although the percentage of land dedicated to it has decreased since the 1960s. Another important crop is rice. The production of rice in the state has fallen drastically, from a height of 100,000 tons annually to only 21,000 tons due to the reduction in cultivation areas and the high costs of production. The state still ranks sixth in its production. However, despite price and market protections, foreign rice is competing with rice produced in the state. Sorghum has replaced lost yields of sugar cane and rice to a certain extent, which has been encouraged by the government. One way the state tries to sell its more expensive products such as rice has been the registration of a trademark called&quot;Tradición Agrícola de Morelos&quot; (Morelos Agricultural Tradition) to identify products produced in the state on store shelves.

Another important cash and export crop is fresh flowers and ornamental plants. In 2003, this sector accounted for 27 million dollars of income to the state, up from 20 million in 2000. Morelos is Mexico&#x27;s major producers of roses, producing 54,552 dozens in 2002. Morelos claims to be the native location of the poinsettia, called &quot;noche buena&quot; in Spanish. It is native to Mexico, but there has been a &quot;diplomatic patent&quot; on the plant since the early 19th century when the first US ambassador to Mexico, Joel Roberts Poinsett, registered it. The state&#x27;s historical society has asked the secretary of the interior to review treaties and work to have this patent annulled. As it stands now, Mexican poinsettia growers must pay royalty fees to the U.S. and even import cuttings from authorized growers in the U.S. to grow the plant commercially. Another effort to combat the patent is to develop a new variety of the flower that would not be covered.

Along with corn and beans are grown for subsistence, other fruits and vegetables are widely grown. These include bananas, cherimoyas, mameys, melons, cucumbers, tomatillos, jicama, squash, alfalfa, cotton, peanuts, onions and tomatoes. Many crops are grown for self-consumption, especially in indigenous areas. The state is working to help shift agriculture production from traditional corn and beans, which can be imported cheaper, to other products such as apricots, which have been shown to make money. Livestock mostly consists of cattle, pigs, horses, and domestic fowl. There is some fish farming in the state, mostly of mojarra and tilapia in Rodeo and Zacatepec.

Industry, mining, and construction accounts for 29% of the state&#x27;s GDP and employs 27% of the working population. Food processing (especially sugar came, rice, sorghum and grains) represents an important industry.

Goods produced include automobiles and auto parts, textiles, pharmaceuticals, metal products, agro-industry, ceramics, and handcrafted items. Most exports go to the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Union. In the early 2000s, the state attracted a number of foreign enterprises to build industrial facilities here, includes car parts such as windshields.

There are two major industrial parks in the state, Ciudad Industrial del Valle de Cuernavaca (CIVAC) and Parque Industrial de Cuautla (PINC). CIVAC is located in the municipality of Jiutepec. It was created in 1966 and is considered to be the most important economic development in the state. Today the park is home to 108 businesses, 35% of which are transnational. The Parque Industrial de Cuautla is located outside of the city. It occupies 113 hectares, with about 40% of this available. The industrial park suffered major fire damage in 2007. In 2009, the government intervened with plans to revive the park and improve its infrastructure with a budget of 240 million pesos.

The &quot;Desarrollo Industrial Emiliano Zapata&quot; is the newest park, located just outside Cuernavaca in the municipality of Emiliano Zapata. It has an extension of 23.5 hectares. One of its principal occupants is the &quot;Nu Star&quot;t clothing manufacturer. Another is the &quot;Emiliano Zapata Central de Abastos&quot; (wholesale food market).

Commerce, transportation, services, and tourism accounts for 59% of the state&#x27;s GDP and employs just over 50% of the working population. The growth of the commerce sector is due to urbanization and the growth of tourism. The biggest selling point of the state touristically is its location, just south of Mexico City, which has the largest and wealthiest population in the country. Many of these people come to spend the weekend in Cuernavaca&#x27;s nightclubs and away from Mexico City&#x27;s traffic and pollution. Many of these visitors have bought second homes here, which has driven property prices up. Those from Mexico City and other cities are also attracted to the states water parks and spas, such as Las Palmas in Tehuixtla, El Rollo and the Parque Acuatico Oaxtepec.
The state, especially around the capital of Cuernavaca, has experienced a housing boom since the late 1990s. More than 10,000 houses were built from 2000 to 2008 and another 50,000 are planned through 2013. The state&#x27;s office of urban development states that this is far above what is needed to house the state&#x27;s population. Instead, it reflects demand from Mexico City for a weekend and getaway homes. The housing boom has put a strain on infrastructure and on property prices.

===Tourism===

The secretary of tourism for the state promotes the cities of Cuernavaca and Cuautla; the Magic Towns of Tepoztlán and Tlayacapan; the archaeological site of Xochicalco; and Lake Tequesquitengo.

As the center of the state&#x27;s history and culture, the city of Cuernavaca has landmarks and attractions such as the Palacio de Cortés, where Hernán Cortés centered his enterprises of the &quot;Marquesado del Valle de Oaxaca&quot;, and now the site of the mural called History of Morelos, Conquest and Revolution by Diego Rivera; the Morelos and Juárez Gardens, the Cuernavaca Cathedral, and the Borda Garden. The city has several other museums and colonial-era churches, as well as a large variety of hotels and restaurants, including the world-renowned &quot;Las Mañanitas&quot;. The various Spanish language schools in Cuernavaca also attract foreign students, many from the United States.

Tepoztlán is a &quot;New Age&quot; town famous for its crafts market and its &quot;revitalizing energy.&quot; The pyramid of El Tepozteco, dedicated to the god of pulque, is located at the summit of a hill and requires a two-hour climb for a majestic view of the valley below. Tepoztlan was named a &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; in 2002. It is home to one of the Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl, a World Heritage Site. Hiking and camping are popular in the area, and the town boasts two large campgrounds—Camohmila, owned by the YMCA, and Meztitla, owned by the Scouts of Mexico (ASMAC). Tepoztlán&#x27;s pre-Lenten Carnaval is the largest and best known in the state.

Tlayacapan is located in the northeast part of the state, just south of Mexico City. It is a rural area, with a way of life that has not changed much over the 20th century. Ninety percent of its population is still partially or fully dependent on agriculture. The town has old mansions, houses with red tile roofs and streets paved with stones. Many ravines crisscross the area and are crossed by numerous stone bridges. It is also home to the San Juan Bautista Monastery and 26 chapels built in the colonial era. Tlayacapan produces unique black pottery.
Cuautla is the third-largest city in the state and was the site of one of the early major battles of the Mexican War of Independence and later the Battle of Cuautla during the Mexican Revolution. The center of the town is home to the Municipal Palace and the Santo Domingo Church. One major attraction is the Morelos House, where José María Morelos y Pavón lived during the 1812 siege of the city. Near the city are various spas and water parks such as the &quot;Agua Hedionda&quot;, famous for its sulfur-laden waters.

Lake Tequesquitengo (&quot;Laguna de Tequesquitengo&quot;), which many claim was created when the area was flooded by damming the local river, is located 45 km south of Cuernavaca in the Municipio of Jojutla. The lake is 3 km by 4.5 km and is used by visitors for watersports, including water-skiing, scuba diving, and fishing; as well as for weekend getaways. Also near Jojutla, you can find the ex-hacienda of &quot;Vista Hermosa&quot;, now a hotel and restaurant. &quot;Jardines de Mexico&quot;, the largest floral park in the world, is also close, and there are several water parks in the region.

====History====

History buffs may want to start at the Cuauhnáhuac Regional Museum (a.k.a. Palace of Cortes, which has exhibited about the history of the state, from the time of the earliest inhabitants, the Colonial era, the Mexican Revolution and beyond.[150] The museum includes the Diego Rivera mural, History of Morelos, Conquest and Revolution.

The state has a number of archeological sites. The most important are Chalcatzingo, an Olmec settlement from 750 to 500 BCE located in Jantetelco; Zazacatla from the same era and located in Xochitepec; Coatetelco from 500 to 150 BCE, located in the municipality of that same name. Xochicalco is the largest and most important archaeological site in the state. Located in the municipalities of Miacatlan and Temixco, this was a fortified trading center that may have been built by refugees from Teotihuacan from AD 700-900 (designated as a World Heritage Site). Its best-known structures are the Temple of Quetzalcoatl and its observatory. Xochicalco is probably the location of &#x27;Tamoanchan&#x27; as described by Bishop Francisco Plancarte y Navarrete. Teopanzolco in Cuernavaca was a ceremonial center of the Tlahuicas. The most important temple is the Twin Temples (Templos Gemelos), which may have been a model for the Templo Mayor in Mexico City. This site was unknown until the 1914 Siege of Cuernavaca during the Mexican Revolution. Popular with tourists is El Tepozteco located on the Sierra de Tepoztlan.

While Morelos was key to the 1521 conquest of Tenochtitlan, there are no vestiges of the battles to be found in the state. The &quot;Ruta de los Conventos&quot; or &quot;Ruta de los Volcanos&quot; established by the state tourism agency, takes one from Cuernavaca to Tepoztlan, Oaxtepec, Tlayacapan, Totolapan, Yecapixtla, Ocuituc, Tetela del Volcán, and Zacualpan de Amilpas. These monasteries plus those in Atlatlahuacán and Hueyapán are included in the Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl World Heritage site. This area also has varying landscapes, a wide variety of flora and fauna as well as churches, former haciendas, archeological sites and ruins. Civilian monuments from the Colonial era include the aforementioned Palace of Cortes and Borda Garden in Cuernavaca, as well as the many sugar cane &#x27;haciendas&#x27; (estates or plantations) and aqueducts found throughout the state.
Cuautla was the site of an important battle during the Mexican War of Independence, led by Jose Maria de Morelos. There is a museum dedicated to Morelos there, and one can visit other sites related to the siege of the city. There is a small museum dedicated to his right-hand man, Father Mariano Matamoros, in Jantetelco.

The train stations of Cuautla and Cuernavaca both date from the 19th century. The former is now a museum while the latter is a dance academy. Also in Cuernavaca is the Porfirio Diaz bridge.

The &quot;Ruta de Zapata&quot; (Zapata Route) covers the areas General Emiliano Zapata operated throughout the state of Morelos during the Mexican Revolution. Begin in Cuautla and travel through history, since the streets are named after the moments that were lived during the struggles for independence and the Mexican Revolution. A few blocks from the zócalo is the statue and burial site of Zapata. The route continues to Ciudad Ayala, the cradle of the Revolution in Morelos. Follow the tour of Tlaltizapan, where Zapata established his headquarters. Then go to Yautepec, where you can see the hull of the Hacienda de Atlihuayan, which is private but was the place that minted the coins used by the Zapatistas.

====Outdoor recreation====

The year-round warm climate of Morelos makes outdoor sports easily accessible.

There are dozens of waterparks, including natural waterparks (some with hot springs); world-class adventure parks; and small, rustic waterparks. Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, in Oaxtepec, is located in the eastern part of the state. The area has been used as a swimming resort since the time of Aztec &quot;tlotoni&quot; (emperor) Moctezuma II. &quot;Las Estacas&quot; in Tlaltizapan is built around a crystal-clear river surrounded by lush vegetation. A small museum dedicated to Revolutionary War General Emiliano Zapata is nearby. &quot;El Rollo&quot; in &quot;Tlalquitenango&quot;, Jojutla is located fifty minutes south of Cuernavaca. It covers an area of 30 hectares and is one of the largest water parks in Latin America. &quot;Ex-Hacienda de Temixco&quot; is located 10 minutes south of Cuernavaca in the town of Temixco. This park is built on the site of a 16th-century sugar-cane plantation which was appropriated during the Mexican Revolution.

Water-skiing is popular at Lake Tequesquitengo and &quot;Acuaski&quot;. Scuba and snorkeling are popular at &quot;Las Estacas&quot; and at Lake Tequesquitengo. White-water rafting is available on the Amacuzac River.

Hiking is done primarily along the &quot;Corredor Biológico Ajusco Chichinautzin&quot; in the mountainous regions of Huitzilac, Tepoztlan, and Tlayacapan. Many waterparks allow camping, and both the YMCA and the Scouts of Mexico operate large campgrounds in Tepoztlan. Rock climbing and rappel are popular at the Scout camp in Meztitla and elsewhere, such as Lagunas de Zempoala National Park. There isn&#x27;t really much mountain climbing in Morelos, and it is illegal to climb Popocatepetl since the volcano is active.

Bicycling might be done by following the former rail line from Mexico City to Cuernavaca. There are dozens of bicycle routes in Cuernavaca and Tepoztlan. Cuernavaca bike routsTepoztlan bike routes

====Zoos and wildlife sanctuaries====
Zoológico Zoofari is a Safari Park in Amacuzac located at Km 55 of the Cuernavaca-Taxco highway. Opened in May 1984, Zoofari has 130 species and 1200 animals on exhibit, including zebras, ostriches, antelopes, lions, elephants, rhinos, and giraffes. The zoo is divided into six sections, five of which can be visited by car. There is a zip line, a restaurant, and a gift shop. Visitors can have their pictures taken with animal cubs and can ride dromedaries, llamas, and ponies.

There is a small petting zoo, a butterfly sanctuary, and a &quot;Herpetario&quot; (Reptile House) at the &quot;Parque Ecológico Chapultepec&quot; in Cuernavaca. There is a butterfly sanctuary at &quot;Jardines de México&quot; in Jojutla. There is a turtle sanctuary in Cuautla.

Visitors can ride horses or ponies at Lagunas de Zempoala National Park in Huitzilac. Kite flying and hiking are also popular there.

==Culture==
Culturally, the state divides into four sections. &quot;Zona Norte&quot; is linked to the Valley of Mexico and includes the municipalities of Cuernavaca, Tepoztlán, Tlalnepantla, Totolapan, Atlatlahucan, Yecapixtla, Ocuituco and Tetela del Volcán. &quot;Zona Oriente&quot; is linked to Puebla and includes the municipalities of Zacualpan de Amilpas, Jantetelco, Jonacatepec and Axochiapan. &quot;Zona Sur Oeste&quot; includes the municipalities of Tlaquiltenango, Jojutla, Zacatepec, Puente de Ixtla, Amacuzac, Coatlán del Río, Tetecala, Mazatepec and Miacatlán. &quot;Zona Centro&quot; includes the municipalities of Temixco, Yautepec, Jiutepec, Emiliano Zapata, Ayala, Tlaltizapan and Axochiapan.

===Cuisine===
In Cuernavaca, at &quot;Las Mañanitas&quot;, diners enjoy chicken in green &quot;mole&quot;, tortilla soup and trout almandine, among other selections, surrounded by tropical plants and birds. At &quot;Reposado&quot;, nouvelle Mexican offerings include &quot;huitlacoche&quot; (corn smut) fondue, salmon in &quot;adobo&quot; and game hen in peanut &quot;mole&quot;. In addition to the more famous restaurants, Cuernavaca has its share of mom-and-pop eateries, which feature a good variety of enchiladas with various fillings and sauces, and local specialties like rabbit in &quot;ancho chile adobo&quot; and chicken in peach sauce. The latter is a very characteristic dish of the region since it combines chicken with fruit, of which Morelos has seemingly endless varieties. The &quot;taco acorazado&quot;, consisting of two large tortillas, rice, and beef or chicken, is the most typical food of Cuernavaca. &quot;Tacos al pastor&quot;, which is marinated pork slowly cooked by a gas flame on a vertical rotisserie and served on small tortillas, is also popular in the area.

Travelers from Mexico City to Cuernavaca often stop in &quot;Tres Marias,&quot; located in the Municipio of Huitzilac. The town is located about halfway between the two cities, at an altitude of 2,814 meters. The town is known for its quesadillas, mushroom soup, &quot;gordas&quot; with whey, and longaniza with chile sauce.

Yecapixtla, located in the eastern part of the state north of Cuautla, is famous for its cecina, or salted beef, which is usually served with fresh cream. Jantetelco is known for crystalized fruit, while Alpuyeca in the west is famous for its ice cream.

Tepoztēcatl, the Aztec god who is said to have created &quot;pulque&quot;, a drink made from fermented maguey, was born in Amatlan, Tepoztlán; most pulque produced in Morelos comes from the municipality of Huitzilac today. Mezcal and several craft beers are produced in Morelos.

===Theater, movies, television===
Many famous Mexican and American actors have (or have had) homes in Morelos, but the state does not have much of a theater tradition. The &quot;Teatro Ocampo&quot; in Cuernavaca is one of the few places which has a live theater.

Students who wish to study acting can attend the state university UAEM, the &quot;Centro de Bellas Artes&quot;, or &quot;Escuela Laboratorio de Teatro La Rueca&quot; Hacienda Tetala, Cuernavaca.

Numerous scenes from television and movies have been filmed in Morelos, including: &quot;Second Chance&quot;, 1953; &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;, 1954; &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, 1960 (Tlyacapan); &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, 1969 (Tlayacapan); &quot;Two Mules for Sister Sarah&quot;, 1970 (Tlayacapan); &quot;Rio Lobo&quot;, 1970 (Cuernavaca); &quot;Under the Volcano (1984 film)&quot;, 1984 (Yautepec, Cuautla, and Cuernavaca); &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, 1994 (Cuernavaca); &quot;Vantage Point&quot;, 2008 (Cuernavaca); and &quot;A Dying King: The Shah of Iran&quot; (documentary), 2017 (Cuernavaca).

===Music, dance, and &quot;Carnaval&quot;===

Most of the state&#x27;s traditional music is associated with corridos. The &quot;corrido&quot; is sung and played in many parts of Mexico. Those performed in Morelos belong to the &quot;sureño&quot; (southern) type, which can be complicated but, unlike the northern version, is not meant for dancing. The lyrics of this type of corrido generally have eight syllables per line forming stanzas of five verses each. This type of corrido dates back before the Mexican Revolution, but the tradition has waned. One band noted for saving traditional melodies and songs is the &quot;Banda Tlayacapan&quot;, based in Tlayacapan in the north of the state. This band was formed in 1870 and is the state&#x27;s oldest band organization. In popular music, the best-known composer from the state is Arturo Márquez, who was born in Samosa, Sonora, but has lived in Cuernavaca for a long time. He is known for his danzones.

One tradition that is identified with the state of Morelos is the Dance of the Chinelos. The dance is popular on many occasions but especially during Carnaval (English: Carnival). The origin of the dance or tradition is not known. One story dates the origin to 1870 when a group of youths decided to dress in old clothes, covering their faces in cloth to shout and jump around in the streets. Other stories place the origin in the colonial past, either as a syncretism between Spanish and indigenous dances, or as a protest or mockery of the indigenous&#x27; Spanish overlords. However, it has clearly been identified as originating in Tlayacapan and later spreading to various parts of Morelos, Puebla, and Mexico City.

Today, the Chinelo is a symbol of the identity of the state. Although Chinelos are most frequently found in Tepoztlán, Chinelos groups exist in many communities such as Yautepec, Oacalco, Cualtlixco, Atlahuahuacàn, Oaxtepec, Jojutla, and Totolapan. They can also be found in certain parts of Puebla. The Chinelos dance in groups near each other. Each dancer has his or her own style that has been developed since childhood.

Although not as well known as the &quot;Carnaval&quot; of Veracruz, a number of communities in the state hold Carnival celebrations in the days leading up to Ash Wednesday. These include Jiutepec, Tlaltizapán, Emiliano Zapata, Tepoztlán, Tlayacapan, Yautepec, and Xochitepec. What distinguishes carnivals in Morelos from others in Mexico is the participation of the Chinelos and bands with wind instruments. In Tepotzlan on a Sunday before Ash Wednesday, the traditional tianguis market is cleared away from the main square and hundreds of multicolored stands move onto the streets in order to make way for Carnival. The street stands mostly specialize in items needed to enjoy the event. Chinelo dancers dominate the event, many in costumes which have been very expensive to assemble. Other events during Carnival there are processions, including the principal one in which there are representatives of all the communities of the municipality. The events last from Sunday to midnight Tuesday, signaling the beginning of Ash Wednesday and Lent. Each day, the Chinelos dance more energetically than the last.

===Art and literature===

Most of the state&#x27;s art scene dates from the 20th century. After the Mexican Revolution, and partly because of state&#x27;s role in it, a number of muralists came to the state and painted works with social themes in places such as the Palacio de Cortés and the Museo de la Tallera Siqueiros. Cuernavaca has several art museums:
* The Robert Brady Museum of folk art, which is located in the &quot;Centro Historico&quot; (Historical Center) of the city, around the corner from the cathedral. Brady was an heir of the Mayflower moving company in the U.S. and an art collector. 
* The &quot;Museo Morelense de Arte Contemporáneo Juan Soriano&quot; (MMAC) is a project by JSa Arquitectura led by the architect Javier Sánchez Corral. Its location links Amatitlán, an emblematic town of Cuernavaca whose origins date back 1500 years, to the Historic Center of Cuernavaca, enriching the urban experience. It is the largest exhibition space in the state of Morelos, distributed in two galleries for temporary exhibitions: Central Gallery and Cube, in addition to an Open Forum, a multidisciplinary space. The museum includes a library, a sculptural garden, and workshops for public programs.

Public art includes the mural on the library of &quot;Parque Alameda Solidaridad Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta&quot;, in Cuernavaca. The mural depicts the history of the state. In addition, there is a large fountain that resembles a pre-Hispanic ball field. Also, at the entrance to the &quot;Fraccionamiento Lomas de Cuernavaca&quot; in the municipality of Temixco, just outside Cuernavaca, is the &quot;Glorieta de La Luna&quot; with Venetian mosaic by José García Narezo. Along the main street, &quot;Paseo de la Reforma&quot;, there are numerous shapes covered with ceramic tiles in the Gaudí style, with diverse representations, including the stars, dragons, and signs of the Zodiac. These are popularly called &quot;Las Bolas&quot;, (the balls), and are a favorite play area for children. In the 1960s, Rosell built the &quot;Fuente de las mariposas&quot;, (Butterfly Fountain) at the entrance to Tequesquitengo.

Because of the state&#x27;s mild climate and Cuernavaca&#x27;s cultural tradition, many Mexican and foreign artists and writers have made the state home. Joy Laville is from Wight, England and resides in Cuernavaca. She is known for her landscapes which often include nude humans. Some of her works are &quot;Mujer viendo una casa&quot;, &quot;Mujer en perfil&quot; and &quot;Mujer con flores&quot;. Jorge Cázares Campos is a native of the state who is a self-taught painter, mostly of Mexican landscapes. Rafael Cauduro was born in Mexico City and his artwork has brought him fame not only in Morelos but internationally as well. Magali Lara is also originally from Mexico City and has had shows in various countries. Morelos native Carlos Campos Campus is known for his sculpture with pre-Hispanic influence. John Spencer was an American artist and writer whose legacy includes the &quot;Casona Spencer&quot; across from the cathedral and the murals of the &quot;Church of the Three Kings&quot; in the Santa Maria neighborhood in the north part of the city.

As for the literary heritage of Morelos, the most important writer was Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, author of &quot;El Zarco&quot;, the story of the leader of a group of bandits based in Yautepec during the Reform War, 1857–1860. Another well-known writer is Malcolm Lowry, an Englishman who wrote &quot;Bajo del Volcán&quot; in the first half of the 20th century. It is set in Cuernavaca and made the city internationally famous. Elena Garro is an important Mexican writer originally from Puebla, but who lived most of her life in Cuernavaca. She is known for works such as &quot;Los Recuerdos del Porvenir&quot;, &quot;El Árbol&quot; and &quot;Andarse por las ramas&quot;. Another Mexican transplant to Cuernavaca is Franciso Hinojosa, one of the best-known authors of children&#x27;s literature in the country.

Poets Raúl Isidro Burgos (b. in Cuernavaca 1890, d. in Mexico City 1971), Raúl Isidro Burgos (b. in Jojutla 1975), Miguel Ángel Muñoz Palos (b. in Cuernavaca 1972), and Luis Ruiz de Velasco (b. in Jojutla 1909, d. in Mexico City 2003).

Other writers are Agustín Aragón y León (b. in Jonacatepec 1870, d. in Mexico City 1954), Erwin Möller (b. in Cuernavaca 1954), and Gerardo Horacio Porcayo (b. in Cuernavaca 1964),

===Architecture===

====Pre-Hispanic====

The most important pre-Hispanic ruins are found at the Xochicalco. This is a fortified city that was built on top of a large hill, including a Temple of Quetzalcoatl as its center. There is an observatory, three ball courts, and a &quot;tezmacal&quot; (steam bath) as well as a large museum. Xochicalco displays significant influence from Teotihuacan, the Maya civilization, and Monte Albán.

Teopanzolco is located in Cuernavaca. The twin temple and several smaller structures were built by &quot;Tlahuicas&quot;. Recent excavations suggest it dates from 1200 CE and it may have served as a model for the &quot;Templo Mayor&quot; in Mexico City.

Other important archaeological sites in Morelos are: &quot;Olintepec&quot;, Ayala. 14 structures that date from 1500–1200 BCE; &quot;Las Pilas&quot;, Jonacatepec. 4 pyramids and 2 plazas from 700–500 BCE located inside a water park; Tepozteco, Tepoztlan. A small pyramid built at the top of a hill in about 1200 BCE and last modified in 1452; Yautepec. From the &quot;periodo postclásico medio y tardío&quot;, this was a center for 11,500 people; Chalcatzingo, Jantetelco. Constructions and petroglyphs from 1500–200 BCE. There are clear influences of the Olmecs from Veracruz and Tabasco, and Coatetelco, Miacatlán. Pyramids, platforms, and a ball court that date from 200–1521 CE.

====Colonial era and early independence====

After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, major constructions here were Christian instead of the native pagan. In the first half of the 16th century, a series of fortress-like church and monastery complexes were built around the slopes of the Popocatepetl volcano from Cuernavaca to Tetela del Volcán, and on into Puebla state, all related to early evangelization efforts. Today, these monasteries are no longer used as such, although most of the churches associated with them remain active, and are now a World Heritage Site.

Non-ecclesiastical buildings from the colonial and independence periods were mostly confined to the capital of Cuernavaca and include the Palace of Cortes, the &quot;Jardin Borda&quot; (Borda Garden), the Cine Morelos and the Ocampo Theater. The kiosk of the Jardin Juarez in Cuernavaca was designed by Gustave Eiffel in 1886.

Much of the rest of the state was divided into large &quot;haciendas&quot;, many dedicated to sugar production, with large mansions for their owners. Some of the most interesting are
* Museo del Agrarismo Ex-Hacienda de Chinameca, Ciudad Ayala, Ayala, (museum: site where Emiliano Zapata was assassinated April 19, 1919)
* Hacienda de Chiconcuac, Xochitopec (rental for special events)
* Hacienda San Carlos, Yautepec (rental for special events; Zapatista Gen. Beningo Zeteno was hanged there during the Revolution)
* Hacienda de San Gaspar, Jiutepec (rental for special events; golf course, Catholic chapel open to public for Sunday mass) 
* Hacienda de San Jacinto Ixtoluca, Tlaquiltenango (water park; Zapatista Gen. Otilio Montaňo was killed there under mysterious circumstances.)
* Hacienda de San Jose Acamilpa, Tlaquiltenango (luxury hotel &amp; restaurant)
* Hacienda San Gabriel de las Palmas, Amacuzac (luxury hotel &amp; restaurant)
* Hacienda San Antonio Caohuixtla, Ayala (rustic, camping, horseback riding, banquets)
* Hacienda de Santa Ana Tenango, Jantetelco (social events)
* Hacienda de Temixco (water park; concentration camp for Japanese-Mexicans during WWII)
* Hacienda Santa Cruz Vista Alegre Casco Antiguo y Trapiche, Mazatepec (small hotel, camping)
* Hacienda Antonio Atlacomulco (Ex-Hacienda de Cortés), Atlacomulco, Jiutepec (luxury hotel &amp; restaurant)
* Hacienda Cocoyoc, Yautepec (large hotel, restaurant, golf course)
* Hotel Hacienda San Jóse Vista Hermosa, Puente de Ixtla; (family hotel &amp; restaurant)

====20th and 21st centuries====

One notable 20th-century structure was the Japanese-style house built by Woolworths heiress Barbara Hutton, in Jiutepec, just outside the city of Cuernavaca. This is a hotel and restaurant today.

A modern Catholic church is the &quot;Capilla Abierta de San José&quot; in Lomas de Cuernavaca, Temixco. The church was designed by Spanish architect Félix Candela in the 1950s in the style known as &quot;Techos de Cascaron&quot;. Set upon a hill, the open-air chapel offers an impressive view of the Valley of Cuernavaca.

The &quot;Centro Cultural Pedro López Elías&quot; (Pedro Lopez Elias Cultural Center) in Tepoztlan opened in 2016. It is the first ecological library in Mexico, contains 50,000 books, and has 42,000 solar panels. The &quot;Centro Cultural Teopanzolco&quot; (Teopanzolco Cultural Center) next to the pyramids in Cuernavaca was designed by the Mexican architects Isaac Broid. The triangles that dictate the composition mark this point of meeting between past and present. It opened in 2018.

==Education==

The state, especially in the Cuernavaca area, is known as a center of education, second to Mexico City. The state has a high percentage of educated and well-traveled people, many of whom speak second languages such as English, French and German.

Modern education in the state began during the Reform period, with the Mexican government taking over educational responsibilities from the church. The government&#x27;s role in education expanded after the Mexican Revolution. In Morelos, the government founded &quot;Casas del Pueblo&quot; (People&#x27;s Houses) staffed with a teacher for the community to become a central figure. In 1936, the &quot;Escuela Regional Campesina&quot; (Farm Workers&#x27; Regional School) was established in Yautepec and a short time after that President Lázaro Cárdenas founded the &quot;Escuela Normal Feminina de Palmira&quot; (Palmira Teachers College for Women) and the &quot;Instituto Federal de Capacitacion del Magisterio&quot; for those to earn or complete their teaching credentials.

Until 1991, education was rigidly centralized and bureaucratic, causing difficulties in providing adequate education to many areas. In 1992, the &quot;Instituto de la Educación Básica&quot; (IEBM) (Basic Education Institute) was created to change this. This divided basic education into preschool, special education, primary and secondary.

Today over 360,000 students are taught by over 13,000 teachers in 823 schools up to the ninth grade. All municipalities are required by state law to provide preschool, and grade school education to their populations up to the ninth grade, as well as professional development for teachers. All are required to attend school up to the ninth grade. Most schoolchildren begin with at least one year of preschool or kindergarten and secondary school (middle school) is provided either through face-to-face classes or through &quot;telesecundarias&quot; with televised classes in the more rural areas. Secondary schools are also divided into general and technical schools. The state has four teachers&#x27; colleges, two which produce primary school teachers and two which produce secondary school teachers. The state education system provides education from preschool to high school, vocational-technical education, as well as higher education to the doctoral level. There are also &quot;centros de capacitacion&quot; or training centers for workers looking to improve basic skills or gain technical skills. The average number of years of schooling completed is 8.4 years (second year of middle school), with the national average at 8.1.

There are a total of 32 institutions of higher education in the state. The state has been encouraging schools and universities to set up campuses in Morelos to escape the hustle and bustle of Mexico City. This includes: Universidad de la Salle, Universidad Latinoamericano (ULO), Tecnologico de Monterrey (ITESM), and Universidad Latina (UNILA).

The origins of the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos (UAEM) date back to the 19th century, when governor Francisco Leyva founded the &quot;Instituto Literario y Cientifico de Morelos&quot; in 1871. It was mostly suspended shortly thereafter by President Porfirio Díaz, a political opponent of Leyva, leaving only the School of Agriculture and Veterinary Studies in Acapantzingo. It was revived under the name of &quot;Instituto de Estudios Superiores del Estado de Morelos&quot; by Governor Elpidio Perdomo and President Lázaro Cárdenas. It was reorganized under its current name in 1953, after the addition of more fields of study. Currently, the school offers forty bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

==Transportation and communications==
Telecommunications in the state include telegraph, mail service, telephone, rural telephone service, terrestrial and satellite television, telex, and internet.

Rural telephone service is available via satellite in the municipalities of Amacuzac, Ayala, Puente de Ixtla, Jojutla, Tlaltizapan and Tlaquiltenango. There are 342,240 landline telephones in total.

There are 26 radio stations in Morelos (four AM and 22 FM). Morelos operates a public television station, XHCMO-TV Channel 3 in Cuernavaca, with a repeater, XHMZE-TV channel 22, in Zacatepec. Cuernavaca also has five other terrestrial television stations available, some local and others repeaters of Mexico City-based stations.

Newspapers of Morelos include: &quot;Diario de Morelos&quot;, &quot;El Regional del Sur&quot;, &quot;El Sol de Cuautla&quot;, &quot;El Sol de Cuernavaca&quot;, &quot;La Jornada de Morelos&quot;, &quot;La Unión de Morelos&quot;, and &quot;Unomásuno Morelos.&quot;

Morelos is the most-connected state in terms of roadways, with highways connecting all of its communities. It has of federal highways (including of tollways), of state highways (two or more lanes, paved), of rural highways (paved), and of improved paths, for a total of of highways. There are of rail lines.

The Cuernavaca Airport is General Mariano Matamoros International Airport, south of Cuernavaca in Acatlipa, Temixco. It has a runway. It opened in 1988, and since 2009 it has been operated by the firm &quot;Aeropuerto de Cuernavaca S. A. de C. V&quot;.

<text>Baduizm is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Erykah Badu. It was released on February 11, 1997, by Kedar Records and Universal Records. After leaving university in order to concentrate on music full-time, Badu then began touring with her cousin, Robert &quot;Free&quot; Bradford, and recorded a 19-song demo, &quot;Country Cousins&quot;, which attracted the attention of Kedar Massenburg. He set Badu up to record a duet with D&#x27;Angelo, &quot;Your Precious Love,&quot; and eventually signed her to a record deal with Universal. Recording sessions for the album took place from January to October 1996 in New York City, Philadelphia, and Dallas.

&quot;Baduizm&quot; was met with positive reviews from music critics who praised the album&#x27;s musical style and Badu&#x27;s artistic vision; other critics noted similarities between Badu and Billie Holiday. &quot;Baduizm&quot; was a commercial success, debuting at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album was certified three times platinum by Recording Industry Association of America, Gold by British Phonographic Industry and Gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association.

&quot;Baduizm&quot; was promoted with the release of four singles: &quot;On &amp; On&quot;, &quot;Next Lifetime&quot;, &quot;Otherside of the Game&quot;, and &quot;Appletree&quot;. The album received many accolades, including the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album at the 40th Grammy Awards. Along with fellow contemporary albums such as D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (1995) and Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Urban Hang Suite&quot; (1996), &quot;Baduizm&quot; success helped establish Badu as one of the leading artists in the neo-soul genre and is one of the albums credited with contributing to the genre&#x27;s commercial visibility at the time.

==Background and recording==

To focus on music full time Badu dropped out from Grambling State University. Badu then began working and touring with her cousin, Robert &quot;Free&quot; Bradford, during this period she recorded a 19-song demo, &quot;Country Cousins&quot;, which attracted the attention of Kedar Massenburg. Massenburg set a recording session up with D&#x27;Angelo to record, &quot;Your Precious Love,&quot; and eventually signed her to a record deal with Universal Records.
Badu was partly influenced by Brandy&#x27;s debut album, notably &quot;I Wanna Be Down&quot; and &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;. Badu also took inspiration from her ancestry particularly turbans and African drums.

Recording sessions started in January through to October 1996 at Battery Studios in New York City, Sigma Sounds &amp; Ivory Studios in Philadelphia, and Dallas Sound Lab in Dallas. Badu provided lead and background vocals, along with keyboards, drum machine and other music programming on the album with the help of Madukwu, N&#x27;Dambi, Bob Power, Ike Lee III, and Ron Carter. Shortly before the albums release, Badu grew unhappy with the recorded material and travelled back to Philadelphia to work with the Roots. The sessions led to the demo&#x27;s &quot;Otherside of the Game&quot; and &quot;Sometimes&quot; being included on &quot;Baduizm&quot;.

==Release and sales==
After &quot;Baduizm&quot; was released, it peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album&#x27;s success helped establish Badu as one of the leading artists in the flourishing neo-soul genre. &quot;Baduizm&quot; was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, Gold by the British Phonographic Industry and the Canadian Recording Industry Association. As of February 2017 the album has sold 2.8 million copies in United States.

The album produced four singles; the lead single &quot;On &amp; On&quot; was released in December 1996, and reached number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts and the UK Singles Charts, as well as making an appearance on the New Zealand charts.

A world tour to promote the album featured performances in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Brazil. Band members on tour were Charles &quot;Poogie&quot; Bell, Jr (drums), Bob Power (guitar), Hubert Eaves IV (bass) and Ike Lee III (keyboard). Background vocals were provided by N&#x27;dambi, Karen Bernod, Joyce M. Strong and Yahzarah. Opening acts included Chico DeBarge (USA—Leg), The Roots (USA—select dates) and Eric Benet (USA—select dates). Following the tour a &quot;Live&quot; concert album was recorded and released under Kedar/Universal.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Baduizm&quot; established Badu as a popular artist and received positive reviews from critics, who viewed the record as a return to the simplicity of early &#x27;70s soul. &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine&#x27;s Karen R. Good called the record &quot;a conduit of awakening of something dark, familiar and long slept,&quot; while John Bush from AllMusic felt it was innovative primarily for its sound, &quot;heavier hip-hop beats over organic, conscientious soul music.&quot;

Badu&#x27;s particular style of singing drew many comparisons to Billie Holiday. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said Badu echoed Holiday in &quot;her phrasing and cadence,&quot; while Greg Kot from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; commented: &quot;Rather than merely mimicking Holiday, Badu offers a canny update of the socially conscious soul of the early &#x27;70s with her mid-tempo grooves and sultry, conversational vocals.&quot; In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hilburn wrote: &quot;Freely mixing musical eras and inspirations (Billie Holiday to Stevie Wonder, jazz to hip-hop), Badu combines supper-club sophistication with an artistic vision as unique and independent&quot; as Prince in the &#x27;80s. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Miles Marshall Lewis stated: &quot;&quot;Baduizm&quot; showcases the heart and soul of a bohemian B-girl who happens to have an effortless jazz swing.&quot;

At the end of 1997, &quot;Baduizm&quot; was voted the seventh best record of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s supervisor, was less enthusiastic and dismissed the comparisons to Billie Holiday, deeming Badu &quot;a mite too -&quot; for his tastes.

==Accolades==

In 1997, Badu received six nominations and won three: Favorite Female Solo Single for &quot;On &amp; On&quot;, Favorite Female Solo Album for &quot;Baduizm&quot; and Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Song of the Year for &quot;On &amp; On&quot; at the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards.
In 1998, Badu received fourteen nominations and won eight, including Favorite R&amp;B/Soul or Rap New Artist at the American Music Awards; Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;On &amp; On&quot; and Best R&amp;B Album for &quot;Baduizm&quot; at the Grammy Awards; Outstanding New Artist and Outstanding Female Artist at the NAACP Image Awards; Favorite Female Soul/R&amp;B Single for &quot;On &amp; On&quot;, Favorite Female Soul/R&amp;B Album for &quot;Baduizm&quot; and Favorite New R&amp;B/Soul or Rap New Artist for &quot;On &amp; On&quot; at the Soul Train Music Awards.

&quot;Baduizm&quot; is listed as one of the 261 greatest albums since punk and disco (the year 1976), in the music critic Garry Mulholland&#x27;s book &quot;Fear of Music&quot; (). &#x27;This record works as seduction soundtrack, Saturday night chill-out, Sunday morning church replacement. The success of Erykah Badu&#x27;s masterpiece briefly threatened to inspire a new era in conscious soul. But only Lauryn Hill and D&#x27;Angelo were at her level. &quot;Baduizm&quot; stands alone, a missing link between &#x27;70s street funk, basement jazz, bohemian hip hop and the blues reinventions of Portishead.&quot;

In the 2020 reboot of their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Baduizm&quot; number 89.

<doc id="195831" wikidata="Q10471" url="?curid=195831" title="Aschaffenburg (district)">
<text>Aschaffenburg (Low Franconian: ) is a (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Darmstadt-Dieburg, Offenbach, Main-Kinzig (all in the state of Hesse), the districts Main-Spessart and Miltenberg, and the City of Aschaffenburg.

== History ==
The history of Aschaffenburg goes back as far as the year 957. Initially a Roman settlement, it came under the authority of the electors of Mainz in 982 and was chartered in 1173. Remains of Roman settlements were found on the river Main. There was a Roman military camp in today&#x27;s municipality of Stockstadt am Main. After the Roman retreat, the region became subject to Alemanni and Franks before becoming a part of the Electorate of Mainz. While the banks of the Main were populated all these centuries, the hills of the Spessart were virtually unsettled until the 13th century.

The districts of Aschaffenburg and Alzenau were established in 1862, half a century after the state of Bavaria had annexed the region. Thesdistricts were merged in 1972 to form the present district.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the extreme northwest of Bavaria and bounded by Hesse on two sides. The Main river forms the western border, though southwest of the town of Aschaffenburg, parts on the western river banks are incorporated into the district. The south and east of the district extends into the &quot;Mittelgebirge&quot; Spessart.

The town of Aschaffenburg is not included in the district ( &quot;kreisfrei&quot; ), but is nonetheless its administrative seat.

The geographic centre of the European Union was located in the District of Aschaffenburg from 2013 to 2020.

==Economy==
In 2017 (latest data available), the GDP per inhabitant was €33,109. This places the district 60th out of 96 districts (rural and urban) in Bavaria (overall average: €46,698).

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays:
* an acorn symbolising the Spessart hills and their dense forests
* the wheel of the electorate of Mainz
* the blue rings of the Echter family, which was a noble family possessing substantial holdings of land in the region

== Towns and municipalities ==

<doc id="195834" wikidata="Q558969" url="?curid=195834" title="Aladdin Sane">
<text>Aladdin Sane is the sixth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released in the United Kingdom on 19April 1973 through RCA Records. The follow-up to his breakthrough &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;, it was the first album he wrote and released from a position of stardom. It was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features contributions from Bowie&#x27;s backing band the Spiders from Mars — Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey — with the pianist Mike Garson, two saxophonists and three backing vocalists. Recorded in London and New York City between legs of the Ziggy Stardust Tour, the record was Bowie&#x27;s final album with the full Spiders lineup.

Most of the tracks were written on the road in the US and are greatly influenced by America and Bowie&#x27;s perceptions of the country. Due to the American influence and the fast-paced songwriting, the record features a tougher, heavier glam rock sound than its predecessor. The lyrics reflect the pros of Bowie&#x27;s newfound stardom and the cons of touring and contain images of urban decay, drugs, sex, violence and death. Some of the songs are influenced by the Rolling Stones; a cover of their song &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; is included. Bowie described the album&#x27;s title character, a pun on &quot;A Lad Insane&quot;, as &quot;Ziggy Stardust goes to America&quot;. The cover artwork, shot by Brian Duffy and featuring a lightning bolt across Bowie&#x27;s face, is regarded as one of his most iconic images.

Accompanied by the UK top-five singles &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; and &quot;Drive-In Saturday&quot;, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; was Bowie&#x27;s most commercially successful record up to that point, topping the UK Albums Chart and garnering him immense popularity there. It also received positive reviews from music critics, although many found it inferior to its predecessor. The popularity continued throughout the latter half of the Ziggy Stardust Tour, which featured various setlist and stage production changes. In later decades, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; has appeared on several best-of lists and is viewed as one of Bowie&#x27;s essential releases. It has been reissued several times and was remastered in 2013 for its 40th anniversary, which was included on the 2015 box set &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot;.

==Background and writing==

David Bowie launched to stardom in early July 1972 through the release of his fifth studio album &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; and his performance of &quot;Starman&quot; on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. He promoted the record through the Ziggy Stardust Tour in the United Kingdom and the United States, writing new songs on the road that would appear on his next album.

&quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; was the first album Bowie wrote and released from a position of stardom. Writing new material on the US leg of the tour in late 1972, many of the tracks were influenced by America and his perceptions of the country. The biographer Christopher Sandford believes the album showed that Bowie &quot;was simultaneously appalled and fixated by America&quot;. The tour, combined with other side projects during the period, such as co-producing Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Transformer&quot; and mixing the Stooges&#x27; &quot;Raw Power&quot;, took a toll on Bowie&#x27;s mental health, further influencing his writing. Due to being on the road, Bowie was unsure of the new album&#x27;s direction, believing he had said what he wanted to say about Ziggy Stardust, but knew he would &quot;end up doing...&#x27;Ziggy Part 2&#x27;&quot;. He stated: &quot;There was a point in &#x27;73 where I knew it was all over. I didn&#x27;t want to be trapped in this Ziggy character all my life. And I guess what I was doing on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, I was trying to move into the next area – but using a rather pale imitation of Ziggy as a secondary device. In my mind, it was Ziggy Goes to Washington: Ziggy under the influence of America.&quot;

Rather than continue the Ziggy Stardust character directly, Bowie decided to create a new persona, Aladdin Sane, who reflected the theme of &quot;Ziggy goes to America&quot; and, according to Bowie, was less defined and &quot;clear cut&quot; than Ziggy, and &quot;pretty ephemeral&quot;. According to the biographer David Buckley, the character was a &quot;schizoid amalgamation&quot; that was reflected in the music.

==Recording==

&quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; was mainly recorded between December 1972 and January 1973 between tour legs. Like his two previous records, it was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and featured Bowie&#x27;s backing band the Spiders from Mars – the guitarist Mick Ronson, the bassist Trevor Bolder and the drummer Mick Woodmansey. The lineup also featured the pianist Mike Garson, who was hired by Bowie at the suggestion of the RCA executive Ken Glancey and the singer-songwriter Annette Peacock; he remained with Bowie&#x27;s entourage for the next three years. The pianist came from a jazz and blues background, which the biographer Nicholas Pegg believes veered the album from pure rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and expanded Bowie&#x27;s experimental horizons. Buckley called &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; the beginning of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;experimental phase&quot; and cited Garson&#x27;s presence as &quot;revolutionary&quot;. Scott noted that Garson added elements to the arrangements that were not there before, including more keyboards and synthesisers. Garson later said that Scott as producer &quot;got the best piano sound out of any of his performances for Bowie.&quot; The pianist was given a lot of attention from Bowie in the studio, who mainly wanted to see what Garson could do. Other musicians hired for the album and tour included the saxophonists Ken Fordham and Brian Wilshaw; the singers Juanita Franklin and Linda Lewis as backing vocalists; and longtime friend Geoffrey MacCormack (later known as Warren Peace), who subsequently appeared on later Bowie records in the 1970s.

The first song recorded for the album was &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; on 6October 1972 at RCA Studios in New York City, after which the band and crew continued the tour in Chicago. Bowie produced the session himself. The band reconvened in New York with Scott in December, recording &quot;Drive-In Saturday&quot; and &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;, a track Bowie wrote and gave to the English band Mott the Hoople. Recording sessions continued in January 1973 at Trident Studios in London following the conclusion of the American tour and a series of UK Christmas concerts. Tracks recorded at Trident included album tracks &quot;Panic in Detroit&quot;, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, &quot;Cracked Actor&quot;, &quot;Lady Grinning Soul&quot;, &quot;Watch That Man&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;; outtakes included the &quot;sax version&quot; of the 1972 non-album single &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot; and &quot;1984&quot;, left off &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; and placed on &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974). A provisional running order included the remade &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot; and an unknown track titled &quot;Zion&quot;. The sessions concluded on 24January.

== Music and lyrics ==

Like &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; is predominantly glam rock, with elements of hard rock. The album&#x27;s American influence and fast-paced development added a tougher, rawer and edgier rock sound. Some of the songs, including &quot;Watch That Man&quot;, &quot;Drive-In Saturday&quot; and &quot;Lady Grinning Soul&quot; are influenced by the Rolling Stones; a cover of their song &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; is included.

According to Pegg, the album&#x27;s lyrics paint pictures of urban decay, degenerate lives, drug addiction, violence and death. He says that some themes present on Bowie&#x27;s previous works also appear in &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, including &quot;notions of religion shattered by science, extraterrestrial encounters posing as messianic visitations, the impact on society of different kinds of &#x27;star&#x27; and the degradation of human life in a spiritual void.&quot; The author James E. Perone states that thematically, the album deals with &quot;the concept and definition of sanity&quot;, while Ric Albano of &quot;Classic Rock Review&quot; wrote that the music reflects the pros of newfound stardom and the cons of the perils of touring.

===Side one===

The opening track, &quot;Watch That Man&quot;, was written in response to seeing two concerts by the American rock band New York Dolls. According to the author Peter Doggett, the Dolls&#x27; first two albums were important in representing the American response to the British glam rock movement. Bowie was impressed with their sound and wanted to emulate it on a song. Pegg describes &quot;Watch That Man&quot; as &quot;a sleazy garage rocker&quot; heavily influenced by the Rolling Stones, specifically their song &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (1971). The mix, in which Bowie&#x27;s lead vocal is buried beneath the instrumental sections, has been heavily criticised by critics and fans. Biographers compare it to the contemporaneous sound of Elton John and the Stones&#x27; &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972).

&quot;Aladdin Sane (1913–1938–197?)&quot; was inspired by Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;Vile Bodies&quot;, which Bowie read during his trip on the RHMS &quot;Ellinis&quot; back to the UK. Described by Buckley as the album&#x27;s &quot;pivotal&quot; song, it saw Bowie exploring more experimental genres, rather than strict rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. It features a piano solo by Garson, who had originally attempted a blues solo and Latin solo, which were politely rejected by Bowie, who asked him to play something more akin to the avant-garde jazz genre that Garson had come from. Improvised and recorded in one take, Buckley considers the solo a &quot;landmark&quot; recording. Doggett similarly believes that the track&#x27;s landscape belongs to Garson.

&quot;Drive-In Saturday&quot; was written following an overnight train ride between Seattle and Phoenix in early November 1972. He witnessed a row of silver domes in the distance and assumed they were secret government facilities used for a post-nuclear fallout. In the track, the radiation has affected people&#x27;s minds and bodies to the point that they need to watch films in order to learn to have sex again. It is heavily influenced by 1950s doo-wop music, and presents a contemporary update to the 1950s drive-in culture. As Bowie was influenced by Jungian ideas around creativity and madness, the artist Tanja Stark suggests the song&#x27;s lyrical reference to Jung &quot;crashing out with sylvian&quot; allude to Jung&#x27;s Red Book hallucinations possibly originating from the Sylvian fissure in the brain.

&quot;Panic in Detroit&quot; was inspired by Iggy Pop&#x27;s stories of the Detroit riots in 1967 and the rise of the White Panther Party, specifically their leader John Sinclair. Bowie compared the ideas of Sinclair to the rebel martyr Che Guevara for the narrator in &quot;Panic in Detroit&quot;. The lyrics are dark, featuring images of urban decay, violence, drugs, emotional isolation and suicide, adding to the album&#x27;s overarching theme of alienation. Musically, the song itself is built around a Bo Diddley beat; Pegg considers Ronson&#x27;s guitar part very &quot;bluesy&quot;.

&quot;Cracked Actor&quot; was written following Bowie&#x27;s stay at Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, where he witnessed prostitutes, drug use and sex. The song&#x27;s narrator is an aging film star whose life is beginning to decline; he is &quot;stiff on his legend&quot; and encounters a prostitute, whom he despises. There are numerous double entendres regarding film stardom and sex: &quot;show me you&#x27;re real/reel&quot;, &quot;smack, baby, smack&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;ve made a bad connection&quot;. Doggett describes the song as predominantly hard rock, with only a hint of glam, while Pegg describes Ronson&#x27;s guitar as &quot;dirty blues&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;Time&quot; was originally written as &quot;We Should Be On By Now&quot; for Bowie&#x27;s friend George Underwood, with vastly different lyrics. The song was then rewritten, influenced by the death of New York Dolls drummer Billy Murcia and the concepts of relativity and mortality. The song&#x27;s use of the word &quot;wanking&quot; led to it being banned by the BBC from radio stations. Garson&#x27;s stride and Brechtian cabaret-style piano dominates the track while Ronson plays a similar line on guitar.

&quot;The Prettiest Star&quot; was originally released in 1970 as the follow-up single to &quot;Space Oddity&quot; (1969). It was written for Bowie&#x27;s first wife Angela Barnett, whom he married shortly after the original&#x27;s release. The subsequent rerecording on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; was glam-influenced, and featured Marc Bolan&#x27;s original guitar part mimicked almost note-for-note by Ronson. Buckley calls the rerecording a &quot;revamped and much improved&quot; version. Doggett argues that the song appeared out of place on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, while Pegg finds that the references to &quot;screen starlets&quot; and &quot;the movies in the past&quot; mesh with the album&#x27;s other nostalgic references.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; is the only cover song on the album. Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and recorded by the Rolling Stones in 1967, the song&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; acknowledges the influence of the Stones on the entire record. While the original was psychedelic, Bowie&#x27;s rendition is faster, raunchier and more glam-influenced. It features synthesisers that Pegg believes give the track a &quot;fresh, futuristic sheen&quot;. Several critics also consider it a gay appropriation of a heterosexual song. The cover has been criticised in the ensuing decades as camp and unsatisfying.

&quot;The Jean Genie&quot; began as an impromptu jam titled &quot;Bussin&#x27;&quot; on the charter bus when travelling between Cleveland and Memphis. The Bo Diddley-inspired guitar riff is a variation of the Yardbirds&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; and &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot;. Bowie called it &quot;a smorgasbord of imagined Americana&quot; and his &quot;first New York song&quot;, he wrote the lyrics to &quot;entertain&quot; Warhol associate Cyrinda Foxe, who appeared in the song&#x27;s accompanied music video. The music is heavily blues-influenced, leading Perone to contest: &quot;This piece exudes the British blues spirit like no previous Bowie song.&quot; The lyrics were also an ode to Iggy Pop, Bowie calling the song&#x27;s character a &quot;white-trash, kind of trailer-park kid thing – the closet intellectual who wouldn&#x27;t want the world to know that he reads&quot;.

&quot;Lady Grinning Soul&quot; was one of the final songs written for the album. It was also a last-minute addition, replacing the &quot;sax version&quot; of &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot; as the closing track. A possible inspiration for the song is American soul singer Claudia Lennear, whom Bowie met during the US tour and also inspired the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, although the critic Chris O&#x27;Leary argues that the inspiration was the French singer Amanda Lear, a sometime girlfriend of Bowie&#x27;s. Unlike other tracks on the album, &quot;Lady Grinning Soul&quot; has a sexual ambiance, lushness and serenity, and features flamenco-style guitar from Ronson and a Latin-style piano part from Garson. The track has been described as a lost James Bond theme.

== Title and artwork ==
The title is a pun on &quot;A Lad Insane&quot;, which at one point was expected to be the title. When writing the album during the tour, it was under the working title &quot;Love Aladdin Vein&quot;, which Bowie said at the time felt right, but decided to change it partly due to its drug connotations.

The cover artwork features a shirtless Bowie with red hair and a red-and-blue lightning bolt splitting his face in two while a teardrop runs down his collarbone. It was shot in January 1973 by Brian Duffy in his north London studio. In an effort to ensure RCA promoted the album extensively, Bowie&#x27;s manager Tony Defries was determined to make the cover as costly as possible. He insisted on an unprecedented seven-colour system, rather than the usual four. The image was the most expensive cover art ever made at the time. The make-up designer was artist Pierre Laroche, who remained Bowie&#x27;s make-up artist for the remainder of the 1973 tour and the &quot;Pin Ups&quot; cover shoot. Cann writes that Duffy and Laroche copied the lightning bolt from a National Panasonic rice-cooker in the studio. The make-up was completed with a &quot;deathly purple wash&quot;, which Cann believes, together with Bowie&#x27;s closed eyes, evoke a &quot;death mask&quot;. The final photo was selected from a group featuring Bowie looking directly at the camera. These photos later became a signature image of the V&amp;A&#x27;s &quot;David Bowie Is&quot; exhibition. The shoot was the only time Bowie wore the design on his face, but it was later used for hanging backdrops at live performances.

Duffy believed that Bowie&#x27;s inspiration for the &quot;flash&quot; design came from a ring once worn by Elvis Presley; it featured the letters TCB (an acronym for Taking Care of Business) with a lightning flash. Pegg believes the cover has a deeper meaning, representing the &quot;split down the middle&quot; personality of the Aladdin Sane character and reflecting Bowie&#x27;s split feelings regarding the US tour and his newfound stardom. The teardrop on his chest was Duffy&#x27;s idea; Bowie said the photographer &quot;just popped it in there. I thought it was rather sweet.&quot; It was airbrushed by Philip Castle, who also helped create the silvery effect on Bowie&#x27;s body on the sleeve. Regarded as one of the most iconic images of Bowie, it was called &quot;the Mona Lisa of album covers&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Mick McCann and one of the 50 greatest album covers of all time by &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2022. Pegg calls it &quot;perhaps the most celebrated image of Bowie&#x27;s long career&quot;.

Upon release, the cover was polarising. According to Cann, some were offended and bewildered at Bowie&#x27;s appearance, while others found it daring. Henry Edwards of &quot;The New York Times&quot; initially described the image as &quot;the most cunning representation to date of this angel-faced, 25-year-old, English composer-performer as a disembodied spirit of the Space Age&quot;. In retrospect, Cann argues that a cover like &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;″s can be a risky move for artists whose success is relatively recent. Later publications have compared the lightning bolt design to that of the flag of the British Union of Fascists.

== Release ==
RCA issued &quot;The Jean Genie&quot; as the lead single on 24November 1972. In its advertising, the label said it was &quot;the first single to come from Bowie&#x27;s triumphant American tour&quot;. The song charted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, making it Bowie&#x27;s biggest hit to date. The single fared worse in the US, reaching number 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was promoted with a video by Mick Rock, featuring bits of concert footage shot in San Francisco in late October 1972, interspersed with shots of Bowie posing around the Mars Hotel and actress Cyrinda Foxe. The second single, &quot;Drive-In Saturday&quot;, was released in the UK on 6April 1973. Like the previous single, it was a commercial success, peaking at number three in the UK. &quot;Time&quot; was issued as a single in the US and Japan in April, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot; in the US and Europe in July. In 1974, Lulu released a version of &quot;Watch That Man&quot; as the B-side to her single &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, produced by Bowie and Ronson.

&quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; was released in the UK through RCA on 19April 1973. With a purported 100,000 copies ordered in advance, the LP debuted at the top of the UK Albums Chart, where it remained for five weeks. In the US, where Bowie already had three albums on the charts, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, making it Bowie&#x27;s most successful record commercially in both countries to that date. According to Pegg, this feat was unheard of at the time and guaranteed &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;″s status as Britain&#x27;s best-selling album since &quot;the days of the Beatles&quot;. Elsewhere, the album reached the top five in France, the Netherlands and Sweden, and the top ten in Australia. &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; is estimated to have sold 4.6 million copies worldwide, making it one of Bowie&#x27;s highest-selling LPs. &quot;The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums&quot; notes that Bowie &quot;ruled the [British] album chart, accumulating an unprecedented 182 weeks on the list in 1973 with six different titles.&quot; Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; reentered the US charts, reaching number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Catalog Albums chart the week of 29January 2016, where it remained for three weeks. It also peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Vinyl Albums the week of 18 March 2016, remaining on the chart for four weeks.

== Critical reception ==
Critical reaction to &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; was generally laudatory, if more enthusiastic in the US than in the UK. Ben Gerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked on &quot;Bowie&#x27;s provocative melodies, audacious lyrics, masterful arrangements (with Mick Ronson) and production (with Ken Scott)&quot;, and pronounced it &quot;less manic than &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot;, and less intimate than &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, with none of its attacks of self-doubt.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a combination of &quot;raw energy with explosive rock&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Edwards described &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; as &quot;the most expressive, if still uneven, album of his recording career&quot;. In the British music press, letters columns accused Bowie of &#x27;selling out&#x27; and &quot;Let It Rock&quot; magazine found the album to be more style than substance, considering that he had &quot;nothing to say and everything to say it with&quot;. Similarly, Kim Fowley of &quot;Phonograph Record&quot; considered the record bad, save for &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Prettiest Star&quot;. Fowley found the record&#x27;s flaws to be &quot;over-verbalised multi-symbolistic lyrics&quot;, not enough collaboration with Ronson when making it and the presence of Garson on piano.

Other British writers gave more positive assessments, with Val Mabbs of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; citing it as Bowie&#x27;s best work up to that point. Also writing for &quot;Phonograph Record&quot;, Ron Ross stated that with the record, Bowie has proven himself to be &quot;one of the most consistent and fast-moving artists since the Beatles&quot;. Ross considered side one &quot;the tightest, and probably the best, work Bowie has ever recorded&quot;. Writer Charles Shaar Murray of the &quot;NME&quot; felt &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; was a strong contender for album of the year, further calling it &quot;a worthy contribution to the most important body of musical work produced in this decade&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau wrote a few years later that his favorite Bowie album had been &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, &quot;the fragmented, rather second-hand collection of elegant hard rock songs (plus one Jacques Brel-style clinker) that fell between the &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; concepts. That Bowie improved his music by imitating the Rolling Stones rather than by expressing himself is obviously a tribute to the Stones, but it also underlines how expedient Bowie&#x27;s relationship to rock and roll has always been.&quot;

==Subsequent events==

In February 1973, shortly after &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; was completed, Bowie and the band returned to the road for the final portion of the Ziggy Stardust Tour, which Pegg refers to as the &quot;Aladdin Sane Tour&quot;. The same personnel from the album returned for the tour, with the addition of guitarist John Hutchinson, who had previously performed with Bowie in various projects throughout the late 1960s. With the exception of &quot;Lady Grinning Soul&quot;, all tracks from &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; were added to the setlist. Bowie drastically increased his stage demeanor for this portion of the tour, becoming more open and ambiguous compared to the shy persona of previous performances. He also underwent numerous costume changes during the shows, even representing the Aladdin Sane character through the use of mime and masks.

This portion of the tour commenced in the United States before continuing to Japan in April. Bowie&#x27;s stage presence was praised by Japanese audiences and reviewers. On his arrival back to the UK in early May, where &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; had just topped the chart, Bowie&#x27;s popularity had soared in his home country; the final UK leg of the tour sold out completely. The UK leg made small setlist changes and introduced backdrop banners containing the blue and red lightning bolt Bowie donned on the &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; cover artwork. Despite a disastrous first show at London&#x27;s Earls Court Arena, the remaining dates were successful, receiving acclaim from reviewers and audiences.

The final date of the tour was 3July 1973, which was performed at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. The performance was documented by filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker in a documentary and concert film, which premiered in 1979 and commercially released in 1983 as &quot;Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;, with an accompanying soundtrack album titled &quot;Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture&quot;. At this show, Bowie made the sudden surprise announcement that the show would be &quot;the last show that we&#x27;ll ever do&quot;, later understood to mean that he was retiring his Ziggy Stardust persona. Although Ronson was told in advance, Bolder and Woodmansey were not, which led to rising tensions between the two and Bowie. Additional conflicts regarding compensation led to Woodmansey&#x27;s dismissal from the Spiders in July. Bowie&#x27;s next album, &quot;Pin Ups&quot;—a covers album devised as a &quot;stop-gap&quot; record to appease RCA—was recorded during the summer of 1973, released in October, and was Bowie&#x27;s final album recorded with the Spiders, by then comprising only Ronson and Bolder.

==Legacy==

Retrospectively, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; has received positive reviews from music critics but most reviewers have unfavorably compared it to its predecessor. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic believed that &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; followed the same pattern as &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, but for &quot;both better and worse&quot;. While he praised the album for presenting unusual genres and being lyrically different, he criticised Bowie&#x27;s cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot;, calling it &quot;oddly clueless&quot;, and contended that &quot;there&#x27;s no distinctive sound or theme to make [a cohesive record]; it&#x27;s Bowie riding the wake of Ziggy Stardust, which means there&#x27;s a wealth of classic material here, but not enough focus to make the album itself a classic&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Douglas Wolk also found it too similar to its predecessor, calling it &quot;effectively &quot;Ziggy Stardust II&quot;, a harder-rocking if less original variation on the hit album&quot;. He writes that while &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; ended with a &quot;vision of outreach to the front row&quot; in the lyrics of &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot;, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; is &quot;all alienation and self-conscious artifice, parodic gestures of intimacy directed to the theater balcony&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; editors Roy Carr and Murray called the album &quot;oddly unsatisfying, considerably less than the sum of the parts&quot;. In a 2013 readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; was voted Bowie&#x27;s sixth best record. The magazine argued that it proved Bowie was not a &quot;one-album wonder&quot;.

Like music critics, Bowie&#x27;s biographers have mostly compared &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; to its predecessor unfavourably. Pegg writes that it feels more rushed than &quot;Ziggy&quot;. Carr and Murray contend that &quot;It was all too obvious that the heat was on... The songs were written too fast, recorded too fast and mixed too fast.&quot; Marc Spitz states that Bowie might have moved on from the Ziggy persona sooner had it not been for the pressure from his music publisher MainMan. Despite the record being critically viewed as inferior to its predecessor, Spitz calls it one of Bowie&#x27;s classics and the songs &quot;top-notch&quot;, and felt it ultimately showed that at the time Bowie was &quot;still way ahead of the game&quot;. Pegg calls it &quot;one of the most urgent, compelling and essential of Bowie&#x27;s albums&quot;.
Biographer Paul Trynka describes it as both &quot;slicker and sketchier&quot; than &quot;Ziggy&quot;, and argues that &quot;[it] is in some ways a more convincing document on the nature of fame and show business than [its predecessor]&quot;. Doggett similarly describes &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; as arguably a more &quot;real&quot; and &quot;rewarding&quot; album than its predecessor, with a &quot;Stones-inspired, vivid production&quot; outdoing the &quot;somewhat flat sonic canvas&quot; of &quot;Ziggy&quot;, but concludes that while &quot;Ziggy&quot; is more than the sum of its parts and has a long-lasting legacy, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; is &quot;its songs, its sleeve, and nothing more&quot;. Perone finds the record not as accessible as its predecessor, deducing that with less &quot;melodic and harmonic hooks&quot; and lyrics that are &quot;darker and more inwardly focused and analytical&quot;, the result is an album that is &quot;not as well remembered&quot; as &quot;Ziggy&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Joe Lynch considered &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; just as influential on glam rock as a whole as its predecessor. He states that both records &quot;ensured [Bowie&#x27;s] long-term career and infamy&quot; and argues that both &quot;transcended&quot; the genre, are &quot;works of art&quot;, and are not just &quot;glam classics&quot;, but &quot;rock classics&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; was ranked among six Bowie entries on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (at number 277), and 279 in a 2012 revised list. It was later ranked 77th on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of the top 100 albums of the 1970s. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album 230th in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was also included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissues==
&quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; has been reissued several times. Although the original 1973 vinyl release featured a gatefold cover, some later LP versions such as RCA&#x27;s 1980 US reissue presented the album in a standard non-gatefold sleeve. The album was first released on CD in 1984 by RCA. In 1990, Dr. Toby Mountain at Northeastern Digital, Southborough, Massachusetts, remastered &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; from the original master tapes for Rykodisc, released with no bonus tracks. It was again remastered in 1999 by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios for EMI and Virgin Records, and once more released with no bonus tracks.

In 2003, a two-disc version was released by EMI/Virgin. The second in a series of &quot;30th Anniversary 2CD Edition&quot; sets (along with &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;), this release includes a remastered version of the album on the first disc. The second disc contains ten tracks, a few of which had been previously released on the 1989 collection &quot;Sound + Vision&quot;. A 40th anniversary edition, remastered by Ray Staff at London&#x27;s AIR Studios, was released in CD and digital download formats in April 2013. This 2013 remaster of the album was included in the 2015 box set &quot;Five Years 1969–1973&quot; and rereleased separately, in 2015–2016, in CD, vinyl and digital formats. A 12&quot; limited edition of the 2013 remaster, pressed in silver vinyl, was released in 2018 to mark the 45th anniversary of the album. To celebrate its 50th anniversary, the album was reissued on 14 April 2023 in vinyl picture disc and half-speed-mastered versions.

<doc id="195840" wikidata="Q332041" url="?curid=195840" title="José Clemente Orozco">
<text>José Clemente Orozco (November 23, 1883 – September 7, 1949) was a Mexican caricaturist and painter, who specialized in political murals that established the Mexican Mural Renaissance together with murals by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and others. Orozco was the most complex of the Mexican muralists, fond of the theme of human suffering, but less realistic and more fascinated by machines than Rivera. Mostly influenced by Symbolism, he was also a genre painter and lithographer. Between 1922 and 1948, Orozco painted murals in Mexico City, Orizaba, Claremont, California, New York City, Hanover, New Hampshire, Guadalajara, Jalisco, and Jiquilpan, Michoacán.

== Life ==
José Clemente Orozco was born in 1883 in Zapotlán el Grande (now Ciudad Guzmán), Jalisco to Rosa de Flores Orozco. He was the oldest of his siblings. In 1890 Orozco became interested in art after moving to Mexico City. He married Margarita Valladares, and had three children. At the age of 21, Orozco lost his left hand while working with gunpowder to make fireworks.

The satirical illustrator José Guadalupe Posada, whose engravings about Mexican culture and politics challenged Mexicans to think differently about post-revolutionary Mexico, worked in full view of the public in shop windows located on the way Orozco went to school. In his autobiography, Orozco confesses, &quot;I would stop [on my way to and from school] and spend a few enchanted minutes in watching [Posada]... This was the push that first set my imagination in motion and impelled me to cover paper with my earliest little figures; this was my awakening to the existence of the art of painting.&quot; He goes on to say that watching Posada&#x27;s engraving decorated gave him his introduction to the use of color. After attending school for Agriculture and Architecture, Orozco studied art at the Academy of San Carlos in 1906–1914. Orozco participated at the 1911 student&#x27;s strike along with fellow student and future muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. He worked as an illustrator for Mexico City newspapers, and directly as an illustrator for one of the Constitutionalist armies overseen by &quot;First Chief&quot; Venustiano Carranza. One of the greatest influences on Orozco in his adult years was Dr. Atl&#x27;s view on Symbolism. In 1914, Orozco followed Dr. Atl to Orizaba when the competing armies were about to enter the city. When the revolutionary factions split in 1914 after Victoriano Huerta was ousted, Orozco supported Carranza and General Álvaro Obregón against Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. The violence he witnessed profoundly affected his life and art. &quot;The world was torn apart around us&quot;, he wrote in his autobiography. &quot;Troop convoys passed on their way to slaughter. Trains were blown up.&quot;

In 1916, Orozco, disappointed by the review he received in Mexico about his art, went to the United States. Four years later Orozco came back to Mexico City and began working as a cartoonist. In July 1923, Orozco begun to work on his first mural project aided by Vasconcelos, he participated in the revolutionary war and his paintings reflected his view on the dark essence of the war.

With Diego Rivera, he was a leader of the artist movement known as Mexican Muralism. An important distinction he had from Rivera was his darker view of the Mexican Revolution. While Rivera was a bold, optimistic figure, touting the glory of the revolution, Orozco was less comfortable with the bloody toll the social movement was taking. Orozco is known as one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; muralists along with Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros. All three artists, as well as the painter Rufino Tamayo, experimented with fresco on large walls, and elevated the art of the mural.

Between 1922 and 1924, Orozco painted the murals &quot;Maternity&quot;, &quot;Man in Battle Against Nature&quot;, &quot;Christ Destroys His Cross&quot;, &quot;Destruction of the Old Order&quot;, &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;, &quot;The Trench&quot; and &quot;The Trinity&quot; at the National Preparatory School. Some of the murals were destroyed by Orozco himself, and later repainted. Others were vandalized by conservative students and practically destroyed. Thus, Orozco had to repaint many of them when he came back to the School in 1926. In 1925, he painted the mural &quot;Omniscience&quot; at Mexico City&#x27;s House of Tiles. The following year, he painted a mural at the Industrial School in Orizaba, Veracruz.
Between 1927 and 1934, Orozco lived in the USA. Even after the fall of the stock market in 1929, his works were still in demand. From March to June 1930, at the invitation of the Pomona College Art Department, he painted what he noted was the &quot;first fresco painted outside the country by a painter of the Contemporary Mexican School&quot;. The fresco, &quot;Prometheus&quot; (Prometeo del Pomona College), on the wall of Pomona&#x27;s Frary Dining Hall, was direct and personal at a time when murals were expected to be decorous and decorative and have been called the first &quot;modern&quot; fresco in the United States.
Later that year, he painted murals at the New School for Social Research, New York City, now known as The New School. One of his most famous murals is &quot;The Epic of American Civilization&quot; at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, USA. It was painted between 1932 and 1934 and covers almost 300 m2 (3200 square feet) in 24 panels. Its parts include: &quot;Migrations&quot;, &quot;Human Sacrifices&quot;, &quot;The Appearance of Quetzalcoatl&quot;, &quot;Corn Culture&quot;, &quot;Anglo-America&quot;, &quot;Hispano-America&quot;, &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Modern Migration of the Spirit&quot; (another version of &quot;Christ Destroys His Cross&quot;). His work was also part of the Art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

After returning to Mexico, in 1934 Orozco painted a mural, &quot;The Catharsis&quot;, at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City.
Remaining in Mexico, Orozco painted in Guadalajara, Jalisco, the mural &quot;The People and Their False Leaders&quot; in the Government Palace. The frescos for the Hospicio Cabañas, which are considered his masterpiece. In 1940 he painted at the Gabino Ortiz Library in Jiquilpan, Michoacán. Between 1942 and 1944 Orozco painted for the Hospital de Jesús in Mexico City. Orozco&#x27;s 1948 &quot;Juárez Reborn&quot; huge portrait-mural was one of his last works.

In 1947, he illustrated the book &quot;The Pearl&quot;, by John Steinbeck.

While still residing in Mexico City, Orozco died in his sleep on September 7, 1949, aged 65. The cause of his death was heart failure.
==Dartmouth Mural==
Orozco painted his fresco &quot;The Epic of American Civilization&quot; in the lower level of Dartmouth College&#x27;s Baker Memorial Library. Jose Orozco&#x27;s &quot;Epic of American Civilization&quot; is under the supervision of the Hood Art Museum.
==Escuela Nacional Preparatoria==

===History and overview===

José Clemente Orozco&#x27;s mural series in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria at San Ildefonso College spans three floors of the building and includes multiple other murals in the stairway, all of which depict his critical view of the Revolution. The Escuela Nacional Preparatoria commissioned him in February 1923; however, his earlier panels created serious political conflict, causing him to cease his work, like Siqueiros&#x27;. He later returned to finish the work he began under a new wave of social change in 1926.

===First-floor murals===
On the first floor of the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria are a series of murals, including &quot;The Trench&quot;, &quot;The Destruction of the Old Order&quot;, &quot;Maternity&quot;, &quot;The Strike&quot;, &quot;The Trinity&quot;, and &quot;The Banquet of the Rich&quot;. The first image is &quot;located under the central arch of the ground floor of the north wall and is the only wall section perfectly framed by the colonnade from the vantage point of the center of the courtyard&quot; and is called &quot;The Trench&quot;. A unique aspect of the first floor murals is that each mural parallels in width to the arched openings of the colonnade. &quot;The Destruction of the Old Order&quot; and &quot;Maternity&quot; are located to the right of &quot;The Trench&quot;. To the left of &quot;The Trench&quot; are &quot;The Strike&quot;, &quot;The Trinity&quot;, and at the intersection of the west corridor is &quot;The Banquet of the Rich&quot;. Among the murals that Orozco destroyed are &quot;The Elements&quot;, &quot;Man Struggling Against Nature&quot;, &quot;Man Falling&quot;, and &quot;Christ Destroying His Cross&quot;. An interesting element of the destroyed mural &quot;Christ Destroying His Cross&quot;, of which Orozco only kept Christ&#x27;s head, is that he reverted to the use of Christian iconography: Christ is destroying his cross in agony over its misuse as a symbol.

&quot;The Trench&quot; is described as a &quot;confirmation of what an extraordinary and powerful painter Orozco would turn out to be&quot; and is compared to the mural &quot;The Farewell&quot;, &quot;where the initial impression is of a bloody action scene of great melodrama.&quot; He uses jarring muted tones of a darker palette, which matches the dark theme portrayed. Orozco promotes a dignified view of death, as the viewer sees three men sacrificing themselves. Two of the men appear to have died, even though no wounds are present on their bodies, and a third is kneeling while covering his face with his left arm. Their faces are hidden, which gives the viewer a sense of anonymity behind the sacrifice of the many victims of the revolution. This poses the question, is the sacrifice of many worth anything? It makes their anonymous identity more powerful than if they had recognizable identities, because they now represent the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of men who fought and died for the same reason. There is also a component of Christian iconography in this mural, as the central man leans spread eagle against a barricade of rocks and beams that resemble a cross, which contributes to the mural&#x27;s balance but not in a symmetrical way. This is an allusion to the crucifix, with the central soldier playing the role of the martyr, which is further exemplified by his lack weapons. Analysis of this mural and many other murals by Orozco about the Mexican Revolution is summed up by a statement by Antonio Rodríguez, which states &quot;Orozco showed its...tragedy.&quot;

&quot;The Trinity&quot; is a negative image of the revolution in which a revolutionary leader is the central figure in the mural, &quot;blinded by the red Jacobian hat of the revolution&quot; and threatening the very people he is supposed to be fighting for. The peasant on the right is on his knees begging for mercy while the peasant on the left, whose hands have been severed from the wrist down, watches. This displays the situation of the working class, who have been recruited to fight and do not know who they are fighting or why they are fighting at all.

&quot;The Banquet of the Rich&quot; displays Orozco&#x27;s caricature style. It is a depiction of social criticism through the use of satire. In this mural, the viewer sees a depiction of the rich, whose faces and bodies are obviously distorted, which is meant &quot;to represent their decadence and abuses of power&quot; and the working class. It is meant to portray the situation of the working class as oppressed by the rich and in a state of war with one another. This point is further exemplified by the view of the rich who can look down on the working class and continue to live a life of decadence without consequences. This displays the workers as completely blind to their situation by acting as gladiators for the entertainment of the rich. Tools held by the working class individuals in this murals are being used as weapons, which shows &quot;the workers are turning the objects of their livelihood against themselves, have not acquired real weapons and are caught up in confusion about what people and things are really for, treating comrades like enemies.&quot; While this mural is not aesthetically pleasing, with its repulsive distorted characters, it evokes thought within the spectator about their personal situation as a member of the working class or of the privileged bourgeois.
===Second floor murals===
The second story of murals by Orozco in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, which were painted in 1923–24, includes the murals &quot;Law and Justice&quot;, &quot;Jehovah Between the Rich and the Poor&quot;, &quot;Liberty&quot;, &quot;Garbage,&quot; and &quot;The Rich&quot;, which are listed in order from left to right.

===Third floor murals===
The third story, created between 1924 and 1926, includes the murals, &quot;Women&quot;, &quot;The Grave Digger&quot;, &quot;The Blessing&quot;, &quot;The Workers&quot;, &quot;The Farewell&quot;, &quot;The Family&quot;, and &quot;The Revolutionaries&quot;.

&quot;The Farewell&quot; is grandiose in scale and displays the final moments before the sacrifice of the Revolution. The landscape is somber, as is the expression behind the leftward earthbound woman, who appears to be the man&#x27;s mother or grandmother. There are three pairs present in this mural: the leftward couple of the elderly woman and the man who kisses her hand, another couple locked in a final embrace, and a third one of two stooping men. The rhythmic pairing suggests a shared identity of the men who are leaving to fight the Revolution. &quot;What this treatment does to history, to real events such as departing to fight a revolution, is to turn it into a natural (that is, of nature), inevitable, and timeless event, or not an event at all but a condition about which humans can do nothing to change since the condition is made of them and vice versa.&quot;

===Stairway murals===

Additional murals, completed by Orozco in 1924–1926, are &quot;painted on the walls and rising overheads of the ground floor,&quot; including &quot;Aboriginal Races&quot;, &quot;Franciscans Helping the Sick&quot;, &quot;The Youth&quot; and &quot;Cortés and Malinche&quot;. &quot;The Drinking Men&quot; and &quot;The Engineers&quot; encase the stairway on the east wall of the courtyard.
&quot;Cortés and Malinche&quot; is a dignified view of the creation of the first mestizo, a result of the Spanish colonialism in Mexico. &quot;This union between the Spanish European conquistador and his female Indian mistress was an incontestable historical fact&quot; and is demonstrated as the two bodies join into one. Their bodies are Michelangelo-like as they represent the &quot;Old World man and a New World woman.&quot; Orozoco works to represent the inequities present between this relationship by portraying Cortés&#x27; gestures as domineering and Malinche&#x27;s as subordinate. Cortés&#x27; gesture of placing his arm across Malinche&#x27;s torso, &quot;both prevents an act of supplication for the Indian on Malinche&#x27;s part and acts as a final separation from her former life.&quot; This image serves as a synthesis of the Spanish colonization of Mexico, the critical role Malinche played, and the beginning of the mestizo in Mexican history.

<text>Puerto Vallarta ( or simply Vallarta) is a Mexican beach resort city on the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s Bahía de Banderas in the Mexican state of Jalisco. Puerto Vallarta is the second largest urban agglomeration in the state after the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area. The City of Puerto Vallarta is the government seat of the Municipality of Puerto Vallarta, which comprises the city as well as population centers outside of the city extending from Boca de Tomatlán to the Nayarit border (the Ameca River). The city is located at . The municipality has an area of . To the north, it borders the southwest of the state of Nayarit. To the east, it borders the municipality of Mascota and San Sebastián del Oeste, and to the south, it borders the municipalities of Talpa de Allende and Cabo Corrientes.

Puerto Vallarta is named after Ignacio Vallarta, a former governor of Jalisco. In Spanish, &quot;Puerto Vallarta&quot; is frequently shortened to &quot;Vallarta&quot;, while English speakers call the city P.V. for short. In Internet shorthand, the city is often referred to as PVR, after the International Air Transport Association airport code for its Gustavo Diaz Ordaz International Airport.

==History==
=== Playa Los Muertos (Beach of the Dead) ===

In the 16th century, Hernán Cortés explored the Pacific side of Mexico by ship. Cortés used the established port of Acapulco to resupply and anchor his ships along the journey. During the early 1500s, he sent two of his ships North to explore the coastline without him. One of his ships wrecked in Banderas Bay and all but three men were reportedly killed. It is believed the corpses of the lost sailors washed ashore. Native villagers encountered numerous corpses on the beach for days after the wreck.

=== Bahía de Banderas (Bay of Flags) ===
Pirates were known to attack ships along the Pacific Coast of Mexico as early as the 16th century. In the early 1500s the famous explorer Hernán Cortés set out to establish a safe harbor, north of Acapulco, to provide protection for cargo ships sailing the planned Manila galleon trade route to the Philippines. Just several hundred miles north, he discovered a large bay at the village of Tintoque. According to local legend, pirates were already anchoring in this bay and regularly pillaged local villagers while burying treasure in the hills. When Cortes and his crew set foot on the beach, a mob of angry villagers believed he and his crew were pirates and surrounded them with native weapons in hand. According to his journal, a Catholic friar accompanying the crew began praying to the Lord for help. Villagers were mesmerized by the red flags the crew carried and suddenly lowered their weapons, allowing the explorers to pass peacefully. It&#x27;s likely the villagers had seen the flags before when they floated ashore with the dead crew from a Cortés&#x27; ship that wrecked earlier in the bay. This is how the Bahía de Banderas was named. Francisco Cortés de Buenaventura, the nephew of Hernán Cortés, is said to have formalized the bay&#x27;s name during his own conquering of the region in 1525. In the following years, Tintoque became a major port and safe harbor for ships traveling the Manila galleon.

===Pre-Hispanic times to the 19th century===

Few details are known about the history of the area prior to the 19th century. There is archaeological evidence to suggest continuous human habitation from 580 BC, and similar evidence (from sites near Ixtapa and in Col. Lázaro Cárdenas) that the area belonged to the Aztlán culture which dominated Jalisco, Nayarit and Michoacán from . The limited evidence in occidental Mexican archeology have limited the current knowledge about pre-historic life in the area.

===El Carrizal and Las Peñas – 19th century ===

The official founding story of Las Peñas and thus of Puerto Vallarta is that it was founded by Guadalupe Sánchez Torres, his wife Ambrosia Carrillo and some friends such as Cenobio Joya, Apolonio de Robles, Cleofas Peña and Martín Andrade, among others, on December 12, 1851, and was given the name of Las Peñas de Santa María de Guadalupe since it was the day dedicated to the virgin of Guadalupe. Although the purchase record of the property by Guadalupe Sanchez is dated 1859, his family lived there prior to the purchase year.

There is however no doubt the development of Las Peñas into a self-sustaining village of any significant size happened in the 1860s as the mouth of the Cuale area was exploited to support the operations of the newly enfranchised Union en Cuale company. As such 1859 marks the beginning of Puerto Vallarta as a village. Twenty years later, by 1885, the village comprised about 250 homes and about 800 residents.

===The modern resort – 20th century to present===
The Mexican government invested significantly in transportation improvements, making Puerto Vallarta an easy travel destination. To make Puerto Vallarta accessible by jet aircraft the government developed the city&#x27;s international airport. Ground transportation significantly improved. Government invested heavily in the development of highway and utility infrastructure. Another vital improvement for the city was the El Salado wharf (where the current cruise terminal is), inaugurated on June 1, 1970, making Puerto Vallarta Jalisco&#x27;s first harbor town.

During the mid-1980s, Puerto Vallarta experienced a rapid expansion of impromptu communities poorly served by even basic public services. This very low standard of living leveled out Puerto Vallarta&#x27;s resort boom. In the late 1980s Puerto Vallarta&#x27;s government worked to alleviate the situation by developing housing and infrastructure. But the legacy of the 1980s boom remains, as the outlying areas of Puerto Vallarta suffer from poor provision of basic services (i.e. water, sewage, roads).

==Geography==

Puerto Vallarta lies on a narrow coastal plain at the foot of the Sierras Cuale and San Sebastián, parts of the Sierra Madre Occidental. The plain widens to the north, reaching its widest point along the Ameca river. Three rivers flow from the Sierra through the area. From south to north they are the Cuale, the Pitillal, and the Ameca. A number of arroyos also run from the Sierra to the coastal plain. Many of the valleys of these rivers and arroyos are inhabited. Also development has to some extent spread up the hillsides from the coastal plain.

The city proper comprises four main areas: the hotel zone along the shore to the north, Olas Altas – Colonia Emiliano Zapata to the south of the Cuale river (recently named &quot;Zona Romántica&quot; in some tourist brochures), the &quot;Centro&quot; along the shore between these two areas, and a number of residential areas to the east of the hotel zone. The oldest section of the town is the area of Col. Centro near the church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, especially Hidalgo street.

===Seismic history===
Puerto Vallarta, like much of the west coast of North America, is prone to earthquakes, though Puerto Vallarta tends to experience only peripheral effects of earthquakes centered farther south. On 9 October 1995, an earthquake located off the Colima coast shook the crown from the top of the Roman Catholic Church.

===Climate===
Puerto Vallarta has a Tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;), with dry winters and rainy summers. The average daily high temperature is ; average daily low temperature is ; average daily humidity is 75%. The rainy season extends from mid June through mid October, with most of the rain between July and September. August is the city&#x27;s wettest month, with an average of 14 days with significant precipitation. Even during the rainy season precipitation tends to be concentrated in large rainstorms. Occasional tropical storms will bring thunderstorms to the city in November, though the month is typically dry. There is a marked dry season in the winter. February, March and April are the months with the least cloud cover.

Hurricanes seldom strike Puerto Vallarta. In 2002, Hurricane Kenna, a category 5 hurricane, made landfall about northwest of Puerto Vallarta, and the city suffered some damage from the resulting storm surge. In 1971, Hurricane Lily, a category 1 hurricane, caused serious flooding on the Isla Cuale, prompting the city to relocate all of its residents to the new Colonia Palo Seco.

===Hurricane Patricia===
Hurricane Patricia, a Category 5 storm, became the most powerful cyclone ever measured in the Western Hemisphere with sustained wind speeds up to . Hurricane Patricia was forecast to make landfall at Puerto Vallarta on the evening of October 23, 2015, with catastrophic damage predicted for the town and surrounding areas and the potential for mud slides. The storm changed from a Category 1 to a Category 5 in just 24 hours, thus catching some vacationers off guard and leaving many trapped in the town. The Jalisco state government put together 30 buses to evacuate tourists from the coast to Guadalajara, a 5-hour ride inland. Manzanillo, Colima was also near the forecast catastrophic damage zone. Ultimately, Patricia weakened and made landfall south of Puerto Vallarta, sparing the city from any significant damage.

==Economy==
Nearly 80% of the workforce is employed in tourist related industries: hotels, restaurants, personal services, and transportation.

===Tourism trends===
Tourism in Puerto Vallarta has increased steadily over the years and makes up 80% of the city&#x27;s economic activity in 2020. The high season for international tourism in Puerto Vallarta is from late November through March (or later, depending on the timing of the college spring break period in the U.S.) The city is especially popular with U.S. residents from the southern and western U.S. because of the number of direct flights between Puerto Vallarta and Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, Phoenix, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Minneapolis/St Paul and Chicago.

==== Real estate tourism ====

Puerto Vallarta has become a popular retirement destination for U.S. and Canadian retirees. This has created a number of neighborhoods within the Puerto Vallarta region that cater primarily to real estate tourism, such as the Hotel Zone, which stretches from downtown Vallarta to the airport and Marina Vallarta (near the airport), and Amapas and Conchas Chinas, which are built into the mountain slightly south and behind Puerto Vallarta, and overlook the city and bay. Most recently the downtown area, especially in Emiliano Zapata (also known as the Romantic Zone), has seen a somewhat controversial trend of traditional homes being razed for the construction of condominium buildings. This region in recent years has been the most popular for Vallarta real estate tourism, with nearly 25% of all real estate sales for the region taking place there in 2019.

The Puerto Vallarta real estate tourism market is made up of both full-time retirees and second-home owners, primarily from the United States. On average about 40% of buyers are American, with 30% consisting of Mexican nationals, and Canadians and other foreign buyers making up the remaining 20%. Mexicans favor destinations such as Puerto Vallarta, Los Cabos and Cancún not just for the sun and beach, but also as real estate investments, as real estate in these regions is priced in USD, rather than in pesos like the rest of the country.

Puerto Vallarta can be classified as a medium-ranged real estate market with a market consisting mostly of condominiums with an average price around US$320,000 in 2019. Any foreigner wishing to buy real estate in Puerto Vallarta (or anywhere along the coast of Mexico), can&#x27;t own real estate there outright, but needs to establish a &quot;fideicommissum&quot; or beneficial trust which is held with a Mexican bank on the owner&#x27;s behalf. It is not the same as holding the title. The trust is good for 50 years and can be renewed for another 50-year period.

====LGBT tourism====

Puerto Vallarta has developed into Mexico&#x27;s premier resort town as a sort of satellite gay space for the larger state capital, Guadalajara, much as Fire Island is to New York City and Palm Springs is to Los Angeles. It is now considered the most welcoming and gay-friendly destination in the country, dubbed the &quot;San Francisco of Mexico.&quot; Previously quite conservative, the municipal government has become increasingly supportive in recognising and accepting the LGBT tourism segment and supporting LGBT events such as Vallarta gay pride celebrations, which launched in 2013 and are now held annually to coincide with U.S. Memorial Day weekend. It has a gay scene, centered in the city&#x27;s south-side &quot;Zona Romántica&quot;, consisting of hotels and resorts as well as many bars, nightclubs and a gay beach on the main shore. Puerto Vallarta has been cited as the number one gay beach destination in Latin America, with city officials claiming a 5% tourism increase in 2013.

===Population and growth rate for Puerto Vallarta===
The major &quot;suburb&quot; is Bahia de Banderas in Nayarit across state lines, in which Nuevo Vallarta and Sayulita are localities. Ixtapa is a locality in PV, not to be confused with the municipality of Ixtapa in Guerrero state.
sources: (locality &amp; 2015 municipal) (municipal to 2010) sources: &quot;Cuaderno Estadistico Municipal&quot; Censo de Poblacion y Vivienda 2010.

===Growth-related problems===
Poverty remains a problem, fueled by the constant influx of persons seeking employment. Many areas of the city are still poorly served by roads and sewers. For example, Colonia Ramblases is served by roads in generally poor condition only 10% of which are paved, and Ramblases has been a populated neighborhood since the 1940s. The Municipality of Puerto Vallarta comprises about 45,000 regular dwellings. Of those, 10% do not have a potable water supply (carrying their water from a public tap), 8% do not have connections to a sewer system or septic system (using instead crude septic pits or dumping sewage directly into waterways), and 4% do not have electricity. There have been improvements in 2005 to 2007, such as new IMSS facilities in Col. Versalles, improvements to several recreation facilities, improved communal beach access policies, etc. Still efforts seem to aim more at quick and visible infrastructure improvements than at solving the more pressing and enduring problem of insufficient infrastructure for basic services.

One positive result of recent growth has been that in relative terms a smaller percentage of the population lives in older and poorly served neighborhoods. A growing number of residents live in housing projects and low-income housing developments which provide at least adequate basic services.

==Transportation==
The Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport comprises a commercial international section and a general aviation section.

Puerto Vallarta currently has no passenger rail service. Historically, buses connected with nearby Tepic, where there was a passenger rail service on the main north–south trunk of Ferromex. Heading north, trains continued to Nogales, opposite its namesake in Arizona. A spur headed northwest to Mexicali, opposite Calexico, California. Service to the east went to Guadalajara and then to Mexico City.

As of June 2017, Uber began operating in Puerto Vallarta. Their arrival has not been without conflict, as there have been confrontations between them and taxi drivers due to their much lower rates.

==Government==

==Film and television==
*&quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1963) was filmed on location at Mismaloya and other minor locations in the Puerto Vallarta area. The filming brought Richard Burton, Ava Gardner, Deborah Kerr, Tennessee Williams, and Elizabeth Taylor (who was not in the film). The off-screen activities of Burton and Taylor were reported in the tabloids and tabloid newsreels of the day. After filming was completed, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton bought a house in Puerto Vallarta and visited the city regularly while they were married. John Huston decided to build a home in the vicinity, a home on remote Las Caletas beach and a house in town. John Huston&#x27;s children Anjelica Huston and Danny Huston are founders and supporters of the Puerto Vallarta Film Festival (In the film, children are shown selling iguana meat by the roadside).
*&quot;The Love Boat&quot;, regularly featured Puerto Vallarta as a port of call for the fictional version of the &quot;Pacific Princess&quot; cruise ship.
*&quot;The Amazing Race 36&quot; (2024), the starting line was located at a Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts

There are two streets in the Olas Altas area named after the rock formations.
*Playa Conchas Chinas (Curly Shells Beach) – Fraccionamiento Amapas – the city&#x27;s most secluded beach, located to the south of the headland which forms the boundary of Los Muertos beach.
*The Malecón – paved walkway along the seashore in Colonia Centro – especially popular during the Sunday evening &quot;paseo&quot;. It features a collection of contemporary sculptures by Sergio Bustamante, Alejandro Colunga, Ramiz Barquet and others. The Malecon was extensively rebuilt in 2002–2003 following damage from hurricane Kenna. It was also greatly renovated, having new walkways and iconic sculptures in 2010.
*Mercado Isle Cuale and Mercado Municipal Río Cuale – there are two large public markets in the Centro (Downtown) along the banks of the Cuale selling a variety of artisanal and souvenir goods, and the Isla Cuale has a number of souvenir vendor shops as well. The Isla Cuale was also famous for its cat population. The Island was a lower class suburb until flooding during Hurricane Lily (1971) forced residents to be relocated. They were moved to Palo Seco (which means &quot;dry stick&quot;) and the Island was converted into a site for restaurants, shops and a cultural center.
*Cuale Archaeological Museum – on the West side of the &quot;Isla Cuale&quot;, the museum presents a significant collection of local and regional pre-Hispanic art in a number of informative displays. The museum also houses a small gallery for showing contemporary art.

===Landmarks south of Puerto Vallarta===

*Los Arcos National Marine Park – offshore of Mismaloya 12 km south of Puerto Vallarta. The area has been a National Marine Park since 1984. The area is protected as a breeding ground for pelicans, boobies and other sea birds. The park is a popular snorkeling destination both for the rocks themselves and for the fossilized coral beds that surround them.
*Vallarta Botanical Gardens – A popular showcase of orchids, agaves, cactus, palms, and other native plants. A restaurant and river swimming is also available to visitors. The gardens are located South of Puerto Vallarta on Highway 200. Buses for the Vallarta Botanical Gardens depart from the corner of Carranzas and Aguacate Streets in the Zona Romantica and are labeled as both &quot;El Tuito&quot; and &quot;Botanical Gardens&quot;.

In spite of the name, the waves offshore are not particularly high, and the beach is a popular place to swim, especially for locals and national tourists. The beach is lined with outdoor restaurants. 
*Playa de los Muertos (Beach of the Dead) – Colonia Emiliano Zapata – the city&#x27;s largest public beach. Legend has it the beach&#x27;s name (Dead Men&#x27;s Beach) stems from a battle between pirates and local miners after which bodies remained strewn on the beach, but it&#x27;s a legend, since there were never any miners in Vallarta. The South Side of the beach is a popular gathering spot for gay and lesbian tourists. The North end is frequented mostly by locals, and national tourists. The city has recently tried to change the name of the beach to Playa del Sol.

<text>The prime minister of Sweden (, &quot;minister of state&quot;) is the head of government of the Kingdom of Sweden. The prime minister and their cabinet (the government) exercise executive authority in the Kingdom of Sweden and are subject to the Parliament of Sweden. The prime minister is nominated by the speaker of the Riksdag and is elected by the chamber by simple majority, using negative parliamentarianism. The Riksdag holds elections every four years, in the even year between leap years.

As with several other similar offices in Europe, the office of Prime Minister came into existence in the nineteenth century as a result of Sweden&#x27;s democratisation. Prior to the creation of the office, Sweden had no official head of government separate from the king; the country in periods was an absolute monarchy. However, several figures had formerly attained &quot;de facto&quot; status as leader of the government. Today, the prime minister holds the most influential political role in Sweden.

Unlike most prime ministers in parliamentary systems, the prime minister is both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive. This is because the Instrument of Government explicitly vests executive power in the government, of which the prime minister is the leader. The prime minister has two official residences; these are the Sager House and Harpsund.

== History ==
Historically, the monarchy of Sweden served as both head of state and head of government. Examples like Kings Gustav I, Charles XI, and Gustav III showcase how the Swedish government was structured around the monarchy. However, many of these kings had powerful domestic advisors who sometimes took on the role of &quot;de facto&quot; head of government; the most prominent of these examples is Axel Oxenstierna, who played a pivotal role in the formation of the Swedish Empire. The office of Lord High Chancellor was commonly the closest role to a &quot;de jure&quot; head of government, and they had similar responsibilities to the modern Prime Minister during the so-called Age of Liberty; no governmental offices were called Prime Minister at the time.

At the adoption of the new Instrument of Government of 1809, the two offices of Prime Minister for Justice () and Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs () were created, though their roles were no more than just the heads of their respective ministries. When the office of the prime minister was created in 1876, the prime ministers for justice and foreign affairs were thus subsequently demoted to Minister for Justice and Minister for Foreign Affairs. Unlike the minister for justice, the minister for foreign affairs did, however, continue to be styled as &quot;Excellency&quot;, an honour shared only with the prime minister. 
After 1917, it was no longer possible for a monarch to appoint the prime minister and the councillors of state (cabinet ministers) at their own discretion, or keep them in office against the will of the Riksdag. From that time onward, while the king still formally appointed the prime minister, in practice he was required to appoint the leader of the majority party in the Riksdag, or the leader of the senior partner in the majority coalition. While the provision in the Instrument of Government stating that &quot;the King alone shall govern the realm&quot; remained unchanged, it was now understood that the king was required to exercise his powers through the ministers and act on their advice. Over time, the ministers came to &quot;de facto&quot; exercise the royal prerogatives. However, the Swedish term used for the government during this period was still , an abbreviation of &#x27;Royal Majesty&#x27;.

Until 1974, the executive authority in Sweden had been exercised through the King in Council. Constitutional reform provided a new Instrument of Government which &quot;de jure&quot; established the parliamentary system and created a cabinet government with constitutional powers not derived from the Crown. At the same time, it stripped the monarchy of even nominal political powers, making the cabinet the country&#x27;s executive authority in both name and in fact. This codified a number of practices dating from the definitive establishment of parliamentary government in 1917.

==Duties==
The Instrument of Government requires that the prime minister appoint a member of the cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister, to perform the duties of the prime minister if the prime minister cannot. However, if a deputy prime minister is absent or has not been appointed, the senior minister in the cabinet becomes acting head of government. If more than one minister has equal tenure, the eldest assumes the position (see &quot;Swedish governmental line of succession&quot; for the present governmental line of succession).

Constitutionally, the prime minister&#x27;s position is stronger than that of his or her counterparts in Denmark and Norway. Since 1975, the prime minister has been both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive, with powers and duties specifically enumerated in the Instrument of Government. In the two neighboring Scandinavian monarchies, the monarch is the nominal chief executive, but is bound by convention to act on the advice of the ministers. However, the so-called &quot;Torekov Compromise&quot; reached in 1971 by the major political parties, codified with the Instrument of Government that went into effect in 1975, stripped the Swedish monarch of even a nominal role in governmental affairs, thus codifying actual practices that had been in place since the definitive establishment of parliamentary government in 1917.

== Process ==

=== Appointment ===
To appoint a new prime minister, the speaker of the Riksdag holds consultations with party leaders to propose a candidate to be submitted for approval to the Riksdag.

The speaker&#x27;s proposed candidate is then elected through negative parliamentarism. In practice, this means that the prime minister nominee is confirmed if fewer than 175 MPs vote &#x27;no&#x27;, regardless of the number of &#x27;yes&#x27; votes or abstentions. This is described as being &quot;tolerated&quot; by a majority of the Riksdag.

After approval by the Riksdag, the new prime minister-designate must inform the Riksdag which ministers are chosen to make up the new government.

The formal change of government, and thus the start of the term for the new prime minister takes place at a Council of State at the Royal Palace. This is a government meeting chaired by the king, currently Carl XVI Gustaf. During this meeting, the speaker gives an account of the nomination and election process. The King then announces that a change of government has taken place, finalising the appointment of the new prime minister and their government. The handover of the prime minister&#x27;s commission has usually taken place in the Riksdag before the Council of State. In 2022 with the appointment of Ulf Kristersson, however, speaker Andreas Norlén handed it over during the meeting of the Council of State after asking for and receiving the Kings approval to do so, a pure formality.

=== Resignation ===
Whenever a prime minister resigns, dies, or is forced from office by the Riksdag, the speaker of the Riksdag asks the prime minister (or their deputy) to keep the government as a caretaker government until the new government takes office.

With the exception of the prime minister, cabinet ministers ( ) do not need the approval of the Riksdag, but they can be forced to resign by a vote of no confidence. If the prime minister is forced by a vote of no confidence to resign, the entire cabinet falls, and the process of electing a new prime minister starts. The prime minister can dissolve the Riksdag, even after receiving a vote of no confidence, except during the first three months after an election.

==Amenities==

===Office and residences===
The government offices, including the prime minister&#x27;s office, are located at Rosenbad in central Stockholm, straight across the water from the Riksdag building on Helgeandsholmen.

In 1991 Sager House (or the &quot;Sager Palace&quot; as it was previously called) was acquired, and since 1995 it has served as the private residence of the prime minister.

Harpsund, a manor house in Flen Municipality, Södermanland County, has served as a country residence for the prime minister since 1953. The manor is also frequently used for governmental conferences and informal summits between the government, industry and organisations in Sweden.

===Salary===
The salaries of the cabinet ministers, including the prime minister, is decided by and is the subject of annual review by the &#x27;Cabinet Ministers&#x27; Salary Committee&#x27; of the Riksdag. Since 1 January 2022 the prime minister&#x27;s monthly salary is 184,000 SEK.

<doc id="195848" wikidata="Q3157908" url="?curid=195848" title="Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont">
<text>Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont (1 September 1726 – 22 February 1803) was a French &quot;Father of the American Revolution&quot;, but later an opponent of the French Revolution. His son of the same name, known also in America as James Le Ray, eventually became a United States citizen and settled in Le Ray, New York, United States.

==American Revolution==
Le Ray de Chaumont served King Louis XVI at the Court at Versailles as the Governor of Les Invalides in Paris and the Grand Master of Waters and Lands of Blois. Following the Declaration of Independence from Great Britain, by the American colonies on 4 July 1776, emissaries were dispatched to France by the new United States revolutionary government to seek assistance from the French king. Although anxious to see Great Britain weakened, Louis XVI had to walk a political tightrope. He understood that support for the rebellion in America was a contradiction of France&#x27;s global colonization policies and could spark a revolt in any number of France&#x27;s own colonies. As such, the American delegation could not be officially recognized at the French Court.

Sympathetic to the American cause for independence, Le Ray de Chaumont used his powerful position to act as intermediary between the King and the American representatives. But, Le Ray did much more than broker talks and exert influence. In addition to swaying the King and the powerful administrators of the French government, Le Ray provided a fully staffed mansion for Franklin and his family in the wealthy commune of Passy, then outside of Paris.

In December 1776, Benjamin Franklin was sent to Paris with the primary goal of obtaining French aid for the United States. He quickly developed a close relationship with Le Ray and his family and lived at Le Ray&#x27;s estate in Passy for several years. Franklin however did not visit Le Ray&#x27;s luxurious Chateau at Chaumont-sur-Loire in the Loire Valley but his grandson Temple did. As a result of their friendship, Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont helped obtain French support for the American cause with both money and French armed forces.

Along with Benjamin Franklin, Le Ray de Chaumont worked with John Adams, Silas Deane, the Marquis de Lafayette and the Comte de Vergennes to help with the American Revolution. For an aristocrat in that day and age, what Le Ray did for ordinary Americans was astonishing. At heart, he believed in the equality of all men and backed up his beliefs by providing massive amounts of his own money to purchase weapons, supplies and clothing for the fledgling American armed forces. Le Ray was asked by the American government to take charge of the equipment and management of the combined French and American naval fleet. Working closely with Admiral Charles-Hector Estaing, the Commander of the French Fleet, Le Ray&#x27;s support for the American cause involved having his shipyards refit a merchant vessel into a warship that he then gifted to America under the name for use by Captain John Paul Jones.

When the war ended with the treaty of 1783 signed in Paris, Le Ray de Chaumont had a portrait medallion made of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Baptiste Nini. Today, it is Franklin&#x27;s most recognized profile. And, when Franklin was recalled to America in 1785, Le Ray honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by Joseph Siffred Duplessis that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont&#x27;s son named Jacques Le Ray (1760–1840) went to America in 1785. There, he acquired a property in Otsego county, New York where he built the first saw-mill. Known in America as James, the English translation for Jacques, Le Ray Jr. also made large land purchases in the State and on 17 July 1789 he married Grace Coxe from New Jersey and became an American citizen. He signed the marriage bond as Le Ray de Chaumont, but in the body of the instrument his name is entered as James Donatien Le Ray de Chaumontt. The towns of Le Ray, New York, Chaumont, New York and the borough of LeRaysville, Pennsylvania are named after him.

==Aftermath==
In the end, the political ideals that Le Ray de Chaumont cherished came back to haunt him. The huge financial support he had elicited from King Louis XVI for the American Revolutionary War led to massive debts that would bankrupt the government of France. When a drought caused a deep famine in 1788, there was no money available from the French Treasury, as had been done in the past, to subsidize the cost of flour for bread to prevent mass starvation. As a result of France&#x27;s generosity and Le Ray de Chaumont&#x27;s love of America, he inadvertently helped pave the way for the French Revolution, in 1789, that dramatically impacted on his own finances, resulting in the new French Revolutionary government seizing his assets including his beloved Chateau at Chaumont-sur-Loire.

<text>Piedras Negras ( ) is a city and seat of the surrounding municipality of the same name in the Mexican state of Coahuila. It stands at the northeastern edge of Coahuila on the Mexico–United States border, across the Rio Grande from Eagle Pass in the U.S. state of Texas. In the 2015 census the city had a population of 163,595 inhabitants, while the metropolitan area had a population of 245,155 inhabitants. The Piedras Negras and the Eagle Pass areas are connected by the Eagle Pass–Piedras Negras International Bridge, Camino Real International Bridge, and the Union Pacific International Railroad Bridge. 

In Spanish, translates to &#x27;black stones&#x27; – a reference to coal deposits in the area. Across the river, coal was formerly mined on the U.S. side at Dolchburg, near Eagle Pass. This mine closed around 1905, after a fire. Mexico currently operates two large coal-fired power stations named &quot;José López Portillo&quot; and &quot;Carbón 2&quot; located south of Piedras Negras. These two coal-fired power plants are currently operated by Comisión Federal de Electricidad, the state-owned Mexican electric utility.

==History==
On June 15, 1850, a group of 34 men (commanded by Andrés Zapata, Gaspar Salazar and Antonio Ramírez) met with Colonel Juan Manuel Maldonado to give the news that they had created a pass point at Piedras Negras, to the right of the Rio Grande, south of Fort Duncan. They named it Nueva Villa de Herrera, but it later became Villa de Piedras Negras. In Otto Schober&#x27;s &quot;Breve historia de Piedras Negras,&quot; the local historian points out that the 34 men were repatriates (Mexican Americans) who arrived on June 15, 1850, in what was then called &quot;Colonia Militar de Guerrero en Piedras Negras.&quot;

In 1855, the town was looted by a small force of 130 Texans that had been organized by Texas slaveholders for a punitive expedition against a nearby border settlement the Texans claimed contained fugitive slaves and Native Americans. The force was led by a captain of the Texas Rangers. As it happened, the incursion was opposed and &quot;repelled by a superior force of Negroes, Native Americans, and Mexicans who were waiting in ambush&quot; inside Mexico. But the Ranger-led expedition then looted Piedras Negras while returning to Texas.

Following the discovery of huge deposits of coal in the region, in 1881 a railroad track was begun that was completed in 1883. The regional economy flourished and on December 1, 1888, it was granted city status; this time with the name of Ciudad Porfirio Díaz. After the fall of Diaz in 1911, the city reverted to being Piedras Negras, Coahuila.

On April 26, 2004, flooding killed 31 people with up to 60 reported missing.

On April 24, 2007, an F4 tornado struck the city, killing three people there and seven in Eagle Pass, Texas.

From June 14–15, 2013 over 10,000 homes were damaged by flooding and one person was killed.

On the night of June 8, 2018, former Piedras Negras mayor was shot in the back of the head by an unknown man while Purón was taking a selfie with an admirer. Purón died on the spot, becoming the 112th candidate or politician to be killed since Mexico&#x27;s electoral campaign began in September 2017. Purón was supposed to run in the 2018 Mexican election on July 1 as a congressional candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Sonia Villarreal, current mayor of Piedras Negras and fellow member of PRI, suspended her mayoral reelection campaign in response to Purón&#x27;s murder to concentrate on her current duties, stating that &quot;We don&#x27;t (want) his name to be just one more added to the list of candidates who have been victims of these deplorable acts.&quot;

<text>Aschersleben-Staßfurt was a district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany until 2007. It was bounded by (from the northeast and clockwise) the districts of Schönebeck, Bernburg, Mansfelder Land, Quedlinburg and Bördekreis.

== History ==

The two districts of Aschersleben and Staßfurt were merged in 1994 in order to form the new district of Aschersleben-Staßfurt. As part of the reform of 2007 the district was disbanded and the area is now part of the Salzlandkreis district except Falkenstein which now is part of the Harz district.

== Geography ==

The southwestern parts of the district are occupied by the foothills of the Harz Mountains. From here the country slopes away to the Saale valley in the east and the Elbe valley in the northeast. Both rivers don&#x27;t cross the district itself. The two main watercourses are the Bode and the Wipper, both affluents of the Saale.

Apart from the Harz foothills the region is mainly agriculturally used.

<doc id="195856" wikidata="Q386991" url="?curid=195856" title="Torreón">
<text>Torreón () is a city and seat of Torreón Municipality in the Mexican state of Coahuila. As of 2021, the city&#x27;s population was 735,340. The metropolitan population as of 2015 was 1,497,734, making it the ninth-biggest metropolitan area in the country and the largest metropolitan area in the state of Coahuila, as well as one of Mexico&#x27;s most important economic and industrial centers. The cities of Torreón; Gómez Palacio, Durango; Lerdo, Durango; Matamoros; Francisco I. Madero; San Pedro; Bermejillo, Durango; and Tlahualilo, Durango form the area of La Laguna or the Comarca Lagunera, a basin within the Chihuahuan Desert.

The area was originally a center for ranching. With irrigation, the city became an important center for farming and the processing of cotton. In the middle of the 20th century, it became an industrial city. The cities (i.e. the metropolitan area) have industries in textiles, clothing and metals processing. Some important industries and companies have business here, like Peñoles, Motores John Deere, Grupo Lala, Yura Corporation, as well as stores like Soriana, Cimaco, and Extra. There are also several shopping malls in the city, including Galerias Laguna, Almanara, Plaza Cuatro Caminos, and InterMall.

Torreón is served by Francisco Sarabia International Airport, an airport with flights to several cities in Mexico and the United States.

==History==
According to archaeological findings, the area of Torreón was populated around the 10th millennium BC.

The first Spanish mission arrived in 1566, led by Fr. Pedro Espinareda. However, the city developed only in the independent Mexican era, around a &quot;Torreón&quot; (&quot;Big Tower&quot;) built to monitor Río Nazas&#x27;s floods, in conjunction with the creation of a railroad connecting to the US border city of El Paso, which gave an economic boom to the city and therefore a population boom as well. The population grew from 200 in 1892 to 34,000 in 1910. Torreón received city status in 1907.

During the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), the city was taken more than once; the most prominent character ever to take the city was the revolutionary general Pancho Villa. It was also the location of the 1911 Torreón massacre, where 303 Chinese immigrants were killed by the revolutionaries over a ten-hour period. During the revolution, Torreón was also the site of an important convention that led to a deal between the rebellious armies. The city is southwest of historic San Pedro de las Colonias, where some of the Mexican Revolution battles occurred.

After the Mexican Revolution, the city continued to develop economically; during the first years of the 20th century, the primary industry of the city was farming, although other industries later formed or were established in the area.

On September 15, 2007, Torreón celebrated its first 100 years as a chartered city. It held a series of cultural events from September 15, 2006, to September 15, 2007, culminating on the day that the city turned 100 years old.

== Geography ==

Torreón is near the southwest border of the state of Coahuila, within the Laguna region of the state. The border is delineated by the Nazas River that separates it from Gómez Palacio, Durango. The municipality covers , including much of the rural area south of the city. The city&#x27;s elevation is , which is low for the Mexican interior. The terrain where the urban area is spread is generally flat, with somewhat prominent relief formations (up to south and southwest of the city, thus visible at well-nigh any given point in the city. Higher mountains, over , are on the southern, mostly uninhabited section of the Municipality, the most prominent being El Picacho.
===Climate===
The city features a desert climate (in the Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). Rainfall is scarce but more prominent in the summer, whilst temperatures are very hot by day and cool at night, although the urban heat island effect causes temperatures on summer nights to be considerably warmer than nearby areas. Flora and fauna are those common to semidesert habitats.


== Main sights ==

&quot;Cristo de las Noas&quot;, at , is the third tallest statue of Christ in Latin America, only smaller than the statue of &quot;Christ The Redeemer&quot; in Brazil and &quot;Cristo de la Concordia&quot; in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Situated on the top of a hill, this image of Jesus with extended arms symbolises protection for the inhabitants of Torreon. The hilltop has a Catholic church and offers a view of the entire city.

There are also several shopping centers in the city, including Galerias Laguna, Plaza Cuatro Caminos, and Intermall.

The &quot;Canal de la Perla&quot; (the Pearl Watercourse), an underground watercourse built in the 19th century to drive the Nazas&#x27; river water to the fields near the city, was re-discovered in 2003 and re-opened in 2014. It now passes under the oldest part of the city and it can be visited and walked through. It is also used for cultural and artistic exhibitions.

In 2006, the &quot;Museo Arocena&quot; (Arocena Museum) that holds art collections from the pre-Hispanic times to the present, was opened; it also has a section dedicated to Mexico&#x27;s and Torreón&#x27;s history. There are also temporal expositions, conferences, book fairs, movies, and activities for children.

<text>The Rock of Cashel ( ), also known as Cashel of the Kings and St. Patrick&#x27;s Rock, is a historical site located dramatically above a plain at Cashel, County Tipperary, Ireland.

==History==

According to local legends, the Rock of Cashel originated in the Devil&#x27;s Bit, a mountain 20 miles (30 km) north of Cashel when St. Patrick banished Satan from a cave, resulting in the Rock&#x27;s landing in Cashel. According to the &quot;Tripartite Life of Saint Patrick&quot; Cashel is reputed to be the site of the conversion of the King of Munster by Saint Patrick in the 5th century.

The Rock of Cashel was the traditional seat of the kings of Munster as early as the 4th century and prior to the Norman invasion. In 977 Brian Boru was crowned there as king and made Cashel his capital. In 1101, the King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briain, donated his fortress on the Rock to the Church.
The picturesque complex has a character of its own and is one of the most remarkable collections of Celtic art and medieval architecture to be found anywhere in Europe. Few remnants of the early structures survive; the majority of buildings on the current site date from the 12th and 13th centuries.

==Buildings on the Rock==

===Cormac&#x27;s Chapel===
Cormac&#x27;s Chapel, the chapel of King Cormac Mac Carthaigh, was begun in 1127 and consecrated in 1134. It is a sophisticated structure, with vaulted ceilings and wide arches, drawing on contemporary European architecture and infusing unique native elements. The Irish Abbot of Regensburg, Dirmicius of Regensburg, sent two of his carpenters to help in the work and the twin towers on either side of the junction of the nave and are strongly suggestive of their Germanic influence, as this feature is otherwise unknown in Ireland. Other notable features of the building include interior and exterior arcading, a barrel-vaulted roof, a carved tympanum over both doorways, the magnificent north doorway, ogive arched chancel and the oldest stairs in Ireland. It contains the only surviving Romanesque frescoes in Ireland. The chapel was constructed primarily of sandstone which has become waterlogged over the centuries, significantly damaging the interior frescoes. Restoration and preservation required the chapel be completely enclosed in a rain-proof structure with interior dehumidifiers to dry out the stone. It is now open for limited tours to the public.

===Cathedral===
The cathedral, built between 1235 and 1270, is an aisleless building of cruciform plan, having a central tower and terminating westwards in a massive residential castle. The Hall of the Vicars Choral was built in the 15th century. The vicars choral were laymen (sometimes minor canons) appointed to assist in chanting the cathedral services. At Cashel, there were originally eight vicars choral with their own seal. This was later reduced to five honorary vicars choral who appointed singing-men as their deputies, a practice which continued until 1836. The restoration of the Hall was undertaken by the Office of Public Works as a project in connection with the European Architectural Heritage Year, 1975. Through it visitors now enter the site.

In 1647, during the Irish Confederate Wars, Cashel was sacked by English Parliamentarian troops under Murrough O&#x27;Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin. The Irish Confederate troops there were massacred, as were the Catholic clergy, including Theobald Stapleton. Inchiquin&#x27;s troops looted or destroyed many important religious artefacts.

Sometime during or after the mid-1730s, the main cathedral roof was destroyed by Arthur Price, the Anglican Archbishop of Cashel. Today, what remains of the Rock of Cashel has become a tourist attraction. Price&#x27;s decision to remove the roof on what had been called the jewel among Irish church buildings was criticised before and since.

Queen Elizabeth II visited the Rock of Cashel during her 2011 visit to Ireland.

===The Round Tower===

The oldest and tallest of the structure is the well preserved round tower high, dating from c.1100. Its entrance is from the ground, necessitated by a shallow foundation (about 1 metre (3 feet) typical of round towers. The tower was built using the dry stone method. Modern conservationists have filled in some of the tower with mortar for safety reasons. 

==Other features==
The entire plateau on which the buildings and graveyard lie is walled. In the grounds around the buildings an extensive graveyard includes a number of high crosses. Scully&#x27;s Cross, one of the largest and most famous high crosses here, originally constructed in 1860 to commemorate the Scully family, was destroyed in 1976 when lightning struck a metal rod that ran the length of the cross. The remains of the top of the cross now lie at the base of the cross adjacent to the rock wall.

<doc id="195865" wikidata="Q223525" url="?curid=195865" title="Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)">
<text>The Symphony No. 3 in D minor by Gustav Mahler was written in sketch beginning in 1893, composed primarily in 1895, and took final form in 1896. Consisting of six movements, it is Mahler&#x27;s longest composition and is the longest symphony in the standard repertoire, with a typical performance lasting around 95 to 110 minutes. It was voted one of the ten greatest symphonies of all time in a survey of conductors carried out by the &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot;.

== Structure ==
In its final form, the work has six movements, grouped into two parts:

The first movement alone, with a normal duration of a little more than thirty minutes, sometimes forty, forms Part One of the symphony. Part Two consists of the other five movements and has a duration of about sixty to seventy minutes.

As with each of his first four symphonies, Mahler originally provided a programme of sorts to explain the narrative of the piece. He did not reveal the structure and content to the public. But, at different times, he shared evolving versions of a program for the third symphony with various friends: Max Marschalk, a music critic; violist Natalie Bauer-Lechner, a close friend and confidante; and Anna von Mildenburg, the dramatic soprano and Mahler&#x27;s lover during the summer of 1896 when he was completing the symphony. Bauer-Lechner wrote in her private journal that Mahler said, &quot;You can&#x27;t imagine how it will sound!&quot;

In its simplest form, the program consists of a title for each of the six movements:

Mahler, however, elaborated on this basic scheme in various letters. In an 1896 letter to Max Marschalk, he called the whole &quot;A Summer&#x27;s Midday Dream&quot;, and within Part One, distinguished two sections, &quot;Introduction: Pan awakes&quot; and &quot;I. Summer marches in (Bacchic procession)&quot;. In a June 1896 letter to Anna von Mildenburg, Mahler reaffirmed that he conceived the first movement in two sections: I. What the stony mountains tell me; II. Summer marches in. In another letter to Mildenburg from Summer 1896, he said that &quot;Pan&quot; seemed to him the best overall title () for the symphony, emphasizing that he was intrigued by Pan&#x27;s two meanings, a Greek god and a Greek word meaning &quot;all&quot;.

All these titles were dropped before publication in 1898.

Mahler originally envisioned a seventh movement, &quot;Heavenly Life&quot; (alternatively, &quot;What the Child Tells Me&quot;), but he eventually dropped this, using it instead as the last movement of the Symphony No. 4. Indeed, several musical motifs taken from &quot;Heavenly Life&quot; appear in the fifth (choral) movement of the Third Symphony.

The symphony, particularly due to the extensive number of movements and their marked differences in character and construction, is a unique work. The opening movement, colossal in its conception (much like the symphony itself), roughly takes the shape of sonata form, insofar as there is an alternating presentation of two theme groups; however, the themes are varied and developed with each presentation, and the typical harmonic logic of the sonata form movement—particularly the tonic statement of second theme group material in the recapitulation—is changed. The symphony starts with a &quot;fortissimo&quot; theme, stated by an 8-French horn choir. It is similar to the opening of the fourth movement of Brahms&#x27; first symphony with the same rhythm, but many of the notes are changed.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;french horn&quot; \clef treble \key d \minor \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 4*1 a4\ff-&gt; | d2-&gt; c4-&gt; d-&gt; | bes2-&gt; f8 r bes4-&gt; | d-&gt; e8-&gt; f-&gt; e4-&gt; d-&gt; | c2-&gt; a4 } &lt;/score&gt;

The opening gathers itself slowly into a rousing orchestral march. A solo tenor trombone passage states a bold (secondary) melody that is developed and transformed in its recurrences.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef bass \key d \minor \time 3/2 a1-&gt;\ff r2 | a1-&gt; r2 | \numericTimeSignature \time 2/2 \times 2/3 { r4_&quot;sempre&quot; e-&gt;\ff f-&gt; } \times 2/3 { g-&gt; f-&gt; e-&gt; } | bes&#x27;2-&gt;( a)~ | a } &lt;/score&gt;
At the apparent conclusion of the development, several solo snare drums &quot;offstage&quot; play a rhythmic passage lasting about thirty seconds and the opening passage by eight horns is repeated almost exactly.

As described above, Mahler dedicated the second movement to &quot;the flowers on the meadow&quot;. In contrast to the violent forces of the first movement, it starts as a graceful menuet, but also features stormier episodes.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;oboe&quot; \clef treble \key a \major \time 3/4 \tempo &quot;Tempo di Menuetto&quot; \partial 4*1 e4-&gt;(\pp | a8_&quot;zart&quot; r a) r | b4-&gt;( | gis8 r gis) r a8.( b16 | gis8-.[ r16 fis-. e8-. r16 d-. cis8. fis16] | e8 r e) r } &lt;/score&gt;

The third movement, a scherzo, with alternating sections in and meter, quotes extensively from Mahler&#x27;s early song &quot;Ablösung im Sommer&quot; (Relief in Summer).
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \clef treble \key c \minor \time 2/4 g8-.\f g-. f(\trill g16 f | ees8-.) ees-. d4 | \slashedGrace { f8(} ees-.) ees-. d4-- | c8.( d16 f ees d-. c-.) | g&#x27;( aes g aes g4) | f16( g f g f4) | ees16( f ees f ees4) } &lt;/score&gt;
In the trio section, the mood change from playful to contemplative occurs with an off-stage post horn (or flugelhorn) solo.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key f \major \time 6/8 c4 c,8 f[ r16 c-. f8-.] | c&#x27;4.~ c4 \breathe c,8 | f4 f8 a[ r16 f-. a8-.] | c4.~c4 \breathe } &lt;/score&gt;
This posthorn episode closely resembles standardised posthorn signals in Austria and Prussia of the time. The posthorn melody is suddenly interrupted (in measure 345) by a trumpet fanfare representing a literal quotation of the Austrian military signal for falling out (&quot;Abblasen&quot;). Another important quotation in the movement is a Spanish folk melody of &quot;jota aragonesa&quot; used by Mikhail Glinka in &quot;Caprice brillante&quot; and by Franz Liszt in &quot;Rhapsodie espagnole&quot;. Most probably it borrowed here from Ferruccio Busoni&#x27;s transcription of the Rhapsodie for piano and orchestra, as the harmonies are almost identical and passages are equally almost similar. Busoni himself was the first to remark on this quotation in 1910.

The reprise of the scherzo music is unusual, as it is interrupted several times by the post-horn melody.

At this point, in the sparsely instrumentated fourth movement, we hear an alto solo singing a setting of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Song&quot; (&quot;Zarathustra&#x27;s roundelay&quot;) from &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; (&quot;O Mensch! Gib acht!&quot; (&quot;O man! Take heed!&quot;)), with thematic material from the first movement woven into it. The movement is punctuated by oboe glissandi, representing the cry of a night bird.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; { \new ChoralStaff « \new Staff \relative c&quot; { \clef treble \key d \major \numericTimeSignature \time 2/2 \partial 2*1 a2 | a1 | \time 3/2 r2 r a | \time 2/2 a1 } \addlyrics { O Mensch!

The cheerful fifth movement, &quot;Es sungen drei Engel&quot;, is one of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; songs, (whose text itself is loosely based on a 17th-century church hymn, which Paul Hindemith later used in its original form in his ) about the redemption of sins and comfort in belief.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key f \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \autoBeamOff \partial 8*1 c8 | c&#x27;4 c8 bes a8. bes16 a8 g | f4 d8 d c4 r8 } \addlyrics { Es sun- gen drei En- gel ei- nen Sü- ßen Ge- sang; } &lt;/score&gt;
Here, a children&#x27;s choir imitating bells and a female chorus join the alto solo.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; { \new ChoralStaff « \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key f \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 f1 | f1 } \addlyrics { Bimm bamm } \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \key f \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 f2 g | f d } \addlyrics { Bimm bamm bimm bamm } » } &lt;/score&gt;

Of the finale, Bruno Walter wrote,
In the last movement, words are stilled—for what language can utter heavenly love more powerfully and forcefully than music itself? The Adagio, with its broad, solemn melodic line, is, as a whole—and despite passages of burning pain—eloquent of comfort and grace. It is a single sound of heartfelt and exalted feelings, in which the whole giant structure finds its culmination.
The movement begins very softly with a broad D-major chorale melody in the strings, which slowly builds to a loud and majestic conclusion culminating on repeated D major chords with bold statements on the timpani.

The last movement in particular had a triumphant critical success. The Swiss critic William Ritter, in his review of the premiere given in 1902, said of the last movement: &quot;Perhaps the greatest Adagio written since Beethoven&quot;. Another anonymous critic writing in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung wrote about the Adagio: &quot;It rises to heights which situate this movement among the most sublime in all symphonic literature&quot;. Mahler was called back to the podium 12 times, and the local newspaper reported that &quot;the thunderous ovation lasted no less than fifteen minutes&quot;.

== Text ==

=== Fourth movement ===
Text from Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;: the &quot;Midnight Song&quot;

&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;O Mensch! Gib Acht!
Was spricht die tiefe Mitternacht?
&quot;Ich schlief, ich schlief —,
aus tiefem Traum bin ich erwacht: —
Die Welt ist tief,
und tiefer als der Tag gedacht.
Tief ist ihr Weh —,
Lust — tiefer noch als Herzeleid.
Weh spricht: Vergeh!
Doch all&#x27; Lust will Ewigkeit —,
— will tiefe, tiefe Ewigkeit!&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;O Man! Take heed!
What says the deep midnight?
&quot;I slept, I slept —,
from a deep dream have I awoken: —
the world is deep,
and deeper than the day has thought.
Deep is its pain —,
joy — deeper still than heartache.
Pain says: Pass away!
But all joy seeks eternity —,
— seeks deep, deep eternity!&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Fifth movement ===
Text from &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;

&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;Es sungen drei Engel einen süßen Gesang,
mit Freuden es selig in dem Himmel klang.
Sie jauchzten fröhlich auch dabei:
daß Petrus sei von Sünden frei!

Und als der Herr Jesus zu Tische saß,
mit seinen zwölf Jüngern das Abendmahl aß,
da sprach der Herr Jesus: &quot;Was stehst du denn hier?
Wenn ich dich anseh&#x27;, so weinest du mir!&quot;

&quot;Und sollt&#x27; ich nicht weinen, du gütiger Gott?
Ich hab&#x27; übertreten die zehn Gebot!
Ich gehe und weine ja bitterlich!
Ach komm und erbarme dich über mich!&quot;

&quot;Hast du denn übertreten die zehen Gebot,
so fall auf die Knie und bete zu Gott!
Liebe nur Gott in alle Zeit!
So wirst du erlangen die himmlische Freud&#x27;.&quot;

Die himmlische Freud&#x27; ist eine selige Stadt,
die himmlische Freud&#x27;, die kein Ende mehr hat!
Die himmlische Freude war Petro bereit&#x27;t,
durch Jesum und allen zur Seligkeit.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Three angels sang a sweet song,
with blessed joy it rang in heaven.
They shouted too for joy
that Peter was free from sin!

And as Lord Jesus sat at the table
with his twelve disciples and ate the evening meal,
Lord Jesus said: &quot;Why do you stand here?
When I look at you, you are weeping!&quot;

&quot;And should I not weep, kind God?
I have violated the ten commandments!
I wander and weep bitterly!
O come and take pity on me!&quot;

&quot;If you have violated the ten commandments,
then fall on your knees and pray to God!
Love only God for all time!
So will you gain heavenly joy.&quot;

The heavenly joy is a blessed city,
the heavenly joy that has no end!
The heavenly joy was granted to Peter
through Jesus, and to all mankind for eternal bliss.&lt;/poem&gt;

== Tonality ==
Peter Franklin in &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; represents the symphony&#x27;s progressive tonal scheme as &#x27;d/F—D&#x27;. More casually it is described as being in D minor. The first movement certainly begins in this key but, by its end, has defined the relative F major as the tonic. The finale concludes in D major, the tonic major, which is not unusual for minor key, multi-movement works. Throughout the symphony, traditional tonality is employed in an enterprising manner with clear purpose .

== Editions and performance ==

The piece is performed in concert less frequently than Mahler&#x27;s other symphonies, due in part to its great length and the huge forces required. Despite this, it is a popular work and has been recorded by most major orchestras and conductors.

When it is performed, a short interval is sometimes taken between the first movement (which alone lasts around half an hour) and the rest of the piece. This is in agreement with the manuscript copy of the full score (held in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York), where the end of the first movement carries the inscription &quot;Folgt eine lange Pause!&quot; (&quot;there follows a long pause&quot;). The inscription is not found in the score as published.

The Adagio movement was arranged by Yoon Jae Lee in 2011 for a smaller orchestra. This version was premiered by Ensemble 212 with Lee as conductor in New York on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Subsequently, Lee arranged the five remaining movements for smaller orchestra as part of his Mahler Chamber Project. The orchestral reduction of the entire symphony was premiered in October 2015 by Ensemble 212, mezzo-soprano Hyona Kim, and the Young New Yorkers&#x27; Chorus Women&#x27;s Ensemble.

The second movement was arranged by Benjamin Britten in 1941 for a smaller orchestra. This version was published by Boosey &amp; Hawkes as &quot;What the Wild Flowers Tell Me&quot; in 1950.

== In other media ==
 The final movement is also played during Coleman Silk&#x27;s funeral in Philip Roth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Human Stain&quot;.

A section from the fourth movement &quot;Midnight Song&quot; features in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (which also features the Adagietto from the Fifth Symphony), where it is presented as the music that Gustav von Aschenbach composes before he dies.

The work is also referenced in the pop singer Prince&#x27;s song &quot;Good Love&quot; (&quot;Gustav Mahler #3 is jamming on the box&quot;) from his &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; album and the &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; soundtrack.

<doc id="195874" wikidata="Q1192713" url="?curid=195874" title="Livingston, Guatemala">
<text>Livingston is a town in Izabal Department, eastern Guatemala, at the mouth of the Río Dulce at the Gulf of Honduras. The town serves as the municipal seat of the municipality of the same name. It was Guatemala&#x27;s main port on the Caribbean Sea before the construction of nearby Puerto Barrios.

Livingston is noted for its mix of Garífuna, Afro-Caribbean, Maya and Ladino people and culture. In recent decades Livingston has developed a large tourist industry.

==History==
Livingston is named after American jurist and politician Edward Livingston, who wrote the &quot;Livingston Codes&quot;, which - translated into Spanish by liberal leader José Francisco Barrundia - were used as the basis for the laws of the liberal government of the United Provinces of Central America in the early 19th century. However, this government did not come to fruition in Guatemala, because of the conservative and clerical revolution led by Rafael Carrera in 1838 that overthrew governor Mariano Gálvez and gave way to a conservative and Catholic regime that lasted until 1871.

===Franja Transversal del Norte===

In the 1960s, the importance of the region known as Franja Transversal del Norte was in livestock, exploitation of precious export wood and archaeological wealth. Timber contracts were granted to multinational companies, such as Murphy Pacific Corporation from California, which invested US$30 million for the colonization of southern Petén (department) and Alta Verapaz and formed the North Impulsadora Company. Colonization of the area was made through a process by which inhospitable areas of the Franja Transversal del Norte (FTN) were granted to native peasants.

In 1964, the National Institute for Agrarian Transformation (INTA) defined the geography of the FTN as the northern part of the departments of Huehuetenango, Quiché, Alta Verapaz and Izabal and that same year priests of the Maryknoll order and the Order of the Sacred Heart began the first process of colonization, along with INTA, carrying settlers from Huehuetenango to the Ixcán sector in Quiché.

The Northern Transversal Strip was officially created during the government of General Carlos Arana Osorio in 1970, by Decree 60-70 in the Congress, for agricultural development. The area included within the municipalities: Santa Ana Huista, San Antonio Huista, Nentón, Jacaltenango, San Mateo Ixtatán, and Santa Cruz Barillas in Huehuetenango; Chajul and San Miguel Uspantán in Quiché; Cobán, Chisec, San Pedro Carchá, Lanquín, Senahú, Cahabón and Chahal, in Alta Verapaz and the entire department of Izabal.

== Economy ==

=== African palm oil ===


There is high demand in Guatemala and some of its neighbors for edible oils and fats, which explains how the African palm oil became so popular in the country to the detriment of other oils, and which has allowed new companies associated to capitalize a new investment phase that can be found particularly in some of the territories that form the Northern Transversal Strip of Guatemala. The investors are trying to turn Guatemala into one of the main palm oil exporters, in spite of the decline of its international price. The most active region is found in Chisec and Cobán, in Alta Verapaz Department; Ixcán in Quiché Department, and Sayaxché, Petén Department, where Palmas del Ixcán, S.A. (PALIX) is located, both with its own plantation and those of subcontractors. Another active region is that of Fray Bartolomé de las Casas and Chahal in Alta Verapaz Department; El Estor and Livingston, Izabal Department; and San Luis, Petén, where Naturaceites operates.

== Transport ==
Boats run several times a day from Puerto Barrios, and twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays from Punta Gorda, Belize. Boats also run every morning from Livingston to Punta Gorda. However, due to collusion between boat owners, the fares are much higher than passage from Puerto Barrios. There is another boat that transports tourists from Livingston in through Río Dulce; it runs every day. All access is via watercraft since there is no road link to the rest of Guatemala.

As of early 2014, foreign passengers arriving in Livingston still present their passports at the customs office, which is two blocks up the hill from the dock, on the left side of the street. One is entirely free to walk right past the customs office and forego this formality; however, doing so may subject one to significant delays and possible fines when one leaves Guatemala at any land crossing, port, or airport.

== Languages ==
A number of languages are spoken in Livingston including Spanish, Garifuna language, Mayan Qʼeqchiʼ, and English.

== Notable people ==
*Guillermo Ramírez, footballer of Municipal, C.S.D. in the Guatemalan Football League
*Marvin Ávila, footballer of Shaanxi Neo-China Chanba F.C.
*Ricardo Trigueño, footballer of Deportivo Petapa in the Guatemalan Football League.

==In films==

=== &quot;The New Adventures of Tarzan&quot; (1935) ===

In 1935, the film &quot;The New Adventures of Tarzan&quot;, was filmed on location in Guatemala, taking advantage of the help from the United Fruit Company and president Jorge Ubico.

=== &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; (2019) ===
Livingston briefly appears as the setting of an early scene in the 2019 film &quot;&quot;. Sarah Connor and her teenage son John are hiding out there in 1998, following the events of the second movie.

==Climate==

Livingston has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;).

<doc id="195877" wikidata="Q693658" url="?curid=195877" title="Izabal Department">
<text>Izabal () is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. Its coastal areas form part of the homeland of the Garifuna people.

Izabal is bordered to the north by Belize, to the northeast by the Gulf of Honduras, to the east by Honduras, and by the Guatemalan departments of Petén to the northwest, Alta Verapaz to the west, and Zacapa to the south.

The Izabal Department surrounds Lake Izabal (or Lago de Izabal), which is Guatemala&#x27;s largest lake (about 48 km long and 24 km wide, with an area of about 590 km2). The Spanish Colonial fort of San Felipe, now a Guatemalan national monument, overlooks the point where the lake flows into the Río Dulce.

The small town of Izabal is on the south shore of the lake; before the construction of the ports of Livingston and Puerto Barrios in the 19th century this was Guatemala&#x27;s main Caribbean Sea port and was the original seat of Izabal department; nowadays, however, Izabal town is a remote village that gets little traffic.

From the area around Lake Izabal, the Department of Izabal stretches along the Río Dulce to the coast of the Caribbean Sea.

The department of Izabal includes the ports of Puerto Barrios (the departmental seat), Santo Tomás de Castilla, Livingston and Guatemala&#x27;s free trade zone Zolic. Izabal also includes the Pre-Columbian Maya ruins of Quirigua.

<text>Puerto Barrios () is a city in Guatemala, located within the Gulf of Honduras. The city is located on Bahia de Amatique. Puerto Barrios is the departmental seat of Izabal department and is the administrative seat of Puerto Barrios municipality.

It is Guatemala&#x27;s main Caribbean Sea port, together with its more modern twin port town just to the southwest, Santo Tomás de Castilla. As of the 2018 census, the population of Puerto Barrios was 100,593. Puerto Barrios is located northeast of Guatemala City. It is the terminus of Highway CA9 which begins at the Pacific port city of Puerto San José and traverses the country through Guatemala City.

The city&#x27;s population is a mix of mostly Garifuna, Maya, (such as Afro-Jamaicans), and other West Indian groups. Its heyday was in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries, following the construction of a railroad connecting large banana and coffee plantations with the shipping docks, all controlled by the International Railways of Central America and The Great White Fleet, both owned by the United Fruit Company.

Puerto Barrios is divided into many neighborhoods or Barrios such as El Rastro, Las Champas, Los Tanques, La Veinte, La Veintedos, La Catorce, La Trece, and El Estrecho. Although the town is small, due to its harbor nature, many of its visitors are ship workers who frequent the night entertainment centers throughout the town.

Puerto Barrios is starting to get more visitors in the new century as the nearby town of Santo Tomás de Castilla has started receiving cruise ships. Puerto Barrios Airport was refurbished and receives scheduled flights.

Among the many nearby tourist attractions are the Mayan ruins of Quirigua. In 1910, the United Fruit Company bought Quiriguá and all the land around the site for banana production; they set aside around the ceremonial center as an archaeological park, leaving an island of jungle among the plantations. Nearby the Quirigua ruins is the Quirigua Hospital, established by United Fruit Company in 1910, and considered the finest tropical hospital in the America&#x27;s at the time of its operation. On the grounds of the hospital is the Quirigua Hospital Cemetery, where some of the UFC and hospital workers that died in Guatemala are interred. The Castillo de San Felipe de Lara, an old Spanish fort in Río Dulce, guards the entrance to Lake Izabal. Another popular attraction is the lively town of Livingston where Garifuna culture can be experienced, with its Punta and Yankunu dances.

==History==


In 1883, then president general Justo Rufino Barrios had the plan to connect Guatemala City to a port on the Atlantic shore through a railroad in order to be able to move the coffee produced by his own haciendas and those of his liberal partners. On 4 August 1883, he issued a decree in which a person with a salary of more than 4 pesos a month could pay 4 pesos a year over a 10-year span to finance the railroad. However, after the death of Barrios in the Battle of Chalchuapa in 1885, this plan was forgotten by his successor, general Manuel Lisandro Barillas.

It was not until 1892, when José María Reina Barrios assumed power, that the railroad project was restarted. On 19 July 1895, Reina Barrios issued executive action No. 513, which established that a city was to be founded between the Escondido and Estrecho rivers, to be called Puerto Barrios. The ceremonial act of foundation took place on 5 December 1892. A part of the Northern Railroad project, executive action No. 524 declared Puerto Barrios to be a &quot;Major port of the Republic&quot; and ordered the customs offices previously based in Livingston to be relocated there.

The Exposición Centroamericana (Central American Expo) was an industrial and cultural exposition that was to take place in Guatemala in 1897 and which was approved on 8 March 1894 by the National Assembly by Decree 253 by a suggestion made by president Reina Barrios. Given that in those days most visitors arriving from Europe and North America would arrive at the port on the Caribbean Sea shore, Reina Barrios pushed for the Northern Railroad to be finished quickly. Not only was the railroad vital for the Expo success, it was key to move merchandise and passengers between the Caribbean Sea and the new Port of Iztapa on the Pacific shore. Reina Barrios hoped the railroad would improve the progress and development of the country given that the United States and Spain were still at war over Cuba, and it was evident that a dependable inter-oceanic communication line was crucial for the North American country. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of Reina Barrios&#x27; government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the Panama Canal was not built yet. However, a sharp decline in the price of coffee and silver, along with the high technical difficulties of the railroad construction close to Guatemala City – mainly due to the steep cliffs and mountains around the city− resulted in the collapse of Guatemala&#x27;s economy, and the eventual assassination of Reina Barrios, on 8 February 1898.

After Reina Barrios&#x27; death, civilian lawyer Manuel Estrada Cabrera was designated as president and inherited an enormous external debt to British banks, which forced him to search for an ally in the United States. In 1900, Estrada Cabrera authorized his Secretary of Economy, Rafael Spínola, to contract an American company, Central American Improvement Co. Inc., to finish the Northern Railroad and fix those stretches that were in disrepair on the rest of the line. To cover the expenses, the Guatemalan government gave a concession to the American company to use the railroad along with all of its facilities without any cost; this included the port and dock in Puerto Barrios, for which the Guatemalan people and government had to pay fees for their use.

Finally, in 1904, knowing the pro-American attitude of Estrada Cabrera, Minor Keith&#x27;s partners, began to get concession on railroads of both Guatemala and El Salvador, and in that year, International Railways of Central American (IRCA) was incorporated in New Jersey.; the harbor was then partly built by Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Corps of Engineers in 1906-1908. Eventually, United Fruit Company, owner of IRCA, controlled Puerto Barrios completely, as it owned the docks, the railroads, the banana production from Izabal and even the merchant fleet: the Great White Fleet.

This situation remained as such until the government of Colonel Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán (1951-1954), who decided to build a highway and another port – Santo Tomas de Castilla – to compete with the American fruit company. He also issued an Agrarian Reform that impacted UFCO land. Eventually, Árbenz was accused of Communism and was ousted in 1954, but the highway was almost completed and was completed by his successor, colonel Carlos Castillo Armas. Just as Arbenz had hoped, IRCA&#x27;s last profit was reported in 1957.

The earthquake on 4 February 1976, one of the worst in Guatemala&#x27;s history, destroyed most of the port facilities of Puerto Barrios, and most modern cargo traffic moved to its twin port in Santo Tomás de Castilla. In the 21st century, Puerto Barrios remains an important hub for Dole and Fresh Del Monte Produce industries in addition to Chiquita, United Fruit Company&#x27;s successor.

==Geographic location==
The municipality&#x27;s elevation varies from sea level at Punta de Manabique to above sea level at Cerro San Gil. The municipal capital is located on the shore of Santo Tomás internal bay, which is part of Amatique Bay. There is a small peninsula called Punta de Manabique which separates the small bay from the Gulf of Honduras, and shelters it from storms.

==Climate==
Puerto Barrios has a trade-wind tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;). The city experiences significant rainfall year-round. Like most cities and towns with this climate, Puerto Barrios does not have a dry season. The average annual temperature in Puerto Barrios is . About of rain falls annually over the course of the year.

==Transport==
===Construction of Atlantic Highway and Santo Tomas de Castilla Harbor===
In order to establish the necessary physical infrastructure to make possible the &quot;independent&quot; and national capitalist development that could reduce the extreme dependence on the United States and break the American monopolies operating in the country, president Jacobo Árbenz and his government began the planning and construction of the Atlantic Highway, which was intended to compete with the monopoly on land transport exerted by the United Fruit Company, through one of its subsidiaries: the International Railways of Central America (IRCA), which had the concession since 1904, when it was granted by then president Manuel Estrada Cabrera. Construction of the highway began by the Roads Department of the Ministry of Communications, with the help of the military engineering battalion. It was planned to be built parallel along the railway line, as much as possible. The construction of the new port was also aimed to break another UFCO monopoly, since Puerto Barrios was owned and operated solely by The Great White Fleet, another UFCO subsidiary.

==In films==

===&quot;The New Adventures of Tarzan&quot;&#x27; (1935)===

In 1935, the film &quot;The New Adventures of Tarzan&quot;, was filmed on location in Guatemala, taking advantage of the help from the United Fruit Company and president Jorge Ubico. The places where the filming was made were:

* Chichicastenango: scenes of a native town where the explorers first met.
* Antigua Guatemala: The Green Goddess temple
* Río Dulce
* Puerto Barrios: arrival and departure of the boats carrying the explorers
* Tikal: jungle scenes
* Quiriguá: Mayan city where they get lectured on the maya civilization
* Guatemala City: then luxurious Palace Hotel was used to shoot the scenes of the hotel in the imaginary town of At Mantique
==Government and infrastructure==
There is a prison in the city with an official capacity of 175 prisoners. As of 2016, it has over 900 prisoners, making it over capacity.

==Torre Manatí==
In 2018, Desarrollos Inmobiliarios Izabal, S.A. a development company in Guatemala commissioned Guatemalan architecture firm, Studio Domus, to develop a 15 million dollar development project consisting of a 37-story skyscraper and yacht club in Puerto Barrios. Developers broke ground in May 2019 and construction is expected to conclude in January 2021.

When completed, Torre Manatí will be the tallest skyscraper in Central America.

<doc id="195881" wikidata="Q106956710" url="?curid=195881" title="Miracle of Chile">
<text>The &quot;Miracle of Chile&quot; was a term used by economist Milton Friedman to describe the reorientation of the Chilean economy in the 1980s and the effects of the economic policies applied by a large group of Chilean economists who collectively came to be known as the Chicago Boys, having studied at the University of Chicago where Friedman taught. He said the &quot;Chilean economy did very well, but more importantly, in the end the central government, the military junta, was replaced by a democratic society. So the really important thing about the Chilean business is that free markets did work their way in bringing about a free society.&quot; The junta to which Friedman refers was a military government that came to power in a 1973 coup d&#x27;état, which came to an end in 1990 after a democratic 1988 plebiscite removed Augusto Pinochet from the presidency.

The economic reforms implemented by the Chicago Boys had three main objectives: economic liberalization, privatization of state-owned companies, and stabilization of inflation. The first reforms were implemented in three rounds – 1974–1983, 1985, and 1990. The reforms were continued and strengthened after 1990 by the post-Pinochet center government of Patricio Aylwin&#x27;s Christian Democrats. However, the center-left government of Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle also made a commitment to poverty reduction. In 1988, 48% of Chileans lived below the poverty line. By 2000 this had been reduced to 20%. A 2004 World Bank report attributed 60% of Chile&#x27;s 1990&#x27;s poverty reduction to economic growth, and claimed that government programs aimed at poverty alleviation accounted for the rest.

Hernán Büchi, Minister of Finance under Pinochet between 1985 and 1989, wrote a book detailing the implementation process of the economic reforms during his tenure. Successive governments have continued these policies. In 2002 Chile signed an association agreement with the European Union (comprising free trade and political and cultural agreements), in 2003, an extensive free trade agreement with the United States, and in 2004 with South Korea, expecting a boom in import and export of local produce and becoming a regional trade-hub. Continuing the coalition&#x27;s free-trade strategy, in August 2006, President Bachelet promulgated a free trade agreement with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (signed under the previous administration of Ricardo Lagos), the first Chinese free-trade agreement with a Latin American nation; similar deals with Japan and India were promulgated in August 2007. In 2010, Chile was the first nation in South America to win membership in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, an organization restricted to the world&#x27;s richest countries.

Some economists (such as Nobel laureate Amartya Sen) have argued that the experience of Chile in this period indicates a &quot;failure&quot; of the economic liberalism posited by thinkers such as Friedman, claiming that there was little net economic growth from 1975 to 1982 (during the so-called &quot;pure Monetarist experiment&quot;). After the catastrophic banking crisis of 1982, the state controlled more of the economy than it had under the previous socialist government, and sustained economic growth only came after the later reforms that privatized the economy, while social indicators remained poor. Pinochet&#x27;s dictatorship made the unpopular economic reorientation possible by repressing opposition to it. This repression included assassinations organized under Operation Condor, mass systematized torture, exile, and the international hunting of dissidents. In all, there were 40,018 victims documented, including 3,065 killed. Rather than a triumph of the free market, the OECD economist Javier Santiso described this reorientation as &quot;combining neo-liberal sutures and interventionist cures&quot;.

In 1972, Chile&#x27;s inflation was at 150%. According to Hernán Büchi, several factors such as expropriations, price controls, and protectionism caused these economic problems. At the same time, the United States conducted a campaign to deepen the inflation crisis. The Central Bank increased the money supply to pay for the increasing deficit. Büchi states that this increase was the primary cause for inflation.

United States government documents report an antagonistic foreign economic policy toward the Allende government that was &quot;articulated at the highest levels&quot; during this time. Shortly after Salvador Allende was elected president, but before he assumed office, then-CIA-director Richard Helms met with President Richard Nixon and discussed the situation in Chile. Helms&#x27; notes from his September 15, 1970 meeting contain the indication: &quot;Make the economy scream.&quot; A week later Ambassador Edward Korry reported telling outgoing Chilean president Eduardo Frei Montalva, through his Defense Minister, that &quot;not a nut or bolt would be allowed to reach Chile under Allende.&quot; By late 1972, the Chilean Ministry of the Economy estimated that almost one-third of the diesel trucks at Chuquicamata Copper Mine, 30 percent of the privately owned city buses, 21 percent of all taxis, and 33 percent of state-owned buses in Chile could not operate because of the lack of spare parts or tires. In overall terms, the value of United States machinery and transport equipment exported to Chile by U.S. firms declined from $153 million in 1970 to $110 million in 1971.

Immediately following the Chilean coup of 1973, Augusto Pinochet was made aware of a confidential economic plan known as &quot;El ladrillo&quot; (literally, &quot;the brick&quot;), so called because the report was &quot;as thick as a brick&quot;. The plan had been quietly prepared in May 1973 by economists who opposed Salvador Allende&#x27;s government, with the help from a group of economists the press were calling the Chicago Boys, because they were predominantly alumni of the University of Chicago. The document contained the backbone of what would later on become the Chilean economic policy. According to the 1975 report of a United States Senate Intelligence Committee investigation, the Chilean economic plan was prepared in collaboration with the CIA.

The plan recommended a set of economic reforms that included deregulation and privatization. Among other reforms, they made the central bank independent, cut tariffs, privatized the state-controlled pension system, state industries, and banks, and reduced taxes. Pinochet&#x27;s stated aim was to &quot;make Chile not a nation of proletarians, but a nation of entrepreneurs&quot;.

==Reforms==
The first reforms were implemented in three rounds: 1974–1983, 1985, and 1990.

The government welcomed foreign investment and eliminated protectionist trade barriers, forcing Chilean businesses to compete with imports on an equal footing, or else go out of business. The main copper company, Codelco, remained in government hands due to the nationalization of copper completed by Salvador Allende, however, private companies were allowed to explore and develop new mines.

Minister of Finance Sergio de Castro, departing from Friedman&#x27;s support for free floating exchange rates, decided on a pegged exchange rate of 39 pesos per dollar in June 1979, under the rationale of bringing Chile&#x27;s rampant inflation to heel. The result, however, was that a serious balance-of-trade problem arose, leading Milton Friedman to criticize De Castro and the fixed exchange rate in his Memoirs (&quot;Chapter 24: Chile&quot;, 1998). Since Chilean peso inflation continued to outpace U.S. dollar inflation, every year Chilean buying power of foreign goods increased. When the bubble finally burst in late 1982, Chile slid into a severe recession that lasted more than two years.

This deep economic recession of 1982–1983 was Chile&#x27;s second in eight years. (In 1975, when GDP fell by 13 percent, industrial production plunged by 27 percent and unemployment increased to 20 percent). Additionally, inflation reached 375 percent in 1974—the highest rate in the world and almost twice the top level under Allende. During the 1982–1983 recession, real economic output declined by 19%, with most of the recovery and subsequent growth taking place after Pinochet left office, when market-oriented economic policies were additionally strengthened.

Starting in 1985, with Hernán Büchi as Minister of Finance, the focus of economic policies shifted toward financial solvency and economic growth. Exports grew rapidly and unemployment went down, however, poverty still represented a significant problem, with 45 percent of Chile&#x27;s population below the poverty line in 1987. Büchi wrote about his experience during this period in his book &quot;La transformación económica de Chile: el modelo del progreso&quot;. In 1990, the newly elected Patricio Aylwin government undertook a program of &quot;growth with equity&quot;, emphasizing both continued economic liberalization and poverty reduction. Between 1990 and 2000, poverty was reduced from 40 percent of the population to 20 percent. 60 percent of this reduction can be attributed to GDP growth, with the remaining 40 percent attributable social policies.

===Free trade agreements===
Successive Chilean governments have actively pursued trade-liberalizing agreements. The process began in the 1970s, when Pinochet cut tariffs on imports to 10%. Prior to that, Chile had been one of the most protectionist economies in the world, ranking 71 out of 72 in a 1975 Cato Institute and Fraser Institute annual report. During the 1990s, Chile signed free trade agreements (FTA) with Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Chile also concluded preferential trade agreements with Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. An association agreement with Mercosur—Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay—went into effect in October 1996. Continuing its export-oriented development strategy, Chile completed landmark free trade agreements in 2002 with the European Union and South Korea. Chile, as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization, is seeking to boost commercial ties to Asian markets. To that end, it has signed trade agreements in recent years with New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, India, China, and most recently Japan. In 2007, Chile held trade negotiations with Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, and China. In 2008, Chile hopes to conclude an FTA with Australia, and finalize an expanded agreement (covering trade in services and investment) with China. The P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to expand ties through adding a finance and investment chapter to the existing P4 agreement. Chile&#x27;s trade talks with Malaysia and Thailand are also scheduled to continue in 2008.

== Performance on economic and social indicators ==

Amartya Sen, in his book &quot;Hunger and Public Action&quot;, examines the performance of Chile in various economic and social indicators. He finds, from a survey of the literature on the field:

Wages decreased by 8%. Family allowances in 1989 were 28% of what they had been in 1970 and the budgets for education, health and housing had dropped by over 20% on average.

Nobel laureate and economist Gary Becker states that &quot;Chile&#x27;s annual growth in per capita real income from 1985 to 1996 averaged a remarkable 5 percent, far above the rest of Latin America.&quot; Since then the economy has averaged 3% annual growth in GDP. Becker also said, in 1997, that Chile had become &quot;an economic role model for the whole underdeveloped world&quot;. Margaret Thatcher declared that Pinochet&#x27;s regime had turned Chile &quot;from chaotic collectivism into the model economy of Latin America&quot; whereas George H. W. Bush asserted that &quot;Chile&#x27;s record of economic accomplishment is a lesson for Latin America on the power of the free market. Nowhere among the nations of this continent has the pace of free‐​market reform gone farther, faster than right here in Chile&quot;.

Developments were very positive with regards to infant mortality and life expectancy—infant mortality rate fell so much that Chile achieved the lowest level of infant mortality in Latin America in the 1980s. Infant mortality rate in Chile fell from 76.1 per 1000 to 22.6 per 1000 from 1970 to 1985. In 1988, the military government passed a law making all abortion illegal. As of July 19, 2017, legislation permitting abortion under limited circumstances (if the pregnancy endangers the life of the woman, if the fetus is not viable, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape) was passed.

However, Sen claims that this improvement was not because of &quot;free-market&quot; policies but because of active public and state intervention. Chile had a very long tradition of public action for the improvement of childcare, which were largely maintained after the Pinochet coup:

Nevertheless, according to libertarian writer Axel Kaiser:

Performance on economic indicators in comparison to those of other Chilean presidencies: 
==Milton Friedman==
Milton Friedman gave some lectures advocating free market economic policies at the Universidad Católica de Chile. In 1975, two years after the coup, he met with Pinochet for 45 minutes, where the general &quot;indicated very little indeed about his own or the government&#x27;s feeling&quot; and the president asked Friedman to write him a letter laying out what he thought Chile&#x27;s economic policies should be, which he also did. To stop inflation, Friedman proposed reduction of government deficits that had increased in the past years and a flat commitment by government that after six months it will no longer finance government spending by creating money. He proposed relief of cases of real hardship among poorest classes. In October 1975 the New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis declared that &quot;the Chilean junta&#x27;s economic policy is based on the ideas of Milton Friedman…and his Chicago School&quot;.

Friedman has wondered why some have attacked him for giving a lecture in Chile: &quot;I must say, it&#x27;s such a wonderful example of a double standard, because I had spent time in Yugoslavia, which was a communist country. I later gave a series of lectures in China. When I came back from communist China, I wrote a letter to the Stanford Daily newspaper in which I said, &#x27;It&#x27;s curious. I gave exactly the same lectures in China that I gave in Chile. I have had many demonstrations against me for what I said in Chile. Nobody has made any objections to what I said in China. How come?&#x27;&quot; He noted that his visit was unrelated to the political side of the regime and that, during his visit to Chile, he even stated that following his economic liberalization advice would help bring political freedom and the downfall of the regime.

== Democracy ==
Commenting on his statement about the &quot;Miracle&quot;, Friedman says that &quot;the emphasis of that talk was that free markets would undermine political centralization and political control.&quot; Friedman stated that &quot;The real miracle in Chile was not that those economic reforms worked so well, but because that&#x27;s what Adam Smith said they would do. Chile is by all odds the best economic success story in Latin America today. The real miracle is that a military junta was willing to let them do it.&quot; Friedman said the &quot;Chilean economy did very well, but more important, in the end the central government, the military junta, was replaced by a democratic society. So the really important thing about the Chilean business is that free markets did work their way in bringing about a free society.&quot;

==Current Chilean economy==
According to the 2015 Index of Economic Freedom (of the Heritage Foundation, Fraser Institute and WSJ), Chile&#x27;s economy is the 7th freest. Chile is ranked 1st out of 29 countries in the Americas and has been a regional leader for over a decade. Chile&#x27;s annual GDP growth was 3.2% in 2008 and had averaged 4.8% from 2004 to 2008.

The percent of total income earned by the richest 20% of the Chilean population in 2020 was 51.6%, while the percent of total income earned by the poorest 20% of the Chilean population was 5.5%, with the middle 60% of the population earning 42.9% of total income. Chile&#x27;s Gini index (measure of income distribution) was 44.9 in 2020, compared to 24.7 of Denmark (most equally distributed) and 74.3 of Namibia (most unequally distributed). Chile&#x27;s inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient has generally been decreasing since 1990.

<doc id="195883" wikidata="Q942268" url="?curid=195883" title="Foo fighter">
<text>The term foo fighters was used by Allied aircraft pilots during World War II to describe various unidentified flying objects or mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over both the European and Pacific theaters of operations.

Though &quot;foo fighters&quot; initially described a type of UFO reported and named by the U.S. 415th Night Fighter Squadron, the term was also commonly used to mean any UFO sighting from that period. Formally reported from November 1944 onwards, foo fighters were presumed by witnesses to be secret weapons employed by the enemy.

The Robertson Panel explored possible explanations, for instance that they were electrostatic phenomena similar to St. Elmo&#x27;s fire, electromagnetic phenomena, or simply reflections of light from ice crystals.

== Etymology ==

The nonsense word &quot;foo&quot; emerged in popular culture during the early 1930s, first being used by cartoonist Bill Holman, who peppered his &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; fireman cartoon strips with &quot;foo&quot; signs and puns.

The term &quot;foo&quot; was borrowed from &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; by a radar operator in the 415th Night Fighter Squadron, Donald J. Meiers, who, according to most 415th members, gave the foo fighters their name. Meiers was from Chicago and was an avid reader of Holman&#x27;s strip, which was run daily in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Smokey Stover&#x27;s catch-phrase was &quot;where there&#x27;s foo, there&#x27;s fire&quot;. In a mission debriefing on the evening of November 27, 1944, Frederic &quot;Fritz&quot; Ringwald, the unit&#x27;s S-2 Intelligence Officer, stated that Meiers and Pilot Lt. Ed Schleuter had sighted a red ball of fire that appeared to chase them through a variety of high-speed maneuvers. Ringwald said that Meiers was extremely agitated and had a copy of the comic strip tucked in his back pocket. He pulled it out and slammed it down on Ringwald&#x27;s desk and said, &quot;[I]t was another one of those fuckin&#x27; foo fighters!&quot; and stormed out of the debriefing room.

According to Ringwald, because of the lack of a better name, it stuck. And this was originally what the men of the 415th started calling these incidents: &quot;fuckin&#x27; foo fighters&quot;. In December 1944, a press correspondent from the Associated Press in Paris, Bob Wilson, was sent to the 415th at their base outside of Dijon, France, to investigate this story. It was at this time that the term was cleaned up to just &quot;foo fighters&quot;. The squadron commander, Capt. Harold Augsperger, also decided to sanitize the term to &quot;foo fighters&quot; in the historical data of the squadron.

Other proposed origins of the term have been a corruption of the French &quot;feu&quot; for fire, and a corruption of the military acronym FUBAR (fucked up beyond all recognition).

==History==
Royal Air Force personnel had reported seeing lights following their aircraft from as early as March 1942, with similar sightings involving RAF bomber crews over the Balkans starting in April 1944. American sightings were first recorded by crews from the 422nd Night-Fighter Squadron stationed in Occupied Belgium during the first week of October 1944. At the time, these were erroneously believed to be Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-powered interceptors, which did not operate at night. However, the bulk of the sightings started occurring in the last week of November 1944, when pilots flying over Western Europe by night reported seeing fast-moving round glowing objects following their aircraft. The objects were variously described as fiery, and glowing red, white, or orange. Some pilots described them as resembling Christmas-tree lights and reported that they seemed to toy with the aircraft, making wild turns before simply vanishing. Pilots and aircrew reported that the objects flew together in formation with their aircraft and behaved as if they were under intelligent control, but never displayed hostile behavior. However, they could not be outmaneuvered or shot down. The phenomenon was so widespread that the lights earned a name – in the European Theater of Operations they were often called &quot;Kraut fireballs&quot;, but for the most part called &quot;foo fighters&quot;. The military took the sightings seriously, suspecting that the mysterious sightings might be secret German weapons, but further investigation revealed that German and Japanese pilots had reported similar sightings.

On 13 December 1944, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in Paris issued a press release, which was printed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; the next day, officially describing the phenomenon as a &quot;new German weapon&quot;. Follow-up stories, using the term &quot;Foo Fighters&quot;, appeared in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and the British &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.

In its 15 January 1945 edition, &quot;Time&quot; magazine carried a story titled &quot;Foo-Fighter&quot;, in which it reported that the &quot;balls of fire&quot; had been following USAAF night fighters for over a month, and that the pilots had named it the &quot;foo-fighter&quot;. According to &quot;Time&quot;, descriptions of the phenomena varied, but the pilots agreed that the mysterious lights followed their aircraft closely at high speed.

The &quot;balls of fire&quot; phenomenon reported from the Pacific Theater of Operations differed somewhat from the foo fighters reported from Europe; the &quot;ball of fire&quot; resembled a large burning sphere that &quot;just hung in the sky&quot;, though it was reported to sometimes follow aircraft. There was speculation that the phenomena could be related to the Japanese fire balloon campaign. As in Europe, no aircraft were reported as having been attacked by a &quot;ball of fire&quot;.

The postwar Robertson Panel cited foo fighter reports, noting that their behavior did not appear to be threatening, and mentioned possible explanations, for instance that they were electrostatic phenomena similar to St. Elmo&#x27;s fire, electromagnetic phenomena, or simply reflections of light from ice crystals. The Panel&#x27;s report suggested that &quot;If the term &#x27;flying saucers&#x27; had been popular in 1943–1945, these objects would have been so labeled.&quot;

===Sightings===
Foo fighters were reported on many occasions from around the world. Examples include:

* In September 1941 two sailors on the S.S. &quot;Pułaski,&quot; a Polish merchant vessel transporting British troops Indian Ocean, reported a &quot;strange globe glowing with greenish light, about half the size of the full moon as it appears to us.&quot; They alerted a British officer, who watched the movements of the object with them for over an hour.
* Pilot Officer Bryan Lumsden, a New Zealander flying with No.3 Squadron&#x27;s Night Flight, encountered two amber or orange-colored lights that followed him on an intruder mission over northern France in December 1942. One light was higher than the other, which appeared to rule out wing-tip navigation lights from an aircraft. The lights pursued him until he reached the English Channel. Another pilot from his unit experienced a similar phenomenon the following evening, with a green light. The story was eventually published in the Christchurch Star-Sun newspaper&#x27;s 4 November 1955 edition.
* 13 October 1944: An RAF crew from No.178 Squadron based in Italy reported seeing lights following their aircraft over Hungary during a night raid on Székesfehérvár. A B-24 Liberator KH103 flown by Pilot Officer Taylor was followed by an intermittent red light for several minutes. The squadron had started reporting numerous similar instances as early as April 1944 and would continue doing so throughout the remainder of 1944 and into 1945.
* Charles R. Bastien of the US Eighth Air Force reported one of the first encounters with foo fighters over the Belgium/Netherlands area; he described them as &quot;two fog lights flying at high that could change direction rapidly&quot;. During debriefing, his intelligence officer told him that two RAF nightfighters had reported the same thing, and it was later reported in British newspapers.
* Career U.S. Air Force pilot Duane Adams often related that he had witnessed two occurrences of a bright light which paced his aircraft for about half an hour and then rapidly ascended into the sky. Both incidents occurred at night, both over the South Pacific, and both were witnessed by the entire aircraft crew. The first sighting occurred shortly after the end of World War II while Adams piloted a B-25 bomber. The second sighting occurred in the early 1960s when Adams was piloting a KC-135 tanker.
* Senator Ted Stevens described an encounter from the time he was a US Air Force fighter pilot during World War II, as recounted by Senator Harry Reid: &quot;I was flying and there was an object next to me. I couldn’t get rid of it, I slowed up, it was there. I sped up, it was there. I would dive, it would be there. I called. Nothing on radar.&quot;

==Explanations and theories==
The 415th Night-Fighter Squadron&#x27;s Intelligence Officer, Captain Ringwald, sent a report listing 14 separate incidents in December 1944 and early January 1945 to the intelligence section at XII Tactical Air Command, the unit&#x27;s immediate superiors at 64th Fighter Wing being unable to offer any answers. Without answers of their own, XII TAC requested assistance from Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), in Paris. SHAEF had no knowledge of the phenomenon and asked if the British Air Ministry in London had any information. The Air Ministry&#x27;s explanation for the Foo Fighter phenomenon was received on 13 March 1945:

A group of scientists, engineers and former high-ranking Luftwaffe officers were questioned about wartime &quot;Balls of Fire&quot; reports by staff from United States Air Force in Europe&#x27;s intelligence section in the early autumn of 1945. None of the thirteen interviewed claimed any knowledge of a German secret weapons program that could have explained the sightings.

The author Renato Vesco revived the wartime theory that the foo fighters were a Nazi secret weapon in his work &quot;Intercept UFO&quot;, reprinted in a revised English edition as &quot;Man-Made UFOs: 50 Years of Suppression&quot; in 1994. Vesco claims that the foo fighters were in fact a form of ground-launched, automatically guided, jet-propelled flak mine called the &quot;Feuerball&quot; (Fireball). This device, supposedly operated by special SS units, resembled a tortoise shell in shape, and it flew by means of gas jets that spun like a Catherine wheel around the fuselage. Miniature klystron tubes inside the device, in combination with the gas jets, created the characteristic glowing spheroid appearance of the foo fighters. A crude form of collision avoidance radar ensured the craft would not crash into another airborne object, and an onboard sensor mechanism would even instruct the machine to depart swiftly if it was fired upon. The purpose of the &quot;Feuerball&quot;, according to Vesco, was twofold. The appearance of this weird device inside a bomber stream would (and indeed did) have a distracting and disruptive effect on the bomber pilots. Also, Vesco alleges that the devices were also intended to have an &quot;offensive&quot; capability. Electrostatic discharges from the klystron tubes would, he stated, interfere with the ignition systems of the bombers, causing the engines to stall and the planes to crash. Although there is no hard evidence to support the reality of the &quot;Feuerball&quot; drone, this theory has been taken up by other aviation/ufology authors, and it has even been cited by some as the most likely explanation for the phenomena in at least one recent TV &quot;documentary&quot; on Nazi secret weapons. However, others cite the single-sourced nature of the claims, the complete lack of evidence supporting them, and the implausible capabilities of the supposed device as marking this explanation as nonsense.

Any type of electrical discharge from the wings of airplanes (see St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire) has been suggested as an explanation, since it has been known to appear at the wingtips of aircraft. It has also been pointed out that some of the descriptions of foo fighters closely resemble those of ball lightning.

During April 1945, the U.S. Navy began to experiment on visual illusions as experienced by nighttime aviators. This work began the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Medicine (BUMED) project X-148-AV-4-3. This project pioneered the study of aviators&#x27; vertigo and was initiated because a wide variety of anomalous events were being reported by nighttime aviators. Edgar Vinacke, who was the prime flight psychologist on this project, summarized the need for a cohesive and systemic outline of the epidemiology of aviators&#x27; vertigo:

<text>San Pablo Guelatao is a town and the seat of the Municipality of Guelatao de Juárez, in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It is part of the Ixtlán District in the Sierra Norte de Oaxaca region.

Guelatao, as it is often called, is in the foothills of the Sierra de Juárez, a mountain range in the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca System. It is about 55 km north of the city of Oaxaca.

==The town==

Guelatao is the birthplace of President Benito Juárez, whose parents were Zapotec peasants. He was the first indigenous president of Mexico. When he was born, Guelatao had a population of fewer than 100 people, and fell under the jurisdiction of the larger neighbouring town of Ixtlán. Juárez was baptised in the parish church at Ixtlán, which is now known as Ixtlán de Juárez in his honour. Guelatao became an independent municipality in 1824, after Mexico gained independence from Spain. The town has a small museum dedicated to Juárez.

XEGLO, a government-run indigenous community radio station that broadcasts in Zapotec, Mixe and Chinantec, is based in Guelatao.

===Demographics===
In 2005 San Pablo Guelatao had 111 households, with a population of about 476 people. It is largely rural. The majority of the population are indigenous Zapotec.

==The municipality==
The Municipality of Guelatao de Juárez (named for the president) has governing jurisdiction over the communities of Llano de la Cheta and Río Grande. It is part of the Ixtlán District. San Pablo Guelatao is the seat of the municipality.

<doc id="195890" wikidata="Q971196" url="?curid=195890" title="White-winged chough">
<text>The white-winged chough (Corcorax melanorhamphos) is one of only two surviving members of the Australian mud-nest builders family, Corcoracidae, and is the only member of the genus Corcorax. It is native to southern and eastern Australia and is an example of convergent evolution as it is only distantly related to the European choughs that it closely resembles in shape, and for which it was named.

==Taxonomy==
The white-winged chough was first described by French naturalist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1817 as &quot;Coracia melanorhamphos&quot;, other names given include &quot;Pyrrhocorax leucopterus&quot; by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820, and &quot;Corcorax australis&quot; by French naturalist René Lesson in 1830. before the current name was settled by Gregory Mathews in 1912. The specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;melano-&quot; &#x27;black&#x27; and &quot;rhamphos&quot; &#x27;beak&#x27;.

It is placed in the family known as the mud-nest builders or Corcoracidae, written as Grallinidae in older books before the removal of the genus &quot;Grallina&quot; to the family Monarchidae. It is one of two remaining species, with the apostlebird (&quot;Struthidea cinerea&quot;), which differs in appearance but exhibits many behavioural similarities. The mudnest builder family Corcoracidae itself is now placed in a narrower &#x27;Core corvine&#x27; group, which contains the crows and ravens, shrikes, birds of paradise, fantails, monarch flycatchers, and drongos.

It is only distantly related to the red-billed chough (&quot;Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax&quot;) and Alpine chough (&quot;P. graculus&quot;), which are members of the crow family Corvidae. The similarities in appearance of dark plumage and downturned bill are the result of convergent evolution.

==Description==

White-winged choughs are easily recognised but often mistaken for &quot;crows&quot; (such as the Australian raven). The white-winged chough is a large, black bird—at about only a little smaller than a raven or a little larger than an Australian magpie—but has red eyes and a finer, slightly down-curved beak, similar to a European chough. These red eyes become swollen and brighter in colour when the bird is excited. In flight the large white patches in the wings are immediately obvious, and explain the descriptive part of their common name.

Their calls consist primarily of a grating alarm call and a descending piping call. The latter call is diagnostic for the bird in the wild, being significantly different in timbre and melody to that of other birds sharing their habitat.

==Behaviour==

Flight is a mixture of a slow, deep flapping and short glides: unlike their European namesakes, white-winged choughs are not particularly strong or agile fliers and spend the great majority of their time on the ground, foraging methodically through leaf litter for worms, insects, grain, and snails in a loose group, walking with a distinctive swagger, and calling softly to one another every few seconds. A rich find is the cause of general excitement and all come running in to share in it. The family group walks several kilometres each day through its large territory, foraging as it goes, taking to the air only if disturbed.

Choughs are territorial and highly social, living in flocks of from about 4 up to about 20 birds, usually all the offspring of a single pair. Because raising of young is a group effort bands of chough may kidnap fledglings from other family groups so that they will be able to help them to raise their chicks next year.

===Feeding===


The white-winged chough will forage in litter and rotten wood for termites and beetles. Although birds have eaten pieces of apple placed out for them on feeding tables, they have not been recorded eating fruit on trees. This species has been observed eating cherry tomatoes, whole, in eastern Australian, Newcastle region.

The diet is varied, the white-winged chough eats seeds of various grasses (Poaceae), &quot;Gahnia grandis&quot;, &quot;Atriplex&quot;, &quot;Epacris&quot;, &quot;Hibbertia&quot;, &quot;Solanum&quot;, &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Exocarpos&quot; species, as well as introduced species such as the cursed thistle (&quot;Cirsium arvense&quot;), roadside thistle (&quot;C. vulgare&quot;), winter honeysuckle (&quot;Lonicera fragrantissima&quot;), &quot;Convolvulus&quot; and &quot;Oxalis&quot; species. Berries of the introduced &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; and &quot;Crataegus&quot; are also consumed. It eats a wide variety of arthropods, including centipedes, millipedes and many types of insect—beetles, cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers and crickets, flies, butterflies and moths, and ants, bees and wasps. In some areas, it will readily approach tourist sites to find supplementary food.

===Breeding===
Nesting and breeding is communal, all members of the family helping to raise the young - a process that takes several years, as young birds must learn the art of finding food in the dry Australian bush. Larger families have a better chance of breeding success: so much so that given the opportunity choughs will kidnap the youngsters of neighboring families in order to recruit them to the team.

Breeding season is from August to December. The nest is a deep cup-shaped structure made of grasses held together with mud or sometimes manure in a tree fork up to 10 metres above the ground. Three to five cream-coloured eggs sparsely splotched with dark brown and lavender shades are laid measuring 30 mm x 40 mm.

There is one report of white-winged choughs occupying and using a nest which was likely to have been built by the Australian magpie. However, this was unable to be confirmed as the nest was not witnessed being built.

All members of a family take turns to incubate, preen, and feed youngsters, and all cooperate in defending the nest against predators. However, the juveniles, who are highly inefficient foragers, have been observed to engage in deception; they bring food back to the nest and make to feed nestlings, but instead wait until unobserved, and then eat it themselves. This behaviour disappeared when food sources were artificially supplemented. There are three main threats to young choughs: starvation; predation by nest-robbing birds, particularly currawongs; and sabotage by neighbouring chough families anxious to protect their food supply by restricting competition. Larger family groups are better able to deal with all three threats.

Nesting in communal groups is essential: pairs, or even trios, of birds are almost never successful in raising young. Young take six to seven months to reach independence a significant time-span for birds but they repay the long investment by returning to the nest the next year and helping raise the next generation.

<doc id="195891" wikidata="Q211500" url="?curid=195891" title="Pneumatics">
<text>Pneumatics (from Greek &#x27;wind, breath&#x27;) is the use of gas or pressurized air in mechanical systems.

Pneumatic systems used in industry are commonly powered by compressed air or compressed inert gases. A centrally located and electrically-powered compressor powers cylinders, air motors, pneumatic actuators, and other pneumatic devices. A pneumatic system controlled through manual or automatic solenoid valves is selected when it provides a lower cost, more flexible, or safer alternative to electric motors, and hydraulic actuators.

Pneumatics also has applications in dentistry, construction, mining, and other areas.

==Gases used in pneumatic systems==

Pneumatic systems in fixed installations, such as factories, use compressed air because a sustainable supply can be made by compressing atmospheric air. The air usually has moisture removed, and a small quantity of oil is added at the compressor to prevent corrosion and lubricate mechanical components.

Factory-plumbed pneumatic-power users need not worry about poisonous leakage, as the gas is usually just air. Any compressed gas other than air is an asphyxiation hazard—including nitrogen, which makes up 78% of air. Compressed oxygen (approx. 21% of air) would not asphyxiate, but is not used in pneumatically-powered devices because it is a fire hazard, more expensive, and offers no performance advantage over air. Smaller or stand-alone systems can use other compressed gases that present an asphyxiation hazard, such as nitrogen—often referred to as OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen) when supplied in cylinders.

Portable pneumatic tools and small vehicles, such as Robot Wars machines and other hobbyist applications are often powered by compressed carbon dioxide, because containers designed to hold it such as SodaStream canisters and fire extinguishers are readily available, and the phase change between liquid and gas makes it possible to obtain a larger volume of compressed gas from a lighter container than compressed air requires. Carbon dioxide is an asphyxiant and can be a freezing hazard if vented improperly.

==History==
Although the early history of pneumatics is murky, the field&#x27;s founder is traditionally traced back to Ctesibius of Alexandria &quot;who worked in the early 3rd century BCE and invented a number of mechanical toys operated by air, water, and steam under pressure.&quot; Though no documents written by Ctesibius survive, he is thought to have heavily influenced Philo of Byzantium while writing his work, &quot;Mechanical Syntaxis&quot;, as well as Vitruvius in . In the first century BC, the ancient Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria compiled recipes for dozens of contraptions in his work, Pneumatics. It has been speculated that much of this work can be attributed to Ctesibius. The pneumatic experiments described in these ancient documents later inspired the Renaissance inventors of the thermoscope and the air thermometer, devices which relied upon the heating and cooling of air to move a column of water up and down a tube.

German physicist Otto von Guericke (1602-1686) invented the vacuum pump, a device that can draw out air or gas from the attached vessel. He demonstrated the vacuum pump to separate the pairs of copper hemispheres using air pressures. The field of pneumatics has changed considerably over the years. It has moved from small handheld devices to large machines with multiple parts that serve different functions.

==Comparison to hydraulics==
Both pneumatics and hydraulics are applications of fluid power. Pneumatics uses an easily compressible gas such as air or a suitable pure gas—while hydraulics uses relatively incompressible liquid media such as oil. Most industrial pneumatic applications use pressures of about . Hydraulics applications commonly use from , but specialized applications may exceed . 

===Advantages of pneumatics===
*&quot;Simplicity of design and control&quot;—Machines are easily designed using standard cylinders and other components, and operate via simple on-off control.
*&quot;Reliability&quot;—Pneumatic systems generally have long operating lives and require little maintenance. Because gas is compressible, equipment is less subject to shock damage. Gas absorbs excessive force, whereas fluid in hydraulics directly transfers force. Compressed gas can be stored, so machines still run for a while if electrical power is lost.
*&quot;Safety&quot;—There is a very low chance of fire compared to hydraulic oil. New machines are usually overload safe to a certain limit.

===Advantages of hydraulics===
* Fluid does not absorb any of the supplied energy.
* Capable of moving much higher loads and providing much lower forces due to the incompressibility.
* The hydraulic working fluid is practically incompressible, leading to a minimum of spring action. When hydraulic fluid flow is stopped, the slightest motion of the load releases the pressure on the load; there is no need to &quot;bleed off&quot; pressurized air to release the pressure on the load.
* Highly responsive compared to pneumatics.
* Supply more power than pneumatics.
* Can also do many purposes at one time: lubrication, cooling and power transmission.

==Pneumatic logic==

Pneumatic logic systems (sometimes called air logic control) are sometimes used for controlling industrial processes, consisting of primary logic units like:

*And units
*Or units
*Relay or booster units
*Latching units
*Timer units
* Fluidics amplifiers with no moving parts other than the air itself

Pneumatic logic is a reliable and functional control method for industrial processes. In recent years, these systems have largely been replaced by electronic control systems in new installations because of the smaller size, lower cost, greater precision, and more powerful features of digital controls. Pneumatic devices are still used where upgrade cost, or safety factors dominate.

<doc id="195903" wikidata="Q284798" url="?curid=195903" title="Abraxas (album)">
<text>Abraxas is the second studio album by American Latin rock band Santana. It was released on September 23, 1970, by Columbia Records and became the band&#x27;s first album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the album number 334 in its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

== Title ==
The title of the album originates from a line in Hermann Hesse&#x27;s 1919 book &quot;Demian&quot;, quoted on the album&#x27;s back cover: &quot;We stood before it and began to freeze inside from the exertion. We questioned the painting, berated it, made love to it, prayed to it: We called it mother, called it whore and slut, called it our beloved, called it Abraxas...&quot;

== Songs ==

Carlos Santana had been interested in Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s leader and songwriter Peter Green, having seen him perform at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, and decided to cover the band&#x27;s song &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot;. (Both had also been influenced as guitarists by B.B. King.) The band added a cover of Gábor Szabó&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Gypsy Queen&quot; to the end. &quot;Oye Como Va&quot; was a hit by Tito Puente in the early 1960s and the group played it live regularly, as they realized it was good for audiences to dance to.

&quot;Incident at Neshabur&quot; was co-written by Santana and his friend Alberto Gianquinto, who played piano on the track. Gregg Rolie played the other keyboards, contrasting with Gianquinto&#x27;s jazz-influenced style. It ran through various time and key signatures.

The instrumental, &quot;Samba Pa Ti&quot; (&quot;Samba for You&quot;), was written by Santana when he saw a jazz saxophonist performing in the street outside his apartment.
It was later covered by José Feliciano, who added lyrics, and also by Angélique Kidjo, who put lyrics in Yoruba, on her album &quot;Oyo&quot;. It is also one of the tracks featured in Nick Hornby&#x27;s book &quot;31 Songs&quot;.

The first three songs on side one segue into each other, creating a 14-minute, 28-second mini-suite.

== Cover art ==
The album cover features the 1961 painting &quot;Annunciation&quot; by German-French painter Mati Klarwein. According to the artist, it was one of the first paintings he did after relocating to New York City. Carlos Santana reportedly noticed it in a magazine and asked that it be on the cover of the band&#x27;s upcoming album. On the back of the record sleeve the cover art is just credited to &#x27;MATI&#x27;. It is now considered a classic of rock album covers. Klarwein went on to design album artwork for many notable artists, including Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, and Gregg Allman.

== Critical reception ==

In 2003, the album was ranked No. 205 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, at No. 207 on the 2012 revision of the list, and then again at No. 334 in its 2020 release. In 2000, it appeared at No. 202 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2015, the album was listed among &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 50 Essential Latin Albums of the 50 Past Years.

Rock critic Robert Christgau, in one of his capsule reviews in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, at the time of the album&#x27;s release, gave it a rating of only C+, which denotes &quot;a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Abraxas&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in their National Recording Registry in 2015.

<doc id="195915" wikidata="Q208568" url="?curid=195915" title="Everybody Loves Raymond">
<text>Everybody Loves Raymond is an American television sitcom created by Philip Rosenthal that aired on CBS from September 13, 1996, to May 16, 2005, with a total of 210 episodes spanning nine seasons. It was produced by Where&#x27;s Lunch and Worldwide Pants Incorporated, in association with HBO Independent Productions. The cast members were Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Brad Garrett, Doris Roberts, Peter Boyle, Madylin Sweeten, and Monica Horan. Most episodes of the nine-season series were filmed in front of a live studio audience.

The series received positive reviews and has been ranked the 49th all-time funniest television comedy by &quot;Complex&quot;, the 60th best all-time series by &quot;TV Guide&quot;, the eleventh-best sitcom starring a stand-up comedian and the 35th best sitcom of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and (alongside &quot;South Park&quot;) the 63rd best written television series by the Writers Guild of America. In a &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; poll of all-time television programs surveying 779 actors, 365 producers and 268 directors, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; ranked 96th.

== Series overview ==
The show is centered on the day-to-day life of an Italian-American named Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Barone, a sportswriter for &quot;Newsday&quot; living with his family on Long Island. Beleaguered and diffident yet dryly sarcastic, Ray takes few things seriously, making jokes in most situations, no matter how serious. He avoids responsibilities around the house and with his kids, leaving them to his wife, Debra, resulting in her being angry and stressed out quite often.

Ray and Debra have a daughter Ally (Alexandra) and twin sons Michael and Geoffrey; the Barone children are regular characters but not a major focus. Raymond&#x27;s parents, Marie and Frank, live across the street with their older son Robert (who, later has his own apartment). The Barone relatives frequently make their presence known to the annoyance of Ray and Debra. Although she loves them, Debra&#x27;s justifiable complaints about Ray&#x27;s overbearing family serve as one of the show&#x27;s comedic elements. Out of the three unwanted visitors, Debra is particularly resentful of Marie, an insulting, controlling, manipulative woman who criticizes her passive-aggressively and praises Ray, clearly favoring him over other son Robert.

Ray typically falls in the middle of family arguments, incapable of taking any decisive stand, especially if it might invoke Marie&#x27;s disapproval. Robert, jealous of his younger sibling&#x27;s position as their mother&#x27;s favorite son and the success his brother has achieved professionally and personally, is Ray&#x27;s biggest rival; Robert and Ray frequently argue like overgrown children, focusing much of their energy picking on or one-upping each other, although deep down they love each other dearly.

Frank Barone is a retiree prone to directing insults and merciless put-downs at everyone he meets. Largely an absentee father when Ray and Robert were growing up, Frank buries his feelings and rarely yields to sentiment. As the series progresses, however, several episodes demonstrate that he loves his family immensely. Unlike everyone else, Frank has no problem criticizing Marie and often comes to Debra&#x27;s defense, whenever Marie comments disparagingly about their daughter-in-law.

Ray and Debra&#x27;s marriage is fraught with conflicts. Ray prefers sports television over discussions with Debra on marital matters. Ray works full-time, as his father had, leaving most child-rearing responsibilities to his wife, and he is often forced against his will to help around the house. One of the show&#x27;s recurring elements finds the couple having a long discussion in bed, before going to sleep.

==Episodes==

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

==Characters==

* Ray Barone (Ray Romano) is a sportswriter for &quot;Newsday&quot;. He lives in Lynbrook, Long Island with his wife, Debra, and their three children Alexandra (&quot;Ally&quot;), Geoffrey, and Michael. His parents Frank and Marie and brother Robert live across the street. Raymond&#x27;s character is loosely based on the real-life Romano, as he is the father of twin boys and a girl. Ray is emotionally unable to take any sort of stand on anything, especially if it brings him to any sort of conflict with his mother—the exception is when he protests about sex or some trivial matter. Raymond&#x27;s mother favors him over Robert.
* Debra Barone (Patricia Heaton) is Raymond&#x27;s wife, and mother of Ally, Michael and Geoffrey. As a housewife, Debra claims she is frequently overworked, underappreciated, and stressed out. This leads to her yelling and occasionally attacking inanimate objects, largely because she has to deal with all the housework and her three rambunctious children with almost no assistance or support from Raymond; additionally, she constantly puts up with Marie&#x27;s intrusiveness and criticism. On frequent occasions this frustration boils over and is vented towards Raymond. While Debra has a fractious relationship with Marie, she is shown to share many tender moments with Robert, and occasionally Frank.
* Robert Barone (Brad Garrett) is Raymond&#x27;s older brother and the son of Frank and Marie. Standing at 6&#x27;8½&quot; (2.04 m), he is the tallest Barone, and has several quirks, the biggest being a nervous habit of touching food to his chin before eating it, once referred to as &quot;crazy chin&quot;. Robert is often jealous of the attention that Raymond receives from their mother, to the exclusion of his every achievement. Robert has been a New York City police officer for over 23 years (explicitly stated as 15 years early in season 1) and attains the rank of lieutenant by the end of the series. His height, appearance, and depressed demeanor are the source of much humor. However, despite his imposing size, Robert is a very skilled dancer. Divorced from first wife Joanne prior to the beginning of the series, he is frequently unlucky with women, until his on-off relationship with his girlfriend Amy McDougall finally results in marriage. Also, despite his tough appearance, he appears to be more sensitive, affectionate, tender and open to sharing his emotions compared to the rest of his family.
* Marie Barone (Doris Roberts) is Raymond and Robert&#x27;s mother and the wife of Frank. Intrusive, controlling, manipulative, and over-nurturing (at least with Raymond), she is a housewife who excels in cooking, cleaning, and other things dealing with keeping a good home and family. Marie and Frank live across the street from Raymond and Debra in Lynbrook, Long Island, New York which often irritates the latter couple. Marie&#x27;s meddling tendencies include going through their mail, redoing their laundry, and upstaging Debra in the kitchen. She also goes to great lengths to control Robert&#x27;s love life and get him to settle down and bring her more grandchildren.
* Frank Barone (Peter Boyle) is Raymond&#x27;s father and Marie&#x27;s husband, a retired bookkeeper, and registered real estate agent, with a stubborn masculine personality and no interest in personal hygiene. A United States Army veteran, Frank served in the Korean War, which he frequently brings up to everyone&#x27;s annoyance. He mocks his sons&#x27; inability to handle their own personal and domestic problems; unlike his sons, he is not intimidated by Marie and disparages her regularly with little to no provocation. Although both he and Marie maintain that he only married her for her cooking, he is shown to care about her genuinely. He is a member of the Order of the Caribou Lodge, and was named Man of the Year by his fellow members.
* Amy MacDougall (Monica Horan) (recurring seasons 1–7, starring seasons 8 &amp; 9) becomes Robert Barone&#x27;s second wife (in season 7), and is the best friend of Debra, who introduces her to Robert. A recurring character for the first seven seasons of the series, Amy became essentially a regular cast member for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run. However, Horan&#x27;s name did not get added to the opening credits until the final season. Many issues cause Amy and Robert to break up in the first six seasons, with one being blamed on Raymond, and another happening because Robert was seeing other women, one of whom was his ex-wife. Quite often, Amy apologizes to someone even if she did not do anything wrong. She was born to very religious parents who, according to Amy, &quot;wouldn&#x27;t yell if they were on fire.&quot; In real life, Horan is married to creator/executive producer Philip Rosenthal.
* Ally Barone (Madylin Sweeten) is the daughter of Raymond and Debra. She is the oldest of the Barone children. She is not seen much, even though she is credited in the main cast. She is said to be a better cook than her mother, and maybe someday her grandmother. In real life, Madylin is the sister of Sawyer and Sullivan Sweeten.
* Geoffrey Barone (Sawyer Sweeten) and Michael Barone (Sullivan Sweeten) are the twin sons of Raymond and Debra. Their names in the pilot were Gregory and Matthew. In real life, twins Sawyer and Sullivan are brothers of Madylin Sweeten.

== Development ==
=== Conception ===

In the 1990s, several television shows based on work from stand-up comedians, such as &quot;Home Improvement&quot; (1991–99) and &quot;Roseanne&quot; (1988–97), were successful. Ray Romano, a comedian for 12 years by the time &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; first aired, was one such comic to get development deals following a five-minute performance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in the middle of 1995. &quot;David Letterman&quot; executive producer Rob Burnett recalled that &quot;by the end [of the monologue] we already had lawyers lined up to work a deal with him.&quot;

In looking for a show-runner, Romano wanted somebody to share his tastes in humor, avoiding those who were into writing &quot;devicey&quot; material. Around a dozen candidates for the show-runner position were considered before &quot;Coach&quot; writer Philip Rosenthal, who sent a &quot;Frasier&quot; spec script to Letterman&#x27;s Worldwide Pants. The company read the spec and sent Rosenthal a tape of Romano asking screenwriters to help him with an upcoming show based on his work; also in the tape, he stated that he had a hard time coming up with new material because of having to raise twin sons, and showcased a &quot;new bit&quot; of him shaking keys while saying &quot;hey&quot;. Romano&#x27;s sense of humor intrigued Rosenthal, reminding him of Bill Cosby&#x27;s early work.

After viewing the tape, Rosenthal met with Romano in person at Art&#x27;s Delicatessen &amp; Restaurant on Ventura Boulevard about being a potential show runner. The encounter consisted of Romano and Rosenthal each discussing their families. Romano told Rosenthal he wanted to do a series about a comedian discussing current issues with friends at a coffee shop, but Rosenthal responded that kind of sitcom already existed and was a hit. Rosenthal, intrigued by Romano&#x27;s crazy family fables and wanting to work around his lack of previous acting experience, then stated it would be most &quot;comfortable&quot; for Romano to have the Raymond character be very close to his real personality and in family circumstances reflective of Romano&#x27;s home life. Although Romano has a brother named Robert in real life, he based the Robert in &quot;Raymond&quot; on another one of his brothers, Richard. Rosenthal also incorporated his own family experiences into the show, with his mother and wife serving as the basis for Marie and Debra respectively.

Most aspects of Romano&#x27;s real life are replicated in the series, except for its setting of Long Island instead of Queens; Romano and the writers initially wanted the show to be set in Queens, but CBS executives ultimately chose Long Island due to its broad appeal, as it was a suburb with urban elements. Previous prime-time television series set in Long Island, such as &quot;The Hamptons&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Pruitts of Southampton&quot; (1966–67), never went beyond one season. Romano also explained, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot more kissing on the show than in real life&quot;; and his wife Anna continued, &quot;and they talk a lot more in the show than we ever do at home.&quot; The title &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; originated from a response Romano&#x27;s brother Richard made after Ray won a CableACE stand-up award: &quot;I had a day where people were shooting at me, and you&#x27;re bringing home trophies. Everybody loves Raymond, don&#x27;t they?&quot; In the show&#x27;s pilot, Robert states &quot;Everybody loves Raymond.&quot;

Rosenthal pitched the show to CBS president Les Moonves, CBS comedy vice president David Himelfarb, CBS comedy development executive Wendi Goldstein, and CBS comedy and drama development head Gene Stein. He kept the pitch very simple: &quot;it&#x27;s [Romano] and his family, and his parents live across the street with his brother.&quot; CBS was lukewarm towards the show&#x27;s low concept, but found it enough of a low-risk investment for the series to be green-lit. Letterman&#x27;s involvement with &quot;Raymond&quot; amounted to nothing more than a meeting where he signed Rosenthal&#x27;s show-runner contract and told him, &quot;just don&#x27;t embarrass us.&quot;

=== Casting ===

For the non-titular lead roles of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, casting director Lisa Miller chose Patricia Heaton and Brad Garrett, who made several appearances in sitcoms before; and Doris Roberts and Peter Boyle, both film actors. &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; was Heaton&#x27;s fourth lead role in a sitcom after the short-lived &quot;Room for Two&quot; (1992–1993), &quot;Some Like Me&quot; (1994), and &quot;Women of the House&quot; (1995). When she read the pilot script during pilot season, she thought it was &quot;beautifully written&quot; although found the character of Debra uninteresting. Miller explained that she had to &quot;Taft-Hartley&quot; Romano, who did not have much acting experience before &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, in order to get around legal Screen Actors Guild requirements to star in the show. He also needed trainers to make sure he performed the character of a likable protagonist well.

Garrett (like Romano, also a stand up comedian) was the first actor to be cast after Romano, as well as the only actor to audition without Romano in the room. Garrett explained that while CBS initially wanted a small, Danny DeVito-esque character who had a &quot;bulldog&quot; attitude towards Raymond, he, a much taller actor, portrayed Robert as more &quot;beaten-down&quot; and &quot;succumb to the fact that he&#x27;s a loser&quot; when auditioning.

For the auditions of Heaton, Boyle, and Roberts, they were in the moods of the characters in the scenes they performed, and their auditions were very quick. Heaton was in the middle of getting-by doing babysitting work and clipping coupons when auditioning, making her very stressed. Miller chose Heaton for the role of Debra for being &quot;very focused, real, like Helen Hunt in &quot;Mad About You&quot;.&quot; Boyle, an actor recommended for Frank by Moonves, had a troublesome time getting to his audition location due to schedule changes and poor directions, which made him very grumpy and &quot;in character&quot; when he arrived. Rosenthal admitted to casting Boyle &quot;out of fear&quot; in response to Boyle&#x27;s bitter attitude. Roberts was called by the casting team for the role of Marie after going through more than 100 actresses. She was initially reluctant to audition due to being busy with directing a 23-character play, but her agents insisted she had time; an &quot;overwhelmed&quot; Roberts did zero preparation, which was unusual for her, and performed her audition from her &quot;gut reaction.&quot;

== Production ==
Each episode was created in a workweek that consisted of actors reading through and rehearsing the script on Monday, actors rehearsing and the writers tweaking the script on Tuesday, CBS running through what the actors rehearsed on Wednesday, camera blocking on Thursday, and filming on Friday. A typical writing session started with each of the writers discussing their lives, which served as the basis for episode scripts; as Rosenthal summarized the process, &quot;talking, talking, talking and then all of a sudden, that&#x27;s a story.&quot; Will MacKenzie, who directed for &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; on the second, third, and fourth seasons, recalled the writers being so efficient that thirteen episode scripts were completed by the time a season began airing. When shooting episodes, Rosenthal was very stern about the actors sticking to the script and avoiding ad libing, although &quot;alternative&quot; lines were put in the script for some episodes.

Garrett compared acting in episodes of &quot;Raymond&quot; to the improvisational methods used by the cast in &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1989–98). Garrett had appeared in a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode, playing an obsessed car mechanic that steals Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s car.

The house used for exterior shots of Ray and Debra&#x27;s home is located at 135 Margaret Boulevard in Merrick, New York and was worth $500,000 ; as in the show, it is located across the street from the home used for exteriors of Frank and Marie&#x27;s house (house number 136).
== Style ==
For &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, Rosenthal went for a classic sitcom style a la &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; (1955–56), avoiding references to current culture in order to give it a timeless quality. Jeremy Stevens stated that the show differed from most sitcoms of its time for its focus on storytelling and reflection on most people&#x27;s real lives.

Julie Pernworth, a comedy development president at CBS, categorized &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; as &quot;one of the most traditional sitcoms to come along in a long time.&quot; As Rosenthal put it, &quot;Raymond&quot; was a &quot;sophisticated&quot; version of a family sitcom, which was emphasized via the show&#x27;s piano-heavy background music and the use of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; typeface for credits. In composing the show&#x27;s theme, Terry Trotter and Rick Marotta used the first few measures of a song from Woody Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979) and improvised the rest of the piece. Episodes of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; are emotionally dynamic presentations of otherwise prosaic premises typical for traditional sitcoms.

SUNY Press&#x27; book &quot;The Sitcom Reader&quot; (2016) analyzed &quot;Raymond&quot; was part of a trend in 1990s television of family sitcoms geared towards older audiences, which resulted in the scripts not focusing so much on the child characters and being entirely about grown-ups bickering at each other. While the second season was in production, Romano expressed the challenge of having to write &quot;weird&quot; adult humor within &quot;parameters&quot; of a show about a family: &quot;I want to write a show where I have anxiety attacks, and we&#x27;re all very concerned about that. Can the star of the show be a father who has anxiety attacks and flips out? Will that sit well with people?&quot; This involved trying to keep the presence of the child characters as little as possible: &quot;To be upstaged by toddlers? I get enough of that at home.&quot; As Romano described the stand-up material the show is based on upon the show&#x27;s first season airing, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be a spokesman for family values, but that&#x27;s the way my standup is perceived. My character is a father who loves his family but who would also love a little freedom.&quot; According to TV critic Jones Ostrow, &quot;Raymond&quot; &quot;explored the tortuous/loving relationships of parents and adult children, of couples, of siblings and the Peter Pan syndrome that attaches to baby boomer males, sports nuts in particular.&quot;

== Connection to other sitcoms ==

Kevin James was an actor and writer on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. Once James got his own show, &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, the two shows crossed over.

The first crossover happened on &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. In it, Ray Barone and Doug Heffernan become friends. Later on the same night, Kevin James showed up on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; as Doug Heffernan. The shows crossed over several more times.

Ray Romano also turned up in an episode of &quot;The Nanny&quot;: when that show&#x27;s Fran Fine (Fran Drescher) attends her high school reunion, one of her classmates is revealed to be Ray Barone. (Romano and Drescher were real-life classmates at Hillcrest High School in Jamaica, Queens in the 1970s.)

Ray Romano and Peter Boyle appeared as their respective characters in the episode &quot;Lucas Raymondicus&quot; of &quot;Cosby&quot;, another CBS show, in 1997.

==Foreign remakes==

===Russian version and documentary===
In 2009, series creator/producer Philip Rosenthal traveled to Russia to adapt the show for local audiences. His experience was documented by a film crew and released as the documentary feature &quot;Exporting Raymond&quot;. 
The Russian version is titled &quot;Воронины&quot; (&quot;Voronin&#x27;s Family&quot;, a Russian surname sounding similar to the family&#x27;s name, The Barones).

===Other versions===
The show was adapted in Poland under the title &quot;Wszyscy kochają Romana&quot; (Everybody Loves Roman). It was picked up by TVN and premiered on September 2, 2011. However, due to low ratings (fewer than 2 million viewers a week), the station put the show on hiatus after four episodes.

In Egypt, a sitcom called &quot;El Bab Fil Bab&quot; (الباب في الباب ), which means &quot;Close Doors&quot; in Arabic, is produced by Sony Pictures Television, translating &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; with minor changes to adapt the Eastern Culture. The first season aired in the month of Ramadan 2011; second season in 2012.

A Dutch remake called &quot;Iedereen is gek op Jack&quot; (&quot;Everybody is crazy about Jack&quot;) premiered in February 2011. The second season started airing in March 2012 and ended in May 2012.

An Israeli remake called &quot;Mishpacah Lo Bochrim&quot; (משפחה לא בוחרים) (&quot;You Can&#x27;t Choose Your Family&quot;)
premiered in October 2012, and was cancelled after 10 episodes aired.

A pilot for a British remake, titled &quot;The Smiths&quot;, was commissioned to be produced for BBC One and was filmed in May 2013 at Elstree Studios. Lee Mack wrote and starred in the pilot, as Michael Smith. The pilot also starred Catherine Tate, Tom Davis, Gwen Taylor and David Troughton.

A Czech remake called &quot;Rudyho Má Každý Rád&quot; (Everybody Loves Rudy) premiered on ČT1 on August 31, 2015, comprising 12 episodes.

==Syndication==
On December 20, 1998, two Tribune Broadcasting stations, WPIX New York and KTLA Los Angeles, bought rights for syndication of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; from Eyemark Entertainment; &quot;Variety&quot; reported Eyemark receiving a license fee of $90,000 to $100,000 per week and barter advertising of one-and-a-half minutes. Although Eyemark planned for the two stations to start the re-runs in fall 2000, it moved the date to fall 2001 to avoid competition with other sitcoms beginning off-network runs in 2000. The deal allowed the two stations to re-run the show for four-and-a-half years. On January 26, 1999, the cable channel TBS paid &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; distributor Eyemark Entertainment for four years of syndication rights of the show starting in the fall of 2004.

From 2001 to 2016, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; was in Broadcast syndication on local stations in television markets across the United States. Currently the show can be seen on TV Land and has aired on TBS from 2004 to 2021. In Canada, the show can be seen on CMT and DejaView.

The show is still broadcast regularly in the United Kingdom. From 2000 to 2007, King World distributed the show for off-network syndication and Warner Bros. International Television handled international distribution. In 2007, CBS Television Distribution took over King World&#x27;s distribution. CBS only owns American syndication rights; ancillary rights are controlled by HBO and Warner Bros. Television (WBIT distributes the series outside the US in conjunction with HBO; while Warner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment own DVD rights worldwide). The show aired every morning as a double bill on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, as part of its Breakfast line up from 08:00-09:00, and, as of 2024 continues to be shown most weekday mornings until it was replaced by The King of Queens in September 2024.

&quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; also airs on Channel 4 &amp; Comedy Central in the United Kingdom and in Australia on Network 10, on 10 Peach (a sub-channel of Network 10) and on Foxtel&#x27;s Pay TV network TVH!TS previously called TV1 (formerly aired on FOX Classics). The show reruns in India on the channel Romedy Now.

==Home media==
HBO released the Complete Series of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; on DVD in Regions 1, 2, and 4. Region 4 Complete Box Set was released on August 13, 2008. In Australia, the first five seasons were re-released in 2006 in slimmer packaging (originals were wide spine cases). Also, some were released with a cardboard slip cover. In North America the DVDs were repackaged between 2009 and 2012 in standard sized DVD packaging. All episodes were available on Netflix for streaming until September 1, 2016, also the date &quot;Exporting Raymond&quot; was taken off the platform. Also on September 14, 2004, The Complete 1st Season was released on VHS. The sixth-season DVD set contained the episode &quot;Marie&#x27;s Sculpture&quot;, which previously had not aired in the United Kingdom and was not released until almost five years after the end of the 6th season.

== Streaming ==

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; critic David Kronke praised &quot;Raymond&quot; for being &quot;the quintessentially honest sitcom. It&#x27;s neither too hokey nor too crass. It depicts families as dissolute yet inextricably bound together, just like they really are, and finds the humor in those real frictions that threaten, yet never manage, to burst family units apart. Its characterizations are among the most finely defined on TV. Debra, with her vaguely no-nonsense disgust of Raymond&#x27;s simpleton-ness, is unlike any sitcom mom ever. Doris Roberts&#x27; Marie had a sinister streak long before Nancy Marchand&#x27;s Livia showed up on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Raymond is also one of the few contemporary sitcoms that has figured out how to implement and even exploit the four-camera, live-audience situation, which is no simple feat.&quot;

A 1997 review by Bruce Fretts, which gave the show the same score, said that the show &quot;may now be the best sitcom on the air.&quot; Common Sense Media&#x27;s Betsy Wallace, who awarded the show four out of five stars, wrote: &quot;the cast is stellar and plotlines shed light on universal human insecurities, such as doubting that your spouse still finds you attractive as you grow older.&quot; Plugged In (publication) said in their review, &quot;Seven years and a mantle full of Emmys later, Raymond is still smartly scripted, now with new characters added to a maturing, expanding family.&quot;

Reviews named Garrett the show&#x27;s &quot;secret weapon&quot; and responsible for &quot;the bulk of the show&#x27;s comic high points.&quot;

===Accolades===
During its nine seasons, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; was nominated for 69 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning 15 of them, including 10 for acting. The series was also nominated for 21 Screen Actors Guild Awards (1 win) and won the Writers Guild of America Award for Episodic Comedy for &quot;Italy&quot; in 2002.

===American television ratings===
:&quot;Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps. All times mentioned in this section were Eastern &amp; Pacific&quot;

The series finale scored a 20.2/29 rating/share, 32.94 million viewers and an 11.2/26 rating/share among adults 18–49. At 8pm, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond: The Last Laugh&quot; scored a 15.3/24 rating/share, 24.52 million viewers and a 7.5/21 rating/share among adults 18–49. Throughout the latter six seasons of the show, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; maintained its position on the top ten rankings.

<doc id="195929" wikidata="Q788351" url="?curid=195929" title="Maladroit">
<text>Maladroit is the fourth studio album by American rock band Weezer, released on May 14, 2002, by Geffen Records. It was self-produced by the band, and was their first album to feature bassist Scott Shriner, following the departure of former bassist Mikey Welsh in 2001, although Shriner was featured in the music video for &quot;Photograph&quot; from the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Weezer&quot; (also known as the &quot;Green Album&quot;). Musically, the album features a hard-rock sound and heavy metal riffs uncommon to Weezer&#x27;s previous releases.

During the recording, Weezer would release demos every day on the band&#x27;s website in an attempt to collect feedback from fans, although guitarist and vocalist Rivers Cuomo would often disagree with fans on most aspects of the album. The band&#x27;s uploading also resulted in some radio stations playing the still unreleased songs.

Supported by the singles &quot;Dope Nose&quot; and &quot;Keep Fishin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Maladroit&quot; received positive reviews from critics and was ranked number 90 in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll of top albums. The album debuted and peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 152,000 copies its first week. As of 2022, the album has sold 605,000 copies in the United States and was certified Gold by the RIAA a month after its release.

==Background and recording==
For the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, Weezer attempted to incorporate an innovative system in which the group would release demos in MP3 format on the band&#x27;s website every day while in the studio working on &quot;Maladroit&quot;. This resulted in dozens of different versions of over thirty different songs circulating on the Internet before the album was released.

The idea was to keep communication open with the band&#x27;s fan base on the group&#x27;s official message board as well as, more crucially, on unofficial message boards such as the Rivers Correspondent Board (which was closed to the public at frontman Rivers Cuomo&#x27;s request, chiefly so that members of the press could not gain access). Yet Cuomo and the fans strongly disagreed on a number of creative aspects of the album. One thing they did agree on was bringing back the summer 2000 song &quot;Slob&quot; for use on the album. Cuomo commented, &quot;I never would have thought to put the song &quot;Slob&quot; on the record if the fans did not request it.&quot; Bassist Scott Shriner also wanted a hidden track, &quot;Are You Gonna Be?&quot; for the album. Regardless of disagreements, Weezer fans are still &quot;specially thanked&quot; in the album&#x27;s liner notes.

The band&#x27;s uploading of MP3 demos onto its website resulted in some radio stations playing the still unreleased (and sometimes unfinished) songs. Due to a spat between Cuomo and the record label Geffen/Interscope, Weezer self-funded the recordings for &quot;Maladroit&quot; and the label was unaware of the recordings at all until the radio began to play them. It is said that Cuomo was so excited for fans to hear the music he personally mailed copies of 8 out of the 13 songs on &quot;Maladroit&quot; to key radio stations and press outlets. In the week it was leaked to radio stations, the lead single &quot;Dope Nose&quot; reached #25 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart without an official single having been issued.

The airplay resulted in a gag order being issued by Geffen Records in which they requested that Weezer return the master tapes from the &quot;Maladroit&quot; sessions and apologize to each radio station that played the song. The band members resisted, citing that they had funded all the sessions themselves and that apologizing seemed pointless. The fans resisted as well, forming an online group called &quot;Unreleased Weezer for the Masses&quot; that rallied for the release of the album.

The songs &quot;Dope Nose&quot; and &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; (off the &quot;Green Album&quot;) were both written using the same method on the same night, with Cuomo allegedly taking &quot;a bunch of Ritalin and ... like three shots of tequila&quot; and pacing around for a while before writing both songs.

==Title and packaging==
The album title &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;awkward, clumsy, inept&quot;, was suggested by a board member on the Weezer message boards who went by the screen name of Lethe.

The album&#x27;s first 600,000 copies were specifically numbered with the number located on the back of the CD case near the lower right-hand corner.

&quot;Maladroit&quot; was the first Weezer album to be released in the Enhanced CD format, which contained bonus videos including live and studio footage, as well as a video of drummer Patrick Wilson riding a skateboard down stadium ramps.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Maladroit&quot; received generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album four stars, saying that it &quot;retains the high quality of the &quot;Green Album&quot;&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the album an eight out of ten, saying &quot;&quot;Maladroit&quot; keeps it short, keeps it simple, keeps it honest, but also importantly, they keep it coming. Thank Weezer for that.&quot; However, IGN later gave the album a score of five out of ten, and called it a &quot;mixed bag&quot;, stating, &quot;If you want to listen to a terrific Weezer cover band, proceed directly to &quot;Maladroit&quot;. Going by title alone, it&#x27;s exactly as advertised. But, please, in the future, let&#x27;s leave Weezer to their own devices. Ours aren&#x27;t working.&quot;

&quot;Spin&quot; ended up calling it the 6th best album of 2002, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted it as the 8th best of the year. In another &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers poll, it was voted the 90th greatest album of all time.

In June 2009, &quot;Magnet&quot; had an article on the five most overrated and underrated Weezer songs. &quot;All of &quot;Maladroit&quot; was ranked number one on the list of the underrated half, where they comment &quot;Maladroit&quot;, the band’s fourth album, is actually really good: not exactly deep, but it has some really stellar pop songs ... Sure, &quot;Maladroit&quot; never became a cultural touchstone the way the band’s first two albums did, but it deserves more credit than it ever got.&quot;

<doc id="195932" wikidata="Q2570090" url="?curid=195932" title="Backless">
<text>Backless is the sixth solo studio album by Eric Clapton, released in November 1978. Produced by Glyn Johns, and released by RSO Records, &quot;Backless&quot; reached no. 8 on the pop charts. While the single &quot;Promises&quot; only reached no. 37 on the UK Singles Chart, it was a much bigger success in the US, reaching no. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The follow-up single, &quot;Watch Out for Lucy&quot;, was the B-side of &quot;Promises&quot;, but reached no. 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100 on its own merit. Later in 1980 &quot;Tulsa Time&quot; was #30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100 with the 1977 song &quot;Cocaine&quot; as B-side. It was Clapton&#x27;s last studio album to feature his longtime bassist Carl Radle, who died in 1980.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted that &quot;there is none of the old spectacular playing—the emphasis is definitely on mellow funkiness—but the duet he plays on &#x27;Roll It&#x27; with singer Marci Levy has some eloquent licks all the same.&quot;

<doc id="195933" wikidata="Q761298" url="?curid=195933" title="No Reason to Cry">
<text>No Reason to Cry is the fourth solo studio album by Eric Clapton, released by RSO Records on 27 August 1976. The album was recorded in Malibu and Los Angeles between December 1975 to May 1976. The record went silver in the U.K.

==Recording==
The album was recorded at The Band&#x27;s Shangri-la Studios in March 1976, and included involvement from all five members of The Band; Rick Danko shared vocals with Clapton on &quot;All Our Past Times&quot;, which he co-wrote with Clapton. The album also includes a duet with Bob Dylan on his otherwise unreleased song &quot;Sign Language&quot;. The booklet in Bob Dylan&#x27;s box set &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot; describes his involvement in this album: &quot;Dylan dropped by and was just hanging out, living in a tent at the bottom of the garden. He would sneak into the studio to see what was going on.&quot; Dylan offered his new, unrecorded song &quot;Seven Days&quot; to Clapton. Clapton passed on it, but Ron Wood took him up on the offer and released it on his third solo album &quot;Gimme Some Neck&quot;. The song &quot;Innocent Times&quot; is sung by Marcy Levy, who also shared vocals with Clapton on &quot;Hungry&quot;. In the bonus track &quot;Last Night&quot;, added in the 1990 re-release, Clapton shares vocals with Richard Manuel.

==Chart performance==
&quot;No Reason to Cry&quot; is one of Clapton&#x27;s most internationally successful albums from the 1970s. The release reached the Top 30 in seven national music album charts, hitting Top 10 in United Kingdom (peaking at No. 8) and in the Netherlands, where it topped out No. 9. The album was certified silver in the United Kingdom. In Norway and the United States, the album charted at No. 13 and No. 15 respectively, while in New Zealand and Sweden, it reached No. 18 and No. 24 respectively.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann awarded the release 3.5 of five possible stars, writing: &quot;&quot;No Reason to Cry&quot; is identifiable as the kind of pop/rock Clapton had been making since the start of his solo career&quot;, adding &quot;the most memorable music on the album occurs when Clapton is collaborating with members of the Band and other guests&quot;. Finishing his review, Ruhlmann called the release &quot;a good purchase for fans of Bob Dylan and the Band, but not necessarily for those of Eric Clapton&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Dave Marsh finds, the album recordings are &quot;much more mélange than masterpiece&quot;. Robert Christgau rated the album with a &quot;B−&quot; and calls the album &quot;a well-made, rather likable rock and roll LP&quot;, noting the &quot;singing is eloquent and the instrumental signature an almost irresistible pleasure&quot;.

<doc id="195938" wikidata="Q549602" url="?curid=195938" title="Slowhand">
<text>Slowhand is the fifth solo studio album by Eric Clapton. Released on 25 November 1977 by RSO Records, and titled after Clapton&#x27;s nickname, it is one of his most commercially and critically successful studio albums. &quot;Slowhand&quot; produced the two hit singles &quot;Lay Down Sally&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot;, reached various international music charts and was honoured with numerous awards and recording certifications. In 2012, a deluxe edition was released to celebrate the album&#x27;s 35th anniversary.

==Recording==
Clapton wanted to work with record producer Glyn Johns as he thought Johns had produced great work with famous groups like the Rolling Stones and Eagles and understood how to work with both British and American musicians. While in the studio with Johns, Clapton noted that the A-list producer was very disciplined and disliked jamming because it would kill important recording time. Although Clapton and his band were intoxicated nearly all the time when recording, Johns liked Clapton&#x27;s work and brought out the best in every musician, according to Clapton.

==Title and artwork==
The album was titled after Clapton&#x27;s nickname, which was given to him by Giorgio Gomelsky. In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton recalled that the name &quot;Slowhand&quot; seemed to be hanging on to his real name, because it seemed to be well received by both his American friends and fans who think of the Wild West when hearing the nickname. The album&#x27;s artwork was done by Clapton himself with the help of Pattie Boyd and Dave Stewart, credited as &quot;El &amp; Nell Ink&quot;. Besides choosing various photos for the inner side of the gramophone record packaging are two pictures, Clapton notes, which have deeper importance to him: one picture, in which he kisses Boyd and another photograph showing a demolished Ferrari 365 GT4 BB, which Clapton bought after seeing George Harrison turning up with the same model at his Hurtwood Edge Estate. The car, which had been involved with Clapton in a car accident after he finished touring in Australia, nearly killed him.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Slowhand&quot; was released on 25 November 1977 by RSO Records. In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, John Swenson found Clapton&#x27;s playing more subtle than before but his songs sobering and interesting psychologically, especially &quot;Next Time You See Her&quot;, as they showed him &quot;in touch with the horrible moral power and long-suffering self-righteousness that is the essence of the blues&quot;. Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, feeling Clapton had regressed as a singer, &quot;sounding like he&#x27;s blown his voice. Doing what, I wonder.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the confident, virtuosic quality in the band&#x27;s playing and the diversity of the songwriting made &quot;Slowhand&quot; &quot;rank with &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; as Eric Clapton&#x27;s best albums&quot;. Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Dave DiMartino said the record was full of hits and &quot;tasteful&quot; music. In 2003, &quot;Slowhand&quot; was ranked number 325 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and again in 2012.

===Deluxe Edition===
In November 2012, a remastered two-compact-disc 35th anniversary deluxe edition of &quot;Slowhand&quot; was released. The first disc consists of the remastered album with additional bonus tracks, outtakes and studio jam sessions. The second disc features a previously unreleased live concert, recorded in April 1977 at the Hammersmith Odeon; although the concert is of the same era as the &quot;Slowhand&quot; sessions, it was performed prior to the album&#x27;s recording and release, and so does not include any of the album&#x27;s tracks.

<text>Anaerobic glycolysis is the transformation of glucose to lactate when limited amounts of oxygen (O2) are available. This occurs in health as in exercising and in disease as in sepsis and hemorrhagic shock. providing energy for a period ranging from 10 seconds to 2 minutes. During this time it can augment the energy produced by aerobic metabolism but is limited by the buildup of lactate. Rest eventually becomes necessary. The anaerobic glycolysis (lactic acid) system is dominant from about 10–30 seconds during a maximal effort. It produces 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, or about 5% of glucose&#x27;s energy potential (38 ATP molecules). The speed at which ATP is produced is about 100 times that of oxidative phosphorylation.

Anaerobic glycolysis is thought to have been the primary means of energy production in earlier organisms before oxygen was at high concentration in the atmosphere and thus would represent a more ancient form of energy production in cells.

In mammals, lactate can be transformed by the liver back into glucose using the Cori cycle.

Fates of pyruvate under anaerobic conditions:

# Pyruvate is the terminal electron acceptor in lactic acid fermentation.When sufficient oxygen is not present in the muscle cells for further oxidation of pyruvate and NADH produced in glycolysis, NAD+ is regenerated from NADH by reduction of pyruvate to lactate. Lactate is converted to pyruvate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. The standard free energy change of the reaction is -25.1 kJ/mol.
# Ethanol fermentationYeast and other anaerobic microorganisms convert glucose to ethanol and rather than pyruvate. Pyruvate is first converted to acetaldehyde by enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase in the presence of Thiamine pyrophosphate and Mg++. Carbon-dioxide is released during this reaction. Acetaldehyde is then converted to ethanol by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. NADH is oxidized to NAD+ during this reaction.

<text>Emily FitzGerald, Duchess of Leinster (6 October 1731 – 27 March 1814), known before 1747 as Lady Emily Lennox, from 1747 to 1761 as The Countess of Kildare and from 1761 to 1766 as The Marchioness of Kildare, was the second of the famous Lennox sisters, daughters of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond (who was illegitimately descended from King Charles II of England and one of his mistresses).

==Early life==
Lady Emily married James FitzGerald, 20th Earl of Kildare, on 7 February 1747. After their wedding in London, the couple returned to Fitzgerald&#x27;s native Ireland, first residing at Leinster House then Carton House.

Their marriage was reportedly a happy one, despite Lord Kildare&#x27;s infidelities. Emily was almost always pregnant, giving birth to nineteen children in just twenty-five years, but only ten lived to mature adulthood:
*George FitzGerald, Earl of Offaly (15 January 1748 – Richmond House, 26 September 1765) died at the age of seventeen.
*William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster (12 March 1749 – 20 October 1804) married Hon. Emilia St. George (daughter of St George Saint-George, 1st Baron St George) on 4 November 1775. They had nine children. 
*Lady Caroline FitzGerald (21 June 1750 – 13 April 1754) died at the age of three. 
*Lady Emily Mary FitzGerald (15 March 1751 – 8 April 1818) married Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont on 20 August 1774. They had five children. 
*Lady Henrietta FitzGerald (9 December 1753 – 10 September 1763) died the age of nine. 
*Lady Caroline FitzGerald (born and died April 1755)
*Charles FitzGerald, 1st Baron Lecale (30 June 1756 – 30 June 1810) married twice and had two illegitimate children. 
*Lady Charlotte Mary Gertrude FitzGerald (29 May 1758 – 13 September 1836) married Joseph Strutt on 23 February 1789. They had four children.
*Lady Louisa Bridget FitzGerald (19 June 1760 – January 1765) died at the age of four. 
*Lord Henry FitzGerald (30 July 1761 – 8 July 1829) married Charlotte Boyle-Walsingham on 3 August 1791. They had thirteen children. 
*Lady Sophia Sarah Mary FitzGerald (26 September 1762 – 21 March 1845).
*Lord Edward FitzGerald (15 October 1763 – 4 June 1798) married Stéphanie Caroline Anne Syms on 27 December 1792. They had three children.
*Lord Robert Stephen FitzGerald (1765 – 2 January 1833), a diplomat; married Sophia Charlotte Fielding and had issue.
*Lord Gerald FitzGerald (January 1766 – 1788). Drowned, went down with the ship in which he was serving.
*Lord Augustus FitzGerald (15 January 1767 – 2 January 1771) died at the age of three. 
*Lady Fanny FitzGerald (28 January 1770 – 1775) died at the age of five.
*Lady Lucy Anne FitzGerald (5 February 1771 – 1851) married Admiral Sir Thomas Foley on 31 July 1802.
*Lady Louisa FitzGerald (1772 – 1776) died at the age of four.
*Lord George Simon FitzGerald (16 April 1773 – May 1783) died at the age of ten. Recognized as a son of Lord Kildare, but in fact was the biological child of the Fitzgerald children&#x27;s tutor, William Ogilvie.

Lord Kildare was created successively Marquess of Kildare and Duke of Leinster in recognition of his contribution to the political life of his country. It was partly the Duke&#x27;s influence that led to a rift between the Duchess and her eldest sister, Caroline Fox, 1st Baroness Holland.

==Later life==

After the death of Lord Kildare on 19 November 1773, Emily married her children&#x27;s tutor, William Ogilvie, on 26 August 1774. Emily and Ogilvie had begun an affair some years earlier in Frescati House. Despite her remarriage, she continued to be known as The Dowager Duchess of Leinster.

Ogilvie was nine years her junior, and was the natural father of her youngest son from her first marriage. They lived for part of their marriage at Ardglass Castle in Ardglass, County Down, where Ogilvie worked to develop the village. A further three children were born to them after their marriage, two of whom lived to adulthood:

*Cecilia Margaret Ogilvie (9 July 1775 – 1824) married Charles Lock on 12 July 1795; they had three daughters.
*Charlotte Ogilvie (born and died 1777)
*Emily Charlotte &quot;Mimie&quot; Ogilvie (May 1778 – 22 January 1832) married Charles George Beauclerk (son of Topham Beauclerk and Lady Diana Spencer; briefly an MP) on 29 April 1799; they had thirteen children.

Emily was treated generously in her first husband&#x27;s will. He left her a jointure of 4,000 annually (increased from the £3,000 promised in the settlement), and a life interest in Leinster House (Dublin) and Carton (which she exchanged for Frescati House and £40,000) together with all their contents. She had brought the usual ducal daughter&#x27;s dowry of £10,000, so the jointure and other payments would financially cripple her son, the second Duke of Leinster.

The first Duke also made over-generous provisions for his younger sons and all his daughters. Emily also received the usual annuity of £400 annually for each of the minor children who lived with her, even after her remarriage to Ogilvie.

Thus, Emily and William Ogilvie were probably financially better off than her son, the second Duke, who existed on less than £7,000 annually, out of which he had to run two large houses, play a role in Irish politics, and also provide lavish dowries of £10,000 each for three sisters who married. He also had to pay huge annuities (£2,000 each) to his two younger brothers Lord Lecale and Lord Henry Fitzgerald, and to pay his youngest brothers £10,000 each at their majority. Since Emily lived to 1814 (outliving the second Duke by ten years), all these generous testamentary provisions, along with the huge building costs incurred by the first Duke, crippled the Leinsters for generations.

Fourteen of her children predeceased her, ten of whom died in childhood or adolescence. All these bereavements caused much pain to Emily, who always remained until the end at the bedside of her children, except to faint from the suffering of seeing them die in her arms. One of her sons, Lord Edward FitzGerald, was a major figure in the republican movement, and was killed during the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

She died on 27 March 1814 in Grosvenor Square, London.

==Popular culture==
In 1999, Irish Screen, BBC America and WGBH produced &quot;Aristocrats&quot;, a six-part limited television series based on the lives of Emily Lennox and her sisters. Geraldine Somerville and Siân Phillips portray Emily as a young woman and as an older woman, respectively.

The series aired in the US on PBS stations under the aegis of the anthology series &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot;; in the UK it aired on the BBC. The series was based on Stella Tillyard&#x27;s 1994 biography, &quot;Aristocrats: Caroline, Emily, Louisa and Sarah Lennox 1740-1832.&quot;

<text>Lord Edward FitzGerald (15 October 1763 – 4 June 1798) was an Irish aristocrat and nationalist. He served part-time in the British Army from 1779 to 1792, having been relieved of his commission for his political activity disloyal to Britain in November of that year. He saw active combat briefly during the American War of Independence, and served at the British garrison in New Brunswick, Canada for several months in 1788. From 1783-97 he served as Member of Parliament for the borough of Athy (Kildare) in the Irish House of Commons. On his return from North America in 1790 he became enthusiastic about the French Revolution and began to mingle with the followers of Thomas Paine, and followed Paine to France after the pamphleteer&#x27;s was exiled and offered citizenship by the revolutionary government of France. Although outspoken about his enthusiasm for the cause of Irish freedom, he remained aloof from the Society of United Irishmen until 1796, when he began secretly agitating for a French-assisted insurrection in Ireland with himself at military leader. On the eve of the intended uprising in May 1798, his hiding place was discovered and he fatally wounded his arresting officer. His resistance was met with gunshot to the shoulder, which was untreated until he developed lockjaw and died in Newgate prison before being tried in court. 

==Early years==
FitzGerald, the fifth son of the 1st Duke of Leinster and the Lady Emily Lennox (daughter of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond), was born at Carton House, near Dublin, and was a member of the Fitzgerald dynasty. In 1773 his father died and his mother soon afterwards married William Ogilvie, who had been the tutor for him and his siblings. He spent most of his childhood in Frescati House at Blackrock in Dublin where he was tutored by Ogilvie in a manner chiefly directed to the acquisition of knowledge that would fit him for a military career.

==American War of Independence==
FitzGerald joined the British Army in 1779 and then became aide-de-camp on the staff of Lord Rawdon in the southern theatre of the American Revolutionary War. He was wounded in the leg at the Battle of Eutaw Springs on 8 September 1781, and was carried off the field by an escaped slave named Tony Small (see Black Loyalist). Small was a free man at the end of the war, and Lord Edward employed him from then on, and the two travelled together back to Europe. FitzGerald was evacuated from Charleston, South Carolina in 1782 when the British forces abandoned the city. Webb surmises that the success of the American colonists in fighting against regular troops led him in later years to the conviction that his countrymen in Ireland could cope with them with a similar result.

In 1783, he visited the West Indies, before returning to Ireland where, in the autumn of that year, his brother William, the 2nd Duke of Leinster, had procured Edward&#x27;s election to the Irish Parliament as a Member for Athy. He held the seat, as a supporter of Henry Grattan&#x27;s Patriot opposition, until 1790 (when he was replaced by his brother Henry). 

==Explorer in the New World==
In the spring of 1786, Fitzgerald took the then unusual step for a young nobleman of entering the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, after which he made a tour through Spain in 1787. Dejected, in England, by unrequited love for his cousin Georgina Lennox (who later married the 3rd Earl Bathurst), accompanied by Small in 1788 he joined the 54th Regiment in Halifax, Nova Scotia, then a resettlement site for thousands of free ‘loyalist’ blacks, before proceeding to the garrison in New Brunswick. 

During their eighteen months in North America, Fitzgerald and Small, guided by a compass, traversed the country from Fredericton, New Brunswick to Quebec, crossed Upper Canada to Detroit, where Fitzgerald was honoured with some kind of honorary affiliation (not strictly adopted as has been claimed) given the name &quot;Eghnidal&quot;, by the chief of the Bear clan of the Kanien&#x27;kehá:ka (Mohawk), Karonghyontye (Captain David Hill), and made his way down the Mississippi to New Orleans, whence they returned to England. Of the frontier society he encountered, Fitzgerald commented: &quot;The equality of everybody and their manner of life I like very much. There are no gentlemen, everybody is on a footing&quot;.

==Re-enters politics==
In 1790, Fitzgerald turned down the command of an expedition against Cadiz offered him by Pitt, observing that the promotion would require him to vote in Parliament with the government and against his convictions. Instead, replaced by his brother Henry as MP for Athy, he was returned to the Irish House of Commons from County Kildare, frequently returning to visit family in England where he entered into intimate terms with his first cousin Charles Fox, with Richard Sheridan and other leading Whigs.

His Whig connections, together with his transatlantic experiences, predisposed Fitzgerald to sympathise with the doctrines of the French Revolution, which he embraced enthusiastically when he visited Paris in October 1792. He lodged with Thomas Paine and listened to the debates in the Convention. At a convivial gathering on 18 November, he supported a toast to &quot;the speedy abolition of all hereditary titles and feudal distinctions&quot;, and gave proof of his zeal by expressly repudiating his own title, a performance for which he was dismissed from the army.

==Marries on the Continent==
According to Thomas Moore, Lord Edward FitzGerald was the only one of the numerous suitors of Sheridan&#x27;s first wife, Elizabeth, whose attentions were received with favour; and it is certain that, whatever may have been its limits, a warm mutual affection subsisted between the two. She conceived a child by him, a baby girl who was born on 30 March 1792(died October 1793).

While in Paris, FitzGerald became enamoured of a young girl whom he chanced to see at the theatre, and who is said to have had a striking likeness to Elizabeth Sheridan. He discovered her to be a protégée of Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis (Madame de Genlis, also known by her other titles as Madame de Sillery and after the revolution citizeness Brûlart) who had achieved fame as a writer and had been responsible for the education of the children of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The girl, whose name was Ann (Nancy) Sims but was commonly known as Pamela (1773–1831), was commonly believed to be the daughter from a relationship between the duke and Mme de Genlis, but there is some evidence to support the story of Madame de Genlis that Pamela was born in Newfoundland. On 27 December 1792, FitzGerald and Pamela were married at Tournai, one of the witnesses being Louis Philippe, afterwards King of the French; and in January 1793 the couple reached Dublin.

==Return to Ireland==
In 1793, on his return from Paris, Lord Edward fresh from the gallery of the Convention in Paris, returned to his seat in the Irish Parliament and immediately began his attack on government. He was required to apologise at the bar of the House of Commons for denouncing a Government proclamation which Grattan had approved for the suppression of the United-Irish attempt to revive the Irish Volunteer movement as a French-model &quot;National Guard&quot;. However, it was not until 1796 that he joined the United Irishmen, who by now had given up as hopeless the path of constitutional reform and whose aim, after the recall of Lord FitzWilliam in 1795, was nothing less than the establishment of an independent Irish republic.

==Revolutionary activities==
In May 1796, while Theobald Wolfe Tone was in Paris endeavouring to obtain French assistance for an insurrection in Ireland, FitzGerald and his friend Arthur O&#x27;Connor proceeded to Hamburg, where they opened negotiations with the Directory through Reinhard, French minister to the Hanseatic towns. The Duke of York, meeting Pamela at Devonshire House on her way through London with her husband, had told her that &quot;all was known&quot; about his plans, and advised her to persuade him not to go abroad. Also, in Hamburg Lord Edward met with Johan Anders Jägerhorn (or baron de Spurila, as he called himself), a Finnish Swede who had advocated Finnish autonomy and now acted as an intermediary between Lord Edward and the French.

The proceedings of the conspirators at Hamburg were made known to the government in London by an informer, Samuel Turner. The result of the Hamburg negotiations was Hoche&#x27;s abortive expedition to Bantry Bay in December 1796.

In September 1797 the Government learnt from the informer Leonard McNally that Lord Edward was among those directing the conspiracy of the United Irishmen, which was now quickly maturing. He was especially concerned with the military organisation, in which he held the post of colonel of the Kildare regiment and head of the military committee. He had papers showing that men were ready to rise. They possessed some arms, but the supply was insufficient, and the leaders were hoping for a French invasion to make good the deficiency and to give support to a popular uprising. But French help proving dilatory and uncertain, the rebel leaders in Ireland were divided in opinion as to the expediency of taking the field without waiting for foreign aid. Lord Edward was among the advocates of the bolder course and there is some evidence that he favoured a project for the massacre of the Irish peers while in procession to the House of Lords for the trial of Lord Kingston in May 1798.

==Net tightens==
It was probably abhorrence of such measures that converted Thomas Reynolds from a conspirator to an informer; at all events, by him and several others, the authorities were kept posted on what was going on, though lack of evidence produced in court delayed the arrest of the ringleaders. But on 12 March 1798 Reynolds&#x27; information led to the seizure of a number of conspirators at the house of Oliver Bond. Lord Edward FitzGerald, warned by Reynolds, was not among them.

As a fellow member of the Ascendancy class, the Government were anxious to make an exception for FitzGerald, avoiding the embarrassing and dangerous consequences of his subversive activities. They communicated their willingness to spare him from the normal fate meted out to traitors. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Clare, said to a member of his family, &quot;For God&#x27;s sake get this young man out of the country; the ports shall be thrown open, and no hindrance whatever offered&quot;.

FitzGerald, however, refused to desert others who could not escape, and whom he had himself led into danger. On 30 March the government proclamation of martial law authorising the military to act as they saw fit to crush the United Irishmen led to a campaign of vicious brutality in several parts of the country. This forced the United Irish executive to bring forward plans for the rising, with or without French aid.

==Arrest and death==

Lord Edward FitzGerald&#x27;s social position made him the most important United Irish leader still at liberty. On 9 May a reward of £1,000 was offered by Dublin Castle for his apprehension. Since the arrests at Bond&#x27;s, FitzGerald had been in hiding, but had twice visited his wife in disguise and was himself visited by his stepfather Ogilvie and his friend William Lawless; he generally observed less caution than his situation required. Meanwhile, the date for the rising was finally fixed for 23 May and FitzGerald awaited the day hidden by Mary Moore above her family&#x27;s inn in Thomas Street Dublin.

Tipped off that the house was going to be raided, Moore turned to Francis Magan, a Catholic barrister and trusted sympathiser, who agreed to hide Fitzgerald. Making their way to Magan&#x27;s on 18 May, Fitzgerald&#x27;s party was challenged by Major Henry Sirr and a company of Dumbarton Fencibles. Moore escaped with Fitzgerald (William Putnam McCabe and other of his bodyguard were arrested) and took him back to Thomas Street to the house of Nicholas Murphy.

Moore explained to Magan what had happened and, unbeknownst to her, Magan informed Dublin Castle. The Moores were raided that day. Mary, running to warn the Leinster Directory meeting nearby in James&#x27;s Gate, received a bayonet cut across the shoulders.

That same evening Sirr stormed Murphy&#x27;s house where Lord Edward was in bed suffering from a fever. Alerted by the commotion, FitzGerald jumped out of bed and, ignoring the pleas of the arresting officers Captain William Bellingham Swan (later assistant town Major of Dublin) and Captain Daniel Frederick Ryan to surrender peacefully, FitzGerald stabbed Swan and mortally wounded Ryan with a dagger in a desperate attempt to escape. He was secured only after Major Sirr shot him in the shoulder.

After a brief detention in Dublin Castle he was taken to Newgate Prison, Dublin where his wound, which had become infected, became mortally inflamed. His wife, whom the government probably had enough evidence to convict of treason, had fled the country, never to see her husband again, but Lord Edward&#x27;s brother Henry and his aunt Lady Louisa Conolly were allowed to see him in his last moments. Lord Edward died at the age of 34 on 4 June 1798 as the rebellion raged outside. He was buried the next day in the crypt of St Werburgh&#x27;s Church, Dublin. An Act of Attainder confiscating his property was passed as 38 Geo. 3 c. 77, but was eventually repealed in 1819.

The weapon used by Lord Edward to attack Captains Swan and Ryan while trying to escape arrest was later stolen from Major Swan&#x27;s house by Emma Lucretia Dobbin, the daughter of Rev. William Dobbin and Catherine Coote. The scabbard he reputedly had at his arrest is held at Limerick Museum.

==Character assessment==
There is eveidence that, shortly after his death, Fitzgerald&#x27;s sister, Lady Lucy FitzGerald, intended to publish a statement. The following was found among her papers but there is no evidence that it was ever printed:
Fitzgerald was of small stature and handsome features. In the opinion of the McNeill biography in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; eleventh edition (1911) Fitzgerald&#x27;s character and career have been made the subject of eulogies much beyond their merits.

The same writer claims:

This opinion is not that held in Ireland, where Fitzgerald is remembered as brave and sweet-natured, a clever planner, and a tragic loss. His funeral is described:

==Family==
Apart from the daughter born to him by Elizabeth Sheridan in 1792, Lord Edward FitzGerald had the following children with his wife Pamela:

* Edward Fox FitzGerald (10 October 1794 – 25 January 1863) who married on 6 November 1827 to Jane Paul (died 2 November 1891)
* Pamela FitzGerald (1795/1796 - 25 November 1869), married on 21 November 1820 Sir Guy Campbell, 1st Baronet (died 26 January 1849)
* Lucy Louisa FitzGerald (1798 - September 1826), married on 5 September 1825 Capt. George Francis Lyon (died 8 October 1832).

==Memorials==
There are Lord Edward Streets named in his honour in many places in Ireland, such as Dublin, Limerick, Sligo, Kilkenny, Ballina, Ballymote, and Ballycullenbeg in County Laois.

===Sporting associations===
The County Roscommon GAA club Tulsk Lord Edward&#x27;s is named after Fitzgerald. The Geraldines P. Moran GAA club in Cornelscourt in Dublin is also partly named after him.

<doc id="195942" wikidata="Q582096" url="?curid=195942" title="Journeyman">
<text>A journeyman is a worker, skilled in a given building trade or craft, who has successfully completed an official apprenticeship qualification. Journeymen are considered competent and authorized to work in that field as a fully qualified employee. They earn their license by education, supervised experience and examination. Although journeymen have completed a trade certificate and are allowed to work as employees, they may not yet work as self-employed master craftsmen.

The term &quot;journeyman&quot; was originally used in the medieval trade guilds. Journeymen were paid daily and the word &quot;journey&quot; is derived from &quot;journée&quot;, meaning &quot;whole day&quot; in French. Each individual guild generally recognised three ranks of workers: apprentices, journeymen, and masters. A journeyman, as a qualified tradesman, could become a master and run their own business, but most continued working as employees.

Guidelines were put in place to promote responsible tradesmen, who were held accountable for their own work and to protect the individual trade and the general public from unskilled workers. To become a master, a journeyman has to submit a master piece of work to a guild for evaluation. Only after evaluation can a journeyman be admitted to the guild as a master. Sometimes, a journeyman was required to accomplish a three-year working trip, which may be called the journeyman years.

==Origin==

The word &quot;journey&quot; comes from the French &quot;journée&quot; (day), which in turn comes from the Latin &quot;diurnus&quot; (pertaining to a day, daily). The title &quot;journeyman&quot; refers to the right to charge a fee for each day&#x27;s work. A journeyman has completed an apprenticeship but is employed by another such as a master craftsman, but they would live apart and might have a family of their own. A journeyman could not employ others. In contrast, an apprentice would be bound to a master, usually for a fixed term of seven years, and lived with the master as a member of the household, receiving most or all compensation in the form of food, lodging, and training.

In parts of Europe, as in Late Medieval Germany, spending time as a wandering journeyman (&quot;Wandergeselle&quot;), moving from one town to another to gain experience of different workshops, was an important part of the training of an aspirant master. Carpenters and other artisans in German-speaking countries have retained the tradition of traveling journeymen even today, but only a few still practice it. In France, journeymen were known as compagnons.

==Modern era==

In modern apprenticeship systems, a journeyman has a trades certificate to show the required completion of an apprenticeship. In many countries, it is the highest formal rank, as that of master has been eliminated, and they may perform all tasks of the trade in the area certified as well as supervise apprentices and become self-employed.

The modern apprenticeship system aims to build skills by on-the-job training. An apprentice is able to earn a living while learning new skills. The working environment is closely linked to the employer, giving the individual company the opportunity to shape the apprentice, within the guidelines, to suit particular requirements. Quite often, a strong working relationship is built between employee and employer.

In Germany, however, master craftsmen, after they complete their apprenticeships, are required to take part-time courses that last three to four years or full-time courses that last one year.

===United States===

In the United States, employment in some building trades, such as an electrician, carpenter, plumber, machinist, and HVAC mechanic, usually requires holding state or local (city or county) license as a journeyman or master.
The license certifies that the craftsman has met the requirements of time in the field (usually a minimum of 8,000 hours) and time in an approved classroom setting (usually 700 hours). A journeyman has the responsibility of supervising workers of lesser experience and training them and has the qualifications (knowledge and skills) to work unsupervised himself. A journeyman is commonly expected to have a wide range of experience, covering most fields of their trade. For example, a non-journeyman worker of some 20 or 30 years&#x27; experience may have most or all of their experience in only residential, commercial, or industrial applications. A journeyman, however, has a broad field of experience in residential, commercial, and industrial applications.

===Australia===
In Australia, a journeyman registration allows the permit holder to work under the general direction of an advanced tradesman. A journeyman may oversee the work of apprentices and trades assistants but may not contract for work using that particular registration. A journeyman level qualification is obtained by completing a formal apprenticeship. An apprenticeship is learning a skilled trade under the supervision of an advanced tradesperson. An apprentice is a trainee who is becoming formally trained and qualified in a particular type of trade. The duration of an apprenticeship is usually three to four years, depending on the individual trade. On completion of the training the apprentice will receive a nationally recognised qualification, a trade certificate. Practical on-the-job learning makes up the majority of an apprenticeship, but it also incorporates some classroom learning. As of 2016 apprenticeships offered real-life experience in the workplace, a regular income and new skills. Examples of licensed trades are plumbers and , electricians, air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics and carpenters and joiners.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand the Journeyman class recognizes that a person has had formal training in a trade and allows them to register and be licensed as a journeyman in that trade. While they are considered fully trained, their level of skill is considered intermediate. A journeyman is required to work under supervision from a fully qualified tradesman. An apprentice is eligible for Journeyman registration after they have completed the New Zealand National Certificate (Level 4) in Plumbing, Gasfitting or Drainlaying but haven’t yet passed the relevant registration theory examination. A candidate must apply formally to the Plumbers, Gasfitters
and Drainlayers Board. A journeyman cannot be a business owner or manage employees but is expected to do service calls in coordination with and at the behest of the master tradesman. They may also work independently when their skill level permits.

===Canada===
In Canada, in addition to completion of Apprenticeship in a Skilled Trade, the worker may also choose to write an exam to be recognized throughout the country via the Interprovincial Standards Red Seal Program.

==Modern journeyman==
The &quot;modern journeyman&quot; is a term for the many paths of adult education and can be used to describe life&#x27;s process of continual learning. Although the term &quot;journeyman&quot; is typically traditional, &quot;modern journeyman&quot; is also used to refer to current concepts of adult education: &quot;life-long learning&quot;, &quot;up-skilling&quot;, &quot;the knowledge wave&quot; and &quot;modern apprenticeships&quot;.

In American English, a journeyman is an athlete who is technically competent but unable to excel. The term is used elsewhere, such as in British and Australian English, to refer to a professional sportsman who plays for numerous clubs during their career without becoming a staple of any one club.

<doc id="195945" wikidata="Q1659714" url="?curid=195945" title="A Canticle for Leibowitz">
<text>A Canticle for Leibowitz is a post-apocalyptic social science fiction novel by American writer Walter M. Miller Jr., first published in 1959. Set in a Catholic monastery in the desert of the southwestern United States after a devastating nuclear war, the book spans thousands of years as civilization rebuilds itself. The monks of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz preserve the surviving remnants of man&#x27;s scientific knowledge until the world is again ready for it.

The novel is a fix-up of three short stories Miller published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; that were inspired by the author&#x27;s participation in the bombing of the monastery at the Battle of Monte Cassino during World War II. The book is considered one of the classics of science fiction and has never been out of print. It won the 1961 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel, and its themes of religion, recurrence, and church versus state have generated a significant body of scholarly research. A sequel, &quot;Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman&quot;, was published posthumously in 1997.

==Publication history==

===Development===
By 1955, Walter M. Miller Jr. had published over 30 science fiction short stories in such magazines as &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;. Significant themes of his stories included loss of scientific knowledge or &quot;socio-technological regression and its presumed antithesis, continued technological advance&quot;, its preservation through oral transmission, the guardianship of archives by priests, and &quot;that side of [human] behavior which can only be termed religious&quot;. These thematic elements, combined with the growing subgenre of the &quot;post-disaster&quot; story and Miller&#x27;s own experiences during World War II, set the stage for the short story that would become the opening section of &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;.

During World War II, Miller served as a radioman and tail gunner in a bomber crew that participated in the destruction of the 6th-century Christian monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy, founded by St. Benedict and recognized as the oldest surviving Christian church in the Western world. This experience impressed him enough to write, a decade later, the short story &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;, about an order of monks whose abbey springs from the destroyed world around it. The story, which would evolve into &quot;Fiat Homo&quot;, the first of three parts of the fix-up novel, was published in the April 1955 edition of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (&quot;F&amp;SF&quot;).

Although not originally intended as a serialization, the saga continued in &quot;And the Light Is Risen&quot;, which was published in August 1956 (also in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;). That work would later grow into &quot;Fiat Lux&quot;, the second part of the novel. It was while writing the third story, &quot;The Last Canticle&quot;, for magazine publication in February of the following year that Miller realized he was really completing a novel: &quot;Only after I had written the first two and was working on the third did it dawn on me that this isn&#x27;t three novelettes, it&#x27;s a novel. And I converted it&quot;.

The publication of the three &quot;Canticle&quot; stories, along with Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Lineman&quot;, in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, marked a significant evolution in the writer&#x27;s craft. Under the editorship of Anthony Boucher, &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; possessed a reputation for publishing works with &quot;careful writing and characterization&quot;. Walker Percy considered the magazine &quot;high-class sci-fi pulp&quot;. The appearance of these stories in the magazine is indicative of the direction Miller&#x27;s writing had taken toward human&#x27; stories, less crowded with incident, more concerned with values&quot;.

&quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; was the only novel Miller published during his lifetime. For the fix-up, Miller did not just collate the three short stories. He changed the title and the names of some characters, added new characters, changed the nature and prominence of existing characters, and added Latin passages. These revisions affected the religious and recurrence themes of the story.

The Latin phrases in the novel relate to Roman Catholic Church practices, rituals and official communications. Susan Olsen writes that Miller did not include the Latin phrases just to &quot;add dignity&quot; to the work, but to emphasize its religious themes, making it consonant with the tradition of Judeo-Christian writings.

Changing the name of the abbot of the first part from &quot;Father Juan&quot; to &quot;Abbot Arkos&quot; strengthened the cyclical/recurrence motif, since the name of the first abbot encountered, &quot;Arkos&quot;, begins with the first letter of the Latin alphabet and the name of the last abbot, &quot;Zerchi&quot;, begins with the last letter. Miller also expanded certain scenes, increasing their importance: for instance, the initial encounter between Brother Francis and Abbot Arkos in &quot;Fiat Homo&quot; grew from two pages in the short story to eight pages in the novel. Abbot Arkos was shown to possess doubts and uncertainty, unlike the dogmatism of Father Juan.

Miller also used the adaptation process to add a layer of complexity to the story. Walker Percy recognized this dimension of the novel, which he compared to a &quot;cipher, a coded message, a book in a strange language&quot;. David Seed deemed the novel &quot;charged with half-concealed meaning&quot;, an intricacy that seems to have been added as Miller was revising the stories for publication as a novel. Decoding messages such as this is an important activity in Miller&#x27;s works, both in &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; and in his short stories. For example, in the original version of &quot;Fiat Homo&quot;, Miller limits his &quot;wordplay&quot; to an explicit symbolism involving the letter &quot;V&quot; and Brother Francis&#x27; &quot;Voice/Vocation&quot; during Francis&#x27; encounter with the wandering pilgrim. In the novel, however, &quot;Miller reserves such symbolistic cross-references to the more intellectual analysts and builds a comedy of incomprehension around Francis&quot;.

Miller&#x27;s experience in writing for science fiction magazines contributed to his writing of &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;. His background was with the medium lengths of the short story, novelette, and short novel, where he combined character, action, and import. This full-length novel has a tripartite structure: each section is &quot;short novel size, with counterpoint, motifs, and allusions making up for the lack of more ordinary means of continuity&quot;.

===Publication===
&quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; was published by J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. as a hardcover in 1960 with a 1959 copyright, and two reprints appeared within the first year. More than 40 new editions and reprints have appeared for the book, which has never been out of print. It often appears on &quot;best of&quot; lists, and has been recognized three times with Locus Poll Awards for best all-time science fiction novel.

==Plot summary==
===Background===
After 20th-century civilization was destroyed by a global nuclear war, known as the &quot;Flame Deluge&quot;, there was a violent backlash against the culture of advanced knowledge and technology that had led to the development of nuclear weapons. During this backlash, called the &quot;Simplification&quot;, anyone of learning, and eventually anyone who could even read, was likely to be killed by rampaging mobs, who proudly took on the name of &quot;Simpletons&quot;. Illiteracy became almost universal, and books were destroyed en masse.

Isaac Edward Leibowitz, a Jewish electrical engineer working for the United States military, survived the war and sought refuge from the mobs of the &quot;Simplification&quot; in the sanctuary of a Cistercian monastery, all the while surreptitiously searching for his wife, from whom he had become separated in the war. Eventually concluding that his wife was dead, he joined the monastery, took holy orders (becoming a priest), and dedicated his life to preserving knowledge by hiding books, smuggling them to safety (known as &quot;booklegging&quot;), memorizing, and copying them. He approached the Church for permission to found a new monastic order dedicated to this purpose. With permission granted, he founded his new order in the desert of the American Southwest, where it became known as the &quot;Albertian Order of Leibowitz&quot;. The Order&#x27;s abbey is located in a remote desert in New Mexico, possibly near the military base where Leibowitz worked before the war, on an old road that may have been &quot;a portion of the shortest route from the Great Salt Lake to Old El Paso&quot;. Leibowitz was eventually betrayed and martyred. Later beatified by the Roman Catholic Church, he became a candidate for sainthood.

Six hundred years after his death, the abbey still preserves the &quot;Memorabilia&quot;, the collected writings and artifacts of 20th-century civilization that survived the Flame Deluge and the Simplification, in the hope that they will help future generations reclaim forgotten science.

The story is structured in three parts: &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The parts are separated by periods of six centuries each.

=== (&quot;Let There Be Man&quot;)===
In the 26th century, a 17-year-old novice named Brother Francis Gerard of Utah is on a vigil in a New Mexico desert. While searching for a rock to complete a shelter from the desert wolves, Brother Francis encounters a vagrant Wanderer, apparently looking for the abbey, who inscribes Hebrew on a rock that appears to be the perfect fit for the shelter. When Brother Francis picks up the rock, he discovers the entrance to an ancient fallout shelter containing &quot;relics&quot;, such as handwritten notes on crumbling memo pads bearing cryptic texts resembling a 20th-century shopping list. He soon realizes that these notes appear to have been written by Leibowitz, his order&#x27;s founder. The discovery of the ancient documents causes an uproar at the monastery, as the other monks speculate that the relics once belonged to Leibowitz. Brother Francis&#x27;s account of the Wanderer, who ultimately never turned up at the abbey, is also greatly embellished by the other monks amid rumours that he was an apparition of Leibowitz himself; Francis strenuously denies the embellishments, but equally persistently refuses to deny that the encounter occurred, despite the lack of other witnesses. Abbot Arkos, the head of the monastery, worries that the discovery of so many potentially holy relics in such a short period may cause delays in Leibowitz&#x27;s canonization process. Francis is banished back to the desert to complete his vigil and defuse the sensationalism.

Many years later, the abbey is visited by Monsignors Aguerra (God&#x27;s Advocate) and Flaught (the Devil&#x27;s Advocate), the Church&#x27;s investigators in the case for Leibowitz&#x27;s sainthood. Leibowitz is eventually canonized as Saint Leibowitz – based partly on the evidence Francis discovered in the shelter – and Brother Francis is sent to New Rome to represent the Order at the canonization Mass. He brings with him the documents found in the shelter, and an illumination of one of the documents on which he has spent years working, as a gift to the Pope.

En route, he is robbed by &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Children&quot; – an ironic name for outcast genetic mutants who are the descendants of fallout victims – and his illumination is taken, though he negotiates with the robbers to keep the original blueprint on which the illuminated copy was based. The robbers believe the gold-inlaid copy is the original and the blueprint the worthless copy. Francis completes the journey to New Rome and is granted an audience with the Pope. Francis presents the Pope with the remaining blueprint, and the Pope comforts Francis with the notion that the fifteen years he spent creating the illumination were not rendered a waste by the theft, but rather were essential in protecting the original relic. The Pope also aids Francis by giving him gold with which to ransom back the illumination; however, Francis is killed during his return trip by the Pope&#x27;s Children, receiving an arrow between the eyes, just after he spots the approach of the Wanderer in the distance. The Wanderer discovers and buries Francis&#x27;s body. The narrative then focuses on the buzzards who were denied their meal by the burial; they fly over the Great Plains and find much food near the Red River until a city-state, based in Texarkana, rises.

=== (&quot;Let There Be Light&quot;)===

In 3174, the Albertian Order of Saint Leibowitz is still preserving the half-understood knowledge from before the Flame Deluge and the subsequent Age of Simplification. The new Dark Age is ending, however, and a new Renaissance is beginning. Thon Taddeo Pfardentrott, a highly regarded secular scholar, is sent by his cousin Hannegan, Mayor of Texarkana, to the abbey. Thon Taddeo, frequently compared to Galileo, is interested in the Order&#x27;s preserved collection of Memorabilia.

At the abbey, Brother Kornhoer, a talented engineer, has just finished work on a &quot;generator of electrical essences&quot;, a treadmill-powered electrical generator that powers an arc lamp. He gives credit for the generator to work done by Thon Taddeo. Arriving at the monastery, Thon Taddeo immediately recognizes the significance of Brother Kornhoer&#x27;s pioneering work. By studying the Memorabilia, Thon Taddeo makes several major &quot;discoveries&quot;, and asks the abbot to allow the Memorabilia to be removed to Texarkana. The Abbot Dom Paulo refuses, offering to allow Thon Taddeo to continue his research at the abbey instead. Before departing, the Thon comments that it could take decades to finish analyzing the Memorabilia.

The Wanderer, now called Benjamin, has settled down as a hermit within sight of the abbey, and has struck up a relationship with the abbot. Before Thon Taddeo departs, Benjamin visits the abbey to meet the Thon, to see if he is the long-awaited Messiah.

Meanwhile, Hannegan makes an alliance with the kingdom of Laredo and the neighboring, relatively civilized city-states against the threat of attack from nomadic warriors living on the plains. Hannegan, however, is secretly manipulating the regional politics to effectively neutralize all of his enemies, leaving him in control of the entire region. Monsignor Apollo, the papal nuncio to Hannegan&#x27;s court, sends word to New Rome that Hannegan intends to attack the Empire of Denver next, and that he intends to use the abbey as a base of operations from which to conduct the campaign. For his actions, Apollo is executed, and Hannegan initiates a church schism, declaring loyalty to the Pope to be punishable by death. The Church excommunicates Hannegan.

=== (&quot;Thy Will Be Done&quot;)===
In the year 3781, mankind has emerged into a new technological age, and now possesses nuclear energy and weapons again, as well as starships and extrasolar colonies. Two world superpowers, the Asian Coalition and the Atlantic Confederacy, have been embroiled in a cold war for 50 years. The Leibowitzian Order&#x27;s mission of preserving the Memorabilia has expanded to the preservation of all knowledge.

Rumors that both sides are assembling nuclear weapons in space, and that a nuclear weapon has been detonated, increase public and international tensions. At the abbey, the current abbot, Dom Jethras Zerchi, recommends to New Rome that the Church reactivate the (&quot;Whither wanders the flock, the shepherd is with them&quot;), a contingency plan in the case of another global apocalypse which involves &quot;certain (spacefaring) vehicles&quot; the Church has had since 3756. A &quot;nuclear incident&quot; occurs in the Asian Coalition city of Itu Wan: an underground nuclear explosion has destroyed the city, and the Atlantic Confederacy counters by firing a &quot;warning shot&quot; over the South Pacific. Rumors swirl about whether the city&#x27;s devastation was deliberate or accidental.

New Rome tells Zerchi to proceed with , and to plan for departure within three days. He appoints Brother Joshua as mission leader, telling him that the mission is an emergency plan for perpetuating the Church on extrasolar colony planets in the event of a nuclear war on Earth. The Order&#x27;s Memorabilia will also accompany the mission. That night the Atlantic Confederacy launches an assault against Asian Coalition space platforms. The Asian Coalition responds by using a nuclear weapon against the Confederacy capital city of Texarkana, which kills millions of people. A ten-day cease-fire is issued by the World Court. The Wanderer reappears at the rectory, at the last meal before Brother Joshua and the space-trained monks and priests depart on a secret chartered flight for New Rome, hoping to leave Earth on the starship before the cease-fire ends.

During the cease-fire, the abbey offers shelter to refugees fleeing the regions affected by fallout, which results in a battle of wills over the euthanasia of hopelessly irradiated refugees between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp. The war resumes, and a nuclear explosion occurs near the abbey. Abbot Zerchi tries to flee to safety, bringing with him the abbey&#x27;s ciborium containing consecrated hosts, but it is too late. He is trapped by the falling walls of the abbey and finds himself lying under tons of rock and bones as the abbey&#x27;s ancient crypts disgorge their contents. Among them is a skull with an arrow hole in its forehead (presumably that of Brother Francis Gerard from the first section of the book).

As he lies dying under the abbey&#x27;s rubble, Zerchi is startled to encounter Mrs. Grales/Rachel, a tomato peddler and two-headed mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, and appears to be dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, exempt from original sin. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.

After the abbot&#x27;s death, the scene briefly flashes to Joshua and the crew, who are preparing to launch as the nuclear explosions begin. Joshua, the last crew member to board the starship, knocks the dirt from his sandals (a reference to Matthew 10:14, &quot;If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet&quot;), murmuring &quot;&quot; (&quot;Thus passes the world&quot;, a play on the phrase , &quot;thus passes the glory of the world&quot;).

As a coda, a final vignette depicts the ecological aspects of the war: seabirds and fish succumb to the poisonous fallout, and a shark evades death only by moving to particularly deep water, where, it is noted, the shark was &quot;very hungry that season&quot;.

==Major themes==

===Recurrence and cyclical history===

Scholars and critics have noted the theme of cyclic history or recurrence in Miller&#x27;s works, epitomized in &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;. David Seed, in discussing the treatment of nuclear holocaust in science fiction in his book &quot;American Science Fiction and the Cold War: Literature and Film&quot; (1992), states, &quot;it was left to Walter M. Miller&#x27;s &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; to show recurrence taking place in a narrative spanning centuries&quot;. David N. Samuelson, whose 1969 doctoral dissertation is considered the &quot;best overall discussion&quot; of the book, calls the &quot;cyclical theme of technological progress and regress ... the foundation-stone on which &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; is built&quot;.

The story&#x27;s circular structure – and the cyclical history it presents – support a number of thematic and structural elements which unify its three sections. Although the novel&#x27;s events take place in a fictional future, the three parts allegorically represent crucial phases of Western history. The first section, &quot;Fiat Homo&quot;, depicts a Church preserving civilization, a counterpart to the &quot;Age of Faith&quot; after the Fall of Rome. The action of the second part, &quot;Fiat Lux&quot;, focuses on a renaissance of &quot;secular learning&quot;, echoing the &quot;divergences of Church and State and of science and faith&quot;. &quot;Fiat Voluntas Tua&quot;, the final part, is the analog of contemporary civilization, with its &quot;technological marvels, its obsessions with material, worldly power, and its accelerating neglect of faith and the spirit&quot;.

In her analysis of Miller&#x27;s fiction, Rose Secrest connects this theme directly to one of Miller&#x27;s earlier short fiction works, quoting a passage from &quot;The Ties that Bind&quot;, published in the May 1954 edition of &quot;If&quot; magazine: &quot;All societies go through three phases... First there is the struggle to integrate in a hostile environment. Then, after integration, comes an explosive expansion of the culture-conquest... Then a withering of the mother culture, and the rebellious rise of young cultures&quot;.

===Church versus state===

The third part, &quot;Fiat Voluntas Tua&quot;, includes a debate between future Church and state stances on abortion and euthanasia, a thematic issue representative of the larger conflict between Church and state. Literary critic Edward Ducharme claimed that &quot;Miller&#x27;s narrative continually returns to the conflicts between the scientist&#x27;s search for truth and the state&#x27;s power&quot;.

==Literary significance and reception==

Initial response to the novel was mixed, but it drew responses from newspapers and magazines normally inattentive to science fiction. &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; was reviewed in such notable publications as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, and &quot;The Spectator&quot;. While &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was negative – calling Miller a &quot;dull, ashy writer guilty of heavy-weight irony&quot; – &quot;The Spectator&#x27;s&quot; was mixed. Also unimpressed, &quot;Time&quot; said, &quot;Miller proves himself chillingly effective at communicating a kind of post-human lunar landscape of disaster&quot;, but dubbed it intellectually lightweight. The &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;″s Martin Levin, however, hailed the work as an &quot;ingenious fantasy&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the book unusual exposure outside the genre in a front-page review in the &quot;Chicago Tribune Magazine of Books&quot;, reviewer Edmund Fuller calling the book &quot;an extraordinary novel&quot;. Rating it five stars out of five, Floyd C. Gale of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; said that &quot;It has many passages of remarkable power and deserves the widest possible audience&quot;. A decade later, &quot;Time&quot; re-characterized its opinion of the book, calling it &quot;an extraordinary novel even by literary standards, [which] has flourished by word of mouth for a dozen years&quot;. After criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; as among stories &quot;that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical&quot;.

&quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; was an early example of a genre story becoming a mainstream best-seller after large publishers entered the science-fiction market. In 1961 it was awarded the Hugo Award for Best Novel by The World Science Fiction Convention. In the years since, praise for the work has been consistently high. It is considered a &quot;science-fiction classic ... [and] is arguably the best novel written about nuclear apocalypse, surpassing more popularly known books like &quot;On the Beach&quot;&quot;. The book has also generated a significant body of literary criticism, including numerous literature journal articles, books and college courses. Acknowledging its serialization roots, literary critic David N. Samuelson writes that the novel &quot;may be the one universally acknowledged literary masterpiece to emerge from magazine SF&quot;. Fellow critic David Cowart places the novel in the realm of works by Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, and Walker Percy, in 1975 stating it &quot;stands for many readers as the best novel ever written in the genre&quot;. Percy, a National Book Award recipient, declared the book &quot;a mystery: it&#x27;s as if everything came together by some felicitous chance, then fell apart into normal negative entropy. I&#x27;m as mystified as ever and hold &#x27;Canticle&#x27; in even higher esteem&quot;. Scholars and critics have explored the many themes encompassed in the novel, frequently focusing on its motifs of religion, recurrence, and church versus state.

A 15-part full-cast abridged serial of the novel was adapted for radio by John Reeves and broadcast in 1981 by National Public Radio. The serial was directed by Karl Schmidt and was produced by Schmidt with Marv Nonn. Carol Cowan narrated the production.

In 1992, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 90-minute dramatization of the first two parts, &quot;Fiat Homo&quot; and &quot;Fiat Lux&quot;, with Andrew Price as Brother Francis and Michael McKenzie as Dom Paulo. The adaptation was by Donald Campbell and was directed by Hamish Wilson.

A 2012 radio adaptation of &quot;Fiat Homo, Part One of A Canticle For Leibowitz&quot; read by Nigel Lindsay, abridged by Nick McCarty and produced by Philippa Geering for BBC Radio 4 Extra, was broadcast in five 30-minute parts.

==Sequel==

Toward the end of his life, Miller wrote another installment of the Abbey of Saint Leibowitz saga, &quot;Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman&quot;. A full-length novel (455 pages) significantly longer than its predecessor, it is set in AD 3254, eighty years after the events of &quot;Fiat Lux&quot; but several centuries before &quot;Fiat Voluntas Tua&quot;. Suffering from writer&#x27;s block and fearful the new work would go unfinished, Miller arranged with author Terry Bisson to complete it. Bisson said all he did was go in and tie up the loose ends Miller had left. The novel tells the story of Brother Blacktooth St. George of the Leibowitzian abbey who, unlike Brother Francis, wants to be released from his holy vows and leave the abbey. In addition to recounting his travels as Cardinal Brownpony&#x27;s personal secretary, the book describes the political situation in the 33rd century as the Church and the Texark Empire vie for power. Miller died before the novel&#x27;s publication.

&quot;Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman&quot; has been called &quot;Walter Miller&#x27;s other novel&quot;. Reviewer Steven H. Silver points out that this &quot;is not to say that &quot;Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman&quot; does not deserve to be read. It is a fantastic novel, only suffering in comparison to Miller&#x27;s earlier work&quot;.

<doc id="195946" wikidata="Q607979" url="?curid=195946" title="August (album)">
<text>August is the tenth solo studio album by the English rock musician Eric Clapton, released in 1986 by Duck Records/Warner Bros. Records. Described as a &quot;hard R&amp;B&quot; album, it was primarily produced by Phil Collins, in association with longtime Clapton associate Tom Dowd.

==Composition==
The album opens with the Dowd-Clapton produced &quot;It&#x27;s in the Way That You Use It&quot;, co-written with Robbie Robertson, late of The Band. It was featured in the Paul Newman-Tom Cruise film &quot;The Color of Money&quot; in October 1986, a month before the album&#x27;s release, subsequently reaching No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for one week. Two tracks, &quot;Run&quot; and &quot;Hung Up On Your Love&quot;, were written by veteran Motown composer Lamont Dozier while &quot;Tearing Us Apart&quot; was a duet with Tina Turner and &quot;Bad Influence&quot; was a cover of a number by blues musician Robert Cray. &quot;Holy Mother&quot;, co-written with Stephen Bishop, was dedicated to the memory of another member of The Band, Richard Manuel, who had taken his own life earlier that year.

The album&#x27;s only UK top 20 hit, &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;, was recorded at the suggestion of Greg Phillinganes. Legend has it that upon hearing Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s original track, around 1980–82, producer Quincy Jones fell in love with the track, and he and Michael Jackson recorded their own version with new lyrics by Jackson during his &quot;Thriller&quot; sessions. The track never made the &quot;Thriller&quot; album but Phillinganes, at the time keyboard player for Jackson, later released his own version of the song on his 1984 &quot;Pulse&quot; album, which resembles the Clapton version that became &quot;August&quot;&#x27;s lead single in the UK. Jackson&#x27;s version was finally released in 2010 on the posthumous album &quot;Michael&quot;.

Clapton&#x27;s studio band for the album included Collins on drums and backing vocals, bassist Nathan East and keyboard player Greg Phillinganes; saxophonist Michael Brecker, trumpeters Randy Brecker and Jon Faddis, and trombone player Dave Bargeron. Collins, East and Phillinganes would recreate their studio roles for Clapton&#x27;s acclaimed live appearances over the next two years.

Veering between Collins soul/pop and Clapton blues/rock, &quot;August&quot; cemented Clapton&#x27;s comeback.

<text>In mathematics, the composition operator formula_1 takes two functions, formula_2 and formula_3, and returns a new function formula_4. Thus, the function is applied after applying to . formula_5 is pronounced &quot;the composition of and &quot;.

Reverse composition, sometimes denoted formula_6 , applies the operation in the opposite order, applying formula_2 first and formula_3 second. Intuitively, reverse composition is a chaining process in which the output of function feeds the input of function .

The composition of functions is a special case of the composition of relations, sometimes also denoted by formula_1. As a result, all properties of composition of relations are true of composition of functions, such as associativity.

==Examples==

* Composition of functions on a finite set: If , and , then , as shown in the figure.
* Composition of functions on an infinite set: If (where is the set of all real numbers) is given by and is given by , then: 
* If an airplane&#x27;s altitude at time  is , and the air pressure at altitude is , then is the pressure around the plane at time .
* Function defined on finite sets which change the order of their elements such as permutations can be composed on the same set, this being composition of permutations.

==Properties==
The composition of functions is always associative—a property inherited from the composition of relations. That is, if , , and are composable, then . Since the parentheses do not change the result, they are generally omitted.

In a strict sense, the composition is only meaningful if the codomain of equals the domain of ; in a wider sense, it is sufficient that the former be an improper subset of the latter.
Moreover, it is often convenient to tacitly restrict the domain of , such that produces only values in the domain of . For example, the composition of the functions defined by and defined by formula_10 can be defined on the interval .
The functions and are said to commute with each other if . Commutativity is a special property, attained only by particular functions, and often in special circumstances. For example, only when . The picture shows another example.

The composition of one-to-one (injective) functions is always one-to-one. Similarly, the composition of onto (surjective) functions is always onto. It follows that the composition of two bijections is also a bijection. The inverse function of a composition (assumed invertible) has the property that .

Derivatives of compositions involving differentiable functions can be found using the chain rule. Higher derivatives of such functions are given by Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula.

Composition of functions is sometimes described as a kind of multiplication on a function space, but has very different properties from pointwise multiplication of functions (e.g. composition is not commutative).

==Composition monoids==

Suppose one has two (or more) functions having the same domain and codomain; these are often called &quot;transformations&quot;. Then one can form chains of transformations composed together, such as . Such chains have the algebraic structure of a monoid, called a &quot;transformation monoid&quot; or (much more seldom) a &quot;composition monoid&quot;. In general, transformation monoids can have remarkably complicated structure. One particular notable example is the de Rham curve. The set of &quot;all&quot; functions is called the full transformation semigroup or &quot;symmetric semigroup&quot; on . (One can actually define two semigroups depending how one defines the semigroup operation as the left or right composition of functions.)
If the given transformations are bijective (and thus invertible), then the set of all possible combinations of these functions forms a transformation group (also known as a permutation group); and one says that the group is generated by these functions.

The set of all bijective functions (called permutations) forms a group with respect to function composition. This is the symmetric group, also sometimes called the &quot;composition group&quot;. A fundamental result in group theory, Cayley&#x27;s theorem, essentially says that any group is in fact just a subgroup of a symmetric group (up to isomorphism).

In the symmetric semigroup (of all transformations) one also finds a weaker, non-unique notion of inverse (called a pseudoinverse) because the symmetric semigroup is a regular semigroup.

==Functional powers==

If , then formula_11 may compose with itself; this is sometimes denoted as formula_12. That is:


More generally, for any natural number , the th functional power can be defined inductively by , a notation introduced by Hans Heinrich Bürmann and John Frederick William Herschel. Repeated composition of such a function with itself is called function iteration.
* By convention, is defined as the identity map on &#x27;s domain, .
* If and admits an inverse function , negative functional powers are defined for as the negated power of the inverse function: .

Note: If takes its values in a ring (in particular for real or complex-valued ), there is a risk of confusion, as could also stand for the -fold product of , e.g. . For trigonometric functions, usually the latter is meant, at least for positive exponents. For example, in trigonometry, this superscript notation represents standard exponentiation when used with trigonometric functions:

However, for negative exponents (especially −1), it nevertheless usually refers to the inverse function, e.g., .

In some cases, when, for a given function , the equation has a unique solution , that function can be defined as the functional square root of , then written as .

More generally, when has a unique solution for some natural number , then can be defined as .

Under additional restrictions, this idea can be generalized so that the iteration count becomes a continuous parameter; in this case, such a system is called a flow, specified through solutions of Schröder&#x27;s equation. Iterated functions and flows occur naturally in the study of fractals and dynamical systems.

To avoid ambiguity, some mathematicians choose to use to denote the compositional meaning, writing for the -th iterate of the function , as in, for example, meaning . For the same purpose, was used by Benjamin Peirce whereas Alfred Pringsheim and Jules Molk suggested instead.

==Alternative notations==
Many mathematicians, particularly in group theory, omit the composition symbol, writing for .

During the mid-20th century, some mathematicians adopted postfix notation, writing for and for . This can be more natural than prefix notation in many cases, such as in linear algebra when is a row vector and and denote matrices and the composition is by matrix multiplication. The order is important because function composition is not necessarily commutative. Having successive transformations applying and composing to the right agrees with the left-to-right reading sequence.

Mathematicians who use postfix notation may write &quot;, meaning first apply and then apply , in keeping with the order the symbols occur in postfix notation, thus making the notation &quot; ambiguous. Computer scientists may write &quot;&quot; for this, thereby disambiguating the order of composition. To distinguish the left composition operator from a text semicolon, in the Z notation the ⨾ character is used for left relation composition. Since all functions are binary relations, it is correct to use the [fat] semicolon for function composition as well (see the article on composition of relations for further details on this notation).

==Composition operator==

Given a function , the composition operator is defined as that operator which maps functions to functions as formula_13Composition operators are studied in the field of operator theory.

==In programming languages==

Function composition appears in one form or another in numerous programming languages.

==Multivariate functions==
Partial composition is possible for multivariate functions. The function resulting when some argument of the function is replaced by the function is called a composition of and in some computer engineering contexts, and is denoted 
formula_14

When is a simple constant , composition degenerates into a (partial) valuation, whose result is also known as restriction or &quot;co-factor&quot;.

formula_15

In general, the composition of multivariate functions may involve several other functions as arguments, as in the definition of primitive recursive function. Given , a -ary function, and -ary functions , the composition of with , is the -ary function
formula_16

This is sometimes called the generalized composite or superposition of &quot;f&quot; with . The partial composition in only one argument mentioned previously can be instantiated from this more general scheme by setting all argument functions except one to be suitably chosen projection functions. Here can be seen as a single vector/tuple-valued function in this generalized scheme, in which case this is precisely the standard definition of function composition.

A set of finitary operations on some base set &quot;X&quot; is called a clone if it contains all projections and is closed under generalized composition. A clone generally contains operations of various arities. The notion of commutation also finds an interesting generalization in the multivariate case; a function &quot;f&quot; of arity &quot;n&quot; is said to commute with a function &quot;g&quot; of arity &quot;m&quot; if &quot;f&quot; is a homomorphism preserving &quot;g&quot;, and vice versa, that is:
formula_17

A unary operation always commutes with itself, but this is not necessarily the case for a binary (or higher arity) operation. A binary (or higher arity) operation that commutes with itself is called medial or entropic.

==Generalizations==
Composition can be generalized to arbitrary binary relations.
If and are two binary relations, then their composition amounts to

formula_18.

Considering a function as a special case of a binary relation (namely functional relations), function composition satisfies the definition for relation composition. A small circle has been used for the infix notation of composition of relations, as well as functions. When used to represent composition of functions formula_19 however, the text sequence is reversed to illustrate the different operation sequences accordingly.

The composition is defined in the same way for partial functions and Cayley&#x27;s theorem has its analogue called the Wagner–Preston theorem.

The category of sets with functions as morphisms is the prototypical category. The axioms of a category are in fact inspired from the properties (and also the definition) of function composition. The structures given by composition are axiomatized and generalized in category theory with the concept of morphism as the category-theoretical replacement of functions. The reversed order of composition in the formula applies for composition of relations using converse relations, and thus in group theory. These structures form dagger categories.&quot;The standard &quot;foundation&quot; for mathematics starts with sets and their elements. It is possible to start differently, by axiomatising not elements of sets but functions between sets. This can be done by using the language of categories and universal constructions.&quot;
&quot;. . . the membership relation for sets can often be replaced by the composition operation for functions. This leads to an alternative foundation for Mathematics upon categories -- specifically, on the category of all functions. Now much of Mathematics is dynamic, in that it deals with morphisms of an object into another object of the same kind. Such morphisms&quot; (&quot;like functions&quot;) &quot;form categories, and so the approach via categories fits well with the objective of organizing and understanding Mathematics. That, in truth, should be the goal of a proper philosophy of Mathematics.&quot;

<text>Just One Night is a 1980 double album by Eric Clapton, recorded live at the Budokan Theatre in Tokyo, Japan, in December 1979 when Clapton was touring to support &quot;Backless&quot;, his latest record at that time. The album reached No. 2 in the US and No. 3 in the UK, and was certified gold by RIAA.

==Reception==

Critical reaction to the album has been largely positive. At the time of release Robert Christgau said the album contained &quot;AM and FM faves&quot; which were &quot;served hot, raw, or both&quot;. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; ranked the album in the &quot;Top 100 Live Albums&quot;, and suggested that it was superior to the studio albums recorded by Clapton at the time.
