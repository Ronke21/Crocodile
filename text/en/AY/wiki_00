<text>Ronald Charles McKernan (September 8, 1945 – March 8, 1973), known as Pigpen, was an American musician. He was a founding member of the San Francisco band the Grateful Dead and played in the group from 1965 to 1972.

McKernan grew up heavily influenced by African-American music, particularly the blues, and enjoyed listening to his father&#x27;s collection of records and taught himself how to play harmonica and piano. He began socializing around the San Francisco Bay Area, becoming friends with Jerry Garcia. After the pair had played in various folk and jug bands, McKernan suggested they form an electric group, which became the Grateful Dead. He was the band&#x27;s original frontman and played harmonica and electric organ, but Garcia and bassist Phil Lesh&#x27;s influences on the band became increasingly stronger as they embraced psychedelic rock. McKernan struggled to keep up with the changing music, causing the group to hire keyboardist Tom Constanten, with McKernan&#x27;s contributions essentially limited to vocals, harmonica, and percussion from November 1968 to January 1970. He continued to be a frontman in concert for some numbers, including his interpretations of Bobby Bland&#x27;s &quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot; and the Rascals&#x27; &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;.

Unlike the other members of the Grateful Dead, McKernan avoided psychedelic drugs, preferring to drink alcohol (namely whiskey and flavored fortified wine). By 1971, his health had been affected by alcoholism and liver damage and doctors advised him to stop touring. Following a hiatus, he resumed touring with the group in December 1971 but was forced to retire from touring altogether in June 1972. McKernan was found dead of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage on March 8, 1973, aged 27, and is buried at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ronald Charles McKernan was born on September 8, 1945, in San Bruno, California. He came from Irish ancestry, and his father, Phil McKernan, was an R&amp;B and blues disc jockey, who has been reported to have been one of the first white DJs on KDIA (later renamed KMKY), then a black radio station, by several sources. Other sources place him at Berkeley station, KRE (later renamed KBLX-FM). Ronald grew up with African American friends and enjoyed black music and culture. As a youth, he taught himself blues piano, guitar and harmonica and developed a biker culture image. McKernan moved to Palo Alto, California, with his family, where he became friends with musician Jerry Garcia at the age of 14. He built up a substantial collection of old blues 78s from labels such as Kent and Chess.

McKernan began spending time around coffeehouses and music stores, and worked at Dana Morgan&#x27;s Music Store in Palo Alto with Garcia. One night Garcia invited McKernan on stage to play harmonica and sing the blues. Garcia was impressed and McKernan became the blues singer in local jam sessions. He was initially nicknamed &quot;Blue Ron&quot; before settling on &quot;Pigpen&quot;. Onomastician Adrian Room has suggested McKernan was given the name due to his untidy and unclean habits and band biographies say he got the nickname owing to his similarity to Pig-Pen, the permanently-dirty character in the comic-strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;.

===Grateful Dead===
Along with Garcia and second guitarist Bob Weir, McKernan was a participant in the predecessor groups leading to the formation of the Grateful Dead, beginning with the Zodiacs and Mother McCree&#x27;s Uptown Jug Champions. Drummer Bill Kreutzmann was added and the band evolved into the Warlocks. Around 1965, McKernan urged the rest of the Warlocks to switch to electric instruments. Bassist Phil Lesh joined soon after, and they became the Grateful Dead. The group were keen to involve McKernan in the band, as he was the group&#x27;s original leader and was considered the best singer and frontman.

The Dead&#x27;s early sets centered around blues and R&amp;B songs chosen by McKernan. By the end of 1966, Garcia had improved his musical skills, changing the band&#x27;s direction and reducing McKernan&#x27;s contributions. In 1967, drummer Mickey Hart joined the Grateful Dead, followed by classically trained keyboardist Tom Constanten in 1968, further changing the group&#x27;s style. Constanten often replaced McKernan on keyboards in the studio, as McKernan found it difficult to adapt to the new material that Garcia and Lesh composed for the band.

In October 1968, McKernan and Weir were nearly fired from the band after Garcia and Lesh believed their playing was holding the band back from lengthy and experimental jamming. Garcia delegated the task of firing them to Rock Scully, who said that McKernan &quot;took it hard.&quot; Weir promised to improve, but McKernan was more stubborn. According to Garcia biographer Blair Jackson, McKernan missed three Dead shows before vowing not to &quot;be lazy&quot; any more and rejoining, while Kreutzmann objected to replacing McKernan and said the event never happened. Following his discharge from the United States Air Force in November 1968, Constanten officially joined the band, having only worked in the studio while on leave up to that point. Road manager Jon McIntire commented that &quot;Pigpen was relegated to the congas at that point and it was really humiliating and he was really hurt, but he couldn&#x27;t show it, couldn&#x27;t talk about it.&quot; He began to take Hammond organ lessons and learned how to use the various drawbars and controls.

After Constanten&#x27;s departure in January 1970 over musical and lifestyle differences, McKernan nominally resumed keyboard duties. He played an instrument on two tracks only (Hammond organ on &quot;Black Peter&quot; and harmonica on &quot;Easy Wind&quot;, on which he also sang lead) on &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot; (1970), the band&#x27;s breakthrough studio release. On the follow-up album &quot;American Beauty&quot;, keyboard parts were handled by Garcia and Lesh, along with session musicians Howard Wales and Ned Lagin. The 1971 live album &quot;Grateful Dead&quot; featured three overdubbed organ parts from Merl Saunders in addition to McKernan&#x27;s contributions on &quot;Big Railroad Blues&quot;, &quot;The Other One&quot;, and &quot;Me &amp; Bobby McGee&quot;. While Garcia expressed frustration at McKernan&#x27;s missed rehearsals and his inability to keep up with new material, Lesh was more forgiving, maintaining that &quot;it was okay for Pigpen to lay out ... we kept wanting Pigpen to be there because he was &#x27;one of us.&#x27; &quot;

==Musical style and influences==
While in the Grateful Dead, McKernan sang and played blues-influenced organ and harmonica. He initially played a Lowrey T1 (often confused for a Farfisa combo organ) before switching to the more elaborate Vox Continental in 1966. He began to alternate between the Vox Continental and the Hammond B-3 in June 1967, usually reserving the former instrument for outdoor and impromptu concerts, including the band&#x27;s performance at the Columbia University protests of 1968. During Tom Constanten&#x27;s tenure with the group, McKernan occasionally played his bandmate&#x27;s double-manual Vox Super Continental on some songs (most notably &quot;Death Don&#x27;t Have No Mercy&quot;) through May 1969. With the exception of select acoustic sets in 1970 in which he played upright piano, he used the Hammond exclusively thereafter.

McKernan sang lead on several standards he wanted the Dead to record, such as Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Pain in My Heart&quot; and Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot;, with the latter serving as one of the band&#x27;s main improvisatory vehicles from 1966 to 1968. Unlike fellow vocalists Garcia and Weir, he sang lead without playing any instrument except harmonica and actively interacted with the audience, occasionally walking out into the crowd. During the band&#x27;s first year when they played straightforward blues, McKernan performed the majority of lead vocals, attracting an early audience that came specifically to see him sing and play harmonica. He took on early management duties in the band, ensuring they would be paid and promoted properly for gigs.

Though McKernan&#x27;s garage rock style was appropriate for their early recordings, it was less suited to the group&#x27;s later psychedelic and jamming styles. He went from contributing to every song and singing lead on all of side two of 1968&#x27;s &quot;Anthem of the Sun&quot; to little more than sporadic appearances on the following year&#x27;s &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot;. He continued to front the band for long stretches during their live performances and suggested new material for the Dead&#x27;s concert repertoire, including Redding&#x27;s &quot;Hard to Handle&quot; and James Brown&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot;.

McKernan achieved a new prominence in 1969 singing &quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot;; initially introduced in 1967, the song gradually evolved into the band&#x27;s show-stopping finale, often taking fifteen to thirty minutes to complete. He improvised lyrics over the band&#x27;s accompaniment, using phrases he had heard from African American friends, such as &quot;rider&quot; (slang for &quot;lover&quot;), &quot;she&#x27;s got box-back nitties&quot; (referring to female underwear) and &quot;boar hog&#x27;s eye&quot; (reference to female anatomy). When the Grateful Dead appeared at Woodstock, the band&#x27;s set (which was marred by technical problems and general chaos and described as one of their worst shows) ended with &quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot;. Even as his instrumental contributions waned, McKernan&#x27;s vocal performances remained an integral part of the band&#x27;s live set; by early 1971, their cover of the Rascals&#x27; &quot;Good Lovin (initially performed by the group as early as 1966 and featured at shows at the Fillmore East later released as &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen... the Grateful Dead&quot;) began to emerge as a secondary showcase of his improvisatory talents alongside &quot;Love Light&quot;.

McKernan was not a prolific songwriter, preferring to concentrate on blues covers and improvised lyrics. He composed the infrequently performed &quot;Operator&quot; for 1970&#x27;s &quot;American Beauty&quot;. Several new songs emerged from a creatively fecund period coinciding with his health problems in 1971, most notably &quot;Mr. Charlie&quot;, a collaboration with Dead lyricist Robert Hunter. The song appeared on the live album &quot;Europe &#x27;72&quot;, his last with the group.

Tony Sclafani has compared McKernan&#x27;s role in the band, initially strong and pivotal but gradually declining, to that of Brian Jones in the Rolling Stones, particularly since both men were primarily influenced by the blues over rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and died aged 27. In contrast, though, McKernan was always encouraged to sing material live and left the group due to ill health, while Jones was fired.

After McKernan&#x27;s death, a number of recordings were found in his apartment, which have appeared as the bootleg recording &quot;The Apartment Tapes&quot;. This included two songs recorded in 1964 with future Jefferson Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen. On the bootleg, McKernan played acoustic guitar and piano, instruments he seldom used with the Dead.

==Personal life==
McKernan was close friends with American singer-songwriter Janis Joplin due to common musical influences and lifestyles, particularly a shared love of alcohol over other drugs; a poster from the early 1970s showed them together at 710 Ashbury Street, the Grateful Dead&#x27;s communal home from 1966 to 1968. Joplin joined McKernan on stage at the Fillmore West on June 7, 1969, with the Grateful Dead to sing his signature &quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot;, reprising this duet on July 16, 1970, at the Euphoria Ballroom in San Rafael, California.

He developed a close friendship with fellow keyboardist Tom Constanten based on their mutual aversion to psychedelics and eventually served as best man at Constanten&#x27;s first wedding. While his bandmates and friends were using cannabis, LSD, and other hallucinogenic drugs, McKernan preferred alcoholic beverages such as Thunderbird and Southern Comfort. Ironically, McKernan was arrested and fined after the cannabis bust on November 9, 1967, at 710 Ashbury Street, even though he did not use the drug. The event was covered in the first issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, where the reporter noted McKernan had a substantial rifle collection and McKernan&#x27;s picture appeared on a contemporary report in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Because neither took illegal drugs, McKernan and Constanten were the only members of the band not arrested in the January 31, 1970, police raid that inspired the lyrics of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Truckin&#x27;&quot;.

In the early years of the Grateful Dead, McKernan was easily recognisable by his biker image, making him a minor celebrity. In 1969, the band&#x27;s record company, Warner Bros., ran a &quot;Pigpen Look-Alike Contest&quot;.

==Health and death==

McKernan&#x27;s alcohol abuse had begun to affect his health by his mid twenties. By the early 1970s, he also began to experience symptoms of primary biliary cholangitis, an autoimmune disease that was unrelated to his use of alcohol. After he was hospitalized in August 1971, doctors requested that he stop touring indefinitely. Pianist Keith Godchaux was subsequently hired and remained a regular member of the Grateful Dead until 1979. McKernan rejoined the band in December 1971 to supplement Godchaux on harmonica, percussion, and organ. Although manager Rock Scully alleged that McKernan passed out in front of his Hammond organ at one show during this period, Garcia biographer Blair Jackson has lauded the quality and frequency of his instrumental contributions on the &quot;Europe &#x27;72&quot; tour. Once again, however, his health deteriorated to the point where he could no longer perform. On June 17, 1972, at the Hollywood Bowl, he made his final concert appearance. He subsequently broke off all personal relationships with the band, explaining &quot;I don&#x27;t want you around when I die.&quot;

While Jackson has asserted that McKernan &quot;didn&#x27;t drink for the last 17 months of his life&quot; in conjunction with an effort to ameliorate his health, Grateful Dead tour manager Sam Cutler later maintained that he &quot;[made] sure [McKernan] had booze&quot; on the &quot;Europe &#x27;72&quot; tour. According to David Browne, McKernan &quot;[lived] on sunflower seeds and alcohol&quot; in the final months of his life.

On March 8, 1973, aged 27, he was found dead of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage at his home in Corte Madera, California, by his landlady. Though his contributions to the band had slowly diminished over the years, the other members were devastated at his death. McKernan was buried at the Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto, California. Garcia spoke at his funeral, saying &quot;After Pigpen&#x27;s death we all knew this was the end of the original Grateful Dead&quot;.

==Legacy==
Despite his outward image, friends and band biographers have described McKernan as a quiet, kind, and introspective person. Hart later said &quot;Pigpen was the &quot;musician&quot; in the Grateful Dead.&quot; Kreutzmann said McKernan was &quot;the sweetest guy anybody had ever met.&quot;

Weir later became influenced by McKernan&#x27;s ability to work a crowd and improvise lyrics. He took over de facto frontman duties in concert and began to reintroduce material originally chosen by McKernan into the Dead&#x27;s live set after his death. Weir began singing &quot;Good Lovin with the Dead in 1974, and the group recorded the song on 1978&#x27;s &quot;Shakedown Street&quot;. &quot;Turn On Your Love Light&quot; was revived in 1981, with Weir singing lead. He also revived the 1960s standard &quot;Big Boy Pete&quot;, originally sung by McKernan, as a one-off in 1985. Jimmy Reed&#x27;s &quot;Big Boss Man&quot;, recorded by the group on &quot;Grateful Dead (Skull and Roses)&quot; with McKernan singing lead, was revived by Garcia and performed occasionally through the 1980s and 90s.

&quot;He&#x27;s Gone&quot;, originally appearing on the live album &quot;Europe &#x27;72&quot;, subsequently became a eulogy to McKernan by his former bandmates. Hunter said &quot;it became an anthem for Pigpen&quot;.

McKernan was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

<text>USS &quot;Liberty&quot; (AGTR-5) was a &quot;Belmont&quot;-class technical research ship (i.e. an electronic spying ship) that was attacked by Israel Defense Forces during the 1967 Six-Day War. She was originally built and served in World War II as a VC2-S-AP3 type Victory cargo ship named SS &quot;Simmons Victory&quot;. Her keel was laid down on 23 February 1945 at Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation of Portland, Oregon.

In 1967, Israeli air force and naval units attacked the research ship during the Six-Day War. Israel later apologized for the attack, stating it had mistaken &quot;Liberty&quot; for an Egyptian ship, although the reason for the attack has been disputed. &quot;Liberty&quot; would eventually be decommissioned some time after the attack and was sold for scrapping in 1973 as it had been damaged beyond feasible repair.

==Service history==
===Construction===
Her keel was laid down on 23 February 1945, under a Maritime Commission contract at Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation of Portland, Oregon. She entered service as a VC2-S-AP3 type Victory cargo ship named SS &quot;Simmons Victory&quot;.

===Early years===

The ship was delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 4 May 1945. The next day, she was transferred to the &quot;Coastwise -Pacific Far East Line&quot; and designated as a &quot;Fleet Issue Ship&quot;. Her complement included a 17-man Navy Armed Guard detachment to operate the ship&#x27;s gun battery; a three- or four-man communication liaison detachment; and 16 Navy enlisted people serving as &quot;winchmen and hatchmen&quot;.

SS &quot;Simmons Victory&quot; was tasked with delivering ammunition, which was loaded at the San Francisco-Suisun Bay area navy munitions depot at Port Chicago for Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan. According to Harry Morgan, who served as an engineer on the ship, the &quot;Simmons Victory&quot; arrived in the Philippines about six weeks before V-E Day on 8 May 1945. She made one trip north in support of Operation Downfall and returned to the Philippines. She was in Leyte Gulf when Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945.

&quot;Simmons Victory&quot; departed Leyte Gulf on 6 October 1945, en route to the US West Coast via Eniwetok, and dumped ammunition at sea two days later. She arrived in San Francisco on 3 November 1945 and departed for the US east coast on 9 December 1945, reaching New York on Christmas Day, 1945. Her 5-inch, 3-inch, and 20-mm guns were removed there on 9 January 1946.

From December 1946 until 1963, the ship moved back and forth several times from commercial charters as a break bulk cargo carrier to stints in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (being twice berthed in the Hudson River). Most notably during this time, she made nine trips to the Far East between November 1950 and December 1952 during the Korean War &quot;to equip American troops fighting communist North Korea&quot; in the Military Sea Transportation Service. On 11 June 1958, &quot;Simmons Victory&quot; once again entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet, being berthed this time at Olympia, Washington, where she remained until 1963.

===US Navy years===

In February 1963, the U.S. Navy acquired &quot;Simmons Victory&quot; and converted her to a &quot;Miscellaneous Auxiliary&quot; ship at Willamette Iron and Steel of Portland. On 8 June, the vessel was renamed USS &quot;Liberty&quot; and given the hull classification symbol AG-168. On 1 April 1964, she was reclassified a Technical Research Ship (AGTR-5). She was commissioned at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, in December 1964.

In February 1965, &quot;Liberty&quot; steamed from the West Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, where she was further outfitted (cost: US$20 million) to suit her for a mission of supporting the National Security Agency by collecting and processing foreign communications and other electronic emissions of possible national defense interests. In June, &quot;Liberty&quot; began her first deployment, to waters off the west coast of Africa. She carried out several more operations during the next two years, and went to the Mediterranean Sea in 1967. During the Six-Day War between Israel and several Arab nations, she was sent to collect electronic intelligence in the eastern Mediterranean.

====Israeli attack====

On the afternoon of 8 June 1967, while in international waters off the northern coast of the Sinai Peninsula, &quot;Liberty&quot; was attacked and damaged by aircraft of the Israeli Air Force and motor torpedo boats of the Israeli Navy; 34 American crewmen were killed and 174 wounded. Though &quot;Liberty&quot; was severely damaged, with a hole amidships and a twisted keel, her crew kept her afloat, and she was able to leave the area under her own power. Later, Israel apologized for the attack, stating it had mistaken &quot;Liberty&quot; for an Egyptian ship, as the incident occurred during the Six-Day War. In total, Israel gave close to $13 million (about $117 million in 2022) to the U.S. in compensation for the incident. This includes compensation to the families of those killed and wounded, and to cover damage of the ship.

The incident has become a subject of controversy and debate, with many books written on the topic.

After the attack, she was escorted to Valletta, Malta, by units of the Sixth Fleet and given temporary repairs. After the repairs were completed, &quot;Liberty&quot; returned to the United States on 27 July 1967. She was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 June 1968. She was laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet of Norfolk until December 1970, when she was transferred to the Maritime Administration for disposal. In 1973, she was sold for scrapping to the Boston Metals Company of Baltimore, Maryland.

As a result of the crew&#x27;s heroic response to the Israeli attack, &quot;Liberty&quot; is the US Navy&#x27;s &quot;most highly decorated ship ... for a single action&quot;. For the action with Israeli forces, she was awarded the Combat Action Ribbon (8-9 June 1967) and the Presidential Unit Citation (8 June 1967). Although President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Presidential Unit Citation in 1968, it was not formally presented to the crew until June 1991. President George H. W. Bush declined to attend the 1991 White House ceremony, instead merely waving at the crew while passing by.

Commander (later Captain) William McGonagle, &quot;Liberty&quot;″s commanding officer, received the Medal of Honor. Numerous members of the crew were decorated, including 11 members of the crew who were awarded Silver Stars, 20 with Bronze Stars, and over 200 who received Purple Hearts. The unidentified remains of six of &quot;Liberty&quot;&#x27;s crew are buried under a single headstone in a mass grave in Arlington National Cemetery.

&quot;Liberty&quot; was also awarded the National Defense Service Medal.

<text>The United States Soccer Federation (USSF), commonly referred to as U.S. Soccer, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and the official governing body of soccer in the United States. It is a full member of FIFA and governs American soccer at the international, professional, and amateur levels, including: the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams, Major League Soccer (MLS), the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL), youth organizations, as well as the beach soccer, futsal, Paralympic, and deaf national teams. U.S. Soccer sanctions referees and soccer tournaments for most soccer leagues in the United States. It also administers and operates the U.S. Open Cup and SheBelieves Cup. U.S. Soccer is headquartered in Chicago.

==History==
U.S. Soccer was originally known as the United States Football Association. It formed on April 5, 1913, at the Astor House Hotel in Lower Manhattan, and on August 15 of that year was accepted as one of the earliest member organizations of FIFA and the first from North and Central America. The affiliation was originally provisional but during FIFA Congress in Oslo, Norway on June 24, 1914, the USFA, as it was abbreviated at the time, was accepted as a full FIFA member. The governing body of the sport in the United States added the word &quot;soccer&quot; to its name in 1945, when it became the United States Soccer Football Association; by this point, &quot;football&quot; as a standalone word had come to define a totally different sport in the U.S. It dropped the word &quot;football&quot; from its name in 1974 to become known as the United States Soccer Federation.

U.S. Soccer has hosted several global soccer tournaments, including the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the 1999 and 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, and the Summer Olympic football tournaments in 1984 and 1996.

===Headquarters and national training center===
Originally based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, U.S. Soccer headquarters were moved to Chicago in 1991 under the leadership of former Secretary General, Hank Steinbrecher Called U.S. Soccer House, it is currently located in two refurbished mansions at 1801 South Prairie Avenue in Chicago.

In 2003, U.S. Soccer opened their National Training Center at Dignity Health Sports Park (then named Home Depot Center) in Carson, California. The $130 million facility includes a soccer-specific stadium, home to the MLS team Los Angeles Galaxy. Additionally, four grass soccer fields, a FieldTurf soccer field and a general training area are specifically dedicated to U.S. Soccer. Both the senior and youth men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s U.S. national teams hold regular camps at Dignity Health Sports Park.

U.S. Soccer was also exploring a possibility of building the National Training and Coaching Development Center in Kansas City, Kansas. On April 9, 2015, the Development Center received final approval from the local governments. U.S. Soccer agreed to a 20-year lease, with the project set to break ground in 2016 and finishing some time in 2017.

In September 2023, U.S. Soccer announced they were moving from Chicago to a new headquarters and training center south of Atlanta, which will be partially funded by Arthur Blank, cofounder of The Home Depot and owner of the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons and MLS’s Atlanta United. In December 2023, U.S. Soccer announced they had chosen a site for the new national training center in Fayette County, Georgia. The site is scheduled to be developed and opened prior to the 2026 FIFA World Cup; it is in the same metropolitan area as the headquarters of Coca-Cola, one of the founding partners for the training center. The new training center will be named after Arthur Blank to honor his involvement in the move.
There are currently temporary offices for U.S. Soccer in Fayette County at Town Trilith where Trilith Studios is located.

==Organization and governance==

U.S. Soccer is governed by a board of directors that administers the affairs of U.S. Soccer. Cindy Parlow Cone, former 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup champion and long-time U.S. Soccer administrator, became president in March 2020 following the resignation of Carlos Cordeiro. JT Batson was named chief executive officer and secretary general in September 2022.

U.S. Soccer members are individuals and affiliate organizations. The national council is the representative membership body of the federation. It elects the president and vice president, amends the bylaws, approves the budgets, decides on policies adopted by the board, and affirms actions of the Board. The non-profit organization is a member of the worldwide soccer body FIFA and the North American soccer body CONCACAF, and also has a relationship with the U.S. Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee.

The federation convenes an annual meeting, usually held in February. Every four years, the annual meeting&#x27;s attendees hold an election for the federation&#x27;s president and vice president.

== National teams ==

===U.S. men&#x27;s national team===

The United States men&#x27;s national team was assembled in 1885 to play Canada in the first international match held outside the United Kingdom. The team was invited to the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930 and qualified for the World Cup in 1934, finishing third place (semifinals) in 1930 out of 13 teams participating. In 1950 the United States scored one of its most surprising victories with a 1–0 win over heavily favored England, who were amongst the world&#x27;s best sides at the time. The United States did not reach another World Cup until an upstart team qualified for the 1990 World Cup with the &quot;goal heard around the world&quot; scored by Paul Caligiuri against Trinidad and Tobago, which started the modern era of soccer in the United States.

The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, setting total and average attendance records that still stand, including drawing 94,194 fans to the final. The United States made a surprising run to the second round in 1994, but finished last among the 32 teams in the 1998 World Cup. The tournament was marred by poor team chemistry and leadership, which led head coach Steve Sampson to resign. Sampson was replaced by Bruce Arena, a two-time MLS Cup winner with D.C. United, in 1998. Arena led a mix of veterans and youth players to a quarterfinal appearance in the 2002 World Cup, defeating rivals Mexico in the Round of 16 before losing to eventual runners-up Germany.

At the 2006 edition of the tournament, the U.S. failed to qualify for a knockout round with two losses and a draw in the group stage. Arena&#x27;s contract was not renewed following the tournament; former assistant Bob Bradley was hired as head coach in 2007. The U.S. qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa by winning the CONCACAF qualifying tournament. At the World Cup, the Americans were undefeated in the group stage but were eliminated in the round of 16 by a loss to Ghana. Bradley was dismissed following the 2011 Gold Cup, which the United States lost 4–2 to Mexico in the final.

The U.S. entered the 2014 FIFA World Cup under Jürgen Klinsmann, who had led Germany to third place in the 2006 World Cup and had lived in the United States for several years. Klinsmann recruited dual national players, particularly Germans with American heritage, and favored youth in his rosters; this included his exclusion of Landon Donovan from the World Cup roster. The U.S. finished second in the &quot;Group of Death&quot; (eventual champion Germany, Ghana, and Portugal) and advanced to the round of 16, where they lost to Belgium in extra time after goalkeeper Tim Howard&#x27;s 16 saves set a World Cup record. Klinsmann was retained as head coach for the 2018 World Cup qualifying cycle, but was fired in November 2016 after the team had lost the opening two matches of the final qualifying round. Bruce Arena was hired to replace Klinsmann, but the United States finished fifth and were unable to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It was the first time the U.S. had failed to qualify for the World Cup since 1986.

Arena resigned following the qualification campaign and was replaced by Dave Sarachan, who was interim coach during the search for a permanent head coach. Sarachan&#x27;s year-long tenure included the introduction of several young players to replace veterans who had resigned following the 2018 qualification cycle. Columbus Crew coach Gregg Berhalter was selected and hired as head coach in December 2018; his rosters rely mostly on younger players who had played in MLS academies or were developed by teams in Europe. During qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the United States had rosters with an average age of under 24 years old; the team finished 7–3–4 during the final round and qualified for the World Cup. Berhalter used the second-youngest roster at the World Cup with only DeAndre Yedlin retained from a previous World Cup team. The United States finished second in their group with a win against Iran and ties with England and Wales. The team were eliminated in the round of 16 by the Netherlands.

Berhalter&#x27;s contract was renewed in June 2023 following an investigation by U.S. Soccer into allegations of domestic abuse from a 1991 incident. During his absence from the team, two assistant coaches served as interim coaches. B.J. Callaghan, the second interim coach, led the United States to a second CONCACAF Nations League title but failed to reach the final of the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Berhalter was fired in July 2024 following the team&#x27;s group-stage exit at the 2024 Copa América and replaced in September 2024 by Mauricio Pochettino, an Argentinian manager with experience in European leagues.

The United States will co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico after their joint bid was selected over Morocco by FIFA in 2018. The tournament will be the first World Cup to feature 48 teams. The United States will also host the 2024 Copa América, the championship of South American teams; it will be the second Copa América to be played in the United States following the Copa América Centenario in 2016. The United States did not automatically qualify as hosts, but earned a spot through their performance in the 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League.

===U.S. women&#x27;s national team===

Having won four FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup tournaments—1991, 1999, 2015, and 2019—the United States is considered the most successful in international women&#x27;s soccer. The team finished second in 2011 and third in 1995, 2003, and 2007. It has won Olympic gold medals at the 1996, 2004, 2008, and 2012 Summer Olympics. In addition, it has won ten titles at the Algarve Cup and nine at the CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Championship, the qualifying tournament for the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

The inaugural FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was held in 1991 in China. The U.S. women&#x27;s national team was the first team to win the prize after beating Norway in the final.

In 1999, the United States hosted the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup for the first time. During their tournament run, the women&#x27;s national team established a new level of popularity for the women&#x27;s game, culminating in a final against China that drew 90,185 fans, an all-time attendance record for a women&#x27;s sports event, to a sold-out Rose Bowl. After neither team scored in regulation or extra time, the final went to a penalty shootout, which the United States won 5–4. The celebration by Brandi Chastain after she converted the winning penalty, in which she took off her shirt, is one of the more famous images in U.S. women&#x27;s sports.

===Youth national teams===
U.S. Soccer Federation oversees and promotes the development of 14 youth national teams: 
*U.S. Under-23 Men
*U.S. Under-23 Women
*U.S. Under-20 Men
*U.S. Under-20 Women
*U.S. Under-19 Men
*U.S. Under-19 Women
*U.S. Under-18 Men
*U.S. Under-18 Women
*U.S. Under-17 Men
*U.S. Under-17 Women
*U.S. Under-16 Boys
*U.S. Under-16 Girls
*U.S. Under-15 Boys
*U.S. Under-15 Girls

U.S. Soccer Federation had ceased operations on its youth national team programming with the exception of the U-23, U-20, and U-17 teams on the men&#x27;s side and the U-20 and U-17 teams on the women&#x27;s side due to the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020.

===Extended national teams===
As of March 2023, U.S. Soccer Federation supervises nine extended national teams across the disciplines of beach soccer, CP soccer, deaf soccer, futsal, and power soccer.

===Coaches and technical staff===

==Professional leagues==
Despite the growth of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s professional soccer in the United States in the last few decades, by far the largest category of soccer in the United States, at least in terms of participation, is youth soccer. Though organized locally by organizations all over the United States, there are two main youth soccer organizations working nationwide through affiliated local associations. The United States Youth Soccer Association boasts over three million players between the ages of five and 19, while American Youth Soccer Organization has more than 300,000 players between the ages of four and 19. This makes soccer one of the most played sports by children in the United States.

===Men===

The professional first-division league in North America is Major League Soccer, which as of the 2025 season has 27 teams in the U.S. and 3 in Canada. The league began an aggressive expansion in 2017, with the goal of adding at least eight clubs. That effort has resulted in the addition of the following ten clubs: Atlanta United FC (2017), Minnesota United FC (2017), Los Angeles FC (2018), FC Cincinnati (2019), Inter Miami CF (2020), Nashville SC (2020), Austin FC (2021), Charlotte FC (2022), St. Louis City SC (2023), and San Diego FC (2025). The league operates as a single-entity league, which means MLS, and not the individual teams, holds the contracts on players.

The one sanctioned second-division men&#x27;s outdoor soccer league is the USL Championship (USLC). Previously, the second North American Soccer League had second-division status, sharing it with the USL in the 2017 season, but the NASL was denied second-division sanctioning for 2018 due to considerable instability in the league; the league effectively folded at that time.

The USLC was sanctioned as the United States&#x27; lone Division II men&#x27;s outdoor soccer league in 2018. Formed in 2010 as a result of the merger of the former USL First Division and USL Second Division, the USL Championship was sanctioned as Division III league from 2011 to 2016 before becoming provisionally sanctioned as a Division II league for 2017, and receiving full Division II sanctioning in 2018.

The USL Championship has expanded almost three-fold since its first season in 2011 to include 35 teams in the 2020 season, with the league divided into two conferences, Eastern and Western. The USLC is the world&#x27;s largest Division II professional league by number of teams. Since 2014, valuation of USL Championship clubs have increased five-fold. In revenue, 2018 Championship clubs saw a 28% increase over 2017 numbers on an average of ticketing, sponsorship, merchandise, and ancillary revenue generation.

The USLC also holds a broadcast agreement with ESPN that sees 20 regular season games televised nationally on ESPN2, ESPNews and ESPN Deportes in addition to national broadcast of the USL Championship Final, which in 2019 was aired on both ESPN2 and ESPN Deportes. The league&#x27;s remaining regular season games are broadcast nationally on ESPN+, with 22 of the Championship&#x27;s clubs also holding local broadcast agreements. The USL Championship&#x27;s broadcast agreement was made possible in large part by a major investment by USL with league technology partner Vista Worldlink to establish a USL Broadcast Center out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

The second NASL had no official tie to the former NASL that operated from 1968 to 1984, although some of the teams shared names with their historic counterparts. Unlike MLS that is a single-entity operation, the second NASL, like the old NASL, had no salary cap and players were contracted by the individual teams. The season was a split format (similar to that of many leagues in Latin America) that features seven teams, including one Puerto Rican team. Previous to the reorganization of the NASL in 2009, the USL First Division operated as the professional second-division league in the United States. However, a dispute among its teams and ownership led to the creation of the NASL which applied for and was awarded by USSF second division status. The 2010 season was played as a combined USL/NASL league format before NASL officially separated in 2011.

USL League One is sanctioned at the Men&#x27;s Division III level. In March 2017, United Soccer League, administrator of the USL Championship and USL League Two, announced following the successful sanctioning of the USL Championship as a Division II league it would start a new tier in its professional structure, which became USL League One, and seek Division III certification for the 2019 season. The league received sanctioning in December 2018 and conducted a successful first season in 2019 that saw 10 teams compete in a single-table format and North Texas SC claim its inaugural league title. The seven independent clubs averaged 2,496 fans per match in 2019, placing League One in the top three of Division III leagues globally, and the league has expanded to include 12 teams for its second season in 2020, with further expansion expected prior to the 2021 season.

National Independent Soccer Association (NISA) led by former Chicago Fire general manager Peter Wilt plans on fielding 8–10 teams in 2018 and has stated that it will seek third-division certification.

A fourth-division league in the United States is the USL League Two, which as of 2015 is expected to have 58 U.S. teams, and six Canadian teams. Though League Two does have some paid players, it also has many teams that are made up entirely or almost entirely of college soccer players who use the league as an opportunity to play competitive soccer in front of professional scouts during the summer, while retaining amateur status and NCAA eligibility. Other fourth-division leagues in the United States are the United Premier Soccer League, National Premier Soccer League and Ligas Unidas.

In addition to MLS and the USL, the United States Adult Soccer Association governs amateur soccer competition for adults throughout the United States, which is effectively the amateur fifth-division of soccer in the United States. The USASA sanctions regional tournaments that allow entry into the U.S. Open Cup, the oldest continuous national soccer competition in the United States. Since 1914, the competition has been open to all U.S. Soccer affiliated clubs, and currently pits teams from all five levels of the American soccer pyramid against each other each year, similarly to England&#x27;s FA Cup.

===Women===

The National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL) is the professional, top-division league in North America and as of 2024, is composed of 14 teams based in the U.S. Two professional, top-division leagues preceded the NWSL: the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA), which featured many players from the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s Cup-winning team (as well as other national teams), ran from 2001 to 2003 and Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS) ran from 2009 to 2011.

Two second-division leagues currently exist: United Women&#x27;s Soccer began play in May 2016 and as of 2020 features 30 teams in five conferences and the Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League (WPSL), started in 1997, features over 115 teams across the United States and Canada (the largest women&#x27;s soccer league in the world as of 2020). Previously, the USL W-League was a semi-professional league that ran from 1995 to 2015 and featured a mix of college students and international players.

====First division ====

=====National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL), 2013–present=====
On November 21, 2012, U.S. Soccer, in conjunction with the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) and Mexican Football Federation (FMF), announced the formation of a new professional league for the 2013 season. The league, unnamed at the time of the initial announcement but later unveiled as the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL), launched in April 2013 with eight teams. Like WUSA and WPS, NWSL teams are privately owned with some owned by existing MLS teams. The American and Canadian federations pay the salaries for many of their respective national team members. U.S. Soccer initially committed to funding up to 24 national team members, with the CSA committing to paying 16 players and FMF pledging support for at least 12 and possibly as many as 16. In addition, U.S. Soccer housed the league&#x27;s front office for the first four years, and scheduled matches to avoid any possible conflict with international tournaments. Four of the league&#x27;s charter teams had WPS ties—the Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, Sky Blue FC, and the Western New York Flash. The other four initial teams were located in the Kansas City, Portland, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. markets with the Portland team run by the Portland Timbers of MLS. The NWSL expanded to nine teams for 2014 by adding the Houston Dash, run by the Houston Dynamo of MLS. In 2016, it expanded to 10 with the addition of another MLS-backed team, the Orlando Pride. Ahead of the 2017 season, A&amp;E Networks announced it had taken an equity stake in the league and Lifetime would begin broadcasting games to a national television audience. , additional expansion teams were being discussed by Los Angeles FC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC, and FC Barcelona, but none of these have yet materialized.

Several league changes occurred in advance of the 2017 season. First, FMF and U.S. Soccer amicably ended their partnership following FMF&#x27;s establishment of its own women&#x27;s professional league, Liga MX Femenil. The Western New York Flash ceased fully professional operations (though retaining its youth and, for a time, semi-pro operations), selling its NWSL franchise rights to Steve Malik, owner of then-NASL and current USLC side North Carolina FC. Malik relocated the NWSL team to NCFC&#x27;s home of the Research Triangle and rebranded it as the North Carolina Courage. Both the Boston Breakers and FC Kansas City folded, with FCKC&#x27;s player contracts transferred to Utah Royals FC, a new side owned and operated by Real Salt Lake.

The Seattle franchise went through two major changes in subsequent years. First, the team moved from Seattle to Tacoma and rebranded as Reign FC before the 2019 season. Then, in January 2020, the team was purchased by the parent company of French Ligue 1 power Olympique Lyonnais and rebranded again as OL Reign.

The league&#x27;s next expansion was announced in November 2019, with a Louisville franchise granted to the ownership group of USLC side Louisville City FC, The Louisville side, which began play as Racing Louisville FC in 2021, is the first NWSL team whose entry into the league was announced more than 5 months before it started play.

=====Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS), 2009–2011=====

The second professional league, Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS), was founded in 2009. The inaugural season champion was Sky Blue FC, based in the New York–New Jersey area. The team defeated the Los Angeles Sol 1–0 at The Home Depot Center in Carson, California. The WPS launched with seven teams, all based in the United States. The Sol folded after the league&#x27;s inaugural season, and two new teams joined for 2010, bringing WPS to eight teams. However, the 2010 season saw considerable instability, with another charter team, Saint Louis Athletica, folding during the season, champions FC Gold Pride folding after the season, and the Chicago Red Stars deciding to regroup in the second-tier Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League (WPSL). The 2011 season, in which six teams based along the East Coast played, was marked by low attendance for most of the season and conflict with Dan Borislow, who had purchased the former Washington Freedom, moved the team to South Florida, and renamed it magicJack. The dispute between WPS and Borislow led the league to suspend the magicJack franchise, with Borislow responding by suing. The legal battle led WPS to suspend its 2012 season, with hopes of returning in 2013, but WPS soon decided to fold completely.

=====Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA), 2001–2003=====
The Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA) was founded in 2001. Headlined by the stars of the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup-winning team, $30 million was initially invested by numerous cable TV networks and owners. The league&#x27;s inaugural match was held between the Washington Freedom featuring Mia Hamm and the Bay Area CyberRays (featuring Brandi Chastain) at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. In addition to the 34,148 fans in attendance being greater than any MLS game that weekend, the Turner Network Television (TNT) broadcast reached 393,087 households: more than two MLS games broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2. The league folded in 2003.

====Second division====

===== United Women&#x27;s Soccer (UWS), 2016-present =====
United Women&#x27;s Soccer (UWS) began play in May 2016 and as of 2020 features 30 teams in five conferences across the United States.

=====Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League (WPSL), 1997–present =====
Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League (WPSL), started in 1997, features over 115 teams across the United States and Canada (the largest women&#x27;s soccer league in the world as of 2020).

===== USL W League, 1995–2015, 2022–present =====
The USL W-League was a semi-professional league that ran from 1995 to 2015 and featured a mix of college students and international players. A second pre-professional league named the USL W League began play in May 2022 with 44 teams organized into seven regional divisions.

USL also plans to launch a professional league, the USL Super League, in 2024 with an application for first-division sanctioning.

==Controversies==

===Concussions===
In 2014, parents and former players filed a class action lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, FIFA, and other soccer organizations for failure to create policies that would prevent, evaluate and manage concussion injuries. Soccer is second only to American football in the number of concussion injuries per year.

===MLS relationship===
The USSF has been accused by representatives of the North American Soccer League, among others, of unfairly protecting MLS&#x27;s leading role in American professional soccer. Among their concerns is that the USSF benefits from financial dealings with MLS that it does not have with other leagues, giving it an apparent incentive to protect MLS from competition. This includes the contract that the USSF has with MLS&#x27;s Soccer United Marketing (SUM) subsidiary in which most USSF sponsorship, television licensing and royalty revenues (outside of its apparel deal with Nike, Inc.) are paid through SUM. The USSF reported $15,433,754 in revenues through the SUM relationship in its 2014 audited financial report.

In 2015, the NASL took issue with proposed USSF rule changes reportedly making it harder to gain co-equal &quot;Division 1&quot; status with MLS that would increase the NASL&#x27;s influence within the USSF as well as presumably allow more access to international competition and larger media and sponsorship contracts, calling the draft proposal &quot;...an anti-competitive bait and switch, with the purpose of entrenching MLS&#x27;s monopoly position at the very time when the NASL is threatening to become a significant competitor.&quot; Seats on the USSF&#x27;s Professional Council governing committee are also based proportionally on pyramid level, giving MLS more votes when choosing the two professional league representatives on the USSF&#x27;s board of directors. In 2015, those representatives are MLS Commissioner Don Garber and Alec Papadakis, CEO of the United Soccer League that announced an affiliation with MLS in 2015.

===International competitiveness===
High-profile international soccer figures including former USMNT Head Coach Jürgen Klinsmann, former LA Galaxy head coach and USMNT Head Coach Bruce Arena and Manchester City coach and former FIFA World Coach of the Year Pep Guardiola, have expressed beliefs that the top-down structure of soccer developed and managed by the USSF in the United States, including pressure to have the best American players in MLS rather than higher-quality leagues in other countries, is hampering the nation&#x27;s competitiveness in international soccer.

Conversely, Klinsmann has been criticized in turn by MLS representatives for recommending that American players leave MLS development systems to pursue professional careers in Europe in order to test themselves against higher levels of players in preparation for international competition. In 2015, MLS Commissioner Don Garber said, &quot;I do believe our national team coach has a short-term objective. That&#x27;s what he&#x27;s hired to do. That doesn&#x27;t mean next week, but it&#x27;s to win the Gold Cup, it&#x27;s to have the best possible team in 2018. And our goals and objectives are broader than that, and that&#x27;s why we agree on some things but don&#x27;t agree on others.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s national team lawsuit===
On March 8, 2019, all members of the U.S. women&#x27;s national team collectively filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation in a district court in Los Angeles. The lawsuit was filed due to claims that the athletes were being treated differently on the basis of gender, affecting their paychecks, the facilities they were offered, and even the medical treatment they received. Women on the team have previously filed complaints about pay disparity, including in 2016 when five members of the women&#x27;s team filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

On May 1, 2020, the district court dismissed the team&#x27;s unequal and discriminatory pay claim, however preserving the players&#x27; claims about unequal treatment in areas like travel, hotel accommodations and team staffing. A trial on those issues is scheduled to begin June 16.

Judge R. Gary Klausner of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, granted the federation&#x27;s motion for summary judgment. In his ruling, he dismissed the players&#x27; arguments that they were systematically underpaid by U.S. Soccer in comparison with the men&#x27;s national team. According to Klausner, U.S. Soccer had substantiated its argument that the women&#x27;s team had actually earned more &quot;on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis&quot; than the men&#x27;s team during the years at issue in the lawsuit.

On February 22, 2022, the U.S. Soccer Federation agreed settle the lawsuit for $24 million, with a proposed $22 million going the players in the case and an additional $2 million to benefit USWNT players post-career goals and also charitable efforts related to women&#x27;s soccer. The settlement also requires both male and female soccer players to paid equally for friendlies, and tournaments including the World Cup.

U.S. Soccer became the first national governing body for the sport in the world to equalize World Cup prize money for its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. FIFA still distributes significantly more funds to its member associations for the men&#x27;s event.

==Reports==

===Garcia Report===

On July 17, 2012, in the wake of announced anti-corruption reforms by Sepp Blatter, the president of the world soccer governing body FIFA, the organization appointed U.S. lawyer Michael J. Garcia as the chairman of the investigative chamber of FIFA Ethics Committee, while German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was appointed as the chairman of the Ethics Committee&#x27;s adjudication chamber.

In August 2012, Garcia declared his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to respectively award the right to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup to Russia and Qatar by the FIFA Executive Committee. Garcia delivered his subsequent 350-page report in September 2014, and Eckert then announced that it would not be made public for legal reasons.

On November 13, 2014, Eckert released a 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing Garcia&#x27;s report. The summary cleared both Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, leaving Russia and Qatar free to stage their respective World Cups.

FIFA welcomed &quot;the fact that a degree of closure has been reached,&quot; while the Associated Press wrote that the Eckert summary &quot;was denounced by critics as a .&quot; Hours after the Eckert summary was released, Garcia himself criticized it for being &quot;materially incomplete&quot; with &quot;erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions,&quot; while declaring his intention to appeal to FIFA&#x27;s Appeal Committee. On December 16, 2014, FIFA&#x27;s Appeal Committee dismissed Garcia&#x27;s appeal against the Eckert summary as &quot;not admissible.&quot; FIFA also stated that Eckert&#x27;s summary was &quot;neither legally binding nor appealable.&quot; A day later, Garcia resigned from his role as FIFA ethics investigator in protest of FIFA&#x27;s conduct, citing a &quot;lack of leadership&quot; and lost confidence in the independence of Eckert from FIFA.

In June 2015, Swiss authorities claimed the report was of &quot;little value&quot;.

===Yates Report===

<doc id="186855" wikidata="Q2245260" url="?curid=186855" title="Christianity and Islam">
<text>Christianity and Islam are the two largest religions in the world, with approximately 2.3 billion and 1.8 billion adherents, respectively. Both religions are Abrahamic and monotheistic, having originated in the Middle East.

Christianity developed out of Second Temple Judaism in the 1st century CE. It is founded on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and those who follow it are called Christians. Islam developed in the 7th century CE. It is founded on the teachings of Muhammad, as an expression of surrendering to the will of God. Those who follow it are called Muslims (meaning &quot;submitters to God&quot;).

Muslims view Christians to be People of the Book, and also regard them as kafirs (unbelievers) committing shirk (polytheism) because of the Trinity, and thus, contend that they must be dhimmis (religious taxpayers) under Sharia law. Christians similarly possess a wide range of views about Islam. The majority of Christians view Islam as a false religion because its adherents reject the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ.

Like Christianity, Islam considers Jesus to be &quot;al-Masih&quot; (Arabic for the Messiah) who was sent to guide the Banī Isrā&#x27;īl (Arabic for Children of Israel) with a new revelation: &quot;al-Injīl&quot; (Arabic for &quot;the Gospel&quot;). But while belief in Jesus is a fundamental tenet of both, a critical distinction far more central to most Christian faiths is that Jesus is the incarnated God, specifically, one of the hypostases of the Triune God, God the Son.

While Christianity and Islam hold their recollections of Jesus&#x27;s teachings as gospel and share narratives from the first five books of the Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible), the sacred text of Christianity also includes the later additions to the Bible while the primary sacred text of Islam instead is the Quran. Muslims believe that &quot;al-Injīl&quot; was distorted or altered to form the Christian New Testament. Christians, on the contrary, do not have a univocal understanding of the Quran, though most believe that it is fabricated or apocryphal work. There are similarities in both texts, such as accounts of the life and works of Jesus and the virgin birth of Jesus through Mary; yet still, some Biblical and Quranic accounts of these events differ.

==Similarities and differences==
In the Islamic tradition, Christians and Jews are believed to worship the same God that Muslims worship. However, to some, there are many different opinions in the discussion of whether Muslims and Christians worship the same God.

===Scriptures===
The Christian Bible is made up of the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament was written over a period of two millennia prior to the birth of Christ. The New Testament was written in the decades following the death of Christ. Historically, Christians universally believed that the entire Bible was the divinely inspired Word of God. However, the rise of harsher criticism during the Enlightenment has led to a diversity of views concerning the authority and inerrancy of the Bible in different denominations. Christians consider the Quran to be a non-divine set of texts.

The Quran dates from the early 7th century or decades thereafter. Muslims believe it was revealed to Muhammad, gradually over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death. The Quran is written mostly in parabolically and not in form of a linear process of history. However, the stories often involve Biblical figures. By that, the Quran assumes that the audience is familiar with their associated narratives. Sometimes, stories featuring in the Bible are summarized, dwelled at length, and sometimes entirely different. Another difference in style is that the Bible offers a linear set of time, from the beginning of the narrative to its end, while the Quran implies a cyclical pattern, in which the main narrative of the Quran unfolds repeatedly at the time of each prophet.

Muslims believe that Jesus was given the Injil (Greek &quot;evangel&quot;, or &quot;Gospel&quot;) by God, however that parts or the entirety of these teachings were lost or distorted (&quot;tahrif&quot;) to produce the Hebrew Bible and the Christian New Testament. The majority of Muslims consider the Quran to be the only revealed book that has been protected by God from distortion or corruption.

===Jesus===

Muslims and Christians both believe that Jesus was born to Mary, a virgin. They both also believe that Jesus is the Messiah. However, they differ on other key issues regarding Jesus. Almost all Christians believe that Jesus was the incarnated Son of God, divine, and sinless. Islam teaches that Jesus was the penultimate and one of the most important prophets of God, but not the Son of God, not divine, and not part of the Trinity. Rather, Muslims believe the creation of Jesus was similar to the creation of Adam (Adem).

Christianity and Islam also differ in their fundamental views related to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Christianity teaches that Jesus was condemned to death by the Sanhedrin and the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate, crucified, and after three days, resurrected. Islam teaches that Jesus was a human prophet who, like the other prophets, tried to bring his people to worship the one true God, termed &quot;Tawhid&quot;. Muslims also believe that Jesus was condemned to crucifixion and then miraculously saved from execution, and was raised to the heavens. In Islam, instead of Jesus being crucified, his lookalike was crucified.

Both Christians and Muslims believe in the Second Coming of Jesus. Christianity does not state where will Jesus return, while the Hadith in Islam states that Jesus will return at a white minaret at the east of Damascus (believed to be the Minaret of Isa in the Umayyad Mosque), and will pray behind Mahdi. Christians believe that Jesus will return to kill the Antichrist and similarly Muslims believe that Jesus will return to kill Dajjal. Many Christians believe that Jesus would then rule for 1,000 years, while Muslims believe Jesus will rule for forty years, marry, have children and will be buried at the Green Dome.

===Muhammad===

Muslims believe that Muhammad was a prophet who received revelations (Quran) by God through the angel Gabriel (&quot;Jibril&quot;), gradually over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Muhammad, a proof of his prophethood.

Muslims revere Muhammad as the embodiment of the perfect believer and take his actions and sayings as a model of ideal conduct. Unlike Jesus, who Christians believe was God&#x27;s son, Muhammad was a mortal, albeit with extraordinary qualities. Today many Muslims believe that it is wrong to represent Muhammad, but this was not always the case. At various times and places pious Muslims represented Muhammad although they never worshiped these images.

During the lifetime of Muhammad, he had many interactions with Christians. One of the first Christians who met Muhammad was Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a Christian priest of ancient Arabia. He was one of the first &quot;hanifs&quot; to believe in the prophecy of Muhammad. Muhammad also met the Najrani Christians and made peace with them. One of the earliest recorded comments of a Christian reaction to Muhammad can be dated to only a few years after Muhammad&#x27;s death. As stories of the Arab prophet spread to Christian Syria, an old man who was asked about the &quot;prophet who has appeared with the Saracens&quot; responded: &quot;He is false, for the prophets do not come armed with a sword.&quot;

===God===

In Christianity, the most common name of God is Yahweh. In Islam, the most common name of God is Allah, similar to Eloah in the Old Testament. The vast majority of the world&#x27;s Christians adhere to the doctrine of the Trinity, which in creedal formulations states that God is three &quot;hypostases&quot; (the Father, the Son and the Spirit) in one &quot;ousia&quot; (substance). In Islam, this concept is deemed to be a denial of monotheism, and thus a sin of shirk, which is considered to be a major &#x27;al-Kaba&#x27;ir&#x27; sin. The Quran itself refers to Trinity in Al-Ma&#x27;ida 5:73 which says &quot;&quot;They have certainly disbelieved who say, &quot;Allah is the third of three.&quot; And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment&quot;.&quot; Islam has the concept of Tawhid which is the concept of a single, indivisible God, who has no partners.

===The Holy Spirit===

Christians and Muslims have differing views about the Holy Spirit. Most Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is God, and the third member of the Trinity. In Islam, the Holy Spirit is generally believed to be the angel Gabriel. Most Christians believe that the Paraclete referred to in the Gospel of John, who was manifested on the day of Pentecost, is the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, some Islamic scholars believe that the reference to the Paraclete is a prophecy of the coming of Muhammad.

One of the key verses concerning the Paraclete is John 16:7:
=== Salvation ===

The Catechism of the Catholic Church, the official doctrine document released by the Roman Catholic Church, has this to say regarding Muslims:
Protestant theology mostly emphasizes the necessity of faith in Jesus as a savior for salvation. Muslims may receive salvation in theologies relating to Universal reconciliation, but will not according to most Protestant theologies based on justification through faith:
Some modern Muslim scholars critique the doctrinal aspects of Christianity. For example, Isma&#x27;il Raji al-Faruqi, in his work &quot;Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas&quot;, argues that Christianity has incorporated various influences that diverge from Jesus&#x27; original teachings. He emphasizes the need for what he considers a rational and coherent ethical framework, contrasting Christian concepts like peccatism (inherent human sinfulness) and saviorism (belief in Jesus as the redeemer) with Islamic views. This perspective includes a critique of Christian theological paradoxes and advocates for a rational and coherent ethical framework.

The Quran explicitly promises salvation for all those righteous Christians who were there before the arrival of Muhammad:
The Quran also makes it clear that Christians will be nearest in love to those who follow the Quran and praises Christians for being humble and wise:
==Early and Medieval Christian writers on Islam and Muhammad==

===John of Damascus===
In 746, John of Damascus (sometimes St. John of Damascus) wrote the &quot;Fount of Knowledge&quot; part two of which is entitled &quot;Heresies in Epitome: How They Began and Whence They Drew Their Origin&quot;. In this work, John makes extensive reference to the Quran and, in John&#x27;s opinion, its failure to live up to even the most basic scrutiny. The work is not exclusively concerned with the &quot;Ismaelites&quot; (a name for the Muslims as they claimed to have descended from Ismael) but all heresy. The &quot;Fount of Knowledge&quot; references several suras directly often with apparent incredulity.

===Theophanes the Confessor===
Theophanes the Confessor (died c.822) wrote a series of chronicles (284 onwards and 602–813 AD) based initially on those of the better known George Syncellus. Theophanes reports about Muhammad thus:


===Niketas===
In the work &quot;A History of Christian-Muslim Relations,&quot; Hugh Goddard mentions both John of Damascus and Theophanes and goes on to consider the relevance of Niketas Byzantios who formulated replies to letters on behalf of Emperor Michael III (842-867). Goddard sums up Niketas&#x27; view:
Goddard further argues that Niketas demonstrates in his work a knowledge of the entire Quran, including an extensive knowledge of Suras 2–18. Niketas&#x27; account from behind the Byzantine frontier apparently set a strong precedent for later writing both in tone and points of argument.

===11th century===
Knowledge and depictions of Islam continued to be varied within the Christian West during the 11th century. For instance, the author(s) of the 11th century &quot;Song of Roland&quot; evidently had little actual knowledge of Islam. As depicted in this epic poem, Muslims erect statues of Mohammed and worship them, and Mohammed is part of an &quot;Unholy Trinity&quot; together with the Classical Greek Apollyon and Termagant, a completely fictional deity. This view, evidently confusing Islam with the pre-Christian Graeco-Roman Religion, appears to reflect misconceptions prevalent in Western Christian society at the time.

On the other hand, ecclesiastic writers such as Amatus of Montecassino or Geoffrey Malaterra in Norman Southern Italy, who occasionally lived among Muslims themselves, would depict at times Muslims in a negative way but would depict equally any other (ethnic) group that was opposed to the Norman rule such as Byzantine Greeks or Italian Lombards. Often the depictions would depend on context: when writing about neutral events, Muslims would be called according to geographical terms such as &quot;Saracens&quot; or &quot;Sicilians, when reporting events where Muslims came into conflict with Normans, Muslims would be called &quot;pagans&quot; or &quot;infidels&quot;.

Similarities were occasionally acknowledged such as by Pope Gregory VII wrote in a letter to the Hammadid emir an-Nasir that both Christians and Muslims &quot;worship and confess the same God though in diverse forms and daily praise&quot;.

===&quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;===
In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Muhammad is in the ninth ditch of Malebolge, the eighth realm, designed for those who have caused schism; specifically, he was placed among the Sowers of Religious Discord. Muhammad is portrayed as split in half, with his entrails hanging out, representing his status as a heresiarch (Canto 28).

This scene is frequently shown in illustrations of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century fresco &quot;Last Judgment&quot; by Giovanni da Modena and drawing on Dante, in the San Petronio Basilica in Bologna, as well as in artwork by Salvador Dalí, Auguste Rodin, William Blake, and Gustave Doré.

==Catholic Church and Islam==
===Second Vatican Council and &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;===
The question of Islam was not on the agenda when &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; was first drafted, or even at the opening of the Second Vatican Council. However, as in the case of the question of Judaism, several events came together again to prompt a consideration of Islam. By the time of the Second Session of the Council in 1963, reservations began to be raised by bishops of the Middle East about the inclusion of this question. The position was taken that either the question will not be raised at all, or if it were raised, some mention of the Muslims should be made. Melkite patriarch Maximos IV was among those pushing for this latter position.

Early in 1964, Cardinal Bea notified Cardinal Cicognani, President of the Council&#x27;s Coordinating Commission, that the Council fathers wanted the Council to say something about the great monotheistic religions, and in particular about Islam. The subject, however, was deemed to be outside the competence of Bea&#x27;s Secretariat for the Promotion of Christian Unity. Bea expressed willingness to &quot;select some competent people and with them to draw up a draft&quot; to be presented to the Coordinating Commission. At a meeting of the Coordinating Commission on 16–17 April Cicognani acknowledged that it would be necessary to speak of the Muslims.

The period between the first and second sessions saw the change of pontiff from Pope John XXIII to Pope Paul VI, who had been a member of the circle (the &quot;Badaliya&quot;) of the Islamologist Louis Massignon. Pope Paul VI chose to follow the path recommended by Maximos IV and he therefore established commissions to introduce what would become paragraphs on the Muslims in two different documents, one of them being &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;, paragraph three, the other being &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;, paragraph 16.

The text of the final draft bore traces of Massignon&#x27;s influence. The reference to Mary, for example, resulted from the intervention of Monsignor Descuffi, the Latin archbishop of Smyrna with whom Massignon collaborated in reviving the cult of Mary at Smyrna. The commendation of Muslim prayer may reflect the influence of the Badaliya.

In &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;, the Second Vatican Council declares that the plan of salvation also includes Muslims, due to their professed monotheism.

==Protestantism and Islam==

Protestantism and Islam entered into contact during the 16th century, at a time when Protestant movements in northern Europe coincided with the expansion of the Ottoman Empire in southern Europe. As both were in conflict with the Catholic Holy Roman Empire, numerous exchanges occurred, exploring religious similarities and the possibility of trade and military alliances. Relations became more conflictual in the early modern and modern periods, although recent attempts have been made at rapprochement.

==Mormonism and Islam==

Mormonism and Islam have been compared to one another ever since the earliest origins of the former in the nineteenth century, often by detractors of one religion or the other—or both. For instance, Joseph Smith, the founding prophet of Mormonism, was referred to as &quot;the modern Mahomet&quot; by the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, shortly after his murder in June 1844. This epithet repeated a comparison that had been made from Smith&#x27;s earliest career, one that was not intended at the time to be complimentary. Comparison of the Mormon and Muslim prophets still occurs today, sometimes for derogatory or polemical reasons but also for more scholarly and neutral purposes. While Mormonism and Islam certainly have many similarities, there are also significant, fundamental differences between the two religions. Mormon-Muslim relations have historically been cordial; recent years have seen increasing dialogue between adherents of the two faiths, and cooperation in charitable endeavors, especially in the Middle and Far East.

==Cultural influences==
Scholars and intellectuals agree Christians have made significant contributions to Arab and Islamic civilization since the introduction of Islam, and they have had a significant impact contributing the culture of the Middle East and North Africa and other areas. Eastern Christian scientists and scholars of the medieval Islamic world (particularly Nestorian Christians) contributed to the Arab Islamic civilization during the Ummayads and the Abbasids periods by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. They also excelled in philosophy, science, theology and medicine. Byzantine science played an important and crucial role in the transmission of classical knowledge to the Islamic world.

During the High Middle Ages, the Islamic world was at its cultural peak, supplying information and ideas to Europe, via Al-Andalus, Sicily and the Crusader kingdoms in the Levant. These included Latin translations of the Greek Classics and of Arabic texts in astronomy, mathematics, science, and medicine. Translation of Arabic philosophical texts into Latin &quot;led to the transformation of almost all philosophical disciplines in the medieval Latin world&quot;, with a particularly strong influence of Muslim philosophers being felt in natural philosophy, psychology and metaphysics. The Islamic world also influenced other aspects of medieval European culture, partly by original innovations made during the Islamic Golden Age, including various fields such as the arts, agriculture, alchemy, music, pottery, etc.

===Artistic influences ===

Islamic art and culture have both influenced and been influenced by Christian art and culture. Some arts have received such influence strongly, particularly religious architecture in the Byzantine and medieval eras.

<text>The Omen is a 1976 supernatural horror film directed by Richard Donner and written by David Seltzer. An international co-production of the United Kingdom and the United States, it stars Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Harvey Spencer Stephens (in his film debut), Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Troughton, Martin Benson, and Leo McKern. The film&#x27;s plot follows Damien Thorn, a young child replaced at birth by his father, unbeknownst to his wife, after their biological child dies shortly after birth. As a series of mysterious events and violent deaths occur around the family and Damien enters childhood, they come to learn he is in fact the prophesied Antichrist.

Released theatrically by 20th Century-Fox in June 1976, &quot;The Omen&quot; received mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, grossing over $60 million at the U.S. box office and becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1976. Retrospective reviews of the film have been more favorable, and the film earned two Oscar nominations, including a win for Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s musical score. The film spawned the &quot;Omen&quot; franchise, with &quot;Damien - Omen II&quot; released two years later, followed by &quot;The Final Conflict&quot; (1981) and &quot;Omen IV: The Awakening&quot; (1991), as well as a 2006 remake and 2024 prequel. It also spawned a 2016 television series that ran for one season on A&amp;E.

== Plot ==
American diplomat Robert Thorn and his wife Katherine are living in Rome, where Katherine gives birth to a boy whom Robert is told died immediately. Hospital chaplain Father Spiletto persuades Robert to secretly adopt another baby whose mother has just died in childbirth. Robert does not tell Katherine that the child is not their own. They name him Damien.

Five years later, Robert is Ambassador to the United Kingdom in London when mysterious phenomena begin to plague the Thorns: a menacing Rottweiler appears at their home, Damien&#x27;s nanny publicly hangs herself during his fifth birthday party, a new nanny named Mrs. Baylock arrives unexpectedly, Damien violently resists entering a church, and animals at a safari park are terrified by his presence. Father Brennan warns Robert about Damien&#x27;s origins, hinting that he is not human and insisting Robert take Holy Communion. He tells Robert that Damien is the son of Satan, that Katherine is pregnant, and that Damien will kill his unborn sibling and parents. Later, Father Brennan is killed by a falling lightning rod. Katherine tells Robert she wants an abortion, which he opposes. Damien knocks Katherine over a railing to the floor below, injuring her and causing her to miscarry.

Photographer Keith Jennings notices shadows in photographs of the nanny and Father Brennan that presage their deaths. Keith shows Robert the photos along with news clippings and Biblical passages from Father Brennan suggesting the coming of the Antichrist. He accompanies Robert to Rome to investigate Damien&#x27;s birth. They learn that a fire destroyed the hospital, including Katherine&#x27;s maternity records, and killed the staff on duty. They find Father Spiletto in a monastery, severely burned, mute, blind in one eye, and partially paralyzed. He directs them to the cemetery where Damien&#x27;s biological mother is buried. In the grave of Damien&#x27;s mother, Robert and Keith find a jackal carcass and, in the next plot, a child&#x27;s skeleton with a shattered skull. Robert realizes that the child was his own son, murdered so that Damien could take his place. A pack of Rottweilers drives Robert and Keith from the cemetery.

Robert calls Katherine in the hospital to tell her that she must leave London. Before she can do so, Mrs. Baylock throws Katherine to her death from the window of her room. Robert and Keith befriend Antichrist exorcism expert Carl Bugenhagen in Israel, who says that if Damien is the true Antichrist, he will bear a birthmark in the shape of three sixes. Carl gives Robert seven daggers with which to kill Damien on hallowed ground. Robert refuses to do so, but Keith remains convinced of its necessity. Shortly afterward, Keith is decapitated by a sheet of glass from a truck. Enraged, Robert reluctantly accepts his task.

Robert finds the birthmark on the sleeping Damien&#x27;s scalp and is attacked by Mrs. Baylock, whom he fatally stabs. Armed with the daggers, Robert drives Damien to a local cathedral. His erratic driving draws the attention of the police. Robert drags a screaming Damien onto the altar to kill him and begs God to forgive him, but the police arrive on the scene and shoot him as he brandishes the dagger.

The double funeral is attended by the U.S. President and the First Lady. As the camera pans out, it is revealed that the funeral is Robert&#x27;s and Katherine&#x27;s. Meanwhile, Damien, standing with the first couple, turns and smiles at the camera.

=== Development ===
According to producer Harvey Bernhard, the idea of a motion picture about the Antichrist came after a discussion about the Bible with Bob Munger, a friend of Bernhard&#x27;s. When Munger told him about the idea in 1973, the producer immediately contacted screenwriter David Seltzer and hired him to write a screenplay. It took a year for Seltzer to write the script.

The film was considered by Warner Bros. Pictures, but the project did not move forward until optioned by Alan Ladd Jr. of 20th Century Fox. Seltzer and Donner differed over the film&#x27;s message. Donner favored an ambiguous reading of the script under which it would be left for the audience to decide whether Damien was the Antichrist or whether the series of violent deaths in the film were all just a string of unfortunate accidents. Seltzer rejected the ambiguity favored by Donner and pressed for an interpretation of his script that left no doubt for the audience that Damien Thorn was the Antichrist and that all of the deaths in the film were caused by the malevolent power of Satan, the interpretation that Bernhard chose to go with.

=== Casting ===
Bernhard claims Gregory Peck had been the choice to portray Ambassador Thorn from the beginning. Peck got involved with the project through his agent, who was friends with producer Bernhard. After reading the script, Peck reportedly liked the idea that it was more of a psychological thriller rather than a horror film and agreed to star in it. He was at first displeased with the props and effects for making the death scenes but was relieved to find how restrained and non-exploitative they were in the final film.

Despite Bernhard&#x27;s claim, there were other actors considered for the role because studios were reluctant to cast Peck as a child killer. Warner Bros. Pictures thought the role would be ideal for Oliver Reed. William Holden had also been approached for the role, but turned it down, claiming he did not want to star in a film about the devil. Holden would later portray Thorn&#x27;s brother, Richard, in the sequel, &quot;&quot; (1978). A firm offer was made to Charlton Heston on July 19, 1975. He turned down the part on July 27, not wanting to spend an entire winter alone in Europe and also concerned that the film might have an exploitative feel if not handled carefully. Roy Scheider, Dick Van Dyke, and Charles Bronson were also considered for the role of Robert Thorn. Van Dyke turned down the role because of the violence and gore; he would later call the decision &quot;stupid&quot;.

According to separate interviews with Donner and Harvey Stephens, over 500 boys had auditioned for the role of Damien. The then four-year-old Stephens won the role after Donner encouraged the boys to attack him during a group audition, following which Stephens reportedly clawed at Donner&#x27;s face and kicked him in the groin. Because Stephens had curly blonde hair, Donner had Stephens&#x27; hair straightened and dyed black, and gave him colored contacts to make him look scarier.

=== Casting and Production Challenges ===
Harvey Stephens&#x27; Audition: The role of young Damien was secured by Harvey Stephens after an audition where director Richard Donner encouraged the child actors to attack him. Stephens impressed Donner by clawing at his face and delivering a swift kick to his groin. 

Title Changes: Initially, the film underwent title changes from &quot;The Antichrist&quot; to &quot;The Birthmark&quot; before settling on The Omen. 

=== Unforeseen Incidents ===
IRA Bombing Near Director: Director Richard Donner narrowly escaped an IRA bombing at the hotel he was staying in during production. 

Rottweiler Attack: A trained Rottweiler unexpectedly turned on its handler during filming, causing injuries. 

Zoo Tragedy: Following the filming of a scene involving baboons at Windsor Zoo, a zookeeper was attacked and killed by a lion the next day. 

=== Financial and Critical Success ===
Despite these challenges, The Omen was both a critical and commercial success. Produced on a budget of $2.8 million, the film grossed over $60 million in the United States. This success is partly attributed to Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s iconic score, which earned him an Academy Award. 

These lesser-known facts underscore the tumultuous yet triumphant journey of The Omen, adding to its legacy as a film that transcended its ominous production experiences.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography of &quot;The Omen&quot; began on October 6, 1975, and lasted eleven weeks, wrapping on January 9, 1976. Scenes were shot on location in Bishops Park in Fulham, London and Guildford Cathedral in Surrey. The Thorns&#x27; country manor was filmed at Pyrford Court in Surrey. The church featured in the Bishop&#x27;s Park neighbourhood is All Saints&#x27; Church, Fulham, on the western side of Putney Bridge Road. The church used in the final climactic scene is St Peter&#x27;s in Staines-upon-Thames. Additional photography took place at Shepperton Studios outside London, as well as on location in Jerusalem and Rome.

For the scene where Katherine&#x27;s car is attacked by baboons, production initially tried to have the baboons attack by placing food around the car (after having the zoo staff members deliberately not feed the baboons the night before filming), whilst also placing a baby baboon in the back seat of the car with a zoo official. After it failed to earn the desired effect, the official swapped out the baby baboon for the alpha baboon, which got the baboons to attack the car. According to Richard Donner, Lee Remick&#x27;s terror during the scene was authentic.

== Analysis ==
American scholar Brad Duren argued that &quot;The Omen&quot; was part of a trend of films featuring cosmic horror that started with &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; in 1968, but the film was unusual at the time because it concerned the &quot;end times&quot; predicted in &quot;The Book of Revelation&quot; and focused on a form of premillennialism favored by American dispensationalists. Duren further maintained that the box office success of &quot;The Omen&quot;, which concerned the first stages of the Apocalypse as the Antichrist is born, reflected the &quot;zeitgeist&quot; of 1970s America.

In 1973, an advertising executive and evangelical Christian, Robert Munger, who had read Hal Lindsey&#x27;s book &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;, speculated to film producer Harvey Bernard about the possibility that the Antichrist might be walking the earth in the form of a child, unknown to the vast majority of humanity. This conversation inspired Bernard with the idea for the film that became &quot;The Omen&quot;. Bernard commissioned scriptwriter David Seltzer to write a script for the film. Seltzer in turn borrowed many ideas from dispensationalism, especially &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;, while also inventing his own. For an example, a supposed quote from the &quot;Book of Revelation&quot; featured in &quot;The Omen&quot; (&quot;When the Jews return to Zion and a comet rips the sky and the Holy Roman Empire rises, then you and I must die; from the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother, &#x27;til man exists no more&quot;) is not in fact in that book. Likewise, the sinister figure who will rule the world for seven years predicted in &quot;Revelation&quot;, commonly known as the Antichrist, is not described in the Bible as the son of Satan, whereas Satan is the father of the Antichrist in &quot;The Omen&quot;.

Jim Knipfel in &quot;The Omen: The Pedigree of a Horror Classic&quot; on &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, opines of &quot;The Omen&quot;:&quot;[T]here is no single source quite as central and clearly influential as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Platform&quot;, a 1974 episode from the first season of &quot;&quot;, with stars Tom Skerritt (credited as &quot;Tom Skerrit&quot;) as Robert Palmer, a young politician whose meteoric rise seemed to come out of nowhere. He seems a shoo-in to become the new state senator from Illinois, but is already gunning for the White House. ...Palmer is rising quickly in the world of politics, which of course was the subtext of the entire &quot;Omen&quot; franchise. Anyone who threatens his rise or stands in his way — major political donors, speechwriters for the opposing candidate, even the opposing candidate himself — ends up dying mysteriously as the result of a tragic and freakish accident, which was the hook that brought most people to the theaters to see the &quot;Omen&quot; films in the first place. ...Palmer, again like Damien, also has a very protective Rottweiler familiar, who is impervious to harm. ... Like David Warner&#x27;s photographer in the first film, inexplicable photographic anomalies help point Kolchak in the right direction. ... And finally, in the end the ambitious Satanic candidate is dispatched with a holy instrument (blessed daggers in &quot;The Final Conflict&quot;, holy water in &quot;The Night Stalker&quot;). So there. In a way, watching &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Platform&quot; is a bit like watching all three &quot;Omen&quot; films from an outsider journalist&#x27;s perspective, except Kolchak is able to wrap the whole thing up neatly in an hour.&quot;
The success of the film in 1976 may have been due to a sense of malaise in the West at the time. As film critic John Kenneth Muir wrote: &quot;What if the Bible is correct? What if all the signs of the Apocalypse are happening around about now? Would we believe them? Heck, would we even notice?&quot; Duren wrote that, although it was unlikely that most people who viewed the film in 1976 accepted the dispensationalist viewpoint, the mere feeling that the world or the West was in terminal decline gave the film a resonance that its subsequent sequels lacked.
Beyond the success of the film, Duren wrote that the impact of the film on popular culture can be seen in the way that many people accept the dispensationalist reading of the Book of Revelation as the correct interpretation whereas in fact, the dispensationalist interpretation was and still is rejected by many churches. Duren wrote that dispensationalism had once been a &quot;fringe&quot; theory within Protestant theology, but due to the popularity of &quot;The Omen&quot; it is now widely accepted as doctrine.

Duren notes that in the film it has to be explained to Robert Thorn that the number 666 is the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; and speculates that audiences in 1976 were not familiar with this aspect of the &quot;Book of Revelation&quot;, but because of the film&#x27;s popularity, the number 666 has entered popular culture and most people, even those of a secular bent, are aware of the sinister significance attached to the number.

== Music ==

An original score for the film, including the movie&#x27;s theme song &quot;Ave Satani&quot;, was composed by Jerry Goldsmith, for which he received the only Oscar of his career. The score features a strong choral segment, with a foreboding Latin chant. According to Goldsmith&#x27;s wife, Carol, the composer initially struggled with ideas for the score until one evening when he suddenly, happily announced to her, &quot;I hear voices&quot;, referring to an orchestral chorus or choir. The Latin of this song contains some errors: &quot;We drink the blood&quot; must be &quot;Sanguinem bibimus&quot; (accusative form of &quot;sanguis&quot;), also &quot;Hail Satan!&quot; is &quot;Ave Satana&quot; (vocative form), and as for &quot;Ave Versus Christus&quot; is nonsense in Latin: the correct form is &quot;Ave Antichriste&quot; (vocative form of &quot;Antichristus&quot;, the Latin name for the Biblical Antichrist).

== Release ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Omen&quot; was released following a successful $2.8 million marketing campaign inspired by the one from &quot;Jaws&quot; one year prior, with two weeks of sneak previews, a novelization by screenwriter David Seltzer, and the logo with &quot;666&quot; inside the film&#x27;s title as the centerpiece of the advertisement. An early screening of the film took place in numerous U.S. cities on June 6, 1976.

The film was a massive commercial success, opening in the United States and Canada on June 25, 1976, in 516 theaters. It grossed $4,273,886 in its opening weekend (a then-record for Fox) and $60,922,980 in total, ($334,414,696 in 2024,) generating theatrical rentals of $28.5 million in the United States and Canada. Worldwide it earned rentals of $46.3 million from a budget of $2.8 million. In the United States, the film was the sixth-highest-grossing movie of 1976.

During its release in South Africa under the apartheid regime, the Publication Approval Board cut the final scenes showing the killing of Robert Thorn and Damien&#x27;s survival.

=== Critical response ===
==== Contemporary ====
Richard Eder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a dreadfully silly film&quot; but &quot;reasonably well-paced. We don&#x27;t have time to brood about the sillinesses of any particular scene before we are on to the next. There is not a great deal of excitement, but we manage to sustain some curiosity as to how things will work out.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised Richard Donner&#x27;s direction as &quot;taut&quot; and the performances as &quot;strong&quot;, and noted that the script, &quot;sometimes too expository, too predictable, too contrived, is nonetheless a good connective fibre.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also awarded 2.5 stars out of 4, lauding the &quot;firepower sound track&quot; and several &quot;memorable&quot; scenes, but finding the story &quot;goofy.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;an absolutely riveting, thoroughly scary experience, a triumph of sleek film craftsmanship that will inevitably but not necessarily unfavorably be compared to &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.&quot; Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared, &quot;It&#x27;s probably the classiest &quot;Exorcist&quot; copy yet, but as a summer thriller, it can hardly challenge the human appeal and exhilarating impact of last year&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot; ... Seltzer, busy justifying his baloney premise with Biblical quotations, forgets about narrative logic or empathetic characters.&quot;

Gene Shalit called the film &quot;a piece of junk&quot;, and Judith Crist said it &quot;offers more laughs than the average comedy.&quot; Jack Kroll of &quot;Newsweek&quot; called it &quot;a dumb and largely dull movie.&quot; Duncan Leigh Cooper of &quot;Cineaste&quot; wrote, &quot;Despite its improbable story line and abundance of gratuitous violence, &quot;The Omen&quot; does succeed in its attempt to frighten, terrorize, and just plain scare the pants off most of the audience. Impressive performances ... plus a chilling mock-religious score by Jerry Goldsmith and the skillful direction of Richard Donner, all contribute to the suspension of disbelief required to draw the audience into the film&#x27;s web of terror.&quot; Richard Combs of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; described the movie as &quot;[a] matter-of-fact exercise in Satanic blood and thunder, both less grandiloquently and less pretentiously put together than &quot;The Exorcist&quot; ... In fact, the narrative is so straightforward, and so mundanely concerned with developing ever more ingenious ways, at a rapidly increasing clip, of disposing of its starry cast, that the spiritual torment is skimped.&quot;

==== Retrospective ====
In 1978, two years after its release, &quot;The Omen&quot; was included in Harry Medved and Harry Dreyfuss&#x27;s book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;. It was the most recent movie featured.

Retrospective reviews of the film have been more favorable. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 85% based on 53 reviews and an average rating of 7.20/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Omen&quot; eschews an excess of gore in favor of ramping up the suspense—and creates an enduring, dread-soaked horror classic along the way&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;The Omen&quot; was ranked number 81 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years... 100 Thrills&quot;, and the score by Jerry Goldsmith was nominated for AFI&#x27;s &quot;100 Years of Film Scores&quot;. The film was ranked #16 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;. Similarly, the Chicago Film Critics&#x27; Association named it the 31st-scariest film ever made. It has also been ranked as one of the best horror films of 1976 by Filmsite.org.

The film was criticized by the Catholic Church, which accused it of misrepresenting Christian eschatology. On the other hand, some Protestant groups praised the film, and the California Graduate School of Theology in Glendale presented the filmmakers with a special award during its 1977 commencement ceremonies.

==== Accolades ====
=== Home media ===
&quot;The Omen&quot; was released on VHS by 20th Century Fox Home Video in 1980. A VHS reissue was released by Fox under their &quot;Selection Series&quot; in 2000. The same year, a special-edition DVD was released by 20th Century Fox Home Video as a standalone release as well as in a four-film set that included its three sequels. A newly restored two-disc collector&#x27;s edition DVD of the film was issued in 2006, coinciding with the release of the remake.

The film had its debut on Blu-ray in October 2008 as part of a four-film collection, featuring the first two sequels—&quot;Damien: Omen II&quot; and &quot;The Final Conflict&quot;—as well as the 2006 remake. The fourth sequel, &quot;Omen: The Awakening&quot;, was not included in this set. On October 15, 2019, Scream Factory released a deluxe-edition box set—featuring the original film, along with all three sequels and the remake—and featuring newly commissioned bonus materials. The Scream Factory release features a new 4K restoration of the original film elements.

== Franchise ==
=== Films ===
A novelization of &quot;The Omen&quot; was written by screenwriter David Seltzer and released two weeks before the film. For the book, Seltzer augmented some plot points and character backgrounds and changed minor details, including some character names: Holly became Chessa Whyte, Keith Jennings became Haber Jennings and Father Brennan became Father Edgardo Emilio Tassone.

&quot;The Omen&quot; was followed by three sequels: &quot;Damien - Omen II&quot; (1978), &quot;Omen III: The Final Conflict&quot; (1981), and &quot;Omen IV: The Awakening&quot; (1991). A remake of the same title was released in 2006, starring Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles in the roles of Robert and Katherine, and Mia Farrow portraying Mrs. Baylock. A prequel to the first film titled &quot;The First Omen&quot; was released on April 5, 2024.

=== Television ===
==== &quot;The Omen&quot; (1995) ====
In 1995, a television pilot titled &quot;The Omen&quot; aired on NBC, on September 8 of that year. Directed by Jack Sholder, the hour-long episode was intended as an attempt to develop &quot;The Omen&quot; franchise into a TV series. Although Donner was attached to the project as an executive producer, the pilot failed and the series never moved forward. Unrelated to the previous films, &quot;The Omen&quot; follows a group of people who are tracking down an entity to which they are all independently linked.

==== &quot;Damien&quot; (2016) ====

A television series called &quot;Damien&quot; was in development at the network Lifetime before it was moved to A&amp;E with Bradley James starring in the title role. The series aired from March 7 to May 9, 2016. The series, acting as a direct sequel to the original film, follows 30-year-old Damien, who has forgotten his demonic past, facing his true identity. Ann Rutledge (Barbara Hershey), who has protected Damien all his life, helps him embrace his Antichrist side.

<text>List of United States Navy ships is a comprehensive listing of all ships that have been in service to the United States Navy during the history of that service. The US Navy maintains its official list of ships past and present at the Naval Vessel Register (NVR), although it does not include early vessels. The NVR &quot;US Navy Inactive Classification Symbols&quot; is a concise list of inactive definitions. The &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot; includes much detail on historical ships, and was used as the basis for many of Wikipedia&#x27;s ship articles.

Due to the large number of entries, this list has been divided into the lists to be found in the infobox:
* Ships in current service
* Ships grouped alphabetically by the first letter of the ship&#x27;s name
* Ships grouped by type

<text>Athens is a consolidated city-county in the U.S. state of Georgia. Downtown Athens lies about northeast of downtown Atlanta. The University of Georgia, the state&#x27;s flagship public university and an R1 research institution, is in Athens and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original City of Athens abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens–Clarke County where it is the county seat.

As of 2021, the Athens-Clarke County&#x27;s official website&#x27;s population of the consolidated city-county (all of Clarke County except Winterville and a portion of Bogart) was 128,711. Athens is the sixth-most populous city in Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens metropolitan area, which had a 2020 population of 215,415, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Metropolitan Athens is a component of the larger Atlanta–Athens–Clarke County–Sandy Springs Combined Statistical Area.

The city is dominated by a pervasive college town culture and music scene centered in downtown Athens, next to the University of Georgia&#x27;s North Campus. Major music acts associated with Athens include numerous alternative rock bands such as R.E.M., the B-52&#x27;s, Widespread Panic, Drive-By Truckers, of Montreal, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Harvey Milk. The city is also known as a recording site for such groups as the Atlanta-based Indigo Girls. The 2020 book &quot;Cool Town: How Athens, Georgia, Launched Alternative Music and Changed American Culture&quot; describes Athens as the model of the indie culture of the 1980s.

==History==

In the late 18th century, a trading settlement on the banks of the Oconee River called Cedar Shoals stood where Athens is today. On January 27, 1785, the Georgia General Assembly granted a charter by Abraham Baldwin for the University of Georgia as the first state-supported university. Georgia&#x27;s control of the area was established following the Oconee War. In 1801, a committee from the university&#x27;s board of trustees selected a site for the university on a hill above Cedar Shoals, in what was then Jackson County. On July 25, 1801, John Milledge, one of the trustees and later governor of Georgia, bought 633 acres from Daniel Easley and donated it to the university. Milledge named the surrounding area Athens after the city that was home to the Platonic Academy of Plato and Aristotle in Classical Greece.
 The first buildings on the University of Georgia campus were made from logs. The town grew as lots adjacent to the college were sold to raise money for the additional construction of the school. By the time the first class graduated from the university in 1804, Athens consisted of three homes, three stores, and a few other buildings facing Front Street, now known as Broad Street. Completed in 1806 and named in honor of Benjamin Franklin, Franklin College was the first permanent structure of the University of Georgia and the city of Athens. This brick building is now known as Old College.

Athens officially became a town in December 1806 with a government made up of a three-member commission. The university and town continued to grow with cotton mills fueling the industrial and commercial development. Athens became known as the &quot;Manchester of the South&quot; after the city in England known for its mills. In 1833, a group of Athens businessmen led by James Camak, tired of their wagons getting stuck in the mud, built one of Georgia&#x27;s first railroads, the Georgia, connecting Athens to Augusta by 1841, and to Marthasville (now Atlanta) by 1845. In the 1830s and 1840s, transportation developments and the growing influence of the University of Georgia made Athens one of the state&#x27;s most important cities as the Antebellum Period neared the height of its development. The university essentially created a chain reaction of growth in the community which developed on its doorstep.

During the American Civil War, Athens became a significant supply center when the New Orleans armory was relocated to what is now called the Chicopee building. Fortifications can still be found along parts of the North Oconee River between College Avenue and Oconee Street. In addition, Athens played a small part in the ill-fated &quot;Stoneman Raid&quot; when a skirmish was fought on a site overlooking the Middle Oconee River near what is now the old Macon Highway. A Confederate memorial that used to stand on Broad Street near the University of Georgia Arch was removed the week of August 10, 2020.

During Reconstruction, Athens continued to grow. The form of government changed to a mayor-council government with a new city charter on August 24, 1872, and Henry Beusse was elected as the first mayor of Athens. Beusse was instrumental in the city&#x27;s rapid growth after the Civil War. After serving as mayor, he worked in the railroad industry and helped bring railroads to the region, creating growth in many of the surrounding communities. Freed slaves moved to the city, where many were attracted by the new centers for education such as the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. This new population was served by three black newspapers: the &quot;Athens Blade&quot;, the &quot;Athens Clipper&quot;, and the &quot;Progressive Era&quot;.

In the 1880s, as Athens became more densely populated, city services and improvements were undertaken. The Athens Police Department was founded in 1881 and public schools opened in the fall of 1886. Telephone service was introduced in 1882 by the Bell Telephone Company. Transportation improvements were also introduced with a street paving program beginning in 1885 and streetcars, pulled by mules, in 1888.
By the centennial in 1901, Athens had experienced a century of development and growth. A new city hall was completed in 1904. An African-American middle class and the professional class grew around the corner of Washington and Hull Streets, known as the &quot;Hot Corner&quot;, where the Morton Building was constructed in 1910. The theater at the Morton Building hosted movies and performances by black musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, and Duke Ellington. In 1907, aviation pioneer Ben T. Epps became Georgia&#x27;s first pilot on a hill outside town that would become the Athens-Ben Epps Airport.

The last, and perhaps only, lynching in Athens occurred on February 16, 1921, when a mob of 3,000 people attacked the Athens courthouse and carried off John Lee Eberhart. Eberhart had been arrested for the murder of his employer, Ida D. Lee, with a shotgun in Oconee County. That night, he was driven back to the Lee farm where a mock trial was held. Though he refused to confess, he was tied to a stake and burned to death. The lynching received widespread attention.

During World War II, the U.S. Navy built new buildings and paved runways to serve as a training facility for naval pilots. In 1954, the U.S. Navy chose Athens as the site for the Navy Supply Corps school. The school was in Normaltown in the buildings of the old Normal School. It closed in 2011 under the Base Realignment and Closure process. The 56 acre site is now home to the Health Sciences Campus, which contains the University of Georgia/Medical College of Georgia Medical Partnership, the University of Georgia College of Public Health, and other health-related programs.

In 1961, Athens witnessed part of the civil rights movement when Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes became the first two black students to enter the University of Georgia. Despite the &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education&quot; Supreme Court ruling in 1954, the Athens–Clarke County school district remained segregated until 1964.

====Airports====
Athens-Ben Epps Airport (FAA code AHN) has been operational since 1917. It is east of downtown outside Georgia State Route 10 Loop and north of US Route 78. AHN qualifies for air service to be provided under the Essential Air Service provisions. SeaPort Airlines provides commercial air service to Nashville International Airport, TN. Until 2012, Georgia Skies and Wings Air provided commercial air service to Atlanta, and until 2008 (before either airline&#x27;s current AHN service), US Airways provided service to Charlotte. Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL) is the primary point of departure and arrival for Athenians due to the relative lack of air service to AHN.

====Alternative transportation====
Athens encourages the use of alternative transportation. Bike lanes are provided on major thoroughfares. A rail-to-trail redevelopment is being considered to connect Downtown with the East Side. Organizations such as BikeAthens support and encourage biking. Skateboarding and small scooters are also common sights around the UGA campus and Downtown.

The Georgia Hi–Lo Trail, established in 2024, will connect Athens to Savannah, Georgia, when completed.

Into the same period, the Central Railroad of Georgia ran mixed passenger and freight trains south to Macon&#x27;s Terminal Station.

Passenger service is proposed to return to Athens via a proposed route of the Charlotte to Atlanta segment of the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor. The alignment with a proposed station stop in Athens was chosen as this segment&#x27;s preferred alternative on September 30, 2020.

Freight service is provided by CSX and Athens Line, the latter having leased tracks from Norfolk Southern. The Georgia Department of Transportation has proposed the city as the terminus of a commuter line that links Atlanta and Gwinnett County along the Georgia 316 corridor.

The entire project is slated for 2022 completion.

St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital was founded in 1906 and became a Catholic hospital in 1938. The hospital became St. Mary&#x27;s Health Care System in 1993. Today, St. Mary&#x27;s is part of Trinity Health, one of the nation&#x27;s largest non-profit Catholic healthcare systems that includes 93 hospitals in 26 states and includes St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Athens, nearby 56-bed St. Mary&#x27;s Sacred Heart Hospital in Lavonia, Ga., and 25-bed St. Mary&#x27;s Good Samaritan Hospital in Greensboro, Ga.

<text>Comparative religion is the branch of the study of religions with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices, themes and impacts (including migration) of the world&#x27;s religions. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as ethics, metaphysics and the nature and forms of salvation. It also considers and compares the origins and similarities shared between the various religions of the world. Studying such material facilitates a broadened and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the sacred, numinous, spiritual and divine.

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification of the main world religions distinguishes groups such as Middle Eastern religions (including Abrahamic religions and Iranian religions), Indian religions, East Asian religions, African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.

There also exist various sociological classifications of religious movements.

== History ==

Al-Biruni (973 – ) and Ibn Hazm (994 – 1064), both of the Islamic Golden Age and considered the &quot;fathers of comparative religion&quot;, compared the study of religious pluralism and their works have been significant in the fields of theology and philosophy. The Persian Al-Biruni discussed his idea of history in &quot;The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries&quot; ( AD) which was translated by Eduard Sachau in the 19th century. It is a comparative study of calendars of different cultures and civilizations, interlaced with mathematical, astronomical, and historical information, exploring the customs and religions of different peoples.

In the seventeenth century, antiquarians such as Athanasius Kircher along with Sir Thomas Browne were pioneering scholars of comparative religion.

Social scientists in the 19th century took a strong interest in comparative and &quot;primitive&quot; religion through the work of Max Müller, Edward Burnett Tylor, William Robertson Smith, James George Frazer, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Rudolf Otto.
Nicholas de Lange, Professor of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at Cambridge University, says that

Examples that demonstrate this point are Buddhism and Chinese Folk Religions. These belief systems have not historically been seen as mutually exclusive and have blended over time into different beliefs such as Pure Land Buddhism. This shows a marked difference from Western conceptions of religions, which see adherence to one religion as precluding membership of another faith.

Hinduism and Buddhism provide another insight in the form of soteriology. Comparative study of religions may approach religions with a base idea of salvation with eternal life after death, but religions like Hinduism or Buddhism don&#x27;t necessarily share this view. Instead, Hinduism and Theravada Buddhism both speak of a falling back into nonexistence and escaping the cycle of reincarnation, rather than eternal life after death.

== Geographical classification ==
According to Charles Joseph Adams, in the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification discerns the main world religions as follows:

# Middle Eastern religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and a variety of ancient belief systems;
# East Asian religions, the religious communities of China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam, and consisting of Confucianism, Taoism, the various schools of Mahayana (“Greater Vehicle”) Buddhism, and Shintō; 
# Indian religions, including early Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and sometimes also the Theravada (“Way of the Elders”) Buddhism and the Hindu- and Buddhist-inspired religions of South and Southeast Asia; 
# African religions, the ancient belief systems of the various indigenous peoples of Africa, excluding ancient Egyptian religion, which is considered to belong to the ancient Middle East;
# American religions, the beliefs and practices of the various Indigenous peoples of the two American continents; 
# Oceanic religions, the religious systems of the peoples of the Pacific islands, Australia, and New Zealand; and 
# Religions of ancient Greece and Rome and their Hellenistic descendants.

=== Middle Eastern religions ===
==== Abrahamic or Western Asian religions ====
In the study of comparative religion, the category of Abrahamic religions consists of the three monotheistic religions, Christianity, Islam and Judaism, which claim Abraham (Hebrew &quot;Avraham&quot; אַבְרָהָם; Arabic &quot;Ibrahim&quot; إبراهيم ) as a part of their sacred history. Smaller religions such as Baháʼí Faith that fit this description are sometimes included but are often omitted.

The original belief in the God of Abraham eventually became strictly monotheistic present-day Rabbinic Judaism. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenant that God established with the Children of Israel. Jews hold that the Torah is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or the Hebrew Bible. They also believe in a supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud.

Christians believe that Christianity is the fulfillment and continuation of the Jewish Old Testament. Christians believe that Jesus (Hebrew &quot;Yeshua&quot; יֵשׁוּעַ) is the awaited Messiah (Christ) foretold in the Old Testament prophecies, and believe in subsequent New Testament scripture. Generally, Christians believe that Jesus is both the incarnation of God and the Son of God. Their creeds generally hold in common that the incarnation, ministry, suffering, death on the cross, and resurrection of Jesus was for the salvation of mankind.

Islam believes the present Christian and Jewish scriptures have been corrupted over time and are no longer the original divine revelations as given to the Jewish people and to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. For Muslims, the Quran is the final, complete revelation from God (Arabic الله &quot;Allah&quot;), who believe it to have been revealed to Muhammad alone, who is believed by Muslims to be the final prophet of Islam, and the &quot;Khatam an-Nabiyyin&quot;, meaning the last of the prophets ever sent by Allah (&quot;seal of the prophets&quot;).

Based on the Muslim figure of the Mahdī, the ultimate savior of humankind and the final Imām of the Twelve Imams, Ali Muhammad Shirazi, later known as Bab, created the Bábí movement out of the belief that he was the gate to the Twelfth Imām. This signaled a break with Islam and started a new religious system, Bábism. However, in the 1860s a split occurred after which the vast majority of Bábís who considered Mirza Husayn `Ali or Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh to be Báb&#x27;s spiritual successor founded the Baháʼí Movement, while the minority who followed Subh-i-Azal came to be called Azalis. The Baháʼí division eventually became a full-fledged religion of its own, the Baháʼí Faith. In comparison to the other Abrahamic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam - the number of adherents for Baháʼí faith and other minor Abrahamic religions are not very significant.

Out of the three major Abrahamic faiths, Christianity and Judaism are the two religions that diverge the most in theology and practice.

The historical interaction between Islam and Judaism started in the 7th century CE with the origin and spread of Islam. There are many common aspects between Islam and Judaism, and as Islam developed, it gradually became the major religion closest to Judaism. In contrast to Christianity, which originated from interaction between ancient Greek, Roman, and Hebrew cultures, Judaism is very similar to Islam in its fundamental religious outlook, structure, jurisprudence and practice. There are many traditions within Islam that originate from traditions which are recorded in the Hebrew Bible or stem from post-biblical Jewish traditions. These practices are known collectively as the &quot;Isra&#x27;iliyat&quot;.

The historical interaction between Christianity and Islam connects fundamental ideas in Christianity with similar ones in Islam. Islam accepts many aspects of Christianity as part of its faithwith some differences in interpretationand rejects other aspects. Islam holds the Quran is the final revelation from God and a completion of all previous revelations, including the Bible.

Mandaeism, sometimes also known as Sabianism (after the mysterious Sabians mentioned in the Quran, a name historically claimed by several religious groups), is a Gnostic and monotheistic religion. John the Baptist is their chief prophet and frequent baptism is part of their core beliefs. According to most scholars, Mandaeism originated sometime in the first three centuries CE, in either southwestern Mesopotamia or the Syro-Palestinian area. However, some scholars take the view that Mandaeism is older and dates from pre-Christian times. Mandaeans assert that their religion predates Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as a monotheistic faith. Mandaeans believe that they descend directly from Shem, Noah&#x27;s son, and also from John the Baptist&#x27;s original disciples.

==== Iranian religions ====
Several important religions and religious movements originated in Greater Iran, that is, among speakers of various Iranian languages. They include Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, Ætsæg Din, Yazdanism, Ahl-e Haqq, Zurvanism, Manichaeism, and Mazdakism.

Perhaps one of the most important religions that originated in Iran was Zoroastrianism. While not, properly speaking, a world religion, it became widespread in the Iranian cultural sphere, especially through the Achaemenid and Sasanian Empires. It went into decline alongside many Iranian religions with the rise of Islam and the establishment of Caliphates. The religion still survives today in small numbers, with a particularly notable example being the Parsis in India and Pakistan.

Scholars have often noted the similarities between Zoroastrianism and the Abrahamic religions, especially Christianity. They&#x27;ve particularly noted this due to the historic relationship between the Jews and the Zoroastrian Persian Empires, as well as the relationship between Greek philosophy, Persia, and Christianity. They&#x27;ve debated whether Zoroastrianism played an influential role in shaping these religions. 

Key areas of concern include a shared sense of duality between the forces of good and evil, or light and darkness. In addition to this, there is a shared belief in the resurrection of the dead as well as an emphasis on free will and the moral responsibility of mankind. These are seen by some as having influenced the three major Abrahamic faiths as well as Gnosticism and the Baháʼí Faith.

Manichaeism is another Iranian faith that shares many similarities with Zoroastrianism. Notably, Manichaeism shares a belief in the prophethood of Zoroaster while also acknowledging the prophethood of Gautama Buddha and Jesus Christ. It shares a dualist cosmology that pits good and light against evil and darkness, with an adversary to oppose the benevolent God. Furthermore, Manichaeism and Mandaeism also share a common belief in many of the figures and stories of the Abrahamic faiths, which has raised questions of influences and origins.

=== Indian religions ===

In comparative religion, Indian religions refer to all the faiths that originated in South Asia. It is believed that &quot;the kinship of the religions of India stems from the fact that Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs look back to Hinduism as their common mother.&quot;

Al-Biruni deeply studied the Vedic religions, and through his works essential details about pre-11th century Indian religions and cultures emerged. Adi Shankaracharya was an early 8th century philosopher and theologian who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta. Gautama Buddha is mentioned as an Avatar of Vishnu in the Puranic texts of Hinduism. Most Hindus believe the Buddha accepted and incorporated many tenets of Hinduism in his doctrine. Prominent modern Hindu reformers such as Mahatma Gandhi and Vivekananda acknowledge Buddhist influence. Like Hindus, Gandhi himself did not believe Buddha established a non-Hindu tradition. He writes, &quot;I do not regard Jainism or Buddhism as separate from Hinduism.&quot;

=== East Asian or Taoic religions ===

A Taoic religion is a religious philosophy that centers on the East Asian concept of &quot;Tao, meaning&quot; &quot;The Way&quot;. This forms a large group of eastern religions, including Taoism, Confucianism, Jeung San Do, Shintoism, I-Kuan Tao, Chondogyo, and Chen Tao. In large parts of East Asia, Buddhism has taken on some taoic features.

Tao can be roughly defined as the flow of the universe or the force behind the natural order. It is believed to influence the balance and order of the cosmos and is closely associated with nature, as it is thought that nature exemplifies the Tao. 

The flow of &quot;qi&quot;, as the essential energy of action and existence, is often compared to the universal order represented by the &quot;Tao&quot;. Following the &quot;Tao&quot; is also associated with a &quot;proper&quot; attitude, morality and lifestyle. This concept is intimately tied to the complex idea of &quot;De&quot;, or literally &quot;virtue&quot; or &quot;power.&quot; &quot;De&quot; is the active expression of &quot;Tao&quot;.

Taoism and Chan Buddhism for centuries had a mutual influence on each other in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. These influences were inherited by Zen Buddhism when Chan Buddhism arrived in Japan and adapted as Zen Buddhism.

Despite the geographical distance that would seemingly preclude any direct influence, some scholars have historically observed similarities between traditional Chinese religious beliefs and Christianity. This was noted by Jesuit missionaries who became known as figurists. Figurists promoted the idea that the ancient Chinese knew the truth of Christian revelation and that many of the figures described in Chinese texts are actually figures and concepts from Christianity. Noted parallels include shared flood myths, similarities between Fuxi and Enoch, as well as parallels between Christ and the sages. There is also a noted similarity between the Tao being &quot;the Way&quot; as well as Christ claiming to be &quot;the Way.&quot;

While scholarship rejects this view today, it was a notable view in the history of comparative religion. These beliefs were ultimately opposed and disavowed by the Catholic Church in the 18th century.

The introduction of Nestorian Christianity to China under the Tang dynasty also led to increasing similarities between Chinese Buddhism and Nestorian Christianity. Christians began using Buddhist and Taoist concepts to explain their faith. During this time the Jingjiao documents were created, sometimes called sutras that demonstrated the blending of Christianity with Buddhism. Nestorian Christians and Buddhists formed a monastic tradition that furthered the similarities. This fusion was so pronounced that when Emperor Wuzong of the Tang dynasty began persecuting Buddhists in the 9th century, he claimed Christianity was merely a heresy of Buddhism rather than a distinct religion. This conflation contributed to the collapse of Nestorian Christianity in China during the Buddhist persecutions.

== Comparing traditions ==
Religious ideologies can be systematically understood as having formed many major groups with tens of thousands of subbranches. It is a form of cultural evolution that can be intuitively illustrated through trees depicting historical relationships and the diversification over time of the various traditions. Some of the most successful have been those religions that aligned with empires, kingdoms, or caliphates early in their history (e.g., Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism). A few major groups of religion are given below.

<text>Holy Island (, &#x27;the island of (Saint) Cybi&#x27;) is an island on the western side of the larger Isle of Anglesey, Wales, from which it is separated by the Cymyran Strait. It is called &quot;Holy&quot; because of the high concentration of standing stones, burial chambers and other religious sites on the small island. The alternative English name of the island is Holyhead Island. According to the 2011 UK Census, the population was 13,659, of whom 11,431 (84%) lived in the largest town, Holyhead.

==Pre-history of Holy Island==
The settlement of Holy Island, Anglesey is dated to with the discovery of an original Neolithic long house. The long house is similar to those found in Scotland and elsewhere in the British Isles. Also near the Neolithic site on the middle of Holy island is the Bronze Age Ty Mawr standing stone (Menhir), which is a Monolith measuring 2.67m high (8 feet).
Permanent settlement on Anglesey was established in different forms for thousands of years from after the Bronze Age. Many of these sites were used from Neolithic times. This was proven by pottery discoveries. There are ancient hillforts that were in use for nearly a millennium until the Roman invasion of Wales.

A well-preserved hut settlement on Anglesey was adjacent to the Holyhead Mountain hillfort. The Holyhead Mountain Hut Circles (, Big house / &quot;Irishmen&#x27;s Huts&quot;) on Holy Island were inhabited before the Iron Ages, as of . A stone wall built in the enclosure was found with limpet shells dating to 200 BC. Also at the huts was Roman-era ancient pottery proving the hut group habitation from the 3rd to 4th centuries AD. The &quot;Ty Mawr Hut Circles&quot; archaeological excavations were carried out by William Owen Stanley (son of Baron Stanley of Alderley) of Penrhos, in 1862.

Irish settlers invaded Anglesey following the end of Roman rule in Britannia. Cunedda first began warfare against the Irish but ultimately Cadwallon Lawhir defeated the Irish on Holy Island.

==Natural features==
There are a variety of natural habitats on the island including mudflats, dunes, marshes and beaches. Practically nothing is left of the oak forest that covered almost all of the island before the arrival of Neolithic farmers. The western side of the island is taken up mainly by Holyhead Mountain, an area of maritime heather moor, which is the highest peak in the county at . North Stack and South Stack are two islands just off the coast by Holyhead Mountain. South Stack is joined to Holy Island by steep steps and a suspension bridge which provides access to the South Stack Lighthouse.

Whilst most of the coastline is rocky, there are sandy beaches at Trearddur Bay and Penrhos Country Park. Due to its rocky nature the island has seen many shipwrecks through the years. The coastal zone between the island and the mainland of Anglesey is a large site of special scientific interest: Beddmanarch–Cymyran.

==Transport==

Holy Island is connected to Anglesey by two road links. The first, the Stanley Embankment, is made up of causeways carrying the A5 and A55. The second is the much older original link, Four Mile Bridge. The Stanley Embankment also carries the North Wales Coast Line which terminates at the island&#x27;s only railway station, in Holyhead. The Port of Holyhead has passenger and freight ferries which travel to Dublin Port, Ireland. Buses from the island run to Amlwch, Llangefni and Bangor, amongst other places.

Around of the Anglesey Coastal Path is on Holy Island. National Cycle Route 5 and National Cycle Route 8 traverse the island. The nearest airport is Anglesey Airport a few miles away on the Anglesey mainland and provides daily flights to Cardiff. The nearest major airport is Liverpool John Lennon Airport, away.

==Sport and tourism==

There are three association football teams in the Welsh football league system on the island: Holyhead Hotspur, Caergybi and Trearddur Bay. The New Oval ground is home to the Ynys Môn football team and hosted the finals of the 2019 Inter Games Football Tournament. There is also a rugby union side and a golf course. Holyhead Park contains lawn bowling greens, three public tennis courts and a skate park. Like the rest of Anglesey, owing to its exposed location in the Irish Sea, surfing is popular.

Many people staying on Holy Island do so short term whilst waiting for the ferries to Dublin Port. As such the largest hotels (Travelodge and Premier Inn) are located close to the A5/A55 roads. Centred in Holyhead but dotted around the island (especially Trearddur Bay and Rhoscolyn) are quite a number of smaller bed and breakfast hotels and caravan parks for people who may wish to stay longer. Attractions in the area include South Stack Lighthouse and the RSPB reserve close by, the Breakwater Country Park, the RNLI museum and walks up Holyhead Mountain.

==Schools and governance==

There are six primary schools and one secondary school, Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi, which lays claim to being the first Comprehensive school in England and Wales. Tertiary education can be found at Bangor University, some away on the Welsh mainland.

Along with the rest of Anglesey, Holy Island is part of the Ynys Môn UK Parliament constituency and the Ynys Môn Senedd constituency. At a local level it is run by Isle of Anglesey County Council. Holy Island returns six of the 30 councillors to the county council, three for Caergybi (Holyhead town centre and surrounds) and three for Ynys Gybi (the southern extremes of Holyhead town and the more rural south). Holyhead Town Council is made up of seven electoral wards who return 16 councillors and appoint a mayor and deputy mayor annually.

<text>In modular arithmetic, a number is a primitive root modulo if every number coprime to is congruent to a power of modulo . That is, is a &quot;primitive root modulo&quot;  if for every integer coprime to , there is some integer for which ≡ (mod ). Such a value is called the index or [[discrete logarithm]] of to the base modulo . So is a &quot;primitive root modulo&quot;  if and only if is a generator of the multiplicative group of integers modulo.

Gauss defined primitive roots in Article 57 of the &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; (1801), where he credited Euler with coining the term. In Article 56 he stated that Lambert and Euler knew of them, but he was the first to rigorously demonstrate that primitive roots exist for a prime . In fact, the &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; contains two proofs: The one in Article 54 is a nonconstructive existence proof, while the proof in Article 55 is constructive.

A primitive root exists if and only if &quot;n&quot; is 1, 2, 4, &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; or 2&quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime and . For all other values of &quot;n&quot; the multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot; is not cyclic.
This was first proved by Gauss.

==Elementary example==
The number 3 is a primitive root modulo 7 because
formula_1

Here we see that the period of 3 modulo 7 is 6. The remainders in the period, which are 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, form a rearrangement of all nonzero remainders modulo 7, implying that 3 is indeed a primitive root modulo 7. This derives from the fact that a sequence ( modulo ) always repeats after some value of , since modulo  produces a finite number of values. If is a primitive root modulo  and is prime, then the period of repetition is Permutations created in this way (and their circular shifts) have been shown to be Costas arrays.

==Definition==
If is a positive integer, the integers from 1 to that are coprime to (or equivalently, the congruence classes coprime to ) form a group, with multiplication modulo as the operation; it is denoted by formula_2, and is called the group of units modulo , or the group of primitive classes modulo . As explained in the article multiplicative group of integers modulo, this multiplicative group (formula_2) is cyclic if and only if is equal to 2, 4, , or 2 where is a power of an odd prime number. When (and only when) this group formula_2 is cyclic, a generator of this cyclic group is called a primitive root modulo (or in fuller language primitive root of unity modulo , emphasizing its role as a fundamental solution of the roots of unity polynomial equations X − 1 in the ring formula_2), or simply a primitive element of formula_2.

When formula_2 is non-cyclic, such primitive elements mod do not exist. Instead, each prime component of has its own sub-primitive roots (see in the examples below).

For any (whether or not formula_2 is cyclic), the order of formula_2 is given by Euler&#x27;s totient function () . And then, Euler&#x27;s theorem says that for every coprime to ; the lowest power of that is congruent to 1 modulo is called the multiplicative order of modulo . In particular, for to be a primitive root modulo , has to be the smallest power of that is congruent to 1 modulo .

==Examples==

For example, if then the elements of formula_2 are the congruence classes {1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13}; there are of them. Here is a table of their powers modulo 14:

 x x, x2, x3, ... (mod 14)
 1 : 1
 3 : 3, 9, 13, 11, 5, 1 
 5 : 5, 11, 13, 9, 3, 1
 9 : 9, 11, 1
 11 : 11, 9, 1
 13 : 13, 1

The order of 1 is 1, the orders of 3 and 5 are 6, the orders of 9 and 11 are 3, and the order of 13 is 2. Thus, 3 and 5 are the primitive roots modulo 14.

For a second example let The elements of formula_2 are the congruence classes {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14}; there are of them.

 x x, x2, x3, ... (mod 15)
 1 : 1
 2 : 2, 4, 8, 1 
 4 : 4, 1
 7 : 7, 4, 13, 1
 8 : 8, 4, 2, 1
 11 : 11, 1
 13 : 13, 4, 7, 1
 14 : 14, 1

Since there is no number whose order is 8, there are no primitive roots modulo 15. Indeed, , where is the Carmichael function. 

==Table of primitive roots==

Numbers formula_12 that have a primitive root are of the shape
:formula_13
:= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, ...}.
These are the numbers formula_12 with formula_15 kept also in the sequence in the OEIS.

The following table lists the primitive roots modulo up to formula_16:
==Properties==

Gauss proved that for any prime number (with the sole exception of the product of its primitive roots is congruent to 1 modulo .

He also proved that for any prime number , the sum of its primitive roots is congruent to ( − 1) modulo , where is the Möbius function.

For example,

E.g., the product of the latter primitive roots is formula_17, and their sum is formula_18.

If formula_19 is a primitive root modulo the prime formula_20, then formula_21.

Artin&#x27;s conjecture on primitive roots states that a given integer that is neither a perfect square nor −1 is a primitive root modulo infinitely many primes.

==Finding primitive roots==

No simple general formula to compute primitive roots modulo is known. There are however methods to locate a primitive root that are faster than simply trying out all candidates. If the multiplicative order (its exponent) of a number modulo is equal to formula_22 (the order of formula_2), then it is a primitive root. In fact the converse is true: If is a primitive root modulo , then the multiplicative order of is formula_24 We can use this to test a candidate to see if it is primitive.

For formula_25 first, compute formula_26 Then determine the different prime factors of formula_22, say 1, ..., . Finally, compute
:formula_28
using a fast algorithm for modular exponentiation such as exponentiation by squaring. A number for which these results are all different from 1 is a primitive root.

The number of primitive roots modulo , if there are any, is equal to
:formula_29
since, in general, a cyclic group with elements has formula_30 generators.

For prime , this equals formula_31, and since formula_32 the generators are very common among {2, ..., −1} and thus it is relatively easy to find one.

If is a primitive root modulo , then is also a primitive root modulo all powers unless −1 ≡ 1 (mod 2); in that case, + is.

If is a primitive root modulo , then is also a primitive root modulo all smaller powers of .

If is a primitive root modulo , then either or + (whichever one is odd) is a primitive root modulo 2.

Finding primitive roots modulo is also equivalent to finding the roots of the ( − 1)st cyclotomic polynomial modulo .

==Order of magnitude of primitive roots==

The least primitive root modulo (in the range 1, 2, ..., is generally small.

===Upper bounds===
Burgess (1962) proved that for every &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0 there is a such that formula_33

Grosswald (1981) proved that if formula_34, then formula_35

Shoup (1990, 1992) proved, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, that 

===Lower bounds===
Fridlander (1949) and Salié (1950) proved that there is a positive constant such that for infinitely many primes 

It can be proved in an elementary manner that for any positive integer there are infinitely many primes such that &lt; &lt; 

== Applications ==

A primitive root modulo is often used in pseudorandom number generators and cryptography, including the Diffie–Hellman key exchange scheme. Sound diffusers have been based on number-theoretic concepts such as primitive roots and quadratic residues.

<text>Ida (; died ) is the first known king of the Anglian kingdom of Bernicia, which he ruled from around 547 until his death in 559. Little is known of his life or reign, but he was regarded as the founder of a line from which later Angle kings in this part of central Great Britain claimed descent. His descendants overcame Brittonic resistance and ultimately founded the powerful kingdom of Northumbria.

== Sources ==

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; indicates that Ida&#x27;s reign began in 547, and records him as the son of Eoppa, grandson of Esa, and great-grandson of Ingwy. Likewise, the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; calls him as the son of Eoppa and the first king of &quot;Berneich&quot; or Bernicia. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; elaborates that he ruled for twelve years and built the Bernician capital of Bamburgh Castle. Later, however, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; confuses his territory with the later Northumbria, saying that Ælla, historically a king of Deira rather than Bernicia, succeeded him as king after his death. Northumbria did not exist until the union of Bernicia with the kingdom of Deira; this happened for the first time under Ida&#x27;s grandson Æthelfrith. The genealogies of the Anglo-Saxon kings attached to some manuscripts of the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; give more information on Ida and his family; the text names Ida&#x27;s &quot;one queen&quot; as Bearnoch and indicates that he had twelve sons, naming among them Adda, Æthelric, Theodric, Eadric, Theodhere, Osmere and Ealric. Several of these are listed as kings. One of them, Theodric, is noted for fighting against a Brittonic coalition led by Urien Rheged and his sons. The genealogical preface to &quot;Chronicon ex chronicis&quot; names six sons, Adda, Bealric, Theodric, Ethelric, Osmere, and Theodhere, born to his wife and six born to concubines, Ocga, Alric, Ecca, Oswald, Sogor and Sogothere. Ida&#x27;s successor, Glappa, does not appear among his sons in any of the early sources. Ida&#x27;s descendants would rule Bernicia and later Northumbria.

Some 18th- and 19th-century commentators, beginning with Lewis Morris, associated Ida with the figure of Welsh tradition known as Fflamddwyn (&quot;Flame-bearer&quot;). This Fflamddwyn was evidently an Anglo-Saxon leader opposed by Urien Rheged and his children, particularly his son Owain, who slew him. However, Rachel Bromwich notes that such an identification has little to back it; other writers, such as Thomas Stephens and William Forbes Skene, identify Fflamddwyn instead with Ida&#x27;s son Theodric, noting the passages in the genealogies discussing Theodric&#x27;s battles with Urien and his sons.

At the time Ida ruled, Bernician control did not extend far inland from the coast. It was not until the time of Æthelfrith, Ida&#x27;s grandson, that the kingdom expanded significantly to the west. This is supported by the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;&#x27;s description of fighting between Bernicians and the native Britons of the area, indicating ongoing resistance. It is also supported by the scarcity of sixth-century Anglo-Saxon archaeological finds from further inland.

<doc id="186874" wikidata="Q334006" url="?curid=186874" title="Gwyneth Dunwoody">
<text>Gwyneth Patricia Dunwoody (née Phillips; 12 December 1930 – 17 April 2008) was a British Labour Party politician, who was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Exeter from 1966 to 1970, and then for Crewe (later Crewe and Nantwich) from February 1974 to her death in 2008. She was a moderate socialist and had a reputation as a fiercely independent parliamentarian, described as &quot;intelligent, obstinate, opinionated and hard-working&quot;.

==Early and private life==
Dunwoody was born in Fulham, London, where her father was Labour parliamentary agent. She belonged to an experienced political dynasty: her father, Welsh-born Morgan Phillips, was a former coalminer who served as General Secretary of the Labour Party between 1944 and 1962; her mother, Norah Phillips was a former member of London County Council who became a life peer in 1964 (allowing Dunwoody to be styled &quot;The Honourable&quot;), serving as a government whip in the House of Lords, and as Lord Lieutenant of Greater London from 1978 to 1986. Both of her grandmothers were suffragettes, and all four grandparents were Labour party loyalists.

She attended the Fulham County Secondary School for Girls, now the Fulham Cross Girls&#x27; School, and the Notre Dame Convent (a girls&#x27; grammar school) in Battersea. She left school aged 16, and became a journalist with a local newspaper in Fulham, covering births, marriages and deaths. She joined the Labour Party in 1947, and spoke at the 1948 Labour party conference in Scarborough. She worked as an actress in repertory and as a journalist in the Netherlands, learning fluent Dutch, before suffering a bout of tuberculosis.

=== Married life ===
She married John Dunwoody in 1954, the same year he qualified as a doctor. Her husband became a general practitioner based in Totnes in Devon. They had two sons and a daughter. Their daughter, Tamsin Dunwoody, was a member of the National Assembly for Wales for one term between 2003 and 2007 and from 2005 was Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Innovation and Networks in the Welsh Assembly Government.

Her husband stood as Labour candidate in the safe Conservative seat of Tiverton in 1959, and came close to winning Plymouth Sutton in 1964, losing by just 410 votes (David Owen would later hold for several years for Labour).

Meanwhile, Dunwoody was a councillor on Totnes Borough Council (now South Hams) from 1963 to 1966. Her husband was finally elected as Labour MP for Falmouth and Camborne in 1966 (she was elected at the same time in Exeter). He served as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department of Health and Social Security from 1969 until 1970. A well-regarded orator at the Labour Party Conference, John Dunwoody was spoken of as a future leader of the Party but lost his seat in the 1970 general election and did not return to Parliament. They were divorced in 1975.

== Parliamentary career ==
Dunwoody stood as the Labour Party candidate for the Exeter seat in the 1964 general election. She was elected as Member of Parliament for Exeter in 1966, emulating her husband in Falmouth and Camborne. Like her husband, she also served as a junior minister, as a Parliamentary secretary at the Board of Trade, and also lost her seat at the 1970 general election.

In 1969 whilst serving as Parliamentary secretary to the board of trade she presented rock band Led Zeppelin with gold discs in recognition of the group exporting £5 million of records to the USA (£111,000,000 in 2024)

From 1970 to 1975, she was Director of the Film Producers Association of Great Britain and Consultant to the Association of Independent Cinemas.

She returned to the House of Commons after the February 1974 general election, becoming MP for the safe Labour seat of Crewe, having received the sponsorship of the National Union of Railwaymen (later part of RMT). Dunwoody was also a Member of the European Parliament between 1975 and 1979 (alongside John Prescott) at a time when MEPs were nominated by national parliaments — MEPs have been directly elected since 1979.

In 1983, Dunwoody stood for election as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, alongside Peter Shore, on a Eurosceptic platform (a position she consistently maintained throughout her career - she voted against the Maastricht Treaty seven times). The position was won by Roy Hattersley, and Dunwoody came last out of the four candidates with 1.3% of the Electoral College.

She did not return to ministerial office, but served as a front bench spokesman on, by turns, transport, health, and foreign affairs during the 18 years of Labour opposition from 1979 to 1997. She also served on the Labour National Executive Committee for seven years, from 1981 to 1988, collaborating closely with Betty Boothroyd. She resisted the Militant group in her constituency and later opposed all-women shortlists.

In 1983, boundary changes abolished the constituency of Crewe and created the constituency of Crewe and Nantwich, with many Conservative voters from Nantwich included in the new seat. She narrowly won the election in 1983 by 290 votes. She remained MP at Crewe and Nantwich until her death in 2008, having benefited from a further redrawing of the boundaries in 1997 which increased her majority substantially.

In 1998, she gained headlines around the world when she clashed with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urging the return of the original Winnie the Pooh dolls from Donnell Library Center to the British Museum after she said she &quot;detected sadness&quot; in their display behind bulletproof glass in the United States library.

In October 2000, she was one of several candidates for the speakership of the House of Commons. The election was won by Michael Martin MP.

As a member for a constituency with a strong connection with the railway industry, she had considerable expertise on transport matters, and was Chair of the House of Commons&#x27; Transport Committee from 1997 to 2008. In this role she was a credible, independent-minded critic of the government, and she and her committee discomfited witnesses from the rail and air transport industries.

An attempt by the government whips to remove her and Donald Anderson, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, from their positions after the 2001 general election led to a revolt by back-bench members of Parliament, which resulted in them both being reinstated.

She was President of Labour Friends of Israel from 1988 to 1993, and was a parliamentary consultant to the British Fur Federation. She was one of 13 Labour MPs to vote against a reduction of the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16.

She had a house in her constituency, and a flat in the Barbican. She suffered from financial problems in the late 1980s, with a house in her constituency being repossessed due to mortgage arrears, was threatened with eviction from her London flat, and had furniture seized by bailiffs to meet rent arrears. She was sued by Barclays Bank due to an unpaid loan.

The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; described her as &quot;Clever, acerbic, fiercely independent and often just plain funny&quot;, noting her willingness to cast party allegiance aside.

==Death==
Dunwoody died during the evening of 17 April 2008 in John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, following emergency heart surgery. Her funeral was held at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster on 8 May 2008. She is buried at North Sheen Cemetery.

Her former husband died in 2006. She was survived by her daughter and two sons.

Her daughter Tamsin Dunwoody was selected as the Labour Party candidate in the by-election for Crewe and Nantwich. The by-election was announced by chief party whip Geoff Hoon on Wednesday 30 April 2008 and was held on Thursday 22 May 2008. Dunwoody lost the by-election and the Conservative candidate, Edward Timpson, became her mother&#x27;s successor.

==Records==

In late September 2007, Dunwoody beat Irene Ward&#x27;s record of the longest total service for a woman MP, at 37 years, 9 months. In early December 2007, she beat Barbara Castle&#x27;s record of the longest unbroken service for a woman MP, at 33 years, 9 months. These records have since been broken by Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman respectively.

==Legacy==
In January 2007, railway operator GB Railfreight named locomotive 66719 &quot;Gwyneth Dunwoody&quot;. Dunwoody Way in Crewe is named after Gwyneth Dunwoody.

<doc id="186876" wikidata="Q3182018" url="?curid=186876" title="Smithfield, London">
<text>Smithfield, properly known as West Smithfield, is a district located in Central London, part of Farringdon Without, the most westerly ward of the City of London, England. 

Smithfield is home to a number of City institutions, such as St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital and livery halls, including those of the Butchers&#x27; and Haberdashers&#x27; Companies. The area is best known for the Smithfield meat market, which dates from the 10th century, has been in continuous operation since medieval times, and is now London&#x27;s only remaining wholesale market. Each summer, from the 12th century to the 19th century the area hosted Bartholomew Fair. Smithfield&#x27;s principal street is called &quot;West Smithfield&quot;, and the area also contains the City&#x27;s oldest surviving church building, St Bartholomew-the-Great, dating from 1123 (most City churches were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666).

Being just beyond the New Gate and its prison which held the condemned, the area has borne witness to many executions of heretics and political rebels over the centuries, as well as Scottish knight Sir William Wallace, and Wat Tyler, leader of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt, among many other religious reformers and dissenters (later on, public executions were generally moved out to Tyburn, until being moved back to the prison).

The present Smithfield Market, a Grade II listed-covered market building, was designed by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones in the second half of the 19th century, and is the dominant architectural feature of the area. Some of its original market premises fell into disuse in the late 20th century and faced the prospect of demolition. The Corporation of London&#x27;s public enquiry in 2012 drew widespread support for an urban regeneration plan intent upon preserving Smithfield&#x27;s historical identity.

==Smithfield area==

In the Middle Ages, it was a broad grassy area known as &quot;Smooth Field&quot;, located beyond London Wall stretching to the eastern bank of the River Fleet. Given its ease of access to grazing and water, Smithfield established itself as London&#x27;s livestock market, remaining so for almost 1,000 years. Many local toponyms are associated with the livestock trade: while some street names (such as &quot;Cow Cross Street&quot; and &quot;Cock Lane&quot;) remain in use, many more (such as &quot;Chick Lane&quot;, &quot;Duck Lane&quot;, &quot;Cow Lane&quot;, &quot;Pheasant Court&quot;, &quot;Goose Alley&quot;) have disappeared from the map after the major redevelopment of the area in the Victorian era.

===Religious history===

In 1123, the area near Aldersgate was granted by King Henry I for the foundation of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Priory at the request of Prior Rahere, in thanks for his being nursed back to good health. The Priory exercised its right to enclose land between the vicinity of the boundary with Aldersgate Without (to the east), Long Lane (to the north) and modern-day Newgate Street (to the south), erecting its main western gate which opened onto Smithfield, and a postern on Long Lane. By facing the open space of Smithfield and by having &#x27;its back to&#x27; the buildings lining Aldersgate Street, the Priory site has left a continuing legacy of limited connectivity between the Smithfield area and Aldersgate Street.

The Priory thereafter held the manorial rights to hold weekly fairs, which initially took place in its outer court on the site of present-day Cloth Fair, leading to &quot;Fair Gate&quot;.

An additional annual celebration, the Bartholomew Fair, was established in 1133 by the Augustinian canons. Over time, this became one of London&#x27;s pre-eminent summer fairs, opening each year on 24 August. A trading event for cloth and other goods as well as being a pleasure forum, the four-day festival drew crowds from all strata of English society.

In 1855, however, the City authorities closed Bartholomew Fair as they considered it to have degenerated into a magnet for debauchery and public disorder.

In 1348, Walter de Manny rented of land at &quot;Spital Croft&quot;, north of Long Lane, from the Master and Brethren of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, for a graveyard and plague pit for victims of the Black Death. A chapel and hermitage were constructed, renamed &quot;New Church Haw&quot;; but in 1371, this land was granted for the foundation of the Charterhouse, originally a Carthusian monastery.

Nearby and to the north of this demesne, the Knights Hospitaller established a Commandery at Clerkenwell, dedicated to St John in the mid-12th century. In 1194 they received a Charter from King Richard I granting the Order formal privileges. Later Augustinian canonesses established the Priory of St Mary, north of the Knights of St John property.

By the end of the 14th century, these religious houses were regarded by City traders as interlopers – occupying what had previously been public open space near one of the City gates. On numerous occasions vandals damaged the Charterhouse, eventually demolishing its buildings. By 1405, a stout wall was built to protect the property and maintain the privacy of the Order, particularly its church where men and women alike came to worship.

The religious houses were dissolved in the Reformation, and their lands broken up. The Priory Church of St John remains, as does St John&#x27;s Gate. John Houghton (later canonized by Pope Paul VI as &quot;St John Houghton&quot;), The prior of Charterhouse went to Thomas Cromwell, accompanied by two other local priors, seeking an oath of supremacy that would be acceptable to their communities. Instead they were imprisoned in the Tower of London, and on 4 May 1535, they were taken to Tyburn and hanged – becoming the first Catholic martyrs of the Reformation. On 29 May, the remaining twenty monks and eighteen lay brothers were forced to swear the oath of allegiance to King Henry VIII; the ten who refused were taken to Newgate Prison and left to starve.

With the monks expelled, Charterhouse was requisitioned and remained as a private dwelling until its reestablishment by Thomas Sutton in 1611 as a charitable foundation; it was the basis of the school named Charterhouse and almshouses known as &quot;Sutton&#x27;s Hospital in Charterhouse&quot; on its former site. The school was relocated to Godalming in 1872. Until 1899 Charterhouse was extra-parochial; that year it became a civil parish incorporated in the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. Some of the property was damaged during The Blitz, but it remains largely intact. Part of the site is now occupied by Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.

From its inception, the Priory of St Bartholomew treated the sick. After the Reformation it was left with neither income nor monastic occupants but, following a petition by the City Corporation, Henry VIII refounded it in December 1546, as the &quot;House of the Poore in West Smithfield in the suburbs of the City of London of Henry VIII&#x27;s Foundation&quot;. Letters Patent were presented to the City, granting property and income to the new foundation the following month. King Henry VIII&#x27;s sergeant-surgeon, Thomas Vicary, was appointed as the hospital&#x27;s first . The King Henry VIII Gate, which opens onto West Smithfield, was completed in 1702 and remains the hospital&#x27;s main entrance.

The Priory&#x27;s principal church, St Bartholomew-the-Great, was reconfigured after the dissolution of the monasteries, losing the western third of its nave. Reformed as an Anglican parish church, its parish boundaries were limited to the site of the ancient priory and a small tract of land between the church and Long Lane. The parish of St Bartholomew the Great was designated as a Liberty, responsible for the upkeep and security of its fabric and the land within its boundaries. With the advent of street lighting, mains water, and sewerage during the Victorian era, maintenance of such an ancient parish with so few parishioners became increasingly uneconomical after the Industrial Revolution. In 1910, it agreed to be incorporated by the Corporation of London which guaranteed financial support and security. Great St Barts&#x27; present parish boundary includes just 10 feet (3.048 m) of Smithfield – possibly delineating a former right of way.

After the Reformation, a separate parish likewise dedicated to St Bartholomew was granted in favour of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital; named St Bartholomew-the-Less, it remained under the hospital&#x27;s patronage, unique in the Church of England, until 1948, when the hospital was nationalized in the National Health Service. The church benefice has since been joined again with its ancient partner, the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great.

Following the diminished influence of the ancient Priory, predecessor of the two parishes of St Bartholomew, disputes began to arise over rights to tithes and taxes payable by lay residents who claimed allegiance with the nearby and anciently associated parish of St Botolph Aldersgate – an unintended consequence and legacy of King Henry VIII&#x27;s religious reforms.

Smithfield and its market, situated mostly in the parish of St Sepulchre, was founded in 1137, and was endowed by Prior Rahere, who also founded St Barts. The ancient parish of St Sepulchre extended north to Turnmill Street, to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Ludgate Hill in the south, and along the east bank of the Fleet (now the route of Farringdon Street). St Sepulchre&#x27;s Tower contains the twelve &quot;bells of Old Bailey&quot;, referred to in the nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;. Traditionally, the Great Bell was rung to announce the execution of a prisoner at Newgate.

===Civil history===
As a large open space close to the City, Smithfield was a popular place for public gatherings. In 1374 Edward III held a seven-day tournament at Smithfield, for the amusement of his beloved Alice Perrers. Possibly the most famous medieval tournament at Smithfield was that commanded in 1390 by Richard II. Jean Froissart, in his fourth book of Chronicles, reported that sixty knights would come to London to tilt for two days, &quot;accompanied by sixty noble ladies, richly ornamented and dressed&quot;. The tournament was proclaimed by heralds throughout England, Scotland, Hainault, Germany, Flanders and France, so as to rival the jousts given by Charles of France at Paris a few years earlier, upon the arrival of his consort Isabel of Bavaria. Geoffrey Chaucer supervised preparations for the tournament as a clerk to the King. It is told that, between 1389 and 1394, another large tournament was celebrated in the city which spawned the Portuguese legend of the Twelve of England, where twelve Portuguese knights were called to defend the honour of several ladies-in-waiting of John of Gaunt&#x27;s castillian wife Constance of Castile. At the time, John of Gaunt&#x27;s daughter Philipa of Lancaster was married to John of Aviz, King of Portugal, lending credence to the story, although how much and which parts of it are true is still debated.
Along with Tyburn, Smithfield was for centuries the main site for the public execution of heretics and dissidents in London. The Scottish nobleman Sir William Wallace was executed in 1305 at West Smithfield. The market was the prior to the Peasants&#x27; Revolt and where the Revolt&#x27;s leader, Wat Tyler, was slain by Sir William Walworth, Lord Mayor of London on 15 June 1381.

Religious dissenters (Catholics as well as other Protestant denominations such as Anabaptists) were sentenced to death in this area during the Crown&#x27;s changing course of religious orientation started by King Henry VIII. About fifty Protestants and religious reformers, known as the Marian martyrs, were executed at Smithfield during the reign of Mary I.

G. K. Chesterton observed ironically:
On 17 November 1558, several Protestant heretics were saved by a royal herald&#x27;s timely announcement that Queen Mary had died shortly before the wooden faggots were to be lit at the Smithfield Stake. Under English Law death warrants were commanded by Sign Manual (the personal signature of the Monarch), invariably upon ministerial recommendation, which if unexercised by the time of a Sovereign&#x27;s death required renewed authority. In this case Queen Elizabeth did not approve the executions, thus freeing the Protestants. During the 16th century, the Smithfield site was also the place of execution of swindlers and coin forgers, who were boiled to death in oil.

By the 18th century, the &quot;Tyburn Tree&quot; (near the present-day Marble Arch) became the main place for public executions in London. After 1785, executions were again moved, this time to the gates of Newgate prison, just to the south of Smithfield.

The Smithfield area emerged largely unscathed by the Great Fire of London in 1666, which was abated near the Fortune of War Tavern, at the junction of Giltspur Street and Cock Lane, where the statue of the Golden Boy of Pye Corner is located. In the late 17th century several residents of Smithfield emigrated to North America, where they founded the town of Smithfield, Rhode Island.

===West Smithfield Bars===
Until the 19th century, the area included boundary markers known as the West Smithfield Bars (or more simply, Smithfield Bars). These marked the northern boundary of the City of London and were placed at a point approximating to where modern Charterhouse Street meets St John Street, which was historically the first stretch of the Great North Road. The Bars were on the route of the former Fagswell Brook, a tributary of the Fleet, which marked the City&#x27;s northern boundary in the area.

The Bars are first documented in 1170 and 1197, and were a site of public executions.

===Today===
Since the late 1990s, Smithfield and neighbouring Farringdon have developed a reputation for being a cultural hub for up-and-coming professionals, who enjoy its bars, restaurants and nightclubs.

Nightclubs such as Fabric and Turnmills pioneered the area&#x27;s reputation for trendy night life, attracting professionals from nearby Holborn, Clerkenwell and the City on weekdays. At weekends, the clubs and bars in the area, having late licences, draw people into the area from outside London too.

Smithfield has also become a venue for sporting events. Until 2002 Smithfield hosted the midnight start of the annual Miglia Quadrato car treasure hunt, but with the increased night club activity around Smithfield, the UHULMC (a motoring club) decided to move the event&#x27;s start to Finsbury Circus. Since 2007, Smithfield has been the chosen site of an annual event dedicated to road bicycle racing known as the &quot;Smithfield Nocturne&quot;.

Number 1, West Smithfield is head office of the Churches Conservation Trust.

== Market ==
=== Origins ===
Meat has been traded at Smithfield Market for more than 800 years, making it one of the oldest markets in London. A livestock market occupied the site as early as the 10th century.

In 1174 the site was described by William Fitzstephen as:
a smooth field where every Friday there is a celebrated rendezvous of fine horses to be traded, and in another quarter are placed vendibles of the peasant, swine with their deep flanks, and cows and oxen of immense bulk.
Costs, customs and rules were meticulously laid down. For instance, for an ox, a cow or a dozen sheep one could get 1 penny.
The livestock market expanded over the centuries to meet demand from the growing population of the City. In 1710, the market was surrounded by a wooden fence containing the livestock within the market. Until the market&#x27;s abolition, the Gate House at Cloth Fair (&quot;Fair Gate&quot;) employed a chain (&quot;le cheyne&quot;) on market days. Daniel Defoe referred to the livestock market in 1726 as being &quot;without question, the greatest in the world&quot;, and data available appear to corroborate his statement.

Between 1740 and 1750 the average yearly sales at Smithfield were reported to be around 74,000 cattle and 570,000 sheep. By the middle of the 19th century, in the course of a single year 220,000 head of cattle and 1,500,000 sheep would be &quot;violently forced into an area of five acres, in the very heart of London, through its narrowest and most crowded thoroughfares&quot;. The volume of cattle driven daily to Smithfield started to raise major concerns.

The Great North Road traditionally began at Smithfield Market, with St John Street and Islington High Street forming the initial stages. Road mileages were taken from Hicks Hall, a short distance up St John Street, some 90 metres north of the &quot;West Smithfield Bars&quot;. The site of the hall continued to be used as the starting point for mileages even after it was demolished soon after 1778. The road followed St John Street, and continued north, eventually leading to Edinburgh. Using the former site of the hall as the starting point ended in 1829, with the establishment of the General Post Office at St Martin&#x27;s-le-Grand, which became the new starting point, with the route following Goswell Road before joining Islington High Street and then re-joining the historic route.

===Local campaigning against the cattle market===
In the Victorian period, pamphlets started circulating in favour of the removal of the livestock market and its relocation outside of the City, due to its extremely poor hygienic conditions as well as the brutal treatment of the cattle. The conditions at the market in the first half of the 19th century were often described as a major threat to public health:

Of all the horrid abominations with which London has been cursed, there is not one that can come up to that disgusting place, West Smithfield Market, for cruelty, filth, effluvia, pestilence, impiety, horrid language, danger, disgusting and shuddering sights, and every obnoxious item that can be imagined; and this abomination is suffered to continue year after year, from generation to generation, in the very heart of the most Christian and most polished city in the world.

In 1843, the &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published a petition signed by bankers, salesmen, butchers, aldermen and City residents against further expansion of the meat market, arguing that livestock markets had been systematically banned since the Middle Ages in other areas of London: 

Our ancestors appear, in sanitary matters, to have been wiser than we are. There exists, amongst the Rolls of Parliament of the year 1380, a petition from the citizens of London, praying – that, for the sake of the public health, meat should not be slaughtered nearer than &quot;Knyghtsbrigg&quot;, under penalty, not only of forfeiting such animals as might be killed in the &quot;butcherie&quot;, but of a year&#x27;s imprisonment. The prayer of this petition was granted, audits penalties were enforced during several reigns.

Thomas Hood wrote in 1830 an &quot;Ode to the Advocates for the Removal of Smithfield Market&quot;, applauding those &quot;philanthropic men&quot; who aim at removing to a distance the &quot;vile Zoology&quot; of the market and &quot;routing that great nest of Hornithology [sic]&quot;. Charles Dickens criticised locating a livestock market in the heart of the capital in his 1851 essay &quot;&quot; drawing comparisons with the French market at Poissy outside Paris:

Of a great Institution like Smithfield, [the French] are unable to form the least conception. A Beast Market in the heart of Paris would be regarded an impossible nuisance. Nor have they any notion of slaughter-houses in the midst of a city. One of these benighted frog-eaters would scarcely understand your meaning, if you told him of the existence of such a British bulwark.

An Act of Parliament was passed in 1852, under the provisions of which a new cattle market should be constructed at Copenhagen Fields, Islington. The Metropolitan Cattle Market opened in 1855, leaving West Smithfield as waste ground for about ten years during the construction of the new market.

===Victorian Smithfield: meat and poultry market===


The present Smithfield meat market on Charterhouse Street was established by act of Parliament, the (23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. cxciii). It is a large market with permanent buildings, designed by architect Sir Horace Jones, who also designed Billingsgate and Leadenhall markets. Work on the &quot;Central Market&quot;, inspired by Italian architecture, began in 1866 and was completed in November 1868 at a cost of £993,816 (£ as of ).

The Grade II listed main wings (known as &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West Market&quot;) are separated by the &quot;Grand Avenue&quot;, a wide roadway roofed by an elliptical arch with decorations in cast iron. At the two ends of the arcade, four prominent statues represent London, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Dublin; they depict bronze dragons charged with the City&#x27;s armorial bearings. At the corners of the market, four octagonal pavilion towers were built, each with a dome displaying carved stone griffins.

As the market was being built, a cut and cover railway tunnel was constructed below street level to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel. Closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcasses to its cold store, and directly up to the meat market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s. They are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road.

The first extension of Smithfield&#x27;s meat market took place between 1873 and 1876 with the construction of the &quot;Poultry Market&quot; immediately west of the Central Market. A rotunda was built at the centre of the old Market Field (now West Smithfield), comprising gardens, a fountain and a ramped carriageway to the station beneath the market building. Further buildings were subsequently added to the market. The &quot;General Market&quot;, built between 1879 and 1883, was intended to replace the old Farringdon Market located nearby and established for the sale of fruit and vegetables when the earlier Fleet Market was cleared to enable the laying out of Farringdon Street between 1826–1830.

A further block (also known as &quot;Annexe Market&quot; or &quot;Triangular Block&quot;,) consisting of two separate structures (the &quot;Fish Market&quot; and the &quot;Red House&quot;), was built between 1886 and 1899. The &quot;Fish Market&quot;, built by John Mowlem &amp; Co., was completed in 1888, one year after Sir Horace Jones&#x27; death. The &quot;Red House&quot;, with its imposing red brick and Portland stone façade, was built between 1898 and 1899 for the &quot;London Central Markets Cold Storage Co. Ltd.&quot;. It was one of the first cold stores to be built outside the London docks and continued to serve Smithfield Market until the mid-1970s.

=== 20th century ===

During the Second World War, a large underground cold store at Smithfield was the theatre of secret experiments led by Dr Max Perutz on pykrete, a mixture of ice and woodpulp, believed to be possibly tougher than steel. Perutz&#x27;s work, inspired by Geoffrey Pyke and part of Project Habakkuk, was meant to test the viability of pykrete as a material to construct floating airstrips in the Atlantic to allow refuelling of cargo planes in support of Admiral the Earl Mountbatten&#x27;s operations. The experiments were carried out by Perutz and his colleagues in a refrigerated meat locker in a Smithfield Market butcher&#x27;s basement, behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses. These experiments became obsolete with the development of longer-range aircraft, resulting in abandonment of the project.

Towards the very end of the Second World War, a V-2 rocket struck the north side of Charterhouse Street, near the junction with Farringdon Road (1945). The explosion caused massive damage to the market buildings, affected the railway tunnel structure below, and caused more than 110 deaths.

On 23 January 1958, a fire broke out in the basement of Union Cold Storage Co at the Smithfield Poultry Market. The fire spread throughout the maze of basements under the market and burned for three days. Over 1,700 fire fighters with 389 fire engines were required to bring the blaze under control. Two firefighters were killed and 50 were injured or treated for smoke inhalation. The market was largely destroyed, and large portions not directly affected by fire collapsed as basements caved in. The introduction of breathing apparatus by the London Fire Brigade was a direct result of the fire. 

A red plaque commemorating the two firefighters who died was unveiled at the market on the 60th anniversary of the fire. A replacement building was designed by Sir Thomas Bennett in 1962–63, with a reinforced concrete frame, and external cladding of dark blue brick. It is Grade II listed. The main hall is covered by an enormous concrete dome, shaped as an elliptical paraboloid, spanning by and only thick at the centre. The dome is believed to have been the largest concrete shell structure built at that time in Europe.

=== Today ===

Smithfield is the City of London&#x27;s only major wholesale market (Leadenhall Market nowadays attracts more tourist trade) which has escaped relocation out of central London to cheaper land, better transport links, and more modern facilities. (Covent Garden, Spitalfields and Billingsgate have all relocated). The market operates to supply inner City butchers, shops and restaurants with quality fresh meat, and so its main trading hours are 4:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon each weekday. Instead of moving away, Smithfield Market continues to modernise its existing site: its imposing Victorian buildings have had access points added for the loading and unloading of lorries.

The buildings stand above a warren of tunnels: previously, live animals were brought to market by hoof (from the mid-19th century onwards they arrived by rail) and were slaughtered on site. The former railway tunnels are now used for storage, parking and as basements. An impressive cobbled ramp spirals down around West Smithfield&#x27;s public garden, on the south side of the market, providing access to part of this area. Some of the buildings on Charterhouse Street on Smithfield&#x27;s north side maintain access to the tunnels via their basements.

Some of the former meat market buildings have now changed use. For example, the former Central Cold Store, on Charterhouse Street is now, most unusually, a city centre cogeneration power station operated by Citigen. The Metropolitan Cold Stores was converted in 1999 into the nightclub Fabric and the &#x27;Smiths&#x27; of Smithfield bars and restaurants.

Smithfield comprises the market as its central feature, surrounded by many old buildings on three sides and a public open space (or Rotunda Garden) at West Smithfield, beneath which there is a public car park. The south side is occupied by St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital (known as &quot;Barts&quot; in common parlance), and on the east side by the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great. The Church of St Bartholomew the Less is located next to the King Henry VIII Gate, the hospital&#x27;s main entrance.

The north and south of the square are now closed to through traffic, as part of the City&#x27;s security and surveillance cordon known as the &quot;Ring of steel&quot;. Security for the market is provided by its market constabulary.

===Closure===
====Abandoned plans for relocation to Dagenham====
In early 2019, the City of London Corporation&#x27;s main decision-making body, the Court of Common Council, proposed that Billingsgate Fish Market, New Spitalfields Market and Smithfield Market should move to a new consolidated site in Dagenham Dock. A formal planning application was made in June 2020, and received outline permission in March 2021. However, in November 2024, the council announced it did not intend to proceed with these plans as they were no longer economically viable; the £800M cost was deemed too expensive

====2028 closure====
The City of London Corporation announced in November 2024 that Smithfield market, along with Billingsgate Fish Market, would close in or after 2028 with no replacement. A deal was struck between the Corporation and a group of traders, who would receive £150M in compensation, and would not protest the closure.

===Demolition and development plans===

Since 2005, the &quot;General Market&quot; (1883) and the adjacent &quot;Fish Market&quot; and &quot;Red House&quot; buildings (1898), part of the Victorian complex of the Smithfield Market, have been facing a threat of demolition. The City of London Corporation, ultimate owners of the property, has been engaged in public consultation to assess how best to redevelop their disused property and regenerate the area. Former property developers Thornfield Properties had planned to demolish the historic site and build a seven-storey office block, offering of office space, with a retail outlet on the ground floor.

Several campaigns, promoted by English Heritage and Save Britain&#x27;s Heritage among others, were run to raise public awareness of this part of London&#x27;s Victorian heritage. Grade II listed building protection was approved for the &quot;Red House Cold Store&quot; building in 2005 by then-Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell, on the basis of new historical evidence qualifying the complex as &quot;the earliest existing example of a purpose-built powered cold store&quot;.

Whilst the market continues to trade, its future remains unclear following government Planning Minister Ruth Kelly&#x27;s instigating a major public inquiry in 2007. The public inquiry for the demolition and redevelopment of the General Market Building took place between 6 November 2007 and 25 January 2008. In August 2008, Communities Secretary Hazel Blears announced that planning permission for the General Market&#x27;s redevelopment had been refused, stating that the threatened buildings made &quot;a significant contribution&quot; to the character and appearance of Farringdon and the surrounding area.

On 12 October 2012, Henderson Group unveiled its £160 million-plan for redeveloping the western side of the Central Market. Henderson proposed that the fish market, General Market and Red House buildings, all over a century old, be demolished to make way for restaurants, retailers and office buildings, while they would restore and retain much of the market building&#x27;s original perimeter walls, with a new piazza being created in the General Market. Marcus Binney of the campaign group Save Britain&#x27;s Heritage said: &quot;This proposal constitutes the worst mutilation of a Victorian landmark in the last 30 years.&quot;

Some of the buildings on Lindsey Street opposite the East Market were demolished in 2010 to allow the construction of the new Elizabeth line station at Farringdon. The demolished buildings include &quot;Smithfield House&quot; (an early 20th-century unlisted Hennebique concrete building), the &quot;Edmund Martin Ltd.&quot; shop (an earlier building with alterations dating to the 1930s), and two Victorian warehouses behind them.

In March 2015, the Museum of London revealed plans to vacate its Barbican site at 150 London Wall and move into the General Market Building. The Barbican site closed on 4 December 2022, to prepare for the subsequent move. The foundation stone for its new West Smithfield site was unveiled on 16 October 2023, with the reopening of the museum at the new site still planned for 2026.

===Words and phrases===
*&quot;Smithfield bargain&quot; originally referred to a deal in which the purchaser was exploited. The term later came to mean (in reference to the meat market) a marriage of convenience, one to the groom&#x27;s financial benefit. In this context it was also known as a &quot;Smithfield Match&quot;. Still later the term came to be used to refer to improper dealings, such as when MPs allowed their vote to be bought.
* &quot;Smithfield Races&quot;, an alternative name for the old horse market. It originated in the distant past, when there was horse racing at Smithfield. Although the racing ceased as the surrounding area steadily developed, the name continued to be used for a long time afterwards.

<text>Matchmaking is the process of pairing two or more people together, usually for the purpose of marriage, in which case the intermediary or matchmaker is also known as a marriage broker. Matchmaking may be done as a profession for a fee or it may be done by clergy.

The term is also used in the context of other analogous pairing activities, such as with sporting events such as boxing, in business, online video games and in pairing organ donors.

==Practice==

In some cultures, the role of the matchmaker was and is quite professionalised, and matchmakers charge a fee.
===Jewish cultures===
Historically in Ashkenazi Jewish families, a professional marriage broker, called a shadchan, used “gossip and a corresponding sense of discretion” to “diplomatically scop[e] out the pool of possibilities and securing alliances between families—for a fee.” Shadchans, who could be men or women, ”functioned like good-will ambassadors” between families. By the late 19th and early 20th century, the shadchan lost their social standing and they were “vilified for having commercialized affairs of the heart”, and they became ridiculed in literature for their “guile” and they were seen as symbols of an “outmoded” way of life. By the late 1930s the “Jewish marriage maven became more of a curiosity” than a serious element of matchmaking in the United States.
===Other cultures ===
The Hindu astrologer were often thought to be essential advisors and also helped in finding right spouses as they had links and a relation of good faith with the families. In cultures where arranged marriages were the rule, the astrologer used stars to sanctify matches that both parents approved of. Tarot divination has also been employed by some matchmakers.

Social dance, especially in frontier North America, the contra dance and square dance, has also been employed in matchmaking, usually informally. However, when farming families were widely separated and kept all children on the farm working, marriage-age children could often only meet in church or in such mandated social events. Matchmakers, acting as formal chaperones or as self-employed &quot;busybodies&quot; attended such events and advise families of burgeoning romances.

The influence of such people in a culture that did not arrange marriages, and in which economic relationships (e.g. &quot;being able to support a family&quot;, &quot;good prospects&quot;) played a larger role in determining if a (male) suitor was acceptable, is difficult to determine.

Clergy probably played a key role in most Western cultures, as they continue to do in modern ones, especially where they are the most trusted mediators in the society. Matchmaking was certainly one of the peripheral functions of the village priest in Medieval Catholic society, as well as a duty of rabbis in traditional Jewish communities. Today, the shidduch is a system of matchmaking in which Jewish singles are introduced to one another in Orthodox Jewish communities.

In the 2010s and 2020s there has been a resurgence of interest in traditional matchmaking. Dissatisfaction with dating apps, television shows like &quot;Million Dollar Matchmaker&quot; and &quot;Indian Matchmaking&quot;, and a pandemic that made it harder for singles to meet organically created increased interest the role of the professional matchmaker. Those who find dating systems or services useful but prefer human intelligence and personal touches can choose from a wide range of such services now available. These services may rely on personality tests (but genetics has even been proposed), aiming to maximize the identification of the best match. 
===In Asia===
In Singapore, the Social Development Unit (SDU), run by the city-state&#x27;s government, offers a combination of professional counsel and dating system technology, like many commercial dating services. Thus the role of the matchmaker has become institutionalized, as a bureaucrat, and every citizen in Singapore has access to some subset of the matchmaking services that were once reserved for royalty or upper classes.

As of July 2023, there were 50 Iranian dating agencies according to Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance.

==Other uses==
===Business===
The concept of matchmaking is also used in the business world, as the analogous goal of pairing compatible partners is used. It may be called business to business (B2B) matchmaking, investor matchmaking, business speed dating, or brokerage events. In contradiction to social networking approaches, in-person meetings between business people are used. Trade fair organisations find this concept an added value for their exhibitors because it gives them the opportunity of advanced planned meetings. Following the inspiration of dating sites, some online B2B networking platforms developed business matching approaches people to identify potential business partners.

===Sports and recreation===
Some sports leagues have matchmaking services to help players of sports find compatible playing partners.

<text>Crewe and Nantwich was, from 1974 to 2009, a local government district with borough status in Cheshire, England. It had a population (2001 census) of 111,007. It contained 69 civil parishes and one unparished area: the town of Crewe. It now forms part of the unitary authority of Cheshire East.

==History==
The Borough of Crewe and Nantwich was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 by the merger of the borough of Crewe (an industrial town), the urban district of Nantwich (a smaller market town), and Nantwich Rural District. The new district was proposed to be called just &quot;Crewe&quot;, but the shadow authority elected in 1973 to oversee the transition to the new system successfully petitioned the government to change the name to &quot;Crewe and Nantwich&quot; before the district came into being. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor.

In 2006 the Department for Communities and Local Government considered reorganising Cheshire&#x27;s administrative structure as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. The decision to merge the boroughs of Crewe and Nantwich, Congleton and Macclesfield to create a single unitary authority was announced on 25 July 2007, following a consultation period in which a proposal to create a single Cheshire unitary authority was rejected.

The Borough of Crewe and Nantwich was abolished on 1 April 2009, when the new Cheshire East unitary authority was formed.

==Civil parishes==
The former Crewe Municipal Borough was unparished, but the rest of the Crewe and Nantwich district included the following civil parishes:
==Political control==
The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 2009 was held by the following parties: 

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council from 1974 were:

On 4 May 2006 a referendum was held to decide whether the &quot;Leader and Cabinet&quot; form of local government would be replaced by an elected mayor. The proposal was rejected by 18,768 (60.8%) votes to 11,808 (38.2%) on a 35.3% turnout.

===Premises===

The council met at the Municipal Buildings in Earle Street, Crewe, which had been completed for the former Crewe Borough Council in 1905. The main administrative offices were at Delamere House on Delamere Street in Crewe, which was built as a joint facility for both the new Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council and Cheshire County Council, being completed in 1974 just before local government reorganisation took effect. Delamere House was later supplemented with additional offices in a large extension to the rear of the Municipal Buildings, completed in 1991.

<doc id="186889" wikidata="Q6257309" url="?curid=186889" title="John Sergeant (journalist)">
<text>John James Sergeant (born 14 April 1944) is an English television and radio journalist and broadcaster. He was the BBC&#x27;s chief political correspondent from 1992 to 2000 and the Political Editor of ITN from 2000 until 2002.

==Early life==
The son of a missionary and linguist, Sergeant is of Russian origin on his mother&#x27;s side. Sergeant&#x27;s early life meant that he followed his father&#x27;s work, and was brought up in locations including Jerusalem and Oxford. Sergeant was educated at Great Tew Primary School, briefly at the independent Bloxham School near Banbury, in Oxfordshire, and then at the independent Millfield School in Street, Somerset.

Sergeant graduated from Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics. Whilst at university Sergeant performed in student comedy revues. After graduation he starred with Alan Bennett in a series of sketch shows on the BBC entitled &quot;On the Margin&quot; and wrote comedy scripts. He then trained as a journalist at Darlington College while reporting for the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;.

Whilst in Washington during his &quot;gap year&quot; he was present in the crowd to witness Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in 1963.

==Career==
Sergeant started his journalism career as a correspondent for the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; where he worked for around three years before joining the BBC as a radio reporter in 1970. He was tasked to join the international desk, covering stories in over 25 countries. He then worked as a war reporter in Vietnam and Israel and reported the death of the first British soldier during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. He later covered the opening sessions of the European Parliament and became a political correspondent in 1981. He then worked on a documentary called &quot;The Europe We Joined&quot; and has presented BBC Radio 4 programmes &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;The World at One&quot;. Having progressed through newspaper, radio and television journalism, he became the BBC&#x27;s chief political correspondent from 1992 until 2000.

In 2000, Sergeant joined ITN as political editor, replacing the retiring Michael Brunson. Sergeant retired himself in 2002 and was replaced at ITN by Nick Robinson.

===Highlights===
In 1987, in Moscow following Margaret Thatcher, he made a comment implying that she had already started campaigning for the general election in June 1987, despite not having officially declared the contest. &quot;I am serving my country&quot;, Thatcher replied.

One of his most memorable moments was when he waited outside the British embassy in Paris for Thatcher, in the hope of hearing her reaction to the first ballot in the 1990 Conservative leadership election, only to be pushed aside by her press secretary, Sir Bernard Ingham, when Thatcher emerged from the building. For this broadcast, Sergeant won the British Press Guild award for the most memorable broadcast of the year, beating Paul Gascoigne who had been nominated for bursting into tears during the Football World Cup semi-final against West Germany.

Another political scoop was gained when he was granted the only interview with the then Welsh secretary, Ron Davies, after he had been forced to resign following his &quot;moment of madness&quot; on Clapham Common in October 1998.

===&quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;===

Sergeant competed with partner Kristina Rihanoff in the sixth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; which began on 20 September 2008. Although he repeatedly finished bottom of the score board after the judges&#x27; votes, the public consistently voted to keep him in the competition, prompting criticism of the viewers&#x27; voting by the judges and some dancers. He left the show in week 10 following a farewell dance saying: &quot;The trouble is that there is now a real danger that I might win the competition. Even for me that would be a joke too far.&quot;

===After &quot;Strictly&quot;===
Sergeant has appeared on television programmes such as &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. He was also a reporter for &quot;The One Show&quot;; when the hosts Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley were on holiday, Sergeant hosted the show alongside Myleene Klass for a week starting on 24 August 2009. Sergeant has been a guest in &quot;Countdown&quot;″s Dictionary Corner with Susie Dent. In February 2009, he appeared on &quot;QI&quot; (series F, episode 10). In 2014, he became the narrator for the UK version of the interesting facts game programme, &quot;Duck Quacks Don&#x27;t Echo&quot;, first series only.

Sergeant has since subsequently been engaged by Mentorn TV to produce a number of documentaries that include a three-part series entitled &quot;John Sergeant&#x27;s Tourist Trail&quot; in which he asked the question &quot;why do tourists come to Britain?&quot; In 2013 Sergeant presented &quot;Tracks of Empire&quot;, a two-part documentary produced by Mentorn for the BBC, on the history and legacy of the Indian railway system, in which he followed the path of the early railway engineers of British India and also discussed the use of the railways in the extensive growth of India now. He was also the host of &quot;Argumental&quot;, a comedy debating game on Dave. In 2011 he was the narrator for the ITV television series &quot;Grimefighters&quot;.

Sergeant presented &quot;Britain&#x27;s First Photo Album&quot; about the pioneering photography of Francis Frith. It aired 12–23 March 2012 on BBC Two. Frith travelled through Britain in Victorian times capturing life in photographic form; many of his pictures were subsequently sold as picture postcards.

In 2015, Sergeant began presenting the factual ITV series &quot;Barging Round Britain with John Sergeant&quot; (also shown under the alternative title &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Canals with John Sergeant&quot;). The programme returned for a second series in April 2016.

In 2023, Sergeant appeared in the Channel 5 series &quot;The Big Steam Adventure&quot; alongside Peter Davison and steam buff Paul &quot;Piglet&quot; Middleton.

==Personal life==
Whilst appearing on the ITV game show &quot;The Chase&quot;, Sergeant made clear the one memory he has over his many years of experience in broadcasting is when he was a young man working in Washington, D.C.; he heard Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s 1963 speech &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; live, at the Lincoln Memorial.

He was president of the Johnson Society in 2003. Interviewed by Sophie Lam in &quot;The Independent&quot; in June 2008 about his holiday memories, he stated: &quot;I&#x27;m programmed not to be disappointed by holidays.&quot; He has two sons, Will and Mike: the latter is also a journalist, working at the BBC as a reporter. Sergeant once saved his son&#x27;s life after Mike began choking on a 50p coin at a restaurant aged two. Sergeant managed to dislodge the coin with his first aid knowledge.

Sergeant was presented with an honorary doctor of letters by University of Lincoln chancellor Victor Adebowale on 3 September 2013 at in Lincoln Cathedral.

<text>Nantwich ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East in Cheshire, England. It has among the highest concentrations of listed buildings in England, with notably good examples of Tudor and Georgian architecture. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 14,045 and the built up area had a population of 18,740.

==History==
The origins of the settlement date to Roman times, when salt from Nantwich was used by the Roman garrisons at Chester (Deva Victrix) and Stoke-on-Trent as a preservative and a condiment. Salt has been used in the production of Cheshire cheese and in the tanning industry, both products of the dairy industry based in the Cheshire Plain around the town. &quot;Nant&quot; comes from the Welsh for brook or stream. &quot;Wich&quot; and &quot;wych&quot; are names used to denote brine springs or wells. In 1194 there is a reference to the town as being called &quot;Nametwihc&quot;, which would indicate it was once the site of a pre-Roman Celtic nemeton or sacred grove.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Nantwich is recorded as having eight salt houses. It had a castle and was the capital of a barony of the earls of Chester, and of one of the seven hundreds of medieval Cheshire. Nantwich is one of the few places in Cheshire to be marked on the Gough Map, which dates from 1355 to 1366. It was first recorded as an urban area at the time of the Norman Conquest, when the Normans burnt the town to the ground, leaving only one building standing.

Nantwich Castle was built at the crossing of the Weaver before 1180, probably near where the Crown Inn now stands. Although nothing remains of the castle above ground, it affected the town&#x27;s layout. During the medieval period, Nantwich was the most important salt town and probably the second most important settlement in the county after Chester. By the 14th century, it was holding a weekly cattle market at the end of what is now Beam Street, and it was also important for its tanning industry centred in Barker Street.
A fire in December 1583 destroyed most of the town to the east of the Weaver. Elizabeth I contributed funds to the town&#x27;s rebuilding and made an England-wide appeal for support for the rebuilding fund which thereby received funds from many successful medieval towns, including Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. The rebuilding occurred rapidly and followed the plan of the destroyed town. Beam Street was so renamed to reflect the fact that timber (including wood from Delamere Forest) to rebuild the town was transported along it. A plaque marking the 400th anniversary of the fire and of Nantwich&#x27;s rebuilding was unveiled by the Duke of Gloucester on 20 September 1984.

From the time of the Henrician Reformation, the town had trouble finding good Protestant preachers. An example of the problem was Stephen Jerome, a puritanical preacher, who in 1625 nonetheless tried to rape one of his maidservants, Margaret Knowsley. Rumours of this spread across the town, eventually leading to Knowsley&#x27;s imprisonment and public shaming in 1627. A few years later, Jerome went to Ireland to continue his preaching career.

During the English Civil War Nantwich declared for Parliament and was besieged several times by Royalist forces. A final six-week siege was lifted after a Parliamentary victory in the Battle of Nantwich on 26 January 1644. This has been re-enacted as &quot;Holly Holy Day&quot; on every anniversary since 1973 by Sealed Knot, an educational charity. The name is taken from commemorative sprigs of holly worn by townsfolk in caps or on clothing in the years after the battle.

The salt industry peaked in the mid-16th century, with about 400 salt houses in 1530, but had almost died out by the end of the 18th century; the last salt house closed in the mid-19th century. Nikolaus Pevsner considered the salt-industry decline to have been critical in preserving the town&#x27;s historic buildings. The last tannery closed in 1974. The town&#x27;s location on the London–Chester road meant that Nantwich began to serve the needs of travellers in medieval times. This trade declined in the 19th century with the opening of Telford&#x27;s road from London to Holyhead, which offered a faster route to Wales, and later with the Grand Junction Railway, which bypassed the town.

===Nantwich Mill===
The presence of a watermill south of Nantwich Bridge was noted in 1228 and again about 1363, through the cutting of a mill race or leat and creation of an upstream weir. The resulting Mill Island was ascribed to the 16th century, possibly after the original mill was destroyed in the 1583 Great Fire of Nantwich.

In the mid-17th century, the mill was acquired by local landowners, the Cholmondeleys, who retained it until the 1840s. Originally a corn mill, it became a cotton mill (Bott&#x27;s Mill) from 1789 to 1874, but reverted to being a corn mill and was recorded as such on the Ordnance Survey First Edition map of Nantwich in 1876. A turbine was installed in about 1890 to replace the water wheel.

The mill was demolished in the 1970s after a fire and then landscaped, with further stabilisation of the mill foundations in 2008. Today it forms part of a riverside park area. Proposals, so far unfollowed, have been made for small-scale hydropower generation using the mill race. Nantwich Mill Hydro Generation Ltd was incorporated in April 2009, but dormant in December 2016.

===Brine baths===
Nantwich&#x27;s brine springs were used for spa or hydrotherapy purposes at two locations: the central Snow Hill swimming pool inaugurated in 1883, where the open-air brine pool is still in use, and the Brine Baths Hotel, standing in 70 acres (28 ha) of parkland south of the town from the 1890s to the mid-20th century. The hotel was originally a mansion, Shrewbridge Hall, built for Michael Bott (owner of Nantwich Mill) in 1828. It was bought by Nantwich Brine and Medicinal Baths Company in 1883, extended and opened as a hotel in 1893, with &quot;a well-appointed suite of brine and medicinal baths,&quot; – also described as the &quot;strongest saline baths in the world&quot;. These were used to treat patients with ailments that included gout, rheumatism, sciatica and neuritis, using two suites of baths.

The hotel&#x27;s grounds included gardens, tennis courts, a nine-hole golf course and a bowling green. The last survives today as the Nantwich Park Road Bowling Club founded in 1906.

The hotel served as an auxiliary hospital during the First World War. In the Second World War it became an army base and then accommodated WAAF personnel. It closed as a hotel in 1947 and in 1948 became a convalescent home for miners. In 1952 that closed and the building was unsuccessfully put up for sale and demolished in 1959. The grounds were later developed for housing – the Brine Baths Estate – and schools (Brine Leas School and Weaver Primary School).

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Nantwich, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Nantwich Town Council and Cheshire East Council. The town council is based at the Civic Hall on Market Street. Parts of the built up area extend into neighbouring parishes, notably Stapeley and District to the south-east.

For national elections, the town is mostly in the Crewe and Nantwich constituency. Some western parts of Nantwich are in the Chester South and Eddisbury constituency. A Nantwich constituency covering the town and surrounding rural areas existed between 1955 and 1983.

===Administrative history===
Nantwich was anciently part of the parish of Acton. Nantwich had a chapel of ease from at least the 12th century, which was rebuilt as the current St Mary&#x27;s Church in the 14th century. It is unclear exactly when Nantwich became a separate parish from Acton, although it was treated as a separate parish by 1677.

The parish of Nantwich contained the townships of Alvaston, Leighton and Woolstanwood, as well as a Nantwich township covering the town itself and adjoining areas, plus western fringes of the township of Willaston. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Nantwich, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so the townships also became civil parishes.

In 1850, the Nantwich township was also made a local board district, administered by an elected local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The urban district was enlarged in 1936, taking in areas from several neighbouring parishes.

Nantwich Urban District Council moved its offices to Brookfield House on Shrewbridge Road in 1949. It also built the Civic Hall on Market Street to serve as an public hall and entertainment venue, opening in 1951. The town&#x27;s previous main public hall had been the privately owned Town Hall beside Nantwich Bridge on the High Street, which was built in 1868 and closed by 1945; it was demolished in 1972.

Nantwich Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the larger borough of Crewe and Nantwich, also covering the nearby town of Crewe and surrounding rural areas. The government originally proposed calling the new borough Crewe, but the shadow authority elected in 1973 to oversee the transition changed the name to &#x27;Crewe and Nantwich&#x27; before the new arrangements came into effect. A successor parish covering the area of the former Nantwich Urban District was created at the same time, with its parish council taking the name Nantwich Town Council.

In 2009, Cheshire East Council was created, taking over the functions of Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished.

==Places of interest==
Nantwich has one of the county&#x27;s largest collections of historic buildings, second only to Chester. These cluster mainly in the town centre on Barker Street, Beam Street, Churchyard Side, High Street and Hospital Street, and extend across the Weaver on Welsh Row. Most are within the of conservation area, which broadly follows the bounds of the late medieval and early post-medieval town.

The oldest listed building is the 14th-century St Mary&#x27;s Church, which is listed Grade I. Two other listed buildings are known to predate the fire of 1583: Sweetbriar Hall and the Grade I-listed Churche&#x27;s Mansion, both timber-framed Elizabethan mansion houses. A few years after the fire, William Camden described Nantwich as the &quot;best built town in the county&quot;. Particularly fine timber-framed buildings from the town&#x27;s rebuilding include 46 High Street and the Grade I-listed Crown coaching inn. Many half-timbered buildings, such as 140–142 Hospital Street, have been concealed behind brick or rendering. Nantwich contains many Georgian town houses, good examples being Dysart Buildings, 9 Mill Street, Townwell House and 83 Welsh Row. Several examples of Victorian corporate architecture are listed, including the former District Bank by Alfred Waterhouse. The most recent listed building is 1–5 Pillory Street, a curved corner block in 17th-century French style, which dates from 1911. Most of the town&#x27;s listed buildings were originally residential, but churches, chapels, public houses, schools, banks, almshouses and workhouses are represented. Unusual listed structures include a mounting block, twelve cast-iron bollards, a stone gateway, two garden walls and a summerhouse.

Dorfold Hall is a Grade I listed Jacobean mansion in the nearby village of Acton, considered by Pevsner to be one of the two finest Jacobean houses in Cheshire. Its grounds accommodate Nantwich Show each summer, including, until 2021, the International Cheese Awards.

Nantwich Museum, in Pillory Street, has galleries on the history of the town, including Roman salt-making, Tudor Nantwich&#x27;s Great Fire, the Civil War Battle of Nantwich (1644) and the more recent shoe, clothing and local cheese-making industries. Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker, a few miles outside the town, is a once government-owned nuclear bunker, now a museum. Also in Pillory St is the 82-seat Nantwich Players Theatre, which puts on about five plays a year.

The Nantwich Millennium Clock, located in Cocoa Yard between Pillory Street and Hospital Street, is an art installation with a free-standing mechanical clock inside a glass case. The clock was made by Paul Beckett around 2001 to celebrate the new millennium.

The name of Jan Palach Avenue in the south of the town commemorates the self-immolation of a student in Czechoslovakia in 1969.

==Geography==

Nantwich is on the Cheshire Plain, on the banks of the River Weaver. The Shropshire Union Canal runs to the west of the town on an embankment, crossing the Acton lane on the western boundary of the town via an iron aqueduct. There is a basin nearby which is a frequent mooring for visitors20 to the town. It joins the Llangollen Canal at Hurleston to the north. The town is some south-west of Crewe, miles south-east of Chester and east of Wrexham. The town is served by a by-pass to the north and west into which, directly or indirectly, the A51, A500, A529, A530 and A534 roads all feed.

The stretch of A534 from Nantwich to the Welsh border is seen as one of the ten worst stretches of road in England for road safety.

The tower of St Mary&#x27;s Church was the origin (meridian) of the 6-inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps of Cheshire.

==Public transport==
Nantwich railway station is on the line from Crewe to Whitchurch, Shrewsbury and other towns along the Welsh border. It is served mainly by stopping trains between Crewe and Shrewsbury.

D&amp;G Bus, Stagecoach and Mikro Coaches operate bus routes from Nantwich Bus Station and in and around Nantwich, some with funding from Cheshire East council.

==Education==
The town has eight primary schools (Highfields Community, Willaston Primary Academy, Millfields, Pear Tree, St Anne&#x27;s (Catholic), Stapeley Broad Lane (Church of England), The Weaver and Nantwich Primary Academy) and two secondary schools, Brine Leas School and Malbank School and Sixth Form College. Reaseheath College runs further education and higher education courses in conjunction with Harper Adams University and the University of Chester. A sixth-form college at Brine Leas opened in September 2010.

For the London 2012 Olympic Games, Malbank School and Sixth Form College was nominated to represent the North West.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s football club, Nantwich Town, competes in and in 2006 won the FA Vase. It plays at the Weaver Stadium, opened in 2007.

Rugby union is played at two clubs. Crewe and Nantwich RUFC, founded in 1922, is based at Vagrants Sports Club in Newcastle Road, Willaston, and runs four senior teams including a ladies team; the first XV play in the Midlands 1 West (Level 6). It holds Club Mark and RFU Seal of Approval accreditations and has a mini and junior section of over 250 young people aged 5–18 taking part every Sunday, with a girls section. Acton Nomads RFC, founded in 2009, won the 2010 RFU Presidents XV &quot;This is Rugby&quot; Award; it operates two senior sides.

In rugby league, Crewe &amp; Nantwich Steamers play at the Barony Park, Nantwich, also the home ground for Acton Nomads RFC.

The town&#x27;s cricket club in Whitehouse Lane won the ECB-accredited Cheshire County Premier League title in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2018. It regularly hosts Cheshire Minor County cricket matches. Midway through the 2017 season, bowler Jimmy Warrington became the first player in the history of the Cheshire County Premier League to take 500 wickets. In 2019, Nantwich reached the final of the ECB National Club Cricket Championship. In the final, played at Lord&#x27;s, it met Swardeston and lost by 53 runs.

==Media==
The daily &quot;Sentinel&quot;, weekly &quot;Nantwich Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Crewe and Nantwich Guardian&quot;, and monthly &quot;Dabber&quot; cover the town.

Local TV coverage is provided by BBC North West and ITV from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Radio stations for the Nantwich area include BBC Radio Stoke, Cheshire&#x27;s Silk Radio from Macclesfield, Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire and Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire from Stoke-on-Trent, Crewe-based The Cat 107.9 community radio, and Nantwich-based online radio and networking organisation RedShift Radio.

&quot;The Nantwich News&quot; is a hyperlocal blog for local events and issues. The &quot;inNantwich&quot; website gives Nantwich information, including shops, firms, schools, wifi spots, car parking and toilets.

==Events==
===Cheese awards===
Until 2019, the annual International Cheese Awards were held in July each year during Nantwich Show, at the Dorfold Hall estate. In 2021 it was announced the Awards would be moving to the Staffordshire Show Grounds and would no longer be part of the Nantwich Show event.

===Jazz and blues===
Since 1996, Nantwich has hosted an annual Nantwich Jazz and Blues Festival over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend. Jazz and blues artists from around the country perform in pubs and venues.

===Food festival===
The annual Nantwich Food Festival is held in the town centre on the first weekend of September.

<text>Dating game shows are game shows that incorporates a variety of matchmaking systems and services in the form of a game with clear rules. Human matchmaking is involved only in selecting the game&#x27;s contestants, who are usually selected more for the amusement value than any concern for their happiness or compatibility. The audience sees only the game; an important feature of all dating game shows is that the contestants have little or no previous knowledge of each other, and are exposed to each other only through the game, which may include viewing a photograph or at least knowing the basic criteria for participation (typically participants are not already married).

There have been a number of dating shows aired on television over the years, using a variety of formats and rules. They are presented for the entertainment of the viewers. As the genre progressed, the format developed towards a reality-style show and more into a relationship show than simply finding a mate.

==History==
The dating game show subgenre has its origins in the United States. The original dating game shows were introduced by television producer and game show creator Chuck Barris. The format of Barris&#x27;s first dating show, &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, which premiered in 1965, saw a bachelor or bachelorette ask questions of three singles seen only by the audience. The various suitors were able to describe their rivals in uncomplimentary ways, which made the show work well as a general devolution of dignity. Some of the questions were written to elicit humorous or suggestive answers. Another Barris show, &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, featured recently married couples competing to answer questions about each other&#x27;s preferences. The couple who knew each other the best would win the game; sometimes others got divorced. Once, someone divorced after appearing on &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; got a &quot;second chance&quot; on &quot;The Dating Game&quot;. Gimmicks were the lifeblood of all such shows, which drew criticisms for instigating disaffection that could not have been effected.

The genre waned for a while but it was later revived by &quot;The New Dating Game&quot; and the UK version &quot;Blind Date&quot;, and the original shows were popular in reruns, unusual for any game show. Cable television revived some interest in these shows during the 1980s and 1990s, and eventually new shows began to be made along the old concepts. Variations featuring LGBT contestants began to appear on a few specialty channels.

Other shows focused on the conventional , where two people were set up and then captured on video, sometimes with comments or subtitles that made fun of their dating behaviour. &quot;He Said, She Said&quot; focused not on setting up the date, but on comparing the couple&#x27;s different impressions afterwards, and for their cooperation offering to fund a second date. These resembled the reality shows that began to emerge at about the same time in the 1990s.

The increased popularity of reality television since the early 2000s has influenced new types of dating shows, where the emphasis is on realistic actions and tensions, but use less realistic scenarios than the traditional blind date:
*&quot;Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?&quot; (2000) a one-off special with a beauty pageant-like contest to become the bride of a single man, billed as a having a net worth of at least $1 million, whose identity was not revealed until the conclusion of the competition.
*&quot;The Fifth Wheel&quot; (2001), in which four people, two of one sex and two of another, are allowed to meet and bond to an extent, before a &quot;fifth wheel,&quot; a person of one of either gender, but always a heterosexual, enters and attempts to break up the equilibrium.
*&quot;Temptation Island&quot; (2001), where long-standing heterosexual couples were deliberately separated and made to watch each other&#x27;s mates interacting romantically on and after dates, making extensive use of video—the only means by which they could communicate on the island.
*&quot;The Bachelor&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Bachlorette&quot; (2003), where a single man or woman partakes in activities with a larger group of single contestants, eliminating them over the course of the season until one remains.
*&quot;Joe Millionaire&quot; (2003), a series satirizing shows like &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, where a group of women competed to become the bride of a bachelor billed as being a millionaire. However, the bachelor was actually a blue collar worker who wasn&#x27;t a millionaire. If the last remaining woman still accepted his love despite the stunt, they also shared a grand prize of $1 million. A 2022 revival employed two bachelors: one of them was a millionaire, but their identity was not revealed until the conclusion of the competition.
*&quot;Are You the One?&quot; (2014), a series where a group of singles attempt to deduce their &quot;perfect matches&quot; as determined by producers, for a chance to split a cash prize among themselves.
*&quot;Love Island&quot; (2015)&quot;,&quot; a series where a group of male and female singles are isolated at a villa in a vacation setting, attempting to form couples while also competing in challenges to earn advantages and the opportunity to go on dates. Couples may also face elimination via viewer vote

Alongside these reality competitions, there were also other new studio-based formats for dating shows. The 2008 Australian series &quot;Taken Out&quot;, which was exported internationally to other countries under the title &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, featured bachelors discussing aspects of their personality and interests with a large pool of singles. The singles could press a button on their podium to eliminate themselves from contention if they were no longer interested in the bachelor, with the game ending if there are no singles remaining. 

GSN&#x27;s &quot;Baggage&quot; (2010) featured singles presenting personal—and sometimes embarrassing and/or shocking—secrets about themselves (their &quot;baggage&quot;, revealed by opening &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;-like briefcases) to a bachelor or bachelorette. At the end of each episode, the bachelor or bachelorette must present their own &quot;baggage&quot; to the remaining single, who then chooses whether to accept or decline their offer of a date.

==Commonalities==
Some common threads run through these shows. When participants are removed, it is usually done one at a time to drag out the action and get audience sympathy for specific players. In shows involving couples, there is a substantial incentive to break up any of the existing relationships. In shows involving singles, there is a mismatch of numbers ensuring constant competition. This creates the action, tension and humiliation when someone is rejected. There are also reports of mercenary practice, that is, members of one sex paid to participate in the game to attain balance of sex ratio.

==Modern innovations==
By the late 1990s and early 2000s, a new wave of dating shows began airing in U.S. syndication that were more sexually suggestive than their earlier counterparts, including shows such as &quot;Blind Date&quot;, &quot;Elimidate&quot; and &quot;The 5th Wheel&quot;, which often pushed boundaries of sexual content allowed on broadcast television. As the 2000s progressed, the ratings for many of these shows began to decline, a situation exacerbated by the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy in 2004 as production companies out of fear of being imposed with monetary penalties by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for indecent content began self-censoring their dating shows (and many syndicated programs targeted at the 18-49 demographic, in general) to levels in which even profanities typically permissible on television were edited out of episodes.

Since then, the game show has virtually died off from television syndication, though cable television networks such as VH1 have continued to air dating shows with content similar to that of the syndicated dating shows of the late 1990s and early 2000s and major over-the-air broadcast networks have tried, often with marginal success, to use dating shows that are less risque compared to those shows. Attempts to revive the dating show in syndication first came in 2011, when &quot;Excused&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Date a Comedian?&quot; both debuted; this was followed in 2012 by NBCUniversal Television Distribution&#x27;s sale of reruns of the Game Show Network series &quot;Baggage&quot; into syndication. All three shows were dropped in September 2013, removing the genre from broadcast syndication for a time. In July 2014, VH1 aired &quot;Dating Naked&quot;, modeled on Dutch show &quot;Adam Zkt. Eva&quot;, which matches up heterosexual contestants who are nude most of the time.

A popular dating variant of the talk show involved inviting secret admirers to meet on stage. On an episode of &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;, a gay secret admirer publicly revealed his crush on a straight acquaintance; three days after the episode&#x27;s taping, the acquaintance murdered the secret admirer, in which he claimed humiliation over the revelation of a same-sex crush. The secret admirer variant of the talk show has remained popular, and it has continued be used on talk shows such as &quot;Oprah&quot;. Occasional episodes of &quot;Maury&quot; combine this format, though not always in a direct manner, with reveals of high school classmates who were considered to be unattractive as teenagers reuniting with their former school friends or tormentors as adults, after changing their image to become more physically attractive.

==Criticism==
Like other games, the outcomes of these activities are open to rigging, leading to missed matches and possibly unhappiness among the participants. These programs have also been criticised for complicating courtship with needless public expectation. In spite of this, some programs have produced episodes that portray follow-ups of unions forged therein, possibly with offspring.

<doc id="186905" wikidata="Q176465" url="?curid=186905" title="Hedda Gabler">
<text>Hedda Gabler () is a play written by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. The world premiere was staged on 31 January 1891 at the Residenztheater in Munich. Ibsen himself was in attendance, although he remained back-stage. The play has been canonized as a masterpiece within the genres of literary realism, nineteenth century theatre, and world drama. Ibsen mainly wrote realistic plays until his forays into modern drama. &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; dramatizes the experiences of the title character, Hedda, the daughter of a general, who is trapped in a marriage and a house that she does not want. Overall, the title character for &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; is considered one of the great dramatic roles in theater. The year following its publication, the play received negative feedback and reviews. Hedda Gabler has been described as a female variation of Hamlet. 

Hedda&#x27;s married name is Hedda Tesman; Gabler is her maiden name. On the subject of the title, Ibsen wrote: &quot;My intention in giving it this name was to indicate that Hedda as a personality is to be regarded rather as her father&#x27;s daughter than her husband&#x27;s wife.&quot;

==Characters==

* Hedda Tesman (&quot;née&quot; Gabler) — The main character, newly married and bored with both her marriage and life, seeks to influence a human fate for the first time. She is the daughter of General Gabler. She wants luxury but has no funds. 
* George (Jørgen) Tesman — Hedda&#x27;s husband, an academic who is as interested in research and travel as he is enamoured with his wife, although blind to Hedda&#x27;s manipulative ways. Despite George&#x27;s presumed rivalry with Eilert over Hedda, he remains a congenial and compassionate host and even plans to return Eilert&#x27;s manuscript after Eilert loses it in a drunken stupor.
* Juliana (Juliane) Tesman — George&#x27;s loving aunt who has raised him since early childhood. She is also called Aunt Julle in the play, and Aunt Ju-Ju by George. Desperately wants Hedda and her nephew to have a child. In an earlier draft, Ibsen named her Mariane Rising, clearly after his aunt (father&#x27;s younger half-sister) and godmother Mariane Paus who grew up (with Ibsen&#x27;s father) on the stately farm Rising near Skien; while she was later renamed Juliane Tesman, her character was modeled after Mariane Paus.
* Thea Elvsted — A younger schoolmate of Hedda and a former acquaintance of George. Nervous and shy, Thea is in an unhappy marriage.
* Judge Brack — An unscrupulous family friend. It is implied that the Judge has a lascivious personality, which he directs towards Hedda.
* Eilert Lövborg (Ejlert Løvborg) — George&#x27;s former colleague, who now competes with George to achieve publication and a teaching position. Eilert was once in love with Hedda. Destroyed his reputation in society by spending his money on depravity. 
* Bertha (Berte) — A servant of the Tesmans. Wants to please Hedda at all times.

==Plot==

Hedda, the daughter of a general, has just returned to her villa in Kristiania (now Oslo) from her honeymoon. Her husband is George Tesman, a young, aspiring, and reliable academic who continued his research during their honeymoon. It becomes clear in the course of the play that she never loved him, but married him because she thinks her years of youthful abandon are over. 

The reappearance of George&#x27;s academic rival, Eilert Løvborg, throws their lives into disarray. Eilert, a writer, is also a recovered alcoholic who has wasted his talent until now. Thanks to a relationship with Hedda&#x27;s old schoolmate, Thea Elvsted (who has left her husband for him), Eilert shows signs of rehabilitation and has just published a bestseller in the same field as George&#x27;s. When Hedda and Eilert talk privately together, it becomes apparent that they are former lovers.

The critical success of his recently published work makes Eilert a threat to George, as Eilert is now a competitor for the university professorship George had been anticipating. George and Hedda are financially overstretched, and George tells Hedda that he will not be able to finance the regular entertaining or luxurious housekeeping that she had been expecting. Upon meeting Eilert, however, the couple discovers that he has no intention of competing for the professorship, but rather has spent the last few years working on what he considers to be his masterpiece, the &quot;sequel&quot; to his recently published work.

Apparently jealous of Thea&#x27;s influence over Eilert, Hedda hopes to come between them. Despite his drinking problem, she encourages Eilert to accompany George and his associate, Judge Brack, to a party. George returns home from the party and reveals that he found the complete manuscript (the only copy) of Eilert&#x27;s great work, which the latter lost while drunk. George is then called away to his aunt&#x27;s house, leaving the manuscript in Hedda&#x27;s possession. When Eilert next sees Hedda and Thea, he tells them that he has deliberately destroyed the manuscript. Thea is horrified, and it is revealed that it was the joint work of Eilert and herself. Hedda says nothing to contradict Eilert or to reassure Thea. After Thea has left, Hedda encourages Eilert to commit suicide, giving him a pistol that had belonged to her father. She then burns the manuscript and tells George she has destroyed it to secure their future.

When the news comes that Eilert did indeed kill himself, George and Thea are determined to try to reconstruct his book from Eilert&#x27;s notes, which Thea has kept. Hedda is shocked to discover from Judge Brack that Eilert&#x27;s death, in a brothel, was messy and probably accidental; this &quot;ridiculous and vile&quot; death contrasts with the &quot;beautiful and free&quot; one that Hedda had imagined for him. Worse, Brack knows the origins of the pistol. He tells Hedda that if he reveals what he knows, a scandal will likely arise around her. Hedda realizes that this places Brack in a position of power over her. Leaving the others, she goes into her smaller room and shoots herself in the head. The others in the room assume that Hedda is simply firing shots, and they follow the sound to investigate. The play ends with George, Brack, and Thea discovering her body.

==Critical interpretation==
Joseph Wood Krutch makes a connection between &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; and Freud, whose first work on psychoanalysis was published almost a decade later. In Krutch&#x27;s analysis, Gabler is one of the first fully developed neurotic female protagonists of literature. By that, Krutch means that Hedda is neither logical nor insane in the old sense of being random and unaccountable. Her aims and her motives have a secret personal logic of their own. She gets what she wants, but what she wants is not anything that normal people would acknowledge (at least, not publicly) to be desirable. One of the significant things that such a character implies is the premise that there is a secret, sometimes unconscious, world of aims and methods — one might almost say a secret system of values — that is often much more important than the rational one. It is regarded as a deep and emotional play, due to Ibsen&#x27;s portrayal of an anti-heroine. 

Ibsen was interested in the then-embryonic science of mental illness and had a poor understanding of it by present-day standards. His &quot;Ghosts&quot; is another example of this. Examples of the troubled 19th-century female might include oppressed, but &quot;normal&quot;, willful characters; women in abusive or loveless relationships; and those with some type of organic brain disease. Ibsen is content to leave such explanations unsettled. Bernard Paris interprets Gabler&#x27;s actions as stemming from her &quot;need for freedom [which is] as compensatory as her craving for power... her desire to shape a man&#x27;s destiny.&quot;

==Productions==
The play was performed in Munich at the Königliches Residenz-Theater on 31 January 1891, with Clara Heese as Hedda, though Ibsen was said to be displeased with the declamatory style of her performance. Ibsen&#x27;s work had an international following so that translations and productions in various countries appeared very soon after the publication in Copenhagen and the premiere in Munich. In February 1891 there were productions in Berlin and Copenhagen. On 20 April 1891, the first British performance of the play occurred, at the Vaudeville Theatre, London, starring Elizabeth Robins, who directed it with Marion Lea, who played Thea. Robins also played Hedda in the first US production, which opened on 30 March 1898 at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, New York City. In February 1899 it was produced as part of The Moscow Art Theatre&#x27;s first season with Maria F. Andreeva as Hedda.

A 1902 production starring Minnie Maddern Fiske was a major sensation on Broadway, and following its initial limited run was revived with the same actress the next year. 

Many prominent actresses have played the role of Hedda: Vera Komissarzhevskaya, Eleonora Duse, Alla Nazimova, Asta Nielsen, Johanne Louise Schmidt, Mrs. Patrick Campbell, Eva Le Gallienne, Elizabeth Robins, Anne Meacham, Ingrid Bergman, Peggy Ashcroft, Fenella Fielding, Jill Bennett, Janet Suzman, Diana Rigg, Isabelle Huppert, Claire Bloom, June Brown, Kate Burton, Geraldine James, Kate Mulgrew, Kelly McGillis, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Jane Fonda, Annette Bening, Amanda Donohoe, Judy Davis, Emmanuelle Seigner, Mary-Louise Parker, Harriet Walter, Rosamund Pike and Cate Blanchett. 

In 1970 the Royal National Theatre in London staged a production of the play directed by Ingmar Bergman, starring Maggie Smith, who gained much critical acclaim and won a Best Actress Evening Standard Theatre Award for her performance. Also in the early 1970s, Irene Worth played Hedda at Stratford, Ontario, prompting &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Walter Kerr to write, &quot;Miss Worth is just possibly the best actress in the world.&quot; 

On 26 February 1972, &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; was played at the Theatre in the Round, New Vic, Hartshill, Stoke on Trent. 

A 1973/4 Royal Shakespeare Company world tour of the play was directed and translated by Trevor Nunn, and starred Pam St Clement as Bertha, Patrick Stewart as Eilert Lovborg, Peter Eyre as George Tesman, Glenda Jackson as Hedda Tesman, Timothy West as Judge Brack, Constance Chapman as Juliana Tesman, and Jennie Linden as Mrs. Elvsted.

In 1975, a film version directed by Nunn and starring Jackson was released as &quot;Hedda&quot;, for which Jackson was nominated for an Oscar.

British playwright John Osborne prepared an adaptation in 1972, and in 1991 the Canadian playwright Judith Thompson presented her version at the Shaw Festival. Thompson adapted the play a second time in 2005 at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre in Toronto, setting the first half of the play in the nineteenth century, and the second half during the present day. Early in 2006, the play gained critical success at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds and the Liverpool Playhouse, directed by Matthew Lloyd with Gillian Kearney in the lead role. A revival opened in January 2009 on Broadway, starring Mary-Louise Parker as the title character and Michael Cerveris as Jørgen Tesman, at the American Airlines Theatre, to mixed critical reviews.

In 2005, a production by Richard Eyre, starring Eve Best, at the Almeida Theatre in London was well-received and later transferred for an 11½ week run at the Duke of York&#x27;s on St Martin&#x27;s Lane. The play was staged at Chicago&#x27;s Steppenwolf Theater starring actress Martha Plimpton.

In April 2009, a modernized New Zealand adaptation by The Wild Duck starring Clare Kerrison in the title role, opened at BATS Theatre in Wellington. It was lauded as &quot;extraordinarily accessible without compromising Ibsen&#x27;s genius at all.&quot;

In 2010, Hedda Gabler was performed at the Theatre Royal in Bath, directed by Adrian Noble. The production starred Rosamund Pike as Hedda, earning praise for her compelling and multifaceted performance, which highlighted both the vulnerability and manipulative strength of Ibsen&#x27;s iconic character.

In 2011, the performance of a production of the play as translated and directed by Vahid Rahbani was stopped in Tehran, Iran. Vahid Rahbani was summoned to court for inquiry after an Iranian news agency blasted the classic drama in a review and described it as &quot;vulgar&quot; and &quot;hedonistic&quot; with symbols of &quot;sexual slavery cult.&quot; 

In February 2011, a Serbian production premiered at the National Theatre in Belgrade.

A 2012 Brian Friel adaptation of the play staged at London&#x27;s The Old Vic theatre received mixed reviews, especially for Sheridan Smith in the lead role.

In 2012, Hedda Gabler was staged at the Royal and Derngate Theatre in Northampton, directed by Jonathan Munby. The production featured Emma Hamilton in the title role, with her performance receiving attention for its emotional depth and complexity, capturing the struggle of Ibsen&#x27;s protagonist.

In 2015, Hedda Gabler was staged at the Taras Shevchenko Dnipro National Academic Ukrainian Music and Drama Theatre in Ukraine. The production was directed by Diana Stein, with Nataliya Tafi in the title role.

The play was staged in 2015 at Madrid&#x27;s María Guerrero. The production, which received mixed reviews, was directed by Eduardo Vasco and presented a text that was adapted by the Spanish playwright Yolanda Pallín with Cayetana Guillén Cuervo playing the lead role.

Tony Award-winning director Ivo van Hove made his National Theatre debut in London with a period-less production of Ibsen&#x27;s masterpiece. This new version by Patrick Marber featured Ruth Wilson in the title role and Rafe Spall as Brack.

In 2017, a ballet interpretation of the play premiered at the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet under the direction of Marit Moum Aune.

In January 2019, Richmond Shakespeare Society staged the third production of Hedda Gabler in the Society&#x27;s history. Hedda was portrayed by Amanda Adams and Judge Brack by Nigel Cole.

Since May 2019, the play has been staged in the National Theatre, Warsaw, with Hedda portrayed by .

A prostitute in the feature film &quot;Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story&quot; is named Hedda Gobbler.

The 2009 album &quot;Until the Earth Begins to Part&quot; by Scottish folk indie-rock band Broken Records features a song, &quot;If Eilert Løvborg Wrote A Song, It Would Sound Like This&quot;.

John Cale, Welsh musician and founder of American rock band The Velvet Underground, recorded a song &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; in 1976, included originally on the 1977 EP &quot;Animal Justice&quot; (now a bonus track on the CD of the album &quot;Sabotage&quot;). He performed the song live in 1998, with Siouxsie Sioux, and also in London (5 March 2010) with a band and a 19 piece orchestra in his Paris 1919 tour. The song was covered by the British neofolk band Sol Invictus for the 1995 compilation &quot;Im Blutfeuer&quot; (Cthulhu Records) and later included as a bonus track on the 2011 reissue of the Sol Invictus album &quot;In the Rain&quot;.

The Norwegian hard-rock band Black Debbath recorded the song &quot;Motörhedda Gabler&quot; on their Ibsen-inspired album &quot;Naar Vi Døde Rocker&quot; (&quot;When We Dead Rock&quot;). As the title suggests, the song is also influenced by the British heavy metal band Motörhead.

The original play &quot;Heddatron&quot; by Elizabeth Meriwether (b. 1981) melds &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; with a modern family&#x27;s search for love despite the invasion of technology into everyday life.

In the 2013 novel &quot;Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy&quot; by Helen Fielding, Bridget tries and fails to write a modernized version of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, which she mistakenly calls &quot;Hedda Gabbler&quot; and believes to have been written by Anton Chekhov. Bridget intends to call her version &quot;The Leaves In His Hair&quot; and set it in Queen&#x27;s Park, London. Bridget claims to have studied the original play as an undergraduate at Bangor University.

In the 2025 film &quot;Babygirl&quot;, the husband of the protagonist is staging a production of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, and his comment to his wife that the play is &quot;not about desire, it&#x27;s about suicide&quot; suggests that he has also misunderstood his wife&#x27;s secret desires.

<doc id="186913" wikidata="Q3810345" url="?curid=186913" title="Open All Hours">
<text>Open All Hours is a British television sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke for the BBC. It ran for 26 episodes in four series, which aired in 1976, 1981, 1982 and 1985. The programme was developed from a television pilot broadcast in Ronnie Barker&#x27;s &quot;Seven of One&quot; (1973) comedy anthology series. &quot;Open All Hours&quot; ranked eighth in the 2004 Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom poll. A sequel, titled &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;, aired from 2013 to 2019.

==Premise ==
The show&#x27;s setting is a small grocer&#x27;s shop in Balby, a suburb of Doncaster in South Yorkshire. The owner, Albert Arkwright (Ronnie Barker), is a middle-aged miser with a stammer and a knack for selling. His nephew Granville (David Jason) is his beleaguered put-upon errand boy who blames his work schedule for his lacklustre social life.

Across the road lives nurse Gladys Emmanuel (Lynda Baron), largely occupied by her professional rounds, and her elderly mother. Arkwright longs to marry Gladys, but she resists his persistent pressures. In later episodes it is explained that the two have been engaged for many years but have been unable to wed because of the advanced age of her mother, for whom she cares at home, as well as the mutual loathing between her mother and Arkwright. Though short-tempered with her fiancé, she is concerned for his and Granville&#x27;s welfare. In order to avoid Gladys&#x27;s mother, Arkwright frequently attempts to &#x27;visit&#x27; Gladys via a ladder to an upstairs window, which often ends in catastrophe.

Every episode ended with Arkwright delivering a monologue to himself reflecting on the day&#x27;s events as he closed the shop for the evening.

==Episodes==

Twenty-six episodes of &quot;Open All Hours&quot;, all written by Roy Clarke, were produced for the BBC. The show began airing in 1976 and ended in 1985 after the fourth series. All episodes have a running time of 30 minutes.

===&quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;===

A sequel, entitled &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;, was created in 2013 by original writer Roy Clarke and featuring several original cast members, including David Jason, Lynda Baron, Stephanie Cole and Maggie Ollerenshaw. On 30 January 2014, the BBC commissioned &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot; for six new episodes beginning on 26 December 2014 and ran for six series until 2019.

&quot;Open All Hours&quot; and &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;, has run for a total of 67 episodes across ten series.

==Characters==
===Arkwright===

Albert Arkwright is a pragmatic, miserly man with old-fashioned values, whose world seems to stop at his shop door, except for his uncontrollable lust for Nurse Gladys Emmanuel, which may prompt him on occasion to wander across the road, usually with a ladder, to gain access to her bedroom window. Arkwright is a devious and mildly dishonest character, who has many crafty tricks to try to persuade a customer to leave his shop having bought at least one thing, and will avoid spending his own money at all costs. He is also very protective of his savings, keeping some in his pocket wrapped in a fine gold chain, and some in an old, battered Oxo tin that he hides under the kitchen sink. This includes, or so he claims, coins from before 1922, when they were &quot;solid silver&quot;.

===Granville===

Granville is the son of Arkwright&#x27;s sister. She died a single mother when Granville was very young, leaving Arkwright to bring up the boy. Arkwright&#x27;s jokes imply that his sister was promiscuous; he frequently speculates that Granville&#x27;s father is Hungarian, and was forbidden to marry Granville&#x27;s mother because she was English. He is often referred to as a &quot;youth&quot; or &quot;young lad&quot;, even though Granville is well into his adult years. (In the Pilot episode he states that he is 25 years old.)

Granville is shy and awkward, but kind. His priorities differ from those of his uncle. He always feels that life is passing him by. Occasionally, people from Granville&#x27;s past come into the shop. To Granville, who is ever saddled with his shop duties and bearing his uncle&#x27;s belittling, their lives seem richer and more fulfilling.

When Granville has a fling with the milkwoman (played by Barbara Flynn), his uncle is unsupportive.

===Main===
==Production==
===Series development===
The shop is based on a little store called L E Riddiford in Thornbury, Gloucestershire. Roy Clarke visited this small town whilst travelling and was said to have fallen in love with the shop layout and its owner, Len Riddiford.

Ronnie Barker proposed that Arkwright should have a stammer, and this was written into the character. Barker also co-created the premise of the dangerous till. In the series, the shop&#x27;s antiquated till has a drawer that tends to snap shut suddenly. Even though this terrifies Granville and Arkwright, Arkwright refuses to replace the till due to the cost of a replacement, and because he believes it discourages burglars. In the documentary &quot;Open All Hours: A Celebration&quot;, Sydney Lotterby revealed that the till was controlled with a string by an assistant floor manager in the adjacent room, and that he once accidentally caught Barker&#x27;s fingers while filming. By the time of &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;, it is suggested that the till is now haunted by Arkwright&#x27;s ghost as it sporadically opens and closes violently at the mere suggestion of Granville spending money.

===Filming locations===

The exterior shots were shot on Lister Avenue in Balby, a suburb of Doncaster; South Yorkshire. The shop itself is a hairdresser&#x27;s salon, which closed for a summer break during each year the series was being filmed by the BBC. The same location is used for the sequel series &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;. The pilot episode (featured in the series &quot;Seven of One&quot;) used a shop front on the western intersection of Drayton Avenue and Manor Road in Ealing, London, for exterior filming.

In the first series, Nurse Gladys lives at 34 Lister Avenue. This is changed to 32 from the second series.

The local council considered demolishing the shop used in &quot;Open All Hours&quot;. A fan created a web site to garner support for preserving it. The shop was to be auctioned in Leeds on 24 November 2008, and was expected to fetch between £120,000 and £130,000; however, all bids fell short of the reserve price.

Three years earlier, a different sort of auction commemorated the programme. The BBC donated, to the British Stammering Association (BSA), two of the false moustaches worn by Ronnie Barker in the series. The BSA auctioned the moustaches at their London conference in September 2005, shortly before Barker&#x27;s death.

===Theme tune===

The show&#x27;s theme tune is a song called &quot;Alice, Where Art Thou?&quot;, written by Joseph Ascher. The arrangement is borrowed from a 1926 Charles Penrose song called Laughter And Lemons, the b side of the more well-known The Laughing Policeman. It was arranged for a brass band and performed by Max Harris, who also wrote the incidental music for the programme.

==Reception==
Barker noted in his autobiography &quot;It&#x27;s Hello from Him&quot; that he received a letter which began &quot;We are a family of stutterers...&quot;, that made his heart sink. However, the writer went on to praise his portrayal and added that the whole family found the character hilarious.

==Merchandise==

===Books===
Two books related to the programme have been released in the UK. One was written by Graham McCann and published by BBC Books in October 2014 and the other one, a &#x27;novelisation&#x27; based on scripts for the first series, was written by Christine Sparks and was published by BBC Books.

* &quot;Open All Hours&quot;
This was published in February 1981 which is based on the original programme. 
* &quot;Still Open All Hours: The Story of a Classic Comedy &quot;
This was published on 30 October 2014. 

===VHS releases===
A selection of 15 episodes of the series was released on five VHS cassettes by BBC Video on 2 April 1990, 12 June 1995, 4 March 1996, 2 June 1997, and 2 March 1998. Universal Playback, under licence by BBC Worldwide, released Series 1 and 2 as a three tape boxset on 19 August 2002 and Series 3 and 4 as a three tape set boxset on 2 June 2003.

===DVD releases===
All four series have been released in Regions 2 and 4, both individually and in box sets.
Region 1 has released the box set but the series have not been released individually there.
In Australia, the BBC with Roadshow released &quot;Series One: Episodes 1–3 Comedy Bites&quot; in 2010.

==Planned spin-off==

In 1984, at which time no new episodes of the series had been produced for two years, a spin-off was proposed based around Lynda Baron&#x27;s character, Nurse Gladys Emmanuel. Given the working title &quot;Call the Nurse&quot;, this spin-off series would have followed Nurse Gladys as she visited various eccentric and demanding patients. The characters of Arkwright and Granville were not written to appear, and Roy Clarke was keen to develop a new set of supporting characters rather than rely on those already built up for &quot;Open All Hours&quot;. A thirty-minute pilot was written but did not enter production as the BBC turned down the series; instead, &quot;Open All Hours&quot; returned for its fourth and what would be its final series the following year.

<text>The London and North Western Railway (LNWR, L&amp;NWR) was a British railway company between 1846 and 1922. In the late 19th century, the LNWR was the largest joint stock company in the world.

Dubbed the &quot;Premier Line&quot;, the LNWR&#x27;s main line connected four of the largest cities in England; London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, and, through cooperation with their Scottish partners, the Caledonian Railway also connected Scotland&#x27;s largest cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. Today this route is known as the West Coast Main Line. The LNWR&#x27;s network also extended into Wales and Yorkshire.

In 1923, it became a constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) railway, and, in 1948, the London Midland Region of British Railways.

==History==


The company was formed on 16 July 1846 by the (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. cciv), which authorised the amalgamation of the Grand Junction Railway, London and Birmingham Railway and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway. This move was prompted, in part, by the Great Western Railway&#x27;s plans for a railway north from Oxford to Birmingham. The company initially had a network of approximately , connecting London with Birmingham, Crewe, Chester, Liverpool and Manchester.

The headquarters were at Euston railway station. As traffic increased, it was greatly expanded with the opening in 1849 of the Great Hall, designed by Philip Charles Hardwick in classical style. It was long, wide and high and cost £150,000 (). The station stood on Drummond Street. Further expansion resulted in two additional platforms in the 1870s with four more in the 1890s, bringing the total to 15.

The LNWR described itself as the Premier Line. This was justified, as it included the pioneering Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830 and the original LNWR main line linking London, Birmingham and Lancashire had been the first big railway in Britain, opened throughout in 1838. As the largest joint stock company in the United Kingdom, it collected a greater revenue than any other railway company of its era.

With the Grand Junction Railway acquisition of the North Union Railway in 1846, the London and North Western Railway operated as far north as Preston. In 1859, the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway amalgamated with the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway and this combined enterprise was leased to the London and North Western Railway, giving it a direct route from London to Carlisle.

In 1858, they merged with the Chester and Holyhead Railway and became responsible for the lucrative Irish Mail trains via the North Wales Main Line to Holyhead.

On 1 February 1859, the company launched the &quot;limited mail&quot; service, which was only allowed to take three passenger coaches, one each for Glasgow, Edinburgh and Perth. The Postmaster General was always willing to allow a fourth coach, provided the increased weight did not cause time to be lost in running. The train was timed to leave Euston at 20.30 and operated until the institution of a dedicated post train, wholly of Post Office vehicles, in 1885. On 1 October 1873 the first sleeping carriage ran between Euston and Glasgow, attached to the &quot;limited mail&quot;. It ran three nights a week in each direction. On 1 February 1874 a second carriage was provided and the service ran every night.

In 1860, the company pioneered the use of the water trough designed by John Ramsbottom. It was introduced on a section of level track at Mochdre, between Llandudno Junction and Colwyn Bay.

The company inherited several manufacturing facilities from the companies with which it merged, but these were consolidated and in 1862, locomotive construction and maintenance was done at the Crewe Locomotive Works, carriage building was done at Wolverton and wagon building was concentrated at Earlestown.

At the core of the LNWR system was the main line network connecting London Euston with the major cities of Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, and (through co-operation with the Caledonian Railway) Edinburgh and Glasgow. This route is today known as the West Coast Main Line. A ferry service also linked Holyhead to Greenore in County Louth, where the LNWR owned the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway, which connected to other lines of the Irish mainline network at Dundalk and Newry.

The LNWR also had the Huddersfield Line connecting Liverpool and Manchester with Leeds, and secondary routes extending to Nottingham, Derby, Peterborough and South Wales.

At its peak just before World War I, it ran a route mileage of more than , and employed 111,000 people. In 1913, the company achieved a total revenue of £17,219,060 () with working expenses of £11,322,164 ().

On 1 January 1922, one year before it amalgamated with other railways to create the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), the LNWR amalgamated with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (including its subsidiary the Dearne Valley Railway) and at the same time absorbed the North London Railway and the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, both of which were previously controlled by the LNWR. With this, the LNWR achieved a route mileage (including joint lines, and lines leased or worked) of .

The company built a war memorial in the form of an obelisk outside Euston station to commemorate the 3,719 of its employees who died in the First World War. After the Second World War, the names of the LMS&#x27;s casualties were added to the LNWR&#x27;s memorial.

The LNWR were also involved in the mass manufacture of replacement legs in the mid 19th century and the early 20th century. This is due-to the routine demand for prostheses for disabled staff. Serious injuries that resulted in the loss of limbs were common at this time with over 4,963 casualties in the year of 1910 on the LNWR alone, and over 25,000 injuries across the whole industry, manufacturing prostheses resulted in self-sufficiency for the company.

==Electrification==

From 1909 to 1922, the LNWR undertook a large-scale project to electrify the whole of its London inner-suburban network.
The London and North Western Railway London inner-suburban network, encompassed the lines from London Broad Street to Richmond, London Euston to Watford, with branch lines such as Watford to Croxley Green. There were also links to the District Railway at Earl&#x27;s Court and over the route to Richmond. With the Bakerloo Tube Line being extended over the Watford DC lines, the railway was electrified at 630 V DC fourth rail. The electricity was generated at the LNWR&#x27;s power station in Stonebridge Park and a depot built at Croxley Green.

==Successors==
The LNWR became a constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) railway when the railways of Great Britain were merged in the grouping of 1923. Ex-LNWR lines formed the core of the LMS&#x27;s Western Division.

Nationalisation followed in 1948, with the English and Welsh lines of the LMS becoming the London Midland Region of British Railways. Some former LNWR routes were subsequently closed, including the lines running east to west across the Midlands (e.g. Peterborough to Northampton and to Oxford), but others were developed as part of the Inter City network, such as the main lines from London to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Carlisle, collectively known in the modern era as the West Coast Main Line. These were electrified in the 1960s and 1970s, and further upgraded in the 1990s and 2000s, with trains now running at up to 125 mph. Other LNWR lines survive as part of commuter networks around major cities such as Birmingham and Manchester. In 2017 it was announced that the new franchisee for the West Midlands and semi-fast West Coast services between London and North West England would utilise the brand London Northwestern Railway as an homage to the LNWR.

== Acquisitions ==


==Locomotives==
The LNWR&#x27;s main engineering works were at Crewe (locomotives), Wolverton (carriages) and Earlestown (wagons). Locomotives were usually painted green at first, but in 1873 black was adopted as the standard livery. This finish has been described as &quot;blackberry black&quot;.

==Accidents and incidents==
Major accidents on the LNWR include:
*On 26 March 1850, the boiler of a locomotive exploded at Wolverton, Buckinghamshire due to tampering of the safety valves. One person was injured.
*On 30 April 1851 a train returning from Chester Races broke down in Sutton tunnel, and the following train ran into it. Six passengers were killed.
*On 6 September 1851 a train run for the Great Exhibition returning from Euston to Oxford derailed at Bicester and six passengers were killed.
*On 6 March 1853, the boiler of a locomotive exploded at Longsight, Lancashire. Six people were killed and the engine shed was severely damaged.
*On 27 August 1860 a passenger train collided with a goods train at Craven Arms and one passenger was killed.

*On 15 August 1903, two passenger trains collided at , Lancashire due to faulty points.
*On 15 October 1907, a mail train was derailed at , Shropshire due to excessive speed on a curve. Eighteen people were killed.
*On 19 August 1909, a passenger train was derailed at Friezland, West Yorkshire. Two people were killed.
*On 5 December 1910, a passenger train was in a rear-end collision at , London. Three people were killed and more than 40 were injured.
*On 17 September 1912, the driver of an express train misread signals at Ditton Junction, Cheshire. The train was derailed when it ran over points at an excessive speed. Fifteen people were killed.
*On 14 August 1915, an express passenger train was derailed at Weedon, Northamptonshire due to a locomotive defect. Ten people were killed and 21 were injured.

==Ships==
The LNWR operated ships on Irish Sea crossings between Holyhead and Dublin, Howth, Kingstown or Greenore. At Greenore, the LNWR built and operated the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway to link the port with the Belfast–Dublin line operated by the Great Northern Railway.

The LNWR also operated a joint service with the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway from Fleetwood to Belfast and Derry.

<text>The Grand Junction Railway (GJR) was an early railway company in the United Kingdom, which existed between 1833 and 1846. The line built by the company, which opened in 1837, linked the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to Birmingham via Warrington, Crewe, Stafford and Wolverhampton. This was the first trunk railway to be completed in England, and arguably the world&#x27;s first long-distance railway with steam traction. It terminated at Curzon Street Station in Birmingham, which it shared with the London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR), whose adjacent platforms gave an interchange with full connectivity (with through carriages) between Liverpool, Manchester and London.

The company merged with its business partners in 1846 to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The lines which comprised the GJR now form the central section of the West Coast Main Line.

==History==

The Grand Junction Railway Company was established in the second half of 1832 by the consolidation of two rival companies: the Birmingham and Liverpool Railway Company and the Liverpool and Birmingham Railway Company. Authorised by an act of Parliament, the (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. xxxiv), on 6 May 1833 and designed by George Stephenson and Joseph Locke, the Grand Junction Railway opened for business on 4 July 1837, running for from Birmingham through Wolverhampton (via Perry Barr and Bescot), Stafford, Crewe, and Warrington, then via the existing Warrington and Newton Railway to join the Liverpool and Manchester Railway at a triangular junction at Newton Junction. The GJR established its chief engineering works at Crewe, relocating there from Edge Hill, in Liverpool.
It began operation with a temporary Birmingham terminus at Vauxhall, The travelling post office where mail was sorted on a moving train was instituted on the Grand Junction Railway in January 1838. Using a converted horse-box, it was carried out at the suggestion of Frederick Karstadt, a General Post Office surveyor. Karstadt&#x27;s son was one of two mail clerks who did the sorting.

When the London and Birmingham Railway opened on 17 September 1838, services were routed to and from Curzon Street station which it shared with the Grand Junction Railway, the platforms of which were adjacent, providing a link between Liverpool, Manchester and London. The route between Curzon Street railway station and Vauxhall primarily consisted of the Birmingham Viaduct. It consisted of 28 arches, each wide and tall and crossed the River Rea. In October 1838, the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; reported that

It is confidently expected, that after the ensuing winter is over, and the embankments on the London and Birmingham Line are well settled down, first class trains between Liverpool and Manchester and London will not occupy more than nine hours in the journey. This being accomplished, what further improvement could be desired between London and Lancashire?

In 1840, the GJR absorbed the Chester and Crewe Railway soon before it began operation. Considering itself as part of a grand railway network, the company encouraged the development of the North Union Railway which extended the tracks onward to Preston, and it also invested in the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway and the Caledonian Railway. In 1845, the GJR merged with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and consolidated its position by buying the North Union Railway in association with the Manchester and Leeds Railway.

In 1841, the company appointed Captain Mark Huish as the secretary of the railway. Huish was ruthless in the development of the business and contributed significantly to the company&#x27;s success.

==Profits==
The GJR was very profitable, paying dividends of at least 10% from its beginning and having a final capital value of more than £5.75 million (equivalent to £ million now) when it merged with the London and Birmingham Railway and Manchester and Birmingham Railway companies to become the London and North Western Railway in 1846, which in turn formed part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923.

==Locomotives==


One locomotive, &quot;Columbine&quot;, a 2-2-2 tender engine built in 1845 at Crewe Works, is preserved at the Science Museum. Designed by Alexander Allan, it was the first of the GJR&#x27;s standard &#x27;Crewe-type&#x27; engines, with outside cylinders, and carried fleet number 49. It was withdrawn from service in 1902 by the LNWR, carrying their number 1868.

<text>A Stirling engine is a heat engine that is operated by the cyclic expansion and contraction of air or other gas (the &quot;working fluid&quot;) by exposing it to different temperatures, resulting in a net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. 

More specifically, the Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine, with a permanent gaseous working fluid. &quot;Closed-cycle&quot;, in this context, means a thermodynamic system in which the working fluid is permanently contained within the system. &quot;Regenerative&quot; describes the use of a specific type of internal heat exchanger and thermal store, known as the &quot;regenerator&quot;. Strictly speaking, the inclusion of the regenerator is what differentiates a Stirling engine from other closed-cycle hot air engines.

In the Stirling engine, a working fluid (e.g. air) is heated by energy supplied from outside the engine&#x27;s interior space (cylinder). As the fluid expands, mechanical work is extracted by a piston, which is coupled to a displacer. The displacer moves the working fluid to a different location within the engine, where it is cooled, which creates a partial vacuum at the working cylinder, and more mechanical work is extracted. The displacer moves the cooled fluid back to the hot part of the engine, and the cycle continues.

A unique feature is the regenerator, which acts as a temporary heat store by retaining heat within the machine rather than dumping it into the heat sink, thereby increasing its efficiency. 

The heat is supplied from the outside, so the hot area of the engine can be warmed with any external heat source. Similarly, the cooler part of the engine can be maintained by an external heat sink, such as running water or air flow. The gas is permanently retained in the engine, allowing a gas with the most-suitable properties to be used, such as helium or hydrogen. There are no intake and no exhaust gas flows so the machine is practically silent.

The machine is reversible so that if the shaft is turned by an external power source a temperature difference will develop across the machine; in this way it acts as a heat pump.

The Stirling engine was invented by Scotsman Robert Stirling in 1816 as an industrial prime mover to rival the steam engine, and its practical use was largely confined to low-power domestic applications for over a century. 

Contemporary investment in renewable energy, especially solar energy, has given rise to its application within concentrated solar power and as a heat pump.

== History ==

=== Early hot air engines ===
Robert Stirling is considered one of the fathers of hot air engines, along with earlier innovators such as Guillaume Amontons, who built the first working hot air engine in 1699.

Amontons was later followed by Sir George Cayley. This engine type was of those in which the fire is enclosed, and fed by air pumped in beneath the grate in sufficient quantity to maintain combustion, while by far the largest portion of the air enters above the fire, to be heated and expanded; the whole, together with the products of combustion, then acts on the piston, and passes through the working cylinder; and the operation being one of simple mixture only, no heating surface of metal is required, the air to be heated being brought into immediate contact with the fire.

Stirling came up with a first air engine in 1816. The principle of the Stirling Air Engine differs from that of Sir George Cayley (1807), in which the air is forced through the furnace and exhausted, whereas in Stirling&#x27;s engine the air works in a closed circuit. The inventor devoted most of his attention to that.

A engine, built in 1818 for pumping water at an Ayrshire quarry, continued to work for some time until a careless attendant allowed the heater to overheat. This experiment proved to the inventor that, owing to the low working pressure obtainable, the engine could only be adapted to low power for which there was, at that time, no demand.

The Stirling 1816 patent was also about an &quot;economiser,&quot; which is the predecessor of the regenerator. In this patent (# 4081) he describes the &quot;economiser&quot; technology and several applications where such technology can be used. Out of them came a new arrangement for a hot air engine.

With his brother James, Stirling patented a second hot air engine in 1827. They inverted the design so that the hot ends of the displacers were underneath the machinery, and they added a compressed air pump so the air within could be pressurised to around .

The Stirling brothers were followed shortly after (1828) by Parkinson &amp; Crossley and Arnott in 1829.

These precursors, including Ericsson, have brought to the world the hot air engine technology and its enormous advantages over the steam engine. Each came with his own specific technology, and although the Stirling engine and the Parkinson &amp; Crossley engines were quite similar, Robert Stirling distinguished himself by inventing the regenerator.

Parkinson and Crossley introduced the principle of using air of greater density than that of the atmosphere and so obtained an engine of greater power in the same compass. James Stirling followed this same idea when he built the famous Dundee engine.

The Stirling patent of 1827 was the base of the Stirling third patent of 1840. The changes from the 1827 patent were minor but essential, and this third patent led to the Dundee engine.

James Stirling presented his engine to the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1845, the first engine of this kind which, after various modifications, was efficiently constructed and heated, had a cylinder of in diameter, with a length of stroke of , and made 40 strokes or revolutions in a minute (40 rpm). This engine moved all the machinery at the Dundee Foundry Company&#x27;s works for eight or ten months, and was previously found capable of raising 320,000 kg (700,000 lbs) 60 cm (2 ft) in a minute, a power of approximately .
Finding this power insufficient for their works, the Dundee Foundry Company erected the second engine with a cylinder of in diameter, a stroke of , and making 28 strokes in a minute. When this engine had been in continuous operation for over two years it had not only performed the work of the foundry in the most satisfactory manner but had been tested (by a friction brake on a third mover) to the extent of lifting nearly , approximately .
=== Invention and early development ===
The Stirling engine (or Stirling&#x27;s air engine as it was known at the time) was invented and patented in 1816. It followed earlier attempts at making an air engine but was probably the first put to practical use when, in 1818, an engine built by Stirling was employed pumping water in a quarry. The main subject of Stirling&#x27;s original patent was a heat exchanger, which he called an &quot;economiser&quot; for its enhancement of fuel economy in a variety of applications. The patent also described in detail the employment of one form of the economiser in his unique closed-cycle air engine design in which application it is now generally known as a &quot;regenerator&quot;. Subsequent development by Robert Stirling and his brother James, an engineer, resulted in patents for various improved configurations of the original engine including pressurization, which by 1843, had sufficiently increased power output to drive all the machinery at a Dundee iron foundry.

A paper presented by James Stirling in June 1845 to the Institution of Civil Engineers stated that his aims were not only to save fuel but also to create a safer alternative to the steam engines of the time, whose boilers frequently exploded, causing many injuries and fatalities. This has, however, been disputed.

The need for Stirling engines to run at very high temperatures to maximize power and efficiency exposed limitations in the materials of the day, and the few engines that were built in those early years suffered unacceptably frequent failures (albeit with far less disastrous consequences than boiler explosions). For example, the Dundee foundry engine was replaced by a steam engine after three hot cylinder failures in four years.

=== Later 19th century ===
Subsequent to the replacement of the Dundee foundry engine there is no record of the Stirling brothers having any further involvement with air engine development, and the Stirling engine never again competed with steam as an industrial scale power source. (Steam boilers were becoming safer, e.g. the Hartford Steam Boiler and steam engines more efficient, thus presenting less of a target for rival prime movers). However, beginning about 1860, smaller engines of the Stirling/hot air type were produced in substantial numbers for applications in which reliable sources of low to medium power were required, such as pumping air for church organs or raising water. These smaller engines generally operated at lower temperatures so as not to tax available materials, and so were relatively inefficient. Their selling point was that unlike steam engines, they could be operated safely by anybody capable of managing a fire. The 1906 Rider-Ericsson Engine Co. catalog claimed that &quot;any gardener or ordinary domestic can operate these engines and no licensed or experienced engineer is required&quot;. Several types remained in production beyond the end of the century, but apart from a few minor mechanical improvements the design of the Stirling engine in general stagnated during this period.

=== 20th-century revival ===
During the early part of the 20th century, the role of the Stirling engine as a &quot;domestic motor&quot; was gradually taken over by electric motors and small internal combustion engines. By the late 1930s, it was largely forgotten, only produced for toys and a few small ventilating fans.

====Philips MP1002CA====
Around that time, Philips was seeking to expand sales of its radios into parts of the world where grid electricity and batteries were not consistently available. Philips&#x27; management decided that offering a low-power portable generator would facilitate such sales and asked a group of engineers at the company&#x27;s research lab in Eindhoven to evaluate alternative ways of achieving this aim. After a systematic comparison of various prime movers, the team decided to go forward with the Stirling engine, citing its quiet operation (both audibly and in terms of radio interference) and ability to run on a variety of heat sources (common lamp oil – &quot;cheap and available everywhere&quot; – was favored). They were also aware that, unlike steam and internal combustion engines, virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the Stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and know-how should enable great improvements.

By 1951, the 180/200 W generator set designated MP1002CA (known as the &quot;Bungalow set&quot;) was ready for production and an initial batch of 250 was planned, but soon it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price. Additionally, the advent of transistor radios and their much lower power requirements meant that the original reason for the set was disappearing. Approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced. Some found their way into university and college engineering departments around the world, giving generations of students a valuable introduction to the Stirling engine; a letter dated March 1961 from Research and Control Instruments Ltd. London WC1 to North Devon Technical College, offering &quot;remaining stocks... to institutions such as yourselves... at a special price of £75 net&quot;.

In parallel with the Bungalow set, Philips developed experimental Stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s, but only achieved commercial success with the &quot;reversed Stirling engine&quot; cryocooler. They filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they licensed to other companies and which formed the basis of much of the development work in the modern era.

====Submarine use====
In 1996, the Swedish navy commissioned three Gotland-class submarines. On the surface, these boats are propelled by marine diesel engines; however, when submerged they use a Stirling-driven generator developed by Swedish shipbuilder Kockums to recharge batteries and provide electrical power for propulsion. A supply of liquid oxygen is carried to support burning of diesel fuel to power the engine. Stirling engines are also fitted to Swedish Södermanland-class submarines, the Archer-class submarines in service in Singapore, and the Japanese Sōryū-class submarines, with the engines license-built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. In a submarine application, the Stirling engine offers the advantage of being exceptionally quiet when running.

===21st-century developments===

By the turn of the 21st century, Stirling engines were used in the dish version of Concentrated Solar Power systems. A mirrored dish similar to a very large satellite dish directs and concentrates sunlight onto a thermal receiver, which absorbs and collects the heat and using a fluid transfers it into the Stirling engine. The resulting mechanical power is then used to run a generator or alternator to produce electricity.

The core component of micro combined heat and power (CHP) units can be formed by a Stirling cycle engine, as they are more efficient and safer than a comparable steam engine. By 2003, CHP units were being commercially installed in domestic applications, such as home electrical generators.

In 2013, an article was published about scaling laws of free-piston Stirling engines based on six characteristic dimensionless groups.

== Name and classification ==
Robert Stirling patented the first practical example of a closed-cycle hot air engine in 1816, and it was suggested by Fleeming Jenkin as early as 1884 that all such engines should therefore generically be called Stirling engines. This naming proposal found little favour, and the various types on the market continued to be known by the name of their individual designers or manufacturers, e.g., Rider&#x27;s, Robinson&#x27;s, or Heinrici&#x27;s (hot) air engine. In the 1940s, the Philips company was seeking a suitable name for its own version of the &#x27;air engine&#x27;, which by that time had been tested with working fluids other than air, and decided upon &#x27;Stirling engine&#x27; in April 1945. However, nearly thirty years later, Graham Walker still had cause to bemoan the fact such terms as &quot;hot air engine&quot; remained interchangeable with &quot;Stirling engine&quot;, which itself was applied widely and indiscriminately, a situation that continues.

Like the steam engine, the Stirling engine is traditionally classified as an external combustion engine, as all heat transfers to and from the working fluid take place through a solid boundary (heat exchanger) thus isolating the combustion process and any contaminants it may produce from the working parts of the engine. This contrasts with an internal combustion engine, where heat input is by combustion of a fuel within the body of the working fluid. Most of the many possible implementations of the Stirling engine fall into the category of reciprocating piston engine.

== Theory ==

The idealised Stirling cycle consists of four thermodynamic processes acting on the working fluid:

# Isothermal expansion. The expansion-space and associated heat exchanger are maintained at a constant high temperature, and the gas undergoes near-isothermal expansion absorbing heat from the hot source.
# Constant-volume (known as isovolumetric or isochoric) heat-removal. The gas is passed through the regenerator, where it cools, transferring heat to the regenerator for use in the next cycle.
# Isothermal compression. The compression space and associated heat exchanger are maintained at a constant low temperature so the gas undergoes near-isothermal compression rejecting heat to the cold sink
# Constant-volume (known as isovolumetric or isochoric) heat-addition. The gas passes back through the regenerator where it recovers much of the heat transferred in process 2, heating up on its way to the expansion space.

With the ideal, maximally efficient, Stirling engine, for the thermal reservoirs the ratio of the heat in to the heat out is the efficiency of the ideal Carnot cycle. This is the Carnot efficiency, which is the ratio of the Kelvin temperatures of the cold to the hot reservoir. With the ideal, maximally efficient, Carnot cycle, the isochores (constant volume) are replaced by adiabats (no net heat transfer because no heat transfer). For the ideal Stirling cycle, whatever heat enters during the isochoric leg where the temperature increases is totally released during the isochoric leg where the temperature decreases (no net heat transfer). 

The engine is designed so the working gas is generally compressed in the colder portion of the engine and expanded in the hotter portion resulting in a net conversion of heat into work. An internal regenerative heat exchanger increases the Stirling engine&#x27;s thermal efficiency compared to simpler hot air engines lacking this feature.

The Stirling engine uses the temperature difference between its hot end and cold end to establish a cycle of a fixed mass of gas, heated and expanded, and cooled and compressed, thus converting thermal energy into mechanical energy. The greater the temperature difference between the hot and cold sources, the greater the thermal efficiency. The maximum theoretical efficiency is equivalent to that of the Carnot cycle, but the efficiency of real engines is less than this value because of friction and other losses.

Since the Stirling engine is a closed cycle, it contains a fixed mass of gas called the &quot;working fluid&quot;, most commonly air, hydrogen or helium. In normal operation, the engine is sealed and no gas enters or leaves; no valves are required, unlike other types of piston engines. The Stirling engine, like most heat engines, cycles through four main processes: cooling, compression, heating, and expansion. This is accomplished by moving the gas back and forth between hot and cold heat exchangers, often with a regenerator between the heater and cooler. The hot heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat source, such as a fuel burner, and the cold heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat sink, such as air fins. A change in gas temperature causes a corresponding change in gas pressure, while the motion of the piston makes the gas alternately expand and compress.

The gas follows the behaviour described by the gas laws that describe how a gas&#x27;s pressure, temperature, and volume are related. When the gas is heated, the pressure rises (because it is in a sealed chamber) and this pressure then acts on the power piston to produce a power stroke. When the gas is cooled the pressure drops and this drop means that the piston needs to do less work to compress the gas on the return stroke. The difference in work between the strokes yields a net positive power output.

When one side of the piston is open to the atmosphere, the operation is slightly different. As the sealed volume of working gas comes in contact with the hot side, it expands, doing work on both the piston and on the atmosphere. When the working gas contacts the cold side, its pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the atmosphere pushes on the piston and does work on the gas.

== Components ==
As a consequence of closed-cycle operation, the heat driving a Stirling engine must be transmitted from a heat source to the working fluid by heat exchangers and finally to a heat sink. A Stirling engine system has at least one heat source, one heat sink and up to five heat exchangers. Some types may combine or dispense with some of these.

=== Heat source ===
The heat source may be provided by the combustion of a fuel and, since the combustion products do not mix with the working fluid and hence do not come into contact with the internal parts of the engine, a Stirling engine can run on fuels that would damage other engine types&#x27; internals, such as landfill gas, which may contain siloxane that could deposit abrasive silicon dioxide in conventional engines.

Other suitable heat sources include concentrated solar energy, geothermal energy, nuclear energy, waste heat and bioenergy. If solar power is used as a heat source, regular solar mirrors and solar dishes may be utilised. The use of Fresnel lenses and mirrors has also been advocated, for example in planetary surface exploration. Solar powered Stirling engines are increasingly popular as they offer an environmentally sound option for producing power while some designs are economically attractive in development projects.

=== Heat exchangers ===
Designing Stirling engine heat exchangers is a balance between high heat transfer with low viscous pumping losses, and low dead space (unswept internal volume). Engines that operate at high powers and pressures require that heat exchangers on the hot side be made of alloys that retain considerable strength at high temperatures and that don&#x27;t corrode or creep.

In small, low power engines the heat exchangers may simply consist of the walls of the respective hot and cold chambers, but where larger powers are required a greater surface area is needed to transfer sufficient heat. Typical implementations are internal and external fins or multiple small bore tubes for the hot side, and a cooler using a liquid (like water) for the cool side.

=== Regenerator ===
In a Stirling engine, the regenerator is an internal heat exchanger and temporary heat store placed between the hot and cold spaces such that the working fluid passes through it first in one direction then the other, taking heat from the fluid in one direction, and returning it in the other. It can be as simple as metal mesh or foam, and benefits from high surface area, high heat capacity, low conductivity and low flow friction. Its function is to retain within the system that heat which would otherwise be exchanged with the environment at temperatures intermediate to the maximum and minimum cycle temperatures, thus enabling the thermal efficiency of the cycle (though not of any practical engine) to approach the limiting Carnot efficiency.

The primary effect of regeneration in a Stirling engine is to increase the thermal efficiency by &#x27;recycling&#x27; internal heat which would otherwise pass through the engine irreversibly. As a secondary effect, increased thermal efficiency yields a higher power output from a given set of hot and cold end heat exchangers. These usually limit the engine&#x27;s heat throughput. In practice this additional power may not be fully realized as the additional &quot;dead space&quot; (unswept volume) and pumping loss inherent in practical regenerators reduces the potential efficiency gains from regeneration.

The design challenge for a Stirling engine regenerator is to provide sufficient heat transfer capacity without introducing too much additional internal volume (&#x27;dead space&#x27;) or flow resistance. These inherent design conflicts are one of many factors that limit the efficiency of practical Stirling engines. A typical design is a stack of fine metal wire meshes, with low porosity to reduce dead space, and with the wire axes perpendicular to the gas flow to reduce conduction in that direction and to maximize convective heat transfer.

The regenerator is the key component invented by Robert Stirling, and its presence distinguishes a true Stirling engine from any other closed-cycle hot air engine. Many small &#x27;toy&#x27; Stirling engines, particularly low-temperature difference (LTD) types, do not have a distinct regenerator component and might be considered hot air engines; however, a small amount of regeneration is provided by the surface of the displacer itself and the nearby cylinder wall, or similarly the passage connecting the hot and cold cylinders of an alpha configuration engine.

=== Heat sink ===
The larger the temperature difference between the hot and cold sections of a Stirling engine, the greater the engine&#x27;s efficiency. The heat sink is typically the environment the engine operates in, at ambient temperature. In the case of medium- to high-power engines, a radiator is required to transfer the heat from the engine to the ambient air. Marine engines have the advantage of using cool ambient sea, lake, or river water, which is typically cooler than ambient air. In the case of combined heat and power systems, the engine&#x27;s cooling water is used directly or indirectly for heating purposes, raising efficiency.

Alternatively, heat may be supplied at ambient temperature and the heat sink maintained at a lower temperature by such means as cryogenic fluid (see Liquid nitrogen economy) or iced water.

=== Displacer ===
The displacer is a special-purpose piston, used in Beta and Gamma type Stirling engines, to move the working gas back and forth between the hot and cold heat exchangers. Depending on the type of engine design, the displacer may or may not be sealed to the cylinder; i.e., it may be a loose fit within the cylinder, allowing the working gas to pass around it as it moves to occupy the part of the cylinder beyond. The Alpha type engine has a high stress on the hot side, that&#x27;s why so few inventors started to use a hybrid piston for that side. The hybrid piston has a sealed part as a normal Alpha type engine, but it has a connected displacer part with smaller diameter as the cylinder around that. The compression ratio is a bit smaller than in the original Alpha type engines, but the stress factor is pretty low on the sealed parts.

== Configurations ==
The three major types of Stirling engines are distinguished by the way they move the air between the hot and cold areas:

# The &quot;alpha&quot; configuration has two power pistons, one in a hot cylinder, one in a cold cylinder, and the gas is driven between the two by the pistons; it is typically in a V-formation with the pistons joined at the same point on a crankshaft.
# The &quot;beta&quot; configuration has a single cylinder with a hot end and a cold end, containing a power piston and a &#x27;displacer&#x27; that drives the gas between the hot and cold ends. It is typically used with a rhombic drive to achieve the phase difference between the displacer and power pistons, but they can be joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.
# The &quot;gamma&quot; configuration has two cylinders: one containing a displacer, with a hot and a cold end, and one for the power piston; they are joined to form a single space, so the cylinders have equal pressure; the pistons are typically in parallel and joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.

=== Alpha ===
An alpha Stirling contains two power pistons in separate cylinders, one hot and one cold. The hot cylinder is situated inside the high-temperature heat exchanger and the cold cylinder is situated inside the low-temperature heat exchanger. This type of engine has a high power-to-volume ratio but has technical problems because of the usually high temperature of the hot piston and the durability of its seals. In practice, this piston usually carries a large insulating head to move the seals away from the hot zone at the expense of some additional dead space. The crank angle has a major effect on efficiency and the best angle frequently must be found experimentally. An angle of 90° frequently locks.

A four-step description of the process is as follows:

# Most of the working gas is in the hot cylinder and has more contact with the hot cylinder&#x27;s walls. This results in overall heating of the gas. Its pressure increases and the gas expands. Because the hot cylinder is at its maximum volume and the cold cylinder is at mid stroke (partial volume), the volume of the system is increased by expansion into the cold cylinder.
# The system is at its maximum volume and more gas has contact with the cold cylinder. This cools the gas, lowering its pressure. Because of flywheel momentum or other piston pairs on the same shaft, the hot cylinder begins an upstroke reducing the volume of the system.
# Almost all the gas is now in the cold cylinder and cooling continues. This continues to reduce the pressure of the gas and cause contraction. Because the hot cylinder is at minimum volume and the cold cylinder is at its maximum volume, the volume of the system is further reduced by compression of the cold cylinder inwards.
# The system is at its minimum volume and the gas has greater contact with the hot cylinder. The volume of the system increases by expansion of the hot cylinder.

=== Beta ===
A beta Stirling has a single power piston arranged within the same cylinder on the same shaft as a displacer piston. The displacer piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and the momentum of the machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.

# Power piston (dark grey) has compressed the gas, the displacer piston (light grey) has moved so that most of the gas is adjacent to the hot heat exchanger.
# The heated gas increases in pressure and pushes the power piston to the farthest limit of the power stroke.
# The displacer piston now moves, shunting the gas to the cold end of the cylinder.
# The cooled gas is now compressed by the flywheel momentum. This takes less energy, since its pressure drops when it is cooled.

== Other types ==
Other Stirling configurations continue to interest engineers and inventors.

* The rotary Stirling engine seeks to convert power from the Stirling cycle directly into torque, similar to the rotary combustion engine. No practical engine has yet been built but a number of concepts, models and patents have been produced, such as the Quasiturbine engine.
* A hybrid between piston and rotary configuration is a double-acting engine. This design rotates the displacers on either side of the power piston. In addition to giving great design variability in the heat transfer area, this layout eliminates all but one external seal on the output shaft and one internal seal on the piston. Also, both sides can be highly pressurized as they balance against each other.
* Another alternative is the Fluidyne engine (or Fluidyne heat pump), which uses hydraulic pistons to implement the Stirling cycle. The work produced by a Fluidyne engine goes into pumping the liquid. In its simplest form, the engine contains a working gas, a liquid, and two non-return valves.
* The Ringbom engine concept published in 1907 has no rotary mechanism or linkage for the displacer. This is instead driven by a small auxiliary piston, usually a thick displacer rod, with the movement limited by stops.
* The engineer Andy Ross invented a two-cylinder Stirling engine (positioned at 0°, not 90°) connected using a special yoke.
* The Franchot engine is a double-acting engine invented by Charles-Louis-Félix Franchot in the nineteenth century. In a double-acting engine, the pressure of the working fluid acts on both sides of the piston. One of the simplest forms of a double-acting machine, the Franchot engine consists of two pistons and two cylinders, and acts like two separate alpha machines. In the Franchot engine, each piston acts in two gas phases, which makes more efficient use of the mechanical components than a single-acting alpha machine. However, a disadvantage of this machine is that one connecting rod must have a sliding seal at the hot side of the engine, which is difficult when dealing with high pressures and temperatures.

=== Free-piston engines ===
Free-piston Stirling engines include those with liquid pistons and those with diaphragms as pistons. In a free-piston device, energy may be added or removed by an electrical linear alternator, pump or other coaxial device. This avoids the need for a linkage, and reduces the number of moving parts. In some designs, friction and wear are nearly eliminated by the use of non-contact gas bearings or very precise suspension through planar springs.

Four basic steps in the cycle of a free-piston Stirling engine are:

# The power piston is pushed outwards by the expanding gas thus doing work. Gravity plays no role in the cycle.
# The gas volume in the engine increases and therefore the pressure reduces, which causes a pressure difference across the displacer rod to force the displacer towards the hot end. When the displacer moves, the piston is almost stationary and therefore the gas volume is almost constant. This step results in the constant volume cooling process, which reduces the pressure of the gas.
# The reduced pressure now arrests the outward motion of the piston and it begins to accelerate towards the hot end again and by its own inertia, compresses the now cold gas, which is mainly in the cold space.
# As the pressure increases, a point is reached where the pressure differential across the displacer rod becomes large enough to begin to push the displacer rod (and therefore also the displacer) towards the piston and thereby collapsing the cold space and transferring the cold, compressed gas towards the hot side in an almost constant volume process. As the gas arrives in the hot side the pressure increases and begins to move the piston outwards to initiate the expansion step as explained in (1).

In the early 1960s, William T. Beale of Ohio University located in Athens, Ohio, invented a free piston version of the Stirling engine to overcome the difficulty of lubricating the crank mechanism. While the invention of the basic free piston Stirling engine is generally attributed to Beale, independent inventions of similar types of engines were made by E.H. Cooke-Yarborough and C. West at the Harwell Laboratories of the UK AERE. G.M. Benson also made important early contributions and patented many novel free-piston configurations.

The first known mention of a Stirling cycle machine using freely moving components is a British patent disclosure in 1876. This machine was envisaged as a refrigerator (i.e., the &quot;reversed&quot; Stirling cycle). The first consumer product to utilize a free piston Stirling device was a portable refrigerator manufactured by Twinbird Corporation of Japan and offered in the US by Coleman in 2004.

=== Flat engines ===
Design of the flat double-acting Stirling engine solves the drive of a displacer with the help of the fact that areas of the hot and cold pistons of the displacer are different.

The drive does so without any mechanical transmission. Using diaphragms eliminates friction and need for lubricants.

When the displacer is in motion, the generator holds the working piston in the limit position, which brings the engine working cycle close to an ideal Stirling cycle. The ratio of the area of the heat exchangers to the volume of the machine increases by the implementation of a flat design.

Flat design of the working cylinder approximates thermal process of the expansion and compression closer to the isothermal one.

The disadvantage is a large area of the thermal insulation between the hot and cold space.

=== Thermoacoustic cycle ===
Thermoacoustic devices are very different from Stirling devices, although the individual path travelled by each working gas molecule does follow a real Stirling cycle. These devices include the thermoacoustic engine and thermoacoustic refrigerator. High-amplitude acoustic standing waves cause compression and expansion analogous to a Stirling power piston, while out-of-phase acoustic travelling waves cause displacement along a temperature gradient, analogous to a Stirling displacer piston. Thus a thermoacoustic device typically does not have a displacer, as found in a beta or gamma Stirling.

=== Other developments ===
NASA has considered nuclear-decay heated Stirling Engines for extended missions to the outer solar system. In 2018, NASA and the United States Department of Energy announced that they had successfully tested a new type of nuclear reactor called KRUSTY, which stands for &quot;Kilopower Reactor Using Stirling TechnologY&quot;, and which is designed to be able to power deep space vehicles and probes as well as exoplanetary encampments.

At the 2012 Cable-Tec Expo put on by the Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers, Dean Kamen took the stage with Time Warner Cable Chief Technology Officer Mike LaJoie to announce a new initiative between his company Deka Research and the SCTE. Kamen refers to it as a Stirling engine.

== Operational considerations ==
=== Size and temperature ===
Very low-power engines have been built that run on a temperature difference of as little as 0.5 K. A &quot;displacer-type Stirling engine&quot; has one piston and one displacer. A temperature difference is required between the top and bottom of the large cylinder to run the engine. In the case of the &quot;low-temperature-difference&quot; (LTD) Stirling engine, the temperature difference between one&#x27;s hand and the surrounding air can be enough to run the engine. The power piston in the displacer-type Stirling engine is tightly sealed and is controlled to move up and down as the gas inside expands. The displacer, on the other hand, is very loosely fitted so that air can move freely between the hot and cold sections of the engine as the piston moves up and down. The displacer moves up and down to cause most of the gas in the displacer cylinder to be either heated, or cooled.

Stirling engines, especially those that run on small temperature differentials, are quite large for the amount of power that they produce (i.e., they have low specific power). This is primarily due to the heat transfer coefficient of gaseous convection, which limits the heat flux that can be attained in a typical cold heat exchanger to about 500 W/(m2·K), and in a hot heat exchanger to about 500–5000 W/(m2·K). Compared with internal combustion engines, this makes it more challenging for the engine designer to transfer heat into and out of the working gas. Because of the thermal efficiency the required heat transfer grows with lower temperature difference, and the heat exchanger surface (and cost) for 1 kW output grows with (1/ΔT)2. Therefore, the specific cost of very low temperature difference engines is very high. Increasing the temperature differential and/or pressure allows Stirling engines to produce more power, assuming the heat exchangers are designed for the increased heat load, and can deliver the convected heat flux necessary.

A Stirling engine cannot start instantly; it literally needs to &quot;warm up&quot;. This is true of all external combustion engines, but the warm up time may be longer for Stirlings than for others of this type such as steam engines. Stirling engines are best used as constant speed engines.

Power output of a Stirling tends to be constant and to adjust it can sometimes require careful design and additional mechanisms. Typically, changes in output are achieved by varying the displacement of the engine (often through use of a swashplate crankshaft arrangement), or by changing the quantity of working fluid, or by altering the piston/displacer phase angle, or in some cases simply by altering the engine load. This property is less of a drawback in hybrid electric propulsion or &quot;base load&quot; utility generation where constant power output is actually desirable.

=== Gas choice ===
The gas used should have a low heat capacity, so that a given amount of transferred heat leads to a large increase in pressure. Considering this issue, helium would be the best gas because of its very low heat capacity. Air is a viable working fluid, but the oxygen in a highly pressurized air engine can cause fatal accidents caused by lubricating oil explosions. Following one such accident Philips pioneered the use of other gases to avoid such risk of explosions.
* Hydrogen&#x27;s low viscosity and high thermal conductivity make it the most powerful working gas, primarily because the engine can run faster than with other gases. However, because of hydrogen absorption, and given the high diffusion rate associated with this low molecular weight gas, particularly at high temperatures, H2 leaks through the solid metal of the heater. Diffusion through carbon steel is too high to be practical, but may be acceptably low for metals such as aluminum, or even stainless steel. Certain ceramics also greatly reduce diffusion. Hermetic pressure vessel seals are necessary to maintain pressure inside the engine without replacement of lost gas. For high-temperature-differential (HTD) engines, auxiliary systems may be required to maintain high-pressure working fluid. These systems can be a gas storage bottle or a gas generator. Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of water, the action of steam on red hot carbon-based fuel, by gasification of hydrocarbon fuel, or by the reaction of acid on metal. Hydrogen can also cause the embrittlement of metals. Hydrogen is a flammable gas, which is a safety concern if released from the engine.
* Most technically advanced Stirling engines, like those developed for United States government labs, use helium as the working gas, because it functions close to the efficiency and power density of hydrogen with fewer of the material containment issues. Helium is inert, and hence not flammable. Helium is relatively expensive, and must be supplied as bottled gas. One test showed hydrogen to be 5% (absolute) more efficient than helium (24% relatively) in the GPU-3 Stirling engine. The researcher Allan Organ demonstrated that a well-designed air engine is theoretically just as &quot;efficient&quot; as a helium or hydrogen engine, but helium and hydrogen engines are several times more &quot;powerful per unit volume&quot;.
* Some engines use air or nitrogen as the working fluid. These gases have much lower power density (which increases engine costs), but they are more convenient to use and they minimize the problems of gas containment and supply (which decreases costs). The use of compressed air in contact with flammable materials or substances such as lubricating oil introduces an explosion hazard, because compressed air contains a high partial pressure of oxygen. However, oxygen can be removed from air through an oxidation reaction or bottled nitrogen can be used, which is nearly inert and very safe.
* Other possible lighter-than-air gases include methane and ammonia.

=== Pressurization ===
In most high-power Stirling engines, both the minimum pressure and mean pressure of the working fluid are above atmospheric pressure. This initial engine pressurization can be realized by a pump, or by filling the engine from a compressed gas tank, or even just by sealing the engine when the mean temperature is lower than the mean operating temperature. All of these methods increase the mass of working fluid in the thermodynamic cycle. All of the heat exchangers must be sized appropriately to supply the necessary heat transfer rates. If the heat exchangers are well designed and can supply the heat flux needed for convective heat transfer, then the engine, in a first approximation, produces power in proportion to the mean pressure, as predicted by the West number and Beale number. In practice, the maximum pressure is also limited to the safe pressure of the pressure vessel. Like most aspects of Stirling engine design, optimization is multivariate, and often has conflicting requirements. A difficulty of pressurization is that while it improves the power, the heat required increases proportionately to the increased power. This heat transfer is made increasingly difficult with pressurization since increased pressure also demands increased thicknesses of the walls of the engine, which, in turn, increase the resistance to heat transfer.

=== Lubricants and friction ===
At high temperatures and pressures, the oxygen in air-pressurized crankcases, or in the working gas of hot air engines, can combine with the engine&#x27;s lubricating oil and explode. At least one person has died in such an explosion. Lubricants can also clog heat exchangers, especially the regenerator. For these reasons, designers prefer non-lubricated, low-coefficient of friction materials (such as rulon or graphite), with low normal forces on the moving parts, especially for sliding seals. Some designs avoid sliding surfaces altogether by using diaphragms for sealed pistons. These are some of the factors that allow Stirling engines to have lower maintenance requirements and longer life than internal-combustion engines.

== Efficiency ==
Theoretical thermal efficiency equals that of the ideal Carnot cycle, i.e. the highest efficiency attainable by any heat engine. However, though it is useful for illustrating general principles, practical Stirling engines deviate substantially from the ideal. It has been argued that its indiscriminate use in many standard books on engineering thermodynamics has done a disservice to the study of Stirling engines in general.

Stirling engines cannot achieve total efficiencies typical of an internal combustion engine, the main constraint being thermal efficiency. During internal combustion, temperatures achieve around 1500 °C–1600 °C for a short period of time, resulting in greater mean heat supply temperature of the thermodynamic cycle than any Stirling engine could achieve. It is not possible to supply heat at temperatures that high by conduction, as it is done in Stirling engines because no material could conduct heat from combustion in that high temperature without huge heat losses and problems related to heat deformation of materials.

Stirling engines are capable of quiet operation and can use almost any heat source. The heat energy source is generated external to the Stirling engine rather than by internal combustion as with the Otto cycle or Diesel cycle engines. This type of engine is currently generating interest as the core component of micro combined heat and power (CHP) units, in which it is more efficient and safer than a comparable steam engine. However, it has a low power-to-weight ratio, rendering it more suitable for use in static installations where space and weight are not at a premium.

Other real-world issues reduce the efficiency of actual engines, due to the limits of convective heat transfer and viscous flow (friction). There are also practical, mechanical considerations: for instance, a simple kinematic linkage may be favoured over a more complex mechanism needed to replicate the idealized cycle, and limitations imposed by available materials such as non-ideal properties of the working gas, thermal conductivity, tensile strength, creep, rupture strength, and melting point. A question that often arises is whether the ideal cycle with isothermal expansion and compression is in fact the correct ideal cycle to apply to the Stirling engine. Professor C. J. Rallis has pointed out that it is very difficult to imagine any condition where the expansion and compression spaces may approach isothermal behavior and it is far more realistic to imagine these spaces as adiabatic. An ideal analysis where the expansion and compression spaces are taken to be adiabatic with isothermal heat exchangers and perfect regeneration was analyzed by Rallis and presented as a better ideal yardstick for Stirling machinery. He called this cycle the &#x27;pseudo-Stirling cycle&#x27; or &#x27;ideal adiabatic Stirling cycle&#x27;. An important consequence of this ideal cycle is that it does not predict Carnot efficiency. A further conclusion of this ideal cycle is that maximum efficiencies are found at lower compression ratios, a characteristic observed in real machines. In an independent work, T. Finkelstein also assumed adiabatic expansion and compression spaces in his analysis of Stirling machinery.

The ideal Stirling cycle is unattainable in the real world, as with any heat engine. The efficiency of Stirling machines is also linked to the environmental temperature: higher efficiency is obtained when the weather is cooler, thus making this type of engine less attractive in places with warmer climates. As with other external combustion engines, Stirling engines can use heat sources other than the combustion of fuels. For example, various designs for solar-powered Stirling engines have been developed.

== Comparison with internal combustion engines ==
In contrast to internal combustion engines, Stirling engines have the potential to use renewable heat sources more easily, and to be quieter and more reliable with lower maintenance. They are preferred for applications that value these unique advantages, particularly if the cost per unit energy generated is more important than the capital cost per unit power. On this basis, Stirling engines are cost-competitive up to about 100 kW.

Compared to an internal combustion engine of the same power rating, Stirling engines currently have a higher capital cost and are usually larger and heavier. However, they are more efficient than most internal combustion engines. Their lower maintenance requirements make the overall &quot;energy&quot; cost comparable. The thermal efficiency is also comparable (for small engines), ranging from 15% to 30%. For applications such as micro-CHP, a Stirling engine is often preferable to an internal combustion engine. Other applications include water pumping, astronautics, and electrical generation from plentiful energy sources that are incompatible with the internal combustion engine, such as solar energy, and biomass such as agricultural waste and other waste such as domestic refuse. However, Stirling engines are generally not price-competitive as an automobile engine, because of high cost per unit power, &amp; low power density.

Basic analysis is based on the closed-form Schmidt analysis.

Advantages of Stirling engines compared to internal combustion engines include:

* Stirling engines can run directly on any available heat source, not just one produced by combustion, so they can run on heat from solar, geothermal, biological, nuclear sources or waste heat from industrial processes.
* If combustion is used to supply heat, it can be a continuous process, so those emissions associated with the intermittent combustion processes of a reciprocating internal combustion engine can be reduced.
* Bearings and seals can be on the cool side of the engine, where they require less lubricant and last longer than equivalents on other reciprocating engine types.
* The engine mechanisms are in some ways simpler than other reciprocating engine types. No valves are needed, and the burner system (if any) can be relatively simple. Crude Stirling engines can be made using common household materials.
* A Stirling engine uses a single-phase working fluid that maintains an internal pressure close to the design pressure, and thus for a properly designed system the risk of explosion is low. In comparison, a steam engine uses a two-phase gas/liquid working fluid, so a faulty overpressure relief valve can cause an explosion.
* Low operating pressure can be used, allowing the use of lightweight cylinders.
* They can be built to run quietly and without an air supply, for air-independent propulsion use in submarines.
* They start easily (albeit slowly, after warmup) and run more efficiently in cold weather, in contrast to the internal combustion, which starts quickly in warm weather, but not in cold weather.
* A Stirling engine used for pumping water can be configured so that the water cools the compression space. This increases efficiency when pumping cold water.
* They are extremely flexible. They can be used as CHP (combined heat and power) in the winter and as coolers in summer.
* Waste heat is easily harvested (compared to waste heat from an internal combustion engine), making Stirling engines useful for dual-output heat and power systems.
* In 1986 NASA built a Stirling automotive engine and installed it in a Chevrolet Celebrity. Fuel economy was improved 45% and emissions were greatly reduced. Acceleration (power response) was equivalent to the standard internal combustion engine. This engine, designated the Mod II, also nullifies arguments that Stirling engines are heavy, expensive, unreliable, and demonstrate poor performance. A catalytic converter, muffler and frequent oil changes are not required.

Disadvantages of Stirling engines compared to internal combustion engines include:

* Stirling engine designs require heat exchangers for heat input and for heat output, and these must contain the pressure of the working fluid, where the pressure is proportional to the engine power output. In addition, the expansion-side heat exchanger is often at very high temperature, so the materials must resist the corrosive effects of the heat source, and have low creep. Typically these material requirements substantially increase the cost of the engine. The materials and assembly costs for a high-temperature heat exchanger typically accounts for 40% of the total engine cost.
* All thermodynamic cycles require large temperature differentials for efficient operation. In an external combustion engine, the heater temperature always equals or exceeds the expansion temperature. This means that the metallurgical requirements for the heater material are very demanding. This is similar to a Gas turbine, but is in contrast to an Otto engine or Diesel engine, where the expansion temperature can far exceed the metallurgical limit of the engine materials, because the input heat source is not conducted through the engine, so engine materials operate closer to the average temperature of the working gas. 
* The Stirling cycle is not actually achievable; the real cycle in Stirling machines is less efficient than the theoretical Stirling cycle. The efficiency of the Stirling cycle is lower where the ambient temperatures are mild, while it would give its best results in a cool environment, such as northern countries&#x27; winters.
* Dissipation of waste heat is especially complicated because the coolant temperature is kept as low as possible to maximize thermal efficiency. This increases the size of the radiators, which can make packaging difficult. Along with materials cost, this has been one of the factors limiting the adoption of Stirling engines as automotive prime movers. For other applications such as ship propulsion and stationary microgeneration systems using combined heat and power (CHP) high power density is not required.

== Applications ==

Applications of the Stirling engine range from heating and cooling to underwater power systems. A Stirling engine can function in reverse as a heat pump for heating or cooling. Other uses include combined heat and power, solar power generation, Stirling cryocoolers, heat pump, marine engines, low power model aircraft engines, and low temperature difference engines.

<text>Northern Epirus (, ; ; ) is a term used to refer to those parts of the historical region of Epirus, in the western Balkans, which today are part of Albania. The term is used mostly by Greeks and is associated with the existence of a substantial ethnic Greek minority in the region. It also has connotations with irredentist political claims on the territory on the grounds that it was held by Greece and in 1914 was declared an independent state by the local Greeks against annexation to the newly founded Albanian principality.

It started to be used by Greeks in 1913, upon the creation of the Albanian state following the Balkan Wars, and the incorporation into the latter of territory that was regarded by many Greeks as geographically, historically, culturally, and ethnologically connected to the Greek region of Epirus since antiquity. In the spring of 1914, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was proclaimed by ethnic Greeks in the territory and recognized by the Albanian government, though it proved short-lived as Albania collapsed with the onset of World War I. Greece held the area between 1914 and 1916 and unsuccessfully tried to annex it in March 1916. In 1917 Greek forces were driven from the area by Italy, who took over most of Albania. The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 awarded the area to Greece, however the area reverted to Albanian control in November 1921, following Greece&#x27;s defeat in the Greco-Turkish War. During the interwar period, tensions remained high due to the educational issues surrounding the Greek minority in Albania. Following Italy&#x27;s invasion of Greece from the territory of Albania in 1940 and the successful Greek counterattack, the Greek army briefly held Northern Epirus for a six-month period until the German invasion of Greece in 1941.

Tensions remained high during the Cold War, as the Greek minority was subjected to repressive measures. Although a Greek minority was recognized by the Hoxha regime, this recognition only applied to an &quot;official minority zone&quot; consisting of 99 villages, leaving out important areas of Greek settlement, such as Himara. People outside the official minority zone received no education in the Greek language, which was prohibited in public. The Hoxha regime also diluted the ethnic demographics of the region by relocating Greeks living there and settling in their stead Albanians from other parts of the country. Relations began to improve in the 1980s with Greece&#x27;s abandonment of any territorial claims over Northern Epirus and the lifting of the official state of war between the two countries. In the post Cold War era relations have continued to improve though tensions remain over the availability of education in the Greek language outside the official minority zone, property rights, and occasional violent incidents targeting members of the Greek minority.

==Name and definition==
The Greek toponym &quot;Epirus&quot; (), meaning &quot;mainland&quot; or &quot;continent&quot;, first appears in the work of Hecataeus of Miletus in the 6th century BC and is one of the few Greek names from the view of an external observer with a maritime-geographical perspective. Although not originally a native Epirote name, it later came to be adopted by the inhabitants of the area. The term &quot;Epirus&quot; is used both in the Albanian and Greek language, but in Albanian refers only to the historical and not the modern region. The term &quot;Northern Epirus&quot; rather than a clearly defined geographical term, is largely a political and diplomatic term applied to those areas partly populated by ethnic Greeks that were incorporated into the newly independent Albanian state in 1913. The term &quot;Northern Epirus&quot; was first used in official Greek correspondence in 1886, to describe the northern parts of the Janina Vilayet. According to the 20th century definition, Northern Epirus stretches from the Ceraunian Mountains north of Himara southward to the Greek border, and from the Ionian coast to Lake Prespa. Some of the cities and towns of the region are: Himarë, Sarandë, Delvinë, Gjirokastër, Korçë, and the once prosperous town of Moscopole. The region defined as Northern Epirus thus stretches further east than classical Epirus, and includes parts of the historical region Macedonia. The main rivers of the area are: Vjosë/Aoos (, Aoos) its tributary the Drino (, Drinos), the Osum ( Apsos) and the Devoll ( Eordaikos).

In antiquity, the northern border of the historical region of Epirus (and of the ancient Greek world) was the Gulf of Oricum,
 or alternatively, the mouth of the Aoös river, immediately to the north of the Bay of Aulon (modern-day Vlorë). The northern boundary of Epirus was unclear both due to political instability and the coexistence of Greek and non-Greek populations, notably Illyrians, such as in Apollonia. From the 4th century BCE onward, with a degree of certainty, the boundaries of Epirus included the Ceraunian mountains in the north, the Pindus mountains in the east, the Ionian Sea in the West, and the Ambracian Gulf in the south.

==History==
===Ottoman period===

The local Ottoman authority was mainly exercised by Muslim Albanians. There were specific parts of Epirus that enjoyed local autonomy, such as Himarë, Droviani, or Moscopole. In spite of the Ottoman presence, Christianity prevailed in many areas and became an important reason for preserving the Greek language, which was also the language of trade. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, inhabitants of the region participated in the Greek Enlightenment. One of the leading figures of that period, the Orthodox missionary Cosmas of Aetolia, traveled and preached extensively in northern Epirus, founding the Acroceraunian School in Himara in 1770. It is believed that he founded more than 200 Greek schools until his execution by Turkish authorities near Berat. In addition, the Moscopole printing house, the first in the Balkans after that of Constantinople, was founded in Moscopole. From the mid-18th century trade in the region was thriving and a great number of educational facilities and institutions were founded throughout the rural regions and the major urban centers as benefactions by several Epirot entrepreneurs. In Korçë a special community fund was established that aimed at the foundation of Greek cultural institutions.
During this period a number of uprisings against the Ottoman Empire periodically broke out. In the Orlov Revolt (1770) several units of Riziotes, Chormovites and Himariotes supported the armed operation. Some Greeks from the area took also part in the Greek War of Independence (1821–1830): many locals revolted, organized armed groups and joined the revolution. The most distinguished personalities were the engineer Konstantinos Lagoumitzis from Hormovo and Spyromilios from Himarë. The latter was one of the most active generals of the revolutionaries and participated in several major armed conflicts, such as the Third Siege of Missolonghi, where Lagoumitzis was the defenders&#x27; chief engineer. Spyromilios also became a prominent political figure after the creation of the modern Greek state and discreetly supported the revolt of his compatriots in Ottoman-occupied Epirus in 1854. Another uprising in 1878, in the Saranda-Delvina region, with the revolutionaries demanding union with Greece, was suppressed by the Ottoman forces, while in 1881, the Treaty of Berlin awarded to Greece the southernmost parts of Epirus.

According to the Ottoman &quot;Millet&quot; system, religion was a major marker of ethnicity, and thus all Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Aromanians, Orthodox Albanians, Slavs etc.) were classified as &quot;Greeks&quot;, while all Muslims (including Muslim Albanians, Greeks, Slavs etc.) were considered &quot;Turks&quot;. The dominant view in Greece considers Orthodox Christianity an integral element of the Hellenic heritage, as part of its Byzantine past. Thus, official Greek government policy from c. 1850 to c. 1950, adopted the view that speech was not a decisive factor for the establishment of a Greek national identity.

===Balkan Wars (1912–13)===

With the outbreak of the First Balkan War (1912–13) and the Ottoman defeat, the Greek army entered the region. The outcome of the following Peace Treaty of London and Peace Treaty of Bucharest, signed at the end of the Second Balkan War, was unpopular among both Greeks and Albanians, as settlements of the two people existed on both sides of the border: the southern part of Epirus was ceded to Greece, while Northern Epirus, already under the control of the Greek army, was awarded to the newly found Albanian State. However, due to the late emergence and fluidity of Albanian national identity and an absence of religious Albanian institutions, loyalty in Northern Epirus especially amongst the Orthodox to potential Albanian rule headed by (Albanian) Muslim leaders was not guaranteed.

===Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus (1914)===


In accordance with the wishes of the local Greek population, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, centered in Gjirokastër on account of the latter&#x27;s large Greek population, was declared in March 1914 by the pro-Greek party, which was in power in southern Albania at that time. Georgios Christakis-Zografos, a distinguished Greek politician from Lunxhëri, took the initiative and became the head of the Republic. Fighting broke out in Northern Epirus between Greek irregulars and Muslim Albanians who opposed the Northern Epirot movement. In May, autonomy was confirmed with the Protocol of Corfu, signed by Albanian and Northern Epirote representatives and approved by the Great Powers. The signing of the Protocol ensured that the region would have its own administration, recognized the rights of the local Greeks and provided self-government under nominal Albanian sovereignty.

However, the agreement was never fully implemented, because when World War I broke out in July, Albania collapsed. Although short-lived, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus left behind a substantial historical record, such as its own postage stamps.

===World War I and following peace treaties (1914–21)===
Under an October 1914 agreement among the Allies, Greek forces re-entered Northern Epirus and the Italians seized the Vlore region. Greece officially annexed Northern Epirus in March 1916, but was forced to revoke by the Great Powers. During the war the French Army occupied the area around Korçë in 1916, and established the Republic of Korçë. In 1917 Greece lost control of the rest of Northern Epirus to Italy, who by then had taken over most of Albania. The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 awarded the area to Greece after World War I, however, political developments such as the outcome of the elections of 1920 in Greece, the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22) and, crucially, Italian, Austrian and German lobbying in favor of Albania resulted in the area being ceded to Albania in November 1921.

===Interwar period (1921–39) - Zog&#x27;s regime===
The Albanian Government, with the country&#x27;s entrance to the League of Nations (October 1921), made the commitment to respect the social, educational, religious rights of every minority. Questions arose over the size of the Greek minority, with the Albanian government claiming 16,000, and the League of Nations estimating it at 35,000-40,000. In the event, only a limited area in the Districts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë and four villages in Himarë region consisting of 15,000 inhabitants was recognized as a Greek minority zone.

The following years, measures were taken to suppress the minority&#x27;s education. The Albanian state viewed Greek education as a potential threat to its territorial integrity, while most of the teaching staff was considered suspicious and in favour for the Northern Epirus movement. In October 1921, the Albanian government recognised minority rights and legalised Greek schools only in Greek speaking settlements located within the &quot;recognised minority zone&quot;. Within the rest of the country, Greek schools were either closed or forcibly converted to Albanian schools and teachers were expelled from the country. During the mid-1920s, attempts at opening Greek schools and teacher training colleges in urban areas with sizable Greek populations were met with difficulties which resulted in an absence of urban Greek schools in coming years. 
With the intervention of the League of Nations in 1935, a limited number of schools, and only of those inside the officially recognized zone, were reopened. The 360 schools of the pre-World War I period were reduced dramatically in the following years and education in Greek was finally eliminated altogether in 1935:

1926: 78, 1927: 68, 1928: 66, 1929: 60, 1930: 63, 1931: 64, 1932: 43, 1933: 10, 1934: 0

During this period, the Albanian state led efforts to establish an independent orthodox church (contrary to the Protocol of Corfu), thereby reducing the influence of Greek language in the country&#x27;s south. According to a 1923 law, priests who were not Albanian speakers, as well as not of Albanian origin, were excluded from this new autocephalous church.

===World War II (1939–45)===
In 1939, Albania became an Italian protectorate and was used to facilitate military operations against Greece the following year. The Italian attack, launched at October 28, 1940 was quickly repelled by the Greek forces. The Greek army, although facing a numerically and technologically superior army, counterattacked and in the next month managed to enter Northern Epirus. Northern Epirus thus became the site of the first clear setback for the Axis powers. However, after a six-month period of Greek administration, the invasion of Greece by Nazi Germany followed in April 1941 and Greece capitulated.

Following Greece&#x27;s surrender, Northern Epirus again became part of the Italian-occupied Albanian protectorate. Many Northern Epirotes formed resistance groups and organizations in the struggle against the occupation forces. In 1942 the Northern Epirote Liberation Organization (EAOVI, also called MAVI) was formed. Some others, c. 1,500 joined the left-wing Albanian National Liberation Army, in which they formed three separate battalion (named Thanasis Zikos, Pantelis Botsaris, Lefteris Talios). During the latter stages of the war, the Albanian communists were able to stop contact between the minority and the right-wing soldiers of EDES in southern Epirus, that wanted to unite Northern Epirus with Greece .

When the war ended and the communists gained power in Albania, a United States Senate resolution demanded the cession of the region to the Greek state, but according to the following post war international peace treaties it remained part of the Albanian state. During this time, some Greeks and Orthodox Albanians managed to flee Albania and resettle in Greece.

===Cold War period (1946–91) - Hoxha&#x27;s regime===

At the end of World War II, normal relations between Greece and Albania were not restored, and the two countries remained technically in a state of war until 1987. This was largely due to Greece&#x27;s territorial claims on Northern Epirus and the treatment of the Greek minority. Relations remained tense for most of the Cold War as a result.

Enver Hoxha was willing to build a constituency with the Greek minority since 1944, while some minority members had participated in the partisan struggle against the Axis. A policy of tokenism was adopted with a few favoured members of the Greek minority taking prominent positions in the one-party system.

After WWII, Albania restored the minority zone based on the 1921 League of Nations agreement but without the inclusion of the three Himara villages and education in Greek within the minority zone along with other competencies based on Comintern policies on cultural-linguistic minority issues. These competencies were related to territorial rights - as in the Soviet Union - and didn&#x27;t apply as individual rights outside the minority zones. Further issues about their application involved local politics which concerned the participation of specific communities in Communist units during WWII. After the regime&#x27;s end in 1990–91, the application of this system for the Greek minority has been described by sharply diverging narratives. Greeks in Albania, unlike minorities in other countries of the Balkans like Slav-Macedonians in Greece during this era, were a formally recognized minority which had the right to education in Greek as well as the right to publish and broadcast in Greek.
Nevertheless, the use of Greek outside the minority zones, for example in Himara, was forbidden, and many Greek names of people and places were changed to Albanian.

The Soviet-Yugoslav rapprochement in the early 1960s and the possibility that Greece might annex Northern Epirus were important factors in Albania&#x27;s rift with the Soviet Union and its move towards China. In 1967, all religious places of worship in the country were closed, all forms of public worship were outlawed throughout the country, and the existence of an Orthodox Christian population in Northern Epirus was officially denied. These measures were particularly harsh for the Epirote minority, since their religion was tied to their culture. As part of the atheism campaign the Greek minority was subject to much more comprehensive persecusion, with the closure and demolition of churches, burning of religious books and widespread human rights violations. Approximately 630 Orthodox churches in southern Albania were either closed or re-purposed. In 1975, &quot;foreign&quot; or religious personal and place names were prohibited, and had to change.

The regime also relocated Albanian settlers to the Greek minority regions and at the same time forced many Greeks to relocate to northern and central Albania, in what was seen by ethnic Greeks as an attempt to alter the demographic composition of Northern Epirus. In the &quot;minority zones&quot;, the regime created new villages with Albanian settlers, or else settled Albanian families in villages that had previously been entirely Greek. In the mixed villages, the minority rights of the Greek inhabitants were curtailed. The settlers were frequently military or administrative personnel and their families, and acted as enforcers of regime policies. Examples of these policies was the settling of 300 Albanian families in the Greek-inhabited town of Himara, and the creation of an entirely new settlement of Gjashta, comprised 3,000 Cham Albanians in the vicinity of Saranda. The settlers were awarded land grants, resulting in the permanent alteration of the demographic composition of these areas.

The first serious attempt to improve relations was initiated by Greece in the 1980s, during the government of Andreas Papandreou. In 1984, during a speech in Epirus, Papandreou declared that the inviolability of European borders as stipulated in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, to which Greece was a signatory, applied to the Greek-Albanian border. The most significant change occurred on 28 August 1987, when the Greek Cabinet lifted the state of war that had been declared since November 1940. At the same time, Papandreou deplored the &quot;miserable condition under which the Greeks in Albania live&quot;. As Albania became more dependent on trade relations with Greece the situation of the ethnic Greek population gradually improved, but nevertheless discriminatory practices existed at the time of the collapse of the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania (1990). During the years of the communist regime, irredentist aspirations by the pro-Greek parties of southern Albania was nonexistent, but re-emerged after the regime&#x27;s collapse in 1991.

===Post-communist period (1991–present)===
Beginning in 1990, large number of Albanian citizens, including members of the Greek minority, began seeking refuge in Greece. This exodus turned into a flood by 1991, creating a new reality in Greek-Albanian relations. With the fall of communism in 1991, Orthodox churches were reopened and religious practices were permitted after 35 years of strict prohibition. Moreover, Greek-language education was initially expanded. In 1991 ethnic Greeks shops in the town of Saranda were attacked, and inter-ethnic relations throughout Albania worsened. Greek-Albanian tensions escalated in November 1993 when seven Greek schools were forcibly closed by the Albanian police. A purge of ethnic Greeks in the professions in Albania continued in 1994, with particular emphasis in law and the military.

====Trial of the Omonoia Five====
Tensions increased when on 20 May 1994 the Albanian Government took into custody five members of the ethnic Greek advocacy organization Omonoia on the charge of high treason, accusing them of secessionist activities and illegal possession of weapons (a sixth member was added later). Sentences of six to eight years were handed down. The accusations, the manner in which the trial was conducted and its outcome were strongly criticized by Greece as well as international organizations. Greece responded by freezing all EU aid to Albania, sealing its border with Albania, and between August–November 1994, expelling
over 115,000 illegal Albanian immigrants, a figure quoted in the US Department of State Human Rights Report and given to the American authorities by their Greek counterpart. Tensions increased even further when the Albanian government drafted a law requiring the head of the Orthodox Church in Albania be born in Albania, which would force the then head of the church, the Greek Archbishop Anastasios of Albania from his post. In December 1994, however, Greece began to permit limited EU aid to Albania as a gesture of goodwill, while Albania released two of the Omonoia defendants and reduced the sentences of the remaining four. In 1995, the remaining defendants were released on suspended sentences.

====Recent years====

In recent years relations have significantly improved; Greece and Albania signed a Friendship, Cooperation, Good Neighborliness and Security Agreement on March 21, 1996.

Although relations between Albania and Greece have greatly improved in recent years, the Greek minority in Albania continues to suffer discrimination particularly regarding education in the Greek language, property rights of the minority, and violent incidents against the minority by nationalist extremists. Tensions resurfaced during local government elections in Himara in 2000, when a number of incidents of hostility towards the Greek minority took place, as well as with the defacing of signposts written in Greek in the country&#x27;s south by Albanian nationalist elements, and more recently following the death of Aristotelis Goumas. There were tensions as international talks on Kosovo&#x27;s independence got underway in 2007, and there were also incidents following the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence. Tensions rose again following the 2014 administrative and territorial reform in Albania; and again in 2016 and 2017, following the decision of local authorities in Himara to demolish the homes of 19 ethnic Greek families.

==Demographics==

In Albania, Greeks are considered a &quot;national minority&quot;. There were no reliable statistics on the size of any ethnic minorities, while the latest official census (2011) has been widely disputed due to boycott and irregularities in the procedure.

In general Albania and Greece hold different and often conflicting estimations, as they have done so for the last 20 years. According to data presented to the 1919 Paris Conference, by the Greek side, the Greek minority numbered 120,000, but a CIA report of 1948 put the number at 35,000. The 1989 census under the communist regime cited 58,785 Greeks, while estimations by the Albanian government during the early 1990s raised the number to 80,000.

Most non-Albanian sources have placed the number of ethnic Greeks in Albania, including those who have moved to live in Greece, to be approximately 200,000, while Greek sources claim that there are around 300,000 ethnic Greeks in Albania. As Albanians and Greeks hold different views on what constitutes a Greek in Albania, the total number fluctuates greatly which explains the inconsistent totals provided within Albania and Greece and from external agencies, organisations and sources. Community groups representing Albania&#x27;s Greeks in Greece have given a 286,000 sum. Furthermore, the Migration Policy Institute has noted that 189,000 Albanian immigrants of Greek ancestry live in Greece as &#x27;co-ethnics&#x27;, a title reserved for Albania&#x27;s Greek community members.

However, the area studied was confined to the southern border, and this estimate is considered to be low. Under this definition, minority status was limited to those who lived in 99 villages in the southern border areas, thereby excluding important concentrations of Greek settlement and making the minority seem smaller than it is. Sources from the Greek minority have claimed that there are up to 400,000 Greeks in Albania, or 12% of the total population at the time (from the &quot;Epirot lobby&quot; of Greeks with family roots in Albania). According to Ian Jeffries in 1993, most western estimates of the minority&#x27;s size put it at around 200,000, or ~6% of the population, though a large number, possibly two thirds, has migrated to Greece in recent years.

The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization estimates the Greek minority at approximately 70,000 people. Other independent sources estimate that the number of Greeks in Northern Epirus is 117,000 (about 3.5% of the total population), a figure close to the estimate provided by &quot;The World Factbook (2006)&quot; (about 3%). But this number was 8% by the same agency a year before. The 2014 CIA World Factbook estimate put the Greek minority at 0.9%, which is based on the disputed 2011 census. A 2003 survey conducted by Greek scholars estimate the size of the Greek minority at around 60.000. The US State Department uses a 1.17% figure for Greeks in Albania. In addition an estimated of 189,000 ethnic Greeks who are Albanian citizens reside in Greece.

The Greek minority in Albania is located compactly, within the wider Gjirokastër and Sarandë regions and in four settlements within the coastal Himarë area where they form an overall majority population. Greek speaking settlements are also found within Përmet municipality, near the border. Some Greek speakers are also located within the wider Korçë region. Due to both forced and voluntary internal migration of Greeks within Albania during the communist era, some Greek speakers are also located within the wider Përmet and Tepelenë regions. Outside the area defined as Northern Epirus, two coastal Greek speaking villages exist near Vlorë. While due to forced and non-forced internal population movements of Greeks within Albania during the communist era, some Greek speakers are also dispersed within the wider Berat, Durrës, Kavajë, Peqin, Elbasan and Tiranë regions. In the post-1990 period, like many other minorities elsewhere in Balkans, the Greek population has diminished because of heavy migration. However, after the Greek economic crisis (2009), members of the Greek minority returned to Albania.

==Current issues==

While violent incidents have declined in recent years, the ethnic Greek minority has pursued grievances with the government regarding electoral zones, Greek-language education, and property rights. On the other hand, minority representatives complain of the government&#x27;s unwillingness to recognize the possible existence of ethnic Greek towns outside communist-era &#x27;minority zones&#x27;; to utilize Greek on official documents and on public signs in ethnic Greek areas; to ascertain the size of the ethnic Greek population; and to include more ethnic Greeks in public administration.

===Protests against irregularities in 2011 census===
The census of October 2011 included ethnicity for the first time in post-communist Albania, a long-standing demand of the Greek minority and of international organizations. However, Greek representatives already found this procedure unacceptable due to article 20 of the Census law, which was proposed by the nationalist oriented Party for Justice, Integration and Unity and accepted by the Albanian government. According to this, there is a $1,000 fine for someone who will declare anything other than what was written down on his birth certificate, including certificates from the communist-era where minority status was limited to only 99 villages. Indeed, Omonoia unanimously decided to boycott the census, since it violates the fundamental right of self-determination. Moreover, the Greek government called its Albanian counterpart for urgent action, since the right of free self-determination is not being guaranteed under these circumstances. Vasil Bollano, the head of Omonoia declared that: &quot;We, as minority representatives, state that we do not acknowledge this process, nor its product and we are calling our members to refrain from participating in a census that does not serve the solution of current problems, but their worsening&quot;.

According to the census, there were 17,622 Greeks in the country&#x27;s south (counties of Gjirokastër, Vlorë, and Berat) while 24,243 in Albania in general. Apart from these numbers, an additional 17.29% of the population of those counties refused to answer the optional question of ethnicity (compared to 13.96% of the total population in Albania). On the other hand, Omonoia conducted its own census in order to count the members of the ethnic Greek minority. A total of 286,852 were counted, which equals to ca. 10% of the population of the country. During the time the census was conducted, half of these individuals resided permanently in Greece, but 70% visit their country of origin at least three times a year.

===Land distribution and property in post-communist Albania===

The return to Albania of ethnic Greeks that were expelled during the past regime seemed possible after 1991. However, the return of their confiscated properties is even now impossible, due to Albanian&#x27;s inability to compensate the present owners. Moreover, the full return of the Orthodox Church property also seems impossible for the same reasons.

===Education===

Greek education in the region was thriving during the late Ottoman period (18th–19th centuries). When the First World War broke out in 1914, 360 Greek language schools were functioning in Northern Epirus (as well as in Elbasan, Berat, Tirana) with 23,000 students. In this period, Romanian schools for the Aromanian population of the general region of Epirus were also present, though after the split of the region between Albania and Greece they were progressively closed. Likewise, in Northern Epirus, during the following decades the majority of Greek schools were closed and Greek education was prohibited in most districts. In the post-communist period (after 1991), the reopening of schools was one of the major objectives of the minority. In April 2005 a bilingual Greek-Albanian school in Korçë, and after many years of efforts, a private Greek school was opened in the Himara municipality in spring of 2006.

===Minority zone===
In 1921–1991, there were minority zones where members of national minorities in Albania could exercise their cultural rights. In accordance with the final settlement in the League of Nations on minority populations in Albania, a specific minority zone was established for communities where the majority identified as Greeks in the territory of Albania in 1921. The League of Nations recognized as part of the minority zone 99 settlements in the Gjirokastër-Sarandë areas and 3 villages in Himara (Himarë, Palasë, Dhërmi). After 1945, the minority zone was re-established by the new Albanian government under the Communist Party of Albania and excluded the three villages along the Himara coast. Greeks as an officially recognized national minority held co-equal cultural and political rights within these communities but as these rights were defined on a territorial basis, they were largely absent outside the minority zone. As such, education in Greek which was institutionally protected within the minority zone as well as other rights, didn&#x27;t exist outside this zone and was subject to geographical restrictions.

After 1991, rights which were exclusive to the minority zone were gradually made non-geographical and applicable throughout Albania. As such, the Law on Protection of National Minorities (2017) explicitly stipulates that linguistic and cultural rights of minorities can be exercised &quot;in the entire territory of Albania&quot;. The right to education (funded by state institutions) and the right to use a non-Albanian language in local administration are partially defined territorially and require that at least 20% of the population of an area has to belong to a minority community and request the exercise of such rights.

===Official positions===
====Greece====
In 1991, the Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis specified that the issue, according to the Greek minority in Albania, focuses on 6 major topics that the post-communist Albanian government should deal with:
*The return of the confiscated property of the Orthodox Church and the freedom of religious practice.
*Functioning of Greek language schools (both public and private) in all the areas that Greek populations are concentrated.
*The Greek minority should be allowed to found cultural, religious, educational and social organizations.
*Illegal dismissals of members of the Greek minority from the country&#x27;s public sector should be stopped and same rights for admission should be granted (on every level) for every citizen.
*The Greek families that left Albania during the communist regime (1945–1991), should be encouraged to return to Albania and acquire their lost properties.
*The Albanian government should take the initiative to conduct a census on ethnological basis and give its citizens the right to choose their ethnicity without limitations.

====Albania====
In 1993, the Albanian authorities admitted for the first time that Greek minority members exist not only in the designated &#x27;minority zones&#x27; but all over Albania.
