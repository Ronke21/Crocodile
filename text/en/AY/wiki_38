<text>The Observer is a British newspaper published on Sundays and sister paper to &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Guardian Weekly&quot;. 

First published in 1791, it is the world&#x27;s oldest Sunday newspaper. 
In 1993 it was acquired by their parent company, Guardian Media Group Limited. In December 2024, Tortoise Media acquired the paper from the Scott Trust Limited.

==History==
===Origins===
The first issue, published on 4 December 1791 by W.S. Bourne, was the world&#x27;s first Sunday newspaper. Believing that the paper would be a means of wealth, Bourne instead soon found himself facing debts of nearly £1,600. Though early editions purported editorial independence, Bourne attempted to cut his losses and sell the title to the government. When this failed, Bourne&#x27;s brother (a wealthy businessman) made an offer to the government, which also refused to buy the paper but agreed to subsidise it in return for influence over its editorial content. As a result, the paper soon took a strong line against progressive reformers such as Thomas Paine, Francis Burdett and Joseph Priestley – in contrast to with its contemporary centre-left leaning.

===19th century===
In 1807, the brothers decided to relinquish editorial control, naming Lewis Doxat as the new editor. Seven years later, the brothers sold &quot;The Observer&quot; to William Innell Clement, a newspaper proprietor who owned a number of publications. The paper continued to receive government subsidies during this period; in 1819, of the approximately 23,000 copies of the paper distributed weekly, approximately 10,000 were given away as &quot;specimen copies&quot;, distributed by postmen who were paid to deliver them to &quot;lawyers, doctors, and gentlemen of the town.&quot; 

Clement maintained ownership of &quot;The Observer&quot; until his death in 1852. After Doxat retired in 1857, Clement&#x27;s heirs sold the paper to Joseph Snowe, who also took over the editor&#x27;s chair. 

In 1870, wealthy businessman Julius Beer bought the paper and appointed Edward Dicey as editor, whose efforts succeeded in reviving circulation. Though Beer&#x27;s son Frederick became the owner upon Julius&#x27;s death in 1880, he had little interest in the newspaper and was content to leave Dicey as editor until 1889. Henry Duff Traill took over the editorship after Dicey&#x27;s departure, only to be replaced in 1891 by Frederick&#x27;s wife, Rachel Beer, of the Sassoon family. She remained as editor for thirteen years, combining it in 1893 with the editorship of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, a newspaper that she had also bought..
===20th century===
Upon Frederick&#x27;s death in 1903, the paper was purchased by the newspaper magnate Lord Northcliffe. In 1911, William Waldorf Astor was approached by James Louis Garvin, the editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, about purchasing the newspaper from Northcliffe. Northcliffe and Garvin had a disagreement over the issue of Imperial Preference, and Northcliffe had given Garvin the option of finding a buyer for the paper. 

Northcliffe sold the paper to Astor, who transferred ownership to his son Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor four years later. Astor convinced his father to purchase the paper, which William did on the condition that Garvin also agree to edit the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, which was also a property of the Astor family. Garvin departed as editor in 1942.

Ownership passed to Waldorf&#x27;s sons in 1948, with David taking over as editor. He remained in the position for 27 years, during which time he turned it into a trust-owned newspaper employing, among others, George Orwell, Paul Jennings and C. A. Lejeune. In 1977, the Astors sold the ailing newspaper to US oil giant Atlantic Richfield (now called ARCO) who sold it to Lonrho plc in 1981.

It became part of the Guardian Media Group in June 1993, after a rival acquisition bid by &quot;The Independent&quot; was rejected.

Farzad Bazoft, a journalist for &quot;The Observer&quot;, was executed in Iraq in 1990 on charges of spying. In 2003, &quot;The Observer&quot; interviewed the Iraqi colonel who had arrested and interrogated Bazoft and who was convinced that Bazoft was not a spy.

===21st century===
On 27 February 2005, &quot;The Observer&quot; Blog was launched. In addition to the weekly &quot;Observer Magazine&quot; colour supplement which is still present every Sunday, for several years each issue of &quot;The Observer&quot; came with a different free monthly magazine. These magazines had the titles &quot;Observer Sport Monthly&quot;, &quot;Observer Music Monthly&quot;, &quot;Observer Woman&quot; and &quot;Observer Food Monthly&quot;.

Content from &quot;The Observer&quot; is included in &quot;The Guardian Weekly&quot; for an international readership.

&quot;The Observer&quot; followed its daily partner &quot;The Guardian&quot; and converted to Berliner format on Sunday 8 January 2006.

&quot;The Observer&quot; was awarded the &quot;National Newspaper of the Year&quot; at the British Press Awards 2007. Editor Roger Alton stepped down at the end of 2007, and was replaced by his deputy, John Mulholland.

In early 2010, the paper was restyled. An article on the paper&#x27;s website previewing the new version stated that &quot;The News section, which will incorporate Business and personal finance, will be home to a new section, Seven Days, offering a complete round-up of the previous week&#x27;s main news from Britain and around the world, and will also focus on more analysis and comment.&quot;

In July 2021, Ofcom announced that &quot;The Guardian&quot; continued to be the UK&#x27;s most widely used newspaper website and app for news and had increased its audience share by 1% over the preceding year. 23% of consumers, who used websites or apps for news, used &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which also hosts &quot;The Observer&quot; online content. This compared to 22% for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; website.

====Sale to Tortoise Media====
In September 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; revealed it was in talks to sell &quot;The Observer&quot; to news website Tortoise Media. Journalists at Guardian Media Group passed a vote to condemn the sale and passed a vote of no confidence in the newspaper’s owners, accusing it of betrayal amid concerns that the sale of the paper could harm the financial security of staff members. On 6 December 2024, it was announced that, despite 48 hours of strikes by journalists, the &quot;Observer&quot; deal with Tortoise was agreed in principle and would go ahead. The agreement included the Trust taking a significant stock position in the purchaser.The final sale price has not been disclosed.

On 18 December 2024, Guardian Media and Tortoise Media closed the sale.

==Supplements and features==
After the paper was rejuvenated in early 2010, the main paper came with only a small number of supplements – &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;The Observer Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New Review&quot; and &quot;The New York Times International Weekly&quot;, an 8-page supplement of articles selected from &quot;The New York Times&quot; that has been distributed with the paper since 2007. Every four weeks the paper includes &quot;The Observer Food Monthly&quot; magazine, and in September 2013 it launched &quot;Observer Tech Monthly&quot;, a science and technology section which won the Grand Prix at the 2014 Newspaper Awards.

Previously, the main paper had come with a larger range of supplements including &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;Business &amp; Media&quot;, &quot;Review&quot;, &quot;Escape&quot; (a travel supplement), &quot;The Observer Magazine&quot; and various special interest monthlies, such as &quot;The Observer Food Monthly&quot;, &quot;Observer Women monthly&quot; which was launched in 2006, &quot;Observer Sport Monthly&quot; and &quot;The Observer Film Magazine&quot;.

==The Newsroom==
&quot;The Observer&quot; and its sister newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; operate a visitor centre in London called The Newsroom. It contains their archives, including bound copies of old editions, a photographic library and other items such as diaries, letters and notebooks. This material may be consulted by members of the public. The Newsroom also mounts temporary exhibitions and runs an educational programme for schools.

In November 2007, &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; made their archives available over the Internet. The current extent of the archives available are 1791 to 2000 for &quot;The Observer&quot; and 1821 to 2000 for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. They will eventually go up to 2003. In 2023, copies from 2004 onwards and gaps were to be filled to latest edition.

<text>Extrusomes are membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are capable of discharging material contained within to the exterior of the cell. Due to the diversity in structure and function, it is unlikely that different types of extrusomes are homologous. 

Some notable extrusomes include mucocysts, which discharge a mucous mass sometimes used in cyst formation, and trichocysts, which discharge a fibrous rod. Nematocysts, the stinging structure found in Cnidarian animals, could be considered extrusomes as well, though those functions are performed by differentiated cells rather than organelles. Other extrusomes include the ancoracyst, a specialized extrusome found in the Provoran eukaryote &quot;Ancoracysta twista&quot; used to immobilize prey.

Extrusomes and their functions are currently not well understood; many of their supposed functions are in doubt.

== Function ==

=== In Ciliates ===
Within the ciliates group, numerous extrusomes–primarily trichocysts–are distributed all across the body. In &quot;Paramecium&quot;, there was found to be approximately 8000 extrusome structures per cell. Each of these structures is capable of responding to external mechanical or physical stimuli, upon which the structure will rapidly eject a sharp projectile to serve as a defense mechanism. Expulsion of the trichocyst is generated by a change in the structure of proteins within the shaft of the projectile that drastically increases its length.

Predatory ciliates in the classes Prostomatea and Litostomatea have a type of extrusome called a toxicyst. As their name suggests, when extruded, the toxicyst will release toxic material to inhibit the ciliate’s prey. Haptocysts are found in the class Phyllopharyngea and are found at the tips of feeding tentacles. Prey caught by the tentacles will be held in place when the extrusome injects its contents into it, pinning it in place and releasing enzymes to break the prey down.

Mucocysts are found in ciliates and flagellates. They secrete a mucus directly onto the cell surface that often leads to the formation of cysts. This additional layer may serve as a barrier against foreign substances; it may also be re-ingested alongside any organic matter that was captured within. 

=== In Other Groups ===
Similar to ciliates, most dinoflagellates have trichocysts capable of ejecting a sharp spindle. Though long believed to be genetically dissimilar, recent studies of ribosomal DNA have yielded evidence towards them being more related despite the physiological differences.

Cryptomonads, a group of algae, have a type of extrusomes referred to as ejectosomes. These structures have two connected spiral ribbon-like structures held under tension. When placed under stress, whether mechanical, chemical, or light, the ejectosome will discharge, propelling the protist away from the disturbance.

Cnidocyst, the organelle associated with the stinging cnidocyte cells of jellyfish and other Cnidarians, are another type of extrusome. When the hair-like trigger called the cnidocil receives a chemical or mechanical input, the coiled hollow tube within is ejected, piercing and injecting the target organism with toxin. The time it takes for the entire process to occur is only a few microseconds, and has been measured to reach an acceleration of approximately 40,000 g.

<doc id="191090" wikidata="Q2665980" url="?curid=191090" title="Guardian Media Group">
<text>Guardian Media Group plc (GMG) is a British-based mass media company owning various media operations including &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;. The group is wholly owned by the Scott Trust Limited, which exists to secure the financial and editorial independence of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in perpetuity.

The Group&#x27;s annual report (for the year ending 2 April 2023) indicated that the Scott Trust Endowment Fund was valued at £1.24 billion, while in 2021 it was valued at £1.14 billion.

==History==
The company was founded as the Manchester Guardian Ltd. in 1907 when C.P. Scott bought &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; (founded in 1821) from the estate of his cousin Edward Taylor.

It became the Manchester Guardian and Evening News Ltd when it bought out the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; in 1924, later becoming the Guardian and Manchester Evening News Ltd to reflect the change in the morning paper&#x27;s title. It adopted its current name in 1993. 

In 1991, it had a 20% stake in a consortium which included London Weekend Television, Scottish Television, The Walt Disney Company and Carlton Communications for a new ITV breakfast franchise called GMTV.

&quot;Guardian Monthly&quot; was a glossy magazine published by the Guardian Media Group for readers around the world. Launched in November 2006, it made selections from &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;″s magazine supplements available to an international audience of English-speakers. Issues contained interviews with cultural figures, features about world issues, and regular articles on travel, books, sport, health, fashion, food and photography. In July 2007, the Guardian Media Group announced the cancellation of the &quot;Guardian Monthly&quot;. In a letter to subscribers, Will Ricketts, &quot;Guardian Monthly&quot;&#x27;s publisher, explained the reasons for the cancellation of the monthly magazine:
In March 2007, GMG sold 49.9% of Trader Media Group to Apax Partners, in a deal that valued Trader Media Group at £1.35 billion. In December 2007, it was announced that GMG and Apax had made a successful bid to buy Emap&#x27;s business-to-business arm for around £1 billion.

In February 2010, the group sold its GMG Regional Media division (consisting of two companies MEN Media and S&amp;B Media which operated 31 local and regional newspaper titles) to Trinity Mirror for £44.8 million. The sale eroded the connection between &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Manchester as the sale of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; was included in the package. The division&#x27;s local television station for Greater Manchester, Channel M, and two newspapers in Woking were not included in the sale.

In June 2012, GMG sold its GMG Radio division, which operated Real Radio and Smooth Radio, to Global Radio.

In January 2014, GMG disposed of its remaining interest in Trader Media Group.

Carolyn McCall was the chief executive of Guardian Media Group and chair of Guardian News and Media Limited from 2006 until June 2010, when she was appointed chief executive of EasyJet. Andrew Miller, previously the chief financial officer of the Group, was chief executive from July 2010 to 2015. David Pemsel took his place in 2015.

In October 2017, the Guardian Media Group reported a plan to launch a new £42 million venture capital fund. That plan was consummated, making the Scott Trust a limited partner in GMG Ventures LP. According to the GMG 2018 annual report, &quot;this £42m venture capital fund is designed to contribute financial returns and to support GMG&#x27;s strategy by investing in early stage businesses focused on developing the next generation of media technology&quot;.

In January 2020, it was announced that Annette Thomas would become the new chief executive in March 2020. Thomas was formerly editor of &quot;Nature&quot;, MD of Nature Publishing Group and chief executive of Macmillan Science and Education. She replaced David Pemsel who left to take up a role at the Premier League.

In May 2021, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported &quot;Guardian&quot; editor Katharine Viner and Thomas were in conflict over finances and the direction the newspaper should take. The previous year &quot;The Guardian&quot; announced 180 job cuts. Thomas had earlier said at a media industry conference &quot;we have quality content in spades ... the job at hand is to now go further by strengthening the growing elements of our business&quot;. Viner wanted renewed investment after better than feared financial results in 2020. On 9 June 2021, it was announced that Thomas would leave the Guardian Media Group at the end of the month.

In August 2022, Anna Bateson was appointed as chief executive. Subsequently Anders Jensen, chief executive of Viaplay, resigned as a GMG non-executive director because of the appointment process, in particular the level of influence exerted by &quot;Guardian&quot; editor Katharine Viner.

In September 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; revealed it was in talks to sell &quot;The Observer&quot; to news website Tortoise Media. Journalists at Guardian Media Group voted to condemn the sale and passed a vote of no confidence in the newspaper&#x27;s owners, accusing it of betrayal amid concerns that the sale of the paper could harm the financial security of staff members.

==Group structure==

GMG&#x27;s core business is Guardian News &amp; Media Limited, publisher of theguardian.com, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; newspapers. Guardian News &amp; Media was formed as Guardian Newspapers Limited in 1967, adopting its present name in 2006.

The group has a portfolio of investments to help support its journalism. They comprise:
* Ascential: an international business-to-business digital intelligence and events business.
* An externally managed investment fund.

Guardian Media Group exists to support the core purpose of its owner, Scott Trust Limited: to secure the financial and editorial independence of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in perpetuity, but in the 2011/12 year the group lost £75.6 million, and for the three years up to June 2012, the paper itself lost £100,000 a day - leading &quot;The Economist&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Intelligent Life&quot; magazine to question whether &quot;The Guardian&quot; could survive. In late 2013, GMG sold their GMG Property Services Group to private equity firm Lloyds Development Capital (rebranded to Property Software Group), citing that it would allow them to focus on investing in the core part of their business—Guardian News and Media. In 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; launched a membership scheme, aiming to avoid introducing a paywall and maintaining open access to the website. As of 2018, this approach was considered successful, having brought more than 1 million subscriptions or donations, with the paper hoping to break even by April 2019, a goal they achieved in May 2019.

<doc id="191091" wikidata="Q3231290" url="?curid=191091" title="Magic Tree House">
<text>Magic Tree House is an American children&#x27;s series written by American author Mary Pope Osborne. The original American series was illustrated by Salvatore Murdocca until 2016, after which AG Ford took over . Other illustrators have been used for foreign-language editions.

The series is divided into two groups. The first group consists of Books 1–39, in which Morgan Le Fay sends Jack and Annie Smith, siblings from the fictional small town of Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, on adventures and missions through a magical tree house. The second group, called &quot;Magic Tree House: Merlin Missions&quot;, begins with Book 1, &quot;Christmas in Camelot,&quot; and has ancient wizard Merlin the Magician giving Jack and Annie quests. These books are longer than others, and some take place in fantasy realms such as Camelot. Kathleen and Teddy are apprentices who befriend Jack and Annie and provide support, occasionally joining them on adventures. In &quot;Super Edition #1&quot;, Teddy sends them on a mission instead of Morgan or Merlin. The companion &quot;Magic Tree House Fact Trackers&quot; are co-written by Mary Pope Osborne with her husband Will Osborne or sister Natalie Pope Boyce.

== Series background ==
After graduating from college, Mrs. Osborne and a friend went traveling. Mrs. Osborne spent time in Crete and traveled through Iraq, Iran, India, Afghanistan, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, and Pakistan. The trip ended when Mrs. Osborne experienced blood poisoning in Nepal and was hospitalized for several weeks, during which she read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Remarking on her travels, Mrs. Osborne said, &quot;That journey irrevocably changed me. The experience gathered serves as a reference point every day of my life. I encountered worlds of light and worlds of darkness — and planted seeds of the imagination that led directly to my being an author of children&#x27;s books.&quot;

Mrs. Osborne&#x27;s travels and experiences have largely factored into her writing, which has allowed her to experience the thrills of traveling. She has stated that, &quot;Without even leaving my home, I’ve traveled around the globe, learning about the religions of the world.&quot;

Mrs. Osborne&#x27;s writing career began &quot;one day, out of the blue&quot; when she wrote &quot;Run, Run As Fast As You Can&quot; in 1982, which she has said is semi-autobiographical, as she stated: &quot;The girl was a lot like me and many of the incidents in the story were similar to happenings in my childhood.&quot; The book served as the starting point for Mrs. Osborne&#x27;s writing career; her early work received mixed reviews. Her work includes young adult novels, picture books, retellings of mythology and fairy tales, biographies, mysteries, a six-part series of the Odyssey, a book of American Tall Tales, and a book for young readers about major world religions.

The idea for the series came when Penguin Random House asked Mrs. Osborne to start writing a series of children&#x27;s books. Mrs. Osborne knew from the beginning that she wanted to include time travel, and the idea for the treehouse as the means of time travel came to her when she and her husband saw one while on a walk in the forest in Pennsylvania.

Mrs. Osborne says that she can work on &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; up to 12 hours a day and seven days a week and has used space at shared office space, The Writer&#x27;s Room. She has modeled her writing after Hemingway by trying to be simple and direct and is &quot;noted for writing clear, lively, well-paced prose in both her stories and her informational books.&quot;

== Main characters ==
When Mrs. Osborne started writing the series, she wrote Jack as a main character and added Annie as a typical annoying younger sister. After writing her in, Osborne eventually decided to make her a main character. Mrs. Osborne highlights Annie’s bravery as a characteristic that is the main difference between Annie and herself, as Mrs. Osborne has noted she often wished she was braver.

=== Jack ===
Jack is the older brother, who is known for his love of books and learning, an attribute Osborne says connects her to him. He tends to be cautious. According to the original illustrations by Sal Murdocca, Jack has brown hair, wears red glasses, and is taller than Annie.

=== Annie ===
Annie is the younger sister, who is known for her bravery, impulsive decisions, and caring for the people and animals around her. According to the original illustrations by Sal Murdocca, Annie is depicted as having medium-length blonde hair, often worn in double braids, and bangs.

== Legacy ==
Mary Pope Osborne&#x27;s books have been featured in several Best Books of the Year Lists, including School Library Journal, Parents’ Magazine, The Bulletin of the Center for Children&#x27;s Books, and Bank Street College of Education. She has received honors from organizations as the National Council of Teachers of English, The Children&#x27;s Book Council, and the International Reading Association. She received the 1992 Diamond State Reading Association Award, 2005 Ludington Memorial Award from the Educational Paperback Association and the 2010 Heidelberger Leander Award. She has also received awards from the Carolina Alumni Association, the Virginia Library Association and in spring 2013, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Mrs. Osborne served two separate terms as president of the Authors Guild and also chaired its Children&#x27;s Book Committee. She has since traveled extensively in the states and throughout the world, visiting schools and speaking on issues related to reading and books. In 2011, she attended the Tokyo International Film Festival for the premiere of the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; anime film and visited schools in the tsunami-hit area of Japan. The film grossed 5.7 million dollars; Mrs. Osborne donated all proceeds into her educational works.

She was profiled on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot; for her continued efforts to give children books while on a &quot;Magic Tree House&quot;-themed tour bus. She spoke of the pressure she feels as an author that children look up to, &quot;for a child to value someone who writes books is so extraordinary.&quot;

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; series in 2012, Mrs. Osborne created a &quot;Magic Tree House Classroom Adventures Program,&quot; through which she aims to inspire children to read and love reading while helping them to read at grade level by the end of 3rd grade. The program is free of charge and provides a set of online educational resources for teachers and allows for Title 1 schools to apply for free &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; books. Under &quot;Classroom Adventures&quot;, Mrs. Osborne, in partnership with the First Book organization in Washington, D.C., has donated hundreds of thousands of &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; books to underserved schools.

==Adaptations==
=== Magic Tree House Children&#x27;s Theatre ===
The &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; brand has expanded into other forms. A musical adaptation, &quot;Magic Tree House: The Musical,&quot; was created by Will Osborne and Randy Court based on &quot;Christmas in Camelot&quot; and premiered in September 2007. Osborne hoped that it would have appeal to both kids and adults, like &quot;The Lion King&quot; or &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. The musical has toured nationally and had a cast album.

A planetarium show, &quot;Magic Tree House: Space Mission&quot;, also created by Will Osborne, is produced and presented at the Morehead Planetarium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

In 2011, Will Osborne collaborated with New Orleans composer Allen Toussaint and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&quot;&#x27; co-creator Murray Horwitz to write &quot;A Night in New Orleans&quot;, a musical adaptation of &quot;A Good Night for Ghosts&quot; about the life of Louis Armstrong which features an ensemble cast and live jazz band. It premiered in 2012 at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and was shown free to Newark 4th grade students.

&quot;Magic Tree House Kids Shows&quot; are theatrical adaptations of select titles in the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; series designed specifically for kids&#x27; performances. To date, children&#x27;s shows have been created by husband and wife playwright and composer team Randy Courts and Jenny Laird in collaboration with Will Osborne based on &quot;Dinosaurs Before Dark&quot;, &quot;The Knight at Dawn&quot;, &quot;Pirates Past Noon&quot;, &quot;A Ghost Tale for Christmas Time&quot;, and &quot;A Night in New Orleans&quot;. &quot;Stage Fright on a Summer Night&quot;, based on the life of William Shakespeare, premiered at the Orlando Shakespeare Theatre in October 2017.

=== Film adaptation ===
The animated film , produced by Media Factory, premiered in Japan in October 2011 and was released there on January 7, 2012.

&quot;Magic Tree House: Merlin Missions&quot; Books 1-27 were written for more advanced readers ages 7–10. The &quot;Magic Tree House: Merlin Missions&quot; were originally ordered sequentially, starting at Book #29 (&quot;Christmas in Camelot&quot;). With the 25th anniversary re-prints, the books have been separated into their own distinct series and re-numbered starting at &quot;Merlin Mission #1&quot;.

The &quot;Magic Tree House Fact Trackers&quot; (formerly called &quot;Magic Tree House Research Guides&quot;) are non-fiction companions to the fiction books written by Mary Pope Osborne, Will Osborne, and Natalie Pope Boyce, which provide more in-depth information on topics featured in the series. They were first released in 2000 by Scholastic and Random House. 44 have been published. The first two Fact Trackers were published in August 2000 as companions for the first two stories. In 2008, book #39, &quot;Dark Day in the Deep Sea,&quot; and its fact tracker, #17, &quot;Sea Monsters,&quot; were the first story and fact tracker to be published simultaneously.

<text>Nunavik (; ; ) is an area in Canada which comprises the northern third of the province of Quebec, part of the Nord-du-Québec region and nearly coterminous with Kativik. Covering a land area of north of the 55th parallel, it is the homeland of the Inuit of Quebec and part of the wider Inuit Nunangat. Almost all of the 14,045 inhabitants (2021 census) of the region, of whom 90% are Inuit, live in fourteen northern villages on the coast of Nunavik and in the Cree reserved land (TC) of Whapmagoostui, near the northern village of Kuujjuarapik.

 means &quot;great land&quot; in the local dialect of Inuktitut and the Inuit inhabitants of the region call themselves . Until 1912, the region was part of the District of Ungava of the Northwest Territories.

Negotiations for regional autonomy and resolution of outstanding land claims took place in the 2000s. The seat of government would be Kuujjuaq. Negotiations on better empowering Inuit political rights in their land are still ongoing.

A flag for Nunavik was proposed by Nunavik artist and graphic designer Thomassie Mangiok during an April 2013 Plan Nunavik consultation in Ivujivik.

==History==

Concern about Canada&#x27;s claims to sovereignty in the high Arctic resulted in the high Arctic relocation, where the federal government of Canada forced several Inuit families to leave Nunavik in the 1950s. They were transported much further north, to barren hamlets at Grise Fiord and Resolute in what is now Nunavut in an effort to demonstrate Canada&#x27;s legal occupation of these territories and thereby assert sovereignty in the high Arctic by increasing its population during the Cold War. Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak (on the Ungava Peninsula) were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife. They were told that they would be returned home to Nunavik after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada&#x27;s claims to sovereignty in the High Arctic area and the Inuit were forced to stay. Eventually, the Inuit learned the local beluga whale migration routes and were able to survive in the area, hunting over a range of each year.

In 1993, the Canadian government held hearings to investigate the relocation program. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples issued a report the following year entitled &quot;The High Arctic Relocation: A Report on the 1953–55 Relocation&quot;. The government paid $10 million CAD to the survivors and their families, and finally apologized in 2010. The whole story is told in Melanie McGrath&#x27;s &quot;The Long Exile: A Tale of Inuit Betrayal and Survival in the High Arctic&quot;.

Nunavik and other parts of northern Quebec were part of Northwest Territories from 1870 to 1912. In 1912, the area was transferred to Quebec; however, the province did little in the area until after the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s. In the 1960s, René Lévesque played a major role in expansion of hydroelectric power in the province. The region was named &quot;Nouveau-Québec&quot;, many place names were francized, and the teaching of French was spread in schools in the region. This cultural encroachment paired with the James Bay Project resulted in the first political organizing of Inuit in Canada in the Northern Quebec Inuit Association which fought for the eventual James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. This agreement laid the initial legal groundwork for the creation of Nunavik within Quebec.

==Geography==
Nunavik is a vast territory located in the northernmost part of Quebec. It lies in both the Arctic and subarctic climate zones. Altogether, about 12,000 people live in Nunavik&#x27;s communities, and this number has been growing in line with the tendency for high population growth in indigenous communities.

Nunavik is separated from the territory of Nunavut by Hudson Bay to the west and Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay to the north. Nunavik shares a border with the Côte-Nord region of Quebec and the Labrador region of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Ungava Peninsula forms the northern two-thirds of the region. There are no road links between Nunavik and southern Quebec, although the Trans-Taiga Road of the Jamésie region ends near the 55th parallel on the Caniapiscau Reservoir, several hundred kilometres south of Kuujjuaq. There is a year-round air link to all villages and seasonal shipping in the summer and autumn. Parts of the interior of southern Nunavik can be reached using several trails which head north from Schefferville.

Nunavik has fourteen villages, the vast majority of whose residents are Inuit. The principal village and administrative centre in Nunavik is Kuujjuaq, on the southern shore of Ungava Bay; the other villages are Inukjuak (where the film &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; was shot), Salluit, Puvirnituq, Ivujivik, Kangiqsujuaq, Kangiqsualujjuaq, Kangirsuk, Tasiujaq, Aupaluk, Akulivik, Quaqtaq, Kuujjuarapik and Umiujaq. The village population (census 2011) ranges from 2,375 (Kuujjuaq) to 195 (Aupaluk).

There are five meteorite craters in Nunavik: Pingualuit crater, Couture crater, La Moinerie crater and the two craters that together form the Clearwater Lakes.

==Climate==
Nunavik is dominated by tundra, which is characterized by its limited vegetation and low temperatures. Nunavik&#x27;s climate features long and cold winters as the seas to the west, east and north freeze over, eliminating maritime moderation. Since this moderation exists in summer when the surrounding sea thaws, even those temperatures are subdued. Inukjuak for example has summer highs averaging just 13 °C (55 °F) with January highs of −21 °C (−6 °F). This is exceptionally cold for a sea-level settlement more than 1/3 of the way from the North Pole to the Equator. Annual temperatures are up to 15 °C (27 °F) colder than marine areas of Northern Europe on similar parallels. Areas less affected by summertime marine moderation have somewhat warmer temperatures and unlike the west coast, feature marginal taiga due to summers being warmer than 10 °C (50 °F) in mean temperatures.

===Climate change and environment===
Climate change studies in Nunavik have employed community-based research methods, synthesizing traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and quantitative data, and provide new insights into observable changes occurring in the Arctic. Indigenous communities have reported shorter, warmer winters in recent years, and have observed resulting changes in various environmental factors – including vegetation growth, precipitation, sea ice and permafrost, water levels and quality, as well as the presence of lead in the environment.

Vegetation growth is limited in Nunavik, mostly consisting of shrubs, grasses, and mosses. Although tree growth in the tundra is scarce, some tree species such as the Arctic Willow and Balsam Poplar are found in this region. Nunavik is also home to a variety of berry plants, including Cloudberry, Blueberry, Blackberry (Crowberry), and Cranberry (Redberry). Tree and shrub growth has been observed to be increasing in Nunavik in past years due to warming temperatures.

Furthermore, sea ice is thinning and decreasing in longevity through the winters. This creates more risky areas for transportation over the ice. There have also been lowering fresh water levels reported due to decreasing annual precipitation in the Arctic.

These changes are presenting potential threats to the health of communities and people that use water from natural sources. Lowering water quality in Nunavik can be associated with Gastrointestinal diseases, for example Giardia. Cases of Gastrointestinal diseases associated with natural sources were reported to increase in March when the sea ice begins breaking up, as well as in fall during the Caribou migration period.

Environmental levels of lead have also been changing in the Arctic with climatic shifts, presenting concerns for lead poisoning in northern communities. In Nunavik, Lead concentrations in maternal blood were the highest in Canada (50 μg/L). Increasing levels of lead in the environment are also associated with the use of the lead shot in hunting, which was banned in 1999 (although lead shots continue to be shipped to northern communities).

===Villages by population===

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===Ethnicity===
In 2019, a scientific study by researchers from the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital of the McGill University found that the Nunavik Inuit are genetically distinct from any other known population. They possess distinct genetic signatures in pathways linked to lipid metabolism, allowing them to adjust to higher-fat diets and the extreme temperature of the Canadian Arctic. Geographically isolated populations often develop unique genetic traits that result from their successful adaptation to specific environments. Their closest relatives are the Paleo-Eskimos, a people that inhabited the Arctic before the Inuit. 

===Language===
The following table does not include Canada&#x27;s official languages of French and English.
==Economy==
Nunavik is rich in mineral deposits where Raglan Mine, situated near Salluit, is one of the largest mines in the region. It is linked by all-weather roads to an airstrip at Kattiniq/Donaldson Airport and to the concentrate, storage and ship-loading facilities at Deception Bay. Production began at the mine in 1997. The current mine life is estimated at more than 30 years. 

Because the site is situated in the subarctic permafrost region, it requires special construction and mining techniques to protect the fragile permafrost and to address other environmental issues. The average annual temperature is with an average ambient temperature underground of . There are plans to increase production at a new mine in Raglan South.

==Arts and culture==
The villages of Nunavik are populated predominately by Inuit. Much like their Nunavummiut neighbours to the North, the Nunavimmiut carve sculptures from soapstone and eat primarily caribou and fish. On clear nights, the aurora is often visible, and outdoor activities are abundant in this region.

==Government==
Nunavik, along with the Quebec portion of the James Bay region (or Jamésie in French), is part of the administrative region of Nord-du-Québec. The James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement of 1978 led to greater political autonomy for most of the Nunavik region with the founding of the Kativik Regional Government. All inhabitants of the 14 northern villages, both Inuit and non-Inuit, vote in regional elections. The Kativik Regional Government is financed by the Government of Quebec (50%), the Government of Canada (25%), and local revenues (25%). The Agreement also led to the creation of the Kativik Regional Police Force, which has been providing police services in the Kativik region since 1996. The KRPF was renamed as the Nunavik Police Service (NPS) in mid-2021.

The Makivik Corporation, headquartered in Kuujjuaq, represents the Inuit of Northern Quebec in their relations with the governments of Quebec and Canada. They are seeking greater political autonomy for the region and have recently negotiated an agreement defining their traditional rights to use the resources of the offshore islands of Nunavik, all of which are part of Nunavut.

The Cree village of Whapmagoostui, which forms an enclave on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay near the northern village of Kuujjuarapik, is part of the Cree Regional Authority, which itself has been incorporated into the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee). The Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach, of the Côte-Nord region to the south of Nunavik, owns an exclusive hunting and trapping area in southern Nunavik and is represented in the Kativik Regional Government.

===Regional Government of Nunavik===
The governments of Quebec, Canada, and Nunavik had negotiated a proposal to establish a Regional Government of Nunavik. This is in part a recognition of the region&#x27;s political distinctiveness, having a different language, culture, climate and voting pattern from the rest of the province of Quebec, as well as part of the overall trend towards devolution of Canada&#x27;s arctic territories. While Quebec and Canada would still maintain full jurisdiction over the area, the Nunavik government will have an elected parliamentary-style council and cabinet, and a public service funded by the province and responsible for delivering certain social services such as education and health. The regional government would have also had rights to the region&#x27;s natural resources, including royalties from the various mines in the region. This proposal was rejected by about 66% of voters in a referendum in 2011. It is expected that negotiations will continue in the future to work to establish a more autonomous government for Nunavik in the future.

The government will be based on territory, not ethnicity so that all people residing in Nunavik can be full participants. Existing government structures, such as the Kativik Regional Government, Kativik School Board, and Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services, will be folded into the new regional government.

The Quebec government has also expressed a desire to add an additional seat to the National Assembly to represent Nunavik, despite the region&#x27;s small population. Currently, Nunavik is part of the riding of Ungava, its residents making up just under half of the riding&#x27;s population. As a riding, Nunavik would be the second least populous in Quebec, slightly more populous than Îles-de-la-Madeleine, which is able to exist as a separate riding under an exception to the laws on population distribution by riding.

<text>John George Hohman (also spelled Johann Georg Hohman, and his surname sometimes misspelled as Hoffman) was a German-American printer, book seller and compiler of collections of herbal remedies, magical healings, and charms. He immigrated to the USA from Germany in 1802, settled in the area around Reading, Pennsylvania, in the Pennsylvania Dutch community, where he printed and sold broadsides, chapbooks and books and practised and instructed in the arts of folk magic and folk religion which became known as pow-wow. He was active between 1802 and 1846.

Hohman&#x27;s best known work is the collection of prayers and recipes for folk-healing titled &quot;Pow-Wows&quot;, or the &quot;Long Lost Friend&quot;, published in German in 1820 as &quot;Der Lange Verborgene Freund&quot; (The Long-Hidden Friend) and in two English translations—the first in 1846 in a rather crude translation by Hohman himself (&quot;The Long Secreted Friend or a True and Christian Information for Every Body&quot;) and the second in 1856 by a different and more fluent translator (&quot;The Long Lost Friend; a Collection of Mysterious and Invaluable Arts and Remedies for Man as well as Animals&quot;). The name &quot;Pow-Wows&quot; was only added to the book in late 19th century reprints in the wake of the sudden popularity of Spiritualism in the United States, in which &quot;Indian Spirit Guides&quot; were frequently seen during seances.

In addition to &quot;The Long-Lost-Friend,&quot; Hohman also wrote and published, or at least had attributed to him, a number of further books in German, including &quot;Unsers Herran Jesu Christi Kinderbuch, oder, Merkwurdige Historische Beschreibung Von Joachim Und Anna&quot; (Our Lord Jesus Christ&#x27;s Childhood-Book, or, The Strange Historical Description of Joachim and Anna), and &quot;Albertus Magnus, oder, Der Lange Verborgene und Getreuer und Christlicher Unterricht fur Jedermann&quot; (Albertus Magnus, or, Long Lost and True and Christian Instructions for Everyone). The last book attributed to Hohman was published in 1857.

<text>In the mathematical field of dynamical systems, an attractor is a set of states toward which a system tends to evolve, for a wide variety of starting conditions of the system. System values that get close enough to the attractor values remain close even if slightly disturbed.

In finite-dimensional systems, the evolving variable may be represented algebraically as an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector. The attractor is a region in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space. In physical systems, the &quot;n&quot; dimensions may be, for example, two or three positional coordinates for each of one or more physical entities; in economic systems, they may be separate variables such as the inflation rate and the unemployment rate.

If the evolving variable is two- or three-dimensional, the attractor of the dynamic process can be represented geometrically in two or three dimensions, (as for example in the three-dimensional case depicted to the right). An attractor can be a point, a finite set of points, a curve, a manifold, or even a complicated set with a fractal structure known as a &quot;strange attractor&quot; (see strange attractor below). If the variable is a scalar, the attractor is a subset of the real number line. Describing the attractors of chaotic dynamical systems has been one of the achievements of chaos theory.

A trajectory of the dynamical system in the attractor does not have to satisfy any special constraints except for remaining on the attractor, forward in time. The trajectory may be periodic or chaotic. If a set of points is periodic or chaotic, but the flow in the neighborhood is away from the set, the set is not an attractor, but instead is called a &quot;repeller&quot; (or &quot;repellor&quot;).

== Motivation of attractors ==
A dynamical system is generally described by one or more differential or difference equations. The equations of a given dynamical system specify its behavior over any given short period of time. To determine the system&#x27;s behavior for a longer period, it is often necessary to integrate the equations, either through analytical means or through iteration, often with the aid of computers.

Dynamical systems in the physical world tend to arise from dissipative systems: if it were not for some driving force, the motion would cease. (Dissipation may come from internal friction, thermodynamic losses, or loss of material, among many causes.) The dissipation and the driving force tend to balance, killing off initial transients and settle the system into its typical behavior. The subset of the phase space of the dynamical system corresponding to the typical behavior is the attractor, also known as the attracting section or attractee.

Invariant sets and limit sets are similar to the attractor concept. An &quot;invariant set&quot; is a set that evolves to itself under the dynamics. Attractors may contain invariant sets. A &quot;limit set&quot; is a set of points such that there exists some initial state that ends up arbitrarily close to the limit set (i.e. to each point of the set) as time goes to infinity. Attractors are limit sets, but not all limit sets are attractors: It is possible to have some points of a system converge to a limit set, but different points when perturbed slightly off the limit set may get knocked off and never return to the vicinity of the limit set.

For example, the damped pendulum has two invariant points: the point of minimum height and the point of maximum height. The point is also a limit set, as trajectories converge to it; the point is not a limit set. Because of the dissipation due to air resistance, the point is also an attractor. If there was no dissipation, would not be an attractor. Aristotle believed that objects moved only as long as they were pushed, which is an early formulation of a dissipative attractor.

Some attractors are known to be chaotic (see strange attractor), in which case the evolution of any two distinct points of the attractor result in exponentially diverging trajectories, which complicates prediction when even the smallest noise is present in the system.

== Mathematical definition ==
Let formula_1 represent time and let formula_2 be a function which specifies the dynamics of the system. That is, if formula_3 is a point in an formula_4-dimensional phase space, representing the initial state of the system, then formula_5 and, for a positive value of formula_1, formula_7 is the result of the evolution of this state after formula_1 units of time. For example, if the system describes the evolution of a free particle in one dimension then the phase space is the plane formula_9 with coordinates formula_10, where formula_11 is the position of the particle, formula_12 is its velocity, formula_13, and the evolution is given by

: formula_14

An attractor is a subset formula_15 of the phase space characterized by the following three conditions:
* formula_15 is &quot;forward invariant&quot; under formula_17: if formula_3 is an element of formula_15 then so is formula_7, for all formula_21.
* There exists a neighborhood of formula_15, called the &quot;basin of attraction&quot; for formula_15 and denoted formula_24, which consists of all points formula_25 that &quot;enter&quot; formula_15 in the limit formula_27. More formally, formula_24 is the set of all points formula_25 in the phase space with the following property:
:: For any open neighborhood formula_30 of formula_15, there is a positive constant formula_32 such that formula_33 for all real formula_34.
* There is no proper (non-empty) subset of formula_15 having the first two properties.

Since the basin of attraction contains an open set containing formula_15, every point that is sufficiently close to formula_15 is attracted to formula_15. The definition of an attractor uses a metric on the phase space, but the resulting notion usually depends only on the topology of the phase space. In the case of formula_39, the Euclidean norm is typically used.

Many other definitions of attractor occur in the literature. For example, some authors require that an attractor have positive measure (preventing a point from being an attractor), others relax the requirement that formula_24 be a neighborhood.

== Types of attractors ==
Attractors are portions or subsets of the phase space of a dynamical system. Until the 1960s, attractors were thought of as being simple geometric subsets of the phase space, like points, lines, surfaces, and simple regions of three-dimensional space. More complex attractors that cannot be categorized as simple geometric subsets, such as topologically wild sets, were known of at the time but were thought to be fragile anomalies. Stephen Smale was able to show that his horseshoe map was robust and that its attractor had the structure of a Cantor set.

Two simple attractors are a fixed point and the limit cycle. Attractors can take on many other geometric shapes (phase space subsets). But when these sets (or the motions within them) cannot be easily described as simple combinations (e.g. intersection and union) of fundamental geometric objects (e.g. lines, surfaces, spheres, toroids, manifolds), then the attractor is called a &quot;strange attractor&quot;.

=== Fixed point ===

A fixed point of a function or transformation is a point that is mapped to itself by the function or transformation. If we regard the evolution of a dynamical system as a series of transformations, then there may or may not be a point which remains fixed under each transformation. The final state that a dynamical system evolves towards corresponds to an attracting fixed point of the evolution function for that system, such as the center bottom position of a damped pendulum, the level and flat water line of sloshing water in a glass, or the bottom center of a bowl containing a rolling marble. But the fixed point(s) of a dynamic system is not necessarily an attractor of the system. For example, if the bowl containing a rolling marble was inverted and the marble was balanced on top of the bowl, the center bottom (now top) of the bowl is a fixed state, but not an attractor. This is equivalent to the difference between stable and unstable equilibria. In the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl (a hill), that point at the top of the bowl (hill) is a fixed point (equilibrium), but not an attractor (unstable equilibrium).

In addition, physical dynamic systems with at least one fixed point invariably have multiple fixed points and attractors due to the reality of dynamics in the physical world, including the nonlinear dynamics of stiction, friction, surface roughness, deformation (both elastic and plasticity), and even quantum mechanics. In the case of a marble on top of an inverted bowl, even if the bowl seems perfectly hemispherical, and the marble&#x27;s spherical shape, are both much more complex surfaces when examined under a microscope, and their shapes change or deform during contact. Any physical surface can be seen to have a rough terrain of multiple peaks, valleys, saddle points, ridges, ravines, and plains. There are many points in this surface terrain (and the dynamic system of a similarly rough marble rolling around on this microscopic terrain) that are considered stationary or fixed points, some of which are categorized as attractors.

===Finite number of points===

In a discrete-time system, an attractor can take the form of a finite number of points that are visited in sequence. Each of these points is called a periodic point. This is illustrated by the logistic map, which depending on its specific parameter value can have an attractor consisting of 1 point, 2 points, 2&quot;n&quot; points, 3 points, 3×2&quot;n&quot; points, 4 points, 5 points, or any given positive integer number of points.

=== Limit cycle ===

A limit cycle is a periodic orbit of a continuous dynamical system that is isolated. It concerns a cyclic attractor. Examples include the swings of a pendulum clock, and the heartbeat while resting. The limit cycle of an ideal pendulum is not an example of a limit cycle attractor because its orbits are not isolated: in the phase space of the ideal pendulum, near any point of a periodic orbit there is another point that belongs to a different periodic orbit, so the former orbit is not attracting. For a physical pendulum under friction, the resting state will be a fixed-point attractor. The difference with the clock pendulum is that there, energy is injected by the escapement mechanism to maintain the cycle.

=== Limit torus ===
There may be more than one frequency in the periodic trajectory of the system through the state of a limit cycle. For example, in physics, one frequency may dictate the rate at which a planet orbits a star while a second frequency describes the oscillations in the distance between the two bodies. If two of these frequencies form an irrational fraction (i.e. they are incommensurate), the trajectory is no longer closed, and the limit cycle becomes a limit torus. This kind of attractor is called an -torus if there are incommensurate frequencies. For example, here is a 2-torus:

A time series corresponding to this attractor is a quasiperiodic series: A discretely sampled sum of periodic functions (not necessarily sine waves) with incommensurate frequencies. Such a time series does not have a strict periodicity, but its power spectrum still consists only of sharp lines.

=== Strange attractor ===
An attractor is called &quot;strange&quot; if it has a fractal structure, that is if it has non-integer Hausdorff dimension. This is often the case when the dynamics on it are chaotic, but strange nonchaotic attractors also exist. If a strange attractor is chaotic, exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions, then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor, after any of various numbers of iterations, will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart (subject to the confines of the attractor), and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together. Thus a dynamic system with a chaotic attractor is locally unstable yet globally stable: once some sequences have entered the attractor, nearby points diverge from one another but never depart from the attractor.

The term &quot;strange attractor&quot; was coined by David Ruelle and Floris Takens to describe the attractor resulting from a series of bifurcations of a system describing fluid flow. Strange attractors are often differentiable in a few directions, but some are like a Cantor dust, and therefore not differentiable. Strange attractors may also be found in the presence of noise, where they may be shown to support invariant random probability measures of Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen type.

Examples of strange attractors include the double-scroll attractor, Hénon attractor, Rössler attractor, and Lorenz attractor.

==Attractors characterize the evolution of a system==

The parameters of a dynamic equation evolve as the equation is iterated, and the specific values may depend on the starting parameters. An example is the well-studied logistic map, formula_41, whose basins of attraction for various values of the parameter formula_42 are shown in the figure. If formula_43, all starting formula_11 values of formula_45 will rapidly lead to function values that go to negative infinity; starting formula_11 values of formula_47 will also go to negative infinity. But for formula_48 the formula_11 values rapidly converge to formula_50, i.e. at this value of formula_42, a single value of formula_11 is an attractor for the function&#x27;s behaviour. For other values of formula_42, more than one value of formula_11 may be visited: if formula_42 is 3.2, starting values of formula_48 will lead to function values that alternate between formula_57 and formula_58. At some values of formula_42, the attractor is a single point (a &quot;fixed point&quot;), at other values of formula_42 two values of formula_11 are visited in turn (a period-doubling bifurcation), or, as a result of further doubling, any number formula_62 values of formula_11; at yet other values of formula_42, any given number of values of formula_11 are visited in turn; finally, for some values of formula_42, an infinitude of points are visited. Thus one and the same dynamic equation can have various types of attractors, depending on its parameters.

==Basins of attraction==

An attractor&#x27;s basin of attraction is the region of the phase space, over which iterations are defined, such that any point (any initial condition) in that region will asymptotically be iterated into the attractor. For a stable linear system, every point in the phase space is in the basin of attraction. However, in nonlinear systems, some points may map directly or asymptotically to infinity, while other points may lie in a different basin of attraction and map asymptotically into a different attractor; other initial conditions may be in or map directly into a non-attracting point or cycle.

===Linear equation or system===

An univariate linear homogeneous difference equation formula_67 diverges to infinity if formula_68 from all initial points except 0; there is no attractor and therefore no basin of attraction. But if formula_69 all points on the number line map asymptotically (or directly in the case of 0) to 0; 0 is the attractor, and the entire number line is the basin of attraction.

Likewise, a linear matrix difference equation in a dynamic vector formula_70, of the homogeneous form formula_71 in terms of square matrix formula_15 will have all elements of the dynamic vector diverge to infinity if the largest eigenvalues of formula_15 is greater than 1 in absolute value; there is no attractor and no basin of attraction. But if the largest eigenvalue is less than 1 in magnitude, all initial vectors will asymptotically converge to the zero vector, which is the attractor; the entire formula_4-dimensional space of potential initial vectors is the basin of attraction.

Similar features apply to linear differential equations. The scalar equation formula_75 causes all initial values of formula_11 except zero to diverge to infinity if formula_77 but to converge to an attractor at the value 0 if formula_78, making the entire number line the basin of attraction for 0. And the matrix system formula_79 gives divergence from all initial points except the vector of zeroes if any eigenvalue of the matrix formula_15 is positive; but if all the eigenvalues are negative the vector of zeroes is an attractor whose basin of attraction is the entire phase space.

===Nonlinear equation or system===

Equations or systems that are nonlinear can give rise to a richer variety of behavior than can linear systems. One example is Newton&#x27;s method of iterating to a root of a nonlinear expression. If the expression has more than one real root, some starting points for the iterative algorithm will lead to one of the roots asymptotically, and other starting points will lead to another. The basins of attraction for the expression&#x27;s roots are generally not simple—it is not simply that the points nearest one root all map there, giving a basin of attraction consisting of nearby points. The basins of attraction can be infinite in number and arbitrarily small. For example, for the function formula_81, the following initial conditions are in successive basins of attraction:

:2.35287527 converges to 4;
:2.35284172 converges to −3;
:2.35283735 converges to 4;
:2.352836327 converges to −3;
:2.352836323 converges to 1.

Newton&#x27;s method can also be applied to complex functions to find their roots. Each root has a basin of attraction in the complex plane; these basins can be mapped as in the image shown. As can be seen, the combined basin of attraction for a particular root can have many disconnected regions. For many complex functions, the boundaries of the basins of attraction are fractals.

== Partial differential equations ==
Parabolic partial differential equations may have finite-dimensional attractors. The diffusive part of the equation damps higher frequencies and in some cases leads to a global attractor. The &quot;Ginzburg–Landau&quot;, the &quot;Kuramoto–Sivashinsky&quot;, and the two-dimensional, forced Navier–Stokes equations are all known to have global attractors of finite dimension.

For the three-dimensional, incompressible Navier–Stokes equation with periodic boundary conditions, if it has a global attractor, then this attractor will be of finite dimensions.

<text>Kangiqsualujjuaq (; ) is an Inuit village located at the mouth of the George River on the east coast of Ungava Bay in Nunavik, Quebec, Canada. Its population was 956 as of the 2021 census.

The settlement&#x27;s original name, Fort Severight, honoured John Severight, a North West Company man who had headed Fort Coulonge during McLean&#x27;s time there. After its re-establishment, it was variously known from its location as Fort George, George&#x27;s River, George River, George River Post, and Fort George River. It was also sometimes known as (French for &quot;Port New Quebec&quot;).

The name &quot;Kangiqsualujjuaq&quot; () is Inuktitut for &quot;the very large bay&quot;. It is also sometimes spelled &quot;Kangirsualujjuaq&quot; ().

==History==

John McLean established Fort Severight for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1838. It was a bit south of the present-day town, at (now marked as &quot;Illutaliviniq&quot; on topographic maps). It served as a salmon and seal fishery, supplying Fort Chimo to the west and Fort Trial and Fort Nascopie to the south. It was abandoned in 1842 after Fort Chimo turned out to be an unprofitable station and a path was found to supply Nascopie from Fort Smith to the southeast. The Inuit of the area never settled around the post, preferring to live along the coast in summer and setting their camps about inland in winter.

The site was taken up again in September 1876, mostly to capture the local indigenous peoples&#x27; trade which had been going to the Moravians. The new buildings were built from the old. The site was abandoned again in the summer of 1878 before reopening again in 1883. It again functioned as a salmon and seal fishery for Fort Chimo, although it carried on some local trading until that was removed to Port Burwell in 1917. HBC shuttered its office in June 1952.

In 1959, local Inuit established, on their own initiative, the first co-operative in Northern Quebec for the purpose of marketing Arctic char. Construction of the village began in 1962 and Inuit began to settle there permanently. In 1963 a school, a co-operative store, and government buildings were built. In 1980, Kangiqsualujjuaq was legally established as a municipality.

The community was struck by an avalanche in the early morning of January 1, 1999, which destroyed the Satuumavik School gymnasium during New Year celebrations, killing nine. Another 25 people were injured, 12 of them seriously enough to have to be airlifted to Montreal for treatment. Some speculated that it may have been triggered by lively dancing at the party. The school was rebuilt on the new, safer location and renamed to Ulluriaq School.

==Geography==
Kangiqsualujjuaq is located to the northeast of Montreal. Enveloped by mountains, the township is framed by picturesque surroundings and its elevated position affords unobstructed views of the George River. The town itself is laid out on a grid pattern over levelled-ground, with two unsealed roads leading a few kilometres beyond the mountain ridges at either end of the village. Amidst rocky outcrops and stone way-finding markers (Inukshuk), the village landscape is dotted with stands of stunted trees and prostrate groundcover that clings perilously to the rugged granite terrain. In low-lying areas, the ground is covered by thick carpets of moss and lichen.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kangiqsualujjuaq had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==

Industries in Kangiqsualujjuaq include hunting of caribou, seal and beluga whale, Arctic char fishing, and the production of Inuit art. The town is also the main terminus of the George River canoeing expeditions (e.g. one of Chewonki Foundation&#x27;s canoe trips).

==Government==
The police services are provided by the Kativik Regional Police Force. The Kativik School Board formerly operated the Ulluriaq School, previously the Satuumavik School.

==Infrastructure==
The town is served by the small Kangiqsualujjuaq Airport. Access is usually by plane, although Kangiqsualujjuamiut occasionally travel to Kuujjuaq in winter by snowmobile and in summer by boat, a journey of approximately to the southwest. Journeys across the Torngat Mountains by snowmobile to the Labrador settlements Nain and Nachvak are rarely embarked upon these days, but were commonplace when dog teams were used. Cargo ships from Becancour deliver cumbersome supplies and equipment to the community every summer.

<text>William Southcombe Lloyd Webber (11 March 1914 – 29 October 1982) was an English organist and composer, who achieved some fame as a part of the modern classical music movement whilst commercially facing mixed opportunities. Besides his long and prestigious career, composing works ranging from choral pieces to instrumental items and more, he is known for being the father of his fellow composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber. He also served as a teacher, instructing pupils in music theory at the Royal College of Music for many years until his death in 1982.

== Childhood ==

Webber was born in London. The son of William Charles Henry Webber, a self-employed plumber, he was fortunate that his father was a keen organ &#x27;&#x27; who spent what little money he had travelling to hear various organs in and around the capital. Often he would take his son with him and, before long, young William started to play the organ himself and developed a keen interest that bordered on the obsessional.

By the age of 14, William Lloyd Webber had already become a well-known organ recitalist, giving frequent performances at many churches and cathedrals throughout Great Britain. He won an organ scholarship to the Mercers&#x27; School, later winning a further scholarship to study at the Royal College of Music, where he studied with Ralph Vaughan Williams and gained his FRCO diploma at nineteen. Because there was already another student at the college with the name William Webber, William continued to use his second middle name &#x27;Lloyd&#x27; from then on as part of his last name.

==Prolific years==

Lloyd Webber&#x27;s earliest known composition is the &quot;remarkably assured&quot; &quot;Fantasy Trio&quot; in B minor for violin, cello and piano of 1936 (which didn&#x27;t receive its premiere until 1995). In 1938, he was appointed organist and head of the choir school at All Saints, Margaret Street, in the Marylebone district of London. He later became musical director at Westminster Central Hall, London, the headquarters of the Methodist church in the United Kingdom. His first compositions developed in the 1930s. In 1942 he married the pianist and violinist Jean Hermione Johnstone (1921–1993). The marriage, which lasted until his death, produced two sons:the composer Andrew (born 1948) and the cellist Julian (born 1951).

From 1945 until the 1960s Lloyd Webber composed vocal and instrumental music, choral and organ works, chamber music and orchestral works. Compositions from this period include the oratorio &quot;St. Francis of Assisi&quot; (1948), the orchestral tone-poem &quot;Aurora&quot; (1948), and the six &quot;Country Impressions&quot; (1960), each movement for a solo woodwind instrument and piano. There are also sonatinas for viola and flute, numerous songs, organ pieces and choral works. But Webber&#x27;s roots were firmly embedded in the romanticism of such composers as Sergei Rachmaninov, Jean Sibelius and César Franck, and he became increasingly convinced that his own music was &#x27;out of step&#x27; with the prevailing climate of the time. Rather than compromise his style, he turned to the academic side of British musical life. He taught at the Royal College of Music, directed the choir of Westminster Central Hall, and in 1964 was appointed Director of the London College of Music, a post which he held until his death in 1982.

<text>Mary Pope Osborne (born May 20, 1949) is an American author of children&#x27;s books and audiobook narrator. She is best known as the author of the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; series, which sold more than 134 million copies worldwide. Both the series and Osborne have won awards, including for Osborne&#x27;s charitable efforts at promoting children&#x27;s literacy. One of four children, Osborne moved around in her childhood before attending the University of North Carolina. Following college, Osborne traveled before moving to New York City. She somewhat spontaneously began to write, and her first book was published in 1982. She went on to write a variety of other children&#x27;s and young adult books before starting the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; series in 1992. Osborne&#x27;s sister Natalie Pope Boyce has written several compendium books to the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; series, sometimes with Osborne&#x27;s husband Will.

Her father&#x27;s career required the family to travel rather extensively and regularly move. As a child, Osborne lived in Salzburg, Austria, as well as Oklahoma and Virginia. Osborne herself says of the experience: &quot;Moving was never traumatic for me, but staying in one place was.” After her father retired, her family settled in a small town in North Carolina. Osborne grew invested in the local community theater, spending all her free time there.

=== College years, traveling, and early career ===
Mary Pope Osborne initially studied drama at the University of North Carolina; In her junior year, however, she switched to a major in religion with a focus on comparative religions. After graduating from UNC in 1971, Osborne and a friend went traveling. For six weeks, she camped out in a cave on the island of Crete. Following this, Osborne joined a small group of Europeans heading to the East. Their journey took Osborne through eleven countries throughout Asia, including Iraq, Iran, India, Nepal, Afghanistan, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, and Pakistan. The trip came to an end when Osborne experienced blood poisoning requiring her to stay in a hospital for a couple of weeks where she read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Remarking on her travels Osborne said, &quot;&quot;That journey irrevocably changed me. The experience was gathered that serves as a reference point every day of my life. I encountered worlds of light and worlds of darkness--and planted seeds of the imagination that led directly to my being an author of Adult&#x27;s books.&quot;

After her travels, Osborne lived in California, Washington D.C., where she met her husband Will at a theater performance, and New York, where the couple moved after getting married in 1976. During this time, she held jobs including medical assistant, travel agent, drama teacher, bartender, and as an assistant editor for a children&#x27;s magazine.

=== Life as an author ===
Mary Pope Osborne has written over 60 children&#x27;s stories, with a variety of genres and for a range of children to young adult audiences. Her books have been named to a number of the Best Books of the Year Lists, including, School Library Journal, Parents’ Magazine, The Bulletin of the Center for Children&#x27;s Books, and Bank Street College. She has received honors from such organizations as the National Council of Teachers of English, The Children&#x27;s Book Council, and the International Reading Association. She received the 1992 Diamond State Reading Association Award, 2005 Ludington Memorial Award from the Educational Paperback Association and the 2010 Heidelberger Leander Award. She has also received awards from the Carolina Alumni Association, the Virginia Library Association and in spring 2013 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Ms. Osborne served two separate terms as president of the Authors Guild and also chaired its Children&#x27;s Book Committee. She has since traveled extensively in the states and throughout the world, visiting schools and speaking on issues related to reading and books. In 2011, she attended the International Tokyo Film Festival for the premier of the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; anime film and visited schools in the tsunami-hit area of Japan. The film grossed 5.7 million dollars; Osborne donated all her proceeds into her educational works.

She was profiled on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot; for her continued efforts to get books into the hands of underserved children on a &quot;Magic Tree House&quot;-themed tour bus. She spoke of the pressure she feels as an author that children look up to, &quot;for a child to value someone who writes books is so extraordinary.&quot;

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; series in 2012, Ms. Osborne created a &quot;Magic Tree House Classroom Adventures Program&quot;. Ms. Osborne&#x27;s mission with &quot;Classroom Adventures&quot; is to inspire children to read and to love reading while simultaneously helping kids to read at grade level by the end of 3rd grade. Free of charge, the program provides a set of online educational resources for teachers and allows for Title 1 schools to apply for free &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; books. Under &quot;Classroom Adventures&quot;, Ms. Osborne, in partnership with the First Book organization in Washington, D.C., has donated hundreds of thousands of &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; books to underserved schools.

=== Writing and publication ===
Osborne&#x27;s travels and experiences have factored largely into her own writing, while her writing has allowed her to experience some of the thrills of traveling, as she said, &quot;Without even leaving my home, I’ve traveled around the globe, learning about the religions of the world.&quot;

Osborne&#x27;s writing career began &quot;one day, out of the blue&quot; when she wrote &quot;Run, Run As Fast As You Can&quot; in 1982. The book itself is semi-autobiographical in nature, according to Osborne: &quot;The girl was a lot like me and many of the incidents in the story were similar to happenings in my childhood.&quot; The book served as the starting point for Osborne&#x27;s writing career. Her early work received mixed reviews. Her work includes young adult novels, picture books, retellings of mythology and fairy tales, biographies, mysteries, a six-part series of the Odyssey, a book of American Tall Tales, and a book for young readers about the major world religions.

Osborne says that she can work on &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; up to 12 hours a day and seven days a week and has used space at shared office space, The Writer&#x27;s Room. She has modeled her writing after Hemingway by trying to be simple and direct and is &quot;noted for writing clear, lively, well-paced prose in both her stories and her informational books.&quot;

=== Family ===
Osborne was married to Will Osborne in 1976, meeting him after seeing him appear in a play. Mary has cited the key role Will plays in her writing saying, &quot;Will has given me the support and encouragement I&#x27;ve needed to be a professional daydreamer - in other words, an author of children&#x27;s books.&quot; Will and Mary also work with Mary&#x27;s sister Natalie, on the non-fiction fact trackers. Mary notes that the three of them enjoy doing book tours together. She does not have any children, which she has explained as &quot;I got too busy.&quot;

Her lakefront home features a treehouse.

== &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; series ==
Mary Pope Osborne&#x27;s most prolific work has been the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; series. The series has sold more than 134 million books worldwide since its debut in 1992 and as of 2007 the series had spent a total 132 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list. Owing to the successful sales of the books, Osborne for many years resisted efforts to commercialize the characters and books wanting them to live in the imaginations of children.

The first of the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; books, &quot;Dinosaurs Before Dark&quot;, was published in 1992. She was initially inspired to write the books while working in a teen homeless shelter and realizing that for the teens writing themselves into stories taking place in the Himalayas or Serengeti had a major effect on them. Osborne says she tried writing the book seven different ways before finding a way that worked.&quot; It introduces the main characters of Jack and Annie, a brother and sister duo of adventurers who are transported to different areas of time thanks to the titular magic treehouse. The first book established the format for future books and introduced recurring characters Morgan le Fay and Merlin, as part of the Arthurian motifs. Osborne says she is more like Jack but wishes she was more like Annie.

Osborne tends to place small cliffhangers at the end of each chapter, which has been highlighted as one of the major reasons for the appeal of the books within their target age group. Another important factor in their success is the educational nature of the series. The books are cited for their ability to interest students in history and Osborne’s usage of vocabulary encourages young readers to learn new words and for their promoting gratitude and cross-cultural understanding in its readers.

===Adaptations===

====Magic Tree House Children&#x27;s Theatre====
The &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; brand has taken on other forms. A full-scale musical adaptation was created by Will Osborne and Randy Court; &quot;Magic Tree House: The Musical&quot;, premiered in September 2007. Osborne hoped that it would have the same kind of kid and adult appeal as The Lion King or Mary Poppins. Based on the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; book &quot;Christmas in Camelot&quot;, the Musical has toured nationally and had a cast album.

A planetarium show; &quot;Magic Tree House: Space Mission&quot;, also created by Will Osborne, is produced and presented exclusively at the Morehead Planetarium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

In 2011, Will Osborne collaborated with New Orleans composer Allen Toussaint and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&quot;&#x27; co-creator Murray Horwitz to write &quot;A Night in New Orleans&quot;, a musical adaptation of &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; #42: &quot;A Good Night for Ghosts&quot; about the life of Louis Armstrong. The show features an ensemble cast and live jazz band. It premiered in 2012 at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and was shown free to every Newark 4th grade student.

&quot;Magic Tree House Kids Shows&quot; are theatrical adaptations of selected titles in the &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; series designed specifically for performance by kids. To date, children&#x27;s shows have been created by husband and wife playwright and composer team Randy Courts and Jenny Laird in collaboration with Will Osborne based on the following &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; books: &quot;Dinosaurs Before Dark&quot;, &quot;The Knight at Dawn&quot;, &quot;Pirates Past Noon&quot;, &quot;A Ghost Tale for Christmas Time&quot;, &quot;A Night in New Orleans&quot;, and &quot;Stage Fright on a Summer Night&quot;, a new children&#x27;s show based on the life of William Shakespeare premiered at the Orlando Shakespeare Theatre in October 2017.

====Film adaptation====
In 2011, the series was adapted as a Japanese animated fantasy film, . The film was directed by Hiroshi Nishikiori and the screenplay was based on the Japanese version of the novel series &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; by Ichiro Okouchi.

In 2016, Lionsgate acquired the film rights with a script by Will Osborne and Jenny Laird. The film would primarily contain plot elements from Book #29, &quot;Christmas in Camelot&quot;. As of 2021 no further news about this movie has been reported.

<doc id="191101" wikidata="Q62542" url="?curid=191101" title="Phase space">
<text>The phase space of a physical system is the set of all possible physical states of the system when described by a given parameterization. Each possible state corresponds uniquely to a point in the phase space. For mechanical systems, the phase space usually consists of all possible values of the position and momentum parameters. It is the direct product of direct space and reciprocal space. The concept of phase space was developed in the late 19th century by Ludwig Boltzmann, Henri Poincaré, and Josiah Willard Gibbs.

== Principles ==
In a phase space, every degree of freedom or parameter of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space; a one-dimensional system is called a phase line, while a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane. For every possible state of the system or allowed combination of values of the system&#x27;s parameters, a point is included in the multidimensional space. The system&#x27;s evolving state over time traces a path (a phase-space trajectory for the system) through the high-dimensional space. The phase-space trajectory represents the set of states compatible with starting from one particular initial condition, located in the full phase space that represents the set of states compatible with starting from &quot;any&quot; initial condition. As a whole, the phase diagram represents all that the system can be, and its shape can easily elucidate qualities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise. A phase space may contain a great number of dimensions. For instance, a gas containing many molecules may require a separate dimension for each particle&#x27;s &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; positions and momenta (6 dimensions for an idealized monatomic gas), and for more complex molecular systems additional dimensions are required to describe vibrational modes of the molecular bonds, as well as spin around 3 axes. Phase spaces are easier to use when analyzing the behavior of mechanical systems restricted to motion around and along various axes of rotation or translation e.g. in robotics, like analyzing the range of motion of a robotic arm or determining the optimal path to achieve a particular position/momentum result.

=== Conjugate momenta ===

In classical mechanics, any choice of generalized coordinates &quot;q&quot;&quot;i&quot; for the position (i.e. coordinates on configuration space) defines conjugate generalized momenta &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, which together define co-ordinates on phase space. More abstractly, in classical mechanics phase space is the cotangent bundle of configuration space, and in this interpretation the procedure above expresses that a choice of local coordinates on configuration space induces a choice of natural local Darboux coordinates for the standard symplectic structure on a cotangent space.

=== Statistical ensembles in phase space ===
The motion of an ensemble of systems in this space is studied by classical statistical mechanics. The local density of points in such systems obeys Liouville&#x27;s theorem, and so can be taken as constant. Within the context of a model system in classical mechanics, the phase-space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system&#x27;s dynamic variables. Because of this, it is possible to calculate the state of the system at any given time in the future or the past, through integration of Hamilton&#x27;s or Lagrange&#x27;s equations of motion.

== In low dimensions ==
For simple systems, there may be as few as one or two degrees of freedom. One degree of freedom occurs when one has an autonomous ordinary differential equation in a single variable, formula_1 with the resulting one-dimensional system being called a phase line, and the qualitative behaviour of the system being immediately visible from the phase line. The simplest non-trivial examples are the exponential growth model/decay (one unstable/stable equilibrium) and the logistic growth model (two equilibria, one stable, one unstable).

The phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane, which occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension, and where the two variables are position and velocity. In this case, a sketch of the phase portrait may give qualitative information about the dynamics of the system, such as the limit cycle of the Van der Pol oscillator shown in the diagram.

Here the horizontal axis gives the position, and vertical axis the velocity. As the system evolves, its state follows one of the lines (trajectories) on the phase diagram.
== Related concepts ==

=== Phase plot ===
A plot of position and momentum variables as a function of time is sometimes called a phase plot or a phase diagram. However the latter expression, &quot;phase diagram&quot;, is more usually reserved in the physical sciences for a diagram showing the various regions of stability of the thermodynamic phases of a chemical system, which consists of pressure, temperature, and composition.

== Phase portrait ==
=== Phase integral ===
In classical statistical mechanics (continuous energies) the concept of phase space provides a classical analog to the partition function (sum over states) known as the phase integral. Instead of summing the Boltzmann factor over discretely spaced energy states (defined by appropriate integer quantum numbers for each degree of freedom), one may integrate over continuous phase space. Such integration essentially consists of two parts: integration of the momentum component of all degrees of freedom (momentum space) and integration of the position component of all degrees of freedom (configuration space). Once the phase integral is known, it may be related to the classical partition function by multiplication of a normalization constant representing the number of quantum energy states per unit phase space. This normalization constant is simply the inverse of the Planck constant raised to a power equal to the number of degrees of freedom for the system.

== Applications ==

=== Chaos theory ===
Classic examples of phase diagrams from chaos theory are:
* the Lorenz attractor
* population growth (i.e. logistic map)
* parameter plane of complex quadratic polynomials with Mandelbrot set.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
In quantum mechanics, the coordinates &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; of phase space normally become Hermitian operators in a Hilbert space.

But they may alternatively retain their classical interpretation, provided functions of them compose in novel algebraic ways (through Groenewold&#x27;s 1946 star product). This is consistent with the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. 
Every quantum mechanical observable corresponds to a unique function or distribution on phase space, and conversely, as specified by Hermann Weyl (1927) and supplemented by John von Neumann (1931); Eugene Wigner (1932); and, in a grand synthesis, by H. J. Groenewold (1946). 
With J. E. Moyal (1949), these completed the foundations of the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics, a complete and logically autonomous reformulation of quantum mechanics. (Its modern abstractions include deformation quantization and geometric quantization.)
Expectation values in phase-space quantization are obtained isomorphically to tracing operator observables with the density matrix in Hilbert space: they are obtained by phase-space integrals of observables, with the Wigner quasi-probability distribution effectively serving as a measure.

Thus, by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space (the same ambit as for classical mechanics), the Weyl map facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics as a deformation (generalization) of classical mechanics, with deformation parameter &quot;ħ&quot;/&quot;S&quot;, where &quot;S&quot; is the action of the relevant process. (Other familiar deformations in physics involve the deformation of classical Newtonian into relativistic mechanics, with deformation parameter &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot;; or the deformation of Newtonian gravity into general relativity, with deformation parameter Schwarzschild radius/characteristic dimension.)

Classical expressions, observables, and operations (such as Poisson brackets) are modified by &quot;ħ&quot;-dependent quantum corrections, as the conventional commutative multiplication applying in classical mechanics is generalized to the noncommutative star-multiplication characterizing quantum mechanics and underlying its uncertainty principle.

=== Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics ===

In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics contexts, the term &quot;phase space&quot; has two meanings: for one, it is used in the same sense as in classical mechanics. If a thermodynamic system consists of &quot;N&quot; particles, then a point in the 6&quot;N&quot;-dimensional phase space describes the dynamic state of every particle in that system, as each particle is associated with 3 position variables and 3 momentum variables. In this sense, as long as the particles are distinguishable, a point in phase space is said to be a microstate of the system. (For indistinguishable particles a microstate consists of a set of &quot;N&quot;! points, corresponding to all possible exchanges of the &quot;N&quot; particles.) &quot;N&quot; is typically on the order of the Avogadro number, thus describing the system at a microscopic level is often impractical. This leads to the use of phase space in a different sense.

The phase space can also refer to the space that is parameterized by the &quot;macroscopic&quot; states of the system, such as pressure, temperature, etc. For instance, one may view the pressure–volume diagram or temperature–entropy diagram as describing part of this phase space. A point in this phase space is correspondingly called a macrostate. There may easily be more than one microstate with the same macrostate. For example, for a fixed temperature, the system could have many dynamic configurations at the microscopic level. When used in this sense, a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in, for example, the liquid phase, or solid phase, etc.

Since there are many more microstates than macrostates, the phase space in the first sense is usually a manifold of much larger dimensions than in the second sense. Clearly, many more parameters are required to register every detail of the system down to the molecular or atomic scale than to simply specify, say, the temperature or the pressure of the system.

=== Optics ===
Phase space is extensively used in nonimaging optics, the branch of optics devoted to illumination. It is also an important concept in Hamiltonian optics.

=== Medicine ===
In medicine and bioengineering, the phase space method is used to visualize multidimensional physiological responses.

<doc id="191103" wikidata="Q1247463" url="?curid=191103" title="Emergency!">
<text>Emergency! is an American action-adventure medical drama television series jointly produced by Mark VII Limited and Universal Television. Debuting on NBC as a midseason replacement on January 15, 1972, replacing two situation comedy series, &quot;The Partners&quot; and &quot;The Good Life&quot;, it ran for a total of 122 episodes until May 28, 1977, with six additional two-hour television films in 1978 and 1979.

The series stars Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe as two rescuers, who work as paramedics and firefighters in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The duo formed Squad 51, a medical and rescue unit of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, working together with the fictional Rampart General Hospital medical staff (portrayed by Robert Fuller, Julie London and Bobby Troup), and with the firefighter engine company at Station 51.

&quot;Emergency!&quot; was produced by Jack Webb and created by Robert A. Cinader, who had also created the police dramas &quot;Adam-12&quot; and &quot;Dragnet&quot;. Harold Jack Bloom is also credited as a creator; Webb does not receive screen credit as a creator. In the show&#x27;s original TV-movie pilot, Webb was credited only as its director. However, the series aimed to be much more realistic than its predecessors as it portrayed emergency medical services (EMS). Pioneering EMS leader James O. Page served as a technical advisor, and the two main actors underwent some paramedic training.

The series aired at a time when ambulance coverage in the United States was rapidly expanding and changing, and the role of a paramedic was emerging as a profession, and is credited with popularizing the concepts of EMS and paramedics in American society, and even inspiring other states and municipalities to expand the service.

Nearly 30 years after &quot;Emergency!&quot; debuted, the Smithsonian Institution accepted &quot;Emergency!&quot; memorabilia into its National Museum of American History&#x27;s public-service section, including the firefighters&#x27; helmets, turnouts, Biophone, and defibrillator. The vehicles of Station 51 are a part of the collection of the Los Angeles County Fire Museum.

== Cast ==

Set at the fictional Fire Station 51 of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, where one fire engine and the paramedic rescue squad are stationed, the series focuses on two young firefighter-paramedics: young and immature John Roderick &quot;Johnny&quot; Gage (Randolph Mantooth), who is always unlucky in love, and more mature family man Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe), who crew the rescue squad, Squad 51, and, in addition to providing emergency medical care, perform technical rescues such as vehicle extrication.

The paramedics are supervised by the emergency room (ER) staff of Rampart General Hospital: head physician Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller), head nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London), neurosurgeon Dr. Joe Early (played by London&#x27;s real-life husband Bobby Troup), and young intern Dr. Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Morton (Ron Pinkard, though in the early episodes was a character named Dr. Thomas Gray).

Other regular characters are the firefighters of Station 51&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; shift, Chester B. &quot;Chet&quot; Kelly (played by Tim Donnelly) and Marco Lopez (played by actor Marco Lopez). Mike Stoker, a Los Angeles County Fire Department firefighter specialist, drove Engine 51. Los Angeles County Fire Department Dispatcher Samuel Lanier portrayed himself in an uncredited voice role (over the radio) throughout the series, and he is also occasionally shown in a brief clip at the dispatch office just before a dispatch is heard in later seasons; he retired from the department shortly after &quot;Emergency!&quot; finished. Lopez speaks Spanish, and occasionally translated for the crew when a victim or onlooker spoke Spanish but no English. Unusually, Lopez, Stoker and Dick Hammer play characters named after themselves, though in two episodes, Hammer&#x27;s character is played by John Smith.

Various characters held the rank of Captain throughout the series. These include Captain Dick Hammer (Los Angeles County Fire Department Captain Richard Hammer as himself for first season/episodes 1–9, then later John Smith for the last two episodes of the season), Captain Hank Stanley (Michael Norell, during the remaining seasons) and Captain Gene &quot;Captain Hook&quot; Hookrader in a couple of later episodes. Actor John Anderson portrayed Captain Bob Roberts in one Season 4 episode, &quot;Smoke Eater&quot;.

Other recurring characters include Battalion Chiefs Conrad (Art Balinger), Sorensen (Art Gilmore), Miller, and McConnike (William Boyett), Firefighter Conway / Firefighter Paramedic Tom Wheeler / Animal Control Supervisor Walt Marsh (Gary Crosby), Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy/Carson Police Officer/Sergeant Vince (Vince Howard), and recurring ambulance attendants Albert &quot;Al&quot; (Angelo DeMeo) and his assistant, George (George Orrison). Boyett and Crosby regularly appeared as Sergeant MacDonald and Officer Ed Wells respectively on &quot;Adam-12&quot;, while Gilmore appeared on that show as watch commander Lieutenant Moore, a recurring character.

The role of Dixie McCall was originally written as a love interest for Fuller&#x27;s character, Dr. Kelly Brackett, though the on-screen romance between Brackett and McCall was gradually downplayed and eventually ignored over the course of the series; this was explained by Brackett&#x27;s and McCall&#x27;s romance not having worked out.

== Development ==
The series was created by Robert Cinader and Jack Webb. Webb had previously created &quot;Dragnet&quot;, and with Cinader had jointly created &quot;Adam-12&quot;, both of which were TV series about policing. In 1971, Cinader and Webb met with Captain Jim Page and other officers from the Los Angeles County Fire Department to discuss creating a show about firefighters. Initially they planned to focus the show on physical rescues, but felt that there would not be enough ideas for episodes. Page suggested they look to the Los Angeles County Fire Department&#x27;s new paramedic program for ideas.

At the time, the Los Angeles area was home to 2 of only 12 paramedic programs in the United States (as opposed to ambulances that provided basic first aid or only transport). In 1970, Governor Ronald Reagan had signed the Wedworth-Townsend Act which allowed paramedic programs to be trialed in Los Angeles County. In September 1971, Cinader and Webb signed a contract with NBC to develop the series. The initial pilot film of &quot;Emergency!&quot;, titled &quot;The Wedsworth-Townsend Act&quot;, focuses on the passage of a similar law to the Wedworth-Townsend Act that permits paramedics to operate.

Cinader asked the writers to get all the rescues that were to be portrayed on the show from fire stations&#x27; logbooks. Along the same line, the series was technically accurate as every script was fact-checked and approved by the series&#x27; technical consultants, Dr. Michael Criley (the man who had initially created the Los Angeles County Fire Department Paramedic program) and Los Angeles County Fire Department Battalion Chief James O. Page. There were always real paramedics serving as technical advisors on set every day for further technical advice.

To train for their parts, the actors, Mantooth and Tighe sat in some paramedic classes (although they never actually took any written exams) and went on extensive ride-alongs with Los Angeles County Fire Department. In an interview with Tom Blixa of WTVN, Mantooth said that the producer wanted them to train so that they would at least know the fundamentals and look like they knew what they were doing on camera. Mantooth mentioned that you needed to take the entire course and pass all the skills stations and final certification exam to be a paramedic, and went on to admit that &quot;if anyone has a heart attack, I&#x27;ll call 911 with the best of them.&quot; Mantooth became an advocate for firefighters and paramedics after the series ended. He continued, as of late October 2014, to give speeches and make appearances all over the country at special events.

==Episodes==

==Setting==
Interior scenes were shot on Universal&#x27;s sound stages. Exterior scenes of the fire station were shot at Station 127 in Carson, while exterior scenes of the hospital were shot at Harbor General Hospital (now Harbor-UCLA Medical Center).

=== Station 51 ===

Station 51 was represented by Los Angeles Fire Station 127, located at 2049 East 223rd Street (between Wilmington Avenue and Alameda Street, with the San Diego Freeway (I-405) visible in the background in wide shots) in Carson, California.

At the time the series aired, the Los Angeles County Fire Department had no Station 51. It was the number of a station that had previously existed at the intersection of Arlington and Atlantic Avenues on the outskirts of Lynwood and Compton, and closed in the late 1960s when the area was annexed by Lynwood. Since 1994, the Los Angeles County Fire Department has had a Station 51 in a different location. In an homage to the show, the fire station on the grounds of Universal Studios was renumbered from Station 60 to Station 51, more than 20 years after the debut of &quot;Emergency!&quot;. The vehicles based at Station 60 were accordingly renumbered. This station is therefore home to an actual Engine 51 and Squad 51, as well as Patrol 51 and Quint 51 (a ladder truck with ground ladders, fire pump, water tank and hose).

Station 127 was chosen by series co-creator Robert A. Cinader, and the station was eventually named in his honor (a plaque honoring Robert A. Cinader is now mounted on the station next to the office front door). Station 106 in Rolling Hills Estates, California, a similar design to 127, was initially the choice, but faced north (versus south), which would make it difficult to light properly. At the time of filming Station 127 housed Engine 127 and Truck 127 (a ladder truck), whereas the fictional Station 51 had a small rescue truck instead of a ladder truck. As of 2018, Station 127 now instead houses Quint 127 and Foam 127.

When filming on location took place, Truck 127 was moved off-site and replaced with Universal&#x27;s Squad 51, while Engine 127 was disguised as Engine 51. After Universal obtained a 1973 Ward LaFrance to use as Engine 51, both of Station 127&#x27;s apparatus would be replaced by Universal&#x27;s Engine 51 and Squad 51 for filming on location. Despite being &quot;kicked out&quot; of their own station for filming, Truck 127 still appeared in numerous episodes under its own callsign. The Carson location of Station 127 was directly referenced in one episode where a phone call was traced to a house &quot;in Carson&quot; that Engine 51 and Squad 51 eventually responded to. Interior scenes at Station 51 were filmed on sets at the studio, which accurately recreated the interior of Station 127.

&quot;KMG365&quot;, which is said by the crewmember acknowledging a call for a unit at Station 51, is a real FCC call sign used by Los Angeles County Fire Department assigned to Fire Station 98 in Bellflower, and it appears on the Station Patch for Station 127.

=== Rampart General Hospital ===
In the pilot episode, Rampart General Hospital is shown (in a letter to Dr. Brackett) to be located in Carson, California. At the time of filming, Rampart General Hospital was represented by Harbor General Hospital, located in Torrance, California at 1000 West Carson Street, the intersection of Vermont Avenue and Carson Street (). The pairing of Station 127 and Harbor General as &quot;Station 51&quot; and &quot;Rampart&quot; was accurate, since if a squad had actually been quartered at Station 127, it would likely have operated from Harbor General Hospital, since they are only 2.1 miles (3.4 km) apart. Not accurate was the response area of Station 51. Many examples exist. As seen in season 6 episode 5, where they responded to 4000 N. Riverton Ave. Universal City, Truck 127 appeared in one episode where a rescue event occurred at Rampart (Harbor General), as the hospital really is in Truck 127&#x27;s &quot;first-due&quot; district.

In an episode near the end of the series, one character, an aged jazz musician, hearing the name Rampart General, says, &quot;My grandaddy used to play on Rampart Street in New Orleans!&quot; The name Rampart actually comes from the show &quot;Adam-12&quot; and is the real name of a division of the LAPD.

In 1978, by the approval of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Harbor General Hospital was renamed as Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.

In 2018, CrowdRx, Inc., launched their Mobile Emergency Room Trailer, naming it &quot;Rampart&quot; to honor Rampart General Hospital.


=== Los Angeles County Fire Dispatch ===
Footage of a dispatcher used during the show appears to have been filmed at the Los Angeles County Fire Department Keith E. Klinger dispatch center in East Los Angeles. The screen he looked at to see the street maps is a rear projection from a Kodak Carousel projector built into the console. The man was actual Los Angeles County Fire Department dispatcher Sam Lanier, who also lent his voice as the dispatcher for the series&#x27; entire run.

The familiar tones that called Station 51 into service were initiated by dispatch using a Motorola Quik Call I unit, a radio listening on a common paging frequency for a pair of special audio tones assigned to that station. For a large incident, one could often hear many sets of tones calling many stations, but only a specific pair would sound the buzzer for Station 51.

A long scene showing the sequence of microfiche reader address lookup to quik-call dispatch appears in the season six episode &quot;Family Ties&quot;.

==Props==

The creators of &quot;Emergency!&quot; tried to accurately portray the Los Angeles County Fire Department by using apparatus and equipment in current use. The extensive cooperation of the Los Angeles County Fire Department is repeatedly apparent in the program. Although a few key items were fictionalized, such as the identification of Station 51 and its equipment, many of the locations and apparatus reflected the operating reality of locations used in some filming. Nearly 30 years after &quot;Emergency!&quot; debuted, the Smithsonian Institution accepted &quot;Emergency!&quot; memorabilia into its National History Museum, public-service section, including their helmets, turnouts, Biophone, and defibrillator.

===Squad 51===

The vehicles which represented Squad 51 were constructed by Universal crews and were accurate replicas of the units built in-house on stock 1970 Dodge D300 truck chassis by Los Angeles County Fire Department prior to the filming of &quot;Emergency&quot;. There were three identical truck chassis&#x27; used to represent the original TV Squad 51. The Los Angeles County Fire Department shops were unable to fulfill a request from Universal to build the first unit for the show within the short deadline the studio required, but did provide the blueprints so the studio could build its own unit on a 1972 Dodge D300 chassis.

The replica&#x27;s accuracy is evident in that the white light atop the Federal Signal Twinsonic lightbar was part of the blueprint, but never installed by Los Angeles County Fire Department on its departmental units. This light was intended to be used by other personnel and particularly helicopters to differentiate paramedic squads from regular rescue squads and other units operating that vehicle type. Prior to season 3, the studio acquired a 1973 D300 cab and chassis. All of the external paraphernalia (rear compartment box, lightbar, searchlights, K12 box, etc.) were removed and remounted on the new squad chassis. This vehicle lasted for two seasons. In season 5 the third and final Dodge truck appeared. It was a 1974 model and this is the vehicle that presently resides in the Los Angeles County Fire Department museum. Once again, the rear compartment box and lightbar from the original Squad 51 were remounted. Also, the last two chassis came with a different engine grille, so the parts from the first truck were kept. The whereabouts of the first two stripped-down Dodge D300s remains a mystery. After the filming of the series, at the Fire Department&#x27;s request, the studio donated the unit to Los Angeles County Fire Department in 1978, which pressed it into occasional service as a reserve unit before it was eventually retired from service.

In 1999, Los Angeles County Fire Department donated the Universal-built squad to the Los Angeles County Fire Museum, which restored it and put it on display.

=== Engine 51 ===

The original Engine 51 was a 1965 open-cab Crown Firecoach, and was represented by Los Angeles County Fire Department Engine 127&#x27;s 1965 Crown in stock footage at the fire station (in reality Los Angeles County Fire Department Station 127), and by Los Angeles County Fire Department Engine 60&#x27;s 1965 Crown (the unit assigned to Universal Studios) for filming on the grounds of the studio. In a few instances in the first and second seasons, the regular apparatus borrowed from Los Angeles County Fire Department and used for filming appear to have been unavailable as some scenes show a slightly different vintage Crown Firecoach pumper, most evident by the different style of emergency lights on the cab&#x27;s roof. As a condition of providing a Dept pumper for filming the Los Angeles County Fire Department required one of its own qualified Engineers be used to operate it, active Firefighter Engineer (later Specialist) Mike Stoker, who already possessed a Screen Actors Guild card, was cast in the series. The mixing of stock station and response footage with footage filmed for specific storylines created continuity errors by mixing these apparatus.

Early in the third season, Engine 51 was represented by a 1973 closed-cab Ward LaFrance P80 Ambassador triple-combination pumper. Los Angeles County Fire Department was purchasing numerous P80s at the time, and Ward LaFrance, through their local distributor, Albro Fire Equipment Co. of Los Angeles, donated a P80 unit to Universal Studios specifically for use in the series as product placement. The Ward LaFrance Engine 51 was thus not a disguised unit and did not require the use of Los Angeles County Fire Department resources for filming.

Engine 127&#x27;s 1965 Crown, one of the two originally used for the series, was later refitted with a closed cab. Eventually it was placed into reserve status when Station 127 received a new engine. In its reserve capacity, it was serving temporarily as Engine 95 when it was involved in a collision. Damaged beyond repair in the collision, it was salvaged for parts and sold as scrap. The County of Los Angeles Fire Museum Association now owns and has restored the 1965 Crown which formerly served as Engine 60 at Universal Studios and appeared most often as the Crown version of Engine 51.

The Ward LaFrance P80 Ambassador that represented Engine 51, owned by the studio outright, made its final &quot;Emergency!&quot; appearance in the movie &quot;The Steel Inferno,&quot; but it was marked as Engine 110. The Ward remained at Universal Studios as a prop following the conclusion of the series, and made brief appearances such as in the film &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; (1979) and a short educational film produced by the National Fire Protection Association in 1984. Eventually, the Ward was pressed into active duty at Yosemite National Park, as MCA Recreation Services (Universal&#x27;s then-owner/operator) was under contract to provide visitor services at the park at the time, and it remained with YNP Fire after MCARS&#x27;s involvement at the Park ended.

As the fire department for the concession area was private (and not state or federal), the engine had the California personalized (vanity) license plate YCS E51. It served continuously as YNP Fire&#x27;s Engine 7 until it was retired and replaced in July 2008. Per terms of a previous agreement between the Park and the County of Los Angeles Fire Museum Association, the museum assumed ownership of the Ward and added it to the museum collection. In 2012, the museum finished a complete restoration of the Ward to its original appearance in the show.

Both of Station 51&#x27;s vehicles have also been immortalized as &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; diecast vehicles &quot;Emergency Squad&quot; (1998) and &quot;Fire-Eater&quot; (1977) respectively.

===Antique Dennis fire engine===
An antique fire engine was the subject of three episodes of the show. In the third season, episode 2, entitled, &quot;The Old Engine&quot;, Gage and DeSoto see a derelict fire engine in a scrap yard during a fire. They purchase the vehicle for $80 according to the script and attempt to restore it. The script says it is a 1932 Dennis fire engine, but the vehicle is a Dennis Ace model, manufactured from 1934 to 1939 and sold to the British market, including Australia, New Zealand, and India. Records indicate this model was not sold in the US.

In Season 4, Episode 13, &quot;The Parade&quot;, the two paramedics have finished their restoration of the Dennis Ace fire engine for the California Firefighters Parade, though having to replace a part that just busted. En route to the parade, wearing antique uniforms, the two spot an apartment fire and respond in the engine using its antiquated equipment to rescue two people trapped in the building before Los Angeles County Fire Department arrives. The Dennis Ace is heavily damaged when the structure collapses onto it. In Season 5, Episode 2, &quot;The Old Engine Cram&quot; the main characters are informed by Nurse McCall that a man is looking to buy that same model of fire engine. Unfortunately, the engine is mistakenly referred to in the script as a 1923 Paige when it is actually a Dennis.

=== Equipment ===

The orange radio Gage and DeSoto used was a model 3502 Biocom Biophone. It came in an orange fiberglass case and was fully portable. It could transmit EKG and voice, could be charged in 15 minutes, and had one hour of talking time. The radio had eight duplex UHF channels and a total of 12 watts of transmitting power. There were two Biophones used on the series, one smaller than the other.

In &quot;Survival on Charter #220&quot;, Gage and DeSoto are briefly seen using a Motorola Apcor, with Dr. Early and Nurse McCall using a Motorola base station back at Rampart.
The electrocardiograph (ECG or EKG) machine used in the show was a Datascope Model 850 Dual Trace Physiological Monitor. This model came out in 1971 and was the first portable, battery rechargeable unit of its kind. Its original price was $2,000. In the middle of Season 4, the show switched to a Datascope MD/2, which was a combined monitor and defibrillator that allowed the monitor unit to slide out. With the monitor docked, it can read and display an EKG through the defibrillator paddles; this function is shown several times during the series, and anticipates the development of the automated external defibrillator, only a few years later. The paramedics also carried some medical equipment in a black model PF-3300 Old Pal tackle box, commonly used by the fire department at the time. There were instances when the actors encountered difficulty in pronouncing medical terms correctly, so some scenes show the characters from the back or behind a mask, which allowed them to dub in the correct pronunciations at a later time.

Many items of the equipment were donated to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History in May 2000.

The protective clothing (&quot;turn-out gear&quot;) that the firefighters wore, including the MSA Topgard helmets, as well as nearly all other equipment such as insignia, were standard fire department issue at the time.

The badges used in the series were authentic fire department badges. At the end of filming each day, they were collected, stored for safekeeping and then reissued the next day.

==Legacy==
===Impact on emergency medical services===
Prior to &quot;Emergency!&quot;, ambulances had been operating for decades in the United States. However, their crews rarely had training beyond basic first aid. Most states did not license them to perform more advanced medical treatment. The alternative was to staff ambulances with traditional healthcare professionals like doctors, which was expensive and posed recruitment challenges.

Writing in the &quot;University of Baltimore Law Review&quot; in 2007, Paul Bergman argued that &quot;Emergency!&quot; encouraged the growth of EMS. The conclusion is shared by Yokey and Sutherland in the book &quot;Emergency! Behind the Scenes&quot;. Bergman acknowledges that some of this trend had already been in motion, due to developments such as the 1966 report &quot;Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society&quot; and California&#x27;s Wedworth-Townsend Act in 1970. In 1971, there were only 12 paramedic services operating in the United States. In the first three years that &quot;Emergency!&quot; aired, 46 out of 50 states enacted laws that allowed paramedics to practice. On a federal level, the 1974 Emergency Medical Services Systems Act was enacted to encourage the trend. By 1982, half of the American population was within ten minutes&#x27; reach of a paramedic unit.

The show was referenced during a debate in the Health Committee of the California State Assembly, during the passage of a bill to make the Wedworth-Townsend Act permanent. A 1977 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article wrote that &quot;[t]he television series &quot;Emergency!&quot; helped create a national demand for such services.&quot; In a 1993 paper, Byron K. Toma argued that it &quot;helped convince the public that they are entitled to the highest levels of emergency medical aid technologically available.&quot;

In episode 17 of season 3, &quot;Fools&quot;, singer Bobby Sherman plays an arrogant intern who shows disdain for John and Roy ... until he is sent out with them by Dr. Brackett to see exactly what they do. Sherman&#x27;s character changes his mind quickly upon watching them perform a harrowing rescue. In real life, Sherman would leave show business and become an EMT. He worked with paramedics and taught CPR and first aid and subsequently joined the Los Angeles Police Department Reserve Officer Program. He served as a training officer for many years and would be promoted to the rank of Captain; Sherman credited his role on that episode of &quot;Emergency!&quot; as a guiding force in his choice of career change.

=== Spin-offs and crossovers ===
&quot;Emergency!&quot; was a third-generation spin-off, having been spawned from Jack Webb&#x27;s &quot;Adam-12&quot;, which itself was spun off from Jack Webb&#x27;s &quot;Dragnet&quot;. All three series take place in the same universe and depict different aspects of the public safety infrastructure of Los Angeles, California.

Characters from &quot;Emergency!&quot; and &quot;Adam-12&quot; &quot;crossed over&quot; twice. The police officers appeared briefly in the pilot episode of &quot;Emergency!&quot;, and the firefighter/paramedics appeared in the &quot;Adam-12&quot; episode titled &quot;Lost and Found&quot;. Unusually, in the &quot;Emergency!&quot; episode titled &quot;Hang-Up&quot;, there was a subplot in which the crew of Station 51 watched the television show &quot;Adam-12&quot;, despite sharing a fictional universe with those characters.

&quot;Emergency!&quot; spun off an animated version called &quot;Emergency +4&quot; which ran on NBC Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1976, and featured four youngsters and their three pets who participated in rescue adventures with firefighter/paramedics DeSoto and Gage.

Mantooth&#x27;s Gage and Tighe&#x27;s DeSoto appeared in the tenth episode of &quot;Sierra&quot;, another Webb/Cinader production about a pair of National Park Service rangers, which appeared for only a partial season in 1974. In that episode, &quot;The Urban Ranger&quot;, the two paramedics participate in mountain rescue training and get involved in many of the episode&#x27;s subplots. Following recurring themes from &quot;Emergency!&quot;, Gage continues to fail in his attempts to get a date, while DeSoto briefly considers changing careers to become a park ranger.

The &quot;905-Wild&quot; episode of &quot;Emergency!&quot;, broadcast during the closing of its Season 4 on Saturday March 1, 1975, was intended to be the pilot for a new series created and produced by Jack Webb. The series was to have been about the adventures of two Los Angeles County Department of Animal Control officers, and the staff of a county animal shelter. The episode featured Albert Popwell and Mark Harmon as the officers and David Huddleston and Gary Crosby in supporting roles. However, it failed to sell and the follow-up series was never produced.

Squad 51 briefly appeared in the &quot;CHiPs&quot; episode &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; (season 1, ep. 18), where it can be seen responding from the station to a false accident report. Further in the episode &quot;MAIT Team&quot; (season 2, ep. 15), Engine 51 and Squad 51 can be seen responding from the station to a traffic accident. Again in the episode &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; (season 3, ep. 8) Squad 51 arrives on the scene of a traffic accident. It has a major role in the episode &quot;E.M.T&quot; when it responds to aid a young boy trapped in his clubhouse under a busy freeway, where California Highway Patrol officers Ponch and Jon retrieve equipment from the squad to aid in the rescue of the boy.

The episode &quot;Cover Up&quot; of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; featured a paramedic team from Squad 44 contacting Rampart General Hospital while tending a heart attack patient, although the patient is directed to a closer hospital. When Dr. Quincy later visits Station 44 to question the paramedics concerning the patient&#x27;s death, stock footage of the exterior of Station 51 is used. This episode was written by R.A. Cinader. Earlier, in the season 1 episode &quot;Has Anyone Seen Quincy?&quot; Harbor General Hospital is used as the filming location of the unnamed hospital seen throughout the episode. Rampart is again contacted in season 7&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Hour&quot;, but the patient is directed to a closer hospital, and Engine 51 responds to a hotel fire in the same season&#x27;s episode &quot;Smoke Screen&quot;.

Station 51 appears in the TV movie &quot;The Great Los Angeles Earthquake&quot; (1990), in a segment where all Los Angeles police and fire personnel are deployed to prepare for a massive Southern California earthquake. Stock footage from &quot;Emergency!&quot; is used.

Rampart Hospital is briefly mentioned in the &quot;9-1-1&quot; episode &quot;Hen Begins&quot; (season 2, ep. 9), where Hen is introduced to fellow peers who are struggling to fit into their roles (Edit: The Rampart mentioned is not the fictional hospital, but the real-life LAPD station.)

=== TV movies ===
From 1978 through 1979, the show returned as a series of &quot;Movies of the Week&quot;. The TV movies premiered in this order:

&quot;The Steel Inferno&quot;: A fire breaks out in a skyscraper and the members of Squad 51 along with other Los Angeles County Fire Department members from Station #110 help rescue those who are trapped. Personnel from Rampart General Hospital set up a triage area at the scene to care for the injured awaiting to be transported to the hospital. A Coast Guard helicopter helps firefighters with rooftop evacuations. One conflict of the episode is Squad 110&#x27;s paramedic attempting to save his missing fiancé. This television movie was similar to Irwin Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974).

&quot;Survival on Charter #220&quot;: While Squad 51 is on a call, two planes collide with one crash landing in a Los Angeles subdivision, trapping Gage and DeSoto. A resident of the subdivision which was the site of the crash was the girlfriend of one of Squad 51&#x27;s other paramedics from another shift. The on and off-duty firefighters make multiple rescues to save survivors. During the event, however, one of the engines from the plane lands on the squad, destroying it.

&quot;Most Deadly Passage&quot;: The paramedics from Squad 51 travel to Seattle to watch how their paramedics of the Seattle Fire Department Medic One Program treat patients and respond to calls for help. The most notable incident in the movie is the ferry that catches fire in the middle of a trip due to a fueling error.

&quot;What&#x27;s a Nice Girl Like You Doing?&quot;: Gage and DeSoto travel to San Francisco to observe some female paramedics work as well as the rescue crew of the San Francisco Fire Department. A worker is rescued from the Golden Gate Bridge, an ambulance gets into an accident that ends up killing the patient being transported to the hospital, an epileptic in a coffee shop is treated along with someone having a heart attack at a dance bar. A pier at the Embarcadero catches on fire.

&quot;Greatest Rescues of &quot;Emergency!&quot;&quot;: Gage and DeSoto are both promoted to the rank of captain, at which rank they were no longer permitted to hold paramedic certification. They think back to their time on Squad 51 and some of the rescues they carried out. Robert A. Cinader wrote and directed the framing story, which included clips from other such installments as the pilot, on whose writing Harold Jack Bloom had collaborated with Cinader. This film marked the &quot;official&quot; ending of the series.

&quot;The Convention&quot;: John and Roy are back in San Francisco for a paramedic convention and they ride along with the San Francisco Fire Department&#x27;s paramedics.

The TV movies were shown in syndication as two-part episodes starting in the 1980s. They also aired on TV Land in 2001, on MeTV in June 2015, and on Cozi TV in late 2019.

===Other media===
The book &quot;Emergency!: Behind the Scenes&quot; by Richard Yokely and Rozane Sutherland was published in 2008.

Charlton Comics out of Derby, Connecticut, published several issues of an &quot;Emergency!&quot; comic book in the mid-1970s, geared towards young readers. One of the issues contains some of the earliest published work of John Byrne. Charlton also published four issues of an illustrated black-and-white magazine geared more towards adult readers featuring art by Neal Adams and others, these projects were overseen by publisher Steve Kahn, in parallel with similar books for &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Wonderland Records produced three original audio dramas based on &quot;Emergency!&quot;; these were released on a single 33 rpm LP. These were: &quot;The Jaws of Life&quot; (in which the title gadget proves its worth when Gage and DeSoto must rescue one man from a subway mishap and another from a burning car; they also help a woman shocked by a high-voltage power line; both are uneasy about supper this week, since Lopez is the designated chef at Station 51), &quot;Front Page Story&quot; (in which Gage and DeSoto, after rescuing an elderly man from a burning – and supposedly abandoned – wharf, must deal with investigative reporter Jenny James ... who&#x27;s been instructed to write an exposé on Squad 51; she observes – and unwittingly complicates – their treatment of a blind teenage diabetic with a fractured skull, who might need on-the-spot surgery to save his life), and &quot;The Used Car Caper&quot; (in which our paramedics assist a security guard shot in a bank robbery, and then a young woman injured by a reckless driver; the latter call ties into the subplot, as DeSoto puts his old car up for sale ... and gets an offer from a fellow who&#x27;s suspiciously eager to close the deal).

Milton Bradley released an &quot;Emergency!&quot; board game in 1973.

=== Syndication ===
The series was first syndicated in 1976, after the fifth season. Local stations mainly aired it between 4:30 and 6 p.m. Eastern (3:30 to 5:00 Central) for the same viewers that were its most loyal audience on NBC, elementary school-aged children. However, &quot;Emergency!&quot; was not nearly as successful in reruns as &quot;Dragnet 1967–70&quot; and &quot;Adam-12&quot; were. When the program was first syndicated, it went by the title &quot;Emergency One!&quot; (the stock title &quot;Emergency!&quot; appeared with the word &quot;One&quot; fading in beneath) to avoid confusion with the new episodes still airing Saturday nights on NBC and continued to be called that when the TV movies aired as well. The syndicated episodes would revert to the original title, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, in 1979. Renaming programs for syndication was commonplace until the 1980s. Although in the early 2000s it had a brief run on TV Land, &quot;Emergency!&quot; had been rarely seen in recent times because the series had come under the ownership of the Jack Webb Estate. The show is now seen on MeTV.

&quot;Emergency!&quot; seasons 1 – 6 were available on Netflix on Demand in high definition (though several episodes are missing due to rights issues), having been restored and rescanned from the original film negatives. The series ran on MeTV from September 2013 to December 2016, an over-the-air service mainly seen on digital subchannels of local television stations. Starting in January 2017, the series moved to the NBC Universal-owned digital broadcast network Cozi TV. As of Spring 2022, the series airs on FETV, a satellite and cable network featuring classic programming and family entertainment. It is only available for purchase on DVD in the US from Universal Studios Home Entertainment and through major retailers. Until September 2024, it aired on Cozi TV. On October 14, 2024, MeTV resumed airing the show airing weekdays at 5 p.m. ET. As of 2024, the series streams on the Peacock streaming service.

===Home media===
In 1998, Universal Studios released 39 episodes on VHS, in a 20-volume set, distributed through Columbia House. The videocassettes each contained 2 episodes from the series, except for the first one, which only contained the two-hour pilot.

Universal Studios has released all six seasons of &quot;Emergency!&quot; and the six post-series tele-films (as &quot;The Final Rescues&quot;), on DVD in Region 1.

On July 12, 2016, Universal released &quot;Emergency! – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 32-disc set contains all 122 episodes of the series as well as the 6 post-series tele-films.

In 2017–2018, Universal re-released the first two seasons on DVD in new single sided disc collections.

Note: &quot;Seasons 1 &amp; 2 in the complete series set were released on single sided discs; they were originally released on double sided discs in the individual season sets.&quot;

== Los Angeles County Fire Museum ==

The Los Angeles County Fire Museum currently houses the Universal-built Squad 51, both Engines 51 (the renumbered Crown Los Angeles County Fire Department Engine 60 and the Ward-LaFrance-donated Engine 51), a 1969 Chevrolet ambulance and various equipment used on the show. Such equipment includes: the orange &quot;BioPhone&quot;, black &quot;drug box&quot; (tackle box), defibrillator, OB/GYN, radios, turnout coats, gear, various cast photographs, and other paraphernalia used on the show.

The museum, which relocated to 16400 Bellflower Blvd, Bellflower, California, USA (33.8842615N, 118.1259962W) in July, 2018, allows fans to photograph and (for special events) touch / handle the various equipment. Some of the equipment is signed by various actors from the show.

<text>John Leslie Coogan (October 26, 1914 – March 1, 1984) was an American actor and comedian who began his film career as a child actor in silent films. Coogan&#x27;s role in Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s film &quot;The Kid&quot; (1921) made him one of the first child stars in the history of Hollywood.

He later sued his mother and stepfather over his squandered film earnings and provoked California to enact the first known legal protection for the earnings of child performers, the California Child Actor&#x27;s Bill, widely known as the &quot;Coogan Act&quot;.

Coogan continued to act throughout his life, later earning renewed fame in middle age portraying Uncle Fester in the 1960s television series &quot;The Addams Family&quot;.

==Early life and education ==

John Leslie Coogan was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1914 to John Henry Jr. and Lillian Rita (née Dolliver) Coogan. He began performing as an infant in both vaudeville and film, with the title role (uncredited) in the 1917 film &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Baby&quot;. Charlie Chaplin discovered him in the Orpheum Theatre, a vaudeville house in Los Angeles, on the stage doing the shimmy, a then-popular dance. Coogan&#x27;s father was also an actor.

Coogan was a natural mimic and delighted Chaplin with his abilities. Chaplin cast him in a small role in &quot;A Day&#x27;s Pleasure&quot; (1919). The following year, Chaplin cast Coogan as the abandoned child raised by his Tramp character in the silent comedy-drama &quot;The Kid&quot; (1921). In 1922, Coogan was cast in the title role in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, directed by Frank Lloyd. Coogan was one of the first stars to be heavily merchandised. Peanut butter, stationery, whistles, dolls, records, coins and figurines were among the Coogan-themed merchandise on sale.

Coogan had been privately tutored until the age of 10 and then sent to a military academy and prep schools until he was 16. He entered Santa Clara University in 1932, flunked out, and transferred to the University of Southern California, intending to obtain a business or law degree.

In May 1935, 20-year-old Coogan was the sole survivor of a car crash on the winding San Diego-Imperial Valley Highway, in eastern San Diego County that killed his father, his 19-year-old best friend, actor Trent (&quot;Junior&quot;) Durkin, their ranch foreman Charles Jones, and actor and writer Robert J. Horner. The party was returning from a day of dove hunting just over the Mexican border. With Coogan&#x27;s father at the wheel, the car was forced off the mountain highway near Pine Valley by an oncoming vehicle and rolled down an embankment. Durkin had been a costar of Coogan&#x27;s in the Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn films. Jackie, who had been thrown from the rumble seat, suffered two broken ribs and bruises.

==Charity work==
While a child actor, Coogan worked with Near East Relief and toured across the United States and Europe in 1924 on a &quot;Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; as part of his fundraising drive. His efforts provided more than $1 million in clothing, food, and other contributions ($14.8 million in 2021 dollars), and he was honored by officials in the United States and Greece. He also had an audience with Pope Pius XI.

A Catholic, Coogan was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills.

==Coogan Act==
As a child star, Coogan earned an estimated $3,000,000 () to $4,000,000 (). When he turned 21 in October 1935, his fortune was believed to be well intact. His assets had been conservatively managed by his father, who had died in a car accident five months earlier.

Coogan soon discovered, though, that nearly the entire amount had been squandered by his mother and stepfather, Arthur Bernstein, on fur coats, diamonds and other jewelry, and expensive cars. Bernstein had been a financial advisor for the family and married Coogan&#x27;s mother in late 1936.

Coogan&#x27;s mother and stepfather claimed Jackie enjoyed himself and simply thought he was playing before the camera. She insisted, &quot;No promises were ever made to give Jackie anything&quot;, and claimed he &quot;was a bad boy&quot;.

Coogan sued them in 1938, but after his legal expenses, he received just $126,000 () of the $250,000 () remaining of his earnings. When Coogan went broke during the litigation, he asked Charlie Chaplin for assistance; Chaplin handed him $1,000 () in cash without hesitation.

The legal battle focused attention on child actors and resulted in the 1939 enactment of the California Child Actor&#x27;s Bill, often referred to as the &quot;Coogan Law&quot; or the &quot;Coogan Act&quot;. It required that a child actor&#x27;s employer set aside 15% of the earnings in a trust (called a Coogan account) and specified the actor&#x27;s schooling, work hours, and time off.

==Adult career==

===Film===
Coogan appeared with then-wife Betty Grable in &quot;College Swing&quot;, a 1938 musical comedy starring George Burns, Gracie Allen, Martha Raye, and Bob Hope.

Coogan enlisted in the U.S. Army in March 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor that December, he requested a transfer to Army Air Forces as a glider pilot because of his civilian flying experience. He graduated from the Advanced Glider School with the glider pilot aeronautical rating and the rank of flight officer, he volunteered for hazardous duty with the 1st Air Commando Group.

In December 1943, the unit was sent to India. He flew British troops, the Chindits, under General Orde Wingate, on March 5, 1944, landing them at night in a small jungle clearing behind Japanese lines in the Burma Campaign.

He also appeared in episode 37, titled &quot;Barney on the Rebound&quot;, of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, which aired October 31, 1961.

Coogan had a regular role in a 1962–63 NBC series, &quot;McKeever and the Colonel&quot;. He finally found his most famous television role as Uncle Fester in ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1964–1966). He later voiced Uncle Fester in The &quot;Addams Family&quot; animated series (1973–1975) and reprised the character in the TV film &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot; (1977).

Coogan was taken to Santa Monica Hospital, where he died from cardiac arrest.

At Coogan&#x27;s request, his funeral was open to the public and was attended by several fans. John Astin, Coogan&#x27;s co-star from &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, delivered the eulogy. Coogan was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City. His star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located at 1654 Vine Street, just south of Hollywood Boulevard.

<doc id="191105" wikidata="Q7432684" url="?curid=191105" title="Schoolhouse Rock!">
<text>Schoolhouse Rock! is an American interstitial programming series of animated musical educational short films (and later, music videos) which aired during the Saturday morning children&#x27;s programming block on the U.S. television network ABC. The themes covered included grammar, science, economics, history, mathematics, and civics. The series&#x27; original run lasted from 1973 to 1985; it was later revived from 1993 to 1996. Additional episodes were produced in 2009 for direct-to-video release.

==History==
===Idea and development===
The series was the idea of David McCall, an advertising executive of McCaffrey and McCall, who noticed his young son was struggling with learning multiplication tables, despite being able to memorize the lyrics of many Rolling Stones songs. McCall hired musician Bob Dorough to write a song that would teach multiplication, which became &quot;Three Is a Magic Number.&quot; Tom Yohe, an illustrator at McCaffrey and McCall, heard the song and created visuals to accompany it. Radford Stone, producer and writer at ABC, suggested they pitch it as a television series, which caught the attention of Michael Eisner, then the senior vice president in charge of programming and development at ABC, and cartoon director Chuck Jones.

===Original series===

The first video of the series, &quot;Three Is a Magic Number,&quot; originally debuted during the debut episode of &quot;Curiosity Shop&quot; on September 2, 1971. The Curiosity Shop version is an extended cut which includes an additional scene/verse of 15 seconds in length that explains the pattern of each set of ten containing three multiples of three, animated in the form of a carnival shooting game. This scene has never been rebroadcast on ABC, nor has it been included in any home media releases; the longer version is, however, available on the soundtrack album, as is an extended version of &quot;My Hero Zero&quot;. 

&quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; debuted as a series in January 1973 with &quot;Multiplication Rock&quot;, a collection of animated music videos adapting the multiplication tables to songs written by Bob Dorough. Dorough also performed most of the songs, with Grady Tate performing two and Blossom Dearie performing one during this season. General Foods was the series&#x27; first sponsor; later sponsors of the &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; segments also included Nabisco, Kenner Toys, Kellogg&#x27;s, and McDonald&#x27;s. During the early 1970s, &quot;Schoolhouse Rock&quot; was one of several short-form animated educational shorts that aired on ABC&#x27;s children&#x27;s lineup; others included &quot;Time for Timer&quot; and &quot;The Bod Squad.&quot; Of the three, &quot;Schoolhouse Rock&quot; was the longest running.

George Newall and Tom Yohe were the executive producers and creative directors of every episode, along with Bob Dorough as musical director. This first season was followed in short order by a second season, run from 1973 to 1975, entitled &quot;Grammar Rock&quot;, which included nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech (such as conjunctions, explained in &quot;Conjunction Junction&quot;). For this second season, the show added the services of Jack Sheldon, a member of &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; house band, as well as Lynn Ahrens; both of them contributed to the series through the rest of its run. Blossom Dearie returned for a second episode, and Essra Mohawk joined the cast as a recurring singer.

To coincide with the upcoming United States Bicentennial, a third season, &quot;America Rock&quot;, airing in 1975 and 1976, had music videos covering the structure of the United States government (such as &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Bill&quot;) along with important moments in American history (examples include &quot;The Preamble&quot; and &quot;Mother Necessity&quot;).

A fourth series, titled &quot;Science Rock,&quot; followed in 1978 and 1979, and included a broad range of science-related topics. The first video of this season, &quot;A Victim of Gravity,&quot; parodied elements of the hit film &quot;Grease&quot; and featured a rare guest appearance from a pop band, with recently reunited doo-wop group the Tokens providing the vocals. In addition to episodes describing the human body&#x27;s anatomical systems (the nervous, circulatory, skeletal and digestive systems each received a music video), episodes describing physical sciences such as astronomy, meteorology and electricity were also included, as was &quot;The Energy Blues,&quot; an environmentalism-themed video.

A fifth follow-up series, titled &quot;Scooter Computer and Mr. Chips,&quot; featuring the titular characters (the only music videos in the series to feature any recurring characters), premiered in the early 1980s and comprised just four segments about home computer technology, then just emerging onto the scene. As the references and depictions became quickly outdated, due to the rapid advance of technology, these segments stopped airing after 1985 and were not released on home video until the 30th anniversary DVD in 2002.

===1990s===
After leaving the airwaves in 1985, the original team reunited to produce two more Grammar Rock segments (&quot;Busy Prepositions&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Mr. Morton&quot;) for television in 1993 with J. J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. This was followed in 1995 by a new series, &quot;Money Rock,&quot; which discussed themes related to money management on both the personal and governmental scale. Episodes from the new series aired in rotation with the original segments from 1993 to 1996.

The Walt Disney Company acquired &quot;Schoolhouse Rock&quot; in 1996 along with its acquisition of ABC owner Capital Cities/ABC Inc.; &quot;Schoolhouse Rock&quot; was one of only two non-Disney children&#x27;s shows (&quot;The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show&quot; being the other) to continue airing (albeit in reruns) after the transition to One Saturday Morning. The series as a whole (after 27 years, shortly before the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary) ceased airing on television in 2000, with newer episodes being released directly to home video. However, reruns occasionally aired on Toon Disney&#x27;s &quot;Big Movie Show&quot; block in 2004, but were soon removed from the schedule.

===21st century===
Starting in 2002, the team once again reunited to produce a new song, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Send Your Vote to College,&quot; written by George Newall and performed by Bob Dorough and Jack Sheldon for the 30th Anniversary VHS and DVD releases. For the new song, Tom Yohe Jr. took over as lead designer for his father, Tom Yohe Sr., who had died in 2000. Another contemporary song, called &quot;Presidential Minute,&quot; also written by George Newall, which explained the process of electing the President of the United States in greater detail, was included on the 2008 DVD &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Election Collection&quot;, which centered on songs relating to American history and government.

In 2009, in response to the threat of climate change, a new series of shorts was released directly to DVD, with the title &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Earth&quot;. Animations were created by members of the original production team, and 11 environmentally themed songs were written and performed by a combination of veterans of the original series (including Bob Dorough, Jack Sheldon, and Lynn Ahrens) and newcomers such as composer George Stiles and performers Tituss Burgess, Barrett Foa, and Shoshana Bean, all of whom were veterans of Broadway theatre. In a first for the series, an additional 12th song, &quot;The 3 R&#x27;s,&quot; a reworked version of &quot;Three Is a Magic Number&quot; rethemed around the message &quot;reduce, reuse, recycle,&quot; was included as a live action music video (starring singer Mitchel Musso) rather than as a new cartoon. Also unique to this iteration of the series was the inclusion of interstitial introductions featuring recurring animated characters created for the DVD, Jack, Bob, and Lou, a trio of Arctic polar bears.

On January 6, 2013, George Newall and Bob Dorough appeared at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., as part of their ongoing series of free concerts on the Millennium Stage. It was deemed the largest attendance to date of the venue. Dorough played five songs, accompanying himself on the piano: &quot;Three Is a Magic Number,&quot; &quot;Figure Eight,&quot; &quot;Conjunction Junction,&quot; &quot;Preamble,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Bill.&quot; (Dorough had only performed lead vocals on the original version of &quot;Three Is a Magic Number&quot;). He also performed &quot;Interjections!&quot; accompanied by DC-area kids&#x27; band Rocknoceros. Rocknoceros also performed &quot;Electricity, Electricity,&quot; &quot;Unpack Your Adjectives,&quot; &quot;Energy Blues,&quot; and &quot;Fireworks.&quot;

On March 20, 2019, it was announced that &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!: The Box Set&quot; (1996) was added to the Library of Congress National Recording Registry in its 2018 class.

==Music videos==
===Multiplication Rock===
No shows were produced featuring the number 1 explicitly, though several of them, including &quot;Elementary, My Dear,&quot; do include this number. &quot;My Hero, Zero&quot; introduced the subject of how to use zero for multiplying by 10, 100, and 1,000. &quot;Little Twelvetoes&quot; introduced the subject of how math arranged on base 12 rather than on base 10 would work, as well as covering multiplication by 12.

In 1973, Capitol Records released a soundtrack album of &quot;Multiplication Rock&quot; (SJA-11174), featuring all 11 songs. Two tracks, &quot;My Hero, Zero&quot; and &quot;Three Is a Magic Number,&quot; had been edited for TV to keep each video within three minutes. This LP features both songs in their full, uncut forms. Also, the album version of &quot;The Four-Legged Zoo&quot; has a slightly shorter ending compared to the television version. Released with the album was a single (Capitol 3693) with the two Grady Tate–sung tracks (&quot;Naughty Number Nine&quot; b/w &quot;I Got Six&quot;). This album was re-released on red/blue-colored vinyl on Record Store Day 2019.

===Grammar Rock===
This segment introduces Jack Sheldon and Lynn Ahrens as series regulars. &quot;Conjunction Junction&quot; and &quot;A Noun Is a Person, Place, or Thing&quot; were Sheldon and Ahrens&#x27; debuts on &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; respectively.

&quot;Busy Prepositions&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Busy P&#x27;s&quot;) and &quot;The Tale of Mr. Morton&quot; were produced for &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot;″s return to ABC in 1993 with J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. producing the animation.

===America Rock===
&quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Send Your Vote to College&quot; and &quot;Presidential Minute&quot; were produced for DVD.
&quot;Three Ring Government&quot; had its airdate pushed back due to ABC fearing that the Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. Government, and Congress would object to having their functions and responsibilities being compared to a circus and threaten the network&#x27;s broadcast license renewal.

===Science Rock===
* In the Disney+ version of &quot;Electricity, Electricity,&quot; the flashing light visuals for the &quot;electricity&quot; text are toned down to reduce the risk of anyone with photosensitive epilepsy.
* Sometime after its initial airing, &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth,&quot; also known as &quot;The Weather Show,&quot; was pulled from broadcast rotation because the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus objected to its use of their trademark slogan (which was in the questioned title) and filed a lawsuit against the network for copyright infringement. As a result, the 1995 VHS of the program (and subsequent VHS reissues) deleted the song. However, it was included in the 1987 &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; VHS release, and in 2002 it was included on the bonus disc of the &quot;Special 30th Anniversary Edition&quot; DVD (see below).

===Computer Rock===
===Money Rock===
===Earth Rock===
These songs did not air on ABC. They premiered on a DVD released in 2009. They were also available for purchase on iTunes.

==Tie-ins==
Several tie-ins were released in 1995:
* &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks&quot;, a tribute album featuring covers of &quot;Schoolhouse Rocks&quot; songs performed by popular music artists (see below).
* &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! The Official Guide&quot; (), written by Tom Yohe and George Newall, and including synopses, lyrics, and production notes about each of the shorts created to date, except &quot;The Weather Show,&quot; which was the subject of pending litigation and so could not be included. &quot;The Weather Show&quot; was shown with all the other Science Rock episodes in 1979. The book was updated in 2023 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the show, with songs added from Money Rock.
* &quot;The Schoolhouse Rock Songbook&quot; (Cherry Lane Music), containing sheet music for 10 songs.
* &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Soundtrack&quot; The 4-CD release with bonus tracks on each CD was released on June 18, 1996, by Rhino Records.

&quot;The Best of Schoolhouse Rock&quot; () was released in 1998 jointly by American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. and Rhino Records.

===Home video===
A 1987 production of the series for VHS tapes released by Golden Book Video featured Cloris Leachman opening the collection and some songs with child dancers and singers. Three songs (namely &quot;Three Ring Government,&quot; &quot;The Good Eleven,&quot; and &quot;Little Twelvetoes&quot;) were yes included on the videos.

In 1995, ABC Video and Image Entertainment released two volumes of &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; on LaserDisc, &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Volume 1: Multiplication Rock and Grammar Rock&quot; (ID3245CC), and &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Volume 2: America Rock and Science Rock&quot; (ID3383CC). For both volumes, the first side was in the CLV Extended Play format and the second was in the frame-accessible CAV format, and both contained CX-encoded analog and digital audio soundtracks. The &quot;Grammar Rock&quot; volume included the 1993 shorts &quot;Busy Prepositions&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Mr. Morton.&quot;

In 1994, ABC/King Features sold exclusive licensing rights for apparel to Coastal Concepts, Inc. of Vista California, the first company to produce &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; apparel. Tom Yohe worked with contemporary artist Skya Nelson to create over 50 new designs and update the &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; image for a new market, which sold $1.1 million in its first year and exploded selling over $12 million the next year. A variety of bands working with Rhino Records were furnished with newly minted &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; T-shirts for the music videos youth market. The licensing rights were expanded to include other manufacturers in 1996.

In 1995, ABC teamed with Paramount Home Video and re-released four segments of &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; on VHS with alternative covers and opening.

In 1997–1998, for the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Walt Disney Home Video, which became a sister company to ABC after their purchase in 1996, released five segments on VHS, along with &quot;Money Rock&quot; being released in 1998. The other four releases in the 25th anniversary collection each ended with a &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks&quot; music video.

On August 27, 2002, Walt Disney Home Entertainment released a 2-DVD set to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the show. The set features 52 of the 53 episodes that had been produced up to that point, including three of the lost &quot;Computer Rock&quot; segments, with the exception of &quot;Introduction.&quot; &quot;The Weather Show&quot; and &quot;Presidential Minute&quot; are found on the bonus disc, the former in modified form with the problematic lyric removed, and the latter viewable only upon completing the &quot;Earn Your Diploma&quot; Trivia Game. An abbreviated VHS, featuring 25 episodes (ranked on the tape in order of popularity) and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Send Your Vote to College,&quot; was released at the same time.

In 2008, DVDs of the individual &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; series were released for classroom use.

On September 23, 2008, &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Election Collection&quot; was released, including 14 songs about American history and the government and a &quot;new to DVD&quot; song.

On March 31, 2009, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Earth&quot;, including 11 newly written and animated songs, as well as &quot;Energy Blues.&quot;

=== Tribute albums ===
In 1996, the album &quot;Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks&quot; was released by Rhino Records, with fifteen covers of &quot;Schoolhouse Rock&quot; songs including the theme. Covers by notable artists included &quot;Three is a Magic Number&quot; by Blind Melon, &quot;No More Kings&quot; by Pavement, &quot;The Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot; by Ween, &quot;My Hero, Zero&quot; by The Lemonheads and &quot;Verb: That&#x27;s What&#x27;s Happening&quot; by Moby.

On August 18, 1998, Rhino also released &quot;Schoolhouse Rocks the Vote!: A Benefit for Rock the Vote&quot;, a tribute album containing covers and original songs in the style of &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot;, all with an electoral theme. It was released as a fundraiser for Rock the Vote, an organization advocating for political awareness and voting among young people. Several well-known artists contributed tracks to the album, including Isaac Hayes, Joan Osborne, The Sugarhill Gang and The Roots, alongside original &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; performers Bob Dorough, Essra Mohawk and Grady Tate.

<text>Bolzano ( ; ; or ) is the capital city of South Tyrol (officially the province of Bolzano), Northern Italy. With a population of 108,245, Bolzano is also by far the largest city in South Tyrol and the third largest in historical Tyrol. The greater metro area has about 250,000 inhabitants and is one of the urban centres within the Alps.

Bolzano is the seat of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, where lectures and seminars are held in English, German, and Italian. The city is also home to the Italian Army&#x27;s Alpini High Command (COMALP) and some of its combat and support units. In the 2020 version of the annual ranking of quality of life in Italian cities, Bolzano was ranked jointly first for quality of life alongside Bologna.

Along with other Alpine towns in South Tyrol, Bolzano engages in the Alpine Town of the Year Association for the implementation of the Alpine Convention. The Convention aims to promote and achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc. Consequently, Bolzano was awarded the 2009 Alpine Town of the Year. Bolzano is considered a bridge between Northern Europe and Southern Europe due to the three spoken languages in South Tyrol (Italian, German, and Ladin) and the confluence of the Italian and German-Austrian cultures.

== Geography ==


===Location===
The area of the city of Bolzano is , of which is used as a settlement area. The city is located in the basin where the Sarntal, Eisacktal, and the Adige Valley with their rivers, Talfer, Eisack, and Adige, meet. In the Middle Ages, the two main Alpine crossings, the Via Claudia Augusta over Reschenpass and the Brenner route over Brenner Pass, met in Bolzano. Thus, the city was very important for trading. The highest point is above sea level and the lowest point is above sea level. The centre is located at an altitude of above sea level. The nearest big cities are (Trento) and (Innsbruck) away.

===City districts and neighbouring communities===

City districts (most district names were originally in German and italianized at a later stage):
* Centro-Piani-Rencio/Zentrum-Bozner Boden-Rentsch
* Don Bosco/Don Bosco-Neugries
* Europa-Novacella/Europa-Neustift
* Gries-San Quirino/Gries-Quirein
* Oltrisarco-Aslago/Oberau-Haslach

In 1911 Zwölfmalgreien and in late 1925 the Gries municipality were incorporated in the Bolzano civic district. Neighbouring communities are: Eppan, Karneid, Laives, Deutschnofen, Ritten, Jenesien, Terlan and Vadena.

===Climate===
Being located at multiple climate borders, Bolzano features a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot summers and very cold winters by Italian standards. According to the Trewartha classification, this climate could not be really considered a subtropical climate because fewer than 8 months are at least , and thus would be considered a semi-continental climate with hot summers. Some of its suburbs are designated an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) based on cooler summer temperatures, while mountains in the area may feature a continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). The climate of Bolzano is influenced by its low altitude in a valley south of the main Alps. This causes very sheltered conditions from cool winds during daytime, ensuring much warmer temperatures year-round than in similar valley cities north of the range.

==Demographics==

===Linguistic distribution===

According to the 2024 census, 74.71% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants spoke Italian, 24.74% German and 0.55% Ladin as their first language.
Through fascism and the Italianization policy under Benito Mussolini in the inter-war period, the Italian language group became the majority in Bolzano. Prior to the annexation of South Tyrol to Italy (Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 1919) a small Italophone community of up to 10% of the population already lived in Bolzano.

==History==


=== Prehistory and Roman settlement ===
The modern-day Bolzano was in ancient times a marshy region inhabited by the Raetian Isarci people, traditionally believed to be descendants of Etruscan refugees fleeing Italy from the invading Gauls. The Romans built a settlement after the area had been conquered in 15 BC by general Nero Claudius Drusus. The military settlement, &quot;Pons Drusi&quot; (Drusus Bridge), was named after this Roman general. During this time the area became part of the region Venetia et Histria (Regio X) of ancient Italy.

In 1948, excavations of the current Cathedral led to the discovery of an ancient Christian basilica from the fourth century. Also discovered was a Roman cemetery, including the tomb of &quot;Secundus Regontius&quot; with Latin inscriptions dating to the third century, making him the oldest known inhabitant of Bolzano.

=== Bavarian settlement ===
During the gradual decline of the Lombard influence in the seventh century, Bavarian immigration took place and the first mention of a Bavarian ruler in Bolzano dates from 679. At that time, the Bavarians named the nearby villages around Bolzano &quot;Bauzanum&quot; or &quot;Bauzana&quot;. In 769 Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria issued in Bolzano the foundation charter of the Innichen Abbey. German populations have been present in the region of Tyrol from that period onwards. At around the year 1000, the settlement is called &quot;in Pauzana valle, quae lingua Teutisca Pozana nuncupatur&quot;.

=== Bishopric of Trent ===

In 1027 the area of Bolzano and the rest of the Diocese was conferred upon the bishops of Trent by the emperor Conrad II from the Salian dynasty. In the late-12th century, the bishop founded a market town, along the &quot;Lauben&quot; thoroughfare. The town therefore became an important trading post on the Transalpine Augsburg-Venice route over the Brenner Pass, elevation above sea level, within the Holy Roman Empire.

=== County of Tyrol ===
In 1277 Bolzano was conquered by Meinhard II, the Count of Tyrol, leading to a struggle between the counts of Tyrol and the bishops of Trent. In 1363, the County of Tyrol passed to the Austrian House of Habsburg. In 1381, Duke Leopold granted the citizens of Bolzano the privilege of a town council. This gradually eliminated the influence and power previously held by the bishops of Trent over the next few decades. In 1462, the bishops eventually resigned all their rights of jurisdiction over the town.

From the 14th and 15th centuries onwards, a large market fair was organised four times per year to greet tradesmen and merchants en-route the Brenner Pass. The Mercantile Magistrate was therefore founded in 1635 by the Austrian duchess Claudia de&#x27; Medici. During every market season, two Italian and two Germanic officers, who were appointed among the local tradesmen, worked in this magistrate office. The establishment of an official trade organisation strengthened Bolzano as a cultural crossroad in the Alps.

After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Bolzano became briefly part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and was incorporated into the &quot;Department of Alto Adige&quot;. After the Congress of Vienna (1814-15) Bolzano returned to the County of Tyrol, within the Austrian Empire and subsequently the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867. The County covered both modern-day South Tyrol, Trentino and the federal state of Tyrol (including East Tyrol) in Austria.

In 1915, the Triple Entente powers promised Italy territorial gains if she would enter the First World War on the side of the Entente instead of siding with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. When Italy abandoned the Triple Alliance (1882), the Entente offered her territorial promises in Tyrol and Istria. This secret arrangement was confirmed in the Treaty of London (1915).

After Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on May 24, 1915, heavy fighting took place all along Tyrol&#x27;s southern border for the entire duration of the conflict. For the next years Tyrol&#x27;s southern border became the front line between Austro-Hungarian and Italian troops. Tyrol&#x27;s south frontier was – and still is – dotted with tens of defensive fortresses that had been built in view of a possible Italian attack. Losses on both sides amount to several thousands. During World War I, tens of thousands of civilians living along Tyrol&#x27;s southern border were evacuated to either of the two countries, the majority to Bohemian and inner Austrian areas, and some to Italian internment camps, away from the front line.

=== Annexation by Italy ===

On November 3, 1918, the armistice of Villa Giusti, near Padova, ended military operations between Italy and Austria-Hungary. Subsequently, Italian troops entered Tyrol and occupied the Austrian areas south of the Brenner Pass. Italian control of South Tyrol was internationally recognized in 1919. At the time of Bolzano&#x27;s annexation by the Kingdom of Italy the town was settled primarily by a German-speaking population. As of 1910, inhabitants identified themselves as German speakers and only 1,300 as Italian speakers, these latter ones mainly from the Italian speaking areas of Tyrol, namely Welschtirol, currently known as Trentino.

Along with the rest of South Tyrol, Bolzano was subjected to an intensive Italianisation programme enforced by Fascist leader Benito Mussolini from the 1920s onwards to September 8, 1943, when Italy left the military alliance with Nazi Germany and South Tyrol fell under direct German control. The goal of such programme was to outnumber the local German-speaking population by tripling Bolzano&#x27;s population through Italian immigration from other regions of Italy. In 1927 Bolzano became the capital of the province of Bolzano. Any reference to and use of the words Tyrol and Tyrolean were banned by law and were punishable offences. In 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power in the Weimar Republic. Mussolini and the Fascists worried that Hitler, in pursuing his ideology of &quot;all ethnic Germans under one Reich&quot;, would claim South Tyrol from Italy. To avoid such a prospect, in 1939 Mussolini and Hitler signed the Option Agreement, by which Germany would renounce territorial claims over South Tyrol as Germany&#x27;s &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space). Furthermore, ethnic South-Tyroleans who had opted to stay in South Tyrol and refused resettlement to the Third Reich were subjected to full-scale Italianisation, including loss of their German names and national identity, prohibition of schooling in German and use of German for their daily transactions.

=== Second World War ===
During the Second World War, Bolzano was the site of the Nazis&#x27; Bolzano Transit Camp, a concentration camp for persecuted Jews and political prisoners. Members of the Jewish population of Bolzano were deported to the death camps in Nazi Germany and murdered there. When Italy surrendered in September 1943, the whole of South Tyrol as well as Belluno were &quot;de facto&quot; administered by the Nazis as Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills. After 1943, heavy fighting between Nazi Germany and the Allied Powers took place in the Dolomites.

=== Capital of an autonomous province ===
After the War, the Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement of September 1946 was signed by the Italian and Austrian Foreign Ministers in Paris, guaranteeing &quot;complete equality of rights&quot; (including education and use of German as an official language) as well as &quot;autonomous legislative and executive regional power&quot; to the German-speaking population in South Tyrol and Trentino.

Because the implementation of the post-war agreement was not seen as satisfactory by the Austrian government (the autonomous province of 1947 included Trentino and therefore had an Italian-speaking majority), it became a cause of significant friction with Italy and was brought to the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1960, which called for a resolution of the issue. A fresh round of negotiations took place in 1961 but proved unsuccessful, partly because of the campaign of terrorism by South Tyrolean Liberation Committee – a secessionist movement – against Italian police and electric power structures (one notable incident being the Night of Fire on 12 June 1961).

The issue was resolved in 1971, when a new statute of autonomy for the smaller, majority German-speaking province Bozen – Südtirol/Bolzano – Alto Adige, which was supported by the German-speaking population of South Tyrol, was granted by Italy. It resulted in a considerable level of self-government, also due to the large financial resources of South Tyrol, which retains almost 90% of all levied taxes. The agreement was implemented and proved broadly satisfactory to the parties involved and the separatist tensions soon eased. In 1992, Austria and Italy officially ended their dispute over the autonomy issue on the basis of the statute of 1972.

==Economy==
The city thrives on a mix of old and new high-quality intensive agriculture (including wine, fruit, and dairy products), tourism, traditional handicraft (wood, ceramics), and advanced services. Heavy industry (machinery, automotive, and steel) installed during the 1930s has now been mostly dismantled. The local economy is very dependent on the public sector and especially the provincial government.

Bolzano is the biggest city in South Tyrol, which is an autonomous province in Northern Italy with a special statute. This statute preserves the rights of the German-speaking minority in Italy. This unique system was admired by the Dalai Lama, who visited the city on several occasions to study a possible application in Tibet. It has also been presented as role model for the successful and fair resolution of inter-ethnic conflict to other regions of the world.

===Exhibition Bolzano===

The tradeshows and conferences of Exhibition Bolzano are concentrated on topics relating to the economies of Alpine countries. There is thus a great focus on trade show subjects in the economic competence of South Tyrol and Trentino. The main focuses of dining and leisure time, sports, agriculture and specific Alpine industries attract an annual total of over 3000 exhibitors and over visitors from all over Europe.

===Italian German Business Forum Bozen-Bolzano===
Since 2011, the city hosts the Italo-Germanic Business Forum, which brings together the leaders of the Italian and German economies – Confindustria and the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie – in the Mercantile Palace to address issues related to the international crisis.

===Companies===

Large companies in Bolzano are:
* THUN S.p.A. SB (AG)
* FERCAM S.p.A. (AG)
* Spar (retailer) Italia S.p.A.
* Acciaierie Valbruna S.p.A.

The concept that NOI Techpark is based on has research institutes, companies and start-ups from South Tyrol and all over the globe working together to prepare the ground for a sustainable development.

Working with representatives from South Tyrol&#x27;s business and research communities, BLS and TIS innovation park have developed the park&#x27;s &quot;Nature of Innovation&quot; positioning title, the initials of which give the park its name: NOI. The name reflects two meanings in South Tyrol: depending on how you want to pronounce it, NOI can either sound like the Italian word for &quot;we&quot; or the South Tyrolean dialect word for &quot;new&quot;.
A special focus lies on those fields:
* Alpine Technology
* Renewable Energies and Energy Efficiency
* Food Technology
* ICT &amp; Automation

====Free University of Bolzano-Bozen====
The Free University of Bolzano-Bozen, founded in October 1997, is actively involved in basic and applied research projects through its five faculties, of which four are located in Bolzano.

Until summer 2015 there was a regular connection between Bolzano Airport (IATA: BZO) and Rome. In summer charter flights are offered to Cagliari, Olbia, Lamezia Terme and Catania.

Since 1966 a cable car connects the centre of Bolzano with Oberbozen-Soprabolzano and the community of Ritten. In 2009 the Italian manufacturer Leitner replaced the old cable car with a new modern 3S system. Although the so-called &quot;Rittner Seilbahn&quot; primarily serves the tourist market, it also provides an important transit link for the residents of Renon. The cable car system, which can carry up to 726 persons per hour, is the first tricable gondola lift in Italy.

<text>Philippa de Roet (also known as Philippa Pan or Philippa Chaucer; – c. 1387) was an English courtier, the sister of Katherine Swynford (third wife of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster – a son of King Edward III) and the wife of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer.

==Early life==
Philippa was the daughter of Sir Gilles de Roet, who was a herald and, later, a knight of Hainault and accompanied Queen Philippa to England. He later became the Guienne King of Arms. There is no history of her mother, but it is thought that Philippa had two sisters and a brother: Katherine, Elizabeth, and Walter. Her father went to serve the queen&#x27;s sister, Marguerite, who was the empress of Germany and the three younger children – Walter, Philippa and Katherine – were left in the care of Queen Philippa.

It was her father&#x27;s relationship with royalty that gave Philippa and her family high status and a reputation among the upper class, who took Philippa in as a &#x27;domicella&#x27;, or lady-in-waiting. This phase of her life began with the households of Elizabeth of Ulster and Queen Philippa, and ended with Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster. These associations proved to be valuable, as Philippa began to receive annuities from Edward III, Richard II, and John of Gaunt, Costanza&#x27;s husband.

Philippa is believed to have picked up the nickname &quot;Philippa Pan&quot; while working at Elizabeth of Ulster&#x27;s household. There are records from 1357 to 1359 from the house of Elizabeth of Ulster which mention &quot;a lady designated as Philippa Pan&quot;. &quot;Pan&quot; may have been an abbreviation of &quot;Panetaria&quot;, meaning mistress of the pantry, which is most likely where Philippa worked in the Ulster household. The name might also come from her father, who sometimes went by &#x27;Paon&#x27; or Payne.

==Marriage to Chaucer and adulthood==
Geoffrey Chaucer was commissioned to work as a page in Elizabeth&#x27;s household in 1357, where Philippa was already working as a domicella, caring for Elizabeth&#x27;s infant daughter, Philippa of Eltham. This is where they are believed to have met; Philippa was around 10 years old at the time and Chaucer was said to be around 12. After Elizabeth&#x27;s death, both were sent to work for the queen. Their marriage might have been arranged by Queen Philippa herself in September 1366. It was apparently tradition for domicellas and esquire who worked in the same household to marry.

Once married, although granddaughter Philippa of Eltham was grown, it was decided they would continue working for her and the king. As a result of this marriage, Queen Philippa and King Edward III granted a lifetime annuity to the couple in 1366. This payment allowed the Chaucers to set up a household within the royal one. Chaucer was then taken into the King&#x27;s household in 1367 and began to receive his own annuity. These salaries gave the Chaucers great financial security and a good lifestyle.
After the death of the queen, Philippa went to the service of Costanza of Castile and John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster. Following Costanza&#x27;s death in 1394, John wed his mistress, Katherine, who was Philippa&#x27;s sister. This connection significantly increased the Chaucers&#x27; status in society. Philippa was much in favour in court as a lady-in-waiting and her husband continued to elevate his reputation. He worked as a Controller of Customs and royal agent. Due to the varying nature of their jobs, Chaucer and Philippa were often forced to spend much of their time apart. This may explain why very little is known about their marriage.
Philippa Roet was somewhat higher born than her husband and consideration has been given to the parallels between their relationship and the one in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which details the relationship between a lower-born knight and a higher-born lady.

==Children==
It is probable that Chaucer and Philippa had &quot;two sons and two daughters&quot;, whose birthdates are unknown. A lurid conspiracy theory was put forth, first by Mary Eliza Haweis in the late nineteenth-century, and then again more influentially by Russell Kraus in 1932, that &quot;one or two&quot; of these children had been illicitly fathered by John of Gaunt. Many scholars, including almost all modern Chaucerians have argued against this theory; H. A. Kelly, for example, has effectively demonstrated that this belief is likely false as John of Gaunt having sexual relations with two sisters would have been considered incest and would have required additional papal dispensation for him to marry Katherine. Samantha Katz Seal argues that literary critics deliberately encouraged the idea of a &quot;harlot&quot; Philippa for the same reason that earlier critics had believed in a &quot;shrewish&quot; Philippa, namely that alienating Chaucer from his wife and domestic circles allowed these critics to imagine a more masculine Chaucer, and to claim that they, his critics, understood Chaucer better than anyone else ever had, especially his wife.

Elizabeth is thought to be the eldest of their children. She is likely the Elizabeth Chaucer who, along with a Margaret Swynford, was nominated a nun by royal privilege at the accession of Richard II in 1377, thus she may have been born as early as 1364. She may have been a nun in Barking Abbey; there are records of an &quot;Elizabeth Chausier&quot; and her nickname being &quot;Chaucy&quot; which leads historians to believe that she was their daughter. It has been suggested that she was named after Elizabeth of Ulster, however it is worth remembering that Philippa had an elder sister, named Elizabeth/Isabel.

Thomas, the eldest son and most well known, might have been born around 1367 judging from the dates he entered the military; it has been suggested, primarily by Russell Kraus, that he was the son of John of Gaunt, whom he served under and received favours from; however, as stated previously, this parentage is unlikely. A strong relationship with Philippa has been suggested due to an assumption that Thomas chose to bear her coat of arms over Chaucer&#x27;s. However, in the Special Collections of the Harvard Library is a deed with the name and seal of Thomas Chaucer using the arms of his father Geoffrey and there is no known example of Thomas Chaucer ever using a seal with the arms of his mother. Confusion over this has likely come about because the tomb of him and his wife, constructed by their daughter, Alice Chaucer, Duchess of Suffolk, uses Roet rather than Chaucer arms.

Very little is known of Lewis and Agnes, the second son and younger daughter. However, it is recorded that Lewis was born in 1381 and sent to the school at Oxford at age 10; it is also known that Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot; was written for Lewis. Agnes, who is believed to be his second daughter, was a lady-in-waiting at Henry IV&#x27;s coronation in 1399.

==Death==
Although there is no precise evidence, Philippa is thought to have died in 1387, due to her last recorded pension being on 18 June 1387. This is evidenced by Chaucer&#x27;s last recorded overseas journey, which was in the same year. It is also suggested that he may have fallen out of favour with the court following her presumed death.

There is a tomb in the church of St Mary, East Worldham in Hampshire, that is thought to be Philippa&#x27;s.

<text>Marie-Joseph Canteloube de Malaret (; 21 October 18794 November 1957) was a French composer, musicologist, and author best known for his collections of orchestrated folksongs from the Auvergne region, &quot;Chants d&#x27;Auvergne&quot;.

==Biography==
Canteloube was born in Annonay, Ardèche, into a family with deep roots in the Auvergne region of France. He studied piano from the age of six with Amélie Doetzer, a friend of Frédéric Chopin. After earning his &quot;baccalauréat&quot;, he worked at a bank in Bordeaux. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1896, he returned to his family home in Malaret (Annonay), remaining there until his mother&#x27;s death in 1899, and then beyond as sole owner of the estate. In 1901, after a period of silence and mourning, Canteloube married Charlotte Marthe Calaret, who gave birth to twins Pierre and Guy in 1903.

He began studying with Vincent d&#x27;Indy via correspondence in 1901, reluctant to leave Malaret. With d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s constant urging, he finally entered the Schola Cantorum in 1907 in Paris, where he remained until the beginning of World War I in 1914. At the Schola, Canteloube became close friends with fellow composer and student Déodat de Séverac.

In 1907, he wrote a suite in four movements for piano and violin entitled &quot;Dans la montagne&quot;, which was played at the Société Nationale. Other significant works followed, including &quot;Colloque sentimental&quot; for voice and string quartet (1908), &quot;Eglogue d&#x27;Automne&quot; for orchestra (1910), &quot;Vers la Princesse lointaine&quot;, a symphonic poem (1912), &quot;Aù printemps&quot; for voice and orchestra, and &quot;L&#x27;Arada&quot; (&quot;The Earth&quot;), a song cycle of six &quot;mélodies&quot; (1922).

Canteloube composed his first opera, &quot;Le mas&quot; (&quot;The Farmstead&quot; in Occitan language), to his own libretto, from 1910 to 1925, its composition delayed during the war years. The three-act work won the Prix Heugel in 1925, and was awarded the prize of 100,000 francs. However, the reaction to the composition by the leaders of the Opéra-Comique in Paris was far less enthusiastic than that of the jury. After pressure from the publisher, &quot;Le mas&quot; was finally premiered on 3 April 1929, but it was never revived. His second opera, &quot;Vercingétorix&quot;, in four acts, was inspired by a libretto by Étienne Clémentel, mayor of Riom (Puy-de-Dôme), and Hervé Louwyck, about the defeat of the Gauls by Julius Caesar. The Paris Opéra gave the first performance on 22 June 1933, but it was accused of lacking theatricality.

In 1925, along with several young Auvergnats in Paris, Canteloube founded a group called La Bourrée, who were eager to publicize the folklore and the beauty of their home region. Canteloube himself believed that &quot;peasant songs often rise to the level of purest art in terms of feeling and expression, if not in form&quot; (&quot;les chants paysans s’élèvent bien souvent au niveau de l&#x27;art le plus pur, par le sentiment et l&#x27;expression, sinon par la forme&quot;). He composed several song collections, which include &quot;Chants de Haute-Auvergne&quot;, albums of songs of Rouergue, Limousin, and Quercy, regional religious songs (&quot;Chants religieux d&#x27;Auvergne&quot;), and &quot;L&#x27;Hymne des Gaules&quot; based on a poem by Philius Lebesque. He also participated in the creation of the Bardic College of Gaul.

In 1941, he became associated with the government in Vichy France during the Nazi occupation, and wrote in the monarchist newspaper &quot;Action Française&quot;. With the tenor Christian Selva, he participated in numerous radio broadcasts of French folklore with his &quot;Songs of France&quot;. Radio was an ideal vehicle for disseminating regional popular music.

Alongside his career as a composer, Canteloube worked as a musicologist, collecting traditional French folksongs, which were published by Didier and Heugel. He also wrote biographies of Vincent d&#x27;Indy (1949) and of his friend Déodat de Séverac (1950).

Canteloube took more than thirty years (1924 to 1955) to complete the compilation of his most admired and famous collection of songs, &quot;Chants d&#x27;Auvergne&quot;. The passionate songs reflect the landscapes of the Auvergne in lush orchestral colors, and have enabled French folklore and rustic melodies to become better known.

He died in Grigny, Essonne, in 1957, aged 78.

<doc id="191117" wikidata="Q622216" url="?curid=191117" title="Patriarch of Alexandria">
<text>The Patriarch of Alexandria is the archbishop of Alexandria, Egypt. Historically, this office has included the designation &quot;pope&quot; (etymologically &quot;Father&quot;, like &quot;Abbot&quot;).

The Alexandrian episcopate was revered as one of the three major episcopal sees (along with Rome and Antioch) before Constantinople and Jerusalem were granted similar status (in 381 and 451, respectively). Alexandria was elevated to &quot;de facto&quot; archiepiscopal status by the Councils of Alexandria, and this status was ratified by Canon Six of the First Council of Nicaea, which stipulated that all the Egyptian episcopal provinces were subject to the metropolitan see of Alexandria In the sixth century, these five archbishops were formally granted the title of &quot;patriarch&quot; and were subsequently known as the Pentarchy.

Due to several schisms within Christianity, the title of the Patriarch of Alexandria is currently claimed by different churches (two of which are part of the Catholic Church) and held respectively by four persons: the Coptic Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria, the Coptic Catholic Patriarchate of Alexandria, the Melkite Patriarch of Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and all the East, and the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria. Each of the respective churches consider their patriarch as the successor to the original early bishops of Alexandria. The title was also previously held by the Latin Patriarch of Alexandria. The vast majority of the population of Christians within Alexandria and Egypt, as well as almost all of the Egyptian monastic communities, are part of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria.

==History==
According to church tradition, the patriarchate was founded in 42 AD by Mark the Evangelist. It was the centre from which Christianity spread throughout all Egypt. Within its jurisdiction, during its most flourishing period, were included about 108 bishops; its territory embraced the six provinces of Libya Superior, Libya Inferior, the Thebaid, Egypt, Heptanomis, and Augustamnica. In the beginning the successor of St. Mark was the only metropolitan bishop, and he governed ecclesiastically the entire territory. As the Christians multiplied, and other metropolitan sees were created, he became known the arch-metropolitan. The title of patriarch did not come into use until the fifth century.

Up to the time of the First Council of Constantinople (381) the Patriarch of Alexandria ranked next to the Bishop of Rome. By the third canon of this council, afterwards confirmed by the twenty-eighth canon of the Council of Chalcedon (451), the Patriarch of Constantinople, supported by imperial authority and by a variety of concurring advantages, was given the right of precedency over the Patriarch of Alexandria. But neither Rome nor Alexandria recognized the claim until many years later. During the first two centuries of our era, though Egypt enjoyed unusual quiet, little is known of the ecclesiastical history of its chief see, beyond a barren list of the names of its patriarchs, handed down to us chiefly through the church historian Eusebius.

All denominations acknowledge the succession of church leaders until the time of the Second Council of Ephesus of 449 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which gave rise to the non-Chalcedonian Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the Chalcedonian Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria.

==Pope==
This office has historically held the title of Pope—Πάπας (&quot;Papas&quot;), which means &quot;Father&quot; in Greek and Coptic—since Pope Heraclas of Alexandria, the 13th Alexandrine Bishop (227–248), was the first to associate &quot;Pope&quot; with the title of the Bishop of Alexandria.

The word &quot;pope&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;πάππας&quot; &quot;father&quot;. In the early centuries of Christianity, this title was applied informally (especially in the east) to all bishops and other senior clergy. In the west it began to be used particularly for the Bishop of Rome (rather than for bishops in general) in the sixth century; in 1075, Pope Gregory VII issued a declaration widely interpreted as stating this by-then-established convention. By the sixth century, this was also the normal practice in the imperial chancery of Constantinople.

The earliest record of this title was regarding Pope Heraclas of Alexandria (227–240) in a letter written by his successor, Pope Dionysius of Alexandria, to Philemon (a Roman presbyter): &quot;τοῦτον ἐγὼ τὸν κανόνα καὶ τὸν τύπον παρὰ τοῦ μακαρίου πάπα ἡμῶν Ἡρακλᾶ παρέλαβον.&quot; This is translated, &quot;I received this rule and ordinance from our blessed father/pope, Heraclas.&quot; According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest recorded use of &quot;pope&quot; in English is in an Old English translation (&quot;c&quot;. 950) of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, &quot;Þa wæs in þa tid Uitalius papa þæs apostolican seðles aldorbiscop.&quot; In modern English, &quot;At that time, Pope Vitalian was chief bishop of the apostolic see.&quot;

== Claimants to the title==

<text>An allemande (&quot;allemanda&quot;, &quot;almain(e)&quot;, or &quot;alman(d)&quot;, French: &quot;German (dance)&quot;) is a Renaissance and Baroque dance, and one of the most common instrumental dance styles in Baroque music, with examples by Couperin, Purcell, Bach and Handel. It is often the first movement of a Baroque suite of dances, paired with a subsequent courante, though it is sometimes preceded by an introduction or prelude. Along with the waltz and ländler, the allemande was sometimes referred to by the generic term German Dance in publications during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

A quite different, later, Allemande, named as such in the time of Mozart and Beethoven, still survives in Germany and Switzerland and is a lively triple-time social dance related to the waltz and the &quot;Ländler&quot;.

The name &quot;Allemande&quot; comes from the name of Germany in French.

==History==

The allemande originated in the 16th century as a duple metre dance of moderate tempo, already considered very old, with a characteristic &quot;double-knocking&quot; upbeat of two or occasionally three sixteenth notes. It appears to have derived from a German dance but no identifiable dance and no German dance instructions from this era survive.

The 16th-century French dancing master Thoinot Arbeau and the British Inns of Court therefore preserve the first records of the allemande, in which dancers formed a line of couples who took hands and walked the length of the room, walking three steps then balancing on one foot. A livelier version, the &quot;allemande courante&quot;, used three springing steps and a hop. Elizabethan British composers wrote many &quot;Almans&quot; as separate pieces.

French composers of the 17th century experimented with the allemande, shifting to quadruple meter and ranging more widely in tempo. This slower allemande, like the pavane, was adapted to the &quot;tombeau&quot; or memorial composition. The German composers Froberger and Bach followed suit in their allemandes for keyboard instruments, although ensemble allemandes kept a more traditional style. Italian and English composers were more free with the allemande, writing in counterpoint and using a variety of tempi (Corelli wrote allemandes ranging from &quot;largo&quot; to &quot;presto&quot;).

In his &quot;Musikalisches Lexicon&quot; (Leipzig, 1732), Johann Gottfried Walther wrote that the allemande &quot;must be composed and likewise danced in a grave and ceremonious manner.&quot; Likewise in &quot;Der Vollkommene Capellmeister&quot; (Hamburg, 1739) Johann Mattheson described the allemande as &quot;a serious and well-composed harmoniousness in arpeggiated style, expressing satisfaction or amusement, and delighting in order and calm&quot;. Its music is characterised by absence of syncopation, combination of short motifs into larger units and contrasts of tone and motif.

Some of the close embraces and turns of the allemande were carried over to square dance and contra dance. In an allemande, couples hold one forearm and turn around each other to the left or right.

==Triple meter dance==
Late in the 18th century, &quot;allemande&quot; or &quot;German Dance&quot; came to be used for another type of dance in triple meter. Weber&#x27;s &quot;Douze allemandes&quot; op. 4 of 1801 anticipate the waltz. Mozart and Beethoven both produced sets of German Dances in this style. A different version went on to become the Ländler.

<text>In physics, Planck&#x27;s law (also Planck radiation law) describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature , when there is no net flow of matter or energy between the body and its environment.

At the end of the 19th century, physicists were unable to explain why the observed spectrum of black-body radiation, which by then had been accurately measured, diverged significantly at higher frequencies from that predicted by existing theories. In 1900, German physicist Max Planck heuristically derived a formula for the observed spectrum by assuming that a hypothetical electrically charged oscillator in a cavity that contained black-body radiation could only change its energy in a minimal increment, , that was proportional to the frequency of its associated electromagnetic wave. While Planck originally regarded the hypothesis of dividing energy into increments as a mathematical artifice, introduced merely to get the correct answer, other physicists including Albert Einstein built on his work, and Planck&#x27;s insight is now recognized to be of fundamental importance to quantum theory.

== The law ==
Every physical body spontaneously and continuously emits electromagnetic radiation and the spectral radiance of a body, , describes the spectral emissive power per unit area, per unit solid angle and per unit frequency for particular radiation frequencies. The relationship given by Planck&#x27;s radiation law, given below, shows that with increasing temperature, the total radiated energy of a body increases and the peak of the emitted spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths. According to Planck&#x27;s distribution law, the spectral energy density (energy per unit volume per unit frequency) at given temperature is given by:formula_1alternatively, the law can be expressed for the spectral radiance of a body for frequency at absolute temperature 
given as:formula_2where is the Boltzmann constant, is the Planck constant, and is the speed of light in the medium, whether material or vacuum. The cgs units of spectral radiance are . The terms and are related to each other by a factor of since is independent of direction and radiation travels at speed .
The spectral radiance can also be expressed per unit wavelength instead of per unit frequency. In addition, the law may be expressed in other terms, such as the number of photons emitted at a certain wavelength, or the energy density in a volume of radiation.

In the limit of low frequencies (i.e. long wavelengths), Planck&#x27;s law tends to the Rayleigh–Jeans law, while in the limit of high frequencies (i.e. small wavelengths) it tends to the Wien approximation.

Max Planck developed the law in 1900 with only empirically determined constants, and later showed that, expressed as an energy distribution, it is the unique stable distribution for radiation in thermodynamic equilibrium. As an energy distribution, it is one of a family of thermal equilibrium distributions which include the Bose–Einstein distribution, the Fermi–Dirac distribution and the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.

== Black-body radiation ==


A black-body is an idealised object which absorbs and emits all radiation frequencies. Near thermodynamic equilibrium, the emitted radiation is closely described by Planck&#x27;s law and because of its dependence on temperature, Planck radiation is said to be thermal radiation, such that the higher the temperature of a body the more radiation it emits at every wavelength.

Planck radiation has a maximum intensity at a wavelength that depends on the temperature of the body. For example, at room temperature (~), a body emits thermal radiation that is mostly infrared and invisible. At higher temperatures the amount of infrared radiation increases and can be felt as heat, and more visible radiation is emitted so the body glows visibly red. At higher temperatures, the body is bright yellow or blue-white and emits significant amounts of short wavelength radiation, including ultraviolet and even x-rays. The surface of the Sun (~) emits large amounts of both infrared and ultraviolet radiation; its emission is peaked in the visible spectrum. This shift due to temperature is called Wien&#x27;s displacement law.

Planck radiation is the greatest amount of radiation that any body at thermal equilibrium can emit from its surface, whatever its chemical composition or surface structure. The passage of radiation across an interface between media can be characterized by the emissivity of the interface (the ratio of the actual radiance to the theoretical Planck radiance), usually denoted by the symbol . It is in general dependent on chemical composition and physical structure, on temperature, on the wavelength, on the angle of passage, and on the polarization. The emissivity of a natural interface is always between and 1.

A body that interfaces with another medium which both has and absorbs all the radiation incident upon it is said to be a black body. The surface of a black body can be modelled by a small hole in the wall of a large enclosure which is maintained at a uniform temperature with opaque walls that, at every wavelength, are not perfectly reflective. At equilibrium, the radiation inside this enclosure is described by Planck&#x27;s law, as is the radiation leaving the small hole.

Just as the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution is the unique maximum entropy energy distribution for a gas of material particles at thermal equilibrium, so is Planck&#x27;s distribution for a gas of photons. By contrast to a material gas where the masses and number of particles play a role, the spectral radiance, pressure and energy density of a photon gas at thermal equilibrium are entirely determined by the temperature.

If the photon gas is not Planckian, the second law of thermodynamics guarantees that interactions (between photons and other particles or even, at sufficiently high temperatures, between the photons themselves) will cause the photon energy distribution to change and approach the Planck distribution. In such an approach to thermodynamic equilibrium, photons are created or annihilated in the right numbers and with the right energies to fill the cavity with a Planck distribution until they reach the equilibrium temperature. It is as if the gas is a mixture of sub-gases, one for every band of wavelengths, and each sub-gas eventually attains the common temperature.

The quantity is the spectral radiance as a function of temperature and frequency. It has units of W·m−2·sr−1·Hz−1 in the SI system. An infinitesimal amount of power is radiated in the direction described by the angle from the surface normal from infinitesimal surface area into infinitesimal solid angle in an infinitesimal frequency band of width centered on frequency . The total power radiated into any solid angle is the integral of over those three quantities, and is given by the Stefan–Boltzmann law. The spectral radiance of Planckian radiation from a black body has the same value for every direction and angle of polarization, and so the black body is said to be a Lambertian radiator.

== Different forms ==
Planck&#x27;s law can be encountered in several forms depending on the conventions and preferences of different scientific fields. The various forms of the law for spectral radiance are summarized in the table below. Forms on the left are most often encountered in experimental fields, while those on the right are most often encountered in theoretical fields.

In the fractional bandwidth formulation, and the integration is with respect to 

Planck&#x27;s law can also be written in terms of the spectral energy density () by multiplying by :formula_3
These distributions represent the spectral radiance of blackbodies—the power emitted from the emitting surface, per unit projected area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, per spectral unit (frequency, wavelength, wavenumber or their angular equivalents, or fractional frequency or wavelength). Since the radiance is isotropic (i.e. independent of direction), the power emitted at an angle to the normal is proportional to the projected area, and therefore to the cosine of that angle as per Lambert&#x27;s cosine law, and is unpolarized.
=== Correspondence between spectral variable forms ===
Different spectral variables require different corresponding forms of expression of the law. In general, one may not convert between the various forms of Planck&#x27;s law simply by substituting one variable for another, because this would not take into account that the different forms have different units. Wavelength and frequency units are reciprocal.

Corresponding forms of expression are related because they express one and the same physical fact: for a particular physical spectral increment, a corresponding particular physical energy increment is radiated.

This is so whether it is expressed in terms of an increment of frequency, , or, correspondingly, of wavelength, , or of fractional bandwidth, or . Introduction of a minus sign can indicate that an increment of frequency corresponds with decrement of wavelength.

In order to convert the corresponding forms so that they express the same quantity in the same units we multiply by the spectral increment. Then, for a particular spectral increment, the particular physical energy increment may be written
formula_4
which leads to
formula_5

Also, , so that . Substitution gives the correspondence between the frequency and wavelength forms, with their different dimensions and units.
Consequently,
formula_6

Evidently, the location of the peak of the spectral distribution for Planck&#x27;s law depends on the choice of spectral variable. Nevertheless, in a manner of speaking, this formula means that the shape of the spectral distribution is independent of temperature, according to Wien&#x27;s displacement law, as detailed below in &quot;§ Properties §§ Percentiles&quot;.

The fractional bandwidth form is related to the other forms by
: formula_7.

=== First and second radiation constants ===
In the above variants of Planck&#x27;s law, the &quot;wavelength&quot; and &quot;wavenumber&quot; variants use the terms and which comprise physical constants only. Consequently, these terms can be considered as physical constants themselves, and are therefore referred to as the first radiation constant and the second radiation constant with

Using the radiation constants, the &quot;wavelength&quot; variant of Planck&#x27;s law can be simplified to
formula_8
and the &quot;wavenumber&quot; variant can be simplified correspondingly.

 is used here instead of because it is the SI symbol for &quot;spectral radiance&quot;. The in refers to that. This reference is necessary because Planck&#x27;s law can be reformulated to give spectral radiant exitance rather than &quot;spectral radiance&quot; , in which case replaces , with

so that Planck&#x27;s law for &quot;spectral radiant exitance&quot; can be written as
formula_9

As measuring techniques have improved, the General Conference on Weights and Measures has revised its estimate of ; see &quot;&quot; for details.

== Physics ==

Planck&#x27;s law describes the unique and characteristic spectral distribution for electromagnetic radiation in thermodynamic equilibrium, when there is no net flow of matter or energy. Its physics is most easily understood by considering the radiation in a cavity with rigid opaque walls. Motion of the walls can affect the radiation. If the walls are not opaque, then the thermodynamic equilibrium is not isolated. It is of interest to explain how the thermodynamic equilibrium is attained. There are two main cases: (a) when the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium is in the presence of matter, when the walls of the cavity are imperfectly reflective for every wavelength or when the walls are perfectly reflective while the cavity contains a small black body (this was the main case considered by Planck); or (b) when the approach to equilibrium is in the absence of matter, when the walls are perfectly reflective for all wavelengths and the cavity contains no matter. For matter not enclosed in such a cavity, thermal radiation can be approximately explained by appropriate use of Planck&#x27;s law.

Classical physics led, via the equipartition theorem, to the ultraviolet catastrophe, a prediction that the total blackbody radiation intensity was infinite. If supplemented by the classically unjustifiable assumption that for some reason the radiation is finite, classical thermodynamics provides an account of some aspects of the Planck distribution, such as the Stefan–Boltzmann law, and the Wien displacement law. For the case of the presence of matter, quantum mechanics provides a good account, as found below in the section headed Einstein coefficients. This was the case considered by Einstein, and is nowadays used for quantum optics. For the case of the absence of matter, quantum field theory is necessary, because non-relativistic quantum mechanics with fixed particle numbers does not provide a sufficient account.

=== Photons ===
Quantum theoretical explanation of Planck&#x27;s law views the radiation as a gas of massless, uncharged, bosonic particles, namely photons, in thermodynamic equilibrium. Photons are viewed as the carriers of the electromagnetic interaction between electrically charged elementary particles. Photon numbers are not conserved. Photons are created or annihilated in the right numbers and with the right energies to fill the cavity with the Planck distribution. For a photon gas in thermodynamic equilibrium, the internal energy density is entirely determined by the temperature; moreover, the pressure is entirely determined by the internal energy density. This is unlike the case of thermodynamic equilibrium for material gases, for which the internal energy is determined not only by the temperature, but also, independently, by the respective numbers of the different molecules, and independently again, by the specific characteristics of the different molecules. For different material gases at given temperature, the pressure and internal energy density can vary independently, because different molecules can carry independently different excitation energies.

Planck&#x27;s law arises as a limit of the Bose–Einstein distribution, the energy distribution describing non-interactive bosons in thermodynamic equilibrium. In the case of massless bosons such as photons and gluons, the chemical potential is zero and the Bose–Einstein distribution reduces to the Planck distribution. There is another fundamental equilibrium energy distribution: the Fermi–Dirac distribution, which describes fermions, such as electrons, in thermal equilibrium. The two distributions differ because multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state, while multiple fermions cannot. At low densities, the number of available quantum states per particle is large, and this difference becomes irrelevant. In the low density limit, the Bose–Einstein and the Fermi–Dirac distribution each reduce to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.

=== Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation ===
Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation is a succinct and brief account of a complicated physical situation. The following is an introductory sketch of that situation, and is very far from being a rigorous physical argument. The purpose here is only to summarize the main physical factors in the situation, and the main conclusions.

==== Spectral dependence of thermal radiation ====
There is a difference between conductive heat transfer and radiative heat transfer. Radiative heat transfer can be filtered to pass only a definite band of radiative frequencies.

It is generally known that the hotter a body becomes, the more heat it radiates at every frequency.

In a cavity in an opaque body with rigid walls that are not perfectly reflective at any frequency, in thermodynamic equilibrium, there is only one temperature, and it must be shared in common by the radiation of every frequency.

One may imagine two such cavities, each in its own isolated radiative and thermodynamic equilibrium. One may imagine an optical device that allows radiative heat transfer between the two cavities, filtered to pass only a definite band of radiative frequencies. If the values of the spectral radiances of the radiations in the cavities differ in that frequency band, heat may be expected to pass from the hotter to the colder. One might propose to use such a filtered transfer of heat in such a band to drive a heat engine. If the two bodies are at the same temperature, the second law of thermodynamics does not allow the heat engine to work. It may be inferred that for a temperature common to the two bodies, the values of the spectral radiances in the pass-band must also be common. This must hold for every frequency band. This became clear to Balfour Stewart and later to Kirchhoff. Balfour Stewart found experimentally that of all surfaces, one of lamp-black emitted the greatest amount of thermal radiation for every quality of radiation, judged by various filters.

Thinking theoretically, Kirchhoff went a little further and pointed out that this implied that the spectral radiance, as a function of radiative frequency, of any such cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium must be a unique universal function of temperature. He postulated an ideal black body that interfaced with its surrounds in just such a way as to absorb all the radiation that falls on it. By the Helmholtz reciprocity principle, radiation from the interior of such a body would pass unimpeded directly to its surroundings without reflection at the interface. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the thermal radiation emitted from such a body would have that unique universal spectral radiance as a function of temperature. This insight is the root of Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation.

==== Relation between absorptivity and emissivity ====
One may imagine a small homogeneous spherical material body labeled at a temperature , lying in a radiation field within a large cavity with walls of material labeled at a temperature . The body emits its own thermal radiation. At a particular frequency , the radiation emitted from a particular cross-section through the centre of in one sense in a direction normal to that cross-section may be denoted , characteristically for the material of . At that frequency , the radiative power from the walls into that cross-section in the opposite sense in that direction may be denoted , for the wall temperature . For the material of , defining the absorptivity as the fraction of that incident radiation absorbed by , that incident energy is absorbed at a rate .

The rate of accumulation of energy in one sense into the cross-section of the body can then be expressed
formula_10

Kirchhoff&#x27;s seminal insight, mentioned just above, was that, at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature , there exists a unique universal radiative distribution, nowadays denoted , that is independent of the chemical characteristics of the materials and , that leads to a very valuable understanding of the radiative exchange equilibrium of any body at all, as follows.

When there is thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature , the cavity radiation from the walls has that unique universal value, so that . Further, one may define the emissivity of the material of the body just so that at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature , one has .

When thermal equilibrium prevails at temperature , the rate of accumulation of energy vanishes so that . It follows that in thermodynamic equilibrium, when ,
formula_11

Kirchhoff pointed out that it follows that in thermodynamic equilibrium, when ,
formula_12

Introducing the special notation for the absorptivity of material at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature (justified by a discovery of Einstein, as indicated below), one further has the equality
formula_13
at thermodynamic equilibrium.

The equality of absorptivity and emissivity here demonstrated is specific for thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature and is in general not to be expected to hold when conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium do not hold. The emissivity and absorptivity are each separately properties of the molecules of the material but they depend differently upon the distributions of states of molecular excitation on the occasion, because of a phenomenon known as &quot;stimulated emission&quot;, that was discovered by Einstein. On occasions when the material is in thermodynamic equilibrium or in a state known as local thermodynamic equilibrium, the emissivity and absorptivity become equal. Very strong incident radiation or other factors can disrupt thermodynamic equilibrium or local thermodynamic equilibrium. Local thermodynamic equilibrium in a gas means that molecular collisions far outweigh light emission and absorption in determining the distributions of states of molecular excitation.

Kirchhoff pointed out that he did not know the precise character of , but he thought it important that it should be found out. Four decades after Kirchhoff&#x27;s insight of the general principles of its existence and character, Planck&#x27;s contribution was to determine the precise mathematical expression of that equilibrium distribution .

=== Black body ===

In physics, one considers an ideal black body, here labeled , defined as one that completely absorbs all of the electromagnetic radiation falling upon it at every frequency (hence the term &quot;black&quot;). According to Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation, this entails that, for every frequency , at thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature , one has , so that the thermal radiation from a black body is always equal to the full amount specified by Planck&#x27;s law. No physical body can emit thermal radiation that exceeds that of a black body, since if it were in equilibrium with a radiation field, it would be emitting more energy than was incident upon it.

Though perfectly black materials do not exist, in practice a black surface can be accurately approximated. As to its material interior, a body of condensed matter, liquid, solid, or plasma, with a definite interface with its surroundings, is completely black to radiation if it is completely opaque. That means that it absorbs all of the radiation that penetrates the interface of the body with its surroundings, and enters the body. This is not too difficult to achieve in practice. On the other hand, a perfectly black interface is not found in nature. A perfectly black interface reflects no radiation, but transmits all that falls on it, from either side. The best practical way to make an effectively black interface is to simulate an &#x27;interface&#x27; by a small hole in the wall of a large cavity in a completely opaque rigid body of material that does not reflect perfectly at any frequency, with its walls at a controlled temperature. Beyond these requirements, the component material of the walls is unrestricted. Radiation entering the hole has almost no possibility of escaping the cavity without being absorbed by multiple impacts with its walls.

=== Lambert&#x27;s cosine law ===
As explained by Planck, a radiating body has an interior consisting of matter, and an interface with its contiguous neighbouring material medium, which is usually the medium from within which the radiation from the surface of the body is observed. The interface is not composed of physical matter but is a theoretical conception, a mathematical two-dimensional surface, a joint property of the two contiguous media, strictly speaking belonging to neither separately. Such an interface can neither absorb nor emit, because it is not composed of physical matter; but it is the site of reflection and transmission of radiation, because it is a surface of discontinuity of optical properties. The reflection and transmission of radiation at the interface obey the Stokes–Helmholtz reciprocity principle.

At any point in the interior of a black body located inside a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature the radiation is homogeneous, isotropic and unpolarized. A black body absorbs all and reflects none of the electromagnetic radiation incident upon it. According to the Helmholtz reciprocity principle, radiation from the interior of a black body is not reflected at its surface, but is fully transmitted to its exterior. Because of the isotropy of the radiation in the body&#x27;s interior, the spectral radiance of radiation transmitted from its interior to its exterior through its surface is independent of direction.

This is expressed by saying that radiation from the surface of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium obeys Lambert&#x27;s cosine law. This means that the spectral flux from a given infinitesimal element of area of the actual emitting surface of the black body, detected from a given direction that makes an angle with the normal to the actual emitting surface at , into an element of solid angle of detection centred on the direction indicated by , in an element of frequency bandwidth , can be represented as
formula_14
where denotes the flux, per unit area per unit frequency per unit solid angle, that area would show if it were measured in its normal direction .

The factor is present because the area to which the spectral radiance refers directly is the projection, of the actual emitting surface area, onto a plane perpendicular to the direction indicated by . This is the reason for the name &quot;cosine law&quot;.

Taking into account the independence of direction of the spectral radiance of radiation from the surface of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium, one has and so
formula_15

Thus Lambert&#x27;s cosine law expresses the independence of direction of the spectral radiance of the surface of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium.

=== Stefan–Boltzmann law ===
The total power emitted per unit area at the surface of a black body () may be found by integrating the black body spectral flux found from Lambert&#x27;s law over all frequencies, and over the solid angles corresponding to a hemisphere () above the surface.
formula_16

The infinitesimal solid angle can be expressed in spherical polar coordinates:
formula_17
So that:
formula_18
where formula_19 is known as the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.

=== Radiative transfer ===
The equation of radiative transfer describes the way in which radiation is affected as it travels through a material medium. For the special case in which the material medium is in thermodynamic equilibrium in the neighborhood of a point in the medium, Planck&#x27;s law is of special importance.

For simplicity, we can consider the linear steady state, without scattering. The equation of radiative transfer states that for a beam of light going through a small distance , energy is conserved: The change in the (spectral) radiance of that beam () is equal to the amount removed by the material medium plus the amount gained from the material medium. If the radiation field is in equilibrium with the material medium, these two contributions will be equal. The material medium will have a certain emission coefficient and absorption coefficient.

The absorption coefficient is the fractional change in the intensity of the light beam as it travels the distance , and has units of length−1. It is composed of two parts, the decrease due to absorption and the increase due to stimulated emission. Stimulated emission is emission by the material body which is caused by and is proportional to the incoming radiation. It is included in the absorption term because, like absorption, it is proportional to the intensity of the incoming radiation. Since the amount of absorption will generally vary linearly as the density of the material, we may define a &quot;mass absorption coefficient&quot; which is a property of the material itself. The change in intensity of a light beam due to absorption as it traverses a small distance will then be
formula_20

The &quot;mass emission coefficient&quot; is equal to the radiance per unit volume of a small volume element divided by its mass (since, as for the mass absorption coefficient, the emission is proportional to the emitting mass) and has units of power⋅solid angle−1⋅frequency−1⋅density−1. Like the mass absorption coefficient, it too is a property of the material itself. The change in a light beam as it traverses a small distance will then be
formula_21

The equation of radiative transfer will then be the sum of these two contributions:
formula_22

If the radiation field is in equilibrium with the material medium, then the radiation will be homogeneous (independent of position) so that and:
formula_23
which is another statement of Kirchhoff&#x27;s law, relating two material properties of the medium, and which yields the radiative transfer equation at a point around which the medium is in thermodynamic equilibrium:
formula_24

=== Einstein coefficients ===
The principle of detailed balance states that, at thermodynamic equilibrium, each elementary process is equilibrated by its reverse process.

In 1916, Albert Einstein applied this principle on an atomic level to the case of an atom radiating and absorbing radiation due to transitions between two particular energy levels, giving a deeper insight into the equation of radiative transfer and Kirchhoff&#x27;s law for this type of radiation. If level 1 is the lower energy level with energy , and level 2 is the upper energy level with energy , then the frequency of the radiation radiated or absorbed will be determined by Bohr&#x27;s frequency condition:
formula_25

If and are the number densities of the atom in states 1 and 2 respectively, then the rate of change of these densities in time will be due to three processes:
; Spontaneous emission :
: formula_26
; Stimulated emission :
: formula_27
; Photo-absorption :
: formula_28
where is the spectral energy density of the radiation field. The three parameters , and , known as the Einstein coefficients, are associated with the photon frequency produced by the transition between two energy levels (states). As a result, each line in a spectrum has its own set of associated coefficients. When the atoms and the radiation field are in equilibrium, the radiance will be given by Planck&#x27;s law and, by the principle of detailed balance, the sum of these rates must be zero:
formula_29

Since the atoms are also in equilibrium, the populations of the two levels are related by the Boltzmann factor:
formula_30
where and are the multiplicities of the respective energy levels. Combining the above two equations with the requirement that they be valid at any temperature yields two relationships between the Einstein coefficients:
formula_31
formula_32
so that knowledge of one coefficient will yield the other two.

For the case of isotropic absorption and emission, the emission coefficient () and absorption coefficient () defined in the radiative transfer section above, can be expressed in terms of the Einstein coefficients. The relationships between the Einstein coefficients will yield the expression of Kirchhoff&#x27;s law expressed in the &quot;Radiative transfer&quot; section above, namely thatformula_33

These coefficients apply to both atoms and molecules.

== Properties ==

=== Peaks ===

The distributions , , and peak at a photon energy offormula_34where is the Lambert W function and is Euler&#x27;s number.

However, the distribution peaks at a different energyformula_35The reason for this is that, as mentioned above, one cannot go from (for example) to simply by substituting by . In addition, one must also multiply by formula_36, which shifts the peak of the distribution to higher energies. These peaks are the &quot;mode&quot; energy of a photon, when binned using equal-size bins of frequency or wavelength, respectively. Dividing () by these energy expression gives the wavelength of the peak.

The spectral radiance at these peaks is given by:
: formula_37
with formula_38 andformula_39with formula_40

Meanwhile, the &quot;average&quot; energy of a photon from a blackbody isformula_41where formula_42 is the Riemann zeta function.

=== Approximations ===

In the limit of low frequencies (i.e. long wavelengths), Planck&#x27;s law becomes the Rayleigh–Jeans law
formula_43
or
formula_44

The radiance increases as the square of the frequency, illustrating the ultraviolet catastrophe. In the limit of high frequencies (i.e. small wavelengths) Planck&#x27;s law tends to the Wien approximation:
formula_45 or formula_46

=== Percentiles ===
Wien&#x27;s displacement law in its stronger form states that the shape of Planck&#x27;s law is independent of temperature. It is therefore possible to list the percentile points of the total radiation as well as the peaks for wavelength and frequency, in a form which gives the wavelength when divided by temperature . The second column of the following table lists the corresponding values of , that is, those values of for which the wavelength is micrometers at the radiance percentile point given by the corresponding entry in the first column.

That is, 0.01% of the radiation is at a wavelength below  μm, 20% below , etc. The wavelength and frequency peaks are in bold and occur at 25.0% and 64.6% respectively. The 41.8% point is the wavelength-frequency-neutral peak (i.e. the peak in power per unit change in logarithm of wavelength or frequency). These are the points at which the respective Planck-law functions , and , respectively, divided by attain their maxima. The much smaller gap in ratio of wavelengths between 0.1% and 0.01% (1110 is 22% more than 910) than between 99.9% and 99.99% (113374 is 120% more than 51613) reflects the exponential decay of energy at short wavelengths (left end) and polynomial decay at long.

Which peak to use depends on the application. The conventional choice is the wavelength peak at 25.0% given by Wien&#x27;s displacement law in its weak form. For some purposes the median or 50% point dividing the total radiation into two-halves may be more suitable. The latter is closer to the frequency peak than to the wavelength peak because the radiance drops exponentially at short wavelengths and only polynomially at long. The neutral peak occurs at a shorter wavelength than the median for the same reason.


==== Comparison to solar spectrum ====
Solar radiation can be compared to black-body radiation at about 5778 K (but see graph). The table on the right shows how the radiation of a black body at this temperature is partitioned, and also how sunlight is partitioned for comparison. Also for comparison a planet modeled as a black body is shown, radiating at a nominal 288 K (15 °C) as a representative value of the Earth&#x27;s highly variable temperature. Its wavelengths are more than twenty times that of the Sun, tabulated in the third column in micrometers (thousands of nanometers).

That is, only 1% of the Sun&#x27;s radiation is at wavelengths shorter than 296 nm, and only 1% at longer than 3728 nm. Expressed in micrometers this puts 98% of the Sun&#x27;s radiation in the range from 0.296 to 3.728 μm. The corresponding 98% of energy radiated from a 288 K planet is from 5.03 to 79.5 μm, well above the range of solar radiation (or below if expressed in terms of frequencies instead of wavelengths ).

A consequence of this more-than-order-of-magnitude difference in wavelength between solar and planetary radiation is that filters designed to pass one and block the other are easy to construct. For example, windows fabricated of ordinary glass or transparent plastic pass at least 80% of the incoming 5778 K solar radiation, which is below 1.2 μm in wavelength, while blocking over 99% of the outgoing 288 K thermal radiation from 5 μm upwards, wavelengths at which most kinds of glass and plastic of construction-grade thickness are effectively opaque.

The Sun&#x27;s radiation is that arriving at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). As can be read from the table, radiation below 400 nm, or ultraviolet, is about 8%, while that above 700 nm, or infrared, starts at about the 48% point and so accounts for 52% of the total. Hence only 40% of the TOA insolation is visible to the human eye. The atmosphere shifts these percentages substantially in favor of visible light as it absorbs most of the ultraviolet and significant amounts of infrared.

=== Photon gas ===

Consider a cube of side with conducting walls filled with electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium at temperature . If there is a small hole in one of the walls, the radiation emitted from the hole will be characteristic of a perfect black body. We will first calculate the spectral energy density within the cavity and then determine the spectral radiance of the emitted radiation.

At the walls of the cube, the parallel component of the electric field and the orthogonal component of the magnetic field must vanish. Analogous to the wave function of a particle in a box, one finds that the fields are superpositions of periodic functions. The three wavelengths , , and , in the three directions orthogonal to the walls can be:formula_47where the are positive integers. For each set of integers there are two linearly independent solutions (known as modes). The two modes for each set of these correspond to the two polarization states of the photon which has a spin of 1. According to quantum theory, the total energy of a mode is given by:
The number can be interpreted as the number of photons in the mode. For the energy of the mode is not zero. This vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field is responsible for the Casimir effect. In the following we will calculate the internal energy of the box at absolute temperature .

According to statistical mechanics, the equilibrium probability distribution over the energy levels of a particular mode is given by:formula_48where we use the reciprocal temperatureformula_49The denominator , is the partition function of a single mode. It makes properly normalized, and can be evaluated asformula_50with
being the energy of a single photon. The average energy in a mode can be obtained from the partition function:formula_51This formula, apart from the first vacuum energy term, is a special case of the general formula for particles obeying Bose–Einstein statistics. Since there is no restriction on the total number of photons, the chemical potential is zero.

If we measure the energy relative to the ground state, the total energy in the box follows by summing over all allowed single photon states. This can be done exactly in the thermodynamic limit as approaches infinity. In this limit, becomes continuous and we can then integrate over this parameter. To calculate the energy in the box in this way, we need to evaluate how many photon states there are in a given energy range. If we write the total number of single photon states with energies between and as , where is the density of states (which is evaluated below), then the total energy is given by
To calculate the density of states we rewrite equation () as follows:formula_52where is the norm of the vector .

For every vector with integer components larger than or equal to zero, there are two photon states. This means that the number of photon states in a certain region of -space is twice the volume of that region. An energy range of corresponds to shell of thickness in -space. Because the components of have to be positive, this shell spans an octant of a sphere. The number of photon states , in an energy range , is thus given by:formula_53Inserting this in Eq. () and dividing by volume gives the total energy densityformula_54where the frequency-dependent spectral energy density is given byformula_55Since the radiation is the same in all directions, and propagates at the speed of light, the spectral radiance of radiation exiting the small hole isformula_56which yields the Planck&#x27;s lawformula_57Other forms of the law can be obtained by change of variables in the total energy integral. The above derivation is based on .

=== Dipole approximation and Einstein Coefficients ===
For the non-degenerate case, A and B coefficients can be calculated using dipole approximation in time dependent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. Calculation of A also requires second quantization since semi-classical theory cannot explain spontaneous emission which does not go to zero as perturbing field goes to zero. The transition rates hence calculated are (in SI units):
: formula_58
: formula_59
: formula_60

Note that the rate of transition formula depends on dipole moment operator. For higher order approximations, it involves quadrupole moment and other similar terms. The A and B coefficients (which correspond to angular frequency energy distribution) are hence:
: formula_61
: formula_62
where formula_63 and A and B coefficients satisfy the given ratios for non degenerate case:
: formula_64 and formula_65.

Another useful ratio is that from maxwell distribution which says that the number of particles in an energy level formula_66 is proportional to the exponent of formula_67. Mathematically:
: formula_68
where formula_69 and formula_70 are number of occupied energy levels of formula_71 and formula_72 respectively, where formula_73. Then, using: formula_74

Solving for formula_75 for equilibrium condition formula_76, and using the derived ratios, we get Planck&#x27;s Law:
: formula_77.

== History ==
=== Balfour Stewart ===
In 1858, Balfour Stewart described his experiments on the thermal radiative emissive and absorptive powers of polished plates of various substances, compared with the powers of lamp-black surfaces, at the same temperature. Stewart chose lamp-black surfaces as his reference because of various previous experimental findings, especially those of Pierre Prevost and of John Leslie. He wrote &quot;Lamp-black, which absorbs all the rays that fall upon it, and therefore possesses the greatest possible absorbing power, will possess also the greatest possible radiating power.&quot;

Stewart measured radiated power with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope. He was concerned with selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Helmholtz reciprocity principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium in which they had been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.

Stewart offered a theoretical proof that this should be the case separately for every selected quality of thermal radiation, but his mathematics was not rigorously valid. According to historian D. M. Siegel: &quot;He was not a practitioner of the more sophisticated techniques of nineteenth-century mathematical physics; he did not even make use of the functional notation in dealing with spectral distributions.&quot; He made no mention of thermodynamics in this paper, though he did refer to conservation of &quot;vis viva&quot;. He proposed that his measurements implied that radiation was both absorbed and emitted by particles of matter throughout depths of the media in which it propagated. He applied the Helmholtz reciprocity principle to account for the material interface processes as distinct from the processes in the interior material. He concluded that his experiments showed that, in the interior of an enclosure in thermal equilibrium, the radiant heat, reflected and emitted combined, leaving any part of the surface, regardless of its substance, was the same as would have left that same portion of the surface if it had been composed of lamp-black. He did not mention the possibility of ideally perfectly reflective walls; in particular he noted that highly polished real physical metals absorb very slightly.

=== Gustav Kirchhoff ===
In 1859, not knowing of Stewart&#x27;s work, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff reported the coincidence of the wavelengths of spectrally resolved lines of absorption and of emission of visible light. Importantly for thermal physics, he also observed that bright lines or dark lines were apparent depending on the temperature difference between emitter and absorber.

Kirchhoff then went on to consider bodies that emit and absorb heat radiation, in an opaque enclosure or cavity, in equilibrium at temperature .

Here is used a notation different from Kirchhoff&#x27;s. Here, the emitting power denotes a dimensioned quantity, the total radiation emitted by a body labeled by index at temperature . The total absorption ratio of that body is dimensionless, the ratio of absorbed to incident radiation in the cavity at temperature . (In contrast with Balfour Stewart&#x27;s, Kirchhoff&#x27;s definition of his absorption ratio did not refer in particular to a lamp-black surface as the source of the incident radiation.) Thus the ratio of emitting power to absorption ratio is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power, because is dimensionless. Also here the wavelength-specific emitting power of the body at temperature is denoted by and the wavelength-specific absorption ratio by . Again, the ratio of emitting power to absorption ratio is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power.

In a second report made in 1859, Kirchhoff announced a new general principle or law for which he offered a theoretical and mathematical proof, though he did not offer quantitative measurements of radiation powers. His theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid. His principle, however, has endured: it was that for heat rays of the same wavelength, in equilibrium at a given temperature, the wavelength-specific ratio of emitting power to absorption ratio has one and the same common value for all bodies that emit and absorb at that wavelength. In symbols, the law stated that the wavelength-specific ratio has one and the same value for all bodies, that is for all values of index . In this report there was no mention of black bodies.

In 1860, still not knowing of Stewart&#x27;s measurements for selected qualities of radiation, Kirchhoff pointed out that it was long established experimentally that for total heat radiation, of unselected quality, emitted and absorbed by a body in equilibrium, the dimensioned total radiation ratio , has one and the same value common to all bodies, that is, for every value of the material index . Again without measurements of radiative powers or other new experimental data, Kirchhoff then offered a fresh theoretical proof of his new principle of the universality of the value of the wavelength-specific ratio at thermal equilibrium. His fresh theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.

But more importantly, it relied on a new theoretical postulate of &quot;perfectly black bodies&quot;, which is the reason why one speaks of Kirchhoff&#x27;s law. Such black bodies showed complete absorption in their infinitely thin most superficial surface. They correspond to Balfour Stewart&#x27;s reference bodies, with internal radiation, coated with lamp-black. They were not the more realistic perfectly black bodies later considered by Planck. Planck&#x27;s black bodies radiated and absorbed only by the material in their interiors; their interfaces with contiguous media were only mathematical surfaces, capable neither of absorption nor emission, but only of reflecting and transmitting with refraction.

Kirchhoff&#x27;s proof considered an arbitrary non-ideal body labeled as well as various perfect black bodies labeled . It required that the bodies be kept in a cavity in thermal equilibrium at temperature . His proof intended to show that the ratio was independent of the nature of the non-ideal body, however partly transparent or partly reflective it was.

His proof first argued that for wavelength and at temperature , at thermal equilibrium, all perfectly black bodies of the same size and shape have the one and the same common value of emissive power , with the dimensions of power. His proof noted that the dimensionless wavelength-specific absorption ratio of a perfectly black body is by definition exactly 1. Then for a perfectly black body, the wavelength-specific ratio of emissive power to absorption ratio is again just , with the dimensions of power. Kirchhoff considered, successively, thermal equilibrium with the arbitrary non-ideal body, and with a perfectly black body of the same size and shape, in place in his cavity in equilibrium at temperature . He argued that the flows of heat radiation must be the same in each case. Thus he argued that at thermal equilibrium the ratio was equal to , which may now be denoted , a continuous function, dependent only on at fixed temperature , and an increasing function of at fixed wavelength , at low temperatures vanishing for visible but not for longer wavelengths, with positive values for visible wavelengths at higher temperatures, which does not depend on the nature of the arbitrary non-ideal body. (Geometrical factors, taken into detailed account by Kirchhoff, have been ignored in the foregoing.)

Thus Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation can be stated: &quot;For any material at all, radiating and absorbing in thermodynamic equilibrium at any given temperature &#x27;, for every wavelength &#x27;, the ratio of emissive power to absorptive ratio has one universal value, which is characteristic of a perfect black body, and is an emissive power which we here represent by &quot;&quot;.&quot; (For our notation , Kirchhoff&#x27;s original notation was simply .)

Kirchhoff announced that the determination of the function was a problem of the highest importance, though he recognized that there would be experimental difficulties to be overcome. He supposed that like other functions that do not depend on the properties of individual bodies, it would be a simple function. That function has occasionally been called &#x27;Kirchhoff&#x27;s (emission, universal) function&#x27;, though its precise mathematical form would not be known for another forty years, till it was discovered by Planck in 1900. The theoretical proof for Kirchhoff&#x27;s universality principle was worked on and debated by various physicists over the same time, and later. Kirchhoff stated later in 1860 that his theoretical proof was better than Balfour Stewart&#x27;s, and in some respects it was so. Kirchhoff&#x27;s 1860 paper did not mention the second law of thermodynamics, and of course did not mention the concept of entropy which had not at that time been established. In a more considered account in a book in 1862, Kirchhoff mentioned the connection of his law with &quot;Carnot&#x27;s principle&quot;, which is a form of the second law.

According to Helge Kragh, &quot;Quantum theory owes its origin to the study of thermal radiation, in particular to the &quot;blackbody&quot; radiation that Robert Kirchhoff had first defined in 1859–1860.&quot;

=== Empirical and theoretical ingredients for the scientific induction of Planck&#x27;s law ===
In 1860, Kirchhoff predicted experimental difficulties for the empirical determination of the function that described the dependence of the black-body spectrum as a function only of temperature and wavelength. And so it turned out. It took some forty years of development of improved methods of measurement of electromagnetic radiation to get a reliable result.

In 1865, John Tyndall described radiation from electrically heated filaments and from carbon arcs as visible and invisible. Tyndall spectrally decomposed the radiation by use of a rock salt prism, which passed heat as well as visible rays, and measured the radiation intensity by means of a thermopile.

In 1880, André-Prosper-Paul Crova published a diagram of the three-dimensional appearance of the graph of the strength of thermal radiation as a function of wavelength and temperature. He determined the spectral variable by use of prisms. He analyzed the surface through what he called &quot;isothermal&quot; curves, sections for a single temperature, with a spectral variable on the abscissa and a power variable on the ordinate. He put smooth curves through his experimental data points. They had one peak at a spectral value characteristic for the temperature, and fell either side of it towards the horizontal axis. Such spectral sections are widely shown even today.

In a series of papers from 1881 to 1886, Langley reported measurements of the spectrum of heat radiation, using diffraction gratings and prisms, and the most sensitive detectors that he could make. He reported that there was a peak intensity that increased with temperature, that the shape of the spectrum was not symmetrical about the peak, that there was a strong fall-off of intensity when the wavelength was shorter than an approximate cut-off value for each temperature, that the approximate cut-off wavelength decreased with increasing temperature, and that the wavelength of the peak intensity decreased with temperature, so that the intensity increased strongly with temperature for short wavelengths that were longer than the approximate cut-off for the temperature.

Having read Langley, in 1888, Russian physicist V.A. Michelson published a consideration of the idea that the unknown Kirchhoff radiation function could be explained physically and stated mathematically in terms of &quot;complete irregularity of the vibrations of ... atoms&quot;. At this time, Planck was not studying radiation closely, and believed in neither atoms nor statistical physics. Michelson produced a formula for the spectrum for temperature:
formula_78
where denotes specific radiative intensity at wavelength and temperature , and where and are empirical constants.

In 1898, Otto Lummer and Ferdinand Kurlbaum published an account of their cavity radiation source. Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck&#x27;s law. A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.

The importance of the Lummer and Kurlbaum cavity radiation source was that it was an experimentally accessible source of black-body radiation, as distinct from radiation from a simply exposed incandescent solid body, which had been the nearest available experimental approximation to black-body radiation over a suitable range of temperatures. The simply exposed incandescent solid bodies, that had been used before, emitted radiation with departures from the black-body spectrum that made it impossible to find the true black-body spectrum from experiments.

=== Planck&#x27;s views before the empirical facts led him to find his eventual law ===
Planck first turned his attention to the problem of black-body radiation in 1897.
Theoretical and empirical progress enabled Lummer and Pringsheim to write in 1899 that available experimental evidence was approximately consistent with the specific intensity law where and denote empirically measurable constants, and where and denote wavelength and temperature respectively. For theoretical reasons, Planck at that time accepted this formulation, which has an effective cut-off of short wavelengths.

Gustav Kirchhoff was Max Planck&#x27;s teacher and surmised that there was a universal law for blackbody radiation and this was called &quot;Kirchhoff&#x27;s challenge&quot;. Planck, a theorist, believed that Wilhelm Wien had discovered this law and Planck expanded on Wien&#x27;s work presenting it in 1899 to the meeting of the German Physical Society. Experimentalists Otto Lummer, Ferdinand Kurlbaum, Ernst Pringsheim Sr., and Heinrich Rubens did experiments that appeared to support Wien&#x27;s law especially at higher frequency short wavelengths which Planck so wholly endorsed at the German Physical Society that it began to be called the Wien-Planck Law. However, by September 1900, the experimentalists had proven beyond a doubt that the Wien-Planck law failed at the longer wavelengths. They would present their data on October 19. Planck was informed by his friend Rubens and quickly created a formula within a few days. In June of that same year, Lord Rayleigh had created a formula that would work for short lower frequency wavelengths based on the widely accepted theory of equipartition. So Planck submitted a formula combining both Rayleigh&#x27;s Law (or a similar equipartition theory) and Wien&#x27;s law which would be weighted to one or the other law depending on wavelength to match the experimental data. However, although this equation worked, Planck himself said unless he could explain the formula derived from a &quot;lucky intuition&quot; into one of &quot;true meaning&quot; in physics, it did not have true significance. Planck explained that thereafter followed the hardest work of his life. Planck did not believe in atoms, nor did he think the second law of thermodynamics should be statistical because probability does not provide an absolute answer, and Boltzmann&#x27;s entropy law rested on the hypothesis of atoms and was statistical. But Planck was unable to find a way to reconcile his Blackbody equation with continuous laws such as Maxwell&#x27;s wave equations. So in what Planck called &quot;an act of desperation&quot;, he turned to Boltzmann&#x27;s atomic law of entropy as it was the only one that made his equation work. Therefore, he used the Boltzmann constant &quot;k&quot; and his new constant &quot;h&quot; to explain the blackbody radiation law which became widely known through his published paper.

=== Finding the empirical law ===
Max Planck produced his law on 19 October 1900 as an improvement upon the Wien approximation, published in 1896 by Wilhelm Wien, which fit the experimental data at short wavelengths (high frequencies) but deviated from it at long wavelengths (low frequencies). In June 1900, based on heuristic theoretical considerations, Rayleigh had suggested a formula that he proposed might be checked experimentally. The suggestion was that the Stewart–Kirchhoff universal function might be of the form . This was not the celebrated Rayleigh–Jeans formula , which did not emerge until 1905, though it did reduce to the latter for long wavelengths, which are the relevant ones here. According to Klein, one may speculate that it is likely that Planck had seen this suggestion though he did not mention it in his papers of 1900 and 1901. Planck would have been aware of various other proposed formulas which had been offered. On 7 October 1900, Rubens told Planck that in the complementary domain (long wavelength, low frequency), and only there, Rayleigh&#x27;s 1900 formula fitted the observed data well.

For long wavelengths, Rayleigh&#x27;s 1900 heuristic formula approximately meant that energy was proportional to temperature, . It is known that and this leads to and thence to for long wavelengths. But for short wavelengths, the Wien formula leads to and thence to for short wavelengths. Planck perhaps patched together these two heuristic formulas, for long and for short wavelengths, to produce a formula
formula_79

This led Planck to the formula
formula_80
where Planck used the symbols and to denote empirical fitting constants.

Planck sent this result to Rubens, who compared it with his and Kurlbaum&#x27;s observational data and found that it fitted for all wavelengths remarkably well. On 19 October 1900, Rubens and Kurlbaum briefly reported the fit to the data, and Planck added a short presentation to give a theoretical sketch to account for his formula. Within a week, Rubens and Kurlbaum gave a fuller report of their measurements confirming Planck&#x27;s law. Their technique for spectral resolution of the longer wavelength radiation was called the residual ray method. The rays were repeatedly reflected from polished crystal surfaces, and the rays that made it all the way through the process were &#x27;residual&#x27;, and were of wavelengths preferentially reflected by crystals of suitably specific materials.

=== Trying to find a physical explanation of the law ===

Once Planck had discovered the empirically fitting function, he constructed a physical derivation of this law. His thinking revolved around entropy rather than being directly about temperature. Planck considered a cavity with perfectly reflective walls; inside the cavity, there are finitely many distinct but identically constituted resonant oscillatory bodies of definite magnitude, with several such oscillators at each of finitely many characteristic frequencies. These hypothetical oscillators were for Planck purely imaginary theoretical investigative probes, and he said of them that such oscillators do not need to &quot;really exist somewhere in nature, provided their existence and their properties are consistent with the laws of thermodynamics and electrodynamics.&quot;. Planck did not attribute any definite physical significance to his hypothesis of resonant oscillators but rather proposed it as a mathematical device that enabled him to derive a single expression for the black body spectrum that matched the empirical data at all wavelengths. He tentatively mentioned the possible connection of such oscillators with atoms. In a sense, the oscillators corresponded to Planck&#x27;s speck of carbon; the size of the speck could be small regardless of the size of the cavity, provided the speck effectively transduced energy between radiative wavelength modes.

Partly following a heuristic method of calculation pioneered by Boltzmann for gas molecules, Planck considered the possible ways of distributing electromagnetic energy over the different modes of his hypothetical charged material oscillators. This acceptance of the probabilistic approach, following Boltzmann, for Planck was a radical change from his former position, which till then had deliberately opposed such thinking proposed by Boltzmann. In Planck&#x27;s words, &quot;I considered the [quantum hypothesis] a purely formal assumption, and I did not give it much thought except for this: that I had obtained a positive result under any circumstances and at whatever cost.&quot; Heuristically, Boltzmann had distributed the energy in arbitrary merely mathematical quanta , which he had proceeded to make tend to zero in magnitude, because the finite magnitude had served only to allow definite counting for the sake of mathematical calculation of probabilities, and had no physical significance. Referring to a new universal constant of nature, , Planck supposed that, in the several oscillators of each of the finitely many characteristic frequencies, the total energy was distributed to each in an integer multiple of a definite physical unit of energy, , characteristic of the respective characteristic frequency. His new universal constant of nature, , is now known as the Planck constant.

Planck explained further that the respective definite unit, , of energy should be proportional to the respective characteristic oscillation frequency of the hypothetical oscillator, and in 1901 he expressed this with the constant of proportionality :
formula_81

Planck did not propose that light propagating in free space is quantized. The idea of quantization of the free electromagnetic field was developed later, and eventually incorporated into what we now know as quantum field theory.

In 1906, Planck acknowledged that his imaginary resonators, having linear dynamics, did not provide a physical explanation for energy transduction between frequencies. Present-day physics explains the transduction between frequencies in the presence of atoms by their quantum excitability, following Einstein. Planck believed that in a cavity with perfectly reflecting walls and with no matter present, the electromagnetic field cannot exchange energy between frequency components. This is because of the linearity of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Present-day quantum field theory predicts that, in the absence of matter, the electromagnetic field obeys nonlinear equations and in that sense does self-interact. Such interaction in the absence of matter has not yet been directly measured because it would require very high intensities and very sensitive and low-noise detectors, which are still in the process of being constructed. Planck believed that a field with no interactions neither obeys nor violates the classical principle of equipartition of energy, and instead remains exactly as it was when introduced, rather than evolving into a black body field. Thus, the linearity of his mechanical assumptions precluded Planck from having a mechanical explanation of the maximization of the entropy of the thermodynamic equilibrium thermal radiation field. This is why he had to resort to Boltzmann&#x27;s probabilistic arguments.

Planck&#x27;s law may be regarded as fulfilling the prediction of Gustav Kirchhoff that his law of thermal radiation was of the highest importance. In his mature presentation of his own law, Planck offered a thorough and detailed theoretical proof for Kirchhoff&#x27;s law, theoretical proof of which until then had been sometimes debated, partly because it was said to rely on unphysical theoretical objects, such as Kirchhoff&#x27;s perfectly absorbing infinitely thin black surface.

=== Subsequent events ===
It was not until five years after Planck made his heuristic assumption of abstract elements of energy or of action that Albert Einstein conceived of really existing quanta of light in 1905 as a revolutionary explanation of black-body radiation, of photoluminescence, of the photoelectric effect, and of the ionization of gases by ultraviolet light. In 1905, &quot;Einstein believed that Planck&#x27;s theory could not be made to agree with the idea of light quanta, a mistake he corrected in 1906.&quot; Contrary to Planck&#x27;s beliefs of the time, Einstein proposed a model and formula whereby light was emitted, absorbed, and propagated in free space in energy quanta localized in points of space. As an introduction to his reasoning, Einstein recapitulated Planck&#x27;s model of hypothetical resonant material electric oscillators as sources and sinks of radiation, but then he offered a new argument, disconnected from that model, but partly based on a thermodynamic argument of Wien, in which Planck&#x27;s formula played no role. Einstein gave the energy content of such quanta in the form . Thus Einstein was contradicting the undulatory theory of light held by Planck. In 1910, criticizing a manuscript sent to him by Planck, knowing that Planck was a steady supporter of Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity, Einstein wrote to Planck: &quot;To me it seems absurd to have energy continuously distributed in space without assuming an aether.&quot;

According to Thomas Kuhn, it was not till 1908 that Planck more or less accepted part of Einstein&#x27;s arguments for physical as distinct from abstract mathematical discreteness in thermal radiation physics. Still in 1908, considering Einstein&#x27;s proposal of quantal propagation, Planck opined that such a revolutionary step was perhaps unnecessary. Until then, Planck had been consistent in thinking that discreteness of action quanta was to be found neither in his resonant oscillators nor in the propagation of thermal radiation. Kuhn wrote that, in Planck&#x27;s earlier papers and in his 1906 monograph, there is no &quot;mention of discontinuity, [nor] of talk of a restriction on oscillator energy, [nor of] any formula like .&quot; Kuhn pointed out that his study of Planck&#x27;s papers of 1900 and 1901, and of his monograph of 1906, had led him to &quot;heretical&quot; conclusions, contrary to the widespread assumptions of others who saw Planck&#x27;s writing only from the perspective of later, anachronistic, viewpoints. Kuhn&#x27;s conclusions, finding a period till 1908, when Planck consistently held his &#x27;first theory&#x27;, have been accepted by other historians.

In the second edition of his monograph, in 1912, Planck sustained his dissent from Einstein&#x27;s proposal of light quanta. He proposed in some detail that absorption of light by his virtual material resonators might be continuous, occurring at a constant rate in equilibrium, as distinct from quantal absorption. Only emission was quantal. This has at times been called Planck&#x27;s &quot;second theory&quot;.

It was not till 1919 that Planck in the third edition of his monograph more or less accepted his &#x27;third theory&#x27;, that both emission and absorption of light were quantal.

The colourful term &quot;ultraviolet catastrophe&quot; was given by Paul Ehrenfest in 1911 to the paradoxical result that the total energy in the cavity tends to infinity when the equipartition theorem of classical statistical mechanics is (mistakenly) applied to black-body radiation. But this had not been part of Planck&#x27;s thinking, because he had not tried to apply the doctrine of equipartition: when he made his discovery in 1900, he had not noticed any sort of &quot;catastrophe&quot;. It was first noted by Lord Rayleigh in 1900, and then in 1901 by Sir James Jeans; and later, in 1905, by Einstein when he wanted to support the idea that light propagates as discrete packets, later called &#x27;photons&#x27;, and by Rayleigh and by Jeans.

In 1913, Bohr gave another formula with a further different physical meaning to the quantity . In contrast to Planck&#x27;s and Einstein&#x27;s formulas, Bohr&#x27;s formula referred explicitly and categorically to energy levels of atoms. Bohr&#x27;s formula was where and denote the energy levels of quantum states of an atom, with quantum numbers and . The symbol denotes the frequency of a quantum of radiation that can be emitted or absorbed as the atom passes between those two quantum states. In contrast to Planck&#x27;s model, the frequency formula_82 has no immediate relation to frequencies that might describe those quantum states themselves.

Later, in 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose developed the theory of the statistical mechanics of photons, which allowed a theoretical derivation of Planck&#x27;s law. The actual word &#x27;photon&#x27; was invented still later, by G.N. Lewis in 1926, who mistakenly believed that photons were conserved, contrary to Bose–Einstein statistics; nevertheless the word &#x27;photon&#x27; was adopted to express the Einstein postulate of the packet nature of light propagation. In an electromagnetic field isolated in a vacuum in a vessel with perfectly reflective walls, such as was considered by Planck, indeed the photons would be conserved according to Einstein&#x27;s 1905 model, but Lewis was referring to a field of photons considered as a system closed with respect to ponderable matter but open to exchange of electromagnetic energy with a surrounding system of ponderable matter, and he mistakenly imagined that still the photons were conserved, being stored inside atoms.

Ultimately, Planck&#x27;s law of black-body radiation contributed to Einstein&#x27;s concept of quanta of light carrying linear momentum, which became the fundamental basis for the development of quantum mechanics.

The above-mentioned linearity of Planck&#x27;s mechanical assumptions, not allowing for energetic interactions between frequency components, was superseded in 1925 by Heisenberg&#x27;s original quantum mechanics. In his paper submitted on 29 July 1925, Heisenberg&#x27;s theory accounted for Bohr&#x27;s above-mentioned formula of 1913. It admitted non-linear oscillators as models of atomic quantum states, allowing energetic interaction between their own multiple internal discrete Fourier frequency components, on the occasions of emission or absorption of quanta of radiation. The frequency of a quantum of radiation was that of a definite coupling between internal atomic meta-stable oscillatory quantum states. At that time, Heisenberg knew nothing of matrix algebra, but Max Born read the manuscript of Heisenberg&#x27;s paper and recognized the matrix character of Heisenberg&#x27;s theory. Then Born and Jordan published an explicitly matrix theory of quantum mechanics, based on, but in form distinctly different from, Heisenberg&#x27;s original quantum mechanics; it is the Born and Jordan matrix theory that is today called matrix mechanics. Heisenberg&#x27;s explanation of the Planck oscillators, as non-linear effects apparent as Fourier modes of transient processes of emission or absorption of radiation, showed why Planck&#x27;s oscillators, viewed as enduring physical objects such as might be envisaged by classical physics, did not give an adequate explanation of the phenomena.

Nowadays, as a statement of the energy of a light quantum, often one finds the formula , where , and denotes angular frequency, and less often the equivalent formula . This statement about a really existing and propagating light quantum, based on Einstein&#x27;s, has a physical meaning different from that of Planck&#x27;s above statement about the abstract energy units to be distributed amongst his hypothetical resonant material oscillators.

An article by Helge Kragh published in &quot;Physics World&quot; gives an account of this history.

Her 42 films during the 1930s and 1940s grossed more than $100 million, and for 10 consecutive years (1942–1951) she placed among the Quigley Poll&#x27;s top 10 box office stars (a feat only matched by Doris Day, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand, although all were surpassed by Mary Pickford, with 13 years). The U.S. Treasury Department listed her as the highest-salaried American woman in 1946 and 1947, and she earned more than $3 million during her career.

Grable began her film career in 1929 at age 12 and was later fired from a contract for having signed with a false identification. She studied acting with Neely Dickson at the Hollywood Community Theater. She had contracts with RKO and Paramount Pictures during the 1930s and appeared in a string of B movies, mostly portraying college students. She came to prominence in the Broadway musical &quot;Du Barry Was a Lady&quot; (1939), which brought her to the attention of 20th Century-Fox.

She replaced Alice Faye in &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; (1940), her first major Hollywood film, and became Fox&#x27;s biggest film star throughout the next decade. Fox cast Grable in a succession of Technicolor musicals during the decade that were immensely popular, costarring with such leading men as Victor Mature, Don Ameche, John Payne and Tyrone Power. In 1943, she was the number-one box-office draw in the world. Two of her greatest film successes were the musical &quot;Mother Wore Tights&quot; (1947) and the comedy &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (1953), one of her later films. Grable retired from screen acting in 1955 after she withdrew from her Fox contract, but she continued to perform on the stage and on television.

Throughout her career, Grable was a celebrated sex symbol. Her bathing-suit poster made her the top pin-up girl of World War II, surpassing Rita Hayworth. The photo was later included in the &quot;Life&quot; magazine project &quot;100 Photographs That Changed the World&quot;. Hosiery specialists of the era often noted the ideal proportions of Grable&#x27;s legs and thighs (), calf () and ankle (). Her legs were insured by her studio for $1 million as a publicity stunt. Describing her film career, Grable said: &quot;I became a star for two reasons, and I&#x27;m standing on them.&quot;

==Early life==
Grable was born on December 18, 1916, in St. Louis, Missouri, the youngest of three children of Lillian Rose (née Hofmann) and John Conn Grable, a stockbroker. Her second cousin was silent-film actress Virginia Pearson.

Her siblings were Marjorie Lucille Arnold (née Grable) and John Karl &quot;Jackie&quot; Grable. The Grable children were of Dutch, English, German, Swiss German and Irish ancestry. Nicknamed Betty as a child, she was pressured by her mother to become a performer. She was entered into multiple beauty contests, winning many and receiving considerable attention. Despite her success, she suffered from a fear of crowds and somnambulism.

==Career==
===Early career: 1929–1939===
A 12-year-old Grable and her mother travelled to Hollywood in 1929, shortly after the stock market crash. In Hollywood, Grable studied at the Hollywood Professional School and the Ernest Blecher Academy of Dance. To obtain jobs for her daughter, Lillian Grable lied about her daughter&#x27;s age, claiming that she was 15 to film producers and casting agents. That same year, she made her uncredited film debut as a chorus girl in the Fox Studios all-star revue &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1929). This success led to chorus-girl roles in &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Places&quot; (1930) and &quot;New Movietone Follies of 1930&quot; (1930).

In 1930, at age 13, Grable (under the pseudonym Frances Dean) signed with producer Samuel Goldwyn, thereby becoming one of the original Goldwyn Girls, along with Ann Sothern, Virginia Bruce, Claire Dodd and Paulette Goddard. As a member of the group, Grable appeared in a series of small parts in films, including the hit &quot;Whoopee!&quot; (1930), starring Eddie Cantor. Although she received no on-screen credit for her performance, she led the film&#x27;s opening musical number, titled &quot;Cowboys&quot;.
In 1932, aged 15, Grable signed a contract with RKO Radio Pictures, and she was assigned to a succession of acting, singing and dancing classes at the studio&#x27;s drama school. At age 14, her first film for the studio, &quot;Probation&quot; (1932), provided her first credited screen role. Over the next few years, she was again relegated to uncredited minor roles in a series of films, many of which became worldwide successes, such as &quot;Cavalcade&quot; (1933). She received larger roles in &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; (1934) and &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936).

After her brief stint as an RKO contract player, Grable signed with Paramount Pictures, which lent her to 20th Century-Fox to costar in the adolescent comedy &quot;Pigskin Parade&quot; (1936). Despite the studio&#x27;s effort to introduce Grable to the mainstream movie audience, her performance was overlooked by audiences and critics in favor of Judy Garland. When Grable returned to Paramount, she began a new phase in her career as the studio began casting her in a series of college-themed films in which she usually portrayed a naïve student, such as &quot;This Way Please&quot; (1937) and &quot;College Swing&quot; (1938). In 1939, she appeared opposite her husband Jackie Coogan in &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot;, a B-movie comedy that gave Grable her famous nickname.

When the film did not become the hit for which Paramount had hoped, the studio released her from her contract and Grable began preparing to leave Hollywood for a simpler life. However, she changed her mind and decided to try Broadway, accepting Buddy DeSylva&#x27;s offer to appear in his musical &quot;Du Barry Was a Lady&quot;, starring Ethel Merman and Bert Lahr. The play was an instant critical and audience success, and Grable was branded a newfound star.

===Breakthrough at Fox: 1940–1943===

In a 1940 interview, Grable stated she was &quot;sick and tired&quot; of show business and that she was considering retirement. Soon thereafter, she was invited to go on a personal appearance tour, which she readily accepted. The tour brought Grable to the attention of Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of 20th Century-Fox, who offered her a long-term contract. &quot;If that&#x27;s not luck, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;d call it&quot;, Grable said in her first interview after signing with the studio. Zanuck, who had been impressed by Grable&#x27;s performance in &quot;Du Barry Was a Lady&quot;, was, at the time, in the midst of casting the female lead in the musical film &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; (1940). The role had originally been assigned to Alice Faye, Fox&#x27;s most popular musical film star, but she had to decline the part due to an unspecified illness. After reviewing her screen test, Zanuck cast Grable as Faye&#x27;s replacement in the movie. The film was a lavish Technicolor musical and co-starred Don Ameche and Carmen Miranda. Grable&#x27;s performance of the song &quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; is considered a highlight of the film.

&quot;Down Argentine Way&quot; was a critical and box-office success at the time of its release, and many critics proclaimed Grable to be the successor to Alice Faye. The film&#x27;s success led to Grable&#x27;s casting in &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; (1940), co-starring Faye. As the Lily sisters, both Grable and Faye received favorable reviews for their performances. Over the years, rumors have circulated that a rivalry existed between Grable and Faye during filming, but this has been said to be entirely untrue—both actresses denied all accusations of a feud, and each often expressed their admiration for the other. The two reportedly remained friends until Grable&#x27;s death. After &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot;, Grable was teamed again with Ameche in the hit musical &quot;Moon Over Miami&quot; (1941), which co-starred up-and-coming actress Carole Landis.
In 1941, Fox attempted to broaden Grable&#x27;s acting and audience range by casting her in two films with more serious intent than those in which she had starred previously. The first, &quot;A Yank in the R.A.F.&quot;, released in September, co-starred heartthrob Tyrone Power, and cast her as Carol Brown, who works in the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force during the day, but is employed as a nightclub singer in the evening. The film followed the lines of other movies of the era, but it was not considered a propaganda movie by the studio. At the time of its release, the film received positive reviews, with many critics singling out the obvious on-screen chemistry between Grable and Power. It was a major box-office success, becoming the fourth-most popular movie of the year.

The second movie, &quot;I Wake Up Screaming&quot;, released in November, had Grable receiving top billing as Jill Lynn, the sister of a young model who is murdered. The film offered Grable her second teaming with Carole Landis, and it co-starred Victor Mature. Directed by H. Bruce Humberstone, the movie was a traditional black-and-white film noir, containing a combination of suspense and romance. Grable&#x27;s performance was reviewed favorably by most critics, and the film enjoyed reasonable financial success.
Grable&#x27;s star continued to rise when she starred in &quot;Song of the Islands&quot; (1942), co-starring Victor Mature and Jack Oakie. The success of the movie led to her re-teaming with Mature in &quot;Footlight Serenade&quot; (1942), also co-starring John Payne, in which she played a glamorous Broadway star. Fox then began to develop Philip Wylie&#x27;s short story &quot;Second Honeymoon&quot;, into a script suited for Grable&#x27;s talents. The resulting movie was &quot;Springtime in the Rockies&quot; (1942), directed by Irving Cummings, and the featured actors included Payne, Cesar Romero, Carmen Miranda, and her future husband, bandleader Harry James. The film was an immediate hit, Grable&#x27;s biggest success to date, grossing more than $2 million. The film&#x27;s success led to Fox increasing her salary and her having a wider choice over the films she made.

Grable was voted the number-one box-office draw by American movie exhibitors in 1943; she outranked Bob Hope, Gary Cooper, Greer Garson, Humphrey Bogart, and Clark Gable in popularity. &quot;Coney Island&quot;, released in June 1943, was a Technicolor &quot;gay nineties&quot; period musical and co-starred George Montgomery. The film earned more than $3.5 million at the box office and was well received by critics. &quot;Sweet Rosie O&#x27;Grady&quot; (1943), her follow-up feature, was equally successful at the box office, but it failed to obtain the same critical favor.

=== Frank Powolny poster and stardom: 1943–1949 ===
In 1943, she collaborated with photographer Frank Powolny for a regular studio photo session. During the shoot, she took several photos in a tight, one-piece bathing suit. One particular pose showed Grable&#x27;s back to the camera as she playfully smiled looking over her right shoulder. The picture was released as a poster and became the most requested photo for G.I.s stationed overseas. Grable&#x27;s photograph sold millions of copies, eventually surpassing the popularity of Rita Hayworth&#x27;s famous 1941 photo.

Grable&#x27;s success as a pin-up girl furthered her career as a mainstream movie star. As her star continued to ascend, Fox chief Darryl F. Zanuck expressed interest in broadening Grable&#x27;s range as an actress. Zanuck tried, on multiple occasions, to cast her in films that challenged her acting abilities, but Grable was reluctant; she felt insecure about her talent and this made her unwilling to accept roles she felt required too much of her. Zanuck relented to Grable&#x27;s own request not to tamper with her successful screen formula. As a result, the studio prepared a film called &quot;Pin Up Girl&quot; for her. The film has her as a hostess for a USO canteen who provides entertainment for the troops during their time there. The lavish musical used the pin-up photograph in many scenes, which boosted the photo&#x27;s sales. Many of the film&#x27;s later scenes had to be rewritten to hide Grable&#x27;s pregnancy. &quot;Pin Up Girl&quot; co-starred comedians Martha Raye and Joe E. Brown and was released in April 1944 to overwhelming success at the box office. Critics, though, were not as accepting of the film. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;makes no pretenses of ultra-realism&quot;, but also called it &quot;very pleasing and pleasant&quot;.

After time off to give birth to her daughter, Grable returned to Fox to star in &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Diamond Horseshoe&quot; (1945), co-starring Dick Haymes and Phil Silvers. Though the film earned more than $3 million at the box office, it struggled to make a profit because of its high production costs. &quot;The Dolly Sisters&quot; (1945), her next film, teamed her with newcomer June Haver, an actress Fox was promoting as Grable&#x27;s successor. Although the press hinted that a tense behind-the-scenes rivalry existed between the two actresses, they both denied it, claiming to be good friends. &quot;The Dolly Sisters&quot; earned more than $4 million at the box office and was Fox&#x27;s second-highest earning movie of the year, behind &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot;.

After five years of constant work, Grable was allowed time off for an extended vacation. She briefly returned to filming to make a cameo in &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; (1946), in which she appeared as a fan of her husband Harry James&#x27; character. Grable was reluctant to continue her film career, but Fox was desperately in need of her return. Without Grable&#x27;s movies, which generated large profits, the studio struggled to stay afloat. &quot;The Shocking Miss Pilgrim&quot; (1947) was her first film back at Fox. She played Cynthia Pilgrim, a college student who graduated at the top of her typewriting class during the first year of the Packard Business College. Although critics acknowledged that the film &quot;momentarily achieved&quot; brilliance, they also felt that the movie&#x27;s music was like &quot;sticky toothpaste being squeezed out of a tube&quot;. The film also suffered from indifferent ticket sales and lost money. Grable next starred in Walter Lang&#x27;s &quot;Mother Wore Tights&quot;, released in September 1947, co-starring Dan Dailey. The film told the story of two aging vaudeville performers as they look back on their heyday through a series of flashbacks. It received critical acclaim from critics and was a box-office hit, earning an estimated $5 million.

Grable was cast in &quot;That Lady in Ermine&quot; (1948), a film project that had previously been considered for either Jeanette MacDonald or Gene Tierney. It co-starred Douglas Fairbanks Jr and originally was directed by Ernst Lubitsch. After Lubitsch&#x27;s death early in production, Otto Preminger took over. It was reported that Grable often quarreled with Fairbanks and Preminger and that she nearly walked out on filming, but decided against it on the advice of her agent. When the film was released, it received mixed reviews; it was referred to as &quot;a bright and beguiling swatch of nonsense&quot; and it did not generate the revenue Fox had hoped. Grable immediately thereafter began filming &quot;When My Baby Smiles at Me&quot; (1948), co-starring Dan Dailey, which became a blockbuster, cementing Grable and Dailey&#x27;s status as a bankable movie duo. Closing the decade, Grable starred in &quot;The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend&quot; (1949), an oddball movie that unevenly mixed musical numbers with Western clichés. Despite a casting consisting of Cesar Romero and Rudy Vallée, the film was panned by critics, but it was a reasonable success at the box office.

===Decline and last films: 1950–1955===
Grable had been placed in the &quot;Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll&quot; every year, beginning in 1942. She ranked at the top of the poll in 1943, and ranked second in 1947 and 1948. In 1949, although she still placed in the top 10, she slipped from second to seventh place in popularity. Fox became concerned that Grable might be becoming regarded as passé. Darryl F. Zanuck had the film &quot;Wabash Avenue&quot; (1950) tailored to fit Grable&#x27;s talents. The film&#x27;s plot closely followed the story of Grable&#x27;s earlier hit &quot;Coney Island&quot; (1943). Despite the similarities, it had new songs written and dances choreographed to modernize the film. &quot;Wabash Avenue&quot; was released in May 1950, and was a box-office hit. &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot;, released in December 1950, re-teamed her with Dan Dailey, and was equally successful financially. In 1950, Grable had regained her status as the most-popular female at the box office; she ranked fourth overall, behind John Wayne, Bob Hope, and Bing Crosby.

Although, by the early 1950s, Grable was searching for originality in the scripts offered to her, she had no luck in finding the movies she wanted to do. She reluctantly agreed to make &quot;Call Me Mister&quot; (1951) with Dan Dailey, a loose musical remake of &quot;A Yank in the R.A.F.&quot;. The film was moderately successful and quickly was followed by &quot;Meet Me After the Show&quot; (1951), co-starring Macdonald Carey, Rory Calhoun, and Eddie Albert. It received favorable reviews from most critics and was a box-office success.

In 1952, Grable began re-negotiating her contract with Fox. She requested a higher salary and the option to make only those films she wanted to do. The studio refused, and she went on strike, which led to her being replaced by Marilyn Monroe in the movie adaptation of &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953) and by June Haver in the musical comedy &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; (also 1953). 

After a year off from filming, Grable reluctantly reconciled with Fox and agreed to star in a musical remake of &quot;The Farmer Takes a Wife&quot; (1953). The film was an attempt by Fox to recapture Grable&#x27;s reputation as the studio&#x27;s biggest star, and although she was paired with Dale Robertson, the film was a critical and box-office flop.

She next starred in &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;, a romantic comedy about three models plotting to marry wealthy men, co-starring Marilyn Monroe and Lauren Bacall. During production, Grable and Monroe falsely were rumored to be at odds with each other. Grable, whose career was declining, was assumed to be jealous of Monroe because she was being groomed as Fox&#x27;s newest star and possibly as Grable&#x27;s unofficial successor. In fact, Grable and Monroe got along famously; Grable reportedly told Monroe: &quot;Go and get yours, honey! I&#x27;ve had mine!&quot; &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; was a box-office triumph when released, grossing an estimated $8 million.
After refusing the leading female role in Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; (1954), Grable again was suspended from her contract. The following year, she appeared in &quot;Three for the Show&quot; (1955) for Columbia Pictures, her first film made away from Fox in over 15 years, and featuring up-and-coming actor Jack Lemmon and dancers Marge and Gower Champion. Critics called the film a &quot;slight, but cheerful, item&quot;, and proclaimed it &quot;does serve to bring Betty Grable back to the screen&quot;. It enjoyed reasonable success at the box office, particularly overseas. She agreed to make &quot;How to Be Very, Very Popular&quot; (1955) for Fox on the assurance Marilyn Monroe would be her co-star. When Monroe withdrew from the production, she was replaced with Sheree North. The release of the film was surrounded by a massive publicity campaign, but despite the promotion, the film failed to fulfill its hype, and critics complained of the lack of chemistry between Grable and North. It was, however, a box-office hit, earning more than $3.7 million. It proved to be Grable&#x27;s final film appearance. In 1955, she did attempt to return to acting in Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s film version of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1955). She opted to play the role of Miss Adelaide, but was passed over in favor of Vivian Blaine, who had played the role on Broadway. She then officially retired from motion-picture acting.

Grable thereafter found a new career starring in her own act in Las Vegas hotels and with her husband at the time, musician Harry James. Later, she starred in big Las Vegas stage productions such as &quot;Hello, Dolly&quot;. She also appeared on Broadway in &quot;Hello, Dolly&quot; in 1967.

==Personal life and death==
===Relationships===
Grable married former child actor Jackie Coogan in 1937. He was under considerable stress from a lawsuit against his parents over his childhood earnings, and the couple divorced in 1939.

In 1943, she married trumpeter Harry James. They had two daughters, Victoria Elizabeth &quot;Vicki&quot; James Bivens and Jessica James Yahner. Their marriage, which lasted for 22 years, was beset by alcoholism and infidelity, and they divorced in 1965.

Grable entered into a relationship with dancer Bob Remick, 27 years her junior, with whom she remained until she died in 1973.
===Death===
Grable died of lung cancer on July 2, 1973, at the age of 56 in Santa Monica, California.

Her funeral was held two days later and was attended by ex-husbands Jackie Coogan and Harry James as well as Hollywood stars Dorothy Lamour, Shirley Booth, Mitzi Gaynor, Don Ameche, Cesar Romero, George Raft, Alice Faye, Johnnie Ray and Dan Dailey. &quot;I Had the Craziest Dream&quot;, the ballad from &quot;Springtime in the Rockies&quot;, was played on the church organ.

She was entombed at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

<text>Fear Factory is an American industrial metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1989. Throughout the band&#x27;s career, they have released ten full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of sounds, all in their main style of industrial metal. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen frequent changes in its lineup, with lead vocalist Burton C. Bell being the only consistent member for 31 years until his departure in 2020. Guitarist Dino Cazares is the only original member still in the band. The band went on hiatus in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but resumed activity a year later without founding member Cazares. Previous bassist Christian Olde Wolbers replaced him on guitar, while Byron Stroud handled bass duties. After a second hiatus in 2006, Fear Factory reunited in April 2009 with a new lineup that featured a returning Cazares, Gene Hoglan as the replacement of original drummer Raymond Herrera, and Bell and Stroud reprising their respective roles; this lineup recorded the band&#x27;s seventh studio album titled &quot;Mechanize&quot; (2010). Wolbers and Herrera — together comprising 50% of the band&#x27;s legal ownership — disputed the legitimacy of the reunited band, and a legal battle from both parties had begun. Despite this, Fear Factory has since released three more albums: &quot;The Industrialist&quot; (2012), &quot;Genexus&quot; (2015) and &quot;Aggression Continuum&quot; (2021).

The band has performed at Ozzfest four times and the inaugural Gigantour. Their singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200, and they have sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone.

Fear Factory was formed in 1989 under the name Ulceration, which the band agreed would &quot;just be a cool name&quot;. In 1990, the name &quot;Fear the Factory&quot; was adopted. The name was inspired by a factory that the band supposedly saw near their rehearsal space which was guarded by men carrying rifles. Later, they shortened the name to just &quot;Fear Factory&quot;.

The band&#x27;s origins can be traced to an outfit formed by guitarist Dino Cazares—formerly of &quot;The Douche Lords&quot;—and drummer Raymond Herrera in Los Angeles, California. Their first lineup was completed with the addition of bassist Dave Gibney and vocalist Burton C. Bell (ex-&quot;Hate Face&quot;), who was allegedly recruited by an impressed Cazares, who overheard him singing &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; by U2. Cazares played bass on the first three Fear Factory albums &quot;Concrete&quot;, &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; and &quot;Demanufacture&quot;, on which Cazares changed many of the riffs during the recording. It took Cazares two weeks to get the appropriate guitar tone. Cazares created, wrote and recorded all the music on the album. Olde Wolbers joined the band two weeks before they were scheduled to go on tour to promote the album and, although he contributed musical changes to a couple of songs on the album he stated that these were not significant.

Fear Factory&#x27;s earliest demo recordings are strongly reminiscent of the early works of Napalm Death and Godflesh, an acknowledged influence of the band in the grindcore-driven approach of the former and the mechanical brutality, bleakness, and vocal stylings of the latter. According to Brian Russ of The BNR Metal Pages, the demos are remarkable for integrating these influences into the band&#x27;s death metal sound and for Burton C. Bell&#x27;s pioneering fusion of extreme death growls and clean vocals in the same song, which was to become a significant and influential element of the band&#x27;s sound throughout their career. The use of grunts and &quot;throat singing&quot; combined with clean vocals later defined the nu metal and other emerging subgenres of metal. Many vocalists in today&#x27;s metal scene use two or more methods of singing and vocalizing lyrics. The band contributed two songs to the &quot;L.A. Death Metal Compilation&quot; in 1990. The band played its first show on October 31, 1990.

In 1991, Fear Factory recorded a series of cuts with producer Ross Robinson in Blackie Lawless&#x27;s studio. Afterward, the band members was unhappy with the terms of their recording contract, and they refused to sign. The band retained the rights to the songs, many of which they re-recorded in 1992 with a different producer, Colin Richardson, for inclusion on their debut release &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;. Meanwhile, Ross Robinson obtained the rights to the recording, which he used to promote himself as a producer. The album was released in 2002 by Roadrunner Records under the title &quot;Concrete&quot; after the band&#x27;s breakup. The release was controversial because the album was issued without the approval of Fear Factory. Robinson ended up suing the band, which Bell jokingly said in 2021 that it was foreshadowing &quot;the entire career of Fear Factory.&quot; &quot;Concrete&quot; is viewed by the band as a demo; a developmental step toward &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;.

===&quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; (1992–1994)===

Fear Factory shopped the &quot;Concrete&quot; demo to various labels, and was rejected by a number of well-known metal record labels, such as Metal Blade, Earache, Nuclear Blast and Peaceville Records. Eventually, after presenting the demo to Max Cavalera, Max was so impressed that he recommended Fear Factory to A&amp;R representative Monte Conner, of the then-death-metal-focused Roadrunner Records label, which offered the band a recording contract. While the band signed the contract, it has since become controversial because of Roadrunner&#x27;s treatment of the band during the events surrounding its 2002 breakup. This was reflected in the first album &quot;Archetype&quot; (2004), which was released following the band&#x27;s re-formation. The opening song with lyrics by Burton C. Bell, &quot;Slave Labor&quot;, was direct about the band&#x27;s feelings on the matter. After working with numerous bassists, Andrew Shives was hired as a live bassist prior to the release of &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;.

Released in 1992, &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;, which was recorded with producer Colin Richardson, gave the band greater exposure in the music scene. The sound of the album presages the mixing of metal genres which would soon be called alternative metal. The production combined Bell&#x27;s harsh and melodic vocals, Herrera&#x27;s machine-like drums, the integrated industrial samples and textures and the sharp, down-tuned, rhythmic, death metal riffs of Dino Cazares. Cazares and Herrera wrote all the music. Because the band had no bass player, Cazares played both guitar and bass on the recording. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic called the album &quot;groundbreaking&quot; and said that &quot;it ushered in the &#x27;90s alternative metal era&quot;.

To promote the album, Fear Factory embarked on extensive U.S. tours with Biohazard, Sepultura, and Sick of It All. During this period, sampler-keyboardist Reynor Diego joined the group. An album tour of Europe with Brutal Truth, then Cannibal Corpse, Cathedral, and Sleep, followed. The next year, they hired Front Line Assembly member Rhys Fulber to remix some songs from the album, demonstrating the band&#x27;s willingness to experiment with their music. The results took on a predominantly industrial guise, and were released as the &quot;Fear Is the Mindkiller&quot; EP (1993). &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; and &quot;Fear is the Mindkiller&quot; were released (2004) as a package in a new re-mastered reissue by Roadrunner Records.

In 1994, Andrew Shives was forced to leave the band. Cazares recorded both the guitar and bass for the entire album. In November the same year, the band met Belgian Christian Olde Wolbers through Evan Seinfeld of Biohazard. Wolbers auditioned for Fear Factory&#x27;s permanent bassist. Wolbers joined the band immediately since the band&#x27;s tour was starting in two weeks.

===&quot;Demanufacture&quot; (1995–1997)===
In June 1995, the band participated at the Dynamo Open Air festival in Netherlands.

Fear Factory&#x27;s second album, &quot;Demanufacture&quot;, was released on June 12. Generally considered to be the band&#x27;s defining work, features an alternative metal sound characterized by a mix of rapid-fire thrash metal/industrial metal guitar riffs and tight, pulse driven drum beats, roaring (rather than growled, but still aggressive) vocals that made way for melodic singing and powerful bass lines. The album&#x27;s production is more refined and the integration of atmospheric keyboard parts and industrial textures upon Cazares&#x27; and Herrera&#x27;s precise musicianship made the songs sound clinical, cold and machine-like and gave the band&#x27;s music a futuristic feel. There were extensive contributions from Reynor Diego as well; adding key samples, loops and electronic flourishes to the group dynamics.

&quot;Demanufacture&quot; was awarded the maximum five-star rating in the UK&#x27;s &quot;Kerrang!&quot; rock magazine. It went on to become a fairly successful album; whereas &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; failed to chart anywhere, &quot;Demanufacture&quot; made the Top 10 of the Billboard Heatseekers charts and a video was produced for the song &quot;Replica&quot;. The video was featured in the &quot;Test Drive 5&quot; video game for the PlayStation. The song &quot;Zero Signal&quot; was featured on the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film soundtrack (1995). Instrumental versions of &quot;Demanufacture&quot; songs were later used in PC video games &quot;Carmageddon&quot; and &quot;Messiah&quot;.

Fear Factory spent the next few years touring with such bands Black Sabbath, Megadeth and Iron Maiden, and opened for Ozzy Osbourne in North America and Europe during late 1995. They went on their first headlining European tour in mid-1996, with Manhole and Drain S.T.H. playing in clubs and music festivals, such as With Full Force, Wâldrock or Graspop Metal Meeting. They also appeared at the Ozzfest in 1996 and 1997. In early 1997, they participated at the Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand. In May 1997, the band released a new album composed of &quot;Demanufacture&quot; remixes by artists such as Rhys Fulber, DJ Dano or Junkie XL called &quot;Remanufacture - Cloning Technology&quot;. This was the band&#x27;s first appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Roadrunner Records re-released, in a 10th Anniversary single package, &quot;Demanufacture&quot; and &quot;Remanufacture&quot; in 2005, which is similar to that of &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; (2004). This edition also includes bonus tracks from the digipak version of &quot;Demanufacture&quot; (1995).

===&quot;Obsolete&quot; (1998–2000)===
Fear Factory&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Obsolete&quot; (July 1998), was reportedly completed earlier than planned by canceling an appearance at the Dynamo Open Air Festival.

&quot;Obsolete&quot; was similar in sound to &quot;Demanufacture&quot;, emphasizing progressive metal elements. For the first time, the album featured Christian Olde Wolbers writing and recording full time with the band. It also featured Cazares&#x27; debut use of 7-string Ibanez guitars tuned to A tuning (A, D, G, C, F, A, D), and paved the way for a lower-tuned sound than previously. The album is also notable for Rhys Fulber&#x27;s increased involvement with the band.

While Fear Factory had explored the theme of &quot;Man versus Machine&quot; in their earlier work, &quot;Obsolete&quot; was their first concept album that dealt specifically with a literal interpretation of this subject. It tells a story called &quot;Conception 5&quot;, which was written by Bell, that takes place in a future world where mankind is rendered &quot;obsolete&quot; by machines. Its characters include the &quot;Edgecrusher&quot;, &quot;Smasher/Devourer&quot;, and the &quot;Securitron&quot; monitoring system. The story is presented in the lyrics booklet in a screenplay format between the individual songs. The printed story parts link the lyrics of the songs together thematically.

&quot;Obsolete&quot; was released during the alternative metal boom of the late 1990s. It was supported by tours with Slayer and later Rammstein, and a headlining spot on the second stage at Ozzfest in 1999 as last-minute replacements for Judas Priest. They also toured in Europe in December 1998 with Spineshank and Kilgore, and went on their first headlining tour in North America with Static-X the next year, though the first leg was interrupted due to the band&#x27;s tour bus and material being stolen. They also played in Japan for the first time. &quot;Obsolete&quot; became the band&#x27;s highest selling album, marking the band&#x27;s first entry into the Top 100 on the Billboard charts. The album also spawned singles &quot;Descent&quot; and a digipak bonus track, &quot;Cars&quot;, a cover of the Gary Numan song featuring a guest appearance by Numan on the song. The single made the Mainstream Rock Top 40 in 1999 and was also featured in the video game, Test Drive 6. Numan also performed a spoken-word sample on the album&#x27;s title track. A video was filmed for the song &quot;Resurrection&quot;. To date, &quot;Obsolete&quot; remains the only Fear Factory album to have achieved gold sales in the U.S.

===&quot;Digimortal&quot; and demise (2001–2002)===

In early 2001, Fear Factory was asked to headline SnoCore Rock. The success of &quot;Obsolete&quot; and &quot;Cars&quot; was a turning point for the band; Roadrunner Records was now keen on capitalizing on the band&#x27;s sales potential and pressured the band to record more accessible material for the follow-up album, titled &quot;Digimortal&quot;, which was released in April 2001. Few weeks before its release, they were touring in Europe with One Minute Silence.

They went on a long headlining North American tour during 2001, then played in much larger European festivals like Bizarre Festival, Pukkelpop, Lowlands Festival and Leeds &amp; Reading Festival. They then went on the first Roadrunner Roadrage tour in North America, toured Europe with Devin Townsend and Godflesh and played in Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

&quot;Digimortal&quot; made the Top 40 on the Billboard album charts, the Top 20 in Canada and the Top 10 of the Australian album charts. The track &quot;Linchpin&quot; reached the Mainstream Rock Top 40. A remix of &quot;Invisible Wounds&quot; was included on the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film soundtrack, and an instrumental digipak bonus track called &quot;Full Metal Contact&quot; was originally written for the video game, &quot;Demolition Racer&quot;. A VHS/DVD release called &quot;Digital Connectivity&quot;, which documents each of the four album periods of the band via interviews, live clips, music videos and tour/studio footage, was released in January 2002.

Although &quot;Digimortal&quot; had a successful start, the sales did not reach the levels of &quot;Obsolete&quot; and the band received little tour support. The direction of the album coupled with strong personal differences between some of the band members created a rift that escalated to the point where Bell announced his exit in March 2002. The band disbanded immediately thereafter; its publicists said this was &quot;largely because vocalist Burton C. Bell is tired of playing angry, aggressive music and wants to form a band that&#x27;s more indie-rock-oriented&quot;. In a final collaboration, the group recorded two songs for the video game &quot;The Terminator: Dawn of Fate&quot; that month. Fear Factory&#x27;s contractual obligations remained unfulfilled, however, and Roadrunner did not release them without controversially issuing the &quot;Concrete&quot; album in 2002 and the B-sides and rarities compilation, &quot;Hatefiles&quot;, in 2003. During his time away from Fear Factory, Bell with John Bechdel started a side project called Ascension of the Watchers, which released its first EP, &quot;Iconoclast&quot;, independently via their online store in 2005.

===First return and &quot;Archetype&quot; (2002–2004)===


Over time, tensions within the band developed between Dino Cazares and the other members, particularly Burton C. Bell and Raymond Herrera. When asked about the breakup in May 2002, Cazares made claims and allegations against Bell and the other members, stating that Fear Factory could continue without Christian Olde Wolbers and that he and Raymond Herrera were primarily motivated by money. Herrera responded to these allegations on behalf of the other band members, saying that Cazares was motivated by money and emphasizing Olde Wolbers&#x27; influence on the band&#x27;s sound. According to Herrera, the other band members would often come up with new ideas they wanted to incorporate into Fear Factory&#x27;s sound, but their suggestions were dismissed or openly ridiculed by Cazares, causing a rift between him and the other members that ultimately led to the band&#x27;s breakup. In the same interview, Herrera also revealed that Cazares had attempted to control the direction of the band by manipulating their business management and record company, and had openly lied to the other members about his actions.

Herrera and Olde Wolbers reunited later in 2002 and laid the foundations for the return of Fear Factory. Cazares was then permanently out of the band. Bell was approached with their demo recordings and was impressed enough to rejoin the band and Fear Factory was re-formed. Olde Wolbers switched to guitar and Byron Stroud of Strapping Young Lad was approached to join the band as a bassist. He was a member from 2003 until 2012. The bassist would also be in a side project with Bell called City OF Fire. Cazares continued recording and performing with his side project called Asesino, a Mexican deathgrind band. In 2007, he also started a new group called Divine Heresy.

Fear Factory made its live return as the mystery band at the Australian Big Day Out festival in January 2004, followed by its first American shows since re-forming on the spring Jägermeister tour with Slipknot and Chimaira. The new lineup&#x27;s first album &quot;Archetype&quot; was released on April 20, 2004, through new record label Liquid 8 Records based in Minnesota. With &quot;Archetype&quot;, Fear Factory returned to an alternative, industrial, metal sound; the album is generally considered to be a strong &#x27;return-to-form&#x27; record, if not a particularly innovative effort, with most of the trademark elements of the band firmly in place.

Videos were shot for the songs &quot;Cyberwaste&quot;, &quot;Archetype&quot;, and &quot;Bite the Hand That Bleeds&quot;; the latter featured on the &quot;Saw&quot; film soundtrack. The band performed on further tours with Lamb of God and Mastodon in the US and with Mnemic in Europe. The new Fear Factory has largely abandoned the direct &quot;Man versus Machine&quot; theme prevalent on earlier releases in favor of subjects such as religion, war, and corporatism.

===&quot;Transgression&quot; (2005–2006)===
Fear Factory announced plans to record and release its next full-length album over a very short period of time with mainstream rock producer Toby Wright, who had worked with Korn and Alice in Chains. This was allegedly due to pressure from Fear Factory&#x27;s new label Calvin Records, which preponed the album&#x27;s release date from four months away to just a month and a half so the band would have a new album to support on the inaugural Gigantour, which they had been invited to participate on by Dave Mustaine.

The resulting album, &quot;Transgression&quot;, was released on August 22, 2005, in the United Kingdom, and on the following day in North America, almost a year after &quot;Archetype&quot;. The album garnered highly polarized reviews; some critics hailed the album as diverse and progressive, and other reviewers did not receive the record very well. Although the album starts off as a Fear Factory record, subsequent songs include mellow/alt-rock numbers &quot;Echo of My Scream&quot; (featuring Faith No More&#x27;s Billy Gould on bass) and &quot;New Promise&quot;, a pop-rock song &quot;Supernova&quot;, and a faithful cover of U2&#x27;s rock song &quot;I Will Follow&quot;.

In 2013, Wolbers posted more details about writing and recording of Transgression and Archetype on his Facebook page. He said he was disappointed with &quot;Transgression&quot;, calling it half-finished, and blamed the label for the severe time constraints imposed during the recording sessions and for the inclusion of the U2 cover. However, Burton C. Bell said he is proud of the album and sees it as the band &quot;stepping over boundaries&quot;. In 2015 however, in an interview with Nuclear Blast Records, Bell called &quot;Transgression&quot;, a &quot;failed experiment&quot;.

Late in 2005, Fear Factory toured the U.S. again on the &quot;Machines at War&quot; tour, with an all-star death metal lineup of guests in Suffocation, Hypocrisy, and Decapitated; they played old classics from &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;, such as &quot;Crash Test&quot;, which they had not performed live in many years. During 2005 and 2006, Fear Factory promoted the album on the &quot;Fifteen Years of Fear&quot; world tour in celebration of their fifteenth anniversary. The members invited bands including Darkane, Strapping Young Lad and Soilwork to join them on the U.S. leg, and Misery Index to join them on the European leg.

===Hiatus and other projects (2006–2008)===
An online statement from Wolbers in December 2006 said the band would return to the studio to record a new album, produced by the band, immediately after the completion of the &quot;Transgression&quot; touring cycle. That month, Bell confirmed in an interview that the band would leave Liquid 8 Records.

Rather than begin work on a new studio album, the band members briefly parted and began working with other projects. Bell contributed vocals to the songs &quot;End of Days, Pt.1&quot;, &quot;End of Days, Pt. 2&quot;, and &quot;Die in a Crash&quot; on Ministry&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;The Last Sucker&quot;, and later toured with Ministry in support of the album. In an interview for the website Metalsucks, Bell called this a &quot;dream come true&quot;, describing Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen as &quot;one of [his] heroes&quot;. In the same interview, Bell talked at length about his new band Ascension of the Watchers, providing insight into the inspiration behind the project&#x27;s formation.

On March 21, 2008, while Fear Factory was on hiatus, Bell spoke in a video interview about the band&#x27;s future, saying he no longer wanted to contribute to the violence and aggression he saw in the world with the aggressive type of music Fear Factory produced. Wolbers and Herrera started a new band called Arkaea, with vocalist Jon Howard and bassist Pat Kavanagh of Threat Signal. Wolbers said, &quot;Ironically, half of the Arkaea album consists of songs that were intended to be the next Fear Factory record&quot;. Arkaea&#x27;s debut album &quot;Years in the Darkness&quot; was released on July 14, 2009.

===Second return, internal disputes, and &quot;Mechanize&quot; (2009–2011)===

On April 8, 2009, Bell and Cazares announced the reconciliation of their friendship, and the formation of a new project with Byron Stroud on bass and drummer Gene Hoglan of Testament, Death, Strapping Young Lad, Dark Angel, and Dethklok. On April 28, this project was announced to be a new version of Fear Factory without Herrera and Wolbers. When asked about their exclusion, Bell said, &quot;[Fear Factory is] like a business and I&#x27;m just reorganizing ... We won&#x27;t talk about [their exclusion]&quot;. Hoglan in retrospect has expressed some hesitation joining the band, saying that he only did it as a favour for Stroud.

In June 2009, Wolbers and Herrera spoke about the issue on the radio program &quot;Speed Freaks&quot;. Herrera said he and Wolbers were still in the band. &quot;[Christian and I] are actually still in Fear Factory ... [Burton and Dino] decided to start a new band, and furthermore, they decided to call it Fear Factory. They never communicated with us about it&quot;, said Herrera. Herrera also said the four original members—Bell, Cazares, Wolbers, and Herrera—were contractually regarded as Fear Factory Incorporated, and, &quot;it&#x27;s almost like them two against us two, so it&#x27;s kind of a stalemate&quot;. The drummer also said he and Wolbers had written eight songs for the next Fear Factory record, but that a &quot;personal disagreement&quot; had arisen between them and Bell, which left Bell not wanting to continue work with the band.

Bell and Cazares later spoke about their reasons for excluding Herrera and Wolbers. Cazares said Bell wanted to reunite the classic Fear Factory lineup of himself, Cazares, Herrera, and Wolbers, but that Herrera and Wolbers refused to be part of any reunion with Cazares. Bell also said he wanted to fire the band&#x27;s manager Christy Priske, who was also Wolbers&#x27; wife, and Herrera and Wolbers refused. Herrera and Wolbers threatened to sign a new record deal without Bell, prompting him to form a new version of Fear Factory without them. In some interviews, Wolbers said Bell had made &quot;growing unacceptable demands&quot;, which were declined. He said, &quot;Ray and I wanted what was best for the business and what he [Burton] was trying to change wasn&#x27;t really good for the business. It was only bad for the business, so that&#x27;s why he went into that whole phase of hijacking the name and trying to run with it.&quot;

Fear Factory featuring Bell and Cazares was due to make its live debut on June 21 at the Metalway Festival in Zaragoza, Spain. However, the show was canceled &quot;at the last minute&quot;, apparently because of the legal complications referenced by Herrera. The rest of that lineup&#x27;s planned performances in mid-2009, which included a tour of the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand that August, had also been canceled. The group said they canceled the tour to finish writing and recording the next Fear Factory album. Despite the canceled performances in Europe, they performed some shows in December in South American countries including Argentina, Chile, and Brazil.

During an interview on June 23, 2009, Cazares said he could never have a working relationship with Raymond and Wolbers again, saying they were too money-driven and criticized the music they recorded on &quot;Archetype&quot; for being too similar to the band&#x27;s earlier output. Despite ongoing issues between the two parties, the new Fear Factory went ahead with the recording process. In late July 2009, a short video shot with a cell telephone showed Cazares recording drum tracks with longtime contributor Rhys Fulber. On November 6, 2009, blabbermouth.net said a new album, &quot;Mechanize&quot;, would be released on February 9, 2010, on Candlelight Records. On November 8, 2009, Fear Factory released a track titled &quot;Powershifter&quot; on YouTube. On November 10, 2009, Bell announced the track list for &quot;Mechanize&quot;, along with an explanation of each song.

In January 2010, Fear Factory played in Australia and New Zealand tour on the Big Day Out tour, playing their first Australian dates since 2005 on January 17 at Parklands Showgrounds on Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast. Fear Factory released &quot;Mechanize&quot; on February 5, 2010, and began a U.S. tour titled &quot;Fear Campaign Tour 2010&quot;, in late March. In August 2010, the band headlined the Brutal Assault open air festival in Czech Republic. In September 2010, Fear Factory toured Australia, New Zealand, and Tokyo as the opening act for Metallica. The New Zealand concerts were in Christchurch, two shows that were brought about by a petition sent to Metallica asking them to visit New Zealand&#x27;s second-largest city. After the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, the South Island concerts were in doubt, but on September 15, 2010, an official announced the CBS Arena had escaped harm and both shows went ahead.

===&quot;The Industrialist&quot; (2011–2013)===

In an interview during the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise, Bell said Fear Factory was planning to write and record a &quot;full-on concept&quot; album, which was due for release in 2012. He said, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna kind of take a break a little bit, but we&#x27;re definitely going into the studio at some point and start writing. We wanna take our time doing it. Personally ... &quot;Mechanize&quot;, don&#x27;t get me wrong, is a good record—I&#x27;m very proud of it—but it&#x27;s gotta be better than that. I&#x27;ve got plans where I&#x27;d like to do a full-on concept again—story, artwork. Just make it real cerebral. But there&#x27;ll definitely be another Fear Factory record, maybe in 2012.&quot; On August 3, 2011, Dino Cazares said on his Twitter feed that he was working and demoing new material for the next Fear Factory album. On January 25, 2012, the band announced the new album will be titled &quot;The Industrialist&quot;. The album was again co-produced by the band with Rhys Fulber and mixed by Greg Reely.

Byron Stroud left the band early in 2012, saying, &quot;Life&#x27;s too short to spend it with people who don&#x27;t respect you&quot;. In one interview, Cazares said he did not know why Stroud decided to leave and that he could not play the bass parts on &quot;Mechanize&quot;, prompting Cazares to do it himself.

In February 2012, former Chimaira guitar player Matt DeVries replaced Stroud. On April 19, 2012, Mike Heller of Malignancy and System Divide was announced as the band&#x27;s new drummer, replacing Gene Hoglan; in a 2013 interview, Hoglan claimed that he only found out through Blabbermouth.net that he was no longer needed, and expressed some disappointment about the course of events. At the same time, Cazares confirmed on his Facebook page that John Sankey of Devolved had programmed the drums on &quot;The Industrialist&quot;. Burton described &quot;The Industrialist&quot; as another concept album &quot;sonically, conceptually, and lyrically&quot;. Cazares also said he and Burton were the two in control of the record&#x27;s outcome, and that the songwriting on the album was much more &quot;definitive&quot; in regards to Fear Factory&#x27;s platform sound. On June 4, 2012,&quot;The Industrialist&quot; was available to stream through AOL Music. The album was released through Candlelight Records on June 5, 2012.

On May 2, 2013, Cazares commented regarding the status of Fear Factory albums &quot;Archetype&quot; and &quot;Transgression&quot;, which were recorded without his participation, and the band&#x27;s decision not to play songs from them live, saying &quot;they don&#x27;t count&quot; as Fear Factory albums. Contradicting this, Fear Factory played the track &quot;Archetype&quot; on its 2013 Australian tour in early July, with minor changes to the song&#x27;s lyrics; as of 2023, the band continues to play songs from the album, with Cazares saying &quot;The fans want it, and I got used to playing it, so it&#x27;s all good.&quot;

===&quot;Genexus&quot; (2013–2015)===

On May 1, 2013, Dino Cazares told Songfacts.com Fear Factory would begin work on their ninth studio album after the end of &quot;The Industrialist&quot; tour. The album was expected to be released in early 2014. On May 13, 2013, Burton C. Bell told Metal-Rules.com, &quot;Fear Factory will continue to tour North America and Europe 2013. We&#x27;ve got some more tours scheduled, some summer festivals next year. During that time our plan is to start writing a new record and we would like to have a new record out by spring 2014&quot;. On March 19, 2014, Bell told Brave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles he would like to have the new album released by August, followed by a tour in September. On September 12, 2014, the band announced it had signed to record label Nuclear Blast and would enter the studio in October. The band also confirmed that the album would be mixed by Andy Sneap, and that Rhys Fulber would again produce it.

The band played their first shows in India, in November 2014, as part of the Weekender Tour, and on February/March 2015, they participated at the Soundwave Festival in Australia and New Zealand.

On May 1, 2015, it was announced that former Static-X and Soulfly bassist Tony Campos joined the band. Later that month, Fear Factory announced that they would release their ninth studio album, titled &quot;Genexus&quot;, on August 7, 2015.

They toured in European festivals in July 2015, and then onto North America, as an opening act for Coal Chamber. From late August until mid-September 2015, the band toured the midwestern, southern and southwestern United States with support from Once Human (starring Logan Mader), Los Angeles melodic metal band Before the Mourning and Chicago rock band The Bloodline. They also announced that they would play the entire &quot;Demanufacture&quot; album in Europe between November and December 2015, a tour which again included Once Human with the addition of Irish band Dead Label as openers.

===Hiatus and lawsuits (2016–2019)===
In a November 2016 interview with &quot;Loudwire&quot;, guitarist Dino Cazares revealed that Fear Factory had planned to release their tenth studio album in mid-to-late 2017. He stated, &quot;Right now we&#x27;re going to be home and doing a new record. We&#x27;re writing already and in the process of doing a new record, but it probably won&#x27;t be out until late summer of next year or maybe even October. I&#x27;m not exactly sure.&quot;

In a December 2016 interview with The Ex-Man, despite an ongoing &quot;huge legal battle&quot; with Bell and Cazares, former bassist-guitarist Christian Olde Wolbers stated that he was &quot;trying to reach out and try to get this reunion thing happening.&quot; He added, &quot;There would be nothing better for this band [than] to reconcile our differences, fucking write a killer record, which I know we can, and fucking we would be doing really big tours. My passion for playing and what we have invested in this band is very big, and I know it&#x27;s really big for Dino as well, &#x27;cause he started it with Raymond back in the day.&quot; More fuel to the possibility of a reunion with the &quot;classic&quot; lineup of Bell, Cazares, Herrera and Olde Wolbers was added later that month, when Olde Wolbers posted an image on his Instagram account, suggesting Fear Factory&#x27;s official website was &quot;under construction.&quot;

On May 7, 2017, Wolbers posted a blank picture on his Instagram (which was later deleted), claiming that Fear Factory had broken up. Later that day, Cazares was asked via Twitter if they were still together, and his response was, &quot;Not sure why your asking that and rant by who?&quot;.

In an interview with Kilpop in May 2017, Burton C. Bell said that the new songs were &quot;even stronger than &quot;Genexus&quot;, &#x27;cause it just seems even more tight. We&#x27;re on a groove, and it&#x27;s kicking ass.&quot;

In an interview with SiriusXM&#x27;s Jose Mangin at November 2018&#x27;s inaugural Headbangers Con in Portland, Oregon, Bell revealed &quot;Monolith&quot; as the title of Fear Factory&#x27;s tenth studio album and its tentative artwork via his smartphone. In October 2019, this was refuted by guitarist Dino Cazares who stated via his Twitter account that there was no new Fear Factory album. Shortly thereafter, Cazares expressed uncertainty towards the band&#x27;s future, indicating that a lawsuit filed by former members Raymond Herrera and Christian Olde Wolbers had prevented him and Bell from using the Fear Factory name.

===Split with Burton C. Bell and &quot;Aggression Continuum&quot; (2020–2022)===

On September 2, 2020, Dino Cazares announced he would be releasing new Fear Factory music in 2021. Less than a month later, Burton C. Bell announced he quit Fear Factory citing &quot;consistent series of dishonest representations and unfounded accusations from past and present band members&quot;, leaving no original members left in the band besides Cazares. However, Bell&#x27;s contributions to their upcoming album remained, as he recorded his vocals in 2017. He claimed his relationship with Cazares began to fray when they got into a physical altercation during the recording of &quot;Genexus&quot;, &quot;because [Cazares] said something he shouldn&#x27;t have&quot;.

In an interview with Robb Flynn on September 28, 2020, which took place within hours after Bell announced his departure from Fear Factory, Cazares claimed that he was not aware of the split until he &quot;found out [about it] via social media.&quot; He also claimed that one of the reasons behind Bell&#x27;s departure was not only due to the lawsuit that prevented the release of the band&#x27;s new album, but because the latter&#x27;s portion of the Fear Factory &quot;trademark ownership became available&quot;, which left Cazares as the sole owner of the band name. Cazares reiterated that Bell&#x27;s vocals would appear on the new album, which was being mixed by Andy Sneap for a March 2021 release, and hoped the pair would continue to work together in order to support it.

On April 1, 2021, Fear Factory announced that their first new song in over five years would be released on April 16. A short riff teaser of the song from Cazares was released soon after. The new single &quot;Disruptor&quot; was released on April 16, followed by the announcement of the tenth studio album &quot;Aggression Continuum&quot;, which was released on June 18.

===Arrival of Milo Silvestro and next album (2023–present)===
While deciding on a new vocalist through auditions, Cazares said that gender would not play a role, expressing an open interest in hiring a woman; however, he said that he would not announce it for a while. Out of all the potential talents, he decided on a replacement who had yet to be revealed, with the member being a male and &quot;kind of known&quot; within the metal scene. He also said that the new member would be introduced through new songs. Wolbers expressed support for Cazares carrying on with the band. On February 21, 2023, the band finally unveiled that after auditioning over 300 people, Italian singer Milo Silvestro was their new vocalist. During the cancelation of the first date of the 2023 North American tour, it was revealed on an Instagram story post that Pete Webber of Havok would be filling in as drummer for the band.

In May 2023, Webber was confirmed as the new settled percussionist for the ensemble.

In June 2023, a revised version of Fear Factory&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;The Industrialist&quot; was released with the new title &quot;Re-Industrialized.&quot; This version featured re-recorded drum tracks performed by the band&#x27;s previous drummer, Mike Heller, as well as remixes of two songs from the album: &quot;Recharger&quot; and &quot;Difference Engine&quot;. Cazares also re-recorded all his guitar tracks with a different tone and some alterations to certain musical sections in each track. Three cover songs were also added to this new edition: &quot;Landfill,&quot; &quot;Saturation,&quot; and &quot;Passing Complexion.&quot;

In July 2024, Cazares confirmed that a new Fear Factory album will be released in 2025.

In November 2024, Dino Cazares in an interview explained in further detail why a reunion of himself and Burton C. Bell, Christian Olde Wolbers, and Raymond Herrera, will not be possible in the foreseeable future and how he came to own one hundred percent of the Fear Factory name intellectual property copyrights trademarks.

==Musical style, influences, and legacy==
Fear Factory has been classified under several metal genres, most often as industrial metal and groove metal, but also as nu metal, cyber metal, alternative metal, thrash metal, and death metal. The band began as a death metal band with their debut album &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;, but quickly moved to industrial metal after that album. Fear Factory&#x27;s influences include Slayer, Exodus, Napalm Death, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, and Godflesh.

In terms of influences on the group&#x27;s work, Dino Cazares has cited the band members&#x27; interests in fantasy and science fiction alternative universes such as the &quot;Terminator&quot; mythos as well as the &quot;Dune&quot; mythos. As a specific example, their debut album, &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;, picked up its name directly from a line in a movie critic review of the &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; film (discussing the T-1000 villain). Cazares has also cited recurring influences on Fear Factory coming from conventional popular music, outside of the genres of hard rock and heavy metal, for instance looking to singer-songwriter Paul McCartney&#x27;s sounds in both The Beatles and Wings. Over the years the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; has become a recurring theme as the band often makes lyrical reference to the plot, as well as directly quote and sample lines from the film.

Fear Factory&#x27;s innovative approach towards and hybridization of the genres industrial metal, death metal, and alternative metal has had a lasting impact on other artists coming later, the band putting a stamp on metal music ever since the release of their first album in 1992. Fear Factory is noteworthy among contemporaries for its lyrical focus on science fiction, with much of the band&#x27;s music telling a single story spanning several concept albums. The band has been called a &quot;stepping stone&quot;, leading mainstream listeners to venture into less-known, more extreme bands, and are consistently appreciated. Despite the heavy use of ambient and sampling sounds, the band has never had an official keyboardist in their lineup; they instead employ session/touring members.

In the liner notes of the re-released version of &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;, Machine Head vocalist Robb Flynn, Chimaira vocalist Mark Hunter, and Spineshank guitarist Mike Sarkisyan cited Fear Factory as an influence. Robb Flynn said his vocal style was influenced by Burton C. Bell&#x27;s vocals and Machine Head have been wrongly credited for the vocal style. Mark Hunter said Chimaira&#x27;s drumming was heavily influenced by Raymond Herrera. Slipknot, Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying, Static-X, and Coal Chamber have also mentioned Fear Factory in their liner notes.

Modern bands including Mnemic, Scarve, Stiff Valentine, and Threat Signal contain significant influences from Fear Factory&#x27;s technique and have also credited a substantial debt of gratitude to the band. Peter Tägtgren of Hypocrisy said, &quot;Fear Factory are close to our hearts&quot; and, &quot;&quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; was the influence for me to start my other project, &#x27;Pain&#x27;&quot;. Devin Townsend of Strapping Young Lad said his main influences for &quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot; were Fear Factory and Napalm Death. In an interview on &quot;That Metal Show&quot;, Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward said Fear Factory is one of the bands he wishes he could play with, and picked &quot;Mechanize&quot; as one of his favourite albums.

<text>Charles Mason (25 April 172825 October 1786) was a British-American astronomer who made significant contributions to 18th-century science and American history, particularly through his survey with Jeremiah Dixon of the Mason–Dixon line, which came to mark the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania (1764–1768). The border between Delaware and Maryland is also defined by a part of the Mason–Dixon line.

==Early career==
Mason&#x27;s early career was spent at the Royal Greenwich Observatory near London. He served as assistant astronomer from 1756 to 1760 under the Reverend James Bradley, the third Astronomer Royal.

While employed at the Greenwich Observatory, Mason became familiar with Professor Tobias Mayer&#x27;s &quot;Tables of the Moon&quot;. The &quot;Lunar Tables&quot; were designed to solve the problem of determining longitude at sea, a challenge that frustrated scientists and navigators for decades. Mason worked throughout his life to perfect the &quot;Lunar Tables&quot; as a method of improving navigation at sea. In 1787, Mason&#x27;s work was recognised, and he was awarded £750 (not the full prize of £10,000 to £20,000) by the Board of Longitude for his work on perfecting the &quot;Tables&quot;.

==1761 transit of Venus==
In 1761, Mason was assigned to travel to the island of Sumatra to observe the transit of Venus as part of an international effort to record data that would enable scientists to determine the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Mason was joined by Jeremiah Dixon, a surveyor and amateur astronomer from Cockfield in the County of Durham. Owing to an attack by a French man-of-war, they did not reach their destination in time for the transit and were forced to record their observations from the Cape of Good Hope. On the way back from the Cape they visited St Helena where they made a series of observations with the astronomer Nevil Maskelyne.

==The Mason–Dixon line survey==

From November 1763 to 1768, Mason and Jeremiah Dixon established the boundary line between the American provinces of Pennsylvania and Maryland. Colonial surveyors had been unable to establish the boundary accurately due to their poor training and inadequate scientific instruments. Mason and Dixon, accompanied by a large party of assistants, established three important boundaries: (1) the south boundary line of Pennsylvania separating it from Maryland and Virginia; (2) the west boundary of the three lower counties of Pennsylvania (now Delaware) separating it from Maryland; and (3) the south boundary of the three lower counties. The pair also conducted a number of experiments for the Royal Society such as measuring a degree of latitude. Mason&#x27;s journal provides the most complete record of the survey and its progress. The journal includes his astronomical observations and personal notes about the American frontier environment and his experiences in colonial America.

Mason and Dixon failed to measure the entire length of the south boundary of Pennsylvania as determined by its charter. In the summer of 1767, the surveying party crossed the Monongahela River and the Great Catawba War Path, violating a treaty limiting the westward expansion of English settlements. Not wishing to risk inciting native hostilities, Mason and Dixon were forced to return east after making their final observations at the crest of Brown&#x27;s Hill.

==Career after the Mason–Dixon line survey==
After completing the boundary survey in the United States, Mason returned to Greenwich where he continued work on Mayer&#x27;s &quot;Lunar Tables&quot;. He also contributed to the &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot;, working under Nevil Maskelyne, the fifth Astronomer Royal.

On 27 September 1786, Mason wrote to Benjamin Franklin, whom he knew from his election to the American Philosophical Society in 1767 where Franklin was a founding member, informing him that he had returned to Philadelphia with his wife, seven sons, and one daughter. Mason was very ill and confined to his bed. Mason also shared with Franklin the design for an astronomical project. Mason provided no explanation for his return to the United States, and nothing more is known of Mason&#x27;s proposed project.

Mason died on 25 October 1786, in Philadelphia. He was buried there in Christ Church Burial Ground.

==Posthumous recognition==
The crater Mason on the Moon is named after him.

Mason is one of the title characters of Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;. The song &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot;, inspired by Pynchon&#x27;s book, appears on Mark Knopfler&#x27;s album of the same name; on the original version, Knopfler sings the role of Dixon and James Taylor that of Mason.

Surveying organizations dedicated a memorial at his previously unmarked grave on 31 August 2013, using a Mason–Dixon line stone that was found displaced from its position.

<text>An arsenal is a place where arms and ammunition are made, maintained and repaired, stored, or issued, in any combination, whether privately or publicly owned. Arsenal and armoury (British English) or armory (American English) are mostly regarded as synonyms, although subtle differences in usage exist.

A sub-armory is a place of temporary storage or carrying of weapons and ammunition, such as any temporary post or patrol vehicle that is only operational in certain times of the day.

==Etymology==
The term in English entered the language in the 16th century as a loanword from , itself deriving from the term , which in turn is thought to be a corruption of , , meaning &quot;manufacturing shop&quot;.

==Types==
A lower-class arsenal, which can furnish the materiel and equipment of a small army, may contain a laboratory, gun and carriage factories, small-arms ammunition, small-arms, harness, saddlery tent and powder factories; in addition, it must possess great storehouses. In a second-class arsenal, the factories would be replaced by workshops. The situation of an arsenal should be governed by strategic considerations. If of the first class, it should be situated at the base of operations and supply, secure from attack, not too near a frontier, and placed so as to draw in readily the resources of the country. The importance of a large arsenal is such that its defences would be on the scale of those of a large fortress.

In the early 21st century, the term &quot;floating armoury&quot; described a ship storing weapons to be supplied to merchant vessels in international waters subject to piracy, so that the weapons do not enter territorial waters where they would be illegal.

==Operational subdivision==

The branches in a great arsenal are usually subdivided into &quot;storekeeping&quot;, &quot;construction&quot; and &quot;administration&quot;:

* Under &quot;storekeeping&quot; the arsenal should have the following departments and stores: Departments of issue and receipt, pattern room, armoury department, ordnance or park, harness, saddlery and accoutrements, camp equipment, tools and instruments, engineer store, timber yard, breaking-up store, and unserviceable store.
* Under &quot;construction&quot;: Gun factory, carriage factory, laboratory, small arms factory, harness and tent factory, gunpowder factory, etc. In a second-class arsenal there would be workshops instead of factories.
* Under the head of &quot;administration&quot; would be classed the chief director of the arsenal, officials military and civil, non-commissioned officers and military artificers, civilian foremen, workmen and laborers, with the clerks and writers necessary for the office work of the establishments.

In the manufacturing branches are required skill, and efficient and economical work, both executive and administrative; in the storekeeping part, good arrangement, great care, thorough knowledge of all warlike stores, both in their active and passive state, and scrupulous exactness in the custody, issue and receipt of stores. Frederick Taylor introduced command and control techniques to arsenals, including the U.S.&#x27;s Watertown Arsenal (a principal center for artillery design and manufacture) and Frankford Arsenal (a principal center for small arms ammunition design and manufacture).

<text>Jeremiah Dixon (27 July 1733 – 22 January 1779), British surveyor and astronomer, created the Mason–Dixon line with Charles Mason, from 1763 to 1767, which became significant during the American Civil War.

==Early life and education==
Dixon was born in Cockfield, near Bishop Auckland, County Durham, in 1733, to an established Yorkshire family. Dixon became interested in astronomy and mathematics during his education at John Kipling&#x27;s Academy in Barnard Castle. Early in life he became acquaintanced with the eminent intellectuals of Southern Durham: mathematician William Emerson, and astronomers John Bird and Thomas Wright.

==Mason-Dixon Line==
Dixon was recommended to assist Charles Mason in 1761, likely by astronomer John Bird, an active Fellow of the Royal Society. The Royal Society sent them to observe the transit of Venus from Sumatra. However, their passage to Sumatra was delayed, and they landed instead at the Cape of Good Hope where the transit was observed on 6 June 1761. Dixon returned to the Cape once again with Nevil Maskelyne&#x27;s clock to work on experiments with gravity.

Dixon and Mason signed an agreement in 1763 with the proprietors of Pennsylvania and Maryland, Thomas Penn and Frederick Calvert, sixth Baron Baltimore, to assist with resolving a boundary dispute between the two provinces. They arrived in Philadelphia in November 1763 and began work towards the end of the year. The survey was not complete until late 1766, following which they stayed on to measure a degree of Earth&#x27;s meridian on the Delmarva Peninsula in Maryland, on behalf of the Royal Society. The boundary between the states is 312 miles long, but Mason and Dixon only surveyed 240 miles, before they were driven away by hostile Indians in November 1767. The Mason-Dixon Line later became the focal point for the American Civil War (1861-1865).

An anecdote recounts Jeremiah Dixon&#x27;s views:

&quot;&quot;Jeremiah Dixon, happening upon a slave driver mercilessly beating a poor black woman. &#x27;Thou must not do that!&#x27; he shouted. &#x27;You be damned! Mind your own business,&#x27; came the reply. &#x27;If thou doesn&#x27;t desist, I&#x27;ll thrash thee!&quot;&#x27;

&quot;Tall and powerful, Jeremiah seized the slave-driver&#x27;s whip and gave him a soun thrashing. When he returned to Cockfield, the whip came too, and was one of the Quaker family&#x27;s treasured possessions.&quot; &quot;

Dixon and Mason also made a number of gravity measurements with the same instrument that Dixon had used with Maskelyne in 1761. Before returning to England in 1768, they were both admitted to the American Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge, in Philadelphia.

==Other work==
Dixon sailed to Norway in 1769 with William Bayly to observe another transit of Venus. The two split up, with Dixon at Hammerfest Island and Bayly at North Cape, in order to minimize the possibility of inclement weather obstructing their measurements. Following their return to England in July, Dixon resumed his work as a surveyor in Durham, surveying the park of Auckland Castle and Lanchester Common.

==Dixon family of Cockfield== 

The Dixon family originated from the Dixons at Furness Fells, descending from Thomas Dixon, 1st Baron of Symondstone in the 13th century. Sir Nicholas Dixon (1390-1448) was born at High House, Furness Falls. His grandson, Sir John Dixon (1460-1550), was a government official under Henry VIII. 

His grandson, George Dixon (1550-1631), esq. of Ramshaw Hall, was collector of the Barony of Evenwood. He was granted arms in 1614, at the visitation of Richard St George.

George Dixon (1635-1707) was a &quot;Quaker by convincement&quot;, joining the Society of Friends &quot;at its rise&quot;, an early follower of George Fox.

George Dixon (1671-1752), was seneschal to Gilbert Vane, Second Baron Barnard at Raby Castle. He often refused to bring Lord Barnard more wine, if he drank excessively. Bemused by this curiosity, Baron Barnard&#x27;s guests bet £200 that George would not refuse his master; when he did, they commissioned Sir Joshua Reynolds to paint a portrait of George &quot;An Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile&quot; and a quote from Horace &quot;Fortis &amp; in seeps totes trees ate rotunds&quot; (&quot;&quot;strong to restrain immoderate desires, lightly esteeming public honours, a self-reliant and courteous man&quot;). This was Jeremiah Dixon&#x27;s great-uncle.

Sir George Fenwick Dixon (1701-1755), a coal mining magnate in Bishop Auckland and Cockfield married Mary Hunter, a native of Newcastle, &quot;the cleverest woman&quot;&quot; ever to marry into the Dixon family. 

They had seven children, including Jeremiah Dixon and George Dixon (Cockfield Canal) was an engineer and inventor.

Jeremiah’s great-nephew John Dixon (engineer) worked on the Darlington Rocket with George Stephenson, in 1820. John Dixon’s three nephews were also active: Sir Raylton Dixon, shipbuilding magnate and Mayor of Middlesbrough; the engineer John Dixon, who transported Cleopatra’s Needle to London in 1877; and his brother Waynman Dixon was an engineer and Egyptologist at Giza, and later Honorary Consul to Japan in 1922.

==Death and Legacy==

Dixon died unmarried in Cockfield on 22 January 1779, at the age of 46, and was buried in an unmarked grave in the Quaker cemetery in Staindrop. Although he was recognised as a Quaker, he was known to violate rules by wearing a long red coat (possibly from the Royal Woolwich Academy) and occasionally drinking to excess. His nephew, John Dixon, came into possession of his &quot;common theodolite&quot;, a work of George Adams. John&#x27;s grandson, Edward, donated it to the Royal Geographical Society circa 1916.

Dixon&#x27;s name may be the origin for the nickname &quot;Dixie&quot; used in reference to the Southern United States.

Jeremiah Dixon is one of the two title characters of Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;. The song &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot; from Mark Knopfler&#x27;s album of the same name, also refers to Mason and Dixon, and was inspired by Pynchon&#x27;s book.
An exhibition about the life and work of Jeremiah Dixon was mounted at the Bowes Museum in Barnard Castle in England in 2013. Titled &quot;Jeremiah Dixon: Scientist, Surveyor and Stargazer&quot;, it was scheduled to run from 27 April to 6 October.

In September 2013, a locomotive operating on the Weardale Railway in County Durham was named after Jeremiah Dixon. The locomotive now operates in the Willesden area of northwest London.

<text>A local community has been defined as a group of interacting people living in a common location. The word is often used to refer to a group that is organized around common values and is attributed with social cohesion within a shared geographical location, generally in social units larger than a household. The word can also refer to the national community or global community.

The word &quot;community&quot; is derived from the Old French &quot;communité&quot; which is derived from the Latin &quot;communitas&quot; (&quot;cum&quot;, &quot;with/together&quot; and &quot;munus&quot;, &quot;gift&quot;), a broad term for fellowship or organized society.

A sense of community refers to people&#x27;s perception of interconnection and interdependence, shared responsibility, and goals.

Understanding a community entails having knowledge of community needs and resources, having respect for community members, and involving key community members in programs.

==Benefits of local community==
The author Robert Putnam refers to the value which comes from social networks as social capital in his book &quot;Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community.&quot; He writes that social capital &quot;makes an enormous difference in our lives&quot;, that &quot;a society characterized by generalized reciprocity is more efficient that a distrustful society&quot; and that economic sociologists have shown a minimized economic wealth if social capital is lacking.

Putnam reports that the first use of the social capital theory was by L. J. Hanifan, a practical reformer during the Progressive Era in the United States of America. The following description of social capital is a quote from L.J. Hanifan in Putnam&#x27;s Book:

;Employment
Putnam reported that many studies have shown that the highest predictor of job satisfaction is the presence of social connection in the . He writes that &quot;people with friends at work are happier at work.&quot; And that &quot;social networks provide people with advice, a bonus, a promotion, and other strategic information, and letters of recommendation.&quot;

Community engagement has been proven to counteract the most negative attributes of poverty and a high amount of social capital has been shown to reduce crime.

;Local community and health
&quot;Social connectedness matters to our lives in the most profound way.&quot; -Robert Putnam.

Robert Putnam reports, in the chapter &quot;Health and Happiness&quot; from his book &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;, that recent public research shows social connection impacts all areas of human health, this includes psychological and physical aspects of human health. Putnam says &quot;...beyond a doubt that social connectedness is one of the most powerful determinates of our well being.&quot; In particular it is face to face connections which have been shown to have greater impacts then non-face to face relationships.

Specific health benefits of strong social relationships are a decrease in the likelihood of: seasonal viruses, heart attacks, strokes, cancer, depression, and premature death of all sorts.

; Online initiatives
There are online initiatives to improve local communities like LOCAL (www.localchange.com).

== Community sustainability==
Sustainability in community programs is the capacity of programs (services designed to meet the needs of community members) to continuously respond to community issues.

A sustained program maintains a focus consonant with its original goals and objectives, including the individuals, families, and communities it was originally intended to serve. Programs change regarding the breadth and depth of their programming. Some become aligned with other organizations and established institutions, whereas others maintain their independence.
Understanding the community context in which programs serving the community function has an important influence on program sustainability and success.

==Local economy==

According to Washington state&#x27;s Sustain South Sound organization, the top ten reasons to buy locally are:

# To strengthen local economy: Studies have shown that buying from an independent, locally owned business, significantly raises the number of times your money is used to make purchases from other local businesses, service providers and farms—continuing to strengthen the economic base of the community.
# Increase jobs: Small local businesses are the largest employer nationally in the United States of America.
# Encourage local prosperity: A growing body of economic research shows that in an increasingly homogenized world, entrepreneurs and skilled workers are more likely to invest and settle in communities that preserve their one-of-a-kind businesses and distinctive character.
# Reduce environmental impact: Locally owned businesses can make more local purchases requiring less transportation and generally set up shop in town or city centers as opposed to developing on the fringe. This means contributing less to greenhouse gas emissions, sprawl, congestion, habitat loss and pollution.
# Support community groups: Non-profit organizations receive an average 250% more support from smaller business owners than they do from large businesses.
# Keep your community unique: Where we shop, where we eat and have fun—all of it makes our community home.
# Get better service: Local businesses often hire people with a better understanding of the products they are selling and take more time to get to know customers.
# Invest in community: Local businesses are owned by people who live in the community, are less likely to leave, and are more invested in the community&#x27;s future.
# Put your taxes to good use: Local businesses in town centers require comparatively little infrastructure investment and make more efficient use of public services as compared to nationally owned stores entering the community.
# Buy what you want, not what someone wants you to buy: A marketplace of tens of thousands of small businesses is the best way to ensure innovation and low prices over the long-term. A multitude of small businesses, each selecting products based not on a national sales plan but on their own interests and the needs of their local customers, guarantees a much broader range of product choices.

<doc id="191134" wikidata="Q1542194" url="?curid=191134" title="The Turner Diaries">
<text>The Turner Diaries is a 1978 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of National Alliance, a white nationalist group, published under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. It was initially syndicated in the National Alliance publication &quot;Attack!&quot; from 1975–1978 before being published in paperback form by the National Alliance&#x27;s publishing arm National Vanguard Books in 1978. the book had sold an estimated 300,000 copies, initially only available through mail order from the National Alliance. In 1996, it was republished by Barricade Books with a foreword that disavowed the novel. &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; was described as being &quot;explicitly racist and anti-Semitic&quot; by &quot;The New York Times.&quot; 

It depicts a violent revolution in the United States, caused by a group called the Organization. The Organization&#x27;s actions lead to the overthrow of the federal government, a nuclear war, and ultimately a race war which leads to the systematic extermination of non-whites and Jews worldwide. Whites viewed as &quot;race traitors&quot; are ultimately hanged in a mass execution called the &quot;Day of the Rope&quot;. The novel utilizes a framing device, presenting the story as a historical diary of an average member, Earl Turner, with historical notes from a century after the novel&#x27;s events.

The book has been influential in shaping white nationalism and the later development of the white genocide conspiracy theory. It has also inspired numerous hate crimes and acts of terrorism, including the 1984 assassination of Alan Berg, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and the 1999 London nail bombings. It is estimated to have influenced perpetrators in over 200 killings. The phrase the &quot;Day of the Rope&quot; has also become popular in far-right and white nationalist circles.

== Plot ==
A framing device which takes place in 2099 (100 years after the events depicted) gives the novel&#x27;s main text a historical context, which is presented as the journal of Earl Turner, an active but not high-ranking member of a white nationalist movement known as the Organization. After the federal government has confiscated all white civilian firearms in the country under the Cohen Act, the Organization goes underground to wage a guerrilla war against what they term the &quot;System&quot;, a loose network of America&#x27;s most powerful institutions of government, media, society, and finance, which are depicted as all being led by Jews. In response to the Organization&#x27;s actions, the System begins by implementing numerous repressive laws, by pushing for new surveillance measures, such as requiring citizens to possess a special passport at all times to permanently monitor where individuals are.

Turner plays a large part in activities in the Washington, D.C. area; a former electrical engineer, he is skilled with technology and plays a large part in the Organization&#x27;s communications and in setting up weaponry for their terrorist attacks. He plays an important part in the first large scale attack by the Organization, in which they attack an FBI headquarters using a car bomb. Turner&#x27;s service leads to his initiation into the Order: a secret higher level organization within the Organization, which secretly leads it. Its existence remains unknown both to ordinary Organization members and the System; inductees are given a poisonous capsule to kill themselves with in the event of capture. Later, Turner&#x27;s hideout is raided by law enforcement after he fails to maintain security practices. During an ensuing gun battle with authorities, everyone in the unit manages to escape but Turner is captured and nearly killed. He is arrested and sent to a military base for interrogation by the FBI and an Israeli intelligence officer. He is tortured in an effort to coerce the release of information on the Organization. 

Months later, other members of the Order rescue him, and inform him of his punishment for breaking his oath to the Order by failing to kill himself when captured: at some point in the future he will be given a suicide mission. If he completes the mission successfully, he will be forgiven by the Order; Turner accepts this. Eventually, the Organization seizes the nuclear weapons at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern California and targets missiles at New York City and Tel Aviv. While in control of California, the Organization ethnically cleanses the area of all non-whites by forcing them into the Eastern United States, which is still controlled by the System. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of African Americans are forced into the desert to cause an economic crisis on the System&#x27;s welfare system and all Jews are beaten, lynched, or shot. The resulting racial conflict in the east causes many whites to &quot;wake up&quot; and begin fleeing to Southern California, which becomes a white ethnostate. Northern California also falls, but is ruled under martial law by a conservative general who refuses to cooperate with the Organization. 

The Organization raids the houses of all individuals who have been reported to be race traitors in some way (such as lawyers, politicians, clergy, journalists, entertainers, etc.), and white people who &quot;defiled&quot; their race by living with or marrying non-whites. These individuals are dragged from their homes and publicly hanged in the streets in Los Angeles in an event which comes to be known as the &quot;Day of the Rope&quot; (August 1, 1993). Most of these public executions are filmed for propaganda purposes. The Organization then uses both its southern Californian base of operations and its nuclear weapons to open a wider war in which it launches nuclear strikes against New York City and Israel, initiates a nuclear exchange between the United States and Soviet Union, and plants nuclear weapons and new combat units throughout North America. Many major U.S. cities are destroyed, including Baltimore and Detroit. Governments all over the world fall one by one, and violent anti-Jewish riots break out in the streets. After the nuclear weapons are launched against Israel and Tel Aviv is destroyed, the Arabs take advantage of the opportunity and proceed to swarm into Israel and kill all Israelis. Meanwhile, the United States is put in a state of absolute martial law and transformed into a military dictatorship. The United States government decides to launch an invasion of the Organization&#x27;s stronghold in southern California. 

The leaders of the Order now inform Earl Turner of his punishment for having failed to resist his interrogators during his captivity: he must pilot a crop duster equipped with a nuclear warhead and destroy the Pentagon in a kamikaze style suicide strike, before the invasion can be ordered. The epilogue summarizes how, following the success of Turner&#x27;s mission, the Organization went on to conquer the rest of the world and how all non-white races of people were murdered. The epilogue concludes with the statement that &quot;just 110 years after the birth of the Great One, the dream of a white world finally became a certainty... and the Order would spread its wise and benevolent rule over the earth for all time to come.&quot;

== Background ==

&quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; was written by William Luther Pierce. Pierce was both founder and leader of the National Alliance organization, which the Anti-Defamation League called in 2000 &quot;the single most dangerous organized hate group in the United States today&quot; (largely as a result of Pierce&#x27;s authorship of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;). Pierce himself was said by the Southern Poverty Law Center to have been &quot;America’s most important neo-Nazi&quot; as well as &quot;the movement’s fiercest antisemitic ideologue&quot;. Pierce was a physicist who received his doctorate from the University of Colorado, and a former professor at Oregon State University.

The main story was originally set in the 1980s; Pierce changed it to the 1990s when the series was compiled to be published as a book in 1978. Pierce stated in a 1997 interview that at the time he had written the book he had wanted to put &quot;all of the feminist agitators and propagandists and all of the race-mixing fanatics and all of the media bosses [...] up against a wall, in batches of a thousand or so at a time, and machine-gun them&quot;. He also added that he still wanted to do that. Pierce however denied that he had written the book intending for it to function as a model for the depicted violent race war.

=== Influences ===

The novel, being a work of dystopian fiction, is concerned with the collapse of society; this genre emerged prominently in the early 19th century, and early dystopian novels often had racist themes. Terrorism researcher J.M. Berger tied the novel to several other racial dystopia novels, saying they had influenced &quot;Turner&quot;&#x27;s development directly or indirectly (i.e. having been directly read by Pierce, or having inspired works that he read). Among the possible influences, Berger listed the antebellum novels &quot;A Sojourn in the City of Amalgamation&quot;, &quot;The Partisan Leader, Wild Southern Scenes&quot;, and &quot;Anticipations of the Future&quot;, which all used dystopian elements to criticize anti-slavery activism or North-South tensions.&#x27; He particularly noted &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; as having &quot;striking similarities&quot; with &quot;Anticipations of the Future&quot;.&#x27; 

Viewed as a possible influence is Jack London&#x27;s 1907 novel &quot;The Iron Heel&quot;, with which &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; shares some similar themes, descriptions and its main narrative device (that of a work annotated by a future historian).&#x27; While &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; is a pro-socialist novel, some socialists take issue with that label due to the book&#x27;s racism and pessimistic attitudes.&#x27; The 1969 novel &quot;The Spook Who Sat by the Door&quot; by black author Sam Greenlee is also seen as a possible influence on &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;; the release of its film adaption was controversial and widely publicized. It follows the first black CIA agent, who then uses his knowledge to lead a black insurgency against the CIA. Greenlee described it as &quot;a training manual for guerrilla warfare&quot;, and all white characters in the book are racists who have exclusively hostile interactions with the protagonists. There are numerous depictions of violence, though unlike &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; the black insurgency&#x27;s intentions are not genocidal and violence is used in a targeted manner.&quot;&quot;

In Pierce&#x27;s authorized biography &quot;The Fame of a Dead Man&#x27;s Deeds&quot;, the anonymous 1959 novel &quot;The John Franklin Letters&quot; was cited by Pierce as the most direct inspiration for the novel. Similar to &quot;The John Franklin Letters&quot;, &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; utilizes a framing device where the events are prefaced by an in-universe future historian, though the historian in &quot;The John Franklin Letters&quot; says he will &quot;step aside&quot; to let the reader judge on their own. Pierce said that he had been given this book by Revilo P. Oliver, considered the most probable author of the novel. Oliver had written a review for &quot;Attack!&quot;, and in a meeting (likely in late 1974), Pierce expressed to Oliver that he was having difficulty getting people to respond to his message. Oliver asked him if he had considered writing fiction, as the kinds of people who would appreciate Pierce&#x27;s views just did not read the non-fiction material Pierce had previously written.

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; was published under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. It was originally published in a serial form in the National Alliance publication &quot;Attack!&quot; between 1975 and 1978, with one chapter released per issue during this period. Enthusiastic reactions among racist sympathizers led Pierce to self-publish the story as a paperback in 1978, with the distribution done by the National Alliance&#x27;s publishing arm National Vanguard Books. Its first edition was illustrated by artist Dennis Nix. 

&quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; was initially, until 1996, only sold via mail order from the National Alliance headquarters in West Virginia. Advertisements for the book played on gun rights, and the book was widely spread at gun shows in the United States. It was also sold at some book stores, but its largest method of distribution was through gun shows and venues like the Soldier of Fortune Convention as well as mail order advertisements in related publications like &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; magazine and &quot;Shotgun News&quot;. It had sold 200,000 copies by the late 1990s according to self-estimates generally considered reliable by scholars. By the end of 1999 estimates were at 250,000 copies, and 2001 estimates were at 300,000 copies. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Pierce was &quot;incredulous&quot; but also pleased that the book, written in haste, attracted as much attention as it did. 

In 1996, after the Oklahoma City bombing, Barricade Books published a new edition of the novel, including a foreword by the publisher denouncing it. Lyle Stuart, the owner of Barricade Books, was criticized by several organizations and individuals (among others, the SPLC, Morris Dees, the American Jewish Committee, the Simon Wiesenthal Center), who told major book chains to refuse to carry it. Dees stated that they had found the book in &quot;almost every single case&quot; of &quot;white supremacy, neo-Nazi, Ku Klux Klan-type activity that resulted in violence that caused deaths and injuries to many innocent people&quot;. Stuart defended his decision to republish the book by saying &quot;I felt it was important the average American see how sick these minds are and how dreadful and perverted their thinking process is&quot;. By the late 1990s, the book was widely distributed online.

A Finnish translation of the Turner Diaries was published in 1993 and sold by the National Democratic Party of Pekka Siitoin. A decade after the publication of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;, Pierce wrote another novel, &quot;Hunter&quot;, also under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. It was called by historian George Michael &quot;in some ways the sequel to&quot; the book. One interpretation of &quot;Hunter&quot; is that it is a prequel to &quot;the Turner Diaries&quot;, with the organization shown there becoming the Organization in &quot;Turner&quot;. In 1991, the National Alliance published another pseudonymous novel, &quot;Serpent&#x27;s Walk&quot;, which for some time was thought to have been written by Pierce, though it was published under a different pseudonym and was not listed in Pierce&#x27;s official biography.

=== Censorship ===
The book is prohibited in Canada as &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;hate propaganda&quot; literature. The book was made illegal in France in 1999 because of its advocacy of racism, anti-semitism and the use of violence. It has been banned in Germany since April 2006. 

In late 2020, online bookstore Amazon removed all new and used print and digital copies of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; from its bookselling platform, including all subsidiaries (AbeBooks, The Book Depository), effectively stopping sales of the title from the digital bookselling market. Although Amazon did not state a specific reason for the removal, it followed the company&#x27;s purge of a number of self-published and small-press titles connected with QAnon from its platform. The book had previously been on Amazon with a disclaimer noting its history of being associated with terrorist acts.

== Analysis ==
John Sutherland, in a 1996 essay for the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, said of the work that it &quot;is not the work of a Holocaust-denier (although Pierce gives us plenty of that) so much as a would-be Holocaust-repeater.&quot; &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; was described as being &quot;explicitly racist and anti-Semitic&quot; by Peter Applebome of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Applebome called it &quot;by almost any standard [...] a chilling read&quot;, &quot;almost compulsively violent&quot;. Ted Daniels said the characters were &quot;pure cardboard, amounting to nothing more than names and actions, heroic or squalid according to Pierce’s racist morality&quot; and that &quot;death is the only life in this book.&quot; Whites not of the Organization are presented in a harsh manner, portrayed as brainwashed and apathetic in contrast. Despite the book&#x27;s explicitly racist messaging, any time the word racist appears in reference to the Organization, it is done in quotations as if a false accusation.

Historian Kathleen Belew described the book as a valuable lens which researchers should look through in order to understand white nationalists, but she argued that it must be understood in context when it is studied, because &quot;It’s a book that has been used to kill a lot of people, over and over and over. [...] People should understand that’s what it is.&quot; Renee Brodie, writing for the &quot;Journal of American Culture&quot;, viewed the novel as having a premillennialist Christian ideology, with a &quot;primarily apocalyptic&quot; worldview as a whole, with the ethnically cleansed world at the end of the novel being paralleled by Macdonald with the Kingdom of God. Brodie wrote that by correlating Christian views with the Organization, the narrative shows the members of the group as having a &quot;single-mindedness of purpose&quot; that is &quot;one of the main attractions found in &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;&quot;. The System in the book is basically analogous to the Zionist Occupation Government (ZOG) conspiracy narrative.

== Legacy ==
The book was greatly influential in shaping white nationalism, and the later idea of the white genocide conspiracy theory. Terrorism analysts Bruce Hoffman and Jacob Ware said in their book &quot;God, Guns, and Sedition&quot; that &quot;no other book has had so pervasive or sustained an influence over violent far-right extremism in the United States as &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted its influence on white supremacists, describing some of its appeal as stemming from the book&#x27;s &quot;far-fetched&quot; plot. The Anti-Defamation League identified &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; as &quot;probably the most widely-read book among far-right extremists; many [of them] have cited it as the inspiration behind their terrorist organizing and activities.&quot; Researcher Martin Durham argued that despite the instances of terrorism inspired by the book, Pierce&#x27;s intention in writing it had probably not been to inspire such isolated cases earlier than he had wanted, with his aim instead having been to inspire &quot;real, organized terrorism done according to plan, aimed at bringing down the government&quot;.

It was allegedly labeled the &quot;bible of the racist right&quot; by the FBI. While it is widely quoted, the latter statement is apocryphal and was likely authored by Pierce, not the FBI, for the purpose of publicity. The label was included on the back of the book in its 1985 edition. An actual 1991 memorandum from the FBI described it as &quot;a significant work and foundation document closely embraced by the leadership as well as rank and file members of the Right-wing, White Supremist Movement&quot;.

The phrase &quot;Day of the Rope&quot;, in reference to the mass execution of &quot;race traitors&quot; in the novel, has also become common in white nationalist circles. The &quot;Day of the Rope&quot; concept is classified as a hate symbol in the Hate on Display hate symbols database of the Anti-Defamation League. The White Power band Bound for Glory referred to the phrase in their 1994 song &quot;The Hammer Falls Again (Ragnarok)&quot;, with the lyrics saying:

=== Terrorism ===

The book has inspired numerous hate crimes and acts of terrorism. It is estimated to have influenced the perpetrators of over 200 murders. Following the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, whose perpetrator, Timothy McVeigh, was fixated on the novel, the book was brought to greater public attention. Mark Potok of the SPLC said in the aftermath that &quot;William Pierce doesn’t build bombs. He builds bombers&quot;. Pierce&#x27;s stated opinion on the bombing varied; at one time Pierce denounced the bombing as a &quot;desperate and foolish&quot; action, as it was not part of a sustained campaign of terror designed to overthrow the government and it had not been at the right time. At other times, he said he did approve of the bombing.

In the wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, historian Kathleen Belew argued that the book was an inspiration to the rioters. She wrote that some actions in the attack appeared to be inspired by the book&#x27;s &quot;Day of the Rope&quot; and an attack on Congress in the book. She wrote that the book &quot;really becomes a clear point of reference if you look at the photographs of the action&quot;. Terrorism analysts Bruce Hoffman and Jacob Ware noted it as evoking the image of the &quot;Day of the Rope&quot;. 

The following terrorist attacks or hate crimes have been inspired by or linked to &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;:

* The Order (1983–1984) was a white supremacist, terrorist organization which named itself after the political organization which is discussed in &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. It formerly called itself &quot;The Organization&quot;. The Order murdered three people, including the talk radio host Alan Berg, and committed numerous robberies, counterfeiting operations, and acts of violence in an effort to provoke a race war in the United States.
* In 1983, inspired by &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;, three members of The Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord plotted to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building (later the target of the Oklahoma City Bombing) using a truck bomb; this plan did not go into action.
* In 1994, the Aryan Republican Army committed a string of armed bank robberies, at least 22; they were inspired both by the fictional The Order within the book and The Order organization that had itself been inspired by &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. One statement they recorded encouraged watchers to read the book. Members were also linked to the Oklahoma City bombing
*Timothy McVeigh, the perpetrator of the Oklahoma City bombing which killed 168 people in 1995, was found with pages from &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; in a plastic bag in his car after the attack. McVeigh stated while that he didn&#x27;t agree with the book&#x27;s racism, he agreed with its message on gun rights; J.M. Berger noted there was &quot;no clear indication that [McVeigh] subscribed to any specific white nationalist ideology, despite his fixation on the text.&quot; The book was the first piece of evidence introduced during his trial; witnesses testified that he was &quot;obsessed&quot; with the book, and sold it at gun shows. His attack was very similar to the truck bombing of the FBI headquarters in the book.
* Larry Wayne Shoemake, who committed a mass shooting against black people in Mississippi in 1996, had read both &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot;.
* Chevie Kehoe, who formed the white supremacist group the Aryan People&#x27;s Republic after he read &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;, started a murder spree in which he killed five people before he was captured in an armed shootout with police in 1997.
* John William King, was convicted of dragging James Byrd, an African American, to his death in Jasper, Texas, in 1998. As King shackled Byrd&#x27;s legs to his truck, he was reported to have said, &quot;We&#x27;re going to start &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; early.&quot;
* David Copeland, a British neo-Nazi who killed three people in a bombing campaign against London&#x27;s black and gay communities in 1999, quoted from &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; while being interviewed by police.
* Jacob D. Robida, who attacked a gay bar in Massachusetts in 2006, before fleeing and killing his ex-girlfriend and a police officer before committing suicide, was found to have a copy of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; and other Nazi propaganda in his home.
* Paul Ross Evans, who attempted to bomb an abortion clinic in 2006, was found to have the book in his apartment.
* The National Socialist Underground used a German translation of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; () in forming at least part of their ideological basis. Several members murdered at least ten people in a decade long murder spree. A copy of the was found on a computer used by the group, and most members had read it.
* Peter Mangs, a serial killer who targeted immigrants in Sweden from 2009–2010, had read both &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot;.
* Pavlo Lapshyn, a Ukrainian who committed a racist murder in Britain in 2013, had an audiobook of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; and he also had a Russian translation of &quot;Hunter&quot; in his possession.
* Frazier Glenn Miller Jr., who shot and killed three people at a Jewish community center in 2014, had praised the book.
* Zack Davies, who attempted to murder a Sikh man in a racist attack in Wales in 2015, was found to have a copy of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; and a copy of &quot;Hunter&quot; in his house.

<text>Warrior Soul is an American rock band formed by lead singer and producer Kory Clarke. Clarke started the band following a bet from a promoter at New York City&#x27;s Pyramid Club after a solo performance art show titled &quot;Kory Clarke/Warrior Soul&quot;. He was determined to have the best band in the city within six months. Nine months later, he signed a multi-album deal with Geffen Records.

==History==
Kory Clarke originally entered the music scene as a drummer for several bands, including Detroit punks L-Seven (not to be confused with the all-female Los Angeles band L7), Pennsylvania Southern rockers Raging Slab, and a Kim Fowley project called &quot;The Trial.&quot; After moving to New York City, Clarke began performing one-man shows in the realm of performance art. Although he believed rock bands to be less artistic, he was persuaded to reform a band, which he named Warrior Soul after a line in a George S. Patton docudrama.

The band began performing in New York City in 1987 and soon attracted the attention of Geffen, who signed them. Geffen directed Clarke to replace his hired band with new players. Clarke insisted on retaining Pete McClanahan as his bass player and recruited guitarist John Ricco and former Killing Joke drummer Paul Ferguson.

In 1990, Warrior Soul released their first album, &quot;Last Decade Dead Century&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia compared it to Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;, stating that although comparable success eluded Warrior Soul, it explored similar themes. Rivadavia speculated that the nihilism of &quot;Nevermind&quot; may have resonated more with Generation X.

In 1991, Mark Evans replaced Ferguson on drums, and the band released their second album, &quot;Drugs, God and the New Republic&quot;, which further amplified their anarchist leanings. A nationwide support tour with Queensrÿche (with whom they shared management from the Q Prime agency) followed.

The following year saw the release of the band&#x27;s third album, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Salutations from the Ghetto Nation&quot;, as Clarke&#x27;s relationship with Geffen soured. His interviews became increasingly bitter, often targeting the record label, which he accused of ignoring the group&#x27;s potential. Eventually, Clarke declared an all-out war, claiming that the band&#x27;s fourth release, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Chill Pill&quot;, had been deliberately botched to fulfill the band&#x27;s contract. This strategy appeared to be effective, and by early 1994, Warrior Soul was dropped by Geffen.

A series of lineup changes followed. Longtime guitarist John Ricco was ousted and replaced by two new guitarists: Alexander Arundel (also known as X-Factor and Gene Poole) and Chris Moffet (former Cycle Sluts from Hell lead guitarist). Not long after, Mark Evans and Chris Moffet departed. During this time, former Nuclear Assault/Cities/Cycle Sluts from Hell drummer Scott Duboys joined the band. The lineup now consisted of Clarke, Arundel, McClanahan, and Duboys. Clarke aimed to reinvent Warrior Soul as self-appointed cyberpunks for their fifth album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Space Age Playboys&quot;, released on the independent Futurist label. He also added old friend and collaborator Peter Jay on rhythm guitar. While touring in support of the album, Warrior Soul headlined the 1995 Kerrang! UK tour and performed at the 1995 Dynamo Open Air Festival, as well as the 1995 Donington Monsters of Rock concert.

After the performance of their last live show in September 1995, Arundel, Duboys, and longtime bassist McClanahan quit the band, leading to Clarke&#x27;s decision to retire Warrior Soul later that year.

In 1996, &quot;Odds &amp; Ends&quot; was released as a collection of demos recorded on an eight-track with Arundel, along with leftover material that was originally intended for release on Elektra Records.

The &quot;classic&quot; lineup of Clarke, Ricco, McClanahan, and Evans later reunited for a short tour and to enter the studio to re-record twelve of the band&#x27;s songs, which were released on Dream Catcher Records as &quot;Classics&quot; in 2000. All Warrior Soul albums were remastered and re-released on CD and MP3 in 2006 and 2009, including bonus material (mostly live songs originally released as B-sides). The first three albums were also re-released on vinyl in 2009.

Clarke states that many of their songs are politically based, such as &quot;Blown Away,&quot; &quot;Superpower Dreamland,&quot; &quot;In Conclusion,&quot; and &quot;Children of the Winter.&quot; He describes the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;acid punk,&quot; particularly their album &quot;The Space Age Playboys.&quot;

Drummer Mark Evans was murdered in London, England, in 2005, at the age of 48.

Bass player Pete McClanahan died at home in Cranston, Rhode Island, on 16 February 2022, at the age of 61.

==Reformation==
In 2007, Clarke revived the name and has been recording and touring with an ever-changing cast of musicians under the &quot;Warrior Soul&quot; moniker ever since.

Initially setting out on a tour of the UK, a live album soon followed. In 2008, the band released a new studio album, originally titled &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; (as a dig at the long-delayed Guns N&#x27; Roses release), but it was quickly renamed &quot;Destroy the War Machine&quot;.

In 2012, another new lineup released the studio album &quot;Stiff Middle Finger&quot;, co-produced by Sue Gere and Kory Clarke. This lineup featured Lundell still on guitar, joined by &quot;Johnny H&quot; and Xevi &quot;Strings&quot; Abellán, with Danny Engstrom and Sue Gere on bass and drums, respectively, played by Freddie Cocker Kvarnebrink. Former band member John Ricco made a guest appearance on guitar, as did The Mission guitarist Mark Gemini Thwaite. The band embarked on a month-long European tour in November 2012, followed by a brief tour through the Eastern United States in December. Original bass player Pete McClanahan joined the live lineup for a few months in 2013. Christian Kimmett joined the band on bass in 2013 after McClanahan&#x27;s departure, and Stevie Pearce joined on guitar a year later. This lineup undertook extensive touring in Europe and the US over the next three years, releasing a live album, &quot;Tough As Fuck&quot;, in 2016. In 2017, they released a new studio album—&quot;Back on the Lash&quot;—with yet another new lineup, which included the rhythm section from Urge Overkill, Adam and Nate Arling, joined by guitarist John &#x27;Full Throttle&#x27; Polachek.

In 2014, Clarke released a solo album recorded in Porto, Portugal, titled &quot;Payback&#x27;s A Bitch&quot;. Co-produced by Andre Indiana, with backing vocals by Monica Ferraz, this album showcased the diverse sides of Clarke&#x27;s musical abilities. Rolling Stone Germany awarded the album a full score.

==Musical style==
Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic described the band as &quot;an outspoken hard rock outfit,&quot; whose &quot;incendiary mix of anarchic art-rock and alternative heavy metal earned them a multi-album deal with Geffen Records.&quot;

<text>Altenburger Land is a district in Thuringia, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the district of Greiz, the Burgenlandkreis (Saxony-Anhalt), and the districts Leipzig, Mittelsachsen and Zwickau in Saxony. The district is a member of the Central German Metropolitan Region.

== Geography ==

Altenburger Land is the easternmost district of Thuringia. It is largely agricultural with three quarters of the total area being used for agriculture. In contrast, forests make up only around 10% of the area, especially in the south of the district there are only few forests. This can be explained by a high soil fertility with a Loess-layer of up to 3.5 meters.

The main river is the Pleiße, a tributary of the White Elster, crossing the district from south to north. The hilly Osterland constituting the northernmost foothills of the Ore Mountains slopes gently away to the plains of eastern Saxony-Anhalt.

== History ==

The region on the Pleiße River was part of a huge forest, where the Thuringii formed the Thuringian Kingdom. After this, the Kingdom was in 531 taken over by the Franks, Slavic people were also moving in. Thuringians reestablished independent rule. The castle of Altenburg already existed in the 10th century, it became an imperial seat. In the following centuries German settlers from other parts moved in. It was part of the Margravate of Meissen in the 14th century. At this time most of the forests were cleared.

The town of Altenburg and the surrounding lands were the tiny Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg from 1826 to 1918; afterwards it was a state within the Weimar Republic for a short time, before it was dissolved in 1922 in order to join the Free State of Thuringia.

The district in its present borders was established in 1922 under the name &quot;Altenburg&quot;. In 1952 there was an administrative reform splitting the districts into two smaller units, called &quot;Altenburg&quot; and &quot;Schmölln&quot;. They were merged again in 1994 under the name &quot;Altenburger Land&quot;.

=== Historical Population ===

== Politics ==
=== District Council ===

The 46 seats in the district council are distributed between the parties as follows since the Regional Elections in Thüringia 26th May 2024:

<doc id="191140" wikidata="Q931471" url="?curid=191140" title="Sick of It All">
<text>Sick of It All is an American hardcore punk band formed in 1986 in Queens, New York City. The band&#x27;s lineup consists of brothers Lou and Pete Koller on lead vocals and guitars respectively, Armand Majidi on drums, and Craig Setari on bass. Sick of It All is considered a major part of the New York hardcore scene, and by 2020, the band had sold at least half a million records worldwide.

Though their 1989 debut album &quot;Blood, Sweat and No Tears&quot; was a moderate success, Sick of It All did not achieve commercial success until later albums. After the release of their second album &quot;Just Look Around&quot; in 1992, East West Records saw the band&#x27;s potential and signed them in 1993. Sick of It All&#x27;s third and major label debut album, &quot;Scratch the Surface&quot;, was released in 1994 to critical acclaim and included the singles &quot;Scratch the Surface&quot; and &quot;Step Down&quot;. They released one more album on East West, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Built to Last&quot;, before signing with Fat Wreck Chords in 1998, which released the band&#x27;s next three studio albums. They signed to Abacus Records afterwards, a subsidiary of Century Media. This label released their eighth studio album &quot;Death to Tyrants&quot; in 2006 to positive reviews (Abacus eventually went out of business, though Sick of It All would remain on Century Media, which released the band&#x27;s next three albums). Sick of It All&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Wake the Sleeping Dragon!&quot;, was released in 2018.

==History==

===Early career (1986–1992)===
Formed in 1986, the members met while attending Francis Lewis High School in Queens, New York City, the band was formed by Lou Koller on bass and vocals, Pete Koller on guitar and David Lamb on drums. The Koller brothers originally intended for their first band to be named &quot;General Chaos&quot;, however Lamb proposed calling the band &quot;Sick of All&quot;, with the intent to abbreviate it to S.O.A. Lou pointed out that another band existed with that name and decided to expand the name to &quot;Sick of It All&quot;. After recruiting bassist Mark McNeely, the band played their first show on Saturday May 17, 1986, just a month after they formed, at the Right Track Inn in Long Island, supporting Youth of Today, Straight Ahead and Crippled Youth. After this performance, Lamb and McNeely left the band, leading to the brothers hiring Rich Cipriano as bassist and Armand Majidi as a &quot;fill-in&quot; drummer. This lineup also played its first show at the Right Track. The band recorded the &quot;Sick of It All&quot; demo in 1987 and the band began to play Sunday afternoon matinees at renowned venue CBGB&#x27;s, and soon after released a self-titled 7&quot; on Revelation Records (which was later re-issued on the tenth anniversary of its release, in 1997).

In 1988, Sick of It All signed to Relativity Records and recorded their first full-length, &quot;Blood, Sweat and No Tears&quot;, which was released in 1989. This was followed by the studio/live EP &quot;We Stand Alone&quot; (1991), and their second studio album &quot;Just Look Around&quot; (1992).

===Rising popularity (1993–1997)===
Sick of It All released their record &quot;Scratch the Surface&quot; on major label EastWest Records. They also recorded a video for &quot;Step Down&quot; and the title track &quot;Scratch The Surface&quot;. The record was the first recorded with long-time friend and former Straight Ahead, Rest in Pieces, Youth of Today and Agnostic Front bass player Craig Setari, who had replaced Rich Cipriano, in early 1993.

The fair success of &quot;Scratch the Surface&quot; allowed the band to tour worldwide. In 1997, they released their next record on the EastWest sister label Elektra, &quot;Built to Last&quot;. This record featured a number of live staples for the band, including &quot;Us vs. Them&quot;, &quot;Busted&quot; and &quot;Good Lookin&#x27; Out&quot;. Sick of It All toured with Napalm Death and Sepultura during the album cycle. The album also marked the end of Sick of It All&#x27;s contractual agreement with EastWest.

===The Fat Wreck Chords years (1998–2004)===
In 1998, Sick of It All signed to independent record label Fat Wreck Chords, owned and run by Fat Mike of NOFX. After releasing the &quot;Potential for a Fall&quot; single – for which another video was filmed, &quot;Call To Arms&quot; was released in February 1999.

The 2000 follow-up &quot;Yours Truly&quot; was less critically acclaimed. Despite containing some of the band&#x27;s favored live tracks, including &quot;Blown Away&quot;, &quot;The Bland Within&quot;, &quot;District&quot; and &quot;America&quot;, some fans felt alienated by the album&#x27;s progressive nature and in a recent interview, frontman Lou Koller claimed that the album&#x27;s cover art probably contributed to its poor reception.

In 2001, Sick of It All released their home video &quot;The Story So Far,&quot; and a year later a live record was released as part of Fat Wreck Chords&#x27; &quot;Live in a Dive&quot; series. The album showcased tracks from Sick of It All&#x27;s entire career up to that point in time.

2003 saw Sick of It All release their seventh studio album: &quot;Life on the Ropes&quot;. In 2004, the band also released an album of B-sides, covers and rare tracks entitled &quot;Outtakes for the Outcast,&quot; which contains some Sick of It All recordings.

===&quot;Death to Tyrants&quot; (2005–2007)===

In early 2005, Sick of It All signed to Abacus Recordings to record the follow-up to Fat Wreck Chords&#x27; &quot;Life on the Ropes&quot;. The new album, titled &quot;Death to Tyrants&quot;, was released on April 18, 2006. The band toured with AFI and The Dear &amp; Departed in early 2007.

A tribute to the band, titled &quot;Our Impact Will Be Felt&quot;, was released on April 24, 2007, and includes covers from artists such as Bane, Bleeding Through, the Bouncing Souls, Ignite, Comeback Kid, Hatebreed, Himsa, Madball, Most Precious Blood, Napalm Death, Pennywise, Rise Against, Sepultura, Stretch Arm Strong, the Suicide Machines, Unearth, and Walls of Jericho.

===&quot;Based on a True Story&quot; (2008–2013)===
Following a worldwide tour in support of &quot;Death to Tyrants&quot;, Sick of It All began working on new material for their next album. In an August 2009 interview with singer Lou Koller, he revealed that the band would begin recording their new album in November for a 2010 release. &quot;Based on a True Story&quot;, the first Sick of It All album in four years, was released on April 20, 2010. Sick of It All also toured in Australia with Rise Against to support their &quot;Endgame&quot; tour in 2011. They also toured the UK with AFI and Dear &amp; Departed in April 2010.

In 2011, the band released &quot;XXV Nonstop&quot; on Century Media to celebrate the band&#x27;s 25 year career, which was a selection of re-recorded songs from the band&#x27;s discography. 

===&quot;Last Act of Defiance&quot; and &quot;Wake the Sleeping Dragon!&quot; (2014–present)===
In November 2011, singer Lou Koller revealed to AbsolutePunk writer Dre Okorley that Sick of It All had begun writing a follow-up to &quot;Based on a True Story&quot;. He stated: &quot;Right now we&#x27;re concentrating on writing our new record, inspired by the last two tours we&#x27;ve done with different bands. We have some really good lyrics and tons of songs done. We&#x27;ll see what happens. We&#x27;ve just got a lotta good stuff coming up.&quot; The album, tilted &quot;Last Act of Defiance&quot;, was released on September 30, 2014.

Sick of It All toured Great Britain and Ireland from January to February 2015.

Sick of It All spent much of 2016 celebrating their 30th anniversary with a worldwide tour. To coincide with this anniversary, the band released an EP of new material, &quot;When the Smoke Clears&quot;, on November 4, 2016.

By December 2016, Sick of It All had begun working on their twelfth studio album, &quot;Wake the Sleeping Dragon!&quot;, which was released on November 2, 2018.

In June 2024, Sick of It All cancelled an upcoming European tour set to begin in July. Following the announcement, vocalist Lou Koller revealed his diagnosis with an esophageal tumor, which would require treatment over the course of the summer.

<doc id="191142" wikidata="Q1537558" url="?curid=191142" title="Milpa">
<text>In agriculture, a milpa is a field for growing food crops and a crop-growing system used throughout Mesoamerica, especially in the Yucatán Peninsula, in Mexico. The word &quot;milpa&quot; derives from the Nahuatl words &quot;milli&quot; and &quot;pan&quot;. Based on the agronomy of the Maya and of other Mesoamerican peoples, the &quot;milpa&quot; system is used to produce crops of maize, beans, and squash without employing artificial pesticides and artificial fertilizers.

The land-conservation cycle of the milpa is two years of cultivation and eight years of laying fallow. In the Mexican states of Jalisco and Michoacán and in central Mexico as well as Guanacaste Province Costa Rica, as an agricultural term &quot;milpa&quot; denotes a single corn plant; in El Salvador and Guatemala, &quot;milpa&quot; specifically refers to harvested crop of maize and the field for cultivation.

The concept of &quot;milpa&quot; is a sociocultural construct rather than simply a system of agriculture. It involves complex interactions and relationships between farmers, as well as distinct personal relationships with both the crops and land. For example, it has been noted that &quot;the making of &quot;milpa&quot; is the central, most sacred act, one which binds together the family, the community, the universe ... [it] forms the core institution of Indian society in Mesoamerica and its religious and social importance often appear to exceed its nutritional and economic importance.&quot;

Milpitas, California, derives its name from the Nahuatl term &quot;milpa&quot; followed by the Spanish feminine diminutive plural suffix &quot;-itas&quot;.

<text>In developmental psychology and moral, political, and bioethical philosophy, autonomy is the capacity to make an informed, uncoerced decision. Autonomous organizations or institutions are independent or self-governing. Autonomy can also be defined from a human resources perspective, where it denotes a (relatively high) level of discretion granted to an employee in his or her work. In such cases, autonomy is known to generally increase job satisfaction. Self-actualized individuals are thought to operate autonomously of external expectations. In a medical context, respect for a patient&#x27;s personal autonomy is considered one of many fundamental ethical principles in medicine.

==Sociology==
In the sociology of knowledge, a controversy over the boundaries of autonomy inhibited analysis of any concept beyond relative autonomy, until a typology of autonomy was created and developed within science and technology studies. According to it, the institution of science&#x27;s existing autonomy is &quot;reflexive autonomy&quot;: actors and structures within the scientific field are able to translate or to reflect diverse themes presented by social and political fields, as well as influence them regarding the thematic choices on research projects.

===Institutional autonomy===
Institutional autonomy is having the capacity as a legislator to be able to implant and pursue official goals. Autonomous institutions are responsible for finding sufficient resources or modifying their plans, programs, courses, responsibilities, and services accordingly. But in doing so, they must contend with any obstacles that can occur, such as social pressure against cut-backs or socioeconomic difficulties. From a legislator&#x27;s point of view, to increase institutional autonomy, conditions of self-management and institutional self-governance must be put in place. An increase in leadership and a redistribution of decision-making responsibilities would be beneficial to the research of resources.

Institutional autonomy was often seen as a synonym for self-determination, and many governments feared that it would lead institutions to an irredentist or secessionist region. But autonomy should be seen as a solution to self-determination struggles. Self-determination is a movement toward independence, whereas autonomy is a way to accommodate the distinct regions/groups within a country. Institutional autonomy can diffuse conflicts regarding minorities and ethnic groups in a society. Allowing more autonomy to groups and institutions helps create diplomatic relationships between them and the central government.

==Politics==

In governmental parlance, autonomy refers to self-governance. An example of an autonomous jurisdiction was the former United States governance of the Philippine Islands. The &quot;Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916&quot; provided the framework for the creation of an autonomous government under which the Filipino people had broader domestic autonomy than previously, although it reserved certain privileges to the United States to protect its sovereign rights and interests. Other examples include Kosovo (as the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo) under the former Yugoslav government of Marshal Tito and Puntland Autonomous Region within Federal Republic of Somalia.

Although often being territorially defined as self-governments, autonomous self-governing institutions may take a non-territorial form. Such non-territorial solutions are, for example, cultural autonomy in Estonia and Hungary, national minority councils in Serbia or Sámi parliaments in Nordic countries.

==Philosophy==
Autonomy is a key concept that has a broad impact on different fields of philosophy. In metaphysical philosophy, the concept of autonomy is referenced in discussions about free will, fatalism, determinism, and agency. In moral philosophy, autonomy refers to subjecting oneself to objective moral law.

=== According to Kant ===
Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) defined autonomy by three themes regarding contemporary ethics. Firstly, autonomy as the right for one to make their own decisions excluding any interference from others. Secondly, autonomy as the capacity to make such decisions through one&#x27;s own independence of mind and after personal reflection. Thirdly, as an ideal way of living life autonomously. In summary, autonomy is the moral right one possesses, or the capacity we have in order to think and make decisions for oneself providing some degree of control or power over the events that unfold within one&#x27;s everyday life.

The context in which Kant addresses autonomy is in regards to moral theory, asking both foundational and abstract questions. He believed that in order for there to be morality, there must be autonomy. &quot;Autonomous&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;autonomos&quot; where &#x27;auto&#x27; means self and &#x27;nomos&#x27; means to govern (&quot;nomos&quot;: as can be seen in its usage in &quot;nomárchēs&quot; which means chief of the province). Kantian autonomy also provides a sense of rational autonomy, simply meaning one rationally possesses the motivation to govern their own life. Rational autonomy entails making your own decisions but it cannot be done solely in isolation. Cooperative rational interactions are required to both develop and exercise our ability to live in a world with others.

Kant argued that morality presupposes this autonomy () in moral agents, since moral requirements are expressed in categorical imperatives. An imperative is categorical if it issues a valid command independent of personal desires or interests that would provide a reason for obeying the command. It is hypothetical if the validity of its command, if the reason why one can be expected to obey it, is the fact that one desires or is interested in something further that obedience to the command would entail. &quot;Don&#x27;t speed on the freeway if you don&#x27;t want to be stopped by the police&quot; is a hypothetical imperative. &quot;It is wrong to break the law, so don&#x27;t speed on the freeway&quot; is a categorical imperative. The hypothetical command not to speed on the freeway is not valid for you if you do not care whether you are stopped by the police. The categorical command is valid for you either way. Autonomous moral agents can be expected to obey the command of a categorical imperative even if they lack a personal desire or interest in doing so. It remains an open question whether they will, however.

The Kantian concept of autonomy is often misconstrued, leaving out the important point about the autonomous agent&#x27;s self-subjection to the moral law. It is thought that autonomy is fully explained as the ability to obey a categorical command independently of a personal desire or interest in doing so—or worse, that autonomy is &quot;obeying&quot; a categorical command independently of a natural desire or interest; and that heteronomy, its opposite, is acting instead on personal motives of the kind referenced in hypothetical imperatives.

In his &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals&quot;, Kant applied the concept of autonomy also to define the concept of personhood and human dignity. Autonomy, along with rationality, are seen by Kant as the two criteria for a meaningful life. Kant would consider a life lived without these not worth living; it would be a life of value equal to that of a plant or insect. According to Kant autonomy is part of the reason that we hold others morally accountable for their actions. Human actions are morally praise- or blame-worthy in virtue of our autonomy. Non- autonomous beings such as plants or animals are not blameworthy due to their actions being non-autonomous. Kant&#x27;s position on crime and punishment is influenced by his views on autonomy. Brainwashing or drugging criminals into being law-abiding citizens would be immoral as it would not be respecting their autonomy. Rehabilitation must be sought in a way that respects their autonomy and dignity as human beings.

=== According to Nietzsche ===
Friedrich Nietzsche wrote about autonomy and the moral fight. Autonomy in this sense is referred to as the free self and entails several aspects of the self, including self-respect and even self-love. This can be interpreted as influenced by Kant (self-respect) and Aristotle (self-love). For Nietzsche, valuing ethical autonomy can dissolve the conflict between love (self-love) and law (self-respect) which can then translate into reality through experiences of being self-responsible. Because Nietzsche defines having a sense of freedom with being responsible for one&#x27;s own life, freedom and self-responsibility can be very much linked to autonomy.

=== According to Piaget ===
The Swiss philosopher Jean Piaget (1896–1980) believed that autonomy comes from within and results from a &quot;free decision&quot;. It is of intrinsic value and the morality of autonomy is not only accepted but obligatory. When an attempt at social interchange occurs, it is reciprocal, ideal and natural for there to be autonomy regardless of why the collaboration with others has taken place. For Piaget, the term autonomous can be used to explain the idea that rules are self-chosen. By choosing which rules to follow or not, we are in turn determining our own behaviour.

Piaget studied the cognitive development of children by analyzing them during their games and through interviews, establishing (among other principles) that the children&#x27;s moral maturation process occurred in two phases, the first of heteronomy and the second of autonomy:
* Heteronomous reasoning: Rules are objective and unchanging. They must be literal because the authority are ordering it and do not fit exceptions or discussions. The base of the rule is the superior authority (parents, adults, the State), that it should not give reason for the rules imposed or fulfilled them in any case. Duties provided are conceived as given from oneself. Any moral motivation and sentiments are possible through what one believes to be right.
* Autonomous reasoning: Rules are the product of an agreement and, therefore, are modifiable. They can be subject to interpretation and fit exceptions and objections. The base of the rule is its own acceptance, and its meaning has to be explained. Sanctions must be proportionate to the absence, assuming that sometimes offenses can go unpunished, so that collective punishment is unacceptable if it is not the guilty. The circumstances may not punish a guilty. Duties provided are conceived as given from the outside. One follows rules mechanically as it is simply a rule, or as a way to avoid a form of punishment.

=== According to Kohlberg ===
The American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1927–1987) continues the studies of Piaget. His studies collected information from different latitudes to eliminate the cultural variability, and focused on the moral reasoning, and not so much in the behavior or its consequences. Through interviews with adolescent and teenage boys, who were to try and solve &quot;moral dilemmas&quot;, Kohlberg went on to further develop the stages of moral development. The answers they provided could be one of two things. Either they choose to obey a given law, authority figure or rule of some sort or they chose to take actions that would serve a human need but in turn break this given rule or command.

The most popular moral dilemma asked involved the wife of a man approaching death due to a special type of cancer. Because the drug was too expensive to obtain on his own, and because the pharmacist who discovered and sold the drug had no compassion for him and only wanted profits, he stole it. Kohlberg asks these adolescent and teenage boys (10-, 13- and 16-year-olds) if they think that is what the husband should have done or not. Therefore, depending on their decisions, they provided answers to Kohlberg about deeper rationales and thoughts and determined what they value as important. This value then determined the &quot;structure&quot; of their moral reasoning.

Kohlberg established three stages of morality, each of which is subdivided into two levels. They are read in progressive sense, that is, higher levels indicate greater autonomy.
* Level 1: Premoral/Preconventional Morality: Standards are met (or not met) depending on the hedonistic or physical consequences.
** [Stage 0: Egocentric Judgment: There is no moral concept independent of individual wishes, including a lack of concept of rules or obligations.]
** Stage 1: Punishment-Obedience Orientation: The rule is obeyed only to avoid punishment. Physical consequences determine goodness or badness and power is deferred to unquestioningly with no respect for the human or moral value, or the meaning of these consequences. Concern is for the self.
** Stage 2: Instrumental-Relativist Orientation: Morals are individualistic and egocentric. There is an exchange of interests but always under the point of view of satisfying personal needs. Elements of fairness and reciprocity are present but these are interpreted in a pragmatic way, instead of an experience of gratitude or justice. Egocentric in nature but beginning to incorporate the ability to see things from the perspective of others.
* Level 2: Conventional Morality/Role Conformity: Rules are obeyed according to the established conventions of a society.
** Stage 3: Good Boy–Nice Girl Orientation: Morals are conceived in accordance with the stereotypical social role. Rules are obeyed to obtain the approval of the immediate group and the right actions are judged based on what would please others or give the impression that one is a good person. Actions are evaluated according to intentions.
** Stage 4: Law and Order Orientation: Morals are judged in accordance with the authority of the system, or the needs of the social order. Laws and order are prioritized.
* Level 3: Postconventional Morality/Self-Accepted Moral Principles: Standards of moral behavior are internalized. Morals are governed by rational judgment, derived from a conscious reflection on the recognition of the value of the individual inside a conventionally established society.
** Stage 5: Social Contract Orientation: There are individual rights and standards that have been lawfully established as basic universal values. Rules are agreed upon by through procedure and society comes to consensus through critical examination in order to benefit the greater good.
** Stage 6: Universal Principle Orientation: Abstract ethical principles are obeyed on a personal level in addition to societal rules and conventions. Universal principles of justice, reciprocity, equality and human dignity are internalized and if one fails to live up to these ideals, guilt or self-condemnation results.

=== According to Audi ===
Robert Audi characterizes autonomy as the self-governing power to bring reasons to bear in directing one&#x27;s conduct and influencing one&#x27;s propositional attitudes. Traditionally, autonomy is only concerned with practical matters. But, as Audi&#x27;s definition suggests, autonomy may be applied to responding to reasons at large, not just to practical reasons. Autonomy is closely related to freedom but the two can come apart. An example would be a political prisoner who is forced to make a statement in favor of his opponents in order to ensure that his loved ones are not harmed. As Audi points out, the prisoner lacks freedom but still has autonomy since his statement, though not reflecting his political ideals, is still an expression of his commitment to his loved ones.

Autonomy is often equated with self-legislation in the Kantian tradition. Self-legislation may be interpreted as laying down laws or principles that are to be followed. Audi agrees with this school in the sense that we should bring reasons to bear in a principled way. Responding to reasons by mere whim may still be considered free but not autonomous. A commitment to principles and projects, on the other hand, provides autonomous agents with an identity over time and gives them a sense of the kind of persons they want to be. But autonomy is neutral as to which principles or projects the agent endorses. So different autonomous agents may follow very different principles. But, as Audi points out, self-legislation is not sufficient for autonomy since laws that do not have any practical impact do not constitute autonomy. Some form of motivational force or executive power is necessary in order to get from mere self-legislation to self-government. This motivation may be inherent in the corresponding practical judgment itself, a position known as &quot;motivational internalism&quot;, or may come to the practical judgment externally in the form of some desire independent of the judgment, as &quot;motivational externalism&quot; holds.

In the Humean tradition, intrinsic desires are the reasons the autonomous agent should respond to. This theory is called &quot;instrumentalism&quot;. Audi rejects instrumentalism and suggests that we should adopt a position known as &quot;axiological objectivism&quot;. The central idea of this outlook is that objective values, and not subjective desires, are the sources of normativity and therefore determine what autonomous agents should do.

==Child development==
Autonomy in childhood and adolescence is when one strives to gain a sense of oneself as a separate, self-governing individual. Between ages 1–3, during the second stage of Erikson&#x27;s and Freud&#x27;s stages of development, the psychosocial crisis that occurs is autonomy versus shame and doubt. The significant event that occurs during this stage is that children must learn to be autonomous, and failure to do so may lead to the child doubting their own abilities and feel ashamed. When a child becomes autonomous it allows them to explore and acquire new skills. Autonomy has two vital aspects wherein there is an emotional component where one relies more on themselves rather than their parents and a behavioural component where one makes decisions independently by using their judgement. The styles of child rearing affect the development of a child&#x27;s autonomy. Autonomy in adolescence is closely related to their quest for identity. In adolescence parents and peers act as agents of influence. Peer influence in early adolescence may help the process of an adolescent to gradually become more autonomous by being less susceptible to parental or peer influence as they get older. In adolescence the most important developmental task is to develop a healthy sense of autonomy.

==Religion==
In Christianity, autonomy is manifested as a partial self-governance on various levels of church administration. During the history of Christianity, there were two basic types of autonomy. Some important parishes and monasteries have been given special autonomous rights and privileges, and the best known example of monastic autonomy is the famous Eastern Orthodox monastic community on Mount Athos in Greece. On the other hand, administrative autonomy of entire ecclesiastical provinces has throughout history included various degrees of internal self-governance.

In ecclesiology of Eastern Orthodox Churches, there is a clear distinction between autonomy and autocephaly, since autocephalous churches have full self-governance and independence, while every autonomous church is subject to some autocephalous church, having a certain degree of internal self-governance. Since every autonomous church had its own historical path to ecclesiastical autonomy, there are significant differences between various autonomous churches in respect of their particular degrees of self-governance. For example, churches that are autonomous can have their highest-ranking bishops, such as an archbishop or metropolitan, appointed or confirmed by the patriarch of the mother church from which it was granted its autonomy, but generally they remain self-governing in many other respects.

In the history of Western Christianity the question of ecclesiastical autonomy was also one of the most important questions, especially during the first centuries of Christianity, since various archbishops and metropolitans in Western Europe have often opposed centralizing tendencies of the Church of Rome. , the Catholic Church comprises 24 autonomous (&quot;sui iuris&quot;) Churches in communion with the Holy See. Various denominations of Protestant churches usually have more decentralized power, and churches may be autonomous, thus having their own rules or laws of government, at the national, local, or even individual level.

Sartre brings the concept of the Cartesian god being totally free and autonomous. He states that existence precedes essence with god being the creator of the essences, eternal truths and divine will. This pure freedom of god relates to human freedom and autonomy; where a human is not subjected to pre-existing ideas and values.

According to the first amendment, In the United States of America, the federal government is restricted in building a national church. This is due to the first amendment&#x27;s recognizing people&#x27;s freedom&#x27;s to worship their faith according to their own belief&#x27;s. For example, the American government has removed the church from their &quot;sphere of authority&quot; due to the churches&#x27; historical impact on politics and their authority on the public. This was the beginning of the disestablishment process. The Protestant churches in the United States had a significant impact on American culture in the nineteenth century, when they organized the establishment of schools, hospitals, orphanages, colleges, magazines, and so forth. This has brought up the famous, however, misinterpreted term of the separation of church and state. These churches lost the legislative and financial support from the state.

=== The disestablishment process ===
The first disestablishment began with the introduction of the bill of rights. In the twentieth century, due to the great depression of the 1930s and the completion of the second world war, the American churches were revived. Specifically the Protestant churches. This was the beginning of the second disestablishment when churches had become popular again but held no legislative power. One of the reasons why the churches gained attendance and popularity was due to the baby boom, when soldiers came back from the second world war and started their families. The large influx of newborns gave the churches a new wave of followers. However, these followers did not hold the same beliefs as their parents and brought about the political, and religious revolutions of the 1960s.

During the 1960s, the collapse of religious and cultural middle brought upon the third disestablishment. Religion became more important to the individual and less so to the community. The changes brought from these revolutions significantly increased the personal autonomy of individuals due to the lack of structural restraints giving them added freedom of choice. This concept is known as &quot;new voluntarism&quot; where individuals have free choice on how to be religious and the free choice whether to be religious or not.

==Medicine==
In a medical context, respect for a patient&#x27;s personal autonomy is considered one of many fundamental ethical principles in medicine. Autonomy can be defined as the ability of the person to make his or her own decisions. This faith in autonomy is the central premise of the concept of informed consent and shared decision making. This idea, while considered essential to today&#x27;s practice of medicine, was developed in the last 50 years. According to Tom Beauchamp and James Childress (in &quot;Principles of Biomedical Ethics&quot;), the Nuremberg trials detailed accounts of horrifyingly exploitative medical &quot;experiments&quot; which violated the subjects&#x27; physical integrity and personal autonomy. These incidences prompted calls for safeguards in medical research, such as the Nuremberg Code which stressed the importance of voluntary participation in medical research. It is believed that the Nuremberg Code served as the premise for many current documents regarding research ethics.

Respect for autonomy became incorporated in health care and patients could be allowed to make personal decisions about the health care services that they receive. Notably, autonomy has several aspects as well as challenges that affect health care operations. The manner in which a patient is handled may undermine or support the autonomy of a patient and for this reason, the way a patient is communicated to becomes very crucial. A good relationship between a patient and a health care practitioner needs to be well defined to ensure that autonomy of a patient is respected. Just like in any other life situation, a patient would not like to be under the control of another person. The move to emphasize respect for patient&#x27;s autonomy rose from the vulnerabilities that were pointed out in regards to autonomy.

However, autonomy does not only apply in a research context. Users of the health care system have the right to be treated with respect for their autonomy, instead of being dominated by the physician. This is referred to as paternalism. While paternalism is meant to be overall good for the patient, this can very easily interfere with autonomy. Through the therapeutic relationship, a thoughtful dialogue between the client and the physician may lead to better outcomes for the client, as he or she is more of a participant in decision-making.

There are many different definitions of autonomy, many of which place the individual in a social context. Relational autonomy, which suggests that a person is defined through their relationships with others, is increasingly considered in medicine and particularly in critical and end-of-life care. Supported autonomy suggests instead that in specific circumstances it may be necessary to temporarily compromise the autonomy of the person in the short term in order to preserve their autonomy in the long-term. Other definitions of the autonomy imagine the person as a contained and self-sufficient being whose rights should not be compromised under any circumstance.

There are also differing views with regard to whether modern health care systems should be shifting to greater patient autonomy or a more paternalistic approach. For example, there are such arguments that suggest the current patient autonomy practiced is plagued by flaws such as misconceptions of treatment and cultural differences, and that health care systems should be shifting to greater paternalism on the part of the physician given their expertise.  On the other hand, other approaches suggest that there simply needs to be an increase in relational understanding between patients and health practitioners to improve patient autonomy.

One argument in favor of greater patient autonomy and its benefits is by Dave deBronkart, who believes that in the technological advancement age, patients are capable of doing a lot of their research on medical issues from their home. According to deBronkart, this helps to promote better discussions between patients and physicians during hospital visits, ultimately easing up the workload of physicians. deBronkart argues that this leads to greater patient empowerment and a more educative health care system. In opposition to this view, technological advancements can sometimes be viewed as an unfavorable way of promoting patient autonomy. For example, self-testing medical procedures which have become increasingly common are argued by Greaney et al. to increase patient autonomy, however, may not be promoting what is best for the patient. In this argument, contrary to deBronkart, the current perceptions of patient autonomy are excessively over-selling the benefits of individual autonomy, and is not the most suitable way to go about treating patients. Instead, a more inclusive form of autonomy should be implemented, relational autonomy, which factors into consideration those close to the patient as well as the physician. These different concepts of autonomy can be troublesome as the acting physician is faced with deciding which concept he/she will implement into their clinical practice. It is often references as one of the four pillars of medicine, alongside beneficence, justice and nonmaleficence

Autonomy varies and some patients find it overwhelming especially the minors when faced with emergency situations. Issues arise in emergency room situations where there may not be time to consider the principle of patient autonomy. Various ethical challenges are faced in these situations when time is critical, and patient consciousness may be limited. However, in such settings where informed consent may be compromised, the working physician evaluates each individual case to make the most professional and ethically sound decision. For example, it is believed that neurosurgeons in such situations, should generally do everything they can to respect patient autonomy. In the situation in which a patient is unable to make an autonomous decision, the neurosurgeon should discuss with the surrogate decision maker in order to aid in the decision-making process. Performing surgery on a patient without informed consent is in general thought to only be ethically justified when the neurosurgeon and his/her team render the patient to not have the capacity to make autonomous decisions. If the patient is capable of making an autonomous decision, these situations are generally less ethically strenuous as the decision is typically respected.

Not every patient is capable of making an autonomous decision. For example, a commonly proposed question is at what age children should be partaking in treatment decisions. This question arises as children develop differently, therefore making it difficult to establish a standard age at which children should become more autonomous. Those who are unable to make the decisions prompt a challenge to medical practitioners since it becomes difficult to determine the ability of a patient to make a decision. To some extent, it has been said that emphasis of autonomy in health care has undermined the practice of health care practitioners to improve the health of their patient as necessary. The scenario has led to tension in the relationship between a patient and a health care practitioner. This is because as much as a physician wants to prevent a patient from suffering, they still have to respect autonomy. Beneficence is a principle allowing physicians to act responsibly in their practice and in the best interests of their patients, which may involve overlooking autonomy. However, the gap between a patient and a physician has led to problems because in other cases, the patients have complained of not being adequately informed.

The seven elements of informed consent (as defined by Beauchamp and Childress) include threshold elements (competence and voluntariness), information elements (disclosure, recommendation, and understanding) and consent elements (decision and authorization). Some philosophers such as Harry Frankfurt consider Beauchamp and Childress criteria insufficient. They claim that an action can only be considered autonomous if it involves the exercise of the capacity to form higher-order values about desires when acting intentionally. What this means is that patients may understand their situation and choices but would not be autonomous unless the patient is able to form value judgements about their reasons for choosing treatment options they would not be acting autonomously.

In certain unique circumstances, government may have the right to temporarily override the right to bodily integrity in order to preserve the life and well-being of the person. Such action can be described using the principle of &quot;supported autonomy&quot;, a concept that was developed to describe unique situations in mental health (examples include the forced feeding of a person dying from the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, or the temporary treatment of a person living with a psychotic disorder with antipsychotic medication). While controversial, the principle of supported autonomy aligns with the role of government to protect the life and liberty of its citizens. Terrence F. Ackerman has highlighted problems with these situations, he claims that by undertaking this course of action physician or governments run the risk of misinterpreting a conflict of values as a constraining effect of illness on a patient&#x27;s autonomy.

Since the 1960s, there have been attempts to increase patient autonomy including the requirement that physician&#x27;s take bioethics courses during their time in medical school. Despite large-scale commitment to promoting patient autonomy, public mistrust of medicine in developed countries has remained. Onora O&#x27;Neill has ascribed this lack of trust to medical institutions and professionals introducing measures that benefit themselves, not the patient. O&#x27;Neill claims that this focus on autonomy promotion has been at the expense of issues like distribution of healthcare resources and public health.

One proposal to increase patient autonomy is through the use of support staff. The use of support staff including medical assistants, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, and other staff that can promote patient interests and better patient care. Nurses especially can learn about patient beliefs and values in order to increase informed consent and possibly persuade the patient through logic and reason to entertain a certain treatment plan. This would promote both autonomy and beneficence, while keeping the physician&#x27;s integrity intact. Furthermore, Humphreys asserts that nurses should have professional autonomy within their scope of practice (35–37). Humphreys argues that if nurses exercise their professional autonomy more, then there will be an increase in patient autonomy (35–37).

==International human rights law==
After the Second World War, there was a push for international human rights that came in many waves. Autonomy as a basic human right started the building block in the beginning of these layers alongside liberty. The Universal declarations of Human rights of 1948 has made mention of autonomy or the legal protected right to individual self-determination in article 22.

Documents such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples reconfirm international law in the aspect of human rights because those laws were already there, but it is also responsible for making sure that the laws highlighted when it comes to autonomy, cultural and integrity; and land rights are made within an indigenous context by taking special attention to their historical and contemporary events

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples article 3 also through international law provides Human rights for Indigenous individuals by giving them a right to self-determination, meaning they have all the liberties to choose their political status, and are capable to go and improve their economic, social, and cultural statuses in society, by developing it. Another example of this, is article 4 of the same document which gives them autonomous rights when it comes to their internal or local affairs and how they can fund themselves in order to be able to self govern themselves.

Minorities in countries are also protected as well by international law; the 27th article of the United Nations International covenant on Civil and Political rights or the ICCPR does so by allowing these individuals to be able to enjoy their own culture or use their language. Minorities in that manner are people from ethnic religious or linguistic groups according to the document.

The European Court of Human rights, is an international court that has been created on behalf of the European Conventions of Human rights. However, when it comes to autonomy they did not explicitly state it when it comes to the rights that individuals have. The current article 8 has remedied to that when the case of &quot;Pretty v the United Kingdom&quot;, a case in 2002 involving assisted suicide, where autonomy was used as a legal right in law. It was where Autonomy was distinguished and its reach into law was marked as well making it the foundations for legal precedent in making case law originating from the European Court of Human rights.

The Yogyakarta Principles, a document with no binding effect in international human rights law, contend that &quot;self-determination&quot; used as meaning of autonomy on one&#x27;s own matters including informed consent or sexual and reproductive rights, is integral for one&#x27;s self-defined or gender identity and refused any medical procedures as a requirement for legal recognition of the gender identity of transgender. If eventually accepted by the international community in a treaty, this would make these ideas human rights in the law. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also defines autonomy as principles of rights of a person with disability including &quot;the freedom to make one&#x27;s own choices, and independence of persons&quot;.

==Celebrity culture on teenage autonomy==
A study conducted by David C. Giles and John Maltby conveyed that after age-affecting factors were removed, a high emotional autonomy was a significant predictor of celebrity interest, as well as high attachment to peers with a low attachment to parents. Patterns of intense personal interest in celebrities was found to be conjunction with low levels of closeness and security. Furthermore, the results suggested that adults with a secondary group of pseudo-friends during development from parental attachment, usually focus solely on one particular celebrity, which could be due to difficulties in making this transition.

==Various uses==
* In computing, an autonomous peripheral is one that can be used with the computer turned off.
* Within self-determination theory in psychology, autonomy refers to &#x27;autonomy support versus control&#x27;, &quot;hypothesizing that autonomy-supportive social contexts tend to facilitate self-determined motivation, healthy development, and optimal functioning.&quot;
* In mathematical analysis, an ordinary differential equation is said to be autonomous if it is time-independent.
* In linguistics, an autonomous language is one which is independent of other languages, for example, has a standard variety, grammar books, dictionaries or literature, etc.
* In robotics, &quot;autonomy means independence of control. This characterization implies that autonomy is a property of the relation between two agents, in the case of robotics, of the relations between the designer and the autonomous robot. Self-sufficiency, situatedness, learning or development, and evolution increase an agent&#x27;s degree of autonomy.&quot;, according to Rolf Pfeifer.
* In spaceflight, autonomy can also refer to crewed missions that are operating without control by ground controllers.
* In economics, autonomous consumption is consumption expenditure when income levels are zero, making spending &quot;autonomous&quot; to income.
* In politics, autonomous territories are States wishing to retain territorial integrity in opposition to ethnic or indigenous demands for self-determination or independence (sovereignty).
* In anti-establishment activism, an autonomous space is another name for a non-governmental social center or free space (for community interaction).
* In social psychology, autonomy is a personality trait characterized by a focus on personal achievement, independence, and a preference for solitude, often labeled as an opposite of sociotropy.

== Limits to autonomy ==
Autonomy can be limited. For instance, by disabilities, civil society organizations may achieve a degree of autonomy albeit nested within—and relative to—formal bureaucratic and administrative regimes. Community partners can therefore assume a hybridity of capture and autonomy—or a mutuality—that is rather nuanced.

===Semi-autonomy===
The term &quot;semi-autonomy&quot; (coined with prefix semi- / &quot;half&quot;) designates partial or limited autonomy. As a relative term, it is usually applied to various semi-autonomous entities or processes that are substantially or functionally limited, in comparison to other fully autonomous entities or processes.

===Quasi-autonomy===
The term &quot;quasi-autonomy&quot; (coined with prefix quasi- / &quot;resembling&quot; or &quot;appearing&quot;) designates formally acquired or proclaimed, but functionally limited or constrained autonomy. As a descriptive term, it is usually applied to various quasi-autonomous entities or processes that are formally designated or labeled as autonomous, but in reality remain functionally dependent or influenced by some other entity or process. An example for such use of the term can be seen in common designation for quasi-autonomous non-governmental organizations.

Shortly after completing initial training, &quot;New Mexico&quot; escorted the ship that carried President Woodrow Wilson to Brest, France to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Thereafter she was made the first flagship of the newly created United States Pacific Fleet. The interwar period was marked by repeated exercises with the Pacific and Atlantic Fleets, use as a trial ship for PID controllers, and a major modernization between March 1931 and January 1933. &quot;New Mexico&quot;&#x27;s first actions during World War II were neutrality patrols in the Atlantic Ocean. She returned to the Pacific after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and participated in shore bombardments during operations at Attu and Kiska, Tarawa, the Marshall Islands, the Mariana and Palau islands, Leyte, Luzon, and Okinawa; these were interspersed with escort duties, patrols, and refits. The ship was attacked by &quot;kamikazes&quot; on several occasions. &quot;New Mexico&quot; was awarded six battle stars for her service in the Pacific campaign and was present in Tokyo Bay for Japan&#x27;s formal surrender on 2 September 1945. Four days later, she sailed for the United States and arrived in Boston on 17 October.

&quot;New Mexico&quot; was decommissioned in Boston on 19 July 1946 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 February 1947. She was sold for scrapping to the Lipsett Division of Luria Bros in November 1947, but attempts to bring her to Newark, New Jersey for breaking up were met with resistance from city officials. City fireboats were sent to block the passage of the battleship and the Lipsett tugboats, while the United States Coast Guard declared intentions to guarantee safe passage. The Under Secretary of the Navy Department was sent to defuse what the media began to call the &quot;Battle of Newark Bay&quot;; the city agreed to break up &quot;New Mexico&quot; and two other battleships before scrapping operations in Newark Bay ceased, while Lipsett was instructed to dismantle the ships in a set timeframe or suffer financial penalties. Scrapping commenced in November and was completed by July 1948.

== Description ==
&quot;New Mexico&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. Unlike the other members of her class, &quot;New Mexico&quot; was powered by four-shaft General Electric steam turbines fitted with turbo-electric transmission and nine oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers rated at , generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her crew numbered 1,084 officers and enlisted men. As built, she was fitted with two lattice masts with spotting tops for the main gun battery. The main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces on barbettes. The conning tower had thick sides.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve /50 caliber guns in four, three-gun turrets on the centerline, placed in two superfiring pairs forward and aft of the superstructure. Unlike earlier American battleships with triple turrets, these mounts were true three-gun barrels, in that each barrel could elevate independently. The secondary battery consisted of fourteen /51 caliber guns mounted in individual casemates clustered in the superstructure amidships. Initially, the ship was fitted with twenty-two of the guns, but experiences in the North Sea during World War I demonstrated that the additional guns, which were placed in the hull, would have been unusable in anything but calm seas. As a result, these guns were removed and the casemates were plated over to prevent flooding. The secondary battery was augmented with four /50 caliber guns. In addition to her gun armament, &quot;New Mexico&quot; was also fitted with two torpedo tubes, mounted submerged in the hull, one on each broadside.

== Service history ==
On 30 June 1914, &quot;New Mexico&quot; was authorized by the United States Congress. Initially, &quot;New Mexico&quot; was to have been named &quot;California&quot;, but she was renamed while under construction. Work on the new ship began on 14 October 1915, with her keel laying at the New York Navy Yard. She was launched on 13 April 1917, and commissioned into the fleet on 20 May 1918. Captain Ashley Herman Robertson was her first commanding officer. The ship thereafter began sea trials and a shakedown cruise before formally joining the Atlantic Fleet. In September, she was transferred to Boston. She was present during a naval review held on 26 December in New York City. She escorted the passenger ship as she carried President Woodrow Wilson to France for the Versailles Peace Conference, departing the United States on 15 January 1919. On 22 February, &quot;New Mexico&quot; encountered a foundering schooner; after taking off the sinking ship&#x27;s crew, &quot;New Mexico&quot;″s secondary battery used the vessel for target practice. On 27 February, the ship reached New York, and in mid-July, she had moved to Hampton Roads, Virginia. On 16 July, she became the flagship of the Pacific Fleet. Three days later, she left for California, passing through the Panama Canal and arriving in San Pedro on 9 August. Two of her 5-inch/51 caliber guns were removed in a later overhaul, in 1922.

The next twelve years consisted of training exercises and maneuvers in the Pacific and the Caribbean, with the Pacific and the Atlantic Fleets. She also took several cruises to South American ports and was used for the early development of PID controllers. Invented by the Russian-American engineer Nicolas Minorsky for the automated steering of ships, the devices have since become widespread in control engineering. After that, in 1925, she took a cruise to Australia and New Zealand.

After her training exercises in the Atlantic and the Pacific were finished, &quot;New Mexico&quot; was overhauled and modernized at the Philadelphia Harbor by the Navy from March 1931 to January 1933. The overhaul included the replacement of her turbo-electric drive with more conventional geared turbines, which were made by Curtis. In addition, &quot;New Mexico&quot; received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed. After the overhaul, she returned the Pacific to continue training exercises and the development of tactical operations. &quot;New Mexico&#x27;s&quot; performance during these exercises garnered numerous awards, particularly in gunnery, engineering, and battlefield efficiency; she subsequently became known as the &quot;Queen&quot; or &quot;Queen of the Fleet&quot; by her crew.

During the 1936 Fleet Problem XVII, she had a maximum speed of , in line with most U.S. Standard-type battleship of that time, but only faster than Japan&#x27;s slowest battleships. This led to the development of the faster and &quot;South Dakota&quot;-class battleship. In 1937, she arrived in Hawaii to sail to Dutch Harbor, Alaska, where she and several other ships were sent to help the Navy evaluate fighting in sub-arctic conditions.

=== World War II ===

==== 1940–43 ====
As the prospect of war grew, &quot;New Mexico&quot; was based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, from 6 December 1940 to 20 May 1941. She then left Pearl Harbor to join the Atlantic fleet at Norfolk on 16 June for neutrality patrol duty along the Atlantic coast. In the Atlantic, she served on three 7- to 14-day &quot;shifts&quot; following destroyers to escort convoys across the Atlantic. On 10 December, while headed to Hampton Roads (en route to the west coast after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor), she accidentally rammed and sank the U.S. freighter south of the Nantucket Lightship off Boston Harbor. The owner of &quot;Oregon&quot; sued the federal government for the loss of the ship, but the courts found &quot;New Mexico&quot; blameless in the collision. She managed to reach the Panama Canal by 17 January 1942.

During an overhaul in May 1942, at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, she had her remaining secondary battery of twelve 5–inch/51 guns reduced to either 8 or 6 to make space for more anti-aircraft guns. After the overhaul, which was completed on 1 August, she departed San Francisco to Hawaii to prepare for action. From 6 December to 22 March 1943, she escorted convoys and transports to the Fiji Islands. After that, she patrolled the southwestern Pacific, before returning to Pearl Harbor to get ready for the Aleutian Islands Campaign. After her training, on 17 May, she steamed to Adak, which would be her base for the attack on Attu. She later participated in the shelling of Kiska on 21 July, which preceded the Japanese evacuation of the island a week later.

After the Aleutian Islands Campaign, a refit was undertaken at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. On 25 October, &quot;New Mexico&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor to practice for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. On 20 November, while the invasion was under way, she shelled Makin Atoll. During the fighting on the islands the ship was tasked with guarding transports at night when they retreated from the islands, providing anti-aircraft fire for the unloading of supplies and troops, and providing screening fire for the aircraft carriers. After U.S. troops captured the Gilbert Islands on 5 December, &quot;New Mexico&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor.

==== 1944 ====
&quot;New Mexico&quot; was part of the Marshall Islands invasion force on 12 January 1944. She shelled Kwajalein and Ebeye from 31 January to 1 February. Replenishing at Majuro, on 20 February the ship shelled Wotje, and then the following month also shelled New Ireland and Kavieng. After that, she sailed to the Solomon Islands to practice the attack on the Mariana Islands, stopping at Sydney, in Australia, on the way.

In mid-June, &quot;New Mexico&quot; joined the shelling of Tinian, and also bombarded Saipan and Guam. On 18 June, she helped drive away two air attacks. Later, on 20 June, she escorted transports off the Mariana Islands. Meanwhile, the carrier task force destroyed the Japanese carrier force at the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Later, she escorted troop transports to the naval base of Eniwetok. On 9 July, she sailed to guard escort carriers until 12 July. Her guns later hit Guam on 21 July and kept on shelling the island until 30 July.

After the invasion of the Mariana Islands, she received an overhaul at Bremerton, Washington, from October to November. After the overhaul, she arrived in Leyte Gulf to escort reinforcement and supply transports and convoys. She dealt with daily air attacks, as the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the liberation of the Philippines. She departed Leyte Gulf on 2 December to the Palaus, where she later joined a Mindoro-bound convoy. She provided anti-aircraft fire for the convoy and provided cover fire for invading forces. She provided cover for two more days before retiring to the Palaus.

==== 1945 ====
&quot;New Mexico&quot;″s next task in the Philippines was the liberation of Luzon. She took part in the pre-invasion shelling of Lingayen Gulf on 6 January. During the bombardment she came under heavy attack by &quot;kamikazes&quot;, one of which hit her bridge, killing her commanding officer, Captain Robert Walton Fleming, and 29 others. The dead included Lieutenant General Herbert Lumsden, the British representative to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. Lumsden was the most senior British Army combat fatality of World War II. A further 87 of her crew were wounded. Bruce Fraser, the commander of the British Pacific Fleet, narrowly escaped death while on her bridge, although his secretary was killed. The guns remained in action as the ship&#x27;s crew repaired the damage while the invasion troops were landing on the beaches.

More extensive repairs were completed at Pearl Harbor, after which &quot;New Mexico&quot; sailed to the island of Ulithi, where she was assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54), the fire-support group for the invasion of Okinawa. Her heavy guns opened up on Okinawa on 26 March, and for the next month she continued to support the US troops ashore. On 11 May, she destroyed eight &quot;Shinyo&quot; suicide boats.

While she was approaching her berth in the Hagushi anchorage, just after sunset on 12 May, &quot;New Mexico&quot; was attacked by two &quot;kamikazes;&quot; one plunged into her, the other hit her with its bomb. She was set on fire and 54 crew members were killed, with a further 119 wounded. Swift action led to the fires being extinguished within 30 minutes. On 28 May, &quot;New Mexico&quot; departed for repairs at Leyte, followed by rehearsals for the planned invasion of Japan. News of the war&#x27;s end reached her when she was at Saipan on 15 August; the next day she sailed for Okinawa to join the occupation force. She entered Sagami Wan on 27 August to support the airborne occupation of Atsugi Airfield. The next day &quot;New Mexico&quot; passed into Tokyo Bay to witness the Japanese surrender, which took place on 2 September. She departed Tokyo Bay on 6 September, passing Okinawa, Hawaii, and the Panama Canal, before arriving at Boston on 17 October.

=== Postwar ===
&quot;New Mexico&quot; was decommissioned in Boston on 19 July 1946 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 February 1947. On 9 November 1947, she was sold for scrapping to the Lipsett Division of Luria Bros, for $381,600.

Lipsett decided to tow &quot;New Mexico&quot; for scrapping at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines made it an ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 &quot;New Mexico&quot; departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while off the coast of New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the tow lines. Running lights were kept on aboard &quot;New Mexico&quot; along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually lost sight of the battleship. &quot;New Mexico&quot; then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 miles off the coast. The two tugs then secured tow lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard.

Newark city officials decided they did not want any more ships scrapped along the city&#x27;s waterfront. Newark was implementing a beautification plan for the waterfront, and had allocated $70 million for improvements. As such, the city declared that any attempt to bring &quot;New Mexico&quot; to Newark would be blocked. Two city fireboats, &quot;Michael P. Duffy&quot; and &quot;William T. Brennan&quot;, were dispatched and were prepared to use their fire hoses and chemical sprayers to halt Lipsett and &quot;New Mexico&quot;. In response, Lipsett organized its own force of four tugs, and the United States Coast Guard declared it would guarantee safe passage of &quot;New Mexico&quot;, provided legal entry was permitted. This showdown was dubbed by the press as the &quot;Battle of Newark Bay&quot;, while the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce announced it would protest Newark&#x27;s &quot;slur&quot; of &quot;New Mexico&#x27;s&quot; namesake, through its refusal to admit the battleship.

As &quot;New Mexico&quot; awaited suitable tidal conditions to make the final tow into Newark, the Navy Department sent Under Secretary W. John Kenney to negotiate. After several sessions, he arranged a tenuous agreement between the City of Newark and Lipsett. Newark would allow &quot;New Mexico&quot; and two other battleships, and , to be scrapped at Newark, but there would be no permanent ship dismantling facility. Lipsett had nine months to dispose of the three ships, or would be subjected to a fine of $1,000 per day after the deadline.

&quot;New Mexico&quot; finally entered Newark Channel on 19 November, and was greeted by the same Newark fireboats that had earlier been sent to oppose the ship. Newark also arranged to have school children honor the old battleship dockside, with a marching band. &quot;New Mexico&quot; was subsequently joined by &quot;Idaho&quot; and &quot;Wyoming&quot;, where all three were finally dismantled. Scrapping of &quot;New Mexico&quot; began on 24 November and was completed by July 1948.

Two ship&#x27;s bells from the battleship were donated to the state of New Mexico. The larger bell was on display at the Santa Fe Plaza from 1948 until the early 1970s and is now part of the New Mexico History Museum collection. The smaller bell was sent to the University of New Mexico, where it hung in Scholes Hall from 1948 to 1964 and subsequently in its own freestanding tower near Smith Plaza.

<text>Paramecium ( , , plural &quot;paramecia&quot; only when used as a vernacular name) is a genus of eukaryotic, unicellular ciliates, widespread in freshwater, brackish, and marine environments. Paramecia are often abundant in stagnant basins and ponds. Because some species are readily cultivated and easily induced to conjugate and divide, they have been widely used in classrooms and laboratories to study biological processes. &quot;Paramecium&quot; species are commonly studied as model organisms of the ciliate group and have been characterized as the &quot;white rats&quot; of the phylum Ciliophora.

==Historical background==

&quot;Paramecium&quot; were among the first ciliates to be observed by microscopists, in the late 17th century. They were most likely known to the Dutch pioneer of protozoology, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, and were clearly described by his contemporary Christiaan Huygens in a letter from 1678. The earliest known illustration of a &quot;Paramecium&quot; species was published anonymously in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1703.

In 1718, the French mathematics teacher and microscopist Louis Joblot published a description and illustration of a microscopic (fish), which he discovered in an infusion of oak bark in water. Joblot gave this creature the name , or &quot;slipper&quot;, and the phrase &quot;slipper animalcule&quot; remained in use as a colloquial epithet for &quot;Paramecium&quot;, throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.

The name &quot;Paramecium&quot; – constructed from the Greek (&quot;paramēkēs&quot;, &quot;oblong&quot;) – was coined in 1752 by the English microscopist John Hill, who applied the name generally to &quot;Animalcules which have no visible limbs or tails, and are of an irregularly oblong figure.&quot; In 1773, O. F. Müller, the first researcher to place the genus within the Linnaean system of taxonomy, adopted the name &quot;Paramecium&quot; but changed the spelling to &quot;Paramæcium.&quot; In 1783, Johann Hermann changed the spelling once more, to &quot;Paramœcium&quot;. C. G. Ehrenberg, in a major study of the infusoria published in 1838, restored Hill&#x27;s original spelling for the name, and most researchers have followed his lead.

==Description==
Species of &quot;Paramecium&quot; range in size from 0.06 mm to 0.3 mm in length. Cells are typically ovoid, elongate, or foot- or cigar-shaped.

The body of the cell is enclosed by a stiff but elastic structure called the pellicle. The pellicle consists of an outer cell membrane (plasma membrane), a layer of flattened membrane-bound sacs called &quot;alveoli&quot;, and an inner membrane called the &quot;epiplasm&quot;. The pellicle is not smooth, but textured with hexagonal or rectangular depressions. Each of these polygons is perforated by a central aperture through which a single cilium projects. Between the alveolar sacs of the pellicle, most species of &quot;Paramecium&quot; have closely spaced spindle-shaped trichocysts, explosive organelles that discharge thin, non-toxic filaments, often used for defensive purposes.

Typically, an anal pore (cytoproct) is located on the ventral surface, in the posterior half of the cell. In all species, there is a deep oral groove running from the anterior of the cell to its midpoint. This is lined with inconspicuous cilia which beat continuously, drawing food into the cell. &quot;Paramecium&quot; are primarily heterotrophic, feeding on bacteria and other small organisms. A few species are mixotrophs, deriving some nutrients from endosymbiotic algae (chlorella) carried in the cytoplasm of the cell.

Osmoregulation is carried out by contractile vacuoles, which actively expel water from the cell to compensate for fluid absorbed by osmosis from its surroundings. The number of contractile vacuoles varies depending on the species.

== Movement ==

A &quot;Paramecium&quot; propels itself by whip-like movements of the cilia, which are arranged in tightly spaced rows around the outside of the body. The beat of each cilium has two phases: a fast &quot;effective stroke,&quot; during which the cilium is relatively stiff, followed by a slow &quot;recovery stroke,&quot; during which the cilium curls loosely to one side and sweeps forward in a counter-clockwise fashion. The densely arrayed cilia move in a coordinated fashion, with waves of activity moving across the &quot;ciliary carpet,&quot; creating an effect sometimes likened to that of the wind blowing across a field of grain.

The &quot;Paramecium&quot; spirals through the water as it progresses. When it happens to encounter an obstacle, the &quot;effective stroke&quot; of its cilia is reversed and the organism swims backward for a brief time, before resuming its forward progress. This is called the avoidance reaction. If it runs into the solid object again, it repeats this process, until it can get past the object.

It has been calculated that a &quot;Paramecium&quot; expends more than half of its energy in propelling itself through the water. This ciliary method of locomotion has been found to be less than 1% efficient. This low percentage is nevertheless close to the maximum theoretical efficiency that can be achieved by an organism equipped with cilia as short as those of the members of &quot;Paramecium.&quot;

==Gathering food==

&quot;Paramecium&quot; feed on microorganisms such as bacteria, algae, and yeasts. To gather food, the &quot;Paramecium&quot; makes movements with cilia to sweep prey organisms, along with some water, through the oral groove (vestibulum, or vestibule), and into the cell. The food passes from the cilia-lined oral groove into a narrower structure known as the buccal cavity (gullet). From there, food particles pass through a small opening called the cytostome, or cell mouth, and move into the interior of the cell. As food enters the cell, it is gathered into food vacuoles, which are periodically closed off and released into the cytoplasm, where they begin circulating through the cell body by the streaming movement of the cell contents, a process called cyclosis or cytoplasmic streaming. As a food vacuole moves along, enzymes from the cytoplasm enter it, to digest the contents. As enzymatic digestion proceeds, the vacuole contents become more acidic. Within five minutes of a vacuole&#x27;s formation, the pH of its contents drops from 7 to 3. As digested nutrients pass into the cytoplasm, the vacuole shrinks. When the fully digested vacuole reaches the anal pore, it ruptures, expelling its waste contents outside the cell.

== Symbiosis ==
Some species of &quot;Paramecium&quot; form mutualistic relationships with other organisms. &quot;Paramecium bursaria&quot; and &quot;Paramecium chlorelligerum&quot; harbour endosymbiotic green algae, from which they derive nutrients and a degree of protection from predators such as &quot;Didinium nasutum&quot;. Numerous bacterial endosymbionts have been identified in species of &quot;Paramecium&quot;. Some intracellular bacteria, known as kappa particles, give &quot;Paramecium&quot; the ability to kill other strains of &quot;Paramecium&quot; that lack kappa particles.

== Genome ==
The genome of the species &quot;Paramecium tetraurelia&quot; has been sequenced, providing evidence for three whole-genome duplications.

In some ciliates, like &quot;Stylonychia&quot; and &quot;Paramecium&quot;, only UGA is decoded as a stop codon, while UAG and UAA are reassigned as sense codons (that is, codons that code for standard amino acids), coding for the amino acid glutamic acid.

== Learning ==
The question of whether &quot;Paramecium&quot; exhibit learning has been the object of a great deal of experimentation, yielding equivocal results. However, a study published in 2006 seems to show that &quot;Paramecium caudatum&quot; may be trained, through the application of a 6.5 volt electric current, to discriminate between brightness levels. This experiment has been cited as a possible instance of cell memory, or epigenetic learning in organisms with no nervous system.

==Reproduction and sexual phenomena==

=== Reproduction ===
Like all ciliates, &quot;Paramecium&quot; have a dual nuclear apparatus, consisting of a polyploid macronucleus, and one or more diploid micronuclei. The macronucleus controls non-reproductive cell functions, expressing the genes needed for daily functioning. The micronucleus is the generative, or germline nucleus, containing the genetic material that is passed along from one generation to the next.

&quot;Paramecium&quot; reproduction is asexual, by binary fission, which has been characterized as &quot;the sole mode of reproduction in ciliates&quot; (conjugation being a sexual phenomenon, not directly resulting in increase of numbers). During fission, the macronucleus splits by a type of amitosis, and the micronuclei undergo mitosis. The cell then divides transversally, and each new cell obtains a copy of the micronucleus and the macronucleus.

Fission may occur spontaneously, in the course of the vegetative cell cycle. Under certain conditions, it may be preceded by self-fertilization (autogamy), or it may immediately follow conjugation, in which &quot;Paramecium&quot; of compatible mating types fuse temporarily and exchange genetic material.

==== Conjugation ====

In ciliates such as &quot;Paramecium&quot;, conjugation is a sexual phenomenon that results in genetic recombination and nuclear reorganization within the cell. During conjugation, two &quot;Paramecium&quot; of a compatible mating type come together and form a bridge between their cytoplasms. Their respective micronuclei undergo meiosis, and haploid micronuclei are exchanged over the bridge. Following conjugation, the cells separate. The old macronuclei are destroyed, and both post-conjugants form new macronuclei, by amplification of DNA in their micronuclei. Conjugation is followed by one or more &quot;exconjugant divisions.&quot;

;Stages of conjugation

In &quot;Paramecium caudatum&quot;, the stages of conjugation are as follows (see diagram at right):
# Compatible mating strains meet and partly fuse
# The micronuclei undergo meiosis, producing four haploid micronuclei per cell.
# Three of these micronuclei disintegrate. The fourth undergoes mitosis.
# The two cells exchange a micronucleus.
# The cells then separate.
# The micronuclei in each cell fuse, forming a diploid micronucleus. 
# Mitosis occurs three times, giving rise to eight micronuclei.
# Four of the new micronuclei transform into macronuclei, and the old macronucleus disintegrates.
# Binary fission occurs twice, yielding four identical daughter cells.

==Aging==
In the asexual fission phase of growth, during which cell divisions occur by mitosis rather than meiosis, clonal aging occurs leading to a gradual loss of vitality. In some species, such as the well studied &quot;Paramecium tetraurelia&quot;, the asexual line of clonally aging &quot;Paramecium&quot; loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo autogamy or conjugation. The basis for clonal aging was clarified by transplantation experiments of Aufderheide in 1986. When macronuclei of clonally young &quot;Paramecium&quot; were injected into &quot;Paramecium&quot; of standard clonal age, the lifespan (clonal fissions) of the recipient was prolonged. In contrast, transfer of cytoplasm from clonally young &quot;Paramecium&quot; did not prolong the lifespan of the recipient. These experiments indicated that the macronucleus, rather than the cytoplasm, is responsible for clonal aging. Other experiments by Smith-Sonneborn, Holmes and Holmes, and Gilley and Blackburn demonstrated that, during clonal aging, DNA damage increases dramatically. Thus, DNA damage in the macronucleus appears to be the cause of aging in &quot;P. tetraurelia&quot;. In this single-celled protist, aging appears to proceed as it does in multicellular eukaryotes, as described in DNA damage theory of aging.

==Meiosis and rejuvenation==

When clonally aged &quot;P. tetraurelia&quot; are stimulated to undergo meiosis in association with either conjugation or automixis, the genetic descendants are rejuvenated, and are able to have many more mitotic binary fission divisions. During conjugation or automixis, the micronuclei of the cell(s) undergo meiosis, the old macronucleus disintegrates, and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear DNA that had recently undergone meiosis. There is apparently little, if any, DNA damage in the new macronucleus. These findings further support the idea that clonal aging is due, in large part, to a progressive accumulation of DNA damage; and that rejuvenation is due to the repair of this damage in the micronucleus during meiosis. Meiosis appears to be an adaptation for DNA repair and rejuvenation in &quot;P. tetraurelia&quot;. In &quot;P. tetraurelia&quot;, CtlP protein is a key factor needed for the completion of meiosis during sexual reproduction and recovery of viable sexual progeny. The CtlP and Mre11 nuclease complex are essential for accurate processing and repair of double-strand breaks during homologous recombination.

The adaptive benefit of meiosis and self-fertilization in response to starvation appears to be independent of the generation of any new genetic variation in &quot;P. tetraurelia&quot;. This observation suggests that the underlying molecular mechanism of meiosis provides a fitness advantage regardless of any concomitant effect of sex on genetic diversity.

<doc id="191156" wikidata="Q422011" url="?curid=191156" title="Monazite">
<text>Monazite is a primarily reddish-brown phosphate mineral that contains rare-earth elements. Due to variability in composition, monazite is considered a group of minerals. The most common species of the group is monazite-(Ce), that is, the cerium-dominant member of the group. It occurs usually in small isolated crystals. It has a hardness of 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness and is relatively dense, about 4.6 to 5.7 g/cm3. There are five different most common species of monazite, depending on the relative amounts of the rare earth elements in the mineral:
* monazite-(Ce), (the most common member),
* monazite-(La), ,
* monazite-(Nd), ,
* monazite-(Sm), ,
* monazite-(Pr), .

The elements in parentheses are listed in the order of their relative proportion within the mineral: lanthanum is the most common rare-earth element in monazite-(La), and so forth. Silica () is present in trace amounts, as well as small amounts of uranium and thorium. Due to the alpha decay of thorium and uranium, monazite contains a significant amount of helium, which can be extracted by heating.

The following analyses are of monazite from: (I.) Burke County, North Carolina, US; (II.) Arendal, Norway; (III.) Emmaville, New South Wales, Australia.
Monazite is an important ore for thorium, lanthanum, and cerium. It is often found in placer deposits. India, Madagascar, and South Africa have large deposits of monazite sands. The deposits in India are particularly rich in monazite.

Monazite is radioactive due to the presence of thorium and, less commonly, uranium. The radiogenic decay of uranium and thorium to lead enables monazite to be dated through monazite geochronology. Monazite crystals often have multiple distinct zones that formed through successive geologic events that lead to monazite crystallization. These domains can be dated to gain insight into the geologic history of its host rocks.

The name monazite comes from the (to be solitary), via German &quot;Monazit&quot;, in allusion to its isolated crystals.

==Structure==

All monazites adopt the same structure, meaning that the connectivity of the atoms is very similar to other compounds of the type . The M(III) centers have a distorted coordination sphere being surrounded by eight oxides with M–O distances around 2.6 Å in length. The phosphate anion is tetrahedral, as usual. The same structural motif is observed for lead chromate (). Monazite also shares many structural similarities with; zircon, xenotime, scheelite, anhydrite, barite, and rhabdophane.

==Mining history==

Monazite sand from Brazil was first noticed in sand carried in ship&#x27;s ballast by Carl Auer von Welsbach in the 1880s. Von Welsbach was looking for thorium for his newly invented incandescent mantles. Monazite sand was quickly adopted as the thorium source and became the foundation of the rare-earth industry.

Monazite sand was also briefly mined in North Carolina, but, shortly thereafter, extensive deposits in southern India were found. Brazilian and Indian monazite dominated the industry before World War II, after which major mining activity transferred to South Africa. There are also large monazite deposits in Australia.

Monazite was the only significant source of commercial lanthanides, but because of concern over the disposal of the radioactive daughter products of thorium, bastnäsite came to displace monazite in the production of lanthanides in the 1960s due to its much lower thorium content. Increased interest in thorium for nuclear energy may bring monazite back into commercial use.

==Mineralization and extraction==
Because of their high density, monazite minerals concentrate in alluvial sands when released by the weathering of pegmatites. These so-called placer deposits are often beach or fossil beach sands and contain other heavy minerals of commercial interest such as zircon and ilmenite. Monazite can be isolated as a nearly pure concentrate by the use of gravity, magnetic, and electrostatic separation.

Monazite sand deposits are prevalently of the monazite-(Ce) composition. Typically, the lanthanides in such monazites contain about 45–48% cerium, about 24% lanthanum, about 17% neodymium, about 5% praseodymium, and minor quantities of samarium, gadolinium, and yttrium. Europium concentrations tend to be low, about 0.05%. South African &quot;rock&quot; monazite, from Steenkampskraal, was processed in the 1950s and early 1960s by the Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash and Chemical Corporation, at the time the largest producer of lanthanides in the world. Steenkampskraal monazite provided a supply of the complete set of lanthanides. Very low concentrations of the heaviest lanthanides in monazite justified the term &quot;rare&quot; earth for these elements, with prices to match. Thorium content of monazite is variable and sometimes can be up to 20–30%. Monazite from certain carbonatites or from Bolivian tin ore veins is essentially thorium-free. However, commercial monazite sands typically contain between 6 and 12% thorium oxide.

=== Acid cracking ===
The original process for &quot;cracking&quot; monazite so as to extract the thorium and lanthanide content was to heat it with concentrated sulfuric acid to temperatures between for several hours. Variations in the ratio of acid to ore, the extent of heating, and the extent to which water was added afterwards led to several different processes to separate thorium from the lanthanides. One of the processes caused the thorium to precipitate out as a phosphate or pyrophosphate in crude form, leaving a solution of lanthanide sulfates, from which the lanthanides could be easily precipitated as a double sodium sulfate. The acid methods led to the generation of considerable acid waste, and loss of the phosphate content of the ore.
=== Alkaline cracking ===
A more recent process uses hot sodium hydroxide solution (73%) at about . This process allows the valuable phosphate content of the ore to be recovered as crystalline trisodium phosphate. The lanthanide/thorium hydroxide mixture can be treated with hydrochloric acid to provide a solution of lanthanide chlorides, and an insoluble sludge of the less-basic thorium hydroxide.
===Extraction of rare-earth metals from monazite ore===

The extraction of rare-earth metals from monazite ore begins with digestion with sulfuric acid followed by aqueous extraction. The process requires many neutralizations and filtrations.

The final products yielded for this process are thorium-phosphate concentrate, RE hydroxides, and uranium concentrate. Depending on the relative market prices of uranium, thorium, and rare earth elements as well as the availability of customers and the logistics of delivering to them, some or all of those products may be economical to sell or further process into a marketable form, while others constitute tailings for disposal. Products of the uranium and thorium decay series, particularly radium will be present in trace amounts and form a radiotoxic hazard. While radium-228 (a product of thorium decay) will be present only in extremely minute amounts (less than one milligram per metric ton of thorium), and will decay away with a half life of roughly 5.75 years, radium-226 will be present at a ratio above 300 milligrams per metric ton of uranium and due to its long half life (~1600 years) will essentially remain with the residue. As radium forms the least soluble alkaline earth metal sulfate known, radium sulfate will be present among the solid filtration products after sulfuric acid has been added.

== Containing nuclear waste ==
In two studies, one testing synthetic monazites radioactive waste storage capabilities by submerging it in a contaminated wastewater system for an extended period of time, and the other comparing the durability of the crystalline structures of multiple minerals, they investigate the ability of monazite to act as a host for nuclear byproducts from high-grade plutonium in decommissioned nuclear weapons and spent fuel from nuclear reactors. Results from both investigations show that monazite is one of the better options for storage in comparison to the previously used borosilicate glass.

One study done at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee the performance of synthetic monazite to borosilicate glass in radioactive waste management is compared. This experiment involved synthetic monazite and borosilicate glass being soaked in a contaminated simulated Savannah River defense wastes for 28 days, during the time period the leaching rates from both materials were measured. The results show that the synthetic monazite is a far more effective material for containing radioactive waste due to its low leaching rates and slow corrosion rate.

In a second study natural monazite is found to have an enhanced ability to deal with radiation byproducts due the property of radiation &quot;resistance&quot; as it is able to remain crystalline after being subjected to high amounts of alpha-decay radiation and becoming amorphized. Due to this high durability, it is seen as a better alternative for hosting materials such as radioactive strontium than other tested minerals. Synthetic monazite is also shown to have similar durability to that of the natural crystalline samples after it becomes fully amorphized.
