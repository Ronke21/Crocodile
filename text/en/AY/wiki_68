<text>ABC World News Tonight (titled ABC World News Tonight with David Muir for its weeknight broadcasts since September 2014) is the flagship daily evening television news program of ABC News, the news division of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) television network in the United States. It is currently the most watched network newscast in the United States, with an average of 2 million more than its nearest rival, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. Since 2014, the program&#x27;s weekday broadcasts have been anchored by David Muir. As of February 6–7, 2021, Whit Johnson and Linsey Davis anchor the Saturday and Sunday editions of the newscast respectively.

The program has been anchored at various times by a number of other presenters since its debut in 1948. It also has used various titles, including &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; from 1968 to 1978, &quot;World News Tonight&quot; from 1978 to 2006, &quot;World News&quot; from 2006 to 2009, and &quot;ABC World News&quot; from 2009 to 2014. Since 2014, the program has been called &quot;ABC World News Tonight.&quot; The weeknight edition of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; airs live at 6:30 p.m. in the Eastern and 5:30 p.m. in the Central Time Zones. However ABC affiliates KGNS, KNOE-2, WEEK-2, and WNCF air &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; half-an-hour later on delay. WSB also airs it on a delay, the only ABC station in the Eastern Time Zone to do so.

== History ==
ABC began a nightly newscast in the summer of 1948, when H. R. Baukhage and Jim Gibbons hosted &quot;News and Views&quot;. This was succeeded by &quot;After the Deadlines&quot; in 1951 and &quot;All Star News&quot; in 1952. In the fall of 1953, John Daly began anchoring the then-15-minute &quot;John Daly and the News&quot;. Daly, who served as host of the CBS game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; contemporaneously, anchored the newscast until 1960, with multiple hosts and formats succeeding him. Anchors of the program during the early 1960s, sometimes for short periods, included Alex Dreier, John Secondari, Fendall Winston Yerxa, Al Mann, Bill Shadel, and the three-person team of John Cameron Swayze (formerly of NBC), Bill Lawrence, and Bill Sheehan. In 1962, Ron Cochran was appointed as full-time anchor, staying with the program, entitled, “Ron Cochran with the News”, until 1965. After Cochran left the program, Peter Jennings, a Canadian journalist who was 26 years old at the time, was named anchor of the retitled &quot;Peter Jennings with the News&quot;.

In December 1967, the inexperienced Jennings left the anchor chair and was reassigned by the news division as an international correspondent for the news program. The newly renamed &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; was hosted, in succession, by Bob Young (January 1968 to May 1968), and then by Frank Reynolds (May 1968 to December 1970), who was joined by Howard K. Smith in May 1969. The program expanded from 15 to 30 minutes in January 1967, nearly years after both CBS and NBC had expanded their evening news programs to a half-hour.

=== Reasoner, Smith, and Walters ===
Harry Reasoner, formerly of CBS News and &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, joined ABC News in 1970 to co-anchor &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; with Smith, beginning that December, replacing Reynolds. The ratings increased steadily, but still remained in third place, behind dominant CBS and NBC. In 1975, Howard K. Smith was moved to a commentator role, and Reasoner briefly assumed sole-anchor responsibilities until he was paired with Barbara Walters, who became the first female network anchor when she joined the program on October 4, 1976. Ratings for the nightly news broadcast declined shortly thereafter, possibly due in part to the lack of chemistry between Reasoner and Walters. Reasoner would eventually return to CBS and &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, while Walters became a regular on the newsmagazine &quot;20/20&quot;.

=== &quot;First News&quot; strategy (1967–1982) ===

Even in areas with three full-time network affiliates, ABC stations often opted to broadcast the news program in the 6:00 p.m./5:00 p.m. timeslot to entice viewers by presenting the day&#x27;s national and international news first, thus making it more likely that they would stay tuned to the station&#x27;s local newscast immediately following the program (or one half-hour afterward), instead of turning to CBS or NBC.

Starting in 1973, before the advent of closed captioning, PBS began airing an open captioned version of the &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; that was distributed to various public television stations throughout the U.S., airing mostly in late-night timeslots five hours after the original ABC broadcast. This version was produced by WGBH, the Boston PBS station, which provided the captions and repackaged the broadcast with additional news stories – some of which were of special interest to the hearing impaired – as well as late-news developments, weather forecasts, and sports scores inserted in place of commercials. It was originally titled &quot;The Captioned ABC Evening News&quot;, and later as &quot;The Captioned ABC News&quot;, and it was originally distributed by the Eastern Educational Network, before becoming a national program under PBS a year later. The practice continued until 1982, when real-time closed captioning was first introduced in the United States by the National Captioning Institute.

=== &quot;World News Tonight&quot; (first era) ===

==== The early years (1978–1983) ====
Always the perennial third in the national ratings, ABC News president Roone Arledge reformatted the program, relaunching it as &quot;World News Tonight&quot; in July 1978. Reynolds, who was demoted when the network hired Reasoner, returned as lead anchor, reporting from ABC News&#x27; Washington, D.C. bureau. Max Robinson – who became the first African American network news anchor upon his appointment on the program – anchored national news from the news division&#x27;s Chicago bureau. Peter Jennings, who also returned for a second stint, reported international headlines from the division&#x27;s London bureau.

Occasional contributions included special reports by Walters, who was credited as anchor of the special coverage desk from New York City and worldwide, and commentary by Smith, who was easing into eventual retirement. The program&#x27;s distinct and easily identifiable theme (whose four-note musical signature was eventually used on other ABC News programs) was written by Bob Israel. Ratings slowly climbed to the point where &quot;World News Tonight&quot; eventually beat both &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, marking the first time ever that ABC had the most-watched network evening newscast.

==== Peter Jennings&#x27;s second solo tenure (1983–2005) ====
In April 1983, Reynolds became ill, and ABC News brought in &quot;This Week&quot; moderator David Brinkley to fill in for Reynolds. This arrangement continued until July 4; when ABC news summoned Peter Jennings to leave London and anchor from Washington, leaving both him and Robinson to co-anchor the broadcast until Reynolds&#x27; planned return. However, Reynolds died on July 20, 1983, from bone cancer. A rotation of anchors hosted the program until August 9, 1983, when ABC announced that Jennings became the sole anchor and senior editor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, which took effect September 5, and on that day, the program began broadcasting from New York City on a regular basis. Bill Owen would replace Bill Rice as announcer for a year.

In September 1984, the program was renamed &quot;World News Tonight with Peter Jennings&quot; to reflect its sole anchor and senior editor. Robinson left ABC News earlier in 1984, after stints of anchoring news briefs and the weekend editions of &quot;World News Tonight&quot;; he died from complications of AIDS in 1988. With Jennings as lead anchor, &quot;World News Tonight&quot; was the most-watched national newscast from February 27, 1989, to November 1, 1996, but from then on until February 2007, it placed second behind its main rival, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;.

In April 2005, Jennings announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and, as before, other ABC News anchors, including &quot;20/20&quot; co-anchor Elizabeth Vargas and &quot;Good Morning America&quot; co-anchor Charles Gibson, filled in for him. Jennings died of lung cancer on August 7, 2005, at his apartment in New York City, at age 67.

The August 8, 2005, edition of the program was dedicated in memory of Jennings and looked back at his four-decade career in news. His death ended the era of the so-called &quot;Big Three&quot; anchors: Jennings, NBC&#x27;s Tom Brokaw, and CBS&#x27;s Dan Rather (the latter two had retired from their positions as the respective anchors of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; within the year prior to Jennings&#x27;s death). During his career, Jennings had reported from every major world capital and war zone, and from all 50 U.S. states, according to the network. Jennings was known for his ability to calmly portray events as they were happening and for his coverage of many major world events such as the September 11 attacks and the dawn of the new millennium.

As a tribute to its recently deceased anchor, ABC continued to introduce the broadcast as &quot;World News Tonight with Peter Jennings&quot; in the week following his death. Gibson anchored the broadcast the first part of the week, playing a slow arrangement of the traditional theme music in memory of Jennings; Bob Woodruff anchored the final edition of &quot;World News Tonight with Peter Jennings&quot; on August 12, 2005. That night&#x27;s broadcast ended with one of Jennings&#x27;s favorite pieces of music instead of the traditional theme music. Beginning on August 15, 2005, the broadcast was introduced simply as &quot;World News Tonight&quot; and it remained that way until January 2006.

==== Bob Woodruff and Elizabeth Vargas (January–May 2006) ====
The program would return to a two-anchor format, when in early December 2005, ABC News announced that Elizabeth Vargas and Bob Woodruff would be the new permanent co-anchors of &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, replacing Jennings. People in the news industry looked at the choice of Vargas and Woodruff by ABC News as the start of a new era in network television news.

The broadcast was produced live three times per day – the regular live broadcast for the Eastern and Central Time Zones, plus separate broadcasts for the Mountain and Pacific Time Zones. In addition, a live webcast, &quot;World News Now&quot; (which, incidentally, carried the same title as ABC&#x27;s overnight news program), with a newsbrief and a preview of that evening&#x27;s broadcast, was launched. The webcast aired live at 3:00 pm. Eastern Time on ABC News Now and ABCNews.com, and could be viewed throughout the rest of the day after 4:00 pm. Eastern Time.

On January 29, 2006, Woodruff and his cameraman, Doug Vogt, were injured by a road-side bomb while riding in an Iraqi military convoy. Both underwent surgery at a U.S. military hospital in Balad, Iraq ( north of Baghdad). Both men incurred head injuries in the incident, even though they were both wearing body armor and helmets. Woodruff and Vogt were then evacuated to a U.S. military hospital in Germany, before later being transferred to Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland for further treatment and released for outpatient treatment. Within a few months after Woodruff&#x27;s accident, ABC News announced that Vargas was pregnant and due to give birth to her second child in late summer.

For about a month, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; co-hosts Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer had alternated co-anchoring the newscast with Vargas. During the spring of 2006, Vargas mostly anchored the broadcast alone, becoming the first &quot;de facto&quot; solo female evening news anchor. At the time, it was unknown what ABC News planned to do until Woodruff returned to the anchor chair, which appeared not to be within the near future, and when Vargas began her maternity leave. Rumors flew that Sawyer wanted to become the sole anchor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; to beat Katie Couric&#x27;s switch to the anchor chair at the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. However, &quot;New York Post&quot; columnist Cindy Adams reported that Gibson would become Woodruff&#x27;s &quot;temporary permanent replacement&quot;. Also starting in early 2006, the West Coast editions of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; were scaled back because Vargas anchored the broadcast on her own at the time.

=== &quot;World News&quot; ===

==== Charles Gibson (2006–2009) ====

In May 2006, Vargas announced her resignation from &quot;World News Tonight&quot;. Charles Gibson was then named sole anchor of the program, effectively replacing Vargas and her injured co-anchor Woodruff. Vargas cited her doctors&#x27; recommendation to cut back her schedule considerably because of her maternity leave, and her wish to spend more time with her new baby. She has since returned to co-anchor &quot;20/20&quot; and ABC News specials, and has served as a substitute anchor on &quot;World News Tonight&quot; under Gibson and his successors.

Woodruff, although still recovering from his injuries, returned to &quot;World News Tonight&quot; as a correspondent on February 28, 2007.

Some media analysts found the reasons for the appointment of Gibson as anchor to be merely a cover for ABC News&#x27;s real intentions to bring stability to its flagship news program, which had seen its ratings slip, and to attract some older viewers away from the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; with interim anchor Bob Schieffer. Indeed, the advertising campaign focused on Gibson&#x27;s experience, calling him &quot;Your Trusted Source&quot;, similar to a campaign for Jennings, &quot;Trust Is Earned&quot;, in the wake of the Killian documents controversy at CBS and Brian Williams&#x27;s assumption of the NBC anchor chair.

On July 19, 2006, ABC News announced that &quot;World News Tonight&quot; would have its name officially changed to &quot;World News with Charles Gibson&quot;. The network chose to make the, albeit minor, change to remove &quot;Tonight&quot; from the title to reflect the program&#x27;s expansion into the &quot;24-hour space created by the digital world&quot;.

In the February 2007 sweeps, &quot;World News with Charles Gibson&quot; achieved the number-one spot in the Nielsen ratings among the network evening news broadcasts, overtaking &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, marking ABC News&#x27; first victory since the week Jennings died in August 2005.

&quot;World News with Charles Gibson&quot; won the May 2007 sweeps period decisively over &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, marking Gibson&#x27;s second consecutive sweeps win and widening the program&#x27;s lead in the evening news race. It was the first time that &quot;World News&quot; had won consecutive sweeps periods since 1996, the year ABC News ceded the ratings crown to &quot;NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw&quot;. &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; retook first place in the November 2007 sweeps and the two programs remained in a tight race until the fall of 2008, when the NBC program established a consistent lead.

On August 25, 2008, &quot;World News&quot; became the fourth and final network evening newscast to begin broadcasting in HD.

On September 2, 2009, ABC News announced that Gibson would retire from ABC News altogether on December 18, 2009, and that Sawyer would assume the anchor desk on December 21, 2009. Gibson&#x27;s final broadcast ended with a video tribute that included all of the living former U.S. Presidents, former ABC anchors, actors and actresses, singers, comedians, Mickey Mouse, Kermit the Frog, athletes, the commander of the International Space Station, competitors Couric and Williams, and was capped off by U.S. President Barack Obama.

==== Diane Sawyer (2009–2014) ====
Long-time ABC journalist and anchorwoman Diane Sawyer (who previously co-anchored &quot;Good Morning America&quot; with predecessor Gibson) began anchoring the broadcast, which amended its title to &quot;ABC World News&quot;, on December 21, 2009. On that date, the program debuted an updated set, new graphics during the introductory segment, along with a new announcer, Mike Rowe (then host of Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot;), who replaced longtime announcer Bill Rice. A new set for the program debuted on August 23, 2010. Substitute anchors for the program during Sawyer&#x27;s tenure when she was away or on assignment, in addition to Vargas, included David Muir (who by that point, anchored the weekend editions of &quot;World News&quot; and served as a weekday correspondent), George Stephanopoulos, Cynthia McFadden, Dan Harris, Paula Faris and Byron Pitts (with the exception of McFadden, who left ABC News in August 2014, most of these anchors/correspondents have also served as substitutes following Muir&#x27;s appointment as anchor of the program).

The Sawyer tenure was marked by a shift towards more &quot;news you can use&quot; features, and less of a focus on hard international news. &quot;World News&quot; at the time had a 60% female viewership, the highest of the three major network evening newscasts.

On October 1, 2012, &quot;World News&quot; debuted a new logo, opening theme (which was composed by Hans Zimmer, replacing the longtime Bob Israel-composed theme), an updated set and new graphics package. The program also introduced a segment called the &quot;Instant Index&quot;, a feature appearing as the penultimate segment of each night&#x27;s broadcast focusing on news stories that are trending on social media, pop culture and entertainment-related stories and viral videos. Another feature introduced during Sawyer&#x27;s tenure was &quot;Made in America&quot;, a feature segment reported by David Muir, chronicling enterprising American companies.

On June 25, 2014, ABC News announced that Sawyer would step down as the weekday anchor of &quot;ABC World News&quot;; Sawyer would be succeeded by the program&#x27;s then weekend anchor, David Muir, effective September 2. On July 28, 2014, the program debuted a slightly updated set, which includes a new, larger monitor behind the anchor desk. Diane Sawyer ultimately decided to end her tenure as anchor of &quot;ABC World News&quot; nearly a week before Muir began as anchor of the weeknight editions on August 27, 2014, to spend time with family. By the time Sawyer left &quot;World News&quot;, the program was the No. 1 network evening newscast in all major key demographics and significantly closed the ratings gap with &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; in total viewership.

=== &quot;World News Tonight&quot; (second era) ===

==== David Muir (2014–present) ====

David Muir became the weekday anchor and managing editor of the program on September 1, 2014, while retaining his duties as co-anchor of &quot;20/20&quot;. At the same time, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; co-host George Stephanopoulos assumed the news division&#x27;s Chief Anchor position that had traditionally been assigned to the anchor of &quot;World News&quot;. Following the departure of Diane Sawyer, the title of the program was also silently rebranded back to &quot;World News Tonight&quot; for the first time since 2006, albeit with &quot;ABC&quot; attached to the title. Primary substitutes are Stephanopoulos, Rebecca Jarvis, and Amy Robach.

&quot;World News Tonight&quot; has broadcast from San Bernardino, Orlando, Paris, and Brussels after terrorist attacks, and from Dallas after five policemen were shot dead in July 2016. In November 2016, &quot;World News Tonight&quot; was the most-watched network primetime newscast for the first time in 18 years. The last time &quot;World News&quot; held the top spot was during the 1998–99 season when Peter Jennings sat at the anchor&#x27;s desk, according to Nielsen.

&quot;World News Tonight&quot; was the most-watched network evening newscast for the week of March 30, 2015. This marked the first time in seven years that the program finished at No. 1, beating out &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; in all categories.
On August 10, 2020, &quot; World News Tonight&quot; marked 11 consecutive weeks as &quot;America&#x27;s Most-Watched Show&quot;.

On September 8, 2020, &quot;World News Tonight&quot; debuted a new title card, reintroduced the long-time Bob Israel-composed opening theme (replacing the Hans Zimmer theme), and revealed an updated set and new graphics package.

On October 26, 2023, &quot;World News Tonight&quot; began posting full broadcasts to ABC News&#x27; YouTube channel.

== Weekend newscasts ==
ABC first attempted an early evening weekend newscast in July 1975, when it debuted a Saturday bulletin that was anchored by Ted Koppel and taken over by Tom Jarriel and Sylvia Chase in 1977. The broadcast, however, was not carried by many stations, and was cancelled in January 1979.

Following the Saturday news cancellation, and after the flagship weeknight broadcast became &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, the program premiered &quot;World News Sunday&quot; on January 28, 1979, and expanded to a full seven days with the restoration of a Saturday newscast (&quot;World News Saturday&quot;) on January 5, 1985, years after NBC and CBS had each launched their own weekend evening news programs. These editions added the word &quot;Tonight&quot; to the program title in the mid-1990s, further unifying it with the weekday editions, and in the mid-2000s, their respective names were shortened uniformly to &quot;World News Tonight&quot; to correspond with those broadcasts. However, the original names were restored on July 19, 2006, concurrent with the retitling of the weekday broadcasts, but the opening title sequence displayed the name as &quot;World News&quot; for both the Saturday and Sunday editions.

Prior to 1975, the only network newscasts that ABC stations broadcast on weekends were 15-minute late-night updates on Saturdays and Sundays, known as &quot;ABC Weekend News&quot; and later, &quot;ABC News Weekend Report&quot;. The programs were fed to affiliates at 11:00pm Eastern/10:00pm Central and were seen in tandem with the stations&#x27; own late newscasts, although some stations opted to tape-delay the network updates until immediately before their regular sign-off time (rival CBS also offered a 15-minute Sunday night bulletin during the 1970s until 1997). Because of declining affiliate interest (in part because of the proliferation of 24-hour cable news channels such as CNN) and low viewership, ABC discontinued the late-night weekend reports in September 1991.

In addition, starting in 1973, weeknight co-anchor Harry Reasoner hosted &quot;The Reasoner Report&quot;, a half-hour topical analysis of important stories (especially breaking developments in the Watergate scandal) in the vein of CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, which Reasoner himself co-moderated at two different times. Affiliates usually carried the program on Saturday evenings in the time slots where the main newscast aired on weeknights. The program, which had affiliate clearance problems and was thus unsuccessful in terms of ratings, ended in 1975, replaced by the network&#x27;s inaugural Saturday newscast (see above).

Some former anchors of the weekend news broadcasts include Sam Donaldson (Sunday edition, 1979–1989), Kathleen Sullivan (Saturday edition, 1985–1987), Barry Serafin (Saturday edition, 1987–1988), Forrest Sawyer (Sunday edition, 1989–1993), Carole Simpson (Saturday edition, 1988–1993; Sunday edition, 1993–2003), Elizabeth Vargas (Saturday edition, 1997–2003; Sunday edition, 2003–2004), Jim Avila (Saturday edition, 2006–2007), Terry Moran (Saturday edition, 2004–2005), Bob Woodruff (Sunday edition, 2004–2005), Dan Harris (Sunday edition, 2006–2011) and David Muir (Saturday edition, 2007–2011; Saturday and Sunday editions, 2011–2014). Muir, who had taken over &quot;World News Saturday&quot; in 2007, took over the Sunday broadcast in 2011, ending the practice of using separate anchors for the Saturday and Sunday editions of the program, with ABC renaming both broadcasts as &quot;ABC World News with David Muir&quot; as a result. David Muir anchored the weekend program until he took over the weekday broadcast in September 2014. The program returned to using separate anchors for the weekend broadcasts afterward, with Cecilia Vega being named anchor of the Saturday broadcast and Tom Llamas named anchor of the Sunday edition in February 2015. After Vega was named senior White House correspondent, Llamas was named sole weekend anchor in January 2017, as the practice of using separate anchors for the Saturday and Sunday editions ended once again. Llamas subsequently left in January 2021, to join NBC News. In February 2021, Whit Johnson and Linsey Davis were announced as anchors of the weekend edition, with Johnson anchoring on Saturday and Davis anchoring on Sunday.

Some ABC affiliates air the Saturday and Sunday editions of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; at 6:00p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time (5:00p.m. Central and Mountain)one half-hour earlier than the weekday broadcasts. The weekend editions of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; may periodically be abbreviated or preempted outright due to sports telecasts that overrun into its or occasionally air immediately following the program (the latter preemption situation commonly affects stations in the Pacific and Mountain Time Zones); this is particularly common during fall, as the Saturday broadcast does not air at all from September through mid December due to ABC&#x27;s college football coverage and during the winter and spring, when the Sunday broadcast is sometimes delayed or preempted due to overruns of the network&#x27;s NBA telecasts.

== International newscasts ==
ABC News programs, including &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;, are shown for several hours a day on the 24-hour news network OSN News in MENA Region.

Various cable companies in the Caribbean simulcast &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; from Miami-based WPLG. Similarly, cable companies in Canada simulcast the program with most airing from either Seattle-based KOMO, Boston-based WCVB, or Detroit-based WXYZ which operate as timeshift channels.

In the United Kingdom, the program was shown Tuesday through Fridays at 1:30 a.m. on BBC News, a channel that is frequently simulcast by BBC One at this time, meaning the program was broadcast on analogue terrestrial television in many parts of that country until the digital transition. The newscast was aired on a delay, in part because of the need to remove commercial advertisements, as the BBC&#x27;s domestic channels operate as commercial-free services via a television license fee, replacing them with promotions for different BBC News special programs. The program was replaced by &quot;Asia Business Report&quot; and &quot;Sport Today&quot; on June 14, 2011, but later returned to the channel on August 20, 2012. It was also available on the BBC&#x27;s on-demand service BBC iPlayer for 28 days after its domestic broadcast. The program was replaced again by Asia Business Report and Sport Today on March 30, 2015.

In Australia, &quot;WNT&quot; was aired every morning at 10:30 am. AET on Sky News Australia until it was moved to SBS and SBS Viceland in July 2019. &quot;WNT&quot; previously broadcast on New Zealand-based TVNZ Duke.

In Hong Kong, the program was broadcast live on TVB Pearl daily at 07:30 until 08:00 HKT until May 31, 2009, when it was replaced by &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;.

In Japan, it airs on NHK BS 1 as part of the weekday morning program &quot;Catch! Sekai no Top News (Catch the Global Top News)&quot; and later on &quot;World News&quot;, and in clip form during the English language educational program &quot;Kōryaku! ABC News Eigo (Strategies! ABC News English)&quot; until its end in March 2021.

In Belize, Great Belize Television carries all editions of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; each weekday at 8:00 p.m. and weekends at 7:00 p.m.

== Radio broadcast ==
Fargo-based radio station WDAY-AM simulcasts the weekday version of the program from local ABC affiliate WDAY/KBMY/WDAZ/KMCY.

<text>NBC Nightly News (titled as NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt for its weeknight broadcasts since June 22, 2015) is the flagship daily evening television news program for NBC News, the news division of the NBC television network in the United States. First aired on August 3, 1970, the program is currently the second most watched network newscast in the United States, behind ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot;. &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; is produced from Studio 1A at NBC Studios at 30 Rockefeller Center in New York City. Selected Los Angeles–based editions broadcast from The Brokaw News Center in Universal City, California, or when broadcasting from Washington, D.C., either from the NBC News bureau based at WRC-TV in the Tenleytown neighborhood, or NBC&#x27;s secondary studio overlooking Capitol Hill.

Since 2015, the broadcast has been anchored by Lester Holt on weeknights, José Díaz-Balart on Saturday and Hallie Jackson since 2024 on Sunday. Previous anchors have included John Chancellor, David Brinkley, Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams.

The program is broadcast live over most NBC stations from 6:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time seven days a week; the &quot;Western Edition&quot; of the program occasionally features breaking news and/or updated information on news stories covered during the original telecast for Pacific Time Zone viewers, and some stations in that time zone carry it live at 3:30 p.m. PT to lead into their late afternoon local news blocks. Its current theme music, &quot;The Mission&quot;, debuted in 1985 and was composed by John Williams.

==History==

===John Chancellor and David Brinkley (1970–1982)===
&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; replaced &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot; on August 3, 1970 upon Chet Huntley&#x27;s retirement. At first, David Brinkley, John Chancellor, and Frank McGee rotated duties as anchors. At least one, usually two, and very rarely all three anchored the program on a given night. Except for the few nights when one of the men solo anchored, each evening&#x27;s program included one anchor based in New York City and one in Washington, D.C., as had been the case on the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;. Brinkley&#x27;s appearances were always from Washington and McGee&#x27;s were always from New York. Chancellor moved between those two cities depending on his partner for the evening.

In addition to Brinkley as a holdover from the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;, McGee had earned praise for his anchoring or co-anchoring of space flights, and Chancellor had also earned praise as McGee&#x27;s co-anchor for the space missions of Apollo 12 and Apollo 13.
With network executives perceiving the instability of this arrangement as a factor in &quot;Nightly News&quot; losing audience share to the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, NBC discontinued the rotation arrangement, and McGee eventually took over for Hugh Downs as host of &quot;Today&quot;. Chancellor became the sole anchor of the program on August 9, 1971, with Brinkley providing a three-minute commentary segment, &quot;David Brinkley&#x27;s Journal,&quot; from Washington several times a week.

On June 7, 1976, NBC brought Brinkley back to the anchor desk and tried the dual-anchor approach once again. Initially, Chancellor and Brinkley both reported from New York City, however Brinkley would later return to Washington. Chancellor again became sole anchor of &quot;Nightly News&quot; on October 10, 1979, with Brinkley once again providing commentaries until he left NBC for ABC News in 1981, where he became host of that network&#x27;s new Sunday morning interview show &quot;This Week&quot;.

Despite the various changes, Chancellor was never able to break the grip that Walter Cronkite and the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; had on the American news viewer, although &quot;Nightly News&quot; was sometimes a strong second place in the evening news ratings for most of the 1970s. After stepping down from the anchor desk on April 2, 1982, Chancellor remained on the program as an editorial commentator until his retirement in 1993.

===Tom Brokaw (1982–2004)===
On April 5, 1982, Tom Brokaw, who had been serving as anchor of &quot;Today&quot; since 1976, joined the program and took over co-anchor duties in New York City, while Roger Mudd became anchor in Washington. Mudd was dropped from the broadcast and Brokaw became the solo anchor of &quot;Nightly News&quot; on September 5, 1983, the same day that his ABC competitor, Peter Jennings, became sole anchor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot;. With Brokaw being the sole anchor, the &quot;Nightly News&quot; was now completely based in New York City. Among other news items, he covered the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, EDSA Revolution, Loma Prieta earthquake, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Hurricane Andrew. As anchor, Brokaw conducted the first one-on-one American television interviews with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He was the only network anchor in Berlin when the Berlin Wall fell. Brokaw&#x27;s presence slowly attracted viewers, and during the 1990s, &quot;Nightly News&quot; battled for the viewership lead with &quot;World News Tonight&quot;. He and Katie Couric hosted a prime-time newsmagazine, &quot;Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric&quot;, that aired from 1993 to 1994 before being folded into the multi-night &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; program. By 1997, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; had solidified its first place standing in the ratings, a spot it would retain solely for ten years. The once-dominant &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, anchored by Dan Rather, had lost a substantial portion of the audience it held during the Walter Cronkite era and slid to third place (where it still remains as of 2017) in the viewership wars.
On September 11, 2001, Brokaw joined Katie Couric and Matt Lauer around 9:30 a.m., following the live attack on the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and continued to anchor all day, until after midnight. Following the collapse of the second tower, Brokaw said:

On May 28, 2002, Brokaw announced his retirement as anchor of &quot;Nightly News&quot;, to take effect shortly after the Presidential election in 2004. During this last time helming the network&#x27;s presidential election coverage, NBC graphic designers created images of a giant electoral map on the ice rink at Rockefeller Plaza, and cherry pickers tallied the electoral vote count on the façade of 30 Rockefeller Plaza (this tradition has continued with each election since then). Brokaw&#x27;s final broadcast took place on December 1, 2004, ending 22 years on the &quot;Nightly News&quot; desk and a 21-year run as the network&#x27;s chief newsman – a record tenure in NBC&#x27;s history.

===Brian Williams (2004–2015)===
Brian Williams, a frequent substitute for Brokaw for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, succeeded him as the program&#x27;s permanent anchor on December 2, 2004. The program held onto the #1 ratings spot among the network evening newscasts from Williams&#x27; first day, averaging about 10 million viewers each week until February 2007, when it slipped behind its closest competitor &quot;World News with Charles Gibson&quot;. However, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; regained the lead a few months later; it has now been America&#x27;s most-watched evening newscast for over a decade.

Williams rose to new levels of popularity for his live spot reporting during and after the 2005 hurricane season. With the transition to Williams, the show recognized its past in its opening seconds, with small photos of past anchors and sets and the voices of John Cameron Swayze, Huntley, Brinkley, Chancellor, and Brokaw, as well as an orchestral version of the &quot;G-E-C&quot; NBC Chimes serving as an intro bumper, before going into the opening headlines summary read by Williams; this montage was discontinued on September 17, 2007 except for weekends and nights with substitute anchors until October 2007. On December 4, 2006, &quot;Nightly News&quot; was presented with &quot;limited commercial interruptions&quot; through a sponsorship arrangement with Philips, marking the first time in its 36-year history that the newscast experimented with reduced advertising.

During Williams&#x27; tenure as main anchor of the program, Lester Holt and Kate Snow often substituted while he was on vacation or on assignment; other substitute anchors included Katie Couric, Matt Lauer, Savannah Guthrie, Tamron Hall, Harry Smith, Jenna Wolfe, Erica Hill, Hoda Kotb, Natalie Morales and Carl Quintanilla, as well as now-former NBC anchors Ann Curry, Campbell Brown, David Gregory, Amy Robach, Peter Alexander, and John Seigenthaler.

&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; began broadcasting in high definition on March 26, 2007, becoming the first of the three network evening news programs to make the transition (the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; began broadcasting in HD on January 7, 2008; &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; began broadcasting in HD on August 25, 2008, during its coverage of the 2008 Democratic National Convention). Most news video from on-remote locations continued to be shot in standard definition at the time, while the network&#x27;s news bureaus underwent a conversion to HD, which was completed in 2009.

The &quot;Nightly News&quot; set in Studio 3C, which had been in use since January 27, 1992, was retired on May 4, 2007. The broadcast temporarily relocated to Studio 8G on the same set as of May 8, 2007, used for the studio segments seen during the network&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; broadcasts and its pregame show, and where NBC&#x27;s 2006 Congressional election coverage originated. After months of construction, Studio 3C was re-opened on October 22, 2007, with the introduction of a new set for &quot;Nightly News&quot;; sister cable network MSNBC&#x27;s new set in Studio 3A was also inaugurated at that time. On October 24, 2011, the broadcast moved to Studio 3B, which also served as the homebase of Williams&#x27; short-lived newsmagazine for NBC, &quot;Rock Center&quot;.

====Embellishment scandal/suspension and replacement====
On February 4, 2015, Williams apologized on the program for having “conflated” on numerous occasions an account that he had been aboard a Chinook helicopter shot down by enemy fire from a rocket-propelled grenade while covering the Invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he was in fact aboard a helicopter that followed behind it. This came after he received criticism by U.S. soldiers for embellishing the story when a segment from the January 30, 2015, broadcast recounting the incident was posted on the program&#x27;s Facebook page. The revelation spurred negative press towards Williams, including some asking for him to be fired by NBC News, although Paul Rieckhoff, founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, stated that “persecuting [Williams] over this mistake will do little to help our veterans and service members”.

Amid that controversy and questions over Williams&#x27; claims that made regarding his experiences while reporting from New Orleans on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, including that he contracted dysentery from accidentally ingesting flood water, the news division decided to launch an internal investigation into the matter that would be conducted through its investigative unit. On February 7, 2015, Williams stated in a memo to NBC News staff that he would take himself &quot;off the daily broadcast for the next several days,&quot; with Lester Holt substituting for him on the weeknight broadcasts.

On February 10, 2015, Williams was suspended without pay for six months due to the scandal which arose after he came under fire for fabricating a story about his reporting on the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. Williams claimed to have been reporting in Iraq in 2002 when the helicopter he was traveling on was hit by an RPG and he was forced to land. He had told the story several times, including his appearances on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and on &quot;Nightly News&quot; itself only a few nights before several war veterans who had been with Williams in 2002 claimed that Williams had not been present at the time of the crash, but showed up about an hour later to report on it. Williams issued an apology, saying he had &quot;misremembered&quot; the story in his head and it had been a genuine accident, but many critics accused Williams of fabricating the story and called for his resignation. Williams later announced that he would be taking some time off because he had become &quot;too much a part of the news.&quot; NBC announced that weekend anchor Lester Holt would anchor the program in the interim.

===Lester Holt (2015–present)===


On June 18, 2015, NBC News and MSNBC chairman Andrew Lack announced that Lester Holt would become the main anchor of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; on a permanent basis effective on June 22, 2015, Holt was on a scheduled vacation on the day of the announcement, with &quot;Today&quot; presenter Savannah Guthrie serving as interim anchor of the broadcast that week. After his suspension ended in August, Brian Williams was reassigned to MSNBC where he previously served as both an anchor and correspondent.

Holt previously served as interim anchor of the weeknight broadcasts from August 6, 2013 to September 2, 2013, when Williams went on medical leave from NBC News in order to undergo knee replacement surgery. With his promotion to main anchor, Holt is the first African-American solo weeknight anchor of a major network newscast. Max Robinson was co-anchor of ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot; from 1978 to 1983, and Gwen Ifill was a co-anchor of the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; from 2013 to 2016.

On June 27, 2016, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; switched to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation, with the existing graphics package being re-positioned for the 16:9 format. On October 10, 2016, the newscast debuted an entirely new on-air look with graphics originally optimized for the full 16:9 presentation, including a new program logo replacing variations of the previous one that had been used since November 8, 1999.

On July 14, 2017, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; permanently moved back from Studio 3B to Studio 3C.

In 2018, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; launched an ongoing series of specials, &quot;NBC Nightly Films&quot;.

On August 11, 2021, it was announced that executive producer Jennifer Suozzo would be departing the program and Meghan Rafferty would be interim executive producer on August 16, 2021.

On September 13, 2021, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; permanently moved from Studio 3C to Studio 1A, also the home of &quot;Today&quot;.

On June 19, 2023, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; underwent its first large-scale rebrand since the Brian Williams era as part of a wider rebranding of NBC as a whole; it was unveiled by NBC during an event honoring of 75 years of televised newscasts on NBC. The rebrand includes a new on-air graphics scheme intended to create fewer distractions from the content of stories, as well as a new stylized “N” emblem (reminiscent of the network&#x27;s 1979–86 &quot;Proud N&quot; logo) that can be split apart to display headlines, and is better-suited for digital platforms.

On February 24, 2025, NBC News announced Holt would be stepping down from &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; in the summer to focus more on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;. While NBC has not officially named a replacement for Holt, it is rumored that Tom Llamas and Weekend anchors José Díaz-Balart and Hallie Jackson might rotate as anchors on an interim basis until a permanent replacement is named.

==Weekend editions==
NBC first offered a Saturday evening newscast in 1961, with Sander Vanocur anchoring the &quot;NBC Saturday Night Report&quot;. Four years later, NBC correspondents Ray Scherer and Robert MacNeil were partnered at the anchor desk on &quot;The Scherer-MacNeil Report&quot; on Saturdays, continuing until 1967. At that time, the network replaced it with a second weekend airing of &quot;The Frank McGee Report&quot;, which had been airing on Sundays for several years by that point. The Saturday edition of the &quot;Report&quot; ran for about a year and a half.

On January 4, 1969, the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; was expanded to Saturday evenings, with the main anchors working solo on alternating weeks. When lower-than-expected ratings occurred, the network pulled the pair off Saturdays and assigned others such as McGee and Vanocur to anchor the broadcast. On August 2, 1970, two days after the weekday &quot;Huntley-Brinkley&quot; broadcast ended, the network expanded its evening newscast to Sundays, which also replaced the Sunday broadcast of &quot;The Frank McGee Report&quot;. For the first year after the Sunday broadcast began, Chancellor, Brinkley and McGee rotated on the program as they did on weeknights; there were no separate weekend anchors. The Saturday and Sunday broadcasts were respectively titled &quot;NBC Saturday Night News&quot; and &quot;NBC Sunday Night News&quot; until sometime in the 1970s, when they adopted the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; name.

When Chancellor became sole anchor of the weeknight editions in August 1971, separate anchors were named for the weekend editions.

The weekend editions may occasionally be abbreviated or preempted due to NBC Sports telecasts that overrun into the program&#x27;s time slot. During the NFL season, the Sunday editions air live in every time zone at 6:30 p.m. Eastern time, immediately prior to &quot;Football Night in America&quot; and &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;.

==Kids edition==

In April 2020, NBC News began producing a version of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; targeted at children ages 6 to 16, featuring stories aimed at children. This edition is hosted by Lester Holt and new episodes premiere every Thursday on NBC News&#x27; YouTube channel. Beginning on October 31, 2020, occasional editions of &quot;NBC Nightly News: Kids Edition&quot; have aired on Saturdays on NBC.

==Announcer==
Bill Hanrahan handled the announcing duties for the newscast until his retirement in 1983, as he had done for the predecessor &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;. The next announcer for the program was long-time NBC staff announcer Howard Reig. He retired to Florida in 2005, but a recording he had made before his retirement was used on the program until December 14, 2007. When the show was broadcast on remote or a new substitute anchor was used, Reig recorded a new introduction in a Miami studio. Since Holt took over as anchor, the weekend editions have been voiced by Bill Wolff, who had also worked occasionally on special weekday editions when Reig was unavailable. On December 17, 2007, the weeknight broadcast introduced an opening by Academy Award winning actor/producer Michael Douglas until it was discontinued on June 18, 2015, and was replaced by Wolff.

==Theme music/Intros==

* &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report/NBC Nightly News Ticker&quot; (August 3, 1970 – November 10, 1972; the theme had been used since 1962, when the program was still &quot;The Huntley–Brinkley Report&quot;)
* &quot;NBC News Ticker&quot; (November 13, 1972 – April 22, 1977)
* &quot;NBC TV-Radio Newspulse&quot; by Fred Weinberg Productions (April 25, 1977 – September 5, 1977)
* &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; by Henry Mancini (September 6, 1977 – June 29, 1979)
* &quot;NBC News&quot; by Joseph Paul Sicurella, Tony Smythe, and Bob Christianson (1979–1985)
** Original version (July 2, 1979 – April 2, 1982)
** Electronic version (April 5, 1982 – September 6, 1985)
* &quot;The Mission&quot; by John Williams (September 9, 1985 – present)

&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and all NBC News programs had an animation of the Statue of Liberty for their opening sequences from September 1985 to April 1988.

From late 2007 through 2012, the intro commenced with a timeline showing the different NBC News anchors and logos whilst the show&#x27;s theme song plays followed by showing the NBC News&#x27; filming station in New York (It does not appear when telecasts are filmed in other areas like Washington).

From 2012 through 2016, the intro was different pictures of the earth which formed into the NBC News&#x27; filming station in New York.

==Notable incidents==
In September 2001, a letter containing anthrax was addressed to then &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchor Tom Brokaw as part of the 2001 anthrax attacks. Brokaw was not harmed, but two NBC News employees were infected.

On April 18, 2007, NBC News received a package containing a &quot;multimedia manifesto&quot; from Seung-Hui Cho, the gunman responsible for the Virginia Tech shooting that occurred two days earlier, the deadliest school shooting in American history. Upon the package&#x27;s discovery, NBC News handed the package over to federal authorities. The specific details of the package contained a DVD disc of Cho reading from a typed manifesto (also in the package), as well as more than 40 pictures of Cho brandishing weapons, including the two handguns believed to have been used in the massacre. Some of the package&#x27;s contents were shown, albeit copied from the originals and edited for profanity, on the April 18, 2007, edition of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, with anchor Brian Williams and NBC chief justice correspondent Pete Williams (no relation to Brian) examining the package&#x27;s contents in the opening moments of the broadcast.

On November 29, 2011, a fire alarm went off in the studio a few seconds into the &quot;Nightly News&quot; Eastern Time Zone broadcast. Despite the false alarm, Brian Williams continued to anchor throughout the entire broadcast. Once the alarm had been turned off, Williams redid the broadcast for the Mountain and Pacific Time Zones, and other selected stations. NBC News apologized for the incident on the program&#x27;s Twitter account:
==International broadcast==

===Ongoing===

====Canada====

NBC&#x27;s Seattle, Spokane, Detroit, Buffalo, Minneapolis, Boston, Plattsburgh and Bangor affiliates are separately available through most Canadian cable companies. Because of their markets&#x27; proximity to the Canadian border, NBC affiliates WDIV, WGRZ, and WPBN (through WGTQ&#x27;s HD2 channel) air live broadcasts of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; without cable.

====Caribbean====
The Antillean, Cayman, and some of the Leeward islands air live episodes of NBC Nightly News through Miami-based NBC affiliate WTVJ, which is carried by cable provider FLOW TV as part of their lineup.

====Europe/MENA====
&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; is broadcast live on CNBC Europe at 12:30 AM CET (11:30 PM GMT and 10:30 PM during DST respectively), although the Sunday edition of the programme is not shown due to the channel broadcasting live business programming on Sundays at that time of day. It also airs on the 24-hour news network OSN News in MENA Region, with the weekday editions airing immediately after their original telecast in the U.S. and the weekend edition being simulcast live.

In Great Britain in 2022 and 2023, NBC News Now was available on Sky and Virgin Media as a linear channel, resulting in &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;&#x27;s broadcasts on the channel being seen in the UK, both as a live broadcast and as a replay.

====Hong Kong====
In Hong Kong, the program is broadcast live (or delayed) on TVB Pearl daily at 7:30 AM Hong Kong Time (corresponding to 18:30, or 6:30 PM, in the Eastern Time Zone of the U.S.).

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; returned on Philippine cable and satellite TV starting January 1, 2021, broadcast live daily at 7:30 AM (or 6:30 AM during daylight saving time in the US) on TAP Edge. Starting October 26, 2021, broadcasts of the program were moved to sister channel TAP TV (However, the program will be pre-empted on the other days to give way for the live coverage of ISU Figure Skating Championships events).

==== US Armed Forces ====
&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; is broadcast on AFN|news, a channel that is available to several American military bases and ships around the world through the American Forces Network.

===Discontinued===

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; was aired Mondays through Fridays at 8:30 AM (after &quot;Daybreak&quot;), Saturdays at 9:00 AM and Sundays at 10:00 AM local time; it is also rebroadcast at 5:30 PM each weeknight, 1:30 PM on Saturdays, 4:30 AM on Tuesdays to Saturdays, 10:00 PM on Sundays and daily at 1:30 AM local time on 9TV (formerly as Talk TV and Solar News Channel). The newscast was discontinued in February 2015 as a part of transitory preparations as 9TV eventually re-branded to CNN Philippines on March 16, 2015.

====Bermuda====
The East Coast feed of the program was broadcast in Bermuda on local NBC affiliate VSB-TV in the British Overseas Territory; the station ceased broadcasting on August 31, 2014. Access to the programme in the Bahamas remains through cable feeds of WNBC/New York or WTVJ/Miami.

==Video-on-demand==
&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; is also available worldwide as an audio podcast, and can be streamed on demand from the NBC News website the night of its original broadcast after 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Beginning with the March 27, 2018, broadcast, &quot;Nightly News&quot; broadcasts have also started appearing on NBC News&#x27;s YouTube channel. On January 25, 2015, NBC began indicating that the video podcast of the program would be discontinued and refers users to the news division&#x27;s website or mobile apps to view editions of &quot;Nightly News&quot; on mobile devices, although such apps are not compatible with devices that feature podcast support such as early generation Apple TV or Roku devices (current-gen devices offer access to an NBC News app with newscast replays). The video podcast was discontinued on February 14, 2015.

<doc id="194739" wikidata="Q20119933" url="?curid=194739" title="Cozumel">
<text>Cozumel (; ) is an island and municipality in the Caribbean Sea off the eastern coast of Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán Peninsula, opposite Playa del Carmen. It is separated from the mainland by the Cozumel Channel and is close to the Yucatán Channel. The municipality is part of the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Cozumel&quot; was derived from the Mayan &quot;Cuzamil&quot; (also spelled &quot;Cutzmil&quot;) or &quot;Ah Cuzamil Peten&quot; in full, which means &quot;the island of swallows&quot; ().

==Geography==
The island is located in the Caribbean Sea along the eastern side of the Yucatan Peninsula about south of Cancún and from the mainland. The island is about long and wide, with a total area of . It is Mexico&#x27;s largest Caribbean island, largest permanently inhabited island, and Mexico&#x27;s third-largest island, following Tiburón Island and Isla Ángel de la Guarda. The population of Cozumel is 88,626 (2020 census). The majority of the island&#x27;s population lives in the town of San Miguel, which has a population of 84,915 (2020 census). Cozumel is a municipality which also includes two small areas on the mainland, the ecotourism park of Xel-Ha and the Calica limestone quarry. All combined, Cozumel has a total land area of . Cozumel has 5 main piers. Punta Langosta, the International Pier (SSA), and Puerta Maya are all piers for cruise ships. A ferry pier in San Miguel is used for passenger ferries to and from Playa del Carmen, as well as for cruise ship tenders. A fifth pier south of downtown is used only for vehicle ferries.

Large parts of the island are covered with mangrove forest which has many endemic animal species. Cozumel is a flat island based on limestone, resulting in a karst topography. The highest natural point on the island is less than above sea level. The cenotes are water-filled sinkholes formed by water percolating through the soft limestone soil for thousands of years. Eighteen deep cenotes and more than 250 shallow bodies exist on the island. Many are under dense vegetation. Jade Cavern Cozumel (Cenote Chempita) near El Cedral is often visited by tourists.

== Fauna ==
Endemic species and subspecies of bird include
* the Cozumel emerald
* the Cozumel great curassow, which is vulnerable
* the Cozumel thrasher, which is nearly, if not already, extinct
* the Cozumel vireo
* the Cozumel wren

Endemic dwarf mammals are found on the island include
* the Cozumel fox, which is nearly, if not already, extinct
* the Cozumel Island coati, which is endangered.
* the Cozumel Island raccoon, which is critically endangered

Three rodents of Cozumel are larger than their mainland counterparts: &quot;Oryzomys couesi&quot;, &quot;Peromyscus leucopus&quot;, and critically endangered &quot;Reithrodontomys spectabilis&quot;, the latter of which is also endemic to the island.

Endemic marine life includes
* the splendid toadfish

Other native wildlife includes
* the American crocodile
* the black spiny-tailed iguana
* the blue land crab (&quot;Cardisoma guanhumi&quot;)

Invasive species include
* the boa constrictor

== Flag ==

The Cozumel flag displays a swallow on a blue and white background. The blue background represents the sea, while the white represents the purity of the Mayans. The sun represents the position of the island in the eastern region of the country, and the swallow indicates the meaning of the word Cozumel in the Mayan language. The sword is Spanish and represents the conquest of the island by the Spaniards in 1521.

== Coral reefs ==

Cozumel is surrounded by a diverse ecosystem of coral reefs that is home to more than 1,000 marine species. The reefs are primarily found on underwater cliffs; some exist in coastal lagoons and on sand bars at the north tip of the island. These reefs are part of the much larger Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, which is the second largest reef in the world, stretching over 1,000 kilometers (620 mi). Cozumel&#x27;s deeper coral reefs were historically famed for their black corals, yet black coral populations declined from the 1960s to the mid-1990s because of overharvesting and by 2016 had not recovered. A large portion of the reef on the south side of the island is sectioned off into the Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park. This park is protected under the Ramsar Convention along with Manglares y Humedales del Norte de Isla Cozumel; they both are included in the UNESCO protected area called Isla Cozumel Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. The reefs in Cozumel are made up of hard coral and soft coral. The marine life that inhabit the reefs include zoanthids, polychaetes, actinarians, hydroids, sponges, crustaceans, mollusks, echinoderms, and many varieties of Caribbean fish. The park is also a habitat to several endangered marine species such as the loggerhead sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, queen triggerfish, and the endemic splendid toadfish. Due to the abundant marine life and coral reefs, as well as the clear and warm Caribbean water, Cozumel is considered one of the best scuba-diving destinations in the world.

Scuba diving is one of Cozumel&#x27;s primary attractions, mainly due to the coral reef on the western shore of Cozumel. These coral reefs are protected from the open ocean by the island&#x27;s natural geography. In 1996, the government of Mexico also established the Cozumel Reefs National Marine Park, forbidding anyone from touching or removing any marine life within the park boundaries. Despite the importance of healthy reefs to Cozumel&#x27;s tourist trade, a deepwater pier was built in the 1990s for cruise ships to dock, causing damage to the reefs, and it is now a regular stop on cruises in the Caribbean. Over the past few decades, coral reef health has significantly declined in Cozumel, with much lower coral cover now present than was historically recorded.

In September 2019, the Marine Park of Cozumel began to close reefs periodically for rehabilitation. They currently close a different reef every two months and the reefs are responding positively.

== Climate ==
Cozumel has a tropical savanna climate under the Köppen climate classification that closely borders on a tropical monsoon climate. The dry season is short, from February to April, but even in these months precipitation averages about of rain per month. The wet season is lengthy, covering most of the months, with September and October being the wettest, when precipitation averages over . Thunderstorms can occasionally occur during the wet season. Temperatures tend to remain stable with little variation from month to month, though the temperatures are cooler from December to February. The coolest month, January, averages . Owing to its proximity to the sea, the island is fairly humid, with an average humidity of 83%. The wettest recorded month was October 1980, with of precipitation and the wettest recorded day was June 19, 1975, with . Extremes range from —recorded January 18, 1977—to .

==History==

The Maya are believed to have first settled Cozumel by the early part of the 1st millennium AD, and older Preclassic Olmec artifacts have been found on the island as well. The island was sacred to Ixchel, the Maya Moon Goddess of fertility.

In the Mayan culture, all women were required to travel to the island at least once to worship Ixchel. She was the wife of Itzamna, the supreme Mayan lord of the skies of the night and of the day. The women asked Ixchel for fertility and for a joyful motherhood. Archeologists continue to unearth small dolls once sacrificed in the fertility rituals.

A number of ruins can be found on the island, most from the Post-Classic period. The largest Maya ruins on the island were near the downtown area and have now been destroyed. Today, the largest remaining ruins are at San Gervasio, located approximately at the center of the island.

The first Spanish expedition to visit Cozumel was led by Juan de Grijalva in 1518. In the following year, Hernán Cortés stopped by the island on his way to Veracruz. The Grijalva and Cortés expeditions were both received peacefully by the Maya of Cozumel (unlike their experiences on the mainland). Even after Cortés destroyed some of the Maya idols on Cozumel and replaced them with an image of the Virgin Mary, the native inhabitants of the island continued to help the Spanish re-supply their ships with food and water so they could continue their voyages. Gerónimo de Aguilar, a captive of the Mayans, was rescued at this time.
As many as 10,000 Maya lived on the island during the early 1500s, but in 1520, infected crew members of the Pánfilo de Narváez expedition brought smallpox to the island, and by 1570, only 186 men and 172 women were left alive on Cozumel. In the ensuing years, Cozumel was often the target of attacks by pirates, and in 1650, many of the islanders were forcibly relocated to the mainland town of Xcan Boloná to avoid the buccaneers&#x27; predation. Later, in 1688, most of the rest of the island&#x27;s population, as well as many of the settlements along the Quintana Roo coast, were evacuated inland to towns such as Chemax. In 1848, refugees escaping the tumult of the Caste War of Yucatán settled on the island, and in 1849 the town of San Miguel de Cozumel was officially recognized by the Mexican government.

In 1861, American President Abraham Lincoln ordered his Secretary of State, William Henry Seward, to meet with the Mexican &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; Matias Romero to explore the possibility of purchasing the island of Cozumel for the purpose of relocating freed American slaves offshore. The idea was summarily dismissed by Mexican President Benito Juarez, and Juarez is still revered by the people of Cozumel because of this action. In 1862, Lincoln did manage to establish a short-lived colony of ex-slaves on Île à Vache off the coast of Haiti.

Work on the original Cozumel airport began when the US needed a stopover to aid World War II planes. While it was able to handle jet aircraft and international flights, it was never a US military base. By 1944, it was only used for emergencies and by the Mexican military. Eventually, Transportes Aeros Mexicanos began using the airport for domestic flights. Cozumel International Airport was built in the late 1970s and expanded in 1999.

On December 18, 2000, 41-year-old British singer-songwriter Kirsty MacColl, died while holidaying there with her sons and her boyfriend musician, James Knight, when a powerboat fatally struck her.
The island was struck directly by two Category 4 hurricanes during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. In July, Hurricane Emily passed just south of Cozumel, exposing the island to the storm&#x27;s intense inner core. It was the larger, stronger, slower-moving Hurricane Wilma that caused the most destruction when it hit the island in October. A category 5 hurricane with winds over 150 miles per hour, Wilma&#x27;s eye passed directly over Cozumel.

The storm caused some damage to the underwater marine habitat. This included the coral reefs, which suffered particularly at the shallower dive sites, and the fish that inhabit the reefs.

Trees, power lines, and cell phone towers were blown down, cars over-turned, piers washed away, windows smashed, roads collapsed, and new rivers appeared.

==Economy==
The economy of Cozumel is based on tourism, including daily visits from cruise ship passengers, as well as tourists scuba diving, snorkeling, and charter fishing. Some controversy exists over the detrimental effects tourism has on the ecosystem of Cozumel.

In addition to restaurants, hotels, and dive shops, vendors near the ports sell a variety of souvenirs and jewelry. All of these contribute greatly to the economy of Cozumel.

Other water activities include para-sailing, kitesurfing, and a tourist submarine. There are also two dolphinariums. The only working pearl farm in the Caribbean is located on the north edge of the island.

San Miguel de Cozumel, the main town on the island, is home to many restaurants with a variety of cuisines, along with several discothèques, bars, cinemas, and outdoor stages. The main plaza is surrounded by shops; in the middle of the plaza is a fixed stage where Cozumeleños (people of Cozumel) and tourists celebrate every Sunday evening with music and dancing.

All food and manufactured supplies are shipped to the island. Water is provided by three different desalination facilities located on the island.

==Education==
There are three universities on the island: the State Public University of Quintana Roo (UQROO) and two private universities, the Partenon Institute and the Interamerican University for Development (UNID). In addition to teaching English as a degree program, they offer other career options including natural resources research, tourism and commercial systems. The Cozumel Arts University offers artist education at the bachelor&#x27;s level.

== Culture ==
=== Santa Cruz Festival and El Cedral Fair ===
The Festival of Santa Cruz and El Cedral Fair is a historical tradition held in the town of El Cedral, in the south of Cozumel Island at the end of April. This annual event is said to have been started over 150 years ago by Casimiro Cárdenas. Cárdenas was one of a group that fled to the island from the village of Saban, on the mainland, after an attack during the Caste War of Yucatán in 1848. The attackers killed other villagers, but Cárdenas survived while clutching a small wooden cross.

Legend has it that Cárdenas vowed to start an annual festival wherever he settled, to honor the religious power of this crucifix. Today, the original Holy Cross (Santa Cruz) Festival forms part of the wider Festival of El Cedral, which includes fairs, traditional feasts, rodeos, bullfights, music and competitions. The celebrations last about five days in all and are held every year at the end of April or beginning of May.

=== Cozumel Carnival ===

The Cozumel Carnival or &quot;Carnaval de Cozumel&quot; is one of the most important carnival festivities in México. It has been celebrated as a tradition beginning from the late nineteenth century and fills Cozumel&#x27;s streets with parades. It begins the week before Mardi-Gras in February. Cozumel&#x27;s Carnival is a tradition which has been passed down through many generations that celebrates a mixture of cultures that escaped to the warm embrace of Cozumel. Dating back to the mid-1800s, Cozumel Carnaval was started by young people dressed in vibrantly colorful costumes known as &quot;Estudiantinas&quot; or &quot;Comparsas&quot;, who expressed themselves in the streets of Cozumel through the artforms of dance, song, and fantasy.

<text>The CBS Evening News is the flagship evening television news program of CBS News, the news division of the CBS television network in the United States. The &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; is a daily evening broadcast featuring news reports, feature stories and interviews by CBS News correspondents and reporters covering events around the world. The program has been broadcast since July 1, 1941, under the original title CBS Television News, eventually adopting its existing title in 1963.

Since January 27, 2025, the flagship nightly broadcast has been co-anchored by Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson from the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City. Previous weeknight anchors have included Douglas Edwards, Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, Connie Chung, Bob Schieffer, Russ Mitchell, Katie Couric, Harry Smith, Scott Pelley, Anthony Mason, Jeff Glor and Norah O&#x27;Donnell.

Saturday and Sunday broadcasts of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; began in February 1966. On May 2, 2016, CBS announced that the weekend edition would be rebranded, effective May 7, 2016, as the &quot;CBS Weekend News&quot;. Weekend newscasts originate from the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City, and are anchored by Jericka Duncan. From 2016 to 2020, the &quot;CBS Weekend News&quot; was anchored by Reena Ninan on Saturday and Elaine Quijano on Sunday. By the summer of 2020 Ninan and Quijano were replaced by Major Garrett and Jamie Yuccas. In December 2020, it was announced that Adriana Diaz and Jericka Duncan would be the new weekend anchors; Diaz left the program in 2024.

The weeknight edition of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; airs live at 6:30 p.m. in the Eastern and 5:30 p.m. in the Central Time Zones and is tape delayed for the Mountain Time Zone. A &quot;Western Edition&quot;, with updated segments covering breaking news stories, airs pre-recorded at 6:30 p.m. for most stations in the Pacific Time Zone and 5:30 p.m. in the Alaska time zone and on tape delay in the Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone. At midnight Eastern, the Western Edition is posted on the website for CBS News and their YouTube channel. The Western Edition additionally airs along with the weekend versions on CBS News 24/7.

As of April 11, 2024, &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; remains in third place of the three major television news programs, with around 4,969,000 total viewers.

==History==
===Early years (1941–1948)===
Upon becoming commercial station WCBW (channel 2, later WCBS-TV) on July 1, 1941, the pioneer CBS television station in New York City broadcast two daily news programs, at 2:30 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. weekdays, anchored by Richard Hubbell. Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was normally off the air on Sunday to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45 p.m. with an extensive special report. The national emergency broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come to the CBS television studios at Grand Central Station from the radio network base at 485 Madison Avenue, to give information and commentary on the attack. The WCBW special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes, but it pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 &quot;was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time.&quot;

Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of World War II, including &quot;War Backgrounds&quot; (December 1941–February 1942), &quot;World This Week&quot; (February–April 1942), and &quot;America At War&quot; (March–May 1942). In May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) temporarily suspended studio operations, which resulted in the station sharply cutting back its live program schedule, and resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily because much of the staff had either joined the military service or were redeployed to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were impossible to repair due to the wartime lack of parts.

In May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened the studios and the newscasts returned, briefly anchored by Ned Calmer, followed by Alan Jackson, Everett Holles, and Dwight Cooke. After the war, expanded news programs appeared on the WCBW schedule. The station&#x27;s call letters were changed to WCBS-TV in 1946. Anchors included Bob McKee, Milo Boulton, Jim McMullin, Larry LeSueur, Tom O’Connor, and, beginning in 1947, Douglas Edwards.

===Douglas Edwards (1948–1962)===

On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring &quot;CBS Television News&quot;, as a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. It aired every weeknight at 7:30 p.m., and was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor. (WCBW/WCBS-TV newscasts prior to this time were local television broadcasts seen only in New York City.) NBC&#x27;s offering at the time, &quot;NBC Television Newsreel&quot;, which premiered in February 1948, was simply film footage with voice narration.

The network also broadcast a recap of the week&#x27;s news stories on a Sunday night program titled &quot;Newsweek in Review&quot;, which was later moved to Saturday and retitled &quot;The Week in Review&quot;. In 1950, the nightly newscast was renamed &quot;Douglas Edwards with the News&quot;, and in September the following year it became the first news program to be broadcast simultaneously on the East Coast and West Coast through the installation of a new coaxial cable connection. That transcontinental link prompted Edwards to start each broadcast with the updated greeting &quot;Good evening everyone, coast to coast.&quot;

On November 30, 1956, the program became the first to use the new technology of videotape to time delay the broadcast (which originated in New York City) for the western United States.

===Walter Cronkite (1962–1981)===

On April 16, 1962, Walter Cronkite succeeded Edwards, and the broadcast was retitled &quot;Walter Cronkite with the News&quot;. On September 2, 1963, the newscast, retitled &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, became the first half-hour weeknight news broadcast on network television and was moved to 6:30 p.m. Eastern time (NBC&#x27;s &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; expanded to 30 minutes exactly one week later on September 9, 1963). As before, some affiliates (including flagship owned-and-operated station WCBS-TV in New York City) had the option of carrying a later edition, scheduled at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. NBC also allowed this practice for the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;, with ABC later following it for the &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; (now &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;). The networks ended this practice after 1971, although some affiliates – mostly in larger markets – continued to carry the national newscasts at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on a half-hour tape delay.

The &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; was first transmitted in color as a one-evening test broadcast on August 19, 1965, before permanently switching to the format on January 31, 1966. Cronkite&#x27;s prime time special report, &quot;Who, What, When, Where, Why&quot;, broadcast on February 27, 1968, ended with his declaration that the United States could only hope for a stalemate in Vietnam. It is often credited with influencing Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s decision to drop out of the race for President. &quot;If I&#x27;ve lost Walter Cronkite... [I]&#x27;ve lost Middle America,&quot; he stated.

Under Cronkite, the newscast began what would eventually become an 18-year period of dominating the ratings among the network evening news programs. In the process, Cronkite became &quot;the most trusted man in America&quot; according to a Gallup Poll, a status that had first been fostered in November 1963 through his coverage of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

In late 1972, Cronkite prodded the show&#x27;s producers to feature two nights of lengthy explanation on the Watergate scandal, which had been extensively covered by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, but had not received major national coverage. After the first half of the report, shown on a Friday, ran for 14 minutes, roughly half of the air time of the broadcast, White House officials complained to CBS founder William S. Paley. The second half of the report was aired the following Monday, but only for eight minutes.

===Dan Rather (1981–2005)===

====1981–1993====

Cronkite was replaced as anchor of the program the Monday after his retirement, March 9, 1981, by 49-year-old Dan Rather, who had been with CBS News as a correspondent since the early 1960s and later became a correspondent for the network&#x27;s newsmagazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Concerns about excessive liberalism in the media were frequently leveled at Rather, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, CBS News, and CBS in general. Some of these concerns dated from Rather&#x27;s position as White House correspondent for the network&#x27;s news division during the Nixon administration. A shouting match with Vice President George H. W. Bush during an interview on live television in January 1988 related to the Iran–Contra affair did little to dispel those concerns. Rather unapologetically defended his behavior in statements the following day, and Bush went on to win the presidential election in November.

Earlier, on September 1, 1986, amidst a brewing battle among CBS&#x27;s Board of Directors for control of the company and turmoil at CBS News, Rather closed his Monday broadcast with the word &quot;courage,&quot; repeating it the following night. On September 3, Rather said the masculine noun for the Spanish word for &quot;courage,&quot; &quot;coraje&quot; (the primary translation for &quot;courage&quot; in Spanish is &quot;valor&quot;). In the face of media attention and pleas from his staff, Rather abandoned the signoff on September 8.

On September 11, 1987, Rather marched off camera in anger just before a remote broadcast of the program when it appeared that CBS Sports&#x27; coverage of a U.S. Open tennis semifinal match between Steffi Graf and Lori McNeil was going to run over into time allotted for the newscast. Rather was in Miami covering the visit to the city by Pope John Paul II. When the tennis match ended sooner than expected at 6:32 p.m. Eastern Time, Rather was nowhere to be found, and six minutes of dead air followed before he returned to the broadcast position; nearly half of the audience watched and waited. Rather attempted to explain his actions with a statement release on Sunday, but made no mention of it on his next newscast on Monday, delayed by the men&#x27;s final. By 1990, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; had fallen to third place in the ratings, behind ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight with Peter Jennings&quot; and &quot;NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw&quot;.

On January 22, 1991, demonstrators from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) broke into the CBS News studio and chanted &quot;Fight AIDS, not Arabs&quot; during the show&#x27;s introduction. One protester was seen on camera just as Rather began speaking. Rather immediately called for a commercial break, however, the screen went black instead for six seconds before returning to Rather. He apologized twice to viewers about the incident.

====Connie Chung as co-anchor (1993–1995)====
On May 31, 1993, CBS News correspondent Connie Chung began co-anchoring the broadcast with Rather. Chung normally co-anchored in the studio with Rather, but sometimes one of them appeared on location, while the other remained in the studio. Though Rather never said so publicly, CBS News insiders said he did not approve of her appointment. Chung&#x27;s last broadcast as co-anchor was on May 19, 1995.

====1995–2005====
The newscast returned to a solo anchor format on May 22, 1995, with Dan Rather continuing in his role as anchor. At age 73, Rather retired from the &quot;Evening News&quot; on March 9, 2005, exactly 24 years after succeeding Cronkite.

Rather left the anchor position amid controversy and a credibility crisis over reports broadcast during the 2004 presidential election campaign. The report was a segment featured on a September 2004 broadcast of &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot;, questioning President George W. Bush&#x27;s Texas Air National Guard record. Conservative activists challenged the authenticity of the documents used for the report. A number of bloggers analyzed scans of the documents, and rapidly concluded they were forgeries. Subsequently, CBS commissioned an independent inquiry into the matter and several CBS staffers were fired or asked to resign.

After departing from the &quot;Evening News&quot;, Rather remained with CBS News as a correspondent. On June 20, 2006, CBS News President Sean McManus announced that Rather and CBS had agreed to end his 44-year career with the network.

===Bob Schieffer (2005–2006)===

On March 10, 2005, Rather was succeeded on an interim basis by &quot;Face the Nation&quot; host and CBS News correspondent Bob Schieffer. At the time Schieffer took over, it was uncertain how long he would host the broadcast, whether it would retain its current structure, or instead adopt some kind of multiple host or alternative format. Under Rather in the years leading up to his retirement, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; trailed its rivals at ABC and NBC by a fairly large margin. White House correspondent John Roberts, and Scott Pelley, his predecessor in that position, were often mentioned as possible successors to Rather when he retired. Jim Axelrod became White House correspondent when Roberts later left for CNN.

In the months following Rather&#x27;s departure, the program came to emphasize live exchanges between Schieffer and various CBS News correspondents around the world. In contrast to traditional network news practice, these exchanges were unrehearsed as part of an effort to make the language on the broadcast sound more &quot;natural&quot;. Viewership increased over this period, with the program being the only network evening news broadcast to gain viewers during 2005. In November 2005, CBS announced that &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; executive producer Jim Murphy would be replaced by Rome Hartman, who took over in January 2006.

Schieffer led the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; to become the #2 evening news broadcast, ahead of ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot;. The ABC News division was in flux following the death of anchor Peter Jennings in 2005, and, with the adoption of a dual-anchor format on &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, life-threatening injuries suffered by co-anchor Bob Woodruff in January 2006 when an Iraqi military convoy he rode in hit a roadside bomb, leaving Elizabeth Vargas as sole anchor. When Charles Gibson was appointed sole anchor of &quot;World News Tonight&quot; in May 2006, after Elizabeth Vargas resigned in connection with her pregnancy, ABC regained stability and momentum to regain the #2 spot.

Bob Schieffer&#x27;s final &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; program was broadcast on August 31, 2006. Russ Mitchell filled in for the following nights (September 1, 2006 &amp; September 4 2006), after which he was succeeded by Katie Couric on September 5, 2006.

===Katie Couric (2006–2011)===

On December 1, 2005, it was reported that Katie Couric, co-anchor of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, was considering an offer by CBS to anchor the &quot;Evening News&quot;. Couric officially signed a contract to become anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; on April 1, 2006, and formally announced four days later on &quot;Today&quot; that she would be leaving the show and NBC News after a 15-year run as the morning show&#x27;s co-anchor. Ratings during Couric&#x27;s period as anchor fluctuated, seemingly improving at times, but also posting historic lows rivaling those dating back to at least the 1991–92 season.

Couric began working at CBS News in July 2006. During her first broadcast as anchor on September 5, 2006, a new graphics package and set, and a new theme composed by Academy Award-winning composer James Horner were introduced. Similar graphics and music would be introduced on other CBS News programs such as &quot;Up to the Minute&quot;, &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; and &quot;The Early Show&quot; throughout the month of October. A new opening title sequence was designed, with Walter Cronkite providing the voiceover, replacing Wendell Craig unless a temporary voice-over was needed. Following Cronkite&#x27;s death months earlier, actor Morgan Freeman recorded a new voice-over for the title sequence, which debuted on January 4, 2010. The program also debuted a new feature called &quot;freeSpeech&quot; in which different Americans, ranging from well-known national figures to average people, would provide news commentary. After overwhelmingly negative reaction, the segment was discontinued.

On March 8, 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the program&#x27;s executive producer Rome Hartman was being replaced by television news veteran Rick Kaplan. Hartman left as executive producer on March 7. Kaplan came to the &quot;Evening News&quot; after stints at MSNBC, CNN, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight with Peter Jennings&quot;.

On April 4, 2007, Couric read a one-minute commentary about the importance of reading, in a piece substantially lifted from a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; column by Jeffrey Zaslow. Couric appeared to personally reminisce about her first library card — &quot;I still remember when I got my first library card, browsing through the stacks for my favorite books&quot; — but the words were all Zaslow&#x27;s. It was later determined that a producer had actually plagiarized the piece, and the video was subsequently removed from the CBS News website. Zaslow responded that CBS had &quot;been very gracious and apologetic, and we at the &quot;Journal&quot; appreciate it.&quot; Furthermore, this was a notable case of &quot;double plagiarism&quot;: the producer claimed the text from Zaslow, and the anchor claimed the words from the producer. That producer, Melissa McNamara, was fired hours after the &quot;Journal&quot; contacted CBS News to complain. The network promised changes to its procedures.

On July 28, 2008, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; became the third network evening newscast to begin broadcasting in high definition (behind &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and PBS&#x27;s &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot;).

On August 27, 2008, Mediabistro wrote a piece about the Big Three network newscasts, praising Couric&#x27;s &quot;Evening News&quot; for extensive reporting that had, in its opinion, content better than its rivals. Another critic from MarketWatch praised Couric&#x27;s work and said that people should watch out for her in 2009. &quot;Washington Post&quot; writer Tom Shales praised Couric as a warmer, more benevolent presence than her two competitors, something that she brought to the program nearly 16 years of goodwill from doing &quot;Today&quot; and becoming America&#x27;s sweetheart, or else very close to it, and he claimed that this goodwill remained. Shales added that viewers &quot;may find bad news less discomforting and sleep-depriving if Couric gives it to them&quot;. He also added that she does not try to &quot;sugarcoat&quot; or &quot;prettify&quot; grim realities. According to Shales, the &quot;Evening News&quot; may be a more hospitable, welcoming sort of place than its competitors. He concluded by stating that &quot;it&#x27;s naive to think that viewers choose their news anchor based solely on strict journalistic credentials, though Couric&#x27;s do seem to be in order, despite her critics&#x27; claims.&quot;

The &quot;CBS Evening News with Katie Couric&quot; won the 2008 and 2009 Edward R. Murrow Award for best newscast. In September 2008, Couric interviewed Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, earning respect from a MarketWatch critic for asking tough questions. In 2011, the program was the recipient of both an Emmy for Outstanding Continuing Coverage and the Edward R. Murrow Award for Video News Series for foreign correspondent Terry McCarthy&#x27;s feature story &quot;Afghan Bomb Squad.&quot;

On May 18, 2009, the newscast&#x27;s graphics were overhauled, using a blue and red color scheme with web-influenced motifs and layouts. The new graphics design featured a look influenced by the graphics that CBS used during the 2008 presidential election coverage.

On April 3, 2011, the Associated Press reported that Couric would be leaving the &quot;Evening News&quot; when her contract expired in June. Couric later confirmed her departure to &quot;People&quot; magazine, citing a desire for &quot;a format that will allow (her) to engage in more multi-dimensional storytelling.&quot; On May 13, 2011, Couric announced that the following Thursday, May 19, 2011, would be her last broadcast.

Despite originally retooling the newscasts to add more features, interviews, and human interest stories, over time it returned to the hard news format popularized by Cronkite. Harry Smith served as an interim anchor until Pelley&#x27;s tenure started on June 6, 2011 (like Couric before him, Smith would also depart from CBS a month later).

===Scott Pelley (2011–2017)===
In an April 2011 article, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondent Scott Pelley was considered to be the front-runner to replace Couric as anchor of the program.

On May 3, 2011, CBS confirmed that Pelley would replace Couric as anchor for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; in June. The graphics were subtly updated (the Couric 2009-2011 graphics were used for the first two days of Pelley&#x27;s tenure as anchor in 2011), the American flag background on the news set (which had been used since the 2008 elections, this was last used on Harry Smith interim anchor episodes until 2011) was replaced by a replica of the globe fixture during the Cronkite era, and the James Horner theme was replaced by the 1987–91 theme composed by Trivers-Myers Music that was used during the Rather era (the theme was last used on Up to the Minute on June 24, 2011, and was replaced by the Rather and Pelley theme the same year).
In his first nine months in the anchor chair, Pelley gained an additional 821,000 viewers. CBS News also enjoyed increases in its audience for special news events. After election night in 2012, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;With Scott Pelley front and center; the Eye was up 8% from four years ago.&quot; The CBS Evening News had increased its audience every year from 2011 through 2015. On May 29, 2015, media website The Wrap wrote: &quot;These days, CBS brass may finally have a reason to smile. On Wednesday, the network announced &#x27;Evening News with Scott Pelley&#x27; added more than 1.25 million viewers over the past four years – a whopping 21 percent jump. The show also saw audience growth for the fifth consecutive season, the first time any network evening news broadcast has done that since 1987.&quot;

At the end of the 2015–2016 television season, CBS News announced, &quot;&quot;The CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley&quot;, America&#x27;s fastest growing network evening news broadcast, finished the 2015–16 television season with CBS&#x27;s highest ratings in the time period in 10 years (since the 2005–06 season), according to Nielsen most current ratings. The CBS Evening News has grown its audience for six consecutive seasons, a first-time achievement for any network evening news broadcast since the advent of people meters (since at least 1987). Under Pelley, who assumed the anchor chair in June 2011, the CBS Evening News added 1.4 million viewers and an audience increase of 23%, double NBC and ABC&#x27;s growth combined over the same period (since the 2010–11 season).

Pelley re-focused the program towards hard news and away from the soft news and infotainment features of the early Katie Couric era. Story selection focused more on foreign policy, Washington politics, and economic subjects. The program&#x27;s audience viewership began to grow immediately, closing the gap between the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and its competitors by one million viewers within a year, although the CBS program remains in third place among the network evening newscasts. In late May 2016, a new theme tune composed by Joel Beckerman of Man Made Music was introduced. Later that same year in December, the program moved permanently into CBS Studio 57, which the newscast used during their 2016 election coverage (moving from its longtime home of studio 47) at the CBS Broadcast Center and gained a new set to go with it.

=== Anthony Mason (June 2017–December 2017) ===
On May 30, 2017, reports surfaced confirming that Scott Pelley had been relieved of his duties at &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. Pelley remained at CBS News as a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondent. Pelley reportedly asked staff members to clear out his office. The move was made official on May 31, 2017, and Anthony Mason was named interim anchor. On June 6, 2017, &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; announced that Pelley would anchor until June 16, 2017.

===Jeff Glor (2017–2019)===

On October 25, 2017, CBS News announced that correspondent Jeff Glor would be the new &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor. On November 26, 2017, the organization announced his first official air date for December 4, 2017. Together with Glor&#x27;s debut, the newscast also updated its looks and used a new logotype and updated typography, using Ridley Grotesk as its base. However, the theme music and set from the later Pelley era were retained.

=== Rotating hosts (May–July 2019) ===
On May 6, 2019, it was announced that Glor would leave &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. The last day of his tenure was May 10, 2019. John Dickerson, Major Garrett, Margaret Brennan, Anthony Mason, David Begnaud, James Brown, Jane Pauley, Jim Axelrod, Maurice DuBois, and Tony Dokoupil anchored on an interim basis until Norah O&#x27;Donnell took the anchor chair on July 15, 2019.

===Norah O&#x27;Donnell (2019–2025)===

On May 6, 2019, CBS News announced that Norah O&#x27;Donnell was named anchor and managing editor of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; to replace Glor, effective July 15, 2019. It also announced that the show would be moving to Washington, D.C., on December 2, 2019. This marked the first time that a major network evening news program was based outside of New York since 1978, when &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; used bureaus in Washington, Chicago and London for its broadcast. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s approach has been described by her as &quot;hard news with heart&quot;, combining investigative reporting and original storytelling which connects with people and is solutions-oriented.

On April 8, 2022, it was reported that O&#x27;Donnell had renewed her contract through at least the 2024 presidential election. A rebranding of the program was unveiled on August 29, 2022, featuring a world map motif (a design that has frequently been used in CBS News programming as an homage to Walter Cronkite&#x27;s era) and elements of the CBS brand identity first introduced in 2020. As part of the rebrand, the show introduced a new theme composed by Antfood, which is an arrangement of the 1987−91 Trivers-Myers theme used during Dan Rather and Scott Pelley&#x27;s tenures as anchor during their respective eras (1987 and 2011), and incorporates Antfood&#x27;s sonic branding for the network.

===John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois (2025–present)===

On July 30, 2024, O&#x27;Donnell announced that she would step down as anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; after the 2024 elections. She remains with CBS News as a senior correspondent. On August 1, CBS News announced that the &quot;Evening News&quot; would undergo a retool and introduce a multi-anchor format with an emphasis on its &quot;ensemble of journalists&quot;; John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois would serve as co-anchors, while Margaret Brennan of &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and WCBS-TV weather reporter Lonnie Quinn would serve as regular contributors for politics and weather-related topics. &quot;60 Minutes&quot; executive producer Bill Owens was named supervising producer, and fellow &quot;60 Minutes&quot; producer Guy Campanile was named executive producer. O&#x27;Donnell anchored her final edition of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; on January 23, 2025, with Dickerson and DuBois debuting on January 27, 2025.

The retooled &quot;Evening News&quot; carries a news magazine-like format with a focus on in-depth stories, rather than the headline-focused formats of its main competitors (with these relegated to a short &quot;RoundUp&quot; segment at the end of the opening block, which features brief summaries of other headlines). CBS News and Stations CEO Wendy McMahon explained that the program would share the &quot;values&quot; of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and make use of its correspondents, aiming for the program to be &quot;[where] they have big news to break&quot;. Dickerson explained that &quot;people have the news all day in their pockets, and we&#x27;re not trying to compete with that. What we can share is the perspective that comes from the deep reporting that our correspondents do.&quot; DuBois emphasized the increased emphasis on correspondents in the new format, explaining that they would &quot;feel like people you know describing incredible things that they just witnessed.&quot; By February 12, 2025, the format began to see changes, including some broadcasts featuring a more traditional &quot;tease&quot; in the introduction, or leading with conventional, headline-based packages in the opening block rather than immediately beginning with a newsmagazine-like story.

Production returned to studio 47 at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City, with a new studio utilizing a three-sided video wall. The theme music adopted in 2022 was also dropped, with the original version of the Trivers-Myers theme reinstated. 

Alongside the new &quot;Evening News&quot;, CBS also announced that it would introduce a half-hour extension—&quot;CBS Evening News Plus&quot;— anchored by Dickerson. Similarly to &quot;CBS Mornings Plus&quot; (introduced in September 2024), which premiered two weeks later on February 10, 2025. The program features several additional key segments, such as &quot;The Interview&quot;, and &quot;In Depth&quot;. The program streams on CBS News 24/7, and airs on selected CBS owned-and-operated stations (predominantly on the West Coast) immediately following the main program.

==Weekend editions==
The &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; expanded to weekend evenings in February 1966, originally anchored by Roger Mudd. The Sunday edition of the program was dropped in September 1971, when CBS began airing &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in the 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time (5:00 p.m. Central) slot in order to help affiliates fulfill requirements imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s Prime Time Access Rule. The Sunday edition returned in January 1976, when the network moved &quot;60 Minutes &quot;one hour later to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, where that program remains to this day (except when the NFL on CBS is scheduled to air a doubleheader; on those Sundays, &quot;60 Minutes &quot;is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET).

From 2011 to 2014, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; was the only remaining network evening newscast that used separate anchors for its Saturday and Sunday editions (&quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; previously used separate anchors for both weekend broadcasts until John Seigenthaler was appointed anchor of both the Saturday and Sunday editions in 1999, while ABC&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot; maintained separate anchors for its weekend editions until Saturday anchor David Muir also assumed anchor duties on the program&#x27;s Sunday edition in 2011). John Roberts did anchor both Saturday and Sunday editions of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; for several months in 1999. More recently, Russ Mitchell served as the weekend anchor for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; until December 2011, when he announced his resignation from CBS News to take a lead anchor position with NBC affiliate WKYC-TV in Cleveland, Ohio. The following year, Mitchell was replaced on the weekend editions by Jim Axelrod on Saturdays and Jeff Glor on Sundays.

Weekend editions of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; were periodically abbreviated or preempted outright due to CBS Sports programming. On May 2, 2016, CBS announced that the weekend editions of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, effective May 7, would be revamped as the &quot;CBS Weekend News&quot;, with the Saturday and Sunday editions anchored by Reena Ninan and Elaine Quijano, respectively. (The Saturday edition airs only on the West Coast from September through mid-December due to CBS&#x27;s college football coverage; the Sunday edition similarly only airs on the West Coast most weeks from September through January due to the network&#x27;s NFL coverage, except when a doubleheader is not scheduled.) The new program would rely on resources from CBS&#x27;s streaming news channel CBSN (now CBS News 24/7), as well as reports from local affiliates, and highlights from the past week. CBS News executive editor Steve Capus argued that &quot;given the number of sports overruns and out-and-out pre-emptions, it would be better for us as a news organization to come up with what I think is a smarter, 24-hour approach to covering the world, and making sure we&#x27;ve got all the bases covered.&quot;

=== Impact of COVID-19 ===
In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the temporary shutdown of the CBS Broadcast Center after a number of CBS News staffers tested positive for the virus. While the network did reopen the facility for a brief period, further positive tests along with a number of corporate directives by CBS News President Susan Zirinsky resulted in a second, indefinite shutdown of the Broadcast Center. With no live weekend sporting events for the next three months (primarily due to the cancellation of CBS&#x27;s March Madness coverage as well as the temporary pause of the 2019–20 PGA Tour season) resulting in no likely sports pre-emptions, production of the &quot;CBS Weekend News&quot; was dramatically altered with CBS News staffers outsourcing certain production services to select CBS-owned stations and affiliates, who would originate the newscasts from the stations&#x27; respective studios with the station or affiliate&#x27;s main anchors serving as the program&#x27;s anchor for the weekend. The usage of local CBS stations and affiliates was, in part, to reduce the pressure on CBS News&#x27; Washington, D.C. bureau, where the weeknight &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; is based, as it had already taken on increased responsibilities during the pandemic.

The following CBS affiliates assisted with production of the &quot;CBS Weekend News&quot; from March 14 until May 31:

* March 14–15: KCBS Los Angeles (CBS O&amp;O)
* March 21–22 &amp; 28-29: KTVT Fort Worth-Dallas (CBS O&amp;O)
* April 4–5: KCNC Denver (CBS O&amp;O)
* April 11–12: KHOU Houston
* April 18–19: WGCL Atlanta
* April 25–26: WUSA Washington, D.C.
* May 2–3: KIRO Seattle
* May 9–10: WTTV Indianapolis
* May 16–17: KOIN Portland, Oregon
* May 23–24: KOVR Sacramento (CBS O&amp;O)
* May 30–31: KMOV St. Louis

From June 7, 2020 (a special Saturday edition of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; covering the weekend&#x27;s George Floyd protests aired the previous day), until December 2020, with CBS Sports set to resume live coverage of the PGA Tour, CBS News resumed full production of the &quot;CBS Weekend News&quot; with either chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett or Los Angeles correspondent Jamie Yuccas presiding as anchor, as production for all CBS News programs from the CBS Broadcast Center remained temporarily suspended. On December 4, 2020, CBS News announced correspondents Adriana Diaz and Jericka Duncan would be promoted into permanent anchor positions, with Diaz leading the Saturday edition from the network&#x27;s Chicago bureau at WBBM-TV and Duncan leading the Sunday edition from the CBS Broadcast Center. Diaz left the &quot;CBS Weekend News&quot; in September 2024 to become a co-host for &quot;CBS Mornings Plus&quot;; on October 4, CBS announced that Jericka Duncan would add the program&#x27;s Saturday edition to her Sunday duties.

==Western edition==
CBS introduced a Western edition of the program in 1979, which was anchored by Terry Drinkwater with staff based in its Los Angeles bureau being placed on standby for updates to the main &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; broadcast each weeknight; this lasted until September 1985, when CBS News instituted layoffs at the Los Angeles bureau following a successful fending off of a takeover attempt of the network by Ted Turner. The program eventually resumed production of the Western edition from its New York City and Washington studios (which may also be produced from remote locations where the program is broadcast when warranted). The host previously announced, &quot;good evening to our viewers in the West&quot; and packages may be updated to reflect late breaking news.

==Audio format==
Former CBS Radio owned news stations had aired an audio simulcast of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; airs weekdays. KYW is the last of these stations to do so. Only the first thirteen to fifteen minutes of the broadcast are aired, before resuming regular programming.

WCLO airs an audio simulcast of the entire &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; from Madison-based WISC-TV.

In addition to a radio broadcast, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; is also available as a podcast.

==International broadcasts==
In Australia, the program is shown daily on Sky News Australia at 11:30 a.m. in New Zealand, Sky News broadcasts the program live at 1:30 a.m. local time.

From March 17, 1987, until the early 2000s, the program was shown daily (from Tuesday to Saturday) with French subtitles on French network Canal+ at 7:00 a.m. every morning.

The program was broadcast on the American Network in Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador.

In Japan, the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; was shown on BS-TBS as part of that network&#x27;s morning news program.

The &quot;Evening News&quot; was broadcast live on ATV World in Hong Kong daily until January 1, 2009. 

Belize&#x27;s Tropical Vision Limited occasionally airs the program as a substitute for its airing of the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; on Saturdays and occasionally during the week.

<doc id="194742" wikidata="Q4346186" url="?curid=194742" title="Japanese submarine I-52 (1942)">
<text>, code-named was a Type C3 cargo submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy used during World War II for a secret mission to Lorient, France, then occupied by Germany, during which she was sunk.

==Valuable cargo==
She is also known as Japan&#x27;s &quot;Golden Submarine&quot;, because she was carrying a cargo of gold to Germany as payment for matériel and technology. There has been speculation that a peace proposal to the Allies was contained on board the &quot;I-52&quot; as well, but this is unlikely on two counts: there is no evidence that the Japanese government was interested in peace proposals or negotiated settlements at that stage in the war; and the Japanese kept an open dialogue with their diplomatic attachés via radio and diplomatic voucher through Russia, and had no need for long and uncertain transfer via a submarine bound for a Nazi-controlled area of western Europe.

It is believed that 800 kg (1,760-lbs) of uranium oxide awaited &quot;I-52&quot; for her return voyage at Lorient according to Ultra decrypts. It has been speculated that this was for the Japanese to develop a radiological weapon (a so-called &quot;dirty bomb&quot;) for use against the United States. (The amount of unenriched uranium oxide would not have been enough to create an atomic bomb, though if used in a nuclear reactor it could have created poisonous fission products).

She was also to be fitted with a snorkel device at Lorient. In addition, 35 to 40 tons of secret documents, drawings, and strategic cargo awaited &quot;I-52&quot;″s return trip to Japan: T-5 acoustic torpedoes, a Jumo 213-A motor used on the long-nosed Focke-Wulf Fw 190D fighter, radar equipment, vacuum tubes, ball bearings, bombsights, chemicals, alloy steel, and optical glass.

==Type C3 submarines==
This class of submarines was designed and built by Mitsubishi Corporation, between 1943 and 1944, as cargo carriers. They were quite long and carried a crew of up to 94. They also had a long cruising range at a speed of . The Japanese constructed only three of these submarines during World War II (&quot;I-52&quot;, and ), although twenty were planned. They were the largest submarines ever built at that time, before the enormous &quot;Sentoku&quot; subs were built, and were known as the most advanced Japanese submarines of their time.

The keel of &quot;I-52&quot; was laid on 18 March 1942, and she was commissioned on 28 December 1943 into the 11th Submarine Squadron, Kure Naval District, with Commander Kameo Uno as the commanding officer. In January 1944, Admiral Mineichi Koga, the commander of the Combined Fleet, selected &quot;I-52&quot; for a special mission to Germany.

==Yanagi missions==
Yanagi missions were enabled under the Axis Powers&#x27; Tripartite Pact to provide for an exchange of strategic materials and manufactured goods between Germany, Italy and Japan. Initially, cargo ships made the exchanges, but when that was no longer possible submarines were used.

Only five other submarines had attempted this intercontinental voyage during World War II: (April 1942), (June 1943), (October 1943), (November 1943), and (August 1943). Of these, &quot;I-30&quot; was sunk by a mine, &quot;I-34&quot; by the British submarine , and &quot;I-29&quot; by the United States submarine (assisted by Ultra intelligence).

==Fatal voyage==

On 10 March 1944, on her maiden voyage, &quot;I-52&quot;, led by Commander Kameo Uno, departed Kure via Sasebo for Singapore. Her cargo from Japan included 9.8 tons of molybdenum, 11 tons of tungsten, 2.2 tons of gold in 146 bars packed in 49 metal boxes, 3 tons of opium and 54 kg of caffeine. The gold was payment for German technology. She also carried 14 passengers, primarily Japanese technicians, who were to study German technology in anti-aircraft guns and engines for torpedo boats.

In Singapore she picked up a further 120 tons of tin in ingots, 59.8 tons of caoutchouc (raw rubber) in bales and 3.3 tons of quinine, and headed through the Indian Ocean, to the Atlantic Ocean.

On 6 June 1944, the Japanese naval attaché in Berlin, Rear Admiral Kojima Hideo, signaled the submarine that the Allies had landed in Normandy, thus threatening her eventual destination of Lorient on the coast of France. She was advised to prepare for Norway instead. She was also instructed to rendezvous with a German submarine on 22 June 1944 at 21:15 (GMT) at the co-ordinates . &quot;I-52&quot; responded with her position, being . The message was intercepted and decoded by US intelligence; &quot;I-52&quot; had been closely watched all the way from Singapore. Guided by the F-21 Submarine Tracking Room and F-211 &quot;Secret Room&quot; of the Tenth Fleet which was in charge of the Atlantic section, a hunter-killer task force was targeted towards her.

On the night of 22 June 1944 about west of the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa, &quot;I-52&quot; rendezvoused with , a Type IXC/40 U-boat commanded by Kapitänleutnant Kurt Lange. &quot;U-530&quot; provided her with fuel, and also transferred a Naxos FuMB 7 radar detector, and an Enigma coding machine, along with two radar operators, Petty Officers Kurt Schulze and Rolf Behrendt, and a German liaison officer for the trip through the Bay of Biscay, Kapitänleutnant Alfred Schafer.

===US task force===
A US task force assembled as a submarine hunter-killer group, consisting of the escort carrier USS &quot;Bogue&quot; and five destroyer escorts, en route to the United States from Europe, was ordered to find and destroy the Japanese submarine. This task force departed from Casablanca on 15 June 1944, and was commanded by Captain Aurelius B. Vosseller. It also had 9 General Motors FM-2 Wildcats and 12 Grumman TBF-1C Avengers of VC-69 on board. The task force, on its way from Hampton Roads to Casablanca, had sunk another Japanese submarine, the Type IX &quot;RO-501&quot; (formerly &quot;U-1224&quot;) on 13 May 1944. This was a very effective force, sinking 13 German and Japanese submarines between February 1943 and July 1945.

The five destroyer escorts were:
* , Lieutenant J. E. Johansen.
* , Commander T. S. Lank, TF 51 commander.
* , Lieutenant R. E. Peek.
* , Lieutenant Commander G. R. Atterbury.
* , Lieutenant Commander H. E. Cross.

Arriving in the area of the meeting on the evening of 23 June, the carrier began launching flights of Avengers at around 23:00 GMT to search for the submarines. &quot;U-530&quot; escaped undetected.

At approximately 23:40, Ed Whitlock, the radar operator in Lieutenant Commander Jesse D. Taylor&#x27;s Avenger aircraft, detected a surface contact on his malfunctioning radar (only the right half of its sweep was working). Taylor immediately dropped flares, illuminating the area, and attacked. After his first pass, he saw the depth charge explosions just to starboard of the submarine – a near miss – and the submarine dived. Taylor dropped a purple sonobuoy, a newly developed underwater microphone that floated on the surface to pick up underwater sounds and transmit them to the aircraft. A searching aircraft usually drops these in packs of five, code-named purple, orange, blue, red and yellow (POBRY). The operator is able to monitor each buoy, in turn, to listen for sounds emitted by the enemy craft.

Hearing what sounded like submarine propeller sounds, Taylor began a torpedo attack, dropping a Mark 24 &quot;mine&quot;. The Mark 24, code-name &quot;Fido&quot; and designated a &quot;mine&quot; for secrecy, was actually the first Allied acoustic torpedo, developed by the Harvard Underwater Sound Lab, which homed in on noises made by the submarine. Within minutes of dropping the torpedo, Taylor&#x27;s sonobuoys detected the sounds of an explosion and a hull breaking up.

As Commander Taylor&#x27;s watch ended, the operators on &quot;USS Bogue&quot; and Taylor all thought he had sunk the sub. However, as Taylor&#x27;s patrol ended, he was relieved by Lieutenant Junior Grade William &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon, accompanied by civilian underwater sound expert Price Fish. They arrived on the scene just after midnight and circled with Taylor for some time. At about 0100 on 24 June 1944, Fish reported hearing some faint propeller noise in the area.

Captain Vosseller ordered a second attack; Gordon checked with Taylor about the exact position of the sonobuoy and dropped another &quot;Fido&quot; torpedo where he believed the submarine to be. Taylor departed the area at 0115, but Gordon stayed to circle the area and listen for any sign of activity. He heard nothing and was relieved by Lieutenant (junior grade) Brady, who continued to watch and listen, but no further activity was reported. Next morning, &quot;USS Janssen&quot; reached the site () and found flotsam: a ton of raw rubber, a piece of silk, and human flesh.

The sonobuoy recording of the last few moments of &quot;I-52″s&quot; sound still survives in the US National Archives in Washington D.C. in the form of two thin-film canisters marked &quot;Gordon wire No. 1&quot; and &quot;Gordon wire No. 2&quot; dated 24 June 1944. The wire from Taylor&#x27;s attack has not been found; however, a set of 78 rpm vinyl recordings that include segments of Taylor&#x27;s wire recordings has been located. These records were produced during the war for training pilots. On the wire and vinyl recordings, Lieutenant Gordon can be heard talking to his crew, along with the sound of a torpedo exploding, and metal twisting. Subsequent to the discovery of the wreck (see below), analysts at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, experts in analyzing modern submarine sounds, studied these recordings and concluded that the &quot;I-52&quot; was sunk by Taylor. The propeller sounds heard by Gordon were actually from &quot;U-530&quot;, nearly away, reaching Gordon&#x27;s sonobuoys through a &quot;surface duct&quot;. This quirk of underwater sound propagation traps sounds in a channel near the surface and can transmit them for many miles. At the time, the Navy credited the sinking of the &quot;I-52&quot; to both Gordon and Taylor, as it was uncertain whether the ship was sunk on the first attack.

===Aftermath===
On 30 August 1944, the Kriegsmarine officially declared &quot;I-52&quot; sunk in the Bay of Biscay as of 25 July 1944, with all 95 crew, 14 passengers, and three German personnel. The Imperial Japanese Navy declared &quot;I-52&quot; missing on 2 August 1944, and struck her from service on 10 December 1944 as sunk.

==Recent salvage operations==
In late 1994, a salvage operation named Project Orca was launched to try to locate the &quot;I-52&quot; and retrieve her valuable cargo of gold. Despite the commissioning of the Russian research ship &quot;Akademik Keldysh&quot; for the project and an extensive search, by March 1995 the search had proved to be a failure (Hamilton-Paterson 1998). Very shortly afterwards, however, in the spring of 1995, Paul Tidwell, working with the ocean exploration company Meridian Sciences, Inc. (later renamed Nauticos Corp.) located the wreck deep, mostly upright. The vessel was found nearly from the datum quoted by the U.S. Navy at the time of the sinking, but within of the coordinates computed by Meridian. Meridian&#x27;s analysts used historical ship logs from the U.S. task force as well as from the German U-boat to reconstruct the events of the battle and correct navigation errors using a process called &quot;re-navigation,&quot; or RENAV. Her conning tower is intact and her hull number is still visible. The bow is broken up, probably due to impact on the bottom, and a large hole, probably caused by one of the torpedoes, is aft of the conning tower. Debris was scattered over a large area. Plans were made to raise the sub and recover the gold. The Japanese government objected, indicating that they considered the wreck site a grave. Tidwell worked on the proper procedures with the Japanese government and received the approval of the war graves authorities in Japan. Tidwell&#x27;s team took down a Japanese naval ensign and affixed it to the wrecked submarine. A metal box from the debris field was brought to the surface in the hope that it would contain some of the sunken gold (worth US$25 million at that time – US$109,085,000 in 2020), but when opened, the salvors were disappointed to find not gold, but opium. It was dumped overboard.

The plan was to recover the entire conning tower, diplomatic pouches, gold, coding equipment, (Japanese and German) and more. The recovered items would be taken to New Orleans for cleaning, conservation, and corrosion treatment to prepare for an exhibition. Mandalay Bay Casino had offered $20 million for the exhibition. After three years in Las Vegas everything except the gold would be returned to Japan to be placed at the city of Kure in a permanent exhibition.

There are no full-size Japanese World War II submarines on display anywhere in the world; however, captured Japanese midget submarines are on display at the Admiral Nimitz Museum in Fredericksburg, Texas, at the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum &amp; Park, close to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.

&quot;The Japan Times&quot; reported that Tidwell intended to return to the site and raise the submarine in November 2005 or May 2006. However, as of March 2021, Tidwell&#x27;s plans have not been fulfilled.

==Media coverage==
* In 2000 the National Geographic Society commissioned and produced a documentary called, &quot;Submarine I-52: Search for WWII Gold&quot;, on the &quot;I-52&quot; and Tidwell&#x27;s salvage effort.
* The October 1999 issue of the &quot;National Geographic&quot; featured an article on the &quot;I-52&quot; sinking and salvage.

<doc id="194743" wikidata="Q1411166" url="?curid=194743" title="Orthonormality">
<text>In linear algebra, two vectors in an inner product space are orthonormal if they are orthogonal unit vectors. A unit vector means that the vector has a length of 1, which is also known as normalized. Orthogonal means that the vectors are all perpendicular to each other. A set of vectors form an orthonormal set if all vectors in the set are mutually orthogonal and all of unit length. An orthonormal set which forms a basis is called an &quot;orthonormal basis&quot;.

== Intuitive overview ==
The construction of orthogonality of vectors is motivated by a desire to extend the intuitive notion of perpendicular vectors to higher-dimensional spaces. In the Cartesian plane, two vectors are said to be &quot;perpendicular&quot; if the angle between them is 90° (i.e. if they form a right angle). This definition can be formalized in Cartesian space by defining the dot product and specifying that two vectors in the plane are orthogonal if their dot product is zero.

Similarly, the construction of the norm of a vector is motivated by a desire to extend the intuitive notion of the length of a vector to higher-dimensional spaces. In Cartesian space, the &quot;norm&quot; of a vector is the square root of the vector dotted with itself. That is,
:formula_1

Many important results in linear algebra deal with collections of two or more orthogonal vectors. But often, it is easier to deal with vectors of unit length. That is, it often simplifies things to only consider vectors whose norm equals 1. The notion of restricting orthogonal pairs of vectors to only those of unit length is important enough to be given a special name. Two vectors which are orthogonal and of length 1 are said to be &quot;orthonormal&quot;.

=== Simple example ===
What does a pair of orthonormal vectors in 2-D Euclidean space look like?

Let u = (x1, y1) and v = (x2, y2).
Consider the restrictions on x1, x2, y1, y2 required to make u and v form an orthonormal pair.

* From the orthogonality restriction, u • v = 0.
* From the unit length restriction on u, ||u|| = 1.
* From the unit length restriction on v, ||v|| = 1.

Expanding these terms gives 3 equations:
#formula_2
#formula_3
forms an orthonormal set.

However, this is of little consequence, because C[−π,π] is infinite-dimensional, and a finite set of vectors cannot span it. But, removing the restriction that &quot;n&quot; be finite makes the set dense in C[−π,π] and therefore an orthonormal basis of C[−π,π].

<doc id="194744" wikidata="Q8054747" url="?curid=194744" title="Yolanda Vadiz">
<text>Yolanda Vadiz (February 14, 1959 – December 8, 1987) was a Puerto Rican soprano. She obtained her Bachelor of Arts in Puerto Rico and her master&#x27;s from the Manhattan School of Music and Juilliard School in New York. While in New York, she sang the lead role in the zarzuela &quot;Doña Francisquita&quot; for the Repertorio Español theater company located at the Gramercy Arts Theater, Off-Broadway. As the winner of the Rome Festival in Italy, she played the role of Susanna in Le Nozze di Figaro. While in Italy, she was hired by RAI Television Network, and sang in front of kings and high dignitaries from different countries.

==Musical life==
While still in the music conservatory, Vádiz was a finalist at the Metropolitan Opera House Eastern Region Auditions, and did concerts with the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra along with bass Justino Diaz, and singers Ruth Fernandez, Chucho Avellanet and Nydia Caro.

Vadiz was the daughter of Puerto Rican actress and show host Meche Marchand, and of Puerto Rican trio singer Jose Luis Vadiz Colon (known as Guito Vádiz). When Meche married the comedy actor and television host Luis Antonio Cosme. , before she was 15 years old, she was left in their custody. Cosme, seeing Yolanda&#x27;s talent for singing, wanted to enroll her in the Escuela Libre de Música to begin her art studies.

Vádiz released her only album, Amor en Mil Idiomas, in 1986, produced by her mother and performed by Pedro Rivera Toledo. The song that gave the album its name became an instant hit, not only on gospel radio stations, in and outside Puerto Rico, but also on mainstream music stations.

==Personal life and death==
Vádiz married Italian lawyer Vittoriano Iucci in 1986, and they moved to Rome. Upon their return to Italy, after promoting their new album in Puerto Rico, the couple suffered carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a defective gas heater in the apartment they were just moving into. Yolanda had turned on the gas heater after closing all the windows in the apartment. Her husband died immediately in his sleep. Vádiz fell into a coma and was transferred to a hospital in Rome. Her mother flew up to be by her side. The news of her critical condition and the death of her husband crossed the island of Puerto Rico immediately, and all the media transmitted bulletins of her state of health to the people of Puerto Rico.

Upon hearing the news, Cosme, helped by his television audience, rented a hospital plane so that Yolanda, still in a coma, could be transferred to her homeland, attended by doctors and nurses at her side. She arrived in Puerto Rico from Rome, still unconscious. Her mother flew separately on a commercial airline to be at the airport when her daughter landed. Yolanda&#x27;s arrival at midnight was an event seen by many passers-by stopped on the streets and sidewalks of Isla Verde, and many others from their balconies as ambulances and their sirens passed by. The battery of doctors waiting for her at the entrance to the Regional Hospital was spectacular. However, despite efforts to save Yolanda, she died three days later.

In 1988, Cosme remarried, and he and his new wife had a daughter, whom they named Yolanda, to honor Vádiz&#x27;s memory.

Some time later, her mother edited her music and released it on CD, including a video for her hit song &quot;Amor en Mil Idiomas&quot;, which can still be found in major music stores and on the Internet through cdbaby. com.

Yolanda Vadiz died on December 8, 1987, and was buried at Cementerio La Piedad in Ponce, Puerto Rico.

<text>Tiki Data was a manufacturer of microcomputers, located in Oslo, Norway. The company was founded in 1983 by Lars Monrad Krohn and Gro Jørgensen, and was targeting the then emerging computer market in the educational sector. Following the launch of the Tiki 100 computer, which was designed by Tiki Data from the bottom up, the company started publishing software for the educational sector. Following the impact of the IBM PC, the company switched to selling rebranded PC-compatible computers.

Tiki Data was bought by Merkantildata in 1996, and ceased to exist from that point on.

<doc id="194750" wikidata="Q211377" url="?curid=194750" title="Leyte">
<text>Leyte ( ) is an island in the Visayas group of islands in the Philippines. It is eighth-largest and sixth-most populous island in the Philippines, with a total population of 2,626,970 as of 2020 census.

Since the accessibility of land has been depleted, Leyte has provided countless number of migrants to Mindanao.
Most inhabitants are farmers. Fishing is a supplementary activity. Rice and corn (maize) are the main food crops; cash crops include coconuts, abaca, tobacco, bananas, and sugarcane. There are some manganese deposits, and sandstone and limestone are quarried in the northwest.

Politically, the island is divided into two provinces: (Northern) Leyte and Southern Leyte. Territorially, Southern Leyte includes the island of Panaon to its south. To the north of Leyte is the island province of Biliran, a former sub-province of Leyte.

The major cities of Leyte are Tacloban, on the eastern shore at the northwest corner of Leyte Gulf, and Ormoc, on the west coast.

Leyte today is notable for the geothermal electric power plants near Ormoc.

== History ==

=== Pre-colonial period ===
The island was known to 16th-century Spanish explorers as Tandaya. Its population grew rapidly after 1900, especially in the Leyte and Ormoc valleys. The island was once the location of &quot;Mairete&quot;, a historic community which was ruled by Datu Ete. Before being colonized by Spain, the island was once home to indigenous animist Warays to the east and other indigenous animist Visayan groups to the west. In the early 17th Century Father Ignacio Alcina, recorded a local epic that a certain Datung Sumanga of Leyte courted the princess, Bugbung Humasanum of Bohol by raiding Imperial China, and upon their marriage, they were the precursors of a kingdom there.

===Colonial period ===
Leyte was once labeled as &quot;Ceylon&quot; in early Spanish maps of the Philippines and in the 1700s, was home to 38 Spanish Filipino families and 7,678 native families.

=== World War II ===
Leyte is most famous for its role in the reconquest of the Philippines in World War II. The province was utilized by the Japanese as a hub for sexual slavery. Some sex slave sites included Tacloban and Burauen, where the Japanese kidnapped girls, teenagers, and young adults and forced them into becoming sex slaves under the brutal &quot;comfort women&quot; system. On 20 October 1944, General Douglas MacArthur waded ashore on Leyte, saying, &quot;I have returned&quot;, but the Japanese continued to resist strongly in the Battle of Leyte. The convergence of naval forces resulted in the four-day Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle in history. During World War II the island was part of a large US Navy base Leyte-Samar Naval Base.

==Geography==
The island measures about north-south and about at its widest point. In the north it nearly joins the island of Samar, separated by the San Juanico Strait, which becomes as narrow as in some places. The island province of Biliran is also to the north of Leyte and is joined to Leyte island by a bridge across the narrow Biliran Strait. To the south, Leyte is separated from Mindanao by the Surigao Strait. To the east, Leyte is somewhat &quot;set back&quot; from the Philippine Sea of the Pacific Ocean, Samar to the northeast and the Dinagat Islands to the southeast forming Leyte Gulf. To the west is the Camotes Sea.

Leyte is mostly heavily forested and mountainous, but the Leyte Valley in the northeast has much agriculture.

== Historical and other famous sites ==

The Leyte provincial capitol is the seat of the provincial government where there is a mural depicting the First Mass in the Philippines, believed to have happened in Limasawa, and the landing of General Douglas MacArthur.

The MacArthur Landing Memorial National Park in Red Beach, Palo, marks the 1944 landing by the American liberation forces. It also has a lagoon where a life-sized statue of Gen. MacArthur stands.

Mahagnao Volcano Natural Park Located in Burauen, Leyte, about from Tacloban City, the Mahagnao Volcano Natural Park attracts visitors with its lakes, craters, hot springs, multi-colored mud, virgin forests and lagoon. It was proclaimed as a national park in 1937. Like other regions in the Philippines, the area enjoys a temperate climate. It has an elevation of 1,200 meters above sea level and an area of 635 hectares, within the boundaries of Burauen, La Paz and McArthur towns.

Lake Danao is a guitar-shaped lake hemmed by the cloud-capped &quot;Anonang-Lobi&quot; mountain ranges.

Kalanggaman Island in Palompon, Leyte is a virgin island with pure white sand. The ecological atmosphere of the island had been preserved by the municipality.

The Sto. Nino Shrine and Heritage Museum boasts the painting of the fourteen stations of the cross done by Filipino artists and a bas-relief of the legend of the first Filipino man and woman (&quot;Malakas&quot; and &quot;Maganda&quot;).

The San Juanico Bridge is the longest bridge in the Philippines.

Leyte Island is the birthplace of the Tinikling dance, popular throughout the Philippines.

On Friday, 8 November 2013, Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) destroyed 70-80% of the structures in its path on Leyte province. An estimated 10,000 people died and up to 620,000 people were displaced across the region.

Leyte was affected by Tropical Storm Megi (2022).

== Infrastructure ==
=== Flood control ===
Leyte Tide Embankment Project was conceptualized as part of the program on rehabilitation from the aftermath of the strongest typhoon, to build safer cities/communities. The flood control shall cover a length of about 27.3 kilometers stretching from the shoreline of Barangay Diit, Tacloban City passing through the entire shoreline of the Municipality of Palo, Leyte and ending up to Barangay Ambao of Tanauan, Leyte.

==In popular culture==

The 1959 Japanese film &quot;Nobi&quot; (&quot;Fires on the Plain&quot;), though filmed in Japan, is set in Leyte in 1945.

The film was remade in 2014 under the same name; this version was filmed in the Philippines.

<doc id="194751" wikidata="Q4835084" url="?curid=194751" title="BBV Productions">
<text>BBV Productions is a UK-based video and audio production company founded in 1991, specialising in science fiction drama. The company has expanded to include publishing of novels and scripts associated with its productions.

==Origin==
Company co-founder Bill Baggs is a longtime fan of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and BBV productions often involve characters or actors from that series. It was originally founded as Bill &amp; Ben Video. The &quot;Ben&quot; in the company name is the nickname of Bill Baggs&#x27;s wife and fellow company co-founder, Helen. Marian Baggs, the mother of Bill Baggs, also operated a second distribution chain on behalf of BBV.

==Video==
BBV&#x27;s first production was &quot;Summoned by Shadows&quot; (1991), co-produced with the BBC Film Club. Partly as a homage to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which Baggs was a fan of, and partly in a pragmatic attempt to take advantage of a pre-existing audience, &quot;Summoned by Shadows&quot; was a &quot;Who&quot;-style tale of strange doings on a distant planet starring Colin Baker as the nameless protagonist (listed in the credits as &quot;The Stranger&quot;). Nicola Bryant co-starred as &quot;Miss Brown&quot;. The adventures of The Stranger ran to six videos (and two audio dramas, the second remade as the sixth video). (For more information, see The Stranger (video series).)

BBV&#x27;s next effort was &quot;The AirZone Solution?&quot;, an ecologically themed thriller about a near-future conspiracy. Released in 1993, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary year, it involved four out of five surviving ex-Doctors. Baker and Bryant starred. Successor Sylvester McCoy and predecessors Peter Davison and Jon Pertwee also appeared as members of a small group joined against a sinister conspiracy.

&quot;The Zero Imperative&quot; (1994) marked a new departure for BBV. Although stuffed to the gills with ex-&quot;Doctor Who&quot; guest stars, only one of them was actually playing the same character: the story was built around Caroline John&#x27;s Liz Shaw, the Doctor&#x27;s companion in the seventh season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, now depicted as an investigator for PROBE (the &quot;Preternatural Research Bureau&quot;). The PROBE series ran for an additional three stories; all four were written by Mark Gatiss, who found more widespread fame as a member of the League of Gentlemen, later going on to write episodes for the revived series. The potentially-confusing mixture of Caroline John reprising her &quot;Doctor Who&quot; role with other recognisable &quot;Who&quot; stars playing different characters worked against the series, as did the way that Liz Shaw often seemed to be herself a different character from the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; original. (The latter problem may have been exacerbated by the fact that, although BBV had obtained permission to use Liz Shaw, they had no rights relating to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; itself - which meant that no explicit reference could be made to any other aspect of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, including the events of the stories in which Liz had appeared.)

BBV&#x27;s next series was a spin-off from two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories in the 1970s in which the Doctor assisted the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce (UNIT) in defeating the Autons, robotic invaders sent to conquer Earth on behalf of the alien Nestenes. The trilogy, beginning with &quot;Auton&quot; in 1997, recounted UNIT&#x27;s battle against another Auton invasion, this time without the Doctor&#x27;s aid (since BBV had obtained permission to use UNIT and the Autons, but was never given permission to use the Doctor himself). &quot;Auton&quot; was also the first BBV production to have no &quot;Doctor Who&quot; guest stars at all, after Nicholas Courtney (who was to reprise his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; role as UNIT commander Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart) had to withdraw from the project, due to ill health. With Courtney out, the focus of the series was the original character of Lockwood, an enigmatic UNIT agent played by Michael Wade.

After the success of the Auton trilogy, BBV produced &quot;Cyberon&quot; (involving a race of alien cyborgs reminiscent of the Cybermen). 2001&#x27;s &quot;Do you Have a Licence to Save this Planet?&quot; was a comedy starring Sylvester McCoy as the chiropodist. This spoof not only referenced previous BBV productions- but also &quot;Doctor Who&quot; itself.

BBV&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (previously titled &quot;Zygon: When Being Me Is Not Enough&quot;). In which Mike Kirkwood dreams of being a monster, unaware that he is in fact a Zygon, believing himself to be human. This story also includes Jo Castleton&#x27;s character of Doctor Lauren Anderson from &quot;Cyberon&quot;.

A new PROBE film was released 15 April 2015 with Hazel Burrows taking over from Caroline John as Liz Shaw.

== Audio ==
After a few earlier experiments, BBV began regularly releasing audio dramas on CD in 1998, under the umbrella title &quot;Audio Adventures in Time &amp; Space&quot;. The mainstay of the CD line to begin with was a series starring Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred (the Doctor/companion team from the 1987, 1988 and 1989 seasons of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) as a pair of wanderers in time and space named &quot;The Professor&quot; (McCoy) and &quot;Ace&quot; (Aldred) who so closely resembled the characters McCoy and Aldred had played on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; - even addressing each other by the same nicknames - that the BBC stepped in and their seventh outing, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, consequently introduced a number of changes to the characters that made the resemblance somewhat less close, the main one being that the protagonists were now called &quot;The Dominie&quot; (McCoy) and &quot;Alice&quot; (Aldred).

The first of the &quot;Audio Adventures in Time &amp; Space&quot; not to include the McCoy/Aldred double act was &quot;Cyber-Hunt&quot;, the first BBV production about the Cyberons. A further &quot;Who&quot;-ish note was added by the introduction of an amnesic space traveler played by Nicholas Briggs, who some years earlier had played the Doctor in the Audio Visuals series of unlicensed fan audios. (He was dubbed &quot;Fred&quot; by one of the other characters after her pet goldfish).

BBV moved away from characters-who-might-be-the-Doctor (a field that, in any case, lost some of its appeal for fan audiences once Big Finish Productions began producing officially licensed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas with the original actors reprising their incarnation of the character) and, following the success of the Auton trilogy, focussed more on stand-alone dramas about various &quot;Doctor Who&quot; alien races, licensed directly from the writers who created them. For some of those writers, the BBV audios have offered a chance to revisit their creations: for instance, the range includes a story by Pip and Jane Baker explaining what happened to the Rani (last seen in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; being abducted by a group of aliens that were also created by the writing pair), and a series of stories by Lawrence Miles about his history-spanning terrorist organisation Faction Paradox.

In 2002, BBV announced that they would not produce any more audio CDs, but would instead concentrate on their new DVD releases.

In 2022 BBV announced physical collections of their audios would be produced.

<text>Kaypro Corporation was an American home and personal computer manufacturer based in Solana Beach in the 1980s. The company was founded by Non-Linear Systems (NLS) to compete with the popular Osborne 1 portable microcomputer. Kaypro produced a line of rugged, &quot;luggable&quot; CP/M-based computers sold with an extensive software bundle which supplanted its competitors and quickly became one of the top-selling personal computer lines of the early 1980s.

Kaypro was exceptionally loyal to its original customer base but slow to adapt to the changing computer market and the advent of IBM PC compatible technology. It faded from the mainstream before the end of the decade and was eventually forced into bankruptcy in 1992.

==History==
Kaypro began as Non-Linear Systems (NLS), a maker of electronic test equipment, founded in 1952 by Andrew Kay, the inventor of the digital voltmeter.

In the 1970s, NLS was an early adopter of microprocessor technology, which enhanced the flexibility of products such as production-line test sets. In 1981, Non-Linear Systems began designing a personal computer, called &quot;KayComp&quot;, that would compete with the popular Osborne 1 transportable microcomputer. In 1982, Non-Linear Systems organized a daughter company named the Kaypro Corporation.
Despite being the first model to be released commercially, the original system was branded as the &quot;Kaypro II&quot; (at a time when one of the most popular microcomputers was the Apple II). The Kaypro II was designed to be portable like the Osborne, contained in a single enclosure with a handle for carrying. Set in an aluminum case, with a keyboard that snapped onto the front, covering the 9&quot; CRT display and drives, it weighed and was equipped with a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, 64 kilobytes of RAM, and two 5¼-inch double-density single-sided floppy disk drives. It ran Digital Research, Inc.&#x27;s CP/M operating system, the industry standard for 8-bit computers with 8080 or Z80 CPUs, and sold for about .

The company advertised the Kaypro II as &quot;the computer that sells for &quot;. Although some of the press mocked its design—one magazine described Kaypro as &quot;producing computers packaged in tin cans&quot;—others raved about its value, noting that the included software bundle had a retail value over by itself, and by mid-1983 the company was selling more than 10,000 units a month, briefly making it the fifth-largest computer maker in the world.

The Kaypro II was part of a new generation of consumer-friendly personal computers that were designed to appeal to novice users who wanted to perform basic productivity on a machine that was relatively easy to set up and use. It managed to correct most of the Osborne 1&#x27;s deficiencies: the screen was larger and showed more characters at once, the floppy drives stored over twice as much data, and it was better-built and more reliable.

Computers such as the Kaypro II were widely referred to as &quot;appliance&quot; or &quot;turnkey&quot; machines; they offered little in the way of expandability or features that would interest hackers or electronics hobbyists and were mainly characterized by their affordable price and a collection of bundled software. While it was easy to obtain and use new software with the Kaypro II—there were thousands of application programs available for CP/M, and every Kaypro 8-bit computer had a full 64 KB of RAM, enough to run virtually any CP/M program—the hardware expandability of this computer was nearly nonexistent. The Kaypro II had no expansion slots or system bus connector, no spare ROM socket, no peripheral bus, only two I/O ports, and an ASCII text-only green-on-black video display, of 80 x 24 characters, that could only be shown on the internal 9&quot; CRT monitor (despite the video being scanned at NTSC TV-compatible rates).

In contrast, one feature that was favorable to electronics hobbyists was that all the chips on the Kaypro II mainboard were installed in sockets, not soldered to the board, making it easy to repair the machines or even to splice custom circuits into the stock logic (temporarily or permanently). Also, while Kaypro machines were generally not upgradeable without factory-unauthorized custom modification, some Kaypro computers that came with single-sided floppy disk drives could be upgraded to double-sided drives, and some that came with only one floppy drive could have a second drive added. (The Kaypro II itself may be upgradeable or not to double-sided drives depending on which of two possible mainboard types is installed in the machine).

Despite their limitations, the boxy units were so popular that they spawned a network of hobbyist user groups across the United States that provided local support for Kaypro products; the company worked with the user groups and would have a salesman drop by if in the area.

Kaypro&#x27;s success contributed to the eventual failure of the Osborne Computer Corporation and Morrow Designs. A more rugged seeming, &quot;industrialized&quot; design than competitors such as the Osborne made the Kaypro popular for commercial/industrial applications. Its RS-232 port was widely used by service technicians for on-site equipment configuration, control and diagnostics. The relatively high quality of mechanical fabrication seen in the aluminum-cased Kaypro 8-bit computers was a natural outgrowth of NLS&#x27;s prior business building professional and industrial electronic test instruments.

The version of CP/M included with the Kaypro could also read the Xerox 810&#x27;s single-sided, single-density 86k floppy format. The Kaypro 8-bit computers used the popular Western Digital FD1793 floppy disk controller; any disk format that the FD1793 could read and/or write (at 250 kbit/s), the Kaypro II, 4, 10, and similar models are capable of reading and/or writing. Theoretically, any soft-sector MFM or FM floppy format that is within the limits of the FD1793 could be read or written if the user wrote their own utility program.

Kaypro published and subsidized &quot;ProFiles: The Magazine for Kaypro Users&quot;, a monthly, 72-page, four-color magazine that went beyond coverage of Kaypro&#x27;s products to include substantive information on CP/M and MS-DOS; frequent contributors included Ted Chiang, David Gerrold, Robert J. Sawyer, and Ted Silveira. Keeping its namesake, the publication profiled Kaypro founder Andrew Kay and software engineer Stephen Buccaci.

Another popular magazine that covered Kaypro computers was &quot;Micro Cornucopia&quot;, published in Bend, Oregon.

Arthur C. Clarke used a Kaypro II to write and collaboratively edit (via modem from Sri Lanka) his 1982 novel &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; and the later film adaptation. A book, &quot;The Odyssey File - The Making of 2010&quot;, was later released about the collaboration.

Following the success of the Kaypro II, Kaypro moved on to produce a long line of similar computers into the mid-1980s. Exceedingly loyal to its original core group of customers, Kaypro continued using the CP/M operating system long after it had been abandoned by its competitors.

In late 1984, Kaypro introduced its first IBM PC compatible, the Kaypro 16 transportable. While admitting that &quot;it&#x27;s what our dealers asked for&quot;, the company stated that it would continue to produce its older computers. This was followed by other PC compatibles: the Kaypro PC, Kaypro 286i (the first 286 IBM PC AT compatible), the Kaypro 386, and the Kaypro 2000 (a rugged aluminum-body battery-powered laptop with a detachable keyboard). The slow start into the IBM clone market would have serious ramifications for the company.

After several turbulent years, with sales dwindling, Kaypro filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 1990. Despite restructuring, the company was unable to recover and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 1992. In 1995, its remaining assets were sold for .

The Kaypro name briefly re-emerged as an online vendor of Microsoft Windows PCs in 1999, but was discontinued in 2001 by its parent company Premio Inc. because of sluggish sales.

==Kaypro computers==

===Hardware===
The Kaypro II has a 2.5 MHz Zilog Z80 microprocessor; 64 KB of RAM; two single-sided 191 KB 5¼-inch floppy disk drives (named A: and B:); and an 80-column, green monochrome, 9&quot; CRT that was praised for its size and clarity (the Osborne 1 had a 5&quot; display).

Early in the Kaypro&#x27;s life, there was a legal dispute with the owner of the Big Board computer, who charged that the Kaypro II main circuit board was an unlicensed copy or clone.

The outer case is constructed of painted aluminum. The computer features a large detachable keyboard unit that covers the screen and disk drives when stowed. The computer could fit into an airline overhead rack. This and other Kaypro computers (except for the Kaypro 2000) run off regular AC mains power and are not equipped with a battery.

The Kaypro IV and later the Kaypro 4 have two double-sided disks. The Kaypro 4 was released in 1984, and was usually referred to as &quot;Kaypro 4 &#x27;84&quot;, as opposed to the Kaypro IV, released one year earlier and referred to as &quot;Kaypro IV &#x27;83&quot;. The Kaypro IV uses different screen addresses than the Kaypro II, meaning software has to be specific to the model.

The Kaypro 10 followed the Kaypro II, and is much like the Kaypro II and Kaypro 4, with the addition of a 10 megabyte hard drive (dually partitioned A: and B:) and replacing one of the two floppy drives (the remaining drive being addressed as C:). The Kaypro 10 also eliminated the complicated procedures to turn the computer on and off often associated with hard disk technology.

Kaypro later replaced their CP/M machines with the MS-DOS-based Kaypro 16, Kaypro PC and others, as the IBM PC and its clones gained popularity. Kaypro was late to the market, however, and never gained the kind of prominence in the MS-DOS arena that it had enjoyed with CP/M. Instead, Kaypro watched as a new company—Compaq—grabbed its market with the Compaq Portable, an all-in-one portable computer that was similar to Kaypro&#x27;s own CP/M portables with the exception of running MS-DOS with near 100% IBM PC compatibility. The Compaq was larger and less durable—whereas the Kaypro had a heavy-gauge aluminium case, the Compaq case was plastic, with a thin-gauge aluminum inner shield to reduce radio frequency interference—but rapidly took over the portable PC market segment.

The 1985 introductions of the Kaypro 286i, the first IBM PC AT clone, and the Kaypro 2000, one of the first laptop computers (an MS-DOS system with monochrome LCD and durable aluminum case), did little to change Kaypro&#x27;s fortunes. Kaypro&#x27;s failure in the MS-DOS market and other corporate issues helped lead to the company&#x27;s eventual downfall.

===Software===
CP/M was the standard operating system for the first generation of Kaypros. The first application software that came with the Kaypro II included a highly unpopular word processor called &quot;Select&quot; that was quickly dropped in favor of a proto office suite from Perfect Software which included Perfect Writer, Perfect Calc, Perfect Filer, and Perfect Speller, as well as Kaypro&#x27;s own S-BASIC compiler (which produced executable codice_1 files). Perfect Filer featured non-relational, flat-file databases suitable for merging a contact list with form letters created in Perfect Writer.

Perfect Writer was initially a rebranded version of the MINCE and Scribble software packages from Mark of the Unicorn, which are CP/M implementations of Emacs and Scribe, ported from their original minicomputer-based versions using BDS C. Later, MBasic (a variant of Microsoft BASIC) and The Word Plus spellchecker were added to the model II suite of software. Word Plus included a set of utilities that could help solve crossword puzzles or anagrams, insert soft hyphens, alphabetize word lists, and compute word frequencies. Another utility program called Uniform allowed the Kaypro to read disks formatted by Osborne, Xerox, or TRS-80 computers.

The initial bundled applications were soon replaced by the well-known titles WordStar, a word processor, with MailMerge, originally a third-party accessory, for personalised mass mailings (form letters), the SuperCalc spreadsheet, two versions of the Microsoft BASIC interpreter, Kaypro&#x27;s S-BASIC, a bytecode-compiled BASIC called C-Basic, and the dBase II relational database system.

Data could be moved between these programs relatively easily by using comma-delimited format files (now more commonly known as CSV files), which enhanced the utility of the package. The manuals assumed no computer background, the programs were straightforward to use, and thus it was possible to find the CEO of a small company developing the applications needed in-house.

The Kaypro II and later models also came with some games, including versions of old character-based games such as &quot;Star Trek&quot;; a few were arcade games re-imagined in ASCII, including &quot;CatChum&quot; (a Pac-Man-like game), &quot;Aliens&quot; (a &quot;Space Invaders&quot;-like game) and &quot;Ladder&quot; (a &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;-like game).

If bought separately, this software would have cost more than the entire hardware and software package together. The Kaypro II was a very usable and (at the time) powerful computer for home or office, even though the painted metal case made it look more like a rugged laboratory instrument than an office machine. It enjoyed a reputation for durability.

Later Kaypro CP/M models came with even more software. In 1984, &quot;BYTE&quot; magazine observed &quot;Kaypro apparently has tremendous buying and bargaining power,&quot; noting the Kaypro 10 came with both WordStar and Perfect Writer, plus &quot;two spelling checkers, two spreadsheets, two communications programs and three versions of BASIC&quot;.

Later MS-DOS Kaypro computers offered a similar software bundle.

==Reception==
&quot;InfoWorld&quot; in 1982 described Kaypro II as &quot;a rugged, functional and practical computer system marketed at a reasonable price.&quot; The reviewer called the hardware &quot;first-rate,&quot; writing that he had used the computer indoors and outdoors in several countries without fault, and praising the keyboard and screen. Deficiencies included the heavy weight and mediocre documentation.

Jerry Pournelle wrote in &quot;BYTE&quot; in 1983 that he was able to use a Kaypro II without the documentation. Although he preferred the much more expensive Otrona Attaché, Pournelle called the Kaypro&#x27;s hardware &quot;impressive&quot; and &quot;rugged,&quot; approving of the keyboard layout and &quot;certainly the largest screen you&#x27;ll ever get in a portable machine.&quot; A later review by the magazine described the computer as &quot;best value,&quot; citing the rugged hardware design, sharp display, keyboard, documentation, and the extensive bundled software. In 1984 Pournelle stated that &quot;For those without much money, there&#x27;s no real choice ... you need a Kaypro, which has become both the VW and Chevrolet of the micro industry&quot;.

&quot;BYTE&quot; stated in 1984 that while the Kaypro 10 was &quot;not a technologically innovative machine ... the equipment and power delivered for the price are outstanding&quot;, noting that the computer &quot;costs less than many stand-alone hard-disk drives&quot;. It approved of the &quot;beautiful&quot; monitor as an improvement from the Kaypro II&#x27;s, and the extensive menus for running software on the hard drive without using the command line. The magazine criticized the &quot;unacceptable&quot; user&#x27;s guide, and predicted that the large software bundle would be &quot;stupefying&quot; to novice users, but concluded that the computer was an &quot;exceptional value for the money. It should be considered by anyone interested in hard-disk capacity or performance at an excellent price.&quot;

&quot;Creative Computing&quot; in December 1984 chose the Kaypro 2 as the best transportable computer under , praising the &quot;incredible array of software&quot; included for &quot;an astounding &quot; price.

==Kaypro by model and year==
Kaypro&#x27;s nomenclature was odd, with the numerical designations for their machines having more to do with the capacity of the drives than the order they were produced. Kaypro also released several different models with the same names, perhaps hoping to capitalize on the name recognition of their older machines. As a result, identifying exactly which model a Kaypro is often requires an inspection of their hardware configuration.

All of the computers listed below are of the portable type unless otherwise noted.
* 1982
**&quot;Kaycomp II&quot;: The first Kaypro was a demonstrator model shown mainly to prospective dealers. It had the same case as future models, but was painted green, with two single sided floppy drives that were mounted vertically on opposite sides of the monitor like the Osborne 1, its intended competition, and a 9-inch internal monitor instead of the Osborne&#x27;s 5-inch display. 
**&quot;Kaypro II&quot;: The first commercially released Kaypro was an immediate success, dominating its competition, the Osborne 1 microcomputer. Originally marketed as Kaycomp II, the floppy drives were now mounted horizontally to the right of the screen.

* 1983
**&quot;Kaypro IV&quot;: An evolution of the Kaypro II, the Kaypro IV had two DS/DD drives (390 KB) and came with WordStar in addition to the Perfect Suite of software.
**&quot;Kaypro 10&quot;: The Kaypro 10 was one of the earliest computers to come standard with a hard drive. It came with a 10-megabyte internal hard drive and a single DS/DD floppy drive.
* 1984
**&quot;Kaypro 4&quot;: The Kaypro 4 was virtually identical to the IV, but featured half-height drives instead of full-height drives, a 4 MHz clock speed and had basic graphics capabilities. It also had an internal 300-baud modem.
**&quot;Kaypro 2X&quot;: The Kaypro 2X was similar to the Kaypro 4, but it lacked the built-in 300-baud modem that was available in the Kaypro 4. Kaypro 2X&#x27;s were often sold in a bundle with the WordStar word processing software suite, spreadsheet and database software. The impact printer that was also included in the bundle was labeled as the &quot;Kaypro Printer,&quot; but was actually a re-branded Juki 6100 daisywheel printer.
**&quot;Kaypro Robie&quot;: The Kaypro Robie was the only CP/M based Kaypro to be non-portable. Designed as a desktop computer, it had the same motherboard as the Kaypro 4. It was also equipped with two 2.6 MB high-density floppy drives and a 300-baud modem. The floppy drives were notorious for destroying disks as they literally scraped the media off of the disk substrate. The Robie was jet black, with the drives mounted above the screen, and the front panel angled upward. The Robie did not sell well, but it did make periodic cameo appearances on the ABC television series &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, as the desktop computer used by Bruce Willis&#x27;s character David Addison. Due to its black color, the fact that it sat upright and looked like a helmet, and its handle mounted on the top, it was nicknamed &quot;Darth Vader&#x27;s lunchbox&quot;.
* 1985
**&quot;Kaypro &quot;New&quot; 2&quot;: A scaled-down Kaypro 2X for the budget buyer, came with minimal software, and did not feature the internal modem.
**&quot;Kaypro 4+88&quot;: A dual system computer, the 4+88 was equipped with both an 8088 processor and a Z80, and was capable of running both the MS-DOS and CP/M operating systems. It came with 256 KB of RAM for the MS-DOS operating system that could double as a RAM disk for CP/M.
**&quot;Kaypro 16&quot;: Very similar in appearance to the Kaypro 10, the Kaypro 16&#x27;s main difference was that it had an 8088 processor and 256 KB of RAM and ran on the MS-DOS operating system instead of CP/M. The Kaypro 16/2e was a &quot;Bundle&quot; for a college computer. It came with DOS 3.3, two 5.25&quot; 360 KB floppy drives and 768 KB RAM and bundled software to complete the college course.
**&quot;Kaypro 2000&quot;: Kaypro&#x27;s first and only laptop, it was an MS-DOS machine that ran on heavy lead-acid batteries—the same battery technology used in automobile batteries. Similar in basic appearance to a modern laptop, it featured a detachable keyboard, rugged brushed aluminum casing and a pop-up 3.5-inch floppy drive. In what seems to have been a recurring comparison, it has been called &quot;Darth Vader&#x27;s laptop&quot;.
**&quot;Kaypro PC&quot;: Late to the PC market, the Kaypro PC was intended as a competitor to the IBM PC-XT desktop machine. Running at a faster clock speed than IBM&#x27;s machine, it was available with a larger hard drive than that offered by IBM and an extensive software package. It featured the CPU on a daughterboard on a backplane, which, like the Zenith Data Systems&#x27; Z-DOS machines, promised upgradability.

**&quot;Kaypro 286i&quot;: A 6 MHz 286 desktop, it was the first IBM PC/AT compatible, with dual 1.2 MB floppy drives standard and an extensive software package but no MS-DOS 3.0, which had not yet been released, requiring the user to purchase PC DOS 3.0 from IBM.
* 1986

**&quot;Kaypro 1&quot;: The Kaypro 1 was the last CP/M model Kaypro introduced. In most ways, it was simply a Kaypro 2X with a smaller software package. It is distinctive from earlier Kaypro models because of its vertically oriented disk drives (although some Kaypro 10 models also had them).
* 1987
**&quot;Kaypro 386&quot;: A 20 MHz 386 desktop, with an extensive software package. It featured a CPU on a circuit board that fit onto a backplane, just like the other expansion cards.

<text>OpenType is a format for scalable computer fonts. Derived from TrueType, it retains TrueType&#x27;s basic structure but adds many intricate data structures for describing typographic behavior. OpenType is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation.

The specification germinated at Microsoft, with Adobe Systems also contributing by the time of the public announcement in 1996.

Because of wide availability and typographic flexibility, including provisions for handling the diverse behaviors of all the world&#x27;s writing systems, OpenType fonts are used commonly on major computer platforms.

==History==

OpenType&#x27;s origins date to Microsoft&#x27;s attempt to license Apple&#x27;s advanced typography technology GX Typography in the early 1990s. Those negotiations failed, motivating Microsoft to forge ahead with its own technology, dubbed &quot;TrueType Open&quot; in 1994. Adobe joined Microsoft in those efforts in 1996, adding support for the glyph outline technology used in its Type 1 fonts.

The joint effort intended to supersede both Apple&#x27;s TrueType and Adobe&#x27;s PostScript Type 1 font format, and to create a more expressive system that handles fine typography and the complex behavior of many of the world&#x27;s writing systems. The two companies combined the underlying technologies of both formats and added new extensions intended to address their limitations. The name OpenType was chosen for the joint technology, which they announced later that year.

===Open Font Format===
Adobe and Microsoft continued to develop and refine OpenType over the next decade. Then, in late 2005, OpenType began migrating to an open standard under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) within the MPEG group, which had previously (in 2003) adopted OpenType 1.4 by reference for MPEG-4. Adoption of the new standard reached formal approval in March 2007 as ISO Standard ISO/IEC 14496-22 (MPEG-4 Part 22) called Open Font Format (OFF, not to be confused with Web Open Font Format), sometimes referred to as &quot;Open Font Format Specification&quot; (OFFS). The initial standard was technically equivalent to OpenType 1.4 specification, with appropriate language changes for ISO. The second edition of the OFF was published in 2009 (ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009) and was declared &quot;technically equivalent&quot; to the &quot;OpenType font format specification&quot;. Since then, OFF and OpenType specifications have been maintained in sync. OFF is a free, publicly available standard.

By 2001 hundreds of OpenType fonts were on the market. Adobe finished converting their entire font library to OpenType toward the end of 2002. , around 10,000 OpenType fonts had become available, with the Adobe library comprising about a third of the total. By 2006, every major font foundry and many minor ones were developing fonts in OpenType format.

===Unicode Variation Sequences===
Unicode version 3.2 (published in 2002) introduced variation selectors as an encoding mechanism to represent particular glyph forms for characters. Unicode did not, however, specify how text renderers should support these sequences. In late 2007, variation sequences for the Adobe-Japan1 collection were registered in the Unicode Ideographic Database, leading to a real need for an OpenType solution. This resulted in development of the codice_1 subtable Format 14, which was introduced in OpenType version 1.5.

===Color fonts===
Unicode version 6.0 introduced emoji encoded as characters into Unicode in October 2010. Several companies quickly acted to add support for Unicode emoji in their products. Since Unicode emoji are handled as text, and since color is an essential aspect of the emoji experience, this led to a need to create mechanisms for displaying multicolor glyphs.

Apple, Google and Microsoft independently developed different color-font solutions for use in OS X, iOS, Android and Windows. 

* OpenType and OFF already had support for monochrome bitmap glyph, so Google proposed that OFF be extended to allow for color bitmaps. Apple adopted this approach but declined to participate in extending the ISO standard. As a result, Apple added the codice_2 table to their TrueType format in OS X 10.7, while Google proposed addition of the codice_3 and codice_4 tables to OFF.
* Microsoft adopted a different approach than color bitmaps. Noting existing practice on the Web of layering glyphs of different color on top of one another to create multi-colored elements such as icons, Microsoft proposed a new codice_5 table to map a glyph into a set of glyphs that are layered, and a codice_6 table to define the colors.
* Adobe and Mozilla proposed adding a new codice_7 table that can represent multi-color glyphs using Scalable Vector Graphics.

These proposals were all incorporated into the third edition of OFF (ISO/IEC 14496-22:2015). Microsoft added codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, and codice_7 tables to OpenType version 1.7, and the codice_2 table in OpenType version 1.8. Microsoft implemented support for all of the different color formats in Windows 10 version 1607 (&quot;Anniversary Update&quot;). 

OpenType 1.9 introduced a second version of the codice_5 table that adds additional graphics capabilities. Google originally proposed the enhanced version and jointly developed it with Microsoft. The enhanced graphic capabilities include support for three types of gradients, affine transformations, compositing and blending modes, and custom re-usable components. These enhancements give the codice_5 table all of the graphic capabilities of the codice_7 table except stroking. They also add compositing and blending modes, support for which is considered optional for the codice_7 table (as these are implemented in SVG as filter effects). In addition, the enhancements to the codice_5 table are integrated with OpenType Font Variations, which is not possible with the codice_7 table. The enhanced codice_5 table is supported in the Chromium browser engine as of version 98.

===Collections===

Since at least version 1.4, the OpenType specification had supported &quot;TrueType Collections&quot;, a feature of the format that allows multiple fonts to be stored in a single file. Such a format is useful for distributing an entire typeface (font family) in just one file.

By combining related fonts into a single file, font tables that are identical can be shared, thereby allowing for more efficient storage. Also, individual fonts have a glyph-count limit of 65,535 glyphs, and a Collection file provides a &quot;gap mode&quot; mechanism for overcoming this limit in a single font file. (Each font within the collection still has the 65,535 limit, however.) A TrueType Collection file would typically have a file extension of &quot;.ttc&quot;.

However, the specification only described collection files being used in conjunction with glyphs that are represented as TrueType outlines or as bitmaps. The potential existed to provide the same storage and glyph-count benefits to fonts that use CFF-format glyphs (.otf extension). But the specification did not explicitly allow for that.

In 2014, Adobe announced the creation of OpenType Collections (OTCs), a Collection font file that combines fonts that use CFF-format glyphs. This provided significant storage benefits for CJK fonts that Adobe and Google were jointly developing. For example, the Noto fonts CJK OTC is ~10 MB smaller than the sum of the four separate OTFs of which it is composed. The use of a Collection also allowed for combining a very large number of glyphs into a single file, as would be needed for a pan-CJK font.

Explicit support for Collections with CFF-format glyphs was incorporated into the OpenType specification in version 1.8. To reflect this more-inclusive applicability, the term &quot;OpenType Collection&quot; was adopted, superseding &quot;TrueType Collection&quot;.

=== Font Variations ===

On September 14, 2016, Microsoft announced the release of OpenType version 1.8. This announcement was made together with Adobe, Apple, and Google at the ATypI conference in Warsaw. OpenType version 1.8 introduced &quot;OpenType Font Variations&quot;, which adds mechanisms that allow a single font to support many design variations. Fonts that use these mechanisms are commonly referred to as &quot;Variable fonts&quot;.

OpenType Font Variations re-introduces techniques that were previously developed by Apple in TrueType GX, and by Adobe in Multiple Master fonts. The common idea of these formats is that a single font includes data to describe multiple variations of a glyph outline (sometimes referred to as &quot;masters&quot;), and that at text-display time, the font rasterizer is able to interpolate or &quot;blend&quot; these variations to derive a continuous range of additional outline variations.

The concept of fully parametric fonts had been explored in a more general way by Donald E. Knuth in the METAFONT system, introduced in 1978. That system and its successors were never widely adopted by professional type designers or commercial software systems. TrueType GX and Multiple Master formats, OpenType Font Variations&#x27; direct predecessors, were introduced in the 1990s, but were not widely adopted, either. Adobe later abandoned support for the Multiple Master format. This has led to questions as to whether a re-introduction of similar technology could succeed. By 2016, however, the industry landscape had changed in several respects. In particular, emergence of Web fonts and of mobile devices had created interest in responsive design and in seeking ways to deliver more type variants in a size-efficient format. Also, whereas the 1990s was an era of aggressive competition in font technology, often referred to as &quot;the font wars&quot;, OpenType Font Variations was developed in a collaborative manner involving several major vendors.

Font Variations is integrated into OpenType 1.8 in a comprehensive manner, allowing most previously-existing capabilities to be used in combination with variations. In particular, variations are supported for both TrueType or CFF glyph outlines, for TrueType hinting, and also for the OpenType Layout mechanisms. The only parts of OpenType for which variations are not supported but might potentially be useful are the &#x27;SVG &#x27; table for color glyphs, and the MATH table for layout of mathematical formulas. The &#x27;SVG &#x27; table uses embedded XML documents, and no enhancement for variation of graphic elements within the SVG documents has been proposed. However, enhancement to the COLR table in OpenType 1.9 has provided a vector format for color glyphs with support for variations.

OpenType 1.8 made use of tables originally defined by Apple for TrueType GX (the avar, cvar, fvar and gvar tables). It also introduced several new tables, including a new table for version 2 of the CFF format (CFF2), and other new tables or additions to existing tables to integrate variations into other parts of the font format (the HVAR, MVAR, STAT and VVAR tables; additions to the BASE, GDEF and name tables).

==Description==

OpenType uses the general sfnt structure of a TrueType font, but it adds several smartfont options that enhance the font&#x27;s typographic and language support capabilities.

The glyph outline data in an OpenType font may be in one of two formats: either TrueType format outlines in a &#x27;glyf&#x27; table, or Compact Font Format (CFF) outlines in a &#x27;CFF &#x27; table. (The table name &#x27;CFF &#x27; is four characters long, ending in a space character.) CFF outline data is based on the PostScript language Type 2 font format. However, the OpenType specification (pre-1.8) does not support the use of PostScript outlines in a TrueType Collection font file. After version 1.8, both formats are supported in the renamed &quot;OpenType Collection&quot;.

For many purposes, such as layout, it does not matter what the outline data format is, but for some purposes, such as rasterisation, it is significant. The OpenType standard does not specify the outline data format: rather, it accommodates any of several existing standards. Sometimes terms like &quot;OpenType (PostScript flavor)&quot; (= &quot;Type 1 OpenType&quot;, &quot;OpenType CFF&quot;) or &quot;OpenType (TrueType flavor)&quot; are used to indicate which outline format a particular OpenType font file contains.

OpenType has several distinctive characteristics:
* Accommodates the Unicode character encoding (as well as others), so that it can support any writing script (or multiple scripts at once).
* Accommodates up to 65,536 glyphs.
* Advanced typographic &quot;layout&quot; features which prescribe positioning and replacement of rendered glyphs. Replacement features include ligatures; positioning features include kerning, mark placement, and baseline specification.
* Cross-platform font files, which can be used without modification on Mac OS, Microsoft Windows and Unix/Linux systems.
* If no additional glyphs or extensive typographic features are added, OpenType CFF fonts can be considerably smaller than their Type 1 counterparts.

==OpenType support==

===Basic Roman support===
Virtually all applications and modern operating systems have basic Roman support and work with OpenType fonts just as well as other, older formats. Benefits beyond basic Roman support include extended language support through Unicode, support for complex writing scripts such as Arabic and the Indic languages, and advanced typographic support for Latin script languages such as English.

Windows 3.1 and all subsequent versions of Windows support OpenType TT fonts (.ttf). Windows 2000 and later support OpenType PS fonts (.otf). Adobe Type Manager could add basic Roman support of OpenType PS fonts in Windows 95, 98, or Me.

===Extended language support===
Extended language support via Unicode for both OpenType and TrueType is present in most applications for Microsoft Windows (including Microsoft Office Publisher, most Adobe applications, and Microsoft Office 2003, though not Word 2002), CorelDRAW X3 and newer, and many Mac OS X applications, including Apple&#x27;s own such as TextEdit, Pages and Keynote. It is also widely supported in free operating systems, such as Linux (e.g. in multiplatform applications like AbiWord, Gnumeric, Calligra Suite, Scribus, OpenOffice.org 3.2 and later versions, etc.).

OpenType support for complex written scripts has so far mainly appeared in Microsoft applications in Microsoft Office, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Publisher. Adobe InDesign provides extensive OpenType capability in Japanese but does not directly support Middle Eastern or Indic scripts—though a separate version of InDesign is available that supports Middle Eastern scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew. Undocumented functionality in many Adobe Creative Suite 4 applications, including InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator, enables Middle Eastern, Indic and other languages, but is not officially supported by Adobe, and requires third-party plug-ins to provide a user interface for the features.

===Advanced typography===
Advanced typographic support for Latin script languages first appeared in Adobe applications such as Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. QuarkXPress 6.5 and below were not Unicode compliant. Hence, text in these versions of QuarkXPress that contains anything other than WinANSI or MacRoman characters will not display correctly in an OpenType font (nor in other Unicode font formats, for that matter). However, in QuarkXPress 7, Quark offered support similar to Adobe&#x27;s. Corel&#x27;s CorelDRAW introduced support for OpenType typographic features in version X6. Mellel, a Mac OS X-only word processor from Redlers, claims parity in typographic features with InDesign, but also extends the support to right-to-left scripts; so does the Classical Text Editor, a specialized word processor developed at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

, popular word processors for Microsoft Windows did not support advanced OpenType typography features. Advanced typography features are implemented only in high-end desktop publishing software. The text engine from Windows Presentation Foundation, which is a managed code implementation of OpenType, is the first Microsoft Windows API to expose OpenType features to software developers, supporting both OpenType TrueType, and OpenType CFF (Compact Font Format) fonts. It supports advanced typographic features such as ligatures, old-style numerals, swash variants, fractions, superscript and subscript, small capitalization, glyph substitution, multiple baselines, contextual and stylistic alternate character forms, kerning, line-level justification, ruby characters etc. WPF applications automatically gain support for advanced typography features. OpenType ligatures are accessible in Microsoft Office Word 2010.

Windows 7 introduced DirectWrite, a hardware accelerated native DirectX API for text rendering with support for multi-format text, resolution-independent outline fonts, ClearType, advanced OpenType typography features, full Unicode text, layout and language support and low-level glyph rendering APIs.

On Mac OS X, AAT-supporting applications running on Mac OS X 10.4 and later, including TextEdit and Keynote, get considerable OpenType support. Apple&#x27;s support for OpenType in Mac OS X 10.4 included most advanced typographic features necessary for Latin script languages, such as small caps, old-style figures, and various sorts of ligatures, but it did not yet support contextual alternates, positional forms, nor glyph reordering as handled by Microsoft&#x27;s Uniscribe library on Windows. Thus, Mac OS X 10.4 did not offer support for Arabic or Indic scripts via OpenType (though such scripts are fully supported by existing AAT fonts). Mac OS X 10.5 has improved support for OpenType and supports Arabic OpenType fonts. Gradually, the OpenType typography support has improved on newer Mac OS X versions (e.g., Mac OS X 10.10 can handle much better long contextual glyph substitutions).

Bitstream Panorama, a line layout and text composition engine from Bitstream Inc., provides complete OpenType support for compact and standard Asian fonts, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Thai and over 50 other worldwide languages. The application supports key OpenType tables required for line layout, such as BASE, glyph definition (GDEF), glyph positioning (GPOS), and glyph substitution (GSUB). Panorama also offers complete support for advanced typography features, such as ligatures, swashes, small caps, ornaments, ordinals, superiors, old style, kerning, fractions, etc.

In free software environments such as Linux, OpenType rendering is provided by the FreeType project, included in free implementations of the X Window System such as X.org. Complex text handling is provided either by pango (calling HarfBuzz) or Qt. The XeTeX and LuaTeX systems allow TeX documents to use OpenType fonts, along with most of their typographic features. Linux version of LibreOffice 4.1 and newer supports many OpenType typography features, because it began to use more sophisticated HarfBuzz text shaping library.

==OpenType Feature File==
As a step in the creation of a font, OpenType font properties (other than the outline) can be defined using human-readable text saved in Adobe&#x27;s OpenType Feature File format. OpenType Feature Files typically have a name ending in a codice_21 extension. These files can be compiled into the binary font container (codice_22 or codice_23) using Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType (AFDKO), FontLab, FontForge, Glyphs, DTL OTMaster, RoboFont or FontTools.

==Layout tags==
OpenType Layout tags are 4-byte character strings that identify the scripts, language systems, features and baselines in an OpenType Layout font. Microsoft&#x27;s Layout tag registry establishes conventions for naming and using these tags. OpenType features are created by using the tags in creating feature scripts that describe how characters are to be manipulated to make the desired feature. These feature scripts can be created and incorporated into OpenType fonts by advanced font editors such as FontLab Studio, AsiaFont Studio, and FontForge.

Operating system and application support for layout tags varies widely.

===Script tags===
Script tags identify the scripts (writing systems) represented in an OpenType font. Each tag corresponds to contiguous character code ranges in Unicode. A script tag can consist of 4 or fewer lowercase letters, such as codice_24 for the Arabic alphabet, codice_24 for the Cyrillic script and codice_24 for the Latin alphabet. The codice_27 script tag, added by Microsoft for Cambria Math, has been added to the specification.

===Language system tags===
Language system tags identify the language systems supported in an OpenType font. Examples include codice_28 for Arabic, codice_29 for Spanish, codice_30 for Armenian, etc. In general, the codes are not the same as ISO 639-2 codes.

These tags can be used to select local variants of letters that share a single Unicode code point. For instance, the Serbian and Macedonian Cyrillic alphabet has some language-specific glyphs for certain letters, which are only preferred and are not strictly mandated.

===Feature tags===

A list of OpenType features with expanded descriptions is given
list of typographic features.

===Baseline tags===
Baseline tags have a specific meaning when used in the horizontal writing direction (used in the &#x27;BASE&#x27; table&#x27;s HorizAxis table), vertical writing direction (used in the &#x27;BASE&#x27; table&#x27;s VertAxis table), or both.
=== Math ===
A set of tables that mirrors TeX math font metrics relatively closely was added by Microsoft initially to Cambria Math for supporting their new math editing and rendering engine in Office 2007 and later. This extension was added to the ISO standard (ISO/IEC CD 14496-22 3rd edition) in April 2014. Additional (usage) details are available in the Unicode technical report 25 and technical note 28. Some of the new technical features (not present in TeX), such as &quot;cut-ins&quot; (which allows kerning of subscripts and superscripts relative to their bases) and stretch stacks have been patented by Microsoft. Windows 8 supports OpenType math outside MS Office applications via the RichEdit 8.0 component.

Besides Microsoft products, XeTeX and LuaTeX also have some level of support for these tables; support is more limited in XeTeX because it uses the traditional TeX math rendering engine (thus it cannot fully use some of the new features in OpenType math that extend TeX), while LuaTeX takes a more flexible approach by changing some of the internals of TeX&#x27;s math rendering; in the words of 
Ulrik Vieth (2009): &quot;More precisely, while XeTeX only provides access to the OpenType parameters as additional \fontdimens, LuaTeX uses an internal data structure based on the combined set of OpenType and TeX parameters, making it possible to supply missing values which are not supported in either OpenType math fonts or traditional TeX math fonts.&quot; In 2013, XeTeX also gained support for cut-ins.

The Gecko rendering engine used by the Firefox web browser also supports some OpenType math features in its MathML implementation.

, the set of fonts that supported OpenType math includes: Asana-Math, Cambria Math, 
DejaVu Math TeX Gyre,
Garamond Math,
Latin Modern Math,
Libertinus Math,
Neo Euler,
STIX Math,
XITS Math,
Fira Math,
GFS Neohellenic Math,
and four TeX Gyre fonts Bonum Math, Pagella Math, Schola Math, Termes Math.
 More recently the Latin Modern and TeX Gyre fonts (an &quot;LM-ization&quot; of the standard PostScript fonts) have also gained support for OpenType math. the number of OpenType math fonts is still fairly limited. A more up-to-date list is maintained on Mozilla&#x27;s web site

=== Color ===
Emergence of Unicode emoji created a need for TrueType and OpenType formats to support color glyphs. Apple added a color extension in Mac OS X Lion (and also to iOS 4+). Fonts were extended with colored images within the sbix table. Google used a similar extension with embedded color bitmap images contained within a pair of tables, the CBDT and CBLC tables. The Google version is implemented in FreeType 2.5.

In Windows 8.1 Microsoft also added color support to fonts, first implemented in the Segoe UI Emoji font. Microsoft&#x27;s implementation, however, relies entirely on vector graphics: two new OpenType tables were added in Microsoft&#x27;s implementation: the COLR table allows layered glyphs and the CPAL (&quot;Color Palette&quot;) actually defines the colors for the layers. The multi-layer approach allows a backwards compatible implementation as well as varying the rendering depending on the color context surrounding the glyphs. According to Adam Twardoch: &quot;At TypeCon [2013], Greg Hitchcock clarified the envisioned roles of the palettes: first palette is used by default for &quot;dark on light&quot; color situations while second palette is intended for use in &quot;light on dark&quot; situations. Additional palettes should be selectable by the user.&quot;

Mozilla and Adobe developed a different vector-based extension by adding embedded SVG documents (supporting color but also animations) into the SVG table. The SVG table also allowed for using color palettes defined in the CPAL table. Support was first implemented in Firefox 26.

Adobe, Mozilla, Google and Microsoft each submitted their color extensions for standardization thorough ISO/IEC 14496-22. The new tables for each of these were then added into OpenType version 1.7. Apple&#x27;s sbix table was originally supported only in AAT fonts, but it was later added into OpenType version 1.8. Microsoft Windows 10 Anniversary Update was the first OS to support all four color font extensions, and Microsoft Edge was the first browser to do so.

In OpenType Version 1.8.3, the specification for the SVG table was revised to be more constrained, providing more clarity for implementations and better interoperability. Apple is supporting the revised specification in Safari 12, iOS 12 and macOS 10.14. The implementation in Microsoft Windows also conforms to this revision.

==SING gaiji solution==
In 2005, Adobe shipped a new technology in their Creative Suite applications bundle that offers a solution for &quot;gaiji&quot; (外字, Japanese for &quot;outside character&quot;). Ideographic writing scripts such as Chinese and Japanese do not have fixed collections of characters. They use thousands of glyphs commonly and tens of thousands less commonly. Not all glyphs ever invented and used in East Asian literature have even been catalogued. A typical font might contain 8,000 to 15,000 of the most commonly used glyphs. From time to time, though, an author needs a glyph not present in the font of choice. Such missing characters are known in Japan as gaiji, and they often disrupt work.

Another aspect of the gaiji problem is that of variant glyphs for certain characters. Often certain characters have been written differently over periods of time. It is not unusual for place names or personal family names to use a historical form of a character. Thus it is possible for an end user using standard fonts to be left unable to spell correctly either their own name or the name of the place where they live.

Several ways to deal with gaiji have been devised. Solutions that treat them as characters usually assign arbitrary Unicode values to them in the Private Use Areas (PUA). Such characters cannot be used outside the environment in which the association of the private Unicode to the glyph shape is known. Documents based on them are not portable. Other installations treat gaiji as graphics. This can be cumbersome because text layout and composition cannot apply to graphics. They cannot be searched for. Often their rendering looks different from surrounding characters because the machinery for rendering graphics usually is different from the machinery for rendering glyphs from fonts.

The SING (Smart INdependent Glyphlets) technology that made its debut with Adobe&#x27;s Creative Suite 2 allows for the creation of glyphs, each packaged as a standalone font, after a fashion. Such a packaged glyph is called a &quot;glyphlet&quot;. The format, which Adobe has made public, is based on OpenType. The package consists of the glyph outline in TrueType or CFF (PostScript style outlines) form; standard OpenType tables declaring the glyph&#x27;s metrics and behavior in composition; and metadata, extra information included for identifying the glyphlet, its ownership, and perhaps pronunciation or linguistic categorization. SING glyphlets can be created using Fontlab&#x27;s SigMaker3 application.

The SING specification states that glyphlets are to travel with the document they are used in. That way documents are portable, leaving no danger of characters in the document that cannot be displayed. Because glyphlets are essentially OpenType fonts, standard font machinery can render them. The SING specification also describes an XML format that includes all the data necessary for reconstituting the glyphlet in binary form. A typical glyphlet might require one to two kilobytes to represent.

<text>Norsk Data was a minicomputer manufacturer located in Oslo, Norway. Existing from 1967 to 1998, it had its most active period from the early 1970s to the late 1980s. At the company&#x27;s peak in 1987, it was the second largest company in Norway and employed over 4,500 people.

Throughout its history Norsk Data produced a long string of extremely innovative systems, with a disproportionately large number of world firsts. Some examples of this are the NORD-1, the first minicomputer to have memory paging as a standard option, and the first machine to have floating-point instructions standard, the NORD-5, the world&#x27;s first 32-bit minicomputer (beating the VAX, often claimed the first, by 6 years).

==Historical overview==

The origins of Norsk Data go back to the development of digital computers at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment at Kjeller, Norway, where several early computers had been designed, such as the SAM and the SAM 2, also known as the FLINK.

The success of this program resulted in the founding of &quot;A/S Nordata – Norsk Data Elektronikk&quot; on August 8, 1967, by Lars Monrad Krohn, Per Bjørge and Rolf Skår. The company became a significant supplier of minicomputers to many research projects, in particular to CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, where they were chosen to produce the computers for many projects, starting with the SPS Project, Norsk Data&#x27;s international breakthrough contract. The other market segments Norsk Data succeeded in were process control, Norwegian municipal administration data centers, newspapers, as well as parts of the educational, health, and university sector.

For a period in 1987, Norsk Data was the second largest company by stock value in Norway, second only to Norsk Hydro, and employed over 4,500 people.

In March 1991, shortly after the January Events, Norsk Data donated the first computer to Lithuanian Institute of Mathematics and Informatics. This donation started the development of LITNET, an academic and research network in Lithuania. Later that year, the network connection lines directly connecting Vilnius to Moscow were shut down. With the help of additional hardware donated by Norsk Data, Lithuania was able to use its first satellite-based Internet connection, which operated at 9.6 kbit/s. This was the first Lithuanian communications line that was totally independent from the former Soviet Union.

After a long period of exceptional success, the Norsk Data &quot;empire&quot; collapsed in the early 1990s, mostly due to not realizing the impact of the PC revolution as well as the growing competition from Unix-based systems. In 1987, Norsk Data sought to expand its collaboration with DIAB of Sweden to provide UNIX-based systems in Norsk Data&#x27;s portfolio, to offer &quot;a complete UNIX concept&quot; together with the company&#x27;s ND-5000 products. 1988 saw the company sign an agreement with the Santa Cruz Operation to offer SCO&#x27;s System V product on its Intel-based personal computer systems. In 1989, alongside upgraded versions of the company&#x27;s proprietary minicomputer range, notably the ND-5850, attempts were made to introduce Unix products such as the Uniline 33 range, based on Motorola system designs for the 68030 processor. Such conventional Unix systems were primarily aimed at international customers, whereas in Scandinavia the company reportedly sought to offer only its NDIX implementation of Unix for its own proprietary architecture. Systems based on Motorola&#x27;s 88000 processor were planned to follow on from these new 68030-based products.

Efforts to restructure the company in 1990 were initially perceived as moderately successful, with executives and analysts expressing beliefs that such restructuring had put the company in a more favourable position than competitors who were yet &quot;to swallow the same bitter pill&quot; of refocusing and workforce reductions. Development of Norsk Data technology was continued by Dolphin Server Technology, with this spin-off company aiming to supply Motorola 88000-based systems to its parent. Indeed, Norsk Data introduced the Uniline 88 series of 88000-based systems, developed by Dolphin, initially in Scandinavia during 1990 and then in the UK and Germany during 1991. Norsk Data also announced an agreement with Data General to resell that company&#x27;s Aviion line of 88000-based products. Norsk Data was purchased by Telenor and went through several rebrands and relaunches.

==Notable innovations==
Throughout the times, Norsk Data produced a long string of innovative computers. Some examples of this include:

* The NORD-1, the first minicomputer to have memory paging as a standard option, and the first machine to have floating-point instructions as standard
* The NORD-5, in combination with NORD-1, the world&#x27;s first 32-bit minicomputer or superminicomputer, introduced in 1972, preceding both the Interdata 7/32 and Digital Equipment Corporation VAX that are occasionally cited as the first of their kind
* The NORD-100, a very early application of bitslicing in minicomputers
* The KPS (Knowledge Process System), developed in joint venture with Racal plc, a system which pioneered running a multi-user LISP machine environment

==Post-breakup companies==
Although the Norsk Data breakup caused a large number of layoffs, a large number of employees and intellectual property lived on in various smaller companies. Some went bankrupt quite quickly, some were bought for tax purposes.

The hardware research and development group was split off into Dolphin Server Technology in 1989. Dolphin later split off into a number of companies, by far the most successful of these being Dolphin Interconnect Solutions, a cluster interconnect hardware company.

===Norsk Data UK===
In the UK, Telenor kept the Norsk Data name for several years, focusing in on hardware support and maintenance contracts, mainly with HMCG and local governments.

At the tail end of the &quot;dotcom boom&quot; Telenor decided to try and expand the service by acquiring the ISP CIX and XTML, a hosting company in Manchester, UK. The total expenditure on acquisitions was more than £50 million.

The name and business focus of this group of companies changed several times in the early 21st Century. Initially combined with the acquired CIX and XTML to form the UK arm of Telenor&#x27;s Nextra subsidiary, a &quot;communications service provider&quot;, the group became Telenor Business Solutions before finally reverting to ND Norsk Data once CIX and XTML had been resold to Pipex, reportedly for less than 10% of the purchase price. Much of the loss in value of the acquired companies was put down to the astronomical &quot;goodwill&quot; payment included in the purchase price during the &quot;dotcom boom&quot;.

In 2003, Norsk Data was eventually acquired by 2e2, an IT services business pursuing rapid growth through acquisition, joining various other established businesses including elements of PinkRoccade UK Group and ROCC Computers. This bolstered the hardware maintenance side of the company. The growth by acquisition trend continued with several smaller businesses being taken on, and many employees subsequently being laid off. Major losses of high earning contracts such as Thomas Cook, Woolworths, HMP, or Corus, were never replaced with similar-sized customers.

==Hardware==
Significant Norsk Data computer models include:
*NORD-1, 16-bit minicomputer launched in 1968, could run TSS (see below) from 1971
*NORD-5, 32-bit supermini launched in 1972
*NORD-9,
*NORD-10, 16-bit mini launched in 1973
*NORD-10/S, version of the Nord-10 with cache, paging, and other improvements
*NORD-50, second generation 32-bit supermini in 1975
*NORD-100, 16-bit, from 1978, later renamed ND-100. First single-board 16-bit minicomputer CPU.
*ND-500, third generation 32-bit supermini in 1981
*ND-505, a version of the ND-500 with 29 bit addresses allowed through the CoCom embargo of the Eastern bloc
*ND-5000 (&quot;Samson&quot;), fourth generation 32-bit supermini in 1987 (5400, 5700, 5800)
*ND-5850 (&quot;Rallar&quot;), fifth generation 32-bit supermini in 1987
*ND-5900-2, ND-5900-3, and ND-5904, dual-, triple- and quad-CPU 5000 series machines.
*ND-88000 – ND implementation of the Motorola MC88000 RISC for Unix/NDix – 1987

==Software==
In addition to hardware, Norsk Data also produced a wide range of system and application software:

*NORD-TSS – Nord Time Sharing System from 1971
*SINTRAN – Operating system for Nord 10 and later models, version III from 1973, III/VS in 1974
* XMSG – OSI based (X21 and X.25) communication system, integrated with SINTRAN, with support for both synchronous and asynchronous communication in 1974 and on. Full LU 6.2 support in 1982
*SIBAS database based on the Codasyl database specifications was ported by the Central Institute for Industrial Research in 1975 SIBAS is owned by SRS.
*FORTRAN compiler
*ND-Paint Graphic editing – Windows based
*BASIC compiler developed in Kiel and Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany with the CAT-System (Common Abstract Tree-Language) using the Vienna Development Method, 1983
*COBOL compiler
*C compiler for ND-100/ND-500 developed by University of Luleå, and IAR Systems AB, Sweden, in cooperation with Norsk Data A.S, 1984. A later C compiler developed in Kiel and Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany with the CAT-System using the Vienna Development Method, 1987.
*ND-COSMOS – computer networking system
*PLANC compiler – PLANC was the system language of Norsk Data – a language &quot;defined by its implementation&quot;, similar to C, but assignment left to right, as you read: A + 1 =: A same as A++
*Pascal compiler developed by Prof. Dr. Hans Langmaack and his team at Kiel University in Germany with the CAT-System using the Vienna Development Method, 1987
*PED – &quot;Programmer&#x27;s EDitor&quot; Screen oriented text editor
*LED – &quot;Language-sensitive programmer&#x27;s EDitor&quot; Screen oriented text editor and debugger – complete Integrated Development Environment made for own use.
*ND-NOTIS – Integrated, modular word processing and office application suite with ties to database and customer applications.
*NORTEXT – typesetting system integrated with ND-NOTIS and SIBAS
*Lisp Machine Lisp – MIT Lisp machine lisp developed in a joint venture Racal-Norsk (ZetaLisp).
*Technovision – CAD system developed in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany. Technovision was a modular CAD/CAM system which was internationally considered to be one of the best on the market. It was in part designed by Norsk Data Dietz GmbH. A special workstation named the Technostation was designed specifically for running Technovision. It was extremely well received by international press, and even won a design award.
*BIBDIA – Library system developed by Norsk Data Dietz GmbH in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany. BIBDIA was further developed by BiBer GmbH since 1992. The current WEB-based version is still running as a market leader in Germany and Switzerland.

In addition to the above: 
* two batch languages, called JEC and XCOM. JEC were used primarily as a simple batch job controller, whereas XCOM was used for much more involved routines such as operating system patches etc. Most of the applications came in two different editions, one compiled for the NORD-10/ND-100 series and one compiled for the ND-500/ND-5000 series.
* ND spun off NOTIS-WP and NOTIS-RG into NOTIS AS, which later changed its name to Maxware. NOTIS-QL was copied by Microsoft, where it is called Access (the internal name for NOTIS-QL was &quot;Access-1&quot;) but the original was sold to Sysdeco and sold now with the name &quot;QBEVision&quot;.

==Tim Berners-Lee connection==
The World Wide Web originated when Tim Berners-Lee wrote the ENQUIRE program in Pascal on a Norsk Data NORD-10 running under SINTRAN III at CERN. They also used ND-NOTIS, that was based on SGML, and emailed with NOTIS-MAIL, using tcp/ip, coded in HTML.

<text>The Brewster Aeronautical Corporation was an American defense contractor that was founded in 1932, with a focus on naval aircraft. Wrought with fraud, mismanagement and inefficient production, the United States Navy eventually stepped in to take direct control for a period, and the company folded at the end of World War II.

== History ==
Originally a carriage builder, Brewster &amp; Co.&#x27;s involvement in aviation began in the aftermath of World War I, when it started manufacturing hulls for Loening amphibians. By 1928, it was building floats for the Vought O2U Corsair. In 1932, James Work, an aeronautical engineer, bought the division for () and created the Brewster Aeronautical Corporation. Brewster started out making seaplane floats and wing panels, but with the hire of chief engineer Dayton Brown it embarked on its own designs. It operated three aircraft plants, at the Brewster Building in Long Island City, New York, Newark, New Jersey, and, in 1941, in Warminster Township, Pennsylvania, which was then known as NAS Johnsville.

Brown&#x27;s first design, in 1934, was a two-seat scout-bomber, the Brewster SBA, which first flew in 1936; subsequently the Naval Aircraft Factory built them, with the designation SBN-1. The Brewster SB2A Buccaneer was a follow-on design that first flew in 1941 and was also ordered by the Royal Air Force, who named it the Bermuda.

A design in 1936 for a carrier-capable monoplane fighter resulted in the Brewster F2A (named Buffalo by the British), which was chosen over an early version of the Grumman F4F Wildcat. The F2A prototype handled well in 1938 tests, and the Navy ordered 54. However, production was slow, at least partly due to the inefficient factory in the Brewster Building. The Navy ended up ordering Wildcats, which by 1938 had been greatly improved.

Buffalos were exported to Finland starting in 1939, and more were intended for Belgium, but before deliveries could begin, Germany conquered the country. The United Kingdom also received Buffalos, which eventually ended up in the Far East. They suffered badly in combat against Japanese Zeros. The Buffalos were most popular with the Finnish Air Force, which used them successfully against the Soviet air force, and began a program to build an indigenous version named the Humu. The Dutch also purchased 92 Buffalos and assigned most to the &quot;Militaire Luchtvaart KNIL&quot; in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) where they fought against the Japanese. Several captured by the Japanese were repainted with Japanese &quot;Hinomaru&quot; insignia and extensively tested.

During World War II, it became apparent that Brewster was mismanaged. The company had grown from a relatively minor aircraft parts supplier to a full-fledged defense giant in only a few years. Brewster ranked 84th among United States corporations in value of World War II military production contracts. Jimmy Work had hired Alfred and Ignacio Miranda as the company salesmen. They had been involved in frauds, spending two years in prison for selling illicit arms to Bolivia, and had over-promised Brewster production capabilities to customers.

As the war swelled the defense industries, the quality of the newly hired work force was inferior in skills and often motivation, and the work was plagued by illicit strikes; even outright sabotage was suspected. The Navy installed George Chapline as president of the company, easing out Jimmy Work, in the hopes of speeding up production. But then in early 1942 Jimmy Work regained control, just in time to be sued for $10million (equivalent to $ million in ) for financial misdeeds. On April 18, 1942, the Navy simply seized Brewster and put the former head of the Naval Aircraft Factory, George Conrad Westervelt, in charge. In mid-May, a new board of directors was appointed by the Navy, with Brewster making the F3A-1 Corsair under license.

When the Navy cancelled Brewster&#x27;s last contract, for assembly of the Corsair, on July 1, 1944, the company was in serious trouble. In October, after reporting a large loss, the management decided to shut down the company, and on April 5, 1946, the Brewster Aeronautical Corporation was dissolved by its shareholders.

<text>Tandberg was an electronics manufacturer located in Oslo, Norway (production, sales and distribution) and New York City, United States (sales and distribution). The company began in the radio field, but became more widely known for their reel-to-reel tape recorders as well as cassette decks and televisions. The original company went bankrupt in 1978, after a sharp financial downturn. The following year, the company re-formed whilst their data division was split off as Tandberg Data, including the tape recording division, which reduced its scope to data recording.

Over time the original Tandberg company became increasingly involved in the teleconferencing systems, and became a leader in that field. The company&#x27;s main competitor was Polycom and other competitors were HP, Sony, Radvision, VTEL and Aethra.

Cisco Systems acquired Tandberg on 19 April 2010. Tandberg Data is now officially a German company, and continues to make computer tape storage systems.

==History==

===Tandbergs Radiofabrikk===
The company was founded by Vebjørn Tandberg as Tandbergs Radiofabrikk (Tandberg&#x27;s Radio Factory) in Oslo in 1933. The company&#x27;s first radio was named &quot;Tommeliten&quot; (Tom Thumb), and used only earphones. This was followed by the &quot;Corona&quot; with a loudspeaker. In 1934, the first &quot;Huldra&quot; radio was launched, followed in 1936 by the &quot;Sølvsuper&quot;. During the early years, radios, loudspeakers and microphones were the main output from the factory. The Sølvsuper and the Huldra radios became the foundation for Tandberg&#x27;s success.

In the early 1950s, Tandberg opened a branch plant at Kjelsås (in Oslo) to produce reel-to-reel tape recorders. Their first model was introduced to the market in 1952. Over the next decade, Tandberg quickly incorporated a number of leading-edge concepts; the model 2 Hi-Fi of 1956 had three tape transport speeds, allowing improved high-frequency response. The model 3 Stereo from 1957 was Tandberg&#x27;s first stereo system which allowed playback of stereo tapes, however the ability to record in stereo was not made available until the introduction of the model 5 in 1958, which allowed for the connection of an external recording amplifier to record the second channel onto the tape. Their first full stereo system, the model 6 of 1960, featured four amplifiers, two for recording and two for playback respectively, giving the operator total control of both audio channels. In the 1960s, Tandberg introduced the cross-field recording technique in the model 6X, allowing their recorders to handle higher frequencies than competing models. Tandberg licensed the concept to Akai, who utilized it extensively in the 1970s and 80s, in their Akai and Roberts recorders. In 1964, Tandberg inaugurated a new method of language teaching, the language laboratory, and with it their first fully transistorized tape recorder, the model 10, a recorder designed to serve as the teacher recorder in language classrooms. However the first transistorized recorder marketed to consumers was the model 12 of 1966, which among other things featured low impedance microphone inputs, designed for their first dynamic microphone, the TM 4. In 1969, Tandberg finally abandoned the use of vacuum tubes in their recorders, and the 6X which had introduced cross-field recording to the world, the last tube recorder still manufactured by Tandberg, went out of production. That same year a new lineup of transistorized Tandberg recorders entered the market to fill the gap left by the preceding models.

Tandberg tape recorders dominated the Norwegian market, and had a reputation for advanced technology and high quality at reasonable prices. It was on Tandberg reel-to-reel machines that President John F. Kennedy recorded many meetings in the Cabinet Room of the White House, including those associated with the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The Kjelsås factory also started producing TV sets in 1960, and in 1966, a second TV plant was opened in Kjeller in Skedsmo. Colour TV&#x27;s were added to their lineup in 1969. In 1972, Tandberg purchased Radionette, another large Norwegian electronics firm now focusing on televisions. By 1976, TVs were Tandberg&#x27;s major product and their factories employed 3,500. However, that same year a major economic downturn seriously disrupted the company, and by 1978, it was insolvent. A shareholder revolt removed Vebjørn Tandberg from control of the company, and he committed suicide in August. In December, the company declared bankruptcy.

===Split-up===
In the aftermath of the bankruptcy, the original Tandberg was split into two parts. Under the control of Siemens, Tandberg Data took over the computer terminal and tape recording parts of the company, moving the latter purely into the computer storage field. The remaining portions went under control of Norsk Data and lost the &quot;Radiofabrikk&quot; to become, simply, Tandberg.

Tandberg continued to develop audio technology including Actilinear and Dyneq.

In 1984, the consumer audio equipment division was spun off to become Tandberg Audio.

Tandberg&#x27;s first picture telephone for ISDN was developed in 1989, while the fully integrated &quot;Vision&quot; H.320 picture telephone was launched in 1993. Subsequently, focus moved to higher performance systems – the &quot;Grand Vision&quot; and the &quot;Master Vision&quot; series. New desktop endpoints were also added – the &quot;Compact Vision&quot; and the &quot;Vision600&quot;.

The first US office opened in 1995 in Connecticut. It was moved to Kansas City for a short period before moving to Reston, Virginia in August 1996. In 1997, the company acquired two sales and distribution companies in North America, establishing a firm foothold in the single largest videoconferencing market in the world. It created two large sales and support offices in the US, one in Virginia and the other in Texas. The office in Reston, Virginia remains the largest office in the US to this day.

Also in 1997, the television manufacturing portions became Tandberg Television.

In 1999, the company acquired the Norwegian technology company Internet Technology AS which had developers experienced with the ITU H.323 standard, especially from VoIP-projects like the world&#x27;s first commercial H.323 VoIP service launched in 1997 with Telenor.

In 2000, the company moved into IP-based videoconferencing using the maturing H.323 standard, making the entire product line IP-capable. Since 2000, the company has expanded its product line greatly, by adding enterprise-class MCUs, gateways, service-provider class MCUs and H.323 gatekeepers. In 2001, the company also acquired a consultancy company Delante AS which enabled it to focus more on external software integration and bindings, especially the Microsoft platform. In 2004, Ridgeway Systems and Software, a UK-based software house specializing in firewall and NAT traversal, was acquired. The result of this acquisition was the Tandberg Expressway Firewall Traversal technology, which allows any H.323 video endpoint to place calls through any number of firewalls or NAT devices.

In July 2004, the company released a major new endpoint product line, the &quot;MXP&quot; series.

In February 2005, the company released SIP software for all its video endpoints, as well as a major update to its SCCP based video systems.

In July 2005, the company acquired IVIGO from TNO Telecom. IVIGO, based in the Netherlands, developed and successfully commercialized circuit-switched video solutions for UMTS network operators, vendors and content providers. The IVIGO 3G-to-H.323 video gateway is now used by Tandberg&#x27;s high-end visual communications systems to connect over video to 3G handheld phones.
In September 2005, Cisco Systems officially launched the Cisco 7985G, a Cisco-Tandberg co-branded desktop videophone.

In October 2005, the company acquired Ectus, a New Zealand-based software development company specializing in streaming and archiving software.

On 16 December 2005, Andrew Miller stepped down as CEO, replaced by the CFO Fredrik Halvorsen. Halvorsen was a relatively new hire with a background from McKinsey.

In September 2007, the company acquired Codian, a rival developer of video-conferencing infrastructure products, for $270 million in cash and shares.

In 2009, the company introduced the full-HD &quot;C-series&quot; endpoint product line, including the &quot;EX-series&quot; desktop appliances, progressively replacing the previous &quot;MXP&quot; product series.

In October 2009, Cisco Systems made a $3 billion recommended offer to acquire Tandberg. After upping its offer to almost $3.4 billion, Cisco announced on 4 December 2009, that over 90% of Tandberg&#x27;s shares had been tendered, allowing it to squeeze out the remaining shareholders. In February 2011, Tandberg was officially rebranded to Cisco, however the Tandberg name continues to be extensively used (as of mid 2011).

===Codian===
Codian is a former supplier of video conferencing products. The company became part of Tandberg in 2007. Codian was founded in 2002, and based in Langley, Slough, UK. Its main products included Multipoint Control Units and gateways. It was acquired by Tandberg in 2007 for US$270 million and its products continued to be sold under the &quot;Tandberg Codian&quot; brand name. Codian products are still supported and developed by Cisco under the same brand name, and Codian&#x27;s original technology was used by Cisco to develop its own line of TelePresence servers.

==Companies sharing the name==
There are also other companies called Tandberg with roots in the same parent company, although not necessarily with common ownership:
* SANAKO/Tandberg Educational
* Tandberg Audio
* Tandberg Unterrichtstechnik (Deutschland)
* Tandberg Data
* Tandberg Storage
* Tandberg Telecom – fully owned subsidiary
* Tandberg Television

==Products==

* Immersive Conferencing systems: Tandberg T1 &amp; T3,
* Personal systems such as desktop systems, video enabled VOIP phones and video-conferencing solutions for mobile phones and tablets
* Call Control systems like the Video Communication server or the enterprise level Unified Communications Manager
* Videoconference Manager: Cisco Telepresence Manager and the software suite to manage the CTM. The CTM makes it possible to connect any device in a single &quot;Telepresence&quot; conference call
* CTM Director for enterprise wide management of all CTM endpoints
* Infrastructure systems:
:* Telepresence server
:* MSE 8000 series multipoint video conferencing systems
:* MCU conferencing bridges: MCU 4200 and 4500 series
:* Media Processing System: MPS200 and MPS800
:* Cisco Telepresence multipoint switches: combine any type of TP endpoints in one call
:* Infrastructure: Advanced Media Gateway, IP Gateway server, IP/ISDN Gateway servers and content servers
:* Conference recorders: Tandberg IP VCR and Cisco Telepresence Recording server to allow recording of multipoint video conferences
:* Video conferencing cloud services: enable video conferences between different companies crossing one&#x27;s own (network) borders, but maintaining high level of security.

With the supporting system included in the Immersive systems or dedicated management servers, all these systems can interact with each other and be used in one conference session: people using a video-enabled smartphone or tablet can participate in a conference-call setup using the CTS models, and everyone automatically receives both optimal image quality and features for their system. The proprietary protocol used in the Immersive TP systems can interact with industry open standards used in mobile phones, tablets and video-enabled VOIP devices regardless of their vendor: any device can connect to any other system
The product portfolio of existing Cisco video conferencing solutions and the Tandberg systems are now combined in one portfolio. The Tandberg product names have changed, but they are still being offered using the Tandberg brand name, and overlaps still remain in the portfolio.

==Controversy==
In November 2010, Fiona Glaser, an x264 developer, published information in which she claims that one of Tandberg Telecom&#x27;s patent applications from December 2008, contains a step-by-step description of an algorithm she committed to the x264 codebase around two months earlier. This was relayed by media, which remarked that the employee who filed the patent was following the x264 project IRC development channel and was known to the project developers, leading to Tandberg claiming that they discovered the algorithm independently. Copies of e-mails that demonstrate this, together with an affidavit and an Information disclosure statement was filed by Tandberg with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in June 2011.

<text>Dolphin Interconnect Solutions is a privately held manufacturer of high-speed data communication systems headquartered in Oslo, Norway and Woodsville, New Hampshire, USA.

The technology of Dolphin was based on development work at Norsk Data during the late 1980s. Dolphin Interconnect Solutions was founded in 1992 as a spin-off from Dolphin Server Technology which was, in turn, a spin-off from Norsk Data in 1989. Dolphin Interconnect Solutions develops technology for low latency and high-speed communication between servers and/or embedded computer systems.

== History ==
Dolphin Server Technology emerged from Norsk Data, &quot;a formerly flourishing Norwegian minicomputer maker&quot;, with one of its aims to build a business developing systems based on the Motorola 88000 architecture, these being adopted by Norsk Data as the new company&#x27;s initial customer, with the intention of gradually reducing Norsk Data&#x27;s stake to less than 50 percent and thus gradually increasing the new company&#x27;s independence. Dolphin was established as a consequence of the restructuring of Norsk Data in 1988, the separation of product development from other aspects of the parent company&#x27;s business, and the transfer of 125 employees from Norsk Data&#x27;s development divisions. Another initial activity was to develop a Unix system for Norsk Data&#x27;s existing ND-5000 range.

Following an initial product announcement in late 1989, by April 1990, Dolphin Server Technology had started shipping products in its Triton 88 series, based on the Motorola 88000 processor family, with these systems supporting up to four processors. Compliant with the 88open Consortium&#x27;s standards, the Triton 88 series ran a Unix product developed by UniSoft, providing binary compatibility with contemporary 88000-based systems. Dolphin offered these products through value-added resellers in European, North American, and South American markets, also cultivating business with original equipment manufacturers, resulting in the Triton 88 models appearing &quot;under several different brand names&quot; worldwide.

Having announced plans for an emitter-coupled logic (ECL) version of the Motorola 88000, projected to run at 125 MHz, executing up to eight instructions in parallel, and delivering a peak performance of 1000 MIPS, Dolphin Server Technology participated in the development and standardization of Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) technology, delivering the first prototype in 1992 for an implementation of the base SCI standard as a gate array fabricated by Vitesse Semiconductor. A CMOS implementation was demonstrated in 1994 in association with LSI Logic.

They were among the pioneers in the development and commercialization of the Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) technology. SCI was one of the earliest high-speed interconnect technologies designed to enable multiprocessing and data sharing across a wide area, significantly enhancing the performance of clustered computing environments. This innovation helped set the stage for the development of modern high-performance computing networks.

The company had announced its plans for the ECL variant of the 88000, named Orion and developed in conjunction with Motorola, in December 1989. This processor, employing a technique called &quot;instruction folding&quot; originating from research done within Norsk Data, involved &quot;a mutual exchange of patented technology&quot; between the companies. It was hoped that Orion would ship in the first half of 1992. Initially mentioned in Norsk Data&#x27;s 1988 annual report, Orion was also the subject of a project under the auspices of the EUREKA programme in association with Siemens and NTNU, &quot;building on four different technologies from Siemens AG, Motorola Inc., National Semiconductor Ltd. and Dolphin&quot;.

Dolphin&#x27;s ECL variant had, however, reportedly been abandoned already in early 1991 due to unspecified difficulties, with the company refocusing its Orion efforts on &quot;Motorola&#x27;s post-88110, 100MHz BiCMOS technology&quot;. The company planned to deliver an &quot;interim Triton SCI system&quot; early in 1992, combining elements of Orion with the Motorola 88110, awaiting SCI&#x27;s ratification by the IEEE before committing to a final product. Meanwhile, Dolphin planned enhancements to its Triton88 product, including a plug-in board with up to five 88000 processors and support for Unix System V Release 4. The company also introduced a low-end Triton88 system to its range in September 1991, priced just below £.

In 1993, Dolphin, described as a vendor of &quot;RISC-based UNIX multiprocessor servers&quot; specializing in solutions for the government and banking, announced a deal with NeXT to resell NeXT computer products and to license NeXT&#x27;s software technology. Ultimately, Dolphin &quot;abandoned the server market entirely&quot;, the SCI product business itself being spun out as Dolphin Interconnect Solutions prior to TBK Telematikk&#x27;s acquisition of Dolphin Server Technology in 1994. The acquired business was reoriented, becoming &quot;a subsidiary focusing on support&quot; within TBK, itself an organisation wholly owned by the Norwegian telecommunications monopoly that would later become Telenor.

== Products ==
Dolphin started out continuing the development of a line of SCI products from Norsk Data, by implementing customer-specific technology, as well as providing Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) and later PCIe boards for commodity and high-performance computing (HPC) systems.
Sun Microsystems agreed to re-sell Dolphin&#x27;s SCI interfaces for the SBus in 1996.
Dolphin SCI products are available under the Dolphin Express SCI label.

The StarFabric product line was added through the acquisition of StarGen Inc. in early 2007.
StarGen shareholders received about 22% of the combined company. StarGen, which became the US subsidiary of Dolphin, had been based in Marlborough, Massachusetts, and led by Tim Miller.
StarFabric provides a PCI-based interconnect running over standard Ethernet Category 5 cables.
Similarly, the Dolphin Express DX product line introduced in 2006 was also acquired from StarGen. DX was based on the Advanced Switching Interconnect (ASI) standard and implements a PCI Express Gen1 switched-topology technology supporting both host to host communication and host to IO expansion over an individual cable connection.
A company called Numascale was spun out of Dolphin in 2008, referring to the concept of non-uniform memory access (NUMA).

The Dolphin Express IX product line introduced in 2010 is based on PCIe Gen2 and Gen3 integrated circuits (&quot;chips&quot;) from Integrated Device Technology. The Dolphin Express PX product line, introduced in 2016, is based on PCI Express Gen3 chipsets from Broadcom. IX and PX implements a PCIe-native switched-topology technology. 
The SISCI application programming interface (API) was developed for the shared memory SCI hardware. With the introduction of the PX, IX, and DX-line of products, the API was expanded to support features like reflective memory, multicast and PCIe peer-to-peer communication.

SuperSockets is a software platform for Dolphin Express providing a low latency, high throughput implementation of the Berkeley sockets and Winsock APIs. It was introduced in 2007.

SmartIO has been used to share GPUs, NVMe drives, and other devices in a PCIe network.

<text>MediaKind (formerly Ericsson Television) is a global video technology company providing MPEG-4 AVC, MPEG-2 and HEVC encoding and decoding solutions, as well as stream processing, packaging, network adaption and related products, for Cloud, Contribution &amp; Distribution (C+D), IPTV, Cable, DTT, Satellite DTH and OTT. The global headquarters are located in Frisco, TX, USA, with additional offices in Southampton (UK) and Rennes (France).

The company has its roots in the Tandberg Television company that was founded in 1979 and acquired by Ericsson in 2007, as well as Envivio; founded in 2000 and acquired by Ericsson in 2015,

== Company history ==
=== Roots ===
Tandberg was a long-standing Norwegian company whose history went back to the 1930s when it supplied domestic radio equipment. It grew into other areas during the decades after WW2 including a well-respected audio equipment manufacturer and its reel-to-reel tape recorders were sought after by HiFi enthusiasts.

The Kjelsas factory also started producing TV sets in 1960, and in 1966, a second TV plant was opened in Kjeller in Skedsmo. Color TVs were added to their lineup in 1969. In 1972, Tandberg purchased &quot;Radionette&quot;, another large Norwegian electronics firm that has just begun focusing on televisions.

By 1976, TVs were Tandberg&#x27;s major product and their factories employed 3,500. However, that same year a major economic downturn seriously disrupted the company, and by 1978 it was insolvent. A shareholder revolt removed Vebjorn Tandberg from control of the company, and he committed suicide in August. In December the company declared bankruptcy.

&quot;Tandberg Television&quot;, originally with headquarters in Lillestrom near Oslo, Norway, was formed in 1979 when the original Tandberg company split into Tandberg, Tandberg Data, and Tandberg Television.

===After the breakup of 1979===
In 1999, Tandberg Television entered into a £170 million agreement to acquire all the assets of NDS Group’s Digital-TV products business, the Digital Broadcasting Business (DBB), a subsidiary of News Corporation. After the acquisition, Tandberg Television could offer digital video compression encoders, multiplexers and modulation products for large satellite DTH systems, terrestrial networks and mobile news gathering solutions.

NDS Group itself was a merger in 1996 between News Corp&#x27;s existing News Data Communications (NDC) based in Israel, a company that supplied smart cards to pay TV operators like Sky TV, and Digi-Media Vision (DMV) a video compression company that News had acquired in 1995, and had been the Advanced Products Division [APD] of National Transcommunications Limited [NTL] in the UK. NTL was itself established in 1990 as the privatised Engineering arm of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the UK commercial broadcasting regulator and operator of all commercial terrestrial television and radio transmitters. APD was the Experimental and Development (E&amp;D) department of the IBA.

Much earlier, in 1987, Tandberg Television and the IBA&#x27;s E&amp;D and Satellite Engineering groups had worked together to build a satellite broadcasting system for the UK based on the ill-fated MAC system operated by Sky&#x27;s rival British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB). BSB and Sky merged in 1990 to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) which has become a significant broadcaster in the UK.

Since 1999, Tandberg Television has acquired four US-based digital media companies. In October 2005, they acquired Los Angeles-based Goldpocket Interactive, an interactive technology provider for digital television, the Internet and wireless/mobile networks. Further, in February 2006, they acquired SkyStream Networks, a provider of Internet Protocol MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 AVC video delivery solutions, based in Sunnyvale, California. Later the same year, they acquired Los Angeles-based Internet TV software developer Zetools.

===2007–2010: Acquisition by Ericsson ===
In April 2007, Tandberg Television was acquired by Ericsson. Ericsson Television operates as an independent entity.

The company was honored with its first Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award in 2008 for the development of interactive Video-on-Demand infrastructure and signaling, leading to large scale VOD implementations.
It was also awarded another Emmy in 2009 for Pioneering Development of MPEG-4 AVC systems for HDTV, thanks to the implementation and deployment of the first HD MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) Broadcast encoder.

In 2010, the company was renamed &quot;Ericsson Television&quot;.

In 2011, for the Pioneering Development and Deployment of Active Format Description Technology and System. In 2013, the company acquired another Emmy award for the Pioneering Development Of Video On Demand (VOD) Dynamic Advertising Insertion. Recently in 2014, Ericsson got its fifth Emmy® Award recognition for its work in developing pioneering JPEG2000 interoperability technology.

===2018–today: MediaKind===
In 2018, Ericsson completed the successful consolidation of all acquired businesses connected to Tandberg Television/Ericsson Television, along with Envivio, Microsoft Mediaroom, Azuki Reach, and Fabrix Video Storage and Processing Platform (VSPP), plus its own Media Delivery Network (MDN). This combined business was rebranded as MediaKind. It was announced that Ericsson has partnered with One Equity Partners, a private equity firm with expertise in media and telecom investments, to further develop Media Solutions. In January 2019, Ericsson transferred the majority of shares in its Media Solutions business (51%) to &quot;One Equity Partners&quot; as part of a divestment. Ericsson itself retained 49%.

<text>The name destroying angel applies to several similar, closely related species of deadly all-white mushrooms in the genus &quot;Amanita&quot;. They are &quot;Amanita virosa&quot; in Europe and &quot;A. bisporigera&quot; and &quot;A. ocreata&quot; in eastern and western North America, respectively. Another European species of &quot;Amanita&quot; referred to as the destroying angel, &quot;Amanita verna&quot;—also referred to as the &quot;Fool&#x27;s mushroom&quot;—was first described in France in 1780.

Destroying angels are among the most toxic known mushrooms; both they and the closely related death caps (&quot;A. phalloides&quot;) contain amatoxins.

== Description ==
Destroying angels are characterized by having gills and white stalks. The cap can be pure white, or white at the edge and yellowish, pinkish, or tan at the center. It has a partial veil, or ring (annulus) circling the upper stalk, and the gills are &quot;free&quot;, not attached to the stalk. Perhaps the most telltale of the features is the presence of a volva, or universal veil, so called because it is a membrane that encapsulates the entire mushroom, rather like an egg, when it is very young. This structure breaks as the young mushroom expands, leaving parts that can be found at the base of the stalk as a boot or cuplike structure, and there may be patches of removable material on the cap surface. This combination of features, all found together in the same mushroom, is the hallmark of the family. While other families may have any one or two of these features, none has them all. The cap is usually about across; the stipe is usually long and about thick. They are found singly or in small groups.

Destroying angels can be mistaken for edible fungi such as the button mushroom, meadow mushroom, or the horse mushroom. Young destroying angels that are still enclosed in their universal veils can be mistaken for puffballs, but slicing them in half longitudinally will reveal internal mushroom structures. This is the basis for the common recommendation to slice in half all puffball-like mushrooms picked when mushroom hunting. Mushroom hunters recommend that people know how to recognize both the death cap and the destroying angel in &quot;all&quot; of their forms before collecting any white gilled mushroom for consumption.

== Distribution and habitat ==

All &quot;Amanita&quot; species form ectomycorrhizal relationships with the roots of certain trees. Thus, destroying angels grow in or near the edges of woodlands. They can also be found on lawns or grassy meadows near trees or shrubs. Several species called destroying angel are found all over the world. &quot;Amanita bisporigera&quot; is associated with oaks and conifers.

== Toxicity ==
The destroying angel (&quot;Amanita bisporigera&quot;) and the death cap (&quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;) account for the overwhelming majority of deaths due to mushroom poisoning. The toxin responsible for this is amatoxin, which inhibits RNA polymerase II and III. Symptoms do not appear for 5 to 24 hours, by which time the toxins may already be absorbed and the damage (destruction of liver and kidney tissues) is irreversible. As little as half a mushroom cap can be fatal if the victim is not treated quickly enough. The symptoms include vomiting, cramps, delirium, convulsions, and diarrhea. In one study, people who had ingested the toxin were treated with &quot;fluid and electrolyte replacement, oral activated charcoal and lactulose, IV penicillin, combined hemodialysis and hemoperfusion in two 8-hour sessions,&quot; some with &quot;IV thioctic acid, others IV silibinin&quot; and all received a &quot;special diet.&quot; It was concluded that &quot;...intensive combined treatment applied in these cases is effective in relieving patients with both moderate and severe amanitin poisoning.&quot;

== Tandberg Storage ==

Tandberg Storage ASA was a magnetic tape data storage company based in Lysaker, Norway. The company was a subsidiary of Tandberg Data. The company was spun off from Tandberg Data in 2003 to focus exclusively on tape drives. It was purchased by the same company in 2008. Tandberg Storage developed four drive series, all based on Linear Tape-Open (LTO) specifications. Manufacturing was outsourced to the Chinese-based Lafè Peripherals International. Tandberg Storage also owned 93.5% of O-Mass AS. The company was declared bankrupt together with Tandberg Data in 2009.

===History===
Tandberg Storage was established as a spin-off of Tandberg Data on 22 May 2003. Tandberg Storage had previously been an integrated part of Tandberg Data, but management wanted the two companies to follow separate research and development strategies. While Tandberg Data retained responsibility on complete storage and automation systems, Tandberg Storage would focus on advanced tape-drive technologies. Tandberg Storage was established with 37 research and development employees, plus a 93.5% ownership of O-Mass. The company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 2 October 2003, with the owners of Tandberg Data receiving all the shares in Tandberg Storage.

The initial goal of the company was to develop a LTO-2 linear tape-open drive within a half-height form factor. While the underlying technology had been developed, the main components needed to be developed, in particular the drive mechanism. A working system was demonstrated in December 2003, and in June 2004 the first complete prototype could be tested. In October, the test program started, and from December verification was initiated with the LTO Committee. The drive was approved on 11 March 2005. In the second half of 2005, Tandberg Storage developed Serial Attached SCSI and application and data integration. These were both launched in 2006. In 2005, the company also started development of a half-height LTO-3 drive. The product was launched in 2007. The following year, a no-encryption LTO-4 was launched.

In November 2008, Tandberg Storage merged with Tandberg Data, with the latter paying the former&#x27;s owners in shares. Both companies had been having financial problems, and the cooperation between the two had been difficult during 2008. Tandberg Storage was at the time the largest supplier to Tandberg Data. By merging, the managements hoped to gain synergy effects between the two companies. Until the announcement of the merger in September, Tandberg Storage&#x27;s share price had fallen 89% since the start of the year. Following the announcement, the share price fell a further 35%. The take-over involved a refinancing of the debt in Tandberg Storage. Tandberg Storage remained a subsidiary.

===Operations===
The company was based at Lysaker in Bærum, just outside Oslo, Norway. Of the 54 employees in 2007, 45 worked within research and development. The main competitors offering LTO drives were Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Quantum.

===Products===
Tandberg Storage produced a full range of Linear Tape-Open drives, between 100 and 800 gigabytes. Manufactured by Lafè Peripherals International of China, there are four models available. All drives were built around a common half-height aluminum casting. All drives, except the TS200, have variable transfer rate systems to match host transfer speeds. All drives have the lowest power consumption in the industry, and do not require external fans. In 2006, Tandberg Storage held a 26% worldwide market share.

<doc id="194791" wikidata="Q573972" url="?curid=194791" title="Battle of Rossbach">
<text>The Battle of Rossbach took place on 5November 1757 during the Third Silesian War (1756–1763, part of the Seven Years&#x27; War) near the village of Rossbach (Roßbach), in the Electorate of Saxony. It is sometimes called the Battle of, or at, Reichardtswerben, after a different nearby town. In this 90-minute battle, Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, defeated an Allied army composed of French forces augmented by a contingent of the Reichsarmee (Imperial Army) of the Holy Roman Empire. The French and Imperial army included 41,110 men, opposing a considerably smaller Prussian force of 22,000. Despite overwhelming odds, Frederick managed to defeat the Imperials and the French.

The Battle of Rossbach marked a turning point in the Seven Years&#x27; War, not only for its stunning Prussian victory, but because France refused to send troops against Prussia again and Britain, noting Prussia&#x27;s military success, increased its financial support for Frederick. Following the battle, Frederick immediately left Rossbach and marched for 13 days to the outskirts of Breslau. There he met the Austrian army at the Battle of Leuthen; he employed similar tactics to again defeat an army considerably larger than his own.

Rossbach is considered one of Frederick&#x27;s greatest strategic masterpieces. He crippled an enemy army twice the size of the Prussian force while suffering negligible casualties. His artillery also played a critical role in the victory, based on its ability to reposition itself rapidly responding to changing circumstances on the battlefield. Finally, his cavalry contributed decisively to the outcome of the battle, justifying his investment of resources into its training during the eight-year interim between the conclusion of the War of Austrian Succession and the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

Although the Seven Years&#x27; War was a global conflict, it took a specific intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle concluded the earlier war in which Prussia and Austria were a part; its influence among the European powers was little better than a truce. Frederick II of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, acquired the prosperous province of Silesia, but had wanted much of the Saxon territories as well. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire. By 1754, escalating tensions between Britain and France in North America offered the Empress the opportunity to regain her lost Central European territories and to limit Prussia&#x27;s growing power. Similarly, France sought to break the British control of Atlantic trade. France and Austria put aside their old rivalry to form a coalition of their own. Faced with this sudden turn of events, the British king, George II, aligned himself with his nephew, Frederick, and the Kingdom of Prussia; this alliance drew in not only the British king&#x27;s territories held in personal union, including Hanover, but also those of his and Frederick&#x27;s relatives in the Electorate of Hanover and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This series of political maneuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.

===Situation in 1757===
At the start of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—in any company—could fire at least four musket volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five; his army could march a day, and was able to conduct, even under fire, some of the most complex maneuvers known. After overrunning Saxony, Frederick campaigned in Bohemia and defeated the Austrians on 6May 1757 at the Battle of Prague. Initially successful, everything after the Battle of Kolín, went awry: what had started as a war of movement by Frederick&#x27;s agile army turned into a war of attrition.

By summer 1757, Prussia was threatened on two fronts. In the east, the Russians, under Field Marshal Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin, besieged Memel with 75,000 troops. Memel had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia, but after five days of artillery bombardment, the Russian army successfully stormed it. The Russians then used Memel as a base to invade East Prussia and defeated a smaller Prussian force in the fiercely contested Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August 1757. However, the Russians were unable to take Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia, after using up their supplies of cannonballs at Memel and Gross-Jägersdorf, and retreated soon afterward. The logistics of supplying a large army remained a problem for the Russians throughout the war. Although previous experiences in wars with the Ottoman Empire had exposed these problems, the Russians had not solved the challenge of supplying their army at a distance from Moscow. Even so, the Imperial Russian Army offered a new threat to Prussia, forcing Frederick to abandon his invasion of Bohemia and to withdraw further into Prussian territory.

In Saxony and Silesia, the Austrian forces slowly reclaimed territory held by Frederick earlier in the year. In September, at the Battle of Moys, Prince Charles&#x27;s Austrians defeated the Prussians commanded by Hans Karl von Winterfeldt, one of Frederick&#x27;s most trusted generals, who was killed in the battle. As summer ended, a combined force of French and the &quot;Reichsarmee&quot; (Imperial Army) troops, approaching from the west, intended to unite with Prince Charles&#x27;s main Austrian force, which itself advanced west to Breslau. Prince Soubise and Prince Joseph of Saxe-Hildburghausen shared command of the Allied force.

If these armies were to unite, Prussia&#x27;s situation would be dire indeed. Recognizing this threat, Frederick used the strategy of interior lines to advance in a quick, arduous march reminiscent of the forced marches of his great-grandfather, Frederick William I, the &quot;Great Elector&quot;. An army marches only as fast as its slowest components, which are usually the supply trains, and Frederick obtained needed supplies ahead of the army, which enabled him to abandon his supply wagons. His army covered in only 13 days. Bringing his enemy to battle proved difficult, as the Allies flitted out of his reach. Both Frederick and his enemies moved back and forth for several days, trying to maneuver around each other but ending up in a stalemate. During this time, an Austrian raiding party attacked Berlin and almost captured the Prussian royal family.

==Terrain and maneuvers==
The story of the Battle of Rossbach is as much the story of the five days of maneuvering, leading to the battle as it is of those famous 90 minutes of battle, and the maneuvers that were shaped by the terrain. Initial activity focused on the village of Weissenfels, where the middle Saale emerges from the Buntsandstein of the Thuringian Basin in the Leipzig highlands, not far from the modern-day A9 highway. Parts of the valley between Leipzig and Saale were relatively narrow, cut by the river and its tributaries; the hillsides were steep, with limited river crossings; this influenced the troop movements leading to the battle, as the various armies competed for sites to cross the river.

The scene of the battle at Rossbach, lay southwest of Merseburg, on a wide plateau dotted by hillocks with elevations up to . The locale was a wide plain largely without trees or hedges. The ground was sandy in some areas, and marshy in others; a small stream ran between Rossbach and Merseburg, south of which rose two low hills, the Janus and the Pölzen. Thomas Carlyle later described these as unimpressive, although certainly horses dragging cannons would notice them, as the animals slipped in loose stones and sand. To the west, the Saale flowed past a small town of Weissenfels, a few miles southeast of Rossbach.
On 24 October, the Prussian Field Marshal James Keith was in Leipzig when the Imperial Army occupied Weissenfels. Frederick joined him there two days later. Over the next couple of days, the King&#x27;s brother, Prince Henry, arrived with the main body of the army and his brother-in-law, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, arrived from Magdeburg. Prince Moritz of Anhalt-Dessau arrived by 28 October; although his men had marched up to in a day, they were still eager to face the Allied forces, who had established a post close to Markranstädt, and maintained some line of control along the Saale river. This gave Prussia a complement of 22,000 men. On 30 October, the King led the army out of Leipzig, toward Lützen, with Colonel Johann von Mayr and his &quot;Freibatallion&quot;, an independent unit of 1500 mixed troops, in the lead to flush out Allied pickets and reconnaissance parties; this cleared the way for the main army. The next day, Frederick moved out of Lützen at 3:00 pm, during heavy rain. Despite the weather, the Széchenyi Hussars harassed their line of march, but, in the hussars&#x27; eagerness to annoy the Prussians, they forgot to send a messenger to Weissenfels to warn the garrison of the Prussian approach. When Mayr appeared at about 8:00 a.m. on the 31st, followed by the King and the rest of his army, the French were completely surprised. The force there consisted of four battalions and 18 companies of grenadiers, all but three of them French: 5,000 men under command of Louis, Duke de Crillon.

Crillon closed up the town and prepared for action. The Prussians unlimbered their artillery and fired on the town gates; Mayr&#x27;s men and the Prussian grenadiers knocked out the obstructions. A few precise hits cleared their way into the town and the Allied resistance disappeared in cannon smoke; the Allied troops rapidly withdrew from the town across the bridge over the Saale and, as they withdrew, they set fire to the bridge to prevent the Prussians from following them. A conflagration consumed the wooden bridge so rapidly that 630 men, most of the garrison, were trapped on the wrong side. They surrendered with their arms and equipment. Saxe-Hildburghausen, at Burgwerben, ordered a barrage laid down across the Saale to prevent the Prussians from repairing the bridge. Frederick&#x27;s gunners responded in kind and the two shelled each other until about 3:00 pm.

While the artilleries kept up their noisy exchange, holding the Duke&#x27;s attention, Frederick sent scouts to find a decent crossing of the Saale, since the one at Weissenfels was unusable. There was little he could do at the burnt bridge; to cross the river under Saxe-Hildburghausen&#x27;s nose, in the face of fire, would have been foolish. Across the river, the Allies had a physical barrier to protect them; they could also use their position to watch Frederick&#x27;s movement. Inexplicably, though, Saxe-Hildburghausen gave up this advantage and retired toward Burgwerben and Tagewerben, counting on the intervening hills to protect him. Soubise had advanced from Reichardtswerben through Kaynau, and they met up at Großkorbetha. Their advanced guard patrolled Merseburg, and sought some information from the local inhabitants. Although the local Saxon peasants might have disliked the Prussians, they disliked the French and Austrian-allied &quot;Reichsarmee&quot; even more, and they gave up little information. Neither Saxe-Hildburghausen nor Soubise had an idea what Frederick intended, or indeed, what he was doing. Marshal Keith reached Merseburg and found the bridge there destroyed, with the Reichsarmee and French prepared to hold the other side of the river. By the night of 3November, Frederick&#x27;s engineers finished their new bridges and the entire Prussian line advanced across the Saale. As soon as Frederick had crossed the river, he sent 1,500 cavalry under the command of Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz to raid the Allied camp. He planned to attack it the next day, but the surprise raid frightened Soubise into moving during the night to a more secure position. On 4November, Frederick moved to his camp at Rossbach.

On the Allied side, the officers, both French and Reichsarmee, were frustrated by their superiors&#x27; timidity. Clearly, Frederick&#x27;s position was precarious, the Prussians outnumbered. One officer, Pierre-Joseph Bourcet convinced Soubise that they should attack Frederick in the morning, by swinging to Frederick&#x27;s left flank and cutting his line of retreat. This would, Bourcet thought, finish the campaign. After some persuasion Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen were convinced and everyone went to sleep. In the morning of 5November, some of the Allied troops went out to forage, and Soubise received a notice from Saxe-Hildburghausen, something to the effect of not a moment to be lost, we should advance, gain the heights and attack from the side. Until that point, Soubise had done nothing to rouse the French troops to action.

==Battle==
===Initial battlefield dispositions===
On the morning of 5November 1757 the Prussian camp lay between Rossbach on the left and the village of Bedra on the right, facing the Allies. Charles, the Prince Soubise, commanding the French, and the Prince Saxe-Hildburghausen, commanding the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s forces, had maneuvered in the preceding days without giving Frederick an opportunity to begin fighting. Their forces were located to the west, with their right flank near the town of Branderoda and their left at Mücheln. The advanced posts of the Prussians stood in villages immediately west of their camp, those of the Allies on the Schortau hill and the Galgenberg.

The Allies possessed a numerical superiority of two to one, and their advanced post, commanded by Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain, overlooked all parts of Frederick&#x27;s camp. The French and Habsburg Imperial (&quot;Reichsarmee&quot;) troops consisted of 62 battalions (31,000 infantry), 84 squadrons (10,000) of cavalry, and 109 artillery, totaling some 41,110 men, under Soubise&#x27;s and Saxe-Hildburghausen&#x27;s command. The Allies had taken the lead in the maneuvers of the previous days, and Saxe-Hildburghausen decided to take the offensive. He had some difficulty inducing Soubise to risk a battle, so the Allies did not begin to move from their campground until after eleven a.m. on 5November. Soubise probably intended to engage as late in the day as possible, with the idea of gaining what advantages he could in a partial action before nightfall. Their plan called for the Allied army to march by Zeuchfeld, around Frederick&#x27;s left, which no serious natural obstacle covered, and to deploy in battle array facing north, between Reichardtswerben on the right and Pettstädt on the left. Saxe-Hildburghausen&#x27;s proposed battle and the more limited aim of Soubise appeared equally likely to succeed by taking this position, which threatened to cut Frederick off from a retreat to the towns on the Saale. The Allies could attain this position only by marching around the Prussian flank, which could put them in the tenuous position of marching across their enemies&#x27; front. Consequently, the Allies posted a sizable guard against the obvious risk of interference on their exposed flank.

On the other side, Frederick commanded 27 battalions of infantry (17,000 men) and 43 squadrons of cavalry (5,000 horse), plus 72 companies of artillery, for a total of 22,000 men. He also had several of the siege guns from Leipzig, which arrived late in the morning. He spent the morning watching the French from the Goldacker manor rooftop in Rossbach. The initial stages of Allied movement convinced him that the Allies had started retreating southward towards their magazines; he sent out patrols to learn from the peasants what could be gleaned. They reported back that Soubise had taken the Weissenfels road; it led not only to that village, but also toward Freiburg, where Soubise could find supplies, or to Merseburg, where they would cut the Prussians off from the Saale. At about noon Frederick went to dinner, leaving the young captain Friedrich Wilhelm von Gaudi to observe French movements. Two hours later, his watch captain reported the French approaching. Although Gaudi&#x27;s excited report at first appeared to confirm a French-Reichsarmee retreat, Frederick observed that Allied columns, which from time to time became visible in the undulations of the ground, appeared to turn eastwards from Zeuchfeld. When Frederick saw for himself that hostile cavalry and infantry were already approaching Pettstädt, he realized his enemy&#x27;s intentions: to attack him in the flank and rear, and break his communications line, if not crush him completely. They now offered him the battle for which he had maneuvered in vain, and he accepted it without hesitation.

===Opening moves===
Frederick realized the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00 pm, the entire Prussian army had struck camp, loaded their tents and gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry and moved toward the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichardtswerben. Except for a few moments, the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller&#x27;s battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry&#x27;s left and the cavalry&#x27;s right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain&#x27;s advanced post.

Although aware of some of these movements, Soubise thought the Prussians were in full retreat. He ordered his advanced guard to hasten toward the Janus hill, but he issued no instructions on where, how and when to deploy. The Allied infantry moved in three long columns: at the head were the French regiments of Piedmont and Mailly, and on the flanks and in front of the right column were two regiments of Austrian cuirassiers and the Imperial cavalry. Ten French squadrons remained in reserve and twelve others protected the left flank. Soubise, who undoubtedly knew better, ordered no ground reconnaissance and sent no advanced guard. His army marched blindly into Frederick&#x27;s clutches.

===Trap===
When the Prussians broke camp, they left a handful of light troops to demonstrate before the French advance post commanded by the Comte de Saint-Germain. These light troops constituted the flank guard on the Schartau hill, which lay at right angles to the Janus and Pölzen. Frederick had no intention of either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit twice as fast as the Allies&#x27; army. If, at the moment of contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.

The Allies marched in normal order in two main columns, the first line on the left, the second line on the right; farther to the right, though, marched a column consisting of the foot reserve, and between the first and second lines trundled the reserve artillery. The right wing cavalry advanced at the head and the left wing cavalry at the tail of the two main columns. Noting some Prussian movement, Soubise ordered a wheeling pivot to the east, a complicated maneuver under parade-ground conditions, and difficult in the field, with troops unfamiliar with each other, on uneven terrain. At first, the columns retained regulation distance, wheeling eastward toward Zeuchfeld, but then part of the reserve infantry moved between the two main columns, hampering the movements of the reserve artillery. In addition, the troops on the outer flank of the wheel found themselves unable to keep up with the overly rapid movement of the inner pivot.

Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen ignored the confusion as their own troops struggled in the wheeling pivot. From their vantage point, it appeared to the Allied commanders that the Prussians were moving eastward; Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen presumed that the Prussians were about to retreat in order to avoid being taken in their flank and rear. The Allied generals hurried the march, sending on the leading (right wing) cavalry towards Reichardtswerben. They also called up part of the left wing cavalry from the tail of the column and even the flank guard cavalry to take part in what they presumed would be the general chase. Any semblance of the wheeling pivot was lost in these fresh maneuvers, and the remaining columns lost all cohesion and order.

Moller&#x27;s artillery on Janus hill again opened fire on this confusion of men and horses at 3:15 pm. When they came under the fire of Moller&#x27;s guns, the Allied cavalry, which now lay north of Reichardtswerben and well ahead of their own infantry, suffered from the barrage, but the commanders were not particularly concerned about the display of cannon fire. It was usual to employ heavy guns to protect a retreat, so the Allies assured themselves that Frederick was retreating and contented themselves with bringing some of their field guns into action. The cavalry hurried to get themselves out of range, but this further disorganized the Allied infantry lines, and caused any remaining unit cohesion to break down.

Unseen by the Allies, Seydlitz assembled his cavalry into two lines, one of 20 squadrons and the second of 18, and reduced the speed of his approach until they reached the screening ridge of the Pölzen hill. There, they waited. Seydlitz sat at the head of the lines, calmly smoking his pipe. When the Allied cavalry came within striking distance, 1000 paces from the crest of the ridge, he tossed his pipe in the air: this was the signal to charge. At 3:30 pm, Seydlitz crested the hill and his first 20 squadrons descended on the Allied army; the leading Allied cuirassiers managed to deploy to meet Seydlitz&#x27;s squadrons, but the momentum of the Prussian attack penetrated the Allied lines and wrought havoc among the disorganized mass. Prussian cavalry rode flank to flank; their training had taught them to form a line three and four deep from a column without breaking pace; once formed into a line, the troopers rode with knees touching, the horses&#x27; flanks touching, and horses riding tail to nose. Any attack of Prussian cavalry on open ground meant a line of horses—big Trakehners—bearing down on infantry or cavalry columns, lines, or squares. The horsemen could maneuver at a full gallop, to the left or right, or in an oblique.

The fighting soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, receiving a severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still waiting at the Janus, into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an oblique angle. The &quot;mêlée&quot; drifted rapidly southward, past the Allied infantry. Part of the Allied reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring to catch up with the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but the sweep of horses and Allied infantry pulled them into the fighting. The Allied reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in echelon from the left. Those Allied units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry&#x27;s infantry. Attempted French counterattacks dissolved into confusion. Most of the Allied cavalry units in front were smashed by the initial charge and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field was littered with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.

Seydlitz recalled his cavalry. This in itself was unusual: normally, a cavalry attacked once, maybe twice, and spent the rest of the battle chasing fleeing troops. Seydlitz led his rallied force toward the flank and rear of the Allied army, about out of the fighting and into a copse of trees between Reichardtswerben and Obschutz. There, horses and men could catch their breath. The Allies, relieved to see the last of the horsemen, became preoccupied with the Prussian infantry, about four battalions of it, threatening in linear formation to their left. Instead of forming into a similar line of attack, though, the Allied battalions formed into columns, fixed their bayonets and marched forward, prepared for a charge.

As the Allies advanced, not yet in bayonet range, they came within range of Prince Henry&#x27;s infantry; disciplined Prussian volleys shredded the orderly Allied columns. Then Moller&#x27;s artillery, reinforced by siege guns from Leipzig, tore some additional gaps. The leading ranks faltered; the following ranks crowded into them, goaded on by their officers. Prince Henry&#x27;s infantry advanced, still firing. Finally, seemingly out of nowhere, Seydlitz brought his cavalry in a flanking attack, this time all 38 squadrons in a massed attack; their sudden and energetic appearance at the flank and rear caused havoc and despair among the already demoralized &quot;Reichsarmee&quot; units assembled there. Three regiments of Franconian Imperial troops threw aside their muskets and ran, and the French ran with them. Seydlitz&#x27;s troopers pursued and cut down the fleeing Allies until darkness made the chase impossible.

=== Aftermath ===
The battle had lasted less than 90 minutes and the last episode of the infantry fight no more than fifteen minutes. Only seven Prussian battalions had engaged with the enemy, and these had expended five to fifteen rounds per man.

Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen, who had been wounded, succeeded in keeping one or two regiments together, but the rest scattered over the countryside. The French and Imperial troops lost six generals, an unusually high count in eighteenth century warfare, although not surprising given the emphasis on cavalry action in this battle. Among the French and German Imperial troops, the Austrian demographer Gaston Bodart counted 1,000 dead (including six generals) and approximately 3,500 wounded (including four generals), for a total of 8.3% wounded or dead, and 12.2% (approximately 5,000) missing or captured. Other historians might place the numbers of captured higher, at almost one third, or about 13,800. The Prussians took as trophies 72 cannons (62% of the Allied artillery), seven flags, and 21 standards. The Prussians captured eight French generals and 260 officers.

Prussian losses are more controversial: Frederick boasted of negligible casualties. In his thorough study of regimental histories, Bodart counted 169–170 Prussian dead (including seven officers), and 430 wounded (including Prince Henry, Seydlitz and two other generals, and 19 officers), or about 2.4% of the total Prussian force; these casualties amount to less than 10% of the engaged Prussian force. Other recent sources agree that the Prussians lost as few as 300 and as many as 500 among the wounded. In an assessment of surviving regimental records, modern sources place Prussian losses at even fewer than Bodart did: one colonel was killed, plus two other officers, and 67 soldiers.

Soubise has historically taken the blame for the loss, but this may be an unfair assessment. While he did owe his rank to his good relationship with Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV, he was neither blessed with extraordinary military acumen nor with the best troops: he could do nothing about the former, and most of the latter were with Louis Charles César Le Tellier, fighting in the Rhineland. Under Soubise&#x27;s command, the French had conducted a notorious march across Germany, characterized by persistent pillaging. His army also had approximately 12,000 civilian camp followers. There were chefs, hair dressers, perruquiers, barbers, wives and mistresses, pastry chefs, tailors and clothiers of all kinds, saddle makers, bridle makers, grooms, and servants of all varieties who served the nobility. In addition, the army had its usual motley crew of farriers, grooms, veterinarians, surgeons, and cooks that sustained an army on the march. After the battle, the Comte de Saint-Germain, who had commanded the advanced guard and also the rear guard that struggled to keep up with the fleeing army, complained that the troops in his charge had been defective, a gang of robbers, murderers, and cowards who ran at the sound of a gunshot.

The Imperial army, although smaller, was not much better, and certainly not the battle-hardened army the Prussians had faced at Kolín. This was the &quot;Reichsarmee&quot;, an army consisting of units sent by the constituent members of the Holy Roman Empire. Their commander had reported that they were defective in training, administration, armaments, discipline and leadership. The same might be said of their commander, Saxe-Hildburghausen, an indolent and slow-moving man. The Imperial regimental officers often lacked even basic garrison training. These units had little experience working together, much less fighting together, a problem that expressed itself most evidently in the disastrous wheeling pivot. Furthermore, the &quot;Reichsarmee&quot; contingents came from many principalities, some of which were Protestant, and many of which were unhappy about any alliance with the French; most were more adverse to the French than they were to the Prussians. Once news of the battle&#x27;s uneven resolution spread, some Germans felt satisfaction; the battle could be seen as retribution for the years of suffering under the French atrocities in the Rhineland and Palatinate during the wars of Louis XIV like the Nine Years&#x27; War. Mostly, though, Rossbach was significant for the strengthening of Prussia&#x27;s relationship with Frederick&#x27;s uncle, King George, and George&#x27;s other subjects. The British could now see the advantage of keeping the French occupied on the Continent while they continued their offensives against French territories in North America.

While Frederick was engaging the combined Allied forces further west, that autumn the Austrians had slowly retaken Silesia: Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine had captured the city of Schweidnitz and moved on Breslau in lower Silesia. While heading back to Silesia, Frederick learned of the fall of Breslau (22 November). He and his 22,000 men reversed tracks, and covered from Rossbach to Leuthen (now Lutynia, Poland), west of Breslau in twelve days. On the way, at Liegnitz, they joined with the Prussian troops who had survived the fighting at Breslau. The augmented army of about 33,000 troops arrived at Leuthen to find 66,000 Austrians in possession. Despite his troops&#x27; exhaustion from the rapid march from Rossbach, Frederick won yet another decisive victory at Leuthen.

==Assessment==
After the battle, Frederick reportedly said: &quot;I won the battle of Rossbach with most of my infantry having their muskets shouldered.&quot; This was indeed true: less than twenty-five percent of his entire force had been engaged. Frederick had discovered the use of operational maneuvers and with a fraction of his entire force—3,500 horsemen, 18 artillery pieces, and three battalions of infantry—had defeated an army of two of the strongest European powers. Frederick&#x27;s tactics at Rossbach became a landmark in the history of the military arts.
Rossbach also highlighted the extraordinary talents of two of Frederick&#x27;s officers, the artillery colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller and his cavalry general, Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz. Both men possessed the much-coveted &quot;coup d&#x27;œil militaire&quot;, the ability to discern at one glance the tactical advantages and disadvantages of the terrain. This attribute allowed them to use the artillery and cavalry to full potential. Frederick himself called this &quot;[T]he perfection of that art to learn at one just and determined view the benefits and disadvantages of a country where posts are to be placed and how to act upon the annoyance of the enemy. This is, in a word, the true meaning of a &quot;coup d&#x27;œil&quot;, without which an officer may commit errors of the greatest consequence.&quot; On the morning of the battle Frederick had passed over two senior generals and placed Seydlitz in command of the whole of his cavalry, much to those men&#x27;s annoyance and to Seydlitz&#x27; satisfaction. Seydlitz had spent the interim of the peace (1748–1756) training the cavalry to perform at optimum speed and force. The other outstanding officer, Colonel Moller, had invested the interim in developing a highly mobile artillery force. His artillery engineers were trained similarly to dragoons, to ride to a battle and fight dismounted; in the case of the artillery, they dragged their guns around the battlefield as needed. This was not yet the flying artillery that Frederick developed later, but it was similar in structure and function. Later developments refined the training and usage.

Furthermore, the battle was one instance in which Moller&#x27;s and Seydlitz&#x27;s awareness of Frederick&#x27;s operational objectives led to battlefield success. For example, not content with the single attack and recall, the &quot;coup de main&quot;, Seydlitz withdrew his squadrons into a copse, where they regrouped under cover of the trees. When the moment was right, he led his cavalry forward again in the &quot;coup de grâce&quot;, the finishing blow. Similarly, Moller&#x27;s artillery waited on the reverse angle of the hill until the French were in range, then mounted the Janus and laid down a thorough and precise pattern of artillery fire; the concussion of Moller&#x27;s thorough cannonade could be felt several miles away. Rossbach proved that the column as a means of tactical deployment on battlefield was inferior to the Prussian battle line; the massed columns simply could not hold in the face of either Moller&#x27;s fire or Seydlitz&#x27;s cavalry charges. The greater the formation of men, the greater the loss of life and limb.

The stunning victory at the Battle of Rossbach marked a turning point in alliances of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Britain increased its financial support for Frederick. French interest in the so-called Prussian war declined sharply after the Rossbach debacle and, with the signing of the Third Treaty of Versailles in March 1759, France reduced its financial and military contributions to the Coalition, leaving Austria on its own to deal with Prussia in Central Europe. The French continued their campaign against Hanover and Prussia&#x27;s Rhineland territories, but the Army of Hanover—commanded by one of Frederick&#x27;s finest officers, Ferdinand of Brunswick—kept them tied down in western Germany for the rest of the war.

==Battlefield today==
From 1865 to 1990, the area was mined for lignite. The extensive open-cast mining operations caused fundamental changes in the landscape and the population: a total of 18 settlements and some 12,500 people were resettled over the time of the mining and manufacturing. Residents of Rossbach itself were resettled in 1963 and most of the town was destroyed by mining operations that same year. Today, most of the battlefield is covered in some farmland, vineyards and a nature park created from flooding the old lignite mine with water; the resulting lake has a surface area of ; at its deepest point, the lake is deep. In the course of filling the old pit, paleontologists found fossils 251–243 million years old.

Four separate monuments dedicated to the battle were erected in the town of Reichardtswerben. The first monument was erected 16 September 1766, in gratitude to God for sparing the town of Reichardtswerben during the battle. The stone at Burgwerben castle was erected 9July 1844, and bears the following inscription:
 Before the Battle of Rossbach, on 5November 1757, Joseph Marie Friedrich Wilhelm Hollandius, Prinz von Sachsen-Hildburghausen, commandant of the German Reichsarmee in the Seven Years&#x27; War, established his headquarters in this castle. From this location, he gave the order on 31 October 1757 to burn the Saale bridge at Weissenfels.
After the Battle of Rossbach on 5November 1757, at six o&#x27;clock in the evening, the King of Prussia Frederick II, the Great, with only a small entourage, arrived at the castle. All rooms were occupied by wounded officers. His Majesty would not allow any of the [wounded] officers to be disturbed, and set up his field bed in an alcove and, after giving the orders for the day, spent the night there. The owner at that time was Superintendent Funcke; his grandson, Hauptmann [Franz Leopold] von Funcke, organized this in his memory.
Schloss Burgwerben the 9July 1844, Franz Leopold v. Funcke. 
K2169, the county highway passing through Reichardtswerben, is named &quot;Von-Seydlitz-Straße&quot;.

<text>Vebjørn Tandberg (16 September 1904–30 August 1978) was a Norwegian electronics engineer.

Tandberg was born at Bodø in Nordland, Norway. He attended the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim (1930).
He founded &quot;Tandbergs Radiofabrikk&quot; of Oslo in 1933 and made it a great success.
In addition to his technical and commercial achievements, Tandberg was a pioneer in providing good conditions for his workforce. He instituted a 42-hour week and three weeks&#x27; annual vacation for all in 1937, and a free pension and health insurance scheme for all from 1938. A four-week vacation for all employees over 40 years of age was introduced in 1947, while the working week was reduced to 39 hours in 1948. There was a five-day work week during the summer months from 1955, over the full year from 1969.

His life ended under tragic circumstances—suicide—after financial problems at the radio factory and the ensuing political maneuverings had left him without control so that he was frozen out from his life&#x27;s work. Subsequently, Tandbergs Radiofabrikk declared bankruptcy and underwent corporation reorganization .

<text>Niels Fabian Helge von Koch (25 January 1870 – 11 March 1924) was a Swedish mathematician who gave his name to the famous fractal known as the Koch snowflake, one of the earliest fractal curves to be described.

He was born to Swedish nobility. His grandfather, Nils Samuel von Koch (1801–1881), was the Chancellor of Justice. His father, Richert Vogt von Koch (1838–1913) was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Life Guards of Horse of the Swedish Army. He was enrolled at the newly created Stockholm University College in 1887 (studying under Gösta Mittag-Leffler), and at Uppsala University in 1888, where he also received his bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;filosofie kandidat&quot;) since the non-governmental college in Stockholm had not yet received the rights to issue degrees. He received his PhD in Uppsala in 1892. He was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm in 1905, succeeding Ivar Bendixson, and became professor of pure mathematics at Stockholm University College in 1911.

Von Koch wrote several papers on number theory. One of his results was a 1901 theorem proving that the Riemann hypothesis implies what is now known to be the strongest possible form of the prime number theorem.

He described the Koch curve in a 1904 paper entitled (&quot;On a continuous curve without tangents constructible from elementary geometry&quot;).

He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900 in Paris with talk (&quot;On the distribution of prime numbers&quot;) and in 1912 in Cambridge, England, with talk &quot;On regular and irregular solutions of some infinite systems of linear equations&quot;.

<doc id="194806" wikidata="Q1752939" url="?curid=194806" title="Independent agencies of the United States federal government">
<text>In the United States federal government, independent agencies are agencies that exist outside the federal executive departments (those headed by a Cabinet secretary) and the Executive Office of the President. In a narrower sense, the term refers only to those independent agencies that, while considered part of the executive branch, have regulatory or rulemaking authority and are insulated from presidential control, usually because the president&#x27;s power to dismiss the agency head or a member is limited.

Established through separate statutes passed by Congress, each respective statutory grant of authority defines the goals the agency must work towards, as well as what substantive areas, if any, over which it may have the power of rulemaking. These agency rules (or regulations), when in force, have the power of federal law.

==Executive and regulatory agencies==
Independent agencies exist outside the federal executive departments (those headed by a Cabinet secretary) and the Executive Office of the President. There is a further distinction between independent executive agencies and independent &quot;regulatory&quot; agencies, which have been assigned rulemaking responsibilities or authorities by Congress. The Paperwork Reduction Act lists 19 enumerated &quot;independent regulatory agencies&quot;, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Generally, the heads of independent regulatory agencies can only be removed for cause, but Cabinet members and heads of independent executive agencies, such as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, serve &quot;at the pleasure of the president&quot; and can be removed without cause.

The degree to which the President has the power to use executive orders to set policy for independent executive agencies is disputed. Many orders specifically exempt independent agencies, but some do not. Executive Order 12866 has been a particular matter of controversy; it requires cost-benefit analysis for certain regulatory actions.

===Structure of regulatory agencies===
Independent agencies can be distinguished from the federal executive departments and other executive agencies by their structural and functional characteristics. Their officers can be protected from removal by the president, they can be controlled by a board that cannot be appointed all at once, and the board can be required to be bipartisan.

Presidential attempts to remove independent agency officials have generated most of the important Supreme Court legal opinions in this area. In 1935, the Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Humphrey&#x27;s Executor v. United States&quot; decided that although the president had the power to remove officials from agencies that were &quot;an arm or an eye of the executive&quot;, it upheld statutory limitations on the president&#x27;s power to remove officers of administrative bodies that performed quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial functions, such as the Federal Trade Commission. Presidents normally do have the authority to remove regular executive agency heads at will, but they must meet the statutory requirements for removal of commissioners of independent agencies, such as demonstrating incapacity, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or other good cause.

While most executive agencies have a single director, administrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States, independent agencies (in the narrower sense of being outside presidential control) almost always have a commission, board, or similar collegial body consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. (This is why many independent agencies include the word &quot;Commission&quot; or &quot;Board&quot; in their name.) The president appoints the commissioners or board members, subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve terms that are staggered and longer than a four-year presidential term, meaning that most presidents will not have the opportunity to appoint all the commissioners of a given independent agency. In addition, most independent agencies have a statutory requirement of bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members of his own political party. The president can normally designate which commissioner will serve as the chairperson.

Congress can designate certain agencies explicitly as &quot;independent&quot; in the governing statute, but the functional differences have more legal significance. In reality, the high turnover rate among these commissioners or board members means that most presidents have the opportunity to fill enough vacancies to constitute a voting majority on each independent agency commission within the first two years of the first term as president. In some famous instances, presidents have found the independent agencies more loyal and in lockstep with the president&#x27;s wishes and policy objectives than some dissenters among the executive agency political appointments.

Although Congress can pass statutes limiting the circumstances under which the president can remove commissioners of independent agencies, if the independent agency exercises any executive powers like enforcement, and most of them do, Congress cannot reserve removal power over executive officers to itself. Constitutionally, Congress can only remove officers through impeachment proceedings. Members of Congress cannot serve as commissioners on independent agencies that have executive powers, nor can Congress itself appoint the commissioners – the Appointments Clause of the Constitution vests that power in the president. The Senate does participate, however, in appointments through &quot;advice and consent&quot;, which occurs through confirmation hearings and votes on the president&#x27;s nominees.

==Examples of independent agencies==
These agencies are not represented in the cabinet and are not part of the Executive Office of the president:
* Amtrak (National Railroad Passenger Corporation) is a passenger railroad service that provides intercity service throughout the contiguous United States and parts of Canada.
* The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gathers foreign intelligence and provides national security assessments to policymakers in the United States. It acts as the primary human intelligence provider for the federal government. It is one of the principal members of the Intelligence Community, which is overseen by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which is itself an independent agency.
* The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB), investigates industrial and chemical accidents and safety hazards.
* The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates commodity futures and option markets in the United States. The agency protects market participants against manipulation, abusive trade practices, and fraud. Through oversight and regulation, the CFTC enables the markets to serve better their important functions in the US economy, providing a mechanism for price discovery and a means of offsetting price risk.
* The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. Its jurisdiction includes banks, credit unions, securities firms, payday lenders, mortgage-servicing operations, foreclosure relief services, debt collectors, other financial companies in the United States.
* The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) evaluates and promotes the safety of consumer products.
* The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was formed in 2002 to serve as a national clearinghouse and resource of information regarding election administration. It is charged with administering payments to states and developing guidance to meet the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requirements, adopting voluntary voting system guidelines, and accrediting voting system test laboratories and certifying voting equipment. It is also charged with developing and maintaining a national mail voter registration form.
* The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) works with state and local governments throughout the United States to control and abate environmental pollution and to address problems related to solid waste, pesticides, radiation, and toxic substances. The EPA sets and enforces standards for air, soil and water quality, evaluates the impact of pesticides and chemical substances, and manages the Superfund program for cleaning toxic waste sites.
* The Export–Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) is the official export credit agency (ECA) of the United States federal government. Operating as a wholly owned federal government corporation, the bank &quot;assists in financing and facilitating U.S. exports of goods and services&quot;, particularly when private sector lenders are unable or unwilling to provide financing.
* The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. It licenses radio and television broadcast stations, assigns radio frequencies, and enforces regulations designed to ensure that cable rates are reasonable. The FCC regulates common carriers, such as telephone and telegraph companies, as well as wireless telecommunications service providers.
* The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides deposit insurance to depositors in U.S. commercial banks and savings banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act, enacted during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system. Member banks&#x27; insurance dues are the primary source of funding.
* The Federal Election Commission (FEC) oversees campaign financing for all federal elections. The commission oversees election rules as well as reporting of campaign contributions by the candidates.
* The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is the United States federal agency with jurisdiction over interstate electricity sales, wholesale electric rates, hydroelectric licensing, natural gas pricing, and oil pipeline rates. FERC also reviews and authorizes liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, interstate natural gas pipelines, and non-federal hydropower projects.
* The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) regulates Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks.
* The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) regulates the international ocean transportation of the United States. It is charged with ensuring a competitive and efficient ocean transportation system.
* The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) created in 1947, is an independent agency whose mission is to preserve and promote labor-management peace and cooperation. Headquartered in Washington, DC, with six regions comprising more than 60 field and home offices, the agency provides mediation and conflict resolution services to industry, government agencies and communities.

* The Federal Reserve System (often called &quot;the Fed&quot;), is the central bank of the United States. It conducts the nation&#x27;s monetary policy by influencing the volume of credit and money in circulation. The Federal Reserve regulates private banking institutions, works to contain systemic risk in financial markets, and provides certain financial services to the federal government, the public, and financial institutions.
* The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) is one of the smaller Executive Branch agencies, with just over 100 employees. It was established to administer the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), which provides federal employees the opportunity to save for additional retirement security. The Thrift Savings Plan is a tax-deferred defined contribution plan similar to a private sector 401(k) plan.
* The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces federal antitrust and consumer protection laws by investigating complaints against individual companies initiated by consumers, businesses, congressional inquiries, or reports in the media. The commission seeks to ensure that the nation&#x27;s markets function competitively by eliminating unfair or deceptive practices.
* The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for the purchase, supply, operation, and maintenance of federal property, buildings, and equipment, and for the sale of surplus items. GSA also manages the federal motor vehicle fleet and oversees remote work centers and civilian child care centers.
* The International Trade Commission (ITC) provides trade expertise to both the legislative and executive branches of the federal government, determines the impact of imports on US industries, and directs actions against certain unfair trade practices, such as patent, trademark, and copyright infringement.
* The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is the federal government&#x27;s space agency. It is responsible for the civilian space program as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.
* The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) preserves the nation&#x27;s history by overseeing the management of all federal records. The holdings of the National Archives include original textual materials, motion picture films, sound and video recordings, maps, still pictures, and computer data. The Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution, and the Bill of Rights are preserved and displayed at the National Archives building in Washington, D.C.
* The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), government backer of credit unions, equivalent to the FDIC.
* The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administers the principal United States labor law, the National Labor Relations Act. The board is vested with the power to prevent or remedy unfair labor practices and to safeguard employees&#x27; rights to organize and determine through elections whether to have a union as their bargaining representative.
* The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports fundamental research and education in all the non-medical fields of science and engineering.
* The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is responsible for civil transportation accident analysis in the US. The NTSB investigates and reports on aviation accidents and incidents, certain types of car accidents, ship and marine accidents, pipeline transport accidents, and rail transport accidents.
* The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was established by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 from the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and opened January 19, 1975. The NRC oversees reactor safety and security, reactor licensing and renewal, radioactive material safety, and spent fuel management (storage, security, recycling, and disposal).
* The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) is a permanent investigative and prosecutorial agency that operates a secure channel for federal whistleblower disclosures, protects federal employees from reprisal for whistleblowing, and enforces the restrictions of the Hatch Act on partisan political activity by government employees.
* The Peace Corps was created in 1961 by an executive order of President Kennedy, originally under the State Department but reorganized as an independent agency by President Nixon. Peace Corps&#x27; goal is to assist developing countries by providing skilled workers in fields such as education, health, entrepreneurship, women&#x27;s empowerment, or community development.
* The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) was created in 1971 as the Postal Rate Commission and strengthened under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act enacted in December 2006. Provides regulatory oversight over the activities of the United States Postal Service.
* The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was established to protect investors who buy stocks and bonds. Federal laws require companies that plan to raise money by selling their own securities to file reports about their operations with the SEC, so that investors have access to all material information. The commission has powers to prevent or punish fraud in the sale of securities and is authorized to regulate stock exchanges.
* The Selective Service System (SSS) is an independent federal agency operating with permanent authorization under the Military Selective Service Act. It is not part of the Department of Defense; however, it exists to serve the emergency manpower needs of the military by conscripting untrained men, or personnel with professional health care skills, if directed by Congress and the president. Its statutory missions also include being ready to administer an alternative service program, in lieu of military service for men classified as conscientious objectors.
* The Small Business Administration (SBA) was created in 1953 to advise, assist, and protect the interests of small business concerns. The SBA guarantees loans to small businesses, aids victims of floods and other natural disasters, promotes the growth of minority-owned firms, and helps secure contracts for small businesses to supply goods and services to the federal government.
* The Social Security Administration (SSA) is the United States federal agency that administers Social Security, a social insurance program consisting of retirement, disability, and survivors&#x27; benefits. To qualify for these benefits, most American workers pay Social Security taxes on their earnings; future benefits are based on employee contributions.
* The Surface Transportation Board (STB) was created in the ICC Termination Act of 1995 and is the successor agency to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The STB is an economic regulatory agency that Congress charged with resolving railroad rate and service disputes and reviewing proposed railroad mergers. The STB is decisionally independent, although it is administratively affiliated with the Department of Transportation.
* The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), created in 1933, provides economic development to the Tennessee Valley, a region particularly affected by the Great Depression.
* The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which provides foreign aid and assists with international development.
* The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) manages the United States federal civil service by providing federal human resources policy, oversight, and support, and tends to healthcare (FEHB), life insurance (FEGLI), and retirement benefits (CSRS and FERS, but not TSP) for federal government employees, retirees, and their dependents. It is headed by a director, who is nominated by the President.

* The United States Postal Service (USPS) is defined by statute as an &quot;independent establishment&quot; of the federal government, which replaced the Cabinet-level Post Office Department in 1971. The Postal Service is responsible for the collection, transportation, and delivery of the mails, and for the operation of thousands of local post offices across the country. It also provides international mail service through the Universal Postal Union and other agreements with foreign countries.
* The United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), which advances economic development and U.S. commercial interests in developing and middle income countries.

===Former agencies===
* The Committee on Public Information was an agency created to influence US public opinion regarding American participation in World War I. Lasting from April 14, 1917, to June 30, 1919 it was directed by George Creel. The agency used propaganda available to achieve its goals.
* The Interstate Commerce Commission regulated common carriers and was thus able to render far reaching orders, such as the desegregation of public transportation. After trucking and railroads were largely deregulated, the ICC was replaced with the independent Surface Transportation Board, with remaining functions transferred to the Department of Transportation.
* The United States Maritime Commission was intended to formulate a merchant shipbuilding program to design and build five hundred modern merchant cargo ships for the US Merchant Marine. It also formed the United States Maritime Service. In 1950, its functions were transferred to the United States Maritime Administration, which later became part of the Department of Transportation.
* The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was designed to help finance projects during the Great Depression. It later helped finance the nation&#x27;s military buildup as World War II approached. Scandals led to its eventual dissolution in 1956.
* The Atomic Energy Commission was established for peacetime development of atomic energy. In 1974 it was abolished, and two new agencies were created; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for regulation of civilian uses of nuclear materials, such as nuclear power plants and medical uses, and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) for military development of nuclear materials. In 1977, the ERDA was merged with the Federal Energy Administration to form the United States Department of Energy.
* The Office of the United States Nuclear Waste Negotiator was responsible for the placement and long term storage of radioactive waste. It was dissolved in 1995.
* The United States Information Agency, which was partially merged into the Department of State in 1999.

==Agencies outside of executive branch==
Although not officially part of the executive branch, these agencies are required by federal statute to release certain information about their programs and activities into the Federal Register, the daily journal of government activities:
* Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)
* Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)
* The National Gallery of Art
* The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is an independent establishment of the United States created by an act of Congress on August 10, 1846. The SI conducts scientific and scholarly research; publishes the results of studies, explorations, and investigations; organizes exhibits representative of the arts, the sciences, American history, and world culture; and engages in educational programming and national and international cooperative research. Most of the National Museums in Washington, D.C., are part of the Smithsonian.

==Proposed independent agencies==

* Federal Elections Agency, proposed by Lee Drutman of New America, which would merge the roles of the Federal Election Commission and Election Assistance Commission, expand enforcement against election interference and gather election data
* Weather Modification Operations and Research Board, proposed by Kay Bailey Hutchison to promote research into weather modification
* Nuclear Waste Administration, proposed by Lisa Murkowski to provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.

<text>A superminicomputer, colloquially supermini, is a high-end minicomputer. The term is used to distinguish the emerging 32-bit architecture midrange computers introduced in the mid to late 1970s from the classical 16-bit systems that preceded them. The development of these computers was driven by the need of applications to address larger memory. The term midicomputer had been used earlier to refer to these systems. Virtual memory was often an additional criteria that was considered for inclusion in this class of system. The computational speed of these machines was significantly greater than the 16-bit minicomputers and approached the performance of small mainframe computers. The name has at times been described as a &quot;frivolous&quot; term created by &quot;marketeers&quot; that lacks a specific definition. Describing a class of system has historically been seen as problematic: &quot;In the computer kingdom, taxonomic classification of equipment is more of a black art than a science.&quot; There is some disagreement about which systems should be included in this class. The origin of the name is uncertain.

As technology improved rapidly the distinction between minicomputer and superminicomputer performance blurred. Companies that sold mainframe computers began to offer machines in the same price and performance range as superminicomputers. By the mid-1980s microprocessors with the hardware architecture of superminicomputers were used to produce scientific and engineering workstations. The minicomputer industry then declined through the early 1990s. The term is now considered obsolete but still remains of interest for students/researchers of computer history.

== Notable companies ==
Notable manufacturers of superminicomputers in 1980 included: Digital Equipment Corporation, Perkin-Elmer, and Prime Computer. Other makers of systems included SEL/Gould and Data General. Four years later there were about a dozen companies producing a significant number of superminicomputers. 

Perkin-Elmer spun off their Data Systems Group in 1985 to form Concurrent Computer Corporation which continued making these systems. Nixdorf Computer, Norsk Data, and Toshiba also produced systems.

== Significant superminicomputers ==
* Interdata 7/32, 1974
* Digital Equipment Corporation VAX-11/780, 1978
* Prime Computer 750, 1979
* Data General Eclipse MV/8000, 1980
* IBM 4361, 1983
* IBM 9370, 1987

<text>Wyborowa (the feminine of the Polish adjective &quot;wyborowy&quot; &#x27;fine&#x27;) or Wódka Wyborowa is a brand of Polish vodka. The adjective was used in a favorable press article and then added after the word &quot;wódka&quot; &#x27;vodka&#x27;, resulting in the final name &quot;Wódka Wyborowa&quot;.

The product remained popular domestically until 1873 when the export of the vodka was started to the European countries. In 1927, Wyborowa became the first vodka brand to be an international trademark. In the 1950s and 60s, Wyborowa conquered all major European countries - it constituted over 60% of the total volume of vodka exported to the United Kingdom.

After the period of economic transition in the late 1980s and early 90s, the Poznań distillery, like many others in the country, got itself into serious trouble and was close to filing for bankruptcy protection. However, due to the large international popularity of its major product, the plant was bought by the French alcohol producer Pernod Ricard. 

Until 2009, Wyborowa was presented in 29 international competitions bringing - together with &quot;Wyborowa Exquisite&quot; (formerly &quot;Single Estate&quot;) in the Super Premium category - 29 medals including 22 gold. In addition, Wódka Wyborowa received the &quot;International High Quality Trophy&quot; at Monde Selection&#x27;s World Quality Selections in 2012. 

In 2017 Wyborowa introduced new series of products including Wyborowa od Mistrza and Dark - first black vodka.

==Production process==

Wyborowa is produced from rye grain, using a double-step distillation process. The rye is sent to small privately owned agricultural distilleries, where the rye is mashed and distilled once to produce &quot;raw spirit&quot;. 
When the rye arrives at the agricultural distillery, it is ground and then cooked within a large vessel using heated water from the distillery&#x27;s own source. The mixture is treated with enzymes that facilitate the hydrolysis of starch to glucose. Afterwards, it undergoes fermentation in stainless steel tanks. Once the fermentation has been completed, the resulting liquid is known as the ‘wash’ and has an alcoholic strength of between 7% and 11% ABV
The wash is distilled in a copper column still, yielding a spirit around 90% ABV. It takes 3 kg of rye to produce one litre of spirit. This &quot;raw spirit&quot; is then transferred to the rectification plant for further purification. 

The raw spirit passes through three columns of a continuous still to remove impurities.
Before Wyborowa is bottled, the rectified spirit needs to be reduced to the bottling strength of 40% ABV by diluting it with water from a dedicated spring. Once diluted, the vodka is passed through natural cellulose plates and mesh filters to remove particulate matter. Filtered vodka is pumped to the bottling line, where 5,000 bottles of Wyborowa are filled per hour. 

==Trivia==
The unique bottle shape was designed by architect Frank Gehry.
==Criticism==
In an analysis mandated by Swiss TV RTS in May 2014, the Eurofins Scientific group of laboratories reveals the presence of sugar cane or corn while Wyborowa&#x27;s labeling mentions rye alcohol only.

<text>Kjeller is a village located near Lillestrøm in the municipality of Lillestrøm, Norway. It is located 25 kilometers north-east of Oslo. 

==Name==
The Norse form of the name was probably &quot;Tjaldir&quot;. This is then the plural of &quot;tjald&quot; n &#x27;tent&#x27;. The hills around the farm (&quot;Kjellerhaugen&quot; and others) might have been compared in form with tents.

==Facilities==

Kjeller contains:

*Kjeller Airport
*Norwegian Defence Logistic Organization (&quot;FLO&quot;)
*The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (&quot;FFI&quot;)
*The Institute for Energy Technology (&quot;IFE&quot;), including one of Norway&#x27;s two nuclear research reactors.
*Norwegian Institute for Air Research
*The Norwegian Standardisation Bureau
*UNIK (University Graduate Center)
*Oslo Metropolitan University
*NORSAR (Norwegian Seismic Array) 

Historically, Kjeller has also been the location for a small aircraft factory. The Telenor Research Centre was located in Kjeller until 2001, when the majority of employees moved to Fornebu on 23 November. Akershus University College was opened in autumn 2003 at Telenor&#x27;s previous location. Approximately 3700 students attend the university.

The array at NORSAR was one of the first European nodes of the ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet.

===Nuclear reactor===
The nuclear reactor at Kjeller, opened on November 28, 1951 was the first reactor outside the US, Soviet Union, Canada, Great Britain and France. It was a joint project by the Dutch and Norwegian governments. The Netherlands supplied the uranium and Norway the heavy water. The nuclear reactor is used in scientific research and is together with a nuclear reactor in Halden Norway&#x27;s only two nuclear reactors. Neither of them is in commercial use.

On 9 September 2006, the reactor suffered a &quot;contained&quot; leak which forced it to shut down for three weeks for repairs. 

Its operating license expires at the end of 2018. In 2020 it was estimated dismantling the Halden and Kjeller research reactors and restoring the sites to unrestricted use will cost about NOK20 billion (US$2 billion) and take 20 to 25 years.

<doc id="194814" wikidata="Q332378" url="?curid=194814" title="Absolut Vodka">
<text>Absolut Vodka is a brand of vodka, produced near Åhus, in southern Sweden. Absolut is a part of the French group Pernod Ricard. Pernod Ricard bought Absolut for €5.63 billion in 2008 (equivalent to € in ) from the Swedish state. Absolut is one of the largest brands of spirits in the world (after Smirnoff and Bacardi) and is sold in 126 countries.

==History==

Absolut was established in 1879 by Lars Olsson Smith. Smith challenged the city of Stockholm&#x27;s liquor marketing monopoly with his vodka. It was sold outside the city border at a lower price than the monopoly&#x27;s product. Smith offered free boat rides to the distillery and (&quot;Pure Vodka&quot;) was highly successful.
In 1917, the Swedish government monopolized the country&#x27;s alcohol industry. Vodka was then sold nationwide under the name . In 1979, the old name Absolut was picked up when the upper-price range Absolut Vodka was introduced. &quot;Renat&quot; is the name of another vodka product sold by Pernod Ricard Sweden AB.

Absolut Vodka was introduced to the global market in 1979. Absolut sells over of vodka annually. The vodka is made from winter wheat and is produced now only in Åhus.
==Lars Olsson Smith==
Lars Olsson Smith was born in 1836 in Kiaby and died in 1913 in Karlskrona, Sweden. L.O. Smith was an entrepreneur, parliamentarian and founder of (&quot;Absolutely pure spirit&quot;). It was the inspiration for Absolut Vodka. L.O. Smith launched a method that removes contaminants such as glut in the spirits. L.O. Smith came from a peasant family in Blekinge and quickly made a career in the retail trade as a 6-year-old. He later moved to Stockholm and started manufacturing and selling vodka at his factory at Reimersholme.

==Advertising==
In the early 1980s in New York, Absolut Vodka was popular among the creative community. Absolut&#x27;s first advertising campaign was created by TBWA for the brand&#x27;s U.S. Importer, Carillon Importers, Ltd.

The brand has a long-running advertising campaign created by TBWA. The first of these ads, typical of the rest, was introduced in 1981 and featured a picture of the bottle with a halo over the cap above the slogan &quot;Absolut Perfection&quot;.

Absolut&#x27;s first advertising campaign ran for more than twenty-five years from its launch in 1980. The campaign has encompassed many different kinds of ads, such as art, fashion, cities, spectaculars, Hollywood, etc. The advertising has won hundreds of awards, including charter membership in the American Marketing Association&#x27;s Marketing Hall of Fame. Absolut was inducted into the Hall in 1992 along with just two other brands: Coca-Cola and Nike. Also in 1992, Freedom Rings were featured in the first gay-specific Absolut Vodka ad, entitled &quot;Absolut Spada&quot;.

In 1983, Carillon&#x27;s president and CEO Michel Roux approached the artist Andy Warhol, whom he paid $65,000 to create an advertisement for Absolut. Over the years, Carillon commissioned the work of well-known painters, graphic designers, fashion designers, as well as many up-and-coming artists. During the 2017 Corporate Art Awards Ceremony hosted by the President of the Italian Republic Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace, Absolut received by pptArt a special award &quot;for their long-running collaboration with 550 artists on 850 projects to shape their corporate image and brand&quot;. The talents included such names as Damien Hirst, Rosemarie Trockel, Helmut Newton, Javier Mariscal, Maurizio Cattelan, Louise Bourgeois, Alain Despert, and many, many more.

In 2005, Absolut invited American singer Lenny Kravitz to participate in its promotional campaign. The song &quot;Breathe&quot; was recorded and released. The song was remixed many times by various DJs.

In 2007, Absolut introduced its new global campaign, &quot;In An Absolut World&quot;, created by TBWA/Chiat/Day.

In 2008, an advertisement placed in Mexican publications and on Mexican billboards featured a map of the U.S. and Mexico with the boundaries between the two as they were prior to the 1836 Texas Revolution and the Mexican–American War. Media outlets reported on some American consumers&#x27; reactions at the advert&#x27;s perceived insensitivity to immigration issues.
Absolut responded that the adverts were purely whimsical, with no political or nationalist agenda, but its critics were adamant. Absolut later issued a public apology and withdrew the advert.

In 2009, Absolut debuted a campaign with renowned fashion photographer Ellen Von Unwerth and actresses Kate Beckinsale and Zooey Deschanel to celebrate different Absolut drinks.

In 2010 Absolut collaborated with Spike Jonze to create a short film entitled &quot;I’m here&quot;. The short film was screened at festivals such as Sundance Film Festival and Berlin Film Festival.

In 2012, Absolut partnered with Swedish House Mafia to create an original track and music video to promote Absolut Greyhound cocktail. &quot;Greyhound&quot;–which is the title of the drink, the video, and the actual music track–is a video created by TBWA\Chiat\Day, where three groups of racing enthusiasts converge on the Bonneville Salt Flats to watch robotic greyhounds speed across the plains, holding pink Absolut Greyhounds in their hands.

In 2013, Absolut launched the Global &#x27;Transform Today&#x27; Campaign by the creative agency, Sid Lee. The creative features four artists. Sid Lee recruited four international emerging artists to inspire younger generations. French artist, director and musician Woodkid, American digital media artist Aaron Koblin, fashion designer Yiqing Yin and Brazilian graphic novel artists Rafael Grampa is featured.

As part of this platform, Absolut launched the Absolut Creative Competition in 2018 which was an art competition. In May 2019 Absolut announced the global winner that was selected by global juries such as Mickalene Thomas, Aaron Cezar and Bose Krishnamachari. Sarah Saroufim from Lebanon was declared the winner from 7,500 entrants with her design.

==Controversies==
After pausing its production in Russia due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Pernod Ricard resumed the export of Absolut Vodka in April 2023, leading to widespread criticism in Sweden. As a result, Pernod Ricard decided to once again stop its operations in Russia.

<doc id="194815" wikidata="Q1933" url="?curid=194815" title="Anja Pärson">
<text>Anja Sofia Tess Pärson (; born 25 April 1981) is a Swedish former alpine skier. She is an Olympic gold medalist, seven-time gold medalist at the World Championships, and two-time overall Alpine Skiing World Cup champion. This included winning three gold medals in the 2007 World Championship in her native Sweden. She has won a total of 42 World Cup races.

==Biography==
Pärson was born in Umeå, Sweden and has Sámi roots. Pärson was introduced to ski racing by her sister, Frida, and is now trained by her father, Anders. Her first World Cup race was a giant slalom at the World Cup Finals at Crans-Montana, Switzerland (on 15 March 1998). She qualified for that race as the new junior World Champion but only finished 25th in last place. She won her first World Cup race, a slalom at Mammoth Mountain, California, in December 1998 at age 17, and her first gold medal at St. Anton, Austria, in 2001. She clinched the silver medal in the giant slalom and the bronze medal in the slalom at the 2002 Winter Olympics, and added the gold in slalom plus two more bronze medals in downhill and combined in 2006 Winter Olympics.

Pärson won the Alpine Skiing World Cup overall title in 2004 and 2005. The latter title was won by the smallest margin ever, only 3 points over her fierce rival, Janica Kostelić. Initially a slalom and giant slalom specialist, she won her first super-G and downhill races in March 2005 at San Sicario, Italy, during the pre-Olympic competitions. In total, she has won 42 World Cup races in all five disciplines.

Pärson has won seven gold medals in the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, in 2001 (slalom), 2003 (giant slalom), 2005 (giant slalom, super-G) and 2007 (super-G, super combined, downhill). These go along with two silver and three bronze medals in other events in 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2011. With her three gold medals in 2007 at Åre, Sweden, she became the first skier in history to win World Championship golds in all five disciplines.

Pärson has earned a total of 17 individual medals in World Championships and Olympics, exceeding the record by Christl Cranz in women&#x27;s alpine skiing. In men&#x27;s alpine skiing this achievement has been beaten only by Kjetil André Aamodt, with 20. After two disappointing seasons (2006/07 and 2007/08 where she finished fifth and sixth in the overall cup), she was back to her best over the 2008/09 season, finishing third in the overall cup.

At the 2010 Winter Olympics, while trying to chase down eventual downhill champion Lindsey Vonn of the United States, Pärson lost her balance on the last jump before the finish, resulting in a 60-metre flight and subsequent fall, without however suffering serious injury. She recovered from the fall and one day later won the bronze medal in the combined event.

With a downhill victory in March 2011, she has won at least one race for ten consecutive World Cup seasons, trailing only Alberto Tomba and Vreni Schneider who won races in eleven consecutive World Cup seasons, and equalling the mark of Renate Götschl, Ingemar Stenmark and Mikaela Shiffrin.

On 12 March 2012, Pärson officially announced her retirement, and that her last competition would be the World Cup final in Schladming the coming weekend.

In 2014 she became an expert commentator for Viasat during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

As of 2015, Pärson works as a sports expert for the broadcaster Sveriges Television,
in addition to running a company with her wife.

Pärson competes in the celebrity dance show Let&#x27;s Dance 2017 broadcast on TV4.

==Personal life==
Pärson&#x27;s athletics club is Fjällvinden, Tärnaby, the same to which skiing legend Ingemar Stenmark and Stig Strand belonged.

Her height is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in). She was awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in 2006 and in 2007.

After living several years in Monaco during her sports career, she returned to Sweden and has lived in Umeå since 2012.

In June 2012, Pärson announced on the Swedish radio program &quot;Sommar&quot; that she has been in a relationship with a woman, Filippa Rådin, for the past five years, and that they are expecting a child together. Their son, Elvis, was born on 4 July 2012. On 2 August 2014, Anja Pärson and Filippa married in Umeå, Sweden. Former Swedish Social Democratic Party leader Mona Sahlin officiated at the wedding. In January 2015, the couple announced that Pärson was pregnant with their second child, a boy named Maximilian who was born in May 2015.

<text>Ö, or ö, is a character that represents either a letter from several extended Latin alphabets, or the letter &quot;o&quot; modified with an umlaut or diaeresis. Ö, or ö, is a variant of the letter O. In many languages, the letter &quot;ö&quot;, or the &quot;o&quot; modified with an umlaut, is used to denote the close- or open-mid front rounded vowels or . In languages without such vowels, the character is known as an &quot;o with diaeresis&quot; and denotes a syllable break, wherein its pronunciation remains an unmodified .

== &quot;O&quot;-umlaut ==
The letter &quot;o&quot; with umlaut (&quot;ö&quot;) appears in the German alphabet. It represents the umlauted form of &quot;o&quot;, resulting in or . The letter is often collated together with &quot;o&quot; in the German alphabet, but there are exceptions which collate it like &quot;oe&quot; or &quot;OE&quot;. The letter also occurs in some languages that have adopted German names or spellings, but it is not normally a part of those alphabets. In Danish and Norwegian, &quot;ö&quot; was previously used in place of &quot;ø&quot; in older texts to distinguish between open and closed ö-sounds. It is also used when confusion with other symbols could occur, on maps for instance. The Danish/Norwegian &quot;ø&quot; is, like the German/Swedish &quot;ö&quot;, a development of &quot;oe&quot; and can be compared with the French &quot;œ&quot;.
In other languages that do not have the letter as part of the regular alphabet or in limited character sets such as ASCII, &quot;o&quot;-umlaut is frequently replaced with the digraph &quot;oe&quot;. For example, German (hear/listen) can be easily recognized even if spelled .

== &quot;Ö&quot; in other languages ==
The letter &quot;ö&quot; also occurs in two other Germanic languages: Swedish and Icelandic, but it is regarded there as a separate letter, not as an orthographic variation of the letter &quot;o&quot;. Apart from Germanic languages, it occurs in the Uralic languages such as Finnish, Karelian, Veps, Estonian, Southern Sami, and Hungarian, in the Turkic languages such as Azeri, Turkish, Turkmen, Uyghur (Latin script), Crimean Tatar, Kazakh, and in the Uto-Aztecan language Hopi, where it represents the vowel sounds . Its name in Finnish, Swedish, Icelandic, Estonian, Azeri, Turkish, Turkmen, Uyghur, Crimean Tatar, Hungarian, Votic and Volapük is &quot;Öö&quot; , not &quot;O with two dots&quot; since is not a variant of the vowel but a distinct phoneme.

In mountain dialects of Emilian, it is used to represent , e.g. &quot;tött&quot; &quot;all&quot;.

In the Germanic language of Limburgish, the (ö) is used for the short , similarly to German.

In certain languages, the letter &quot;ö&quot; cannot be written as &quot;oe&quot; because minimal pairs exist between &quot;ö&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; (and also with &quot;oo&quot;, &quot;öö&quot; and &quot;öe&quot;), as in Finnish &quot;eläinkö&quot; &quot;animal?&quot; (interrogative) vs. &quot;eläinkoe&quot; &quot;animal test&quot; (cf. Germanic umlaut). If the character &quot;ö&quot; is unavailable, &quot;o&quot; is substituted and context is relied upon for inference of the intended meaning. In Volapük, &quot;ö&quot; can be written as &quot;oy&quot;, but never as &quot;oe&quot;.

In Romagnol, &quot;ö&quot; is used to represent , e.g. &quot;cöt&quot; &quot;cooked&quot;.

In the Seneca language, &quot;ö&quot; is used to represent , a back mid rounded nasalized vowel.

In Swedish, the letter &quot;ö&quot; is also used as the one-letter word for an island, which is not to be mixed with the actual letter. &quot;Ö&quot; in this sense is also a Swedish-language surname.

In the Seri language, &quot;ö&quot; indicates the labialization of the previous consonant, e.g. &quot;cöihiin&quot; &quot;sanderling&quot;.

=== Alphabetical position ===
In some alphabets it is collated as an independent letter, sometimes by placing it at or near the end of the alphabet, such as after &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;Å&quot; and &quot;Ä&quot; in Swedish and Finnish, after &quot;Ý&quot;, (&quot;Z&quot;), &quot;Þ&quot; and &quot;Æ&quot; in Icelandic, and after &quot;V&quot;, (&quot;W&quot;), &quot;Õ&quot; and &quot;Ä&quot; in Estonian (thus fulfilling the place of omega, for example in the Finnish expression &quot;aasta ööhön&quot; &quot;from A to Z&quot;, literally &quot;from A to Ö&quot;. However, in Hungarian, and in the Turkish alphabet and other Turkic alphabets that have &quot;ö&quot;, it is an independent letter between &quot;o&quot; and &quot;p&quot;.

== &quot;O&quot;-diaeresis ==

&quot;O&quot; with diaeresis occurs in several languages that use diaereses. In these languages the letter represents the fact that this &quot;o&quot; is the start of a new syllable (e.g. in the Dutch/Afrikaans word [cooperative]), instead of the general &quot;oo&quot; (e.g. In the Dutch word [thorn]) .

=== In English ===

Some writers and publications, such as &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, use it in English words such as &quot;zoölogy&quot; and &quot;coöperate&quot; to indicate that the second vowel is pronounced separately. It is also employed in names such as &quot;Laocoön&quot;, Coös County, and the constellation &quot;Boötes&quot;. This is also done in Dutch.

== Usage in phonetic alphabets ==

In the Rheinische Dokumenta, a phonetic alphabet for many West Central German, the Low Rhenish, and few related vernacular languages, &quot;ö&quot; represents the close-mid front rounded vowel with the IPA notation .

The Uralic phonetic alphabet uses as in Finnish to denote the front vowel .

== Typography ==

Historically &quot;O&quot;-diaeresis was written as an &quot;o&quot; with two dots above the letter. O-umlaut was written as an &quot;o&quot; with a small &quot;e&quot; written above in cursive old German (Gothic) script (Oͤ oͤ): this minute &quot;e&quot; is represented by two vertical bars connected by a slanted line, which then degenerated to two vertical bars in early modern handwritings. In most later handwritings these bars in turn nearly became dots. The origin of the letter &quot;ö&quot; was a similar ligature for the digraph OE: &quot;e&quot; was written above &quot;o&quot; and degenerated into two small dots.

In some inscriptions and display typefaces, &quot;ö&quot; may be represented as an &quot;o&quot; with a small letter &quot;e&quot; inside.

In modern typography there was insufficient space on typewriters and later computer keyboards to allow for both an O-with-dots (also representing &quot;ö&quot;) and an &quot;o&quot;-with-bars. Since they looked nearly identical, the two glyphs were combined, which was also done in computer character encodings such as ISO 8859-1. As a result, there was no way to differentiate between the different characters.

Other alphabets containing &quot;o&quot;-diaeresis include the Welsh alphabet.

Other alphabets containing &quot;o&quot;-umlaut include: the Turkmen alphabet (for the vowel [ø]), the Azerbaijani alphabet (for the vowel [œ]), the Yapese alphabet (for [œ]), the Luxembourgish alphabet (when writing loanwords from Standard German), the Slovenian alphabet (when writing loanwords from German, Hungarian and Turkish), and the Dinka alphabet. The Hungarian alphabet contains both &quot;ö&quot; and &quot;ő&quot;: &quot;double acute o&quot; is the longer pair of &quot;ö&quot;. See double acute accent.

<text>Ä (lowercase ä) is a character that represents either a letter from several extended Latin alphabets, or the letter [[A]] with an umlaut mark or diaeresis. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, it represents the open central unrounded vowel.

==Usage==
=== Independent letter ===
The letter Ä occurs as an independent letter in the Swedish, German, Luxembourgish, North Frisian, Finnish, Estonian, Skolt Sami, Karelian, Saterlandic, Emilian, Rotuman, Slovak, Tatar, Kazakh, Gagauz, and Turkmen alphabets, where it represents a vowel sound. In Finnish, Kazakh, Turkmen and Tatar, this is always []; in Swedish and Estonian, regional variation, as well as the letter&#x27;s position in a word, allows for either or . In German and Slovak &quot;Ä&quot; stands for (or the archaic but correct ). In the romanization of Nanjing Mandarin, &quot;Ä&quot; stands for .
In the Nordic countries, the vowel sound was originally written as &quot;Æ&quot; when Christianisation caused the former Vikings to start using the Latin alphabet around A.D. 1100. The letter Ä arose in German and later in Swedish from originally writing the E in AE on top of the A, which with time became simplified as two dots, consistent with the Sütterlin script. In the Icelandic, Faroese, Danish and Norwegian alphabets, &quot;Æ&quot; is still used instead of Ä.

Finnish adopted the Swedish alphabet during the 700 years that Finland was part of Sweden. Although the idea of the Germanic umlaut does not exist in Finnish, the phoneme does. Estonian gained the letter through extensive exposure to German, with Low German throughout centuries of effective Baltic German rule, and to Swedish, during the 160 years of Estonia as a part of the Swedish Empire until 1721.

The letter is also used in some Romani alphabets.

===Emilian===
In Emilian ä is used to represent , occurring in some dialects, e.g. Bolognese &quot;good, well&quot; and &quot;people&quot;.

=== Kazakh ===

Under Kassym-Jomart Tokayev&#x27;s suggestions to modify the Kazakh Latin alphabet, it will represent the IPA //, and the Cyrillic Ә is to be replaced by this letter, the replacement letter was Á in the 2018 proposal.

=== Tatar ===
The Turkic Tatar language is written officially in the Cyrillic script, but a Latin based alphabet is in limited use. 

The Tatar Cyrillic letter ә [æ] has been usually transliterated as ä, but in 2024, the Common Turkic Alphabet replaced it with ə, which is also used in Azeri Latin script. Tatar activists writing in the Latin script on social media have preferred to use this instead of ä as well; the main argument being that ä is aesthetically less pleasing when Tatar already owns a lot of umlauts (күбәләкләр, kübäläklär, &quot;kübələklər&quot;; &#x27;butterflies&#x27;). 

In Finland, while ä is found in Finnish, the Tatar community has traditionally tried to use only letters found in Turkish, and thus, have replaced it with e. This has left both the [e] and [ɯ] (ı) sounds as ı (keçkenä / keçkenə, &quot;kıçkıne&quot;; &#x27;small&#x27;). Nowadays however the spelling has had more influence from Tatarstan. 

===Cyrillic===

Ӓ is used in some alphabets invented in the 19th century which are based on the Cyrillic script. These include Mari, Altay and the Keräşen Tatar alphabet.

=== Umlaut-A ===

A similar glyph, A with umlaut, appears in the German alphabet. It represents the umlauted form of &quot;a&quot; ( when short), resulting in (or for many speakers) in the case of the long and in the case of the short . In German, it is called (pronounced ) or . Referring to the glyph as is an uncommon practice, and would be ambiguous, as that term also refers to Germanic a-mutation. The digraph is used for the fronting diphthong (otherwise spelled with ) when it acts as the umlauted form of the backing diphthong (spelled ); compare &quot;Baum&quot; &#x27;tree&#x27; with &quot;Bäume&quot; &#x27;trees&#x27;. In German dictionaries, the letter is collated together with &quot;A&quot;, while in German phonebooks the letter is collated as &quot;AE&quot;. The letter also occurs in some languages which have adopted German names or spellings, but is not a part of these languages&#x27; alphabets. It has recently been introduced in revivalist Ulster-Scots writing.

The letter was originally an A with a lowercase e on top, which was later stylized to two dots.

In other languages that do not have the letter as part of the regular alphabet or in limited character sets such as US-ASCII, Ä is frequently replaced with the two-letter combination &quot;Ae&quot;.

=== Phonetic alphabets ===
*In the International Phonetic Alphabet, ä represents an open central unrounded vowel (in distinction to an open front unrounded vowel).
*in the Rheinische Dokumenta, a phonetic alphabet for many West Central German, Low Rhenish, and a few related languages, &quot;ä&quot; represents the sound .

=== Typography ===

Historically A-diaeresis was written as an &quot;A&quot; with two dots above the letter. A-umlaut was written as an &quot;A&quot; with a small &quot;e&quot; written above (Aͤ aͤ): this minute &quot;e&quot; degenerated to two vertical bars in medieval handwriting
(A̎ a̎). In most later handwritings these bars in turn nearly became dots.

Æ, a highly similar ligature evolving from the same origin as &quot;Ä&quot;, evolved in the Icelandic, Danish and Norwegian alphabets. The Æ ligature was also common in Old English, but had largely disappeared in Middle English.

In modern typography there was insufficient space on typewriters and later computer keyboards to allow for both A-diaeresis (also representing &quot;Ä&quot;) and A-umlaut. Since they looked near-identical the two glyphs were combined, which was also done in computer character encodings such as ISO 8859-1. As a result, there was no way to differentiate between the different characters. Unicode theoretically provides a solution, but recommends it only for highly specialized applications.

Ä is also used to substitute Ə (the letter schwa) in situations where that glyph is unavailable, as used in the Tatar and Azeri languages. Turkmen started to use Ä officially instead of the schwa from 1993 onwards.

<text>Zither (; , from the Greek &quot;cithara&quot;) is a class of stringed instruments. The modern instrument has many strings stretched across a thin, flat body.

Zithers are typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers or a plectrum. In the Hornbostel–Sachs classification system, the term refers to a larger family of similarly shaped instruments that also includes the hammered dulcimer family and piano and a few rare bowed instruments like the bowed psaltery, bowed dulcimer, and streichmelodion. Like an acoustic guitar or lute, a zither&#x27;s body serves as a resonating chamber (sound box), but, unlike guitars and lutes, a zither lacks a distinctly separate neck assembly. The number of strings varies, from one to more than fifty.

In modern usage the term &quot;zither&quot; usually refers to three specific instruments: the concert zither (), its variant the Alpine zither (each of which uses a fretted fingerboard), and the chord zither (more recently described as a fretless zither or &quot;guitar zither&quot;). Concert and Alpine zithers are traditionally found in Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, France, north-western Croatia, the southern regions of Germany, Alpine Europe, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Emigration from these areas during the 19th century introduced the concert and Alpine zither to North and South America. Chord zithers similar to the instrument in the photograph also became popular in North America during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These variants all use metal strings, similar to the cittern.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;zither&quot; is derived from Latin cythara, which was used in this form for the title covers on many 16th- and 17th-century German-printed manuscript books originally for the &#x27;cittern&#x27; – from the Greek word kithara, an instrument used in Ancient Greece. The German scholar Michael Praetorius mentions an Englishman who came to Germany with a small cittern, &quot;&quot;, in his treatise &quot;Syntagma Musicum&quot;, published during the early 17th century. It is not fully understood how &quot;zitter&quot; or &quot;zither&quot; came to be applied to the instruments in this article as well as German varieties of the cittern. Other types of zither also existed in Germany, mostly drone zithers like the scheitholt (which was mentioned by Praetorius) or hummel, but these generally have their own individual regional names and may have been in use before the introduction into the lexicon of &#x27;cythara&#x27; and its German derivative cognate.

== Organology ==
The Hornbostel–Sachs system, an academic instrument classification method, also uses the term &quot;zither&quot; to classify all stringed instruments in which the strings do not extend beyond the sounding box. Categories include Bar zithers (made up of musical bows and stick zithers), tube zithers, raft zithers, board zithers (includes box zithers, ground zithers and harp zithers), trough zithers and frame zithers.

According to Sachs,

The strings may be &quot;open&quot; or stopped, it may be a psaltery or a dulcimer.

This includes such diverse instruments as the hammered dulcimer, psaltery, Appalachian dulcimer, guqin, guzheng, tromba marina, koto, gusli, kanun, kanklės, kantele, kannel, kokles, valiha, gayageum, đàn tranh, autoharp, santoor, yangqin, santur, swarmandal, and others. Pedal steel guitars, lap guitars (where the neck serves no separate function other than to extend the string length), and keyboard instruments like the clavichord, harpsichord and piano also fall within this broad categorical use.

The word has also been used in conjunction with brand varieties of other string instruments, for example, the zither banjo.

==History and development==

The earliest known surviving instrument of the zither family is a Chinese guqin, a fretless instrument, found in the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng, dating from 433 BC. Similar instruments along this design were developed over the following centuries, for example, the Japanese silk-strung koto; the siter of Indonesian gamelans; the qānūn (or kanun) of Greece and the Middle East; the valiha, a tube zither of Madagascar; and many others. Increasing interest in &quot;world music&quot; has brought wider recognition to these other zither family members, both ancient and modern. Many of these instruments have been sampled electronically and are available in instrument banks for music synthesizers.
In Europe and other more northern and western regions, early zithers were more similar to the modern mountain dulcimer, having long, usually rectangular, sound boxes, with one or more melody strings and several unfretted drone strings. Some of these employed movable bridges similar to the Japanese koto, used for retuning the drone strings. The Alpine &quot;Scheitholt&quot; furnishes an example of this older type of European zither. By the late 18th century, two principal varieties of European concert zither had developed, known as the &quot;Salzburg zither&quot; (with a rounded side away from the player), and the &quot;Mittenwald zither&quot; (with both sides rounded). Both styles are still found in concert zithers today, although the Salzburg style has become by far the most common.

The zither became a popular folk music instrument in Bavaria and Austria and, at the beginning of the 19th century, was known as a &quot;&quot;.
Viennese zitherist Johann Petzmayer (1803–1884) became one of the outstanding virtuosi on these early instruments and is credited with making the zither a household instrument.
In 1838, Nikolaus Weigel of Munich conceived the idea of adopting fixed bridges, adding additional strings, tuning them in the cycle of fifths, and chromatically fretting the fingerboard – effectively converting a rather crude folk instrument into the concert zither. His ideas were not, however, widely accepted until 1862, when luthier Max Amberger of Munich fabricated a new zither based on Weigel&#x27;s design. At this point the zither had reached something very close to its modern concert form. Within a relatively short time the new design had largely replaced the old Volkszither (though still called by the same name among folk musicians) throughout central Europe, particularly in the Alpine countries. As the &#x27;concert zither&#x27; it also began to attract the attention of serious composers, a number of whom, themselves, became concert zither virtuosi. These composers, called the &quot;&quot;, flourished between 1870 and 1910. And no less a composer than Johann Strauss II gave the instrument a prominent solo in one of his most famous waltzes, &quot;Tales from the Vienna Woods&quot;.

The zither went through two periods of great popularity in the United States. The first of these was in the late 19th through early 20th century, when it was greatly in vogue as a parlour instrument in many homes. During that period, a number of U.S.-based instrument manufacturers, many of them founded by, or staffed with, European (and especially German and Austrian) luthiers, were producing concert zithers. Chord zithers were often marketed under confusing brand names like &#x27;guitar zither&#x27; or &#x27;mandoline zither&#x27;. The recently rediscovered recordings of the gospel singer Washington Phillips, who used two instruments simultaneously, have revealed the virtuosic capability of the chord zither to modern musicians seeking to revive it. By the 1920s, this popularity had begun to wane, as other string instruments (notably guitars) increased in popularity along with the new fashion for jazz music.

In the 1950s, interest in zithers resurfaced due in great measure to the success of the 1949 British film noir &quot;The Third Man&quot;. The soundtrack music for the film, which featured only a concert zither (no other instruments) – was performed by the Viennese musician Anton Karas. His &quot;The Third Man Theme&quot; was released as a single in 1949–50 and became a best-seller in the UK. Following its release in the U.S. in 1950, it spent eleven weeks at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s U.S. Best Sellers in Stores Chart from 29 April to 8 July. The exposure made Karas an international star. A &quot;Time&quot; magazine film preview stated that &quot;the famous musical score by Anton Karas&quot; would have the audience &quot;in a dither with his zither&quot;.

This new popularity for the zither lasted until well into the 1960s with many successful albums during the period from performers such as Karas, Ruth Welcome, and Shirley Abicair. German-born American Ruth Welcome released a number of very popular theme-based zither albums between 1958 and 1965 (e.g., &quot;Romantic Zither&quot;; &quot;Zither South of the Border&quot;; &quot;Zither Goes to Hollywood&quot;). Australian-born singer Shirley Abicair popularised the chord zither when she used it for accompaniment in her TV shows, live performances and recordings in Britain in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. Zither music also featured in a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode – Mr Bevis in 1960.

Although interest in the zither had once more begun to wane by the late 1960s, owing to the two American vogues there are still many used instruments to be found, in various states of disrepair. It has become something of a truism that most zithers seen today are either 60 or 110 years old. Currently (2019) only a few independent luthiers and mid-European makers are producing new instruments.

==Concert and Alpine zithers==

A concert zither may have from 29 to 38 strings, with 34 or 35 being most typical. These are arranged as follows: four or five fretted melody strings, placed above a guitar-like fretboard; 12 unfretted &quot;accompaniment&quot; strings; followed by 12 unfretted &quot;bass&quot; strings; followed by a varying number of &quot;contrabass&quot; strings, with five or six being the most common number.

On some older zithers, one may find &quot;half-frets&quot; above the 12th fret, which extend only under the first two or three strings. This results in the lower fretted strings having no pitches (or no &quot;chromatic&quot; pitches) available above the 12th fret, while the higher fretted strings still have higher chromatic pitches available at these half-frets. Nearly all instruments made after 1960, however, have full-length frets all the way up the fretboard.

Anton Karas and Ruth Welcome used instruments of similar design to the one illustrated. After World War II, Karas (according to zither scholar Günter Wittenstein, who was acquainted with him) performed on an instrument of larger dimensions than normal – with a 43 cm standard scale length for the fingerboard strings. He used Viennese tuning (see below), but with an altered chromatic sequence for the fingerboard and open strings. The accompaniment strings G and F were tuned an octave higher, while contrabass strings tuned E, F, D, E, C replaced the regular cycle of fifths bass strings. This brought the contrabasses closer to the fingerboard where the player could reach them more easily.

For &quot;The Third Man&quot;, Karas tuned the zither a semi-tone lower, giving a particularly distinctive tone to the contrabass strings. The resulting lower string tension also enabled Karas to perform an expressive vibrato on the fingerboard melody strings. Film director Carol Reed, (on whose oak kitchen table the music was performed), described the sound as &quot;gritty and dirty&quot;, perfectly reflecting the atmospheric mood of the film.
The Alpine zither has 42 strings, and differs from the concert zither primarily in requiring the addition of an extension to the body of the instrument to support both the longer additional contrabass strings and their tuners.

Alpine zithers are tuned in a similar manner to the concert zither, with the accompaniment and bass strings each providing a full set of 12 chromatic pitches also arranged in a cycle of fifths. Contrabass strings are arranged in a descending chromatic scale. Late 19th and early 20th century versions of the instrument were often called &#x27;harp zithers&#x27; – so-named because the pillar extension seemed a miniature version of the harp&#x27;s pillar. The extra contrabass strings ran parallel to the other strings on these earlier instruments, the diagonal arrangement illustrated developed later to assist the right hand in reaching the strings.

There are two popular tunings for the modern zither: Munich and Viennese. The &quot;zither tuning chart&quot; below gives tuning details, including pitches and octaves. Munich tuning is on top, and Vienna tuning below. Some players have used Vienna tuning only for the fretted strings, and Munich tuning for the unfretted strings. Full Viennese tuning is normally used only on instruments with 38 or fewer strings. However Optima makes Strings to allow for &quot;Extended Viennese Tuning&quot; w/ 42 Strings going all the way down to C#1 (the same note on the 2nd Fret of the 5th string on a 5 string Electric Bass).

==Tuning==
Tuning chart for concert and Alpine zithers:


The C#, F, &amp; A strings of the unfretted string section on the fretted zither are colored red; like the red C strings &amp; blue/black F strings of a harp, they act as &quot;separator strings&quot; to give the musician useful reference points when playing.

==Playing techniques==

The zither is played by plucking the strings while it lies flat on a table (which acts as a resonator to amplify the sound), or it can be held on the lap.

On concert and Alpine zithers, the melody strings are pressed to the fingerboard (&quot;fretted&quot;) with the fingers of the left hand, and plucked with a plectrum on the right thumb. The first and second fingers of the right hand pluck the accompaniment and bass strings, and the third finger of the right hand plucks the contrabass strings (there are variants on this technique), some musicians use Plectrums on the other 4 fingers too so they can strike the Accompaniment Strings more easily &amp; get a sharper attack.

The concept of the chord zither is different from that of the concert and alpine zithers. These instruments may have from 12 to 50 (or more) strings, depending on design. All the strings are played open, in the manner of a harp. The strings on the left are arranged in groups of three or four, which form various chords to be played by the left hand. The strings to the right are single (or pairs of) strings intended for the right hand to pick out the melody. Tuning can vary widely from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from model to model, but is usually indicated on the instrument itself, in the form of a chart painted or glued under the strings.

==Contemporary use==
Since the zither requires advanced technique to play anything more than simple tunes, the vast majority of the concert zithers sold never attained more than amateur or (mostly) ornamental use; the playing of Washington Phillips was a rare exception.

As a result, manufacturers attempted to simplify the instrument with various keyboard devices attached to the melody strings (Marxophone, dolceola, celestaphone, tremoloa, etc.). The invention of the autoharp, which uses bars with felt pads attached underneath placed across and above the strings, is probably the most successful adaptation. However, the absence of a fretboard makes the autoharp a closer relative of the chord zither than the concert zither. Presence of the concert zither in classical music remains sparse.

Concert and Alpine zithers remain in use by a relatively small number of contemporary musicians from various global regions and musical genres, either out of interest in traditional musical styles for the instrument, or from a desire to seek new sounds for their music. New variations on the concert zither have also been employed, including the electric zither—and recent instruments that share zither characteristics, such as the Chapman stick.

While use of the concert zither itself has declined, zither music and technique continue to influence contemporary musicians. For example: Canadian musician Jeff Healey, featured in the film thriller &quot;Road House&quot; in 1989, used a zither technique to play electric guitar. Blind from the age of one, Healey began playing when he was three with the instrument flat on his lap, left hand above the fingerboard in the same manner as a zitherist. Although he used a Fender Stratocaster guitar throughout his career, the instrument was in effect being used as an electric zither.

<doc id="194824" wikidata="Q1085072" url="?curid=194824" title="Finnish orthography">
<text>Finnish orthography is based on the Latin script, and uses an alphabet derived from the Swedish alphabet, officially comprising twenty-nine letters but also including two additional letters found in some loanwords. The Finnish orthography strives to represent all morphemes phonologically and, roughly speaking, the sound value of each letter tends to correspond with its value in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) – although some discrepancies do exist.

==Alphabet==

The following table describes how each letter in the Finnish alphabet () is spelled and pronounced separately. If the name of a consonant begins with a vowel (usually ), it can be pronounced and spelled either as a monosyllabic or bisyllabic word. In practice, the names of the letters are rarely spelled, as people usually just type the (uppercase or lowercase) glyph when they want to refer to a particular letter.

The pronunciation instructions enclosed in slashes are broad transcriptions based on the IPA system. In notes, more narrow transcriptions are enclosed in square brackets.
In addition, is sometimes listed separately and after , although officially it is merely a variant of the latter and can be alphabetized as . Similarly, and are variants of and , but they are often overlooked, as they are only used in some relatively new loanwords and foreign names, and may be replaced with and , respectively, if it is technically impossible to reproduce and . The Finnish keyboard layout on Microsoft Windows does not include or ; thus, in practice, only highly formal sources such as official texts, encyclopedias or Helsingin Sanomat use them.

===The extra letters and ===
The main peculiarities in the Finnish alphabet are the two extra vowels ⟨ä⟩ and ⟨ö⟩ (and Swedish ⟨å⟩, which is not actually needed in Finnish). In Finnish, these extra letters are collectively called when they need to be distinguished from the ISO basic Latin alphabet; the word is a somewhat playful modification of , which is Finnish for &quot;alphabet&quot;. Another informal term is or , short for &quot;Scandinavian characters&quot; (however, the Danish and Norwegian ⟨æ⟩ and ⟨ø⟩ are usually not taken into account).

In Finnish, ⟨ä⟩, ⟨ö⟩ and ⟨y⟩ are the &quot;front vowel&quot; counterparts to the &quot;back vowels&quot; ⟨a⟩, ⟨o⟩ and ⟨u⟩; grammatical endings and suffixes using these letters, use either the front or back form depending on the vowel harmony of the word. The glyphs for ⟨ä⟩ and ⟨ö⟩ are derived from the similar-looking German umlauted letters, but as with ⟨y⟩ versus ⟨u⟩, they are considered letters in their own right and thus alphabetized separately (after ⟨z⟩).

The Germanic umlaut or convention of considering digraph ⟨ae⟩ equivalent to ⟨ä⟩, and ⟨oe⟩ equivalent to ⟨ö⟩ is inapplicable in Finnish. Moreover, in Finnish, both ⟨ae⟩ and ⟨oe⟩ are vowel sequences, not single letters, and they have independent meanings (e.g. &quot;I seek&quot; vs. &quot;he, she&quot;).

In handwritten text, the actual form of the extra marking may vary from a pair of dots to a pair of short vertical bars, to a single horizontal bar, or to a wavy line resembling a tilde. In practice, almost any diacritic situated above the base glyph (such as, á ā ã) would probably be interpreted as a carelessly written pair of dots (ä). However, in computerized character sets, these alternatives are incorrect. The front-vowel counterpart of ⟨u⟩ using ⟨y⟩ rather than ⟨ü⟩ is carried over from Swedish, and also avoids confusion in cursive script with ⟨ii⟩, which is common in Finnish.

===Non-native letters in the Finnish alphabet===
In the Finnish writing system, some basic Latin letters are considered redundant, and other letters generally represent sounds that are not inherent in the Finnish language. Thus, they are not used in established Finnish words, but they may occur in newer loanwords as well as in foreign proper names, and they are included in the Finnish alphabet in order to maintain interlingual compatibility. The pronunciation of these letters varies quite a lot.

* The redundant letters are often replaced with more common alternatives in Finnish, except in proper names. They include (which may be replaced with either or ), (which is usually replaced with , and particularly with ), and (which is replaced with ). In addition, the Swedish is redundant from the Finnish point of view, as its pronunciation is more or less equivalent to the Finnish way of pronouncing . It is officially included in the Finnish alphabet so that keyboards etc. would be compatible with Swedish, which is one of the two official languages in Finland, as well as for the reproduction of Swedish proper names, which are quite common in Finland, even as surnames of monolingual speakers of Finnish.
* The letters representing foreign sounds can be found in relatively new loanwords, but in more established loanwords they have been replaced with alternatives that better reflect the typical Finnish pronunciation, e.g. &#x27;coffee&#x27;, &#x27;beard&#x27;. The letters include , , and (which is also used to mark the inherent velar nasal , however). From a historical point of view, even could be said to belong to this group, but the sound has long been an established part of standard language.
* The letters and could be classified into both of the aforementioned groups. The sound is not regarded as a phoneme in Finnish, but historically was used to mark (or, rather, ), as in Dutch, German or Polish. Although this is today considered archaic and is used instead, may still occur in some old surnames as a variant of . Occasionally this can also be applied for faux-archaic effect, as in &quot;Ye Olde Harbour&quot;. Likewise, the is not native to Finnish, but (or ) was formerly used to denote (as in German). It is still often represents , but its pronunciation varies greatly: some speakers may pronounce it , or sometimes . 
* The letters and ( and with caron) are officially recommended instead of and for transliteration from another alphabet, although in practice, and are often used. For example, Russian (transcribed &quot;Brezhnev&quot; in English) is transliterated . However, these sounds are foreign to the Finnish language, the letters do not appear on Finnish keyboards and their pronunciation is not consistent. The sound is familiar to most Finnish speakers and quite commonly used in many loanwords, e.g. &#x27;chess&#x27;, , but is restricted to foreign words only.

==Collation order==
In Finnish, words are ordered alphabetically according to the collation rules specified in the official standard SFS 4600. There are a few cases where Finnish collation is different from the rules applied in English:

* , and are regarded as distinct letters and collated after 
* is generally regarded as equivalent to (in a multilingual context it may, however, be collated separately after , as in English).

Diacritics are never added to letters in native Finnish words (as the dots above the Finnish graphemes and are not considered diacritics). Generally, diacritics are retained in foreign-language proper names, e.g. &quot;Vilén&quot;, if possible, but when arranging words alphabetically, diacritics are usually ignored (this also applies to and , despite them being an officially recognized part of Finnish orthography). There are, however, some exceptions:

* German and Turkish and Hungarian are alphabetized as , not as 
* Danish and Norwegian , Estonian and Hungarian are alphabetized as , not as .

The standard does not specify how one should alphabetize the letter when used in other languages than German, but at least as regards the Estonian or Hungarian , it seems consistent to treat it as equivalent to (and even more so, since in Estonian and Hungarian is not considered a mere variant of , as it is in German). It would seem problematic, however, to apply the same principle to e.g. (u-diaeresis) as used in Spanish or (nasal vowel) as used in Portuguese, as these letters represent quite different orthographic traditions.

Other special cases:

* Sami (&quot;eng&quot;) is alphabetized as 
* Sami ( with stroke) and Icelandic (eth) are alphabetized as 
* Icelandic (&quot;thorn&quot;) is alphabetized as 
* Polish ( with stroke) is alphabetized as .

Ligatures are alphabetized as two individual letters:

* is alphabetized as (not as )
* is alphabetized as (not as )
* is alphabetized as .

Letters and characters taken from other alphabets (e.g. Σ &#x27;Greek capital letter sigma&#x27;) or writing systems are collated after Latin letters.

==Orthographic principles==

When writing Finnish, the foundational principle is that each letter stands for one sound and each sound is always represented by the same letter, within the bounds of a single morpheme. The most notable exception to this rule is the velar nasal , which does not have an allotted letter.

===Short and long sounds===
In Finnish, both vowels and consonants may be either short or long. A short sound is written with a single letter, and a long sound is written with a double letter (digraph). It is necessary to recognize the difference between such words as &#x27;fire&#x27;, &#x27;wind&#x27; and &#x27;customs&#x27;. However, long consonants are sometimes written as short consonants in morpheme boundaries (see Finnish phonology#Sandhi for this phenomenon), thus, is written as &quot;open-box bed for wood chips&quot; instead of expected &quot;*hakellava&quot;, and is &quot;come here&quot; instead of &quot;*tule ttänne&quot; or &quot;*tulet tänne&quot;.

In syllabification, a long consonant is always regarded as having a syllable break in the middle (as in ), but a long vowel (or a diphthong) is regarded as a single unit that functions as the nucleus of a syllable. Either a long or short vowel may occur in a stressed as well as unstressed syllable. The phonetic quality of a vowel remains the same regardless of whether the vowel is long or short, or whether it is stressed or unstressed.

===Velar nasal===
The velar nasal (generally referred to as &#x27;the eng sound&#x27;) does not have a letter of its own. Natively, a short only occurs before , and it is simply written with , as in &#x27;shoe&#x27;. Since the alveolar nasal can not occur in such a position, can be seen as an allophone of . However, if the is weakened (because of a phenomenon called consonant gradation that occurs when the word is inflected), the result is a long, or geminated, velar nasal that is written with digraph , as in &#x27;shoes&#x27;. The geminated is not an allophone of geminated , since minimal pairs do exist: &#x27;textile&#x27; vs. &#x27;isthmus&#x27;.

The treatment of the velar nasal in loanwords is highly inconsistent, often mixing the original spelling of the word with an applied Finnish pronunciation pattern. &quot;England&quot; is pronounced (with a short but no ), and even &quot;magnet&quot; is pronounced (with plain being pronounced as when followed by , as in classical Latin) – cf. a more specialized term &#x27;diagnosis&#x27;, and in a word-initial position &quot;gnu&quot;. Following the typical Finnish pronunciation pattern, &quot;congestion&quot; is often pronounced , but may also occur.

===Voiced plosives===
Traditionally, and are not counted as Finnish phonemes, since they only appear in loanwords. However, these borrowings being relatively common, they are nowadays considered part of the educated norm. The failure to use them correctly is sometimes ridiculed, e.g. if a news reporter or a high official consistently and publicly pronounces &#x27;Belgium&#x27; as . Even many educated speakers, however, still make no distinction between voiced and voiceless plosives in regular speech, although minimal pairs exist: &#x27;bus&#x27; vs. &#x27;bag&#x27;, &#x27;gorilla&#x27; vs. &#x27;with/at a basket&#x27;.

The status of is somewhat different from and , since it appears in native Finnish words, too, as a regular &quot;weak&quot; correspondence of the voiceless (as a result of consonant gradation), and even in the infinitives of many verbs, such as , &quot;to eat&quot;. At the time when Mikael Agricola, the &quot;father&quot; of literary Finnish, devised a system for writing the language, this sound still had the value of the voiced dental fricative , as in English &quot;then&quot;. Since neither Swedish nor German of that time had a separate sign for this sound, Agricola chose to mark it with or .

Later on, the sound developed in a variety of ways in different Finnish dialects: it was deleted, or became a hiatus, a flap consonant, or any of , , , . For example, historical and rare dialectal , &quot;our&quot; &quot;(gen.),&quot; &quot;hand&quot; &quot;(gen.)&quot; could be:
* , 
* (rare) , 

In the middle of the 19th century, a significant portion of the Swedish-speaking upper class in Finland decided that Finnish had to be made equal in usage to Swedish. They even started using Finnish as their home language, even while very few of them really mastered it well. Since the historical no more had a common way of pronunciation between different Finnish dialects and since it was usually written as , many started using the Swedish pronunciation , which eventually became the educated norm.

Initially, few native speakers of Finnish acquired the foreign plosive realisation of the native phoneme. Still some decades ago it was not entirely exceptional to hear loanwords like &#x27;deodorant&#x27; pronounced as , while native Finnish words with a were pronounced in the usual dialectal way. Nowadays, the Finnish language spoken by native Swedish speakers is not anymore considered paradigmatic, but as a result of their long-lasting prestige, many people particularly in the capital district acquired the new sound. Due to diffusion of the standard language through mass media and basic education, and due to the dialectal prestige of the capital area, the plosive can now be heard in all parts of the country, at least in loanwords and in formal speech. Nowadays replacing with a is considered rustic, for example instead of &#x27;now we could use a new directive&#x27;.

In Helsinki slang, the slang used by some, more rarely nowadays, in Helsinki, the voiced stops are found in native words even in positions which are not the result of consonant gradation, e.g. &#x27;s/he walked&#x27; (← native verb root ), &#x27;to understand&#x27; (← Russian понимать). In the Southwestern dialects of Rauma-Eurajoki-Laitila area, , and are commonplace, since the voicing of nasals spread to phonemes , and , making them half-voiced, e.g. ← or ← . They are also found in those coastal areas where Swedish influenced the speech.

<text>Åhus () is the second largest locality in Kristianstad Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden, with 9,840 inhabitants in 2015, but the number triples during the summer due to tourists who come seeking the beaches and nature of the Helgeå and Hanöbukten area. Åhus is also famous for hosting one of the largest beach handball tournaments in the world with approximately 20,000 participants. In 2011, in the village of Rinkaby near Åhus, the World Scout Meeting also known as the Jamboree was held.

== History ==
Åhus history dates back to the late Iron Age/Vendel Period, when a significant trading post was established some distance upstream of the modern settlement. In the 11th century, a castle was built outside the city following the continental model. The construction of the castle was long attributed to the Archbishop of Lund, Eskil, but findings of charcoal in an archaeological survey in 2010 suggest that it may be older than that.

Åhus was originally called Aos (1296). The name means &#x27;estuary&#x27;. During the course of the 14th century, the spelling was gradually changed to Åhus (Aahus 1330). Possibly this change may have taken place through Low German influence.

Built during the 12th century, one of the oldest buildings of Åhus is Sankta Maria kyrka (church of St. Mary).

The city was a significant trading post in the Danish kingdom. Åhus experienced its heyday as a city during the 13th to 15th centuries, when the city obeyed and benefited from Lund&#x27;s diocese. Among other things, a wall was built around half the city and a dike with a moat around half. The ruins of the wall are the second best preserved remains of a medieval ring wall in present-day Sweden. The oldest known city rights are from 1326, but according to the town&#x27;s own tradition, it is believed that it was founded in 1149, when Archbishop Eskil received it as a grant. An old town, Åhus gained its town privileges in 1149, but lost them in 1617 when Kristianstad was built, following the burning of Vä by Swedish king Gustav II Adolf during the Kalmar War, 1611–1613.

Åhus medieval town hall, which is mentioned in writing for the first time in 1431, is partly preserved in the building by the square that now houses the Åhus museum. Åhus lost much of its significance with the Reformation in the 16th century, a century when Swedish looting also hit hard and, among other things, turned the castle into the ruin in the port area where it still is today. The period of decline was completed with Åhus losing its city rights in 1617, when the fortress town of Kristianstad was founded by Christian IV. In 1658, Åhus came to Sweden through the Treaty of Roskilde.

Åhus has long been known as a seaside resort. Already at the end of the 19th century, the bathing trains on the Åhus line ran from Kristianstad to Åhus. On hot summer days, 4,000–5,000 people were able to get off in the current extension of Stubbagatan to wander around Täppetstranden.

The town is also centre for the famous Swedish &quot;Eel-parties&quot; (&quot;ålagille&quot;), where people come together during August and September to eat smoked eel and drink considerable amounts of schnapps, preferably ones like Absolut Vodka that is produced in the town. Absolut Vodka is produced in Åhus, and is then exported to every corner of the world.

In 1950 an ice-cream factory was built in Åhus, Åhus Glass. The factory was bought by another company, and ice-cream is now made and sold under the name Ingman Glass. Today, the original owners of Åhus Glass have reopened under a new brand, Otto Glass, producing ice cream with the original Åhus Glass recipes — the company is famous for its chocolate-dipped waffle cones. Another ice cream factory in Skåne is Engelholms Glass.

<text>The Thomas Coram Foundation for Children is a large children&#x27;s charity in London operating under the name Coram. It was founded by eighteenth-century philanthropist Captain Thomas Coram who campaigned to establish a charity that would care for the high numbers of abandoned babies in London, setting up the Foundling Hospital in 1739 at Lamb&#x27;s Conduit Fields in Bloomsbury. By the 1950s social change had led to the closure of the hospital and the charity adopted the broader name Thomas Coram Foundation for Children in 1954. 

The charity acts as an adoption agency in addition to a wide range of educational and advisory services for children. It retains part of its original site in London but moved its heritage collections into the care of The Foundling Museum in 1998.

== History ==
The Foundling Hospital was established by the philanthropic sea captain Thomas Coram, who was appalled to see abandoned babies and children starving and dying in the streets of London. In 1742–1745 a building was erected north of Lamb&#x27;s Conduit Street in Bloomsbury. Boys were housed in the West Wing of the new home. The East Wing was built in 1752 to house girls.

The artist William Hogarth was a governor of the Foundling Hospital and donated some of his work to the foundation as well as designing its coat of arms. The art collection also contains works by Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Joshua Reynolds, including a full-length portrait of Thomas Coram, along with musical scores by Handel including one of three fair copies of &quot;Messiah&quot;.

In 1926, the Governors of the hospital decided to relocate it out of the city, initially to Redhill, Surrey and then to Berkhamsted in 1935. It then closed as a children&#x27;s home in the 1950s, the buildings becoming Ashlyns School, a local authority school not related to the charity.

The Foundling Hospital was renamed the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children in 1954.

== Activities and services ==
Coram&#x27;s headquarters are at Brunswick Square in London. It operates as a registered voluntary adoption agency and fostering service and in July 2024, Ofsted rated it as &quot;outstanding&quot;.

=== Adoption and care ===
Coram Adoption is an independent adoption service working in London and the surrounding areas.
They also work in partnership with local authorities. Their partnership with the London Borough of Harrow was the first use of the model.
Coram were also one of the pioneers of &#x27;concurrent planning&#x27; (also known as &#x27;foster to adopt&#x27;), and received government funding to become a &#x27;National Centre of Excellence in Early Years Permanence&#x27; in 2012.

In 2015 the British Association for Adoption and Fostering went into administration. Coram took over many of the services in England, offering a total of £40,000 and taking on 50 of the 135 employees. The membership, training and research organisation became CoramBAAF. The Independent Review Mechanism (England) was taken over by Coram Children&#x27;s Legal Centre. The National Adoption Register for England is now run by First4Adoption (jointly run by Coram and Adoption UK).

Coram-i, a company part of the Coram group, helps local authorities improve children’s services by offering consultancy in areas like adoption, fostering, and special guardianship. In 2021, Coram-i launched The Coram Innovation Incubator (CII) in collaboration with ten local authorities – along with EY, Microsoft and PA Consulting – a specialist vehicle for children’s services providers to generate, test and scale innovative solutions to shared challenges facing the children’s social care sector. 

Coram IAC (Intercountry Adoption Centre) is the UK&#x27;s only dedicated international adoption charity and joined Coram in 2023. Since 1997, the organisation has been supporting prospective adopters through preparation, assessment, and the process of being matched with a child from abroad. 

=== Education ===
Coram Life Education runs programmes in schools to educate children about health, wellbeing, and drugs. It was formed in 2009 as an amalgamation between Coram and Life Education.

Coram Beanstalk equips adults and young people to ‘do reading’ better with children through volunteer reading helpers, school and peer mentoring programmes and community groups. 

Coram Shakespeare Schools Foundation (CSSF) works with schools across the UK to give young people the opportunity to build their confidence, skills and knowledge by learning about and performing Shakespeare. 

=== Legal advice and advocacy ===
In 2011, the Children&#x27;s Legal Centre and Coram were amalgamated into Coram Children&#x27;s Legal Centre (CCLC). CCLC’s support covers education, discrimination, immigration, asylum, community care and family law. Coram International is part of CCLC, working with governments, UN bodies, IGOs and NGOs worldwide to protect and promote children and young people’s human rights.

In 2013, the charity Voice merged with Coram to form Coram Voice. Coram Voice is a children’s rights organisation, championing the rights of children in care, care leavers and others who depend upon the help of the state. 

=== Research and evaluation === 
The Coram Institute is a think tank dedicated to the future of children, working with partners and young people to learn from the past, examine current needs and create better chances for the next generation. The Institute informs and influences policy and practice, and collaborates with relevant partners to deliver solutions to the challenges children and young people face today. 

A key area of the Institute, the Coram Impact and Evaluation team conducts research involving children, young people, parents, and professionals to identify and promote best practices that improve outcomes for children.

=== Early years, family and childcare ===
Coram Family and Childcare (CFC) publishes the annual childcare survey, the reference for understanding cost and availability of childcare across Great Britain. It also delivers parent-led programmes nationwide. 

In 2023, Hempsall’s joined Coram as Coram Hempsall’s. Operating since 1999, the organisation supports practitioners, providers, local authorities, and governments in delivering sustainable early years and childcare services. 

== Foundling Museum ==

The historic collections of the Foundling Hospital were moved in the 1920s to Brunswick Square, London, where a museum was established. In 1998 the building and collections were formally constituted as a separate charity, the Foundling Museum.

<text>The Foundling Museum in Brunswick Square, London, tells the story of the Foundling Hospital, Britain&#x27;s first home for children at risk of abandonment. The museum houses the nationally important Foundling Hospital Collection as well as the Gerald Coke Handel Collection, an internationally important collection of material relating to Handel and his contemporaries. After a major building refurbishment, the museum was reopened to the public in June 2004.

The museum explores the history of the Foundling Hospital, which continues today as the children&#x27;s charity Coram. Artists such as William Hogarth and the composer George Frideric Handel are central to the Hospital story and today the museum celebrates the ways in which creative people have helped improve children&#x27;s lives for over 275 years. It is a member of The London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine group.

==History==
The Foundling Hospital was established by the philanthropist Thomas Coram in 1739. After 17 years of tireless campaigning, Coram was finally granted a Royal charter by King George II, enabling him to set up the UK&#x27;s first children&#x27;s charity in Bloomsbury, London. By the early 1920s the hospital was no longer removed from the pollution of the city; it had been subsumed into central London. The trustees of the Hospital decided to relocate operations to a modern purpose-built facility in Berkhamsted. In 1926, the land occupied by the former Hospital in Bloomsbury was sold off and the building torn down. Between 1935 and 1937 the Thomas Coram Foundation (now known as Coram) built a new headquarters at 40 Brunswick Square. The new building incorporated architectural features and Rococo interiors from the original Foundling Hospital building.
The Foundling Museum was established as a separate charitable organisation in 1998. To safeguard and display the collection a deal was agreed in 2002 under which Coram lent the pictures to the museum, allowing it to raise money to buy them over a 25-year period. 
The headquarters was refurbished between 2003 and 2004 by the architectural firm Jestico + Whiles. In 2013 attorney general Dominic Grieve wrote to Coram stating that he was concerned that Coram&#x27;s &quot;treatment of the museum ... does not appear to fit with the spirit and intent of the arrangements put before the attorney general [in 2001]&quot;.

==Collections==
The museum is responsible for the care and maintenance of two collections – the Foundling Hospital Collection and the Foundling Museum Collection, which includes the Gerald Coke Handel Collection. These Collections span the eighteenth to the twentieth century, enabling visitors to make connections between the past and the present. The Foundling Hospital Collection includes works of art by some of Britain&#x27;s most prominent eighteenth-century artists: William Hogarth, Thomas Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds, Louis-Francois Roubiliac and many others. These paintings and sculptures, donated by the artists themselves, were given in order to support the Foundling Hospital and effectively made the institution the UK&#x27;s first public art gallery.

The museum&#x27;s Collections also encompass everyday objects used in the Foundling Hospital and archival materials; books, documents and records, musical scores and librettos, photographs and oral history recordings, as well as clocks, furniture and interiors, many of which were created especially for the hospital and donated by their makers. Some of the most moving objects are the Foundling Hospital tokens – including coins, buttons, jewellery and poems – left by mothers with their babies on admission, enabling the Foundling Hospital to match a mother with her child should she ever return to claim it. The overwhelming majority of the children never saw their mothers again and the tokens are in the care of the museum.

The Committee Room, a reconstruction of one of the original Hospital interiors, is one of the rooms where mothers intending to leave their babies would be interviewed for suitability. It now displays paintings, sculpture and furniture, including Hogarth&#x27;s satirical and political &quot;The March of the Guards to Finchley&quot; and a series of paintings by the nineteenth-century artist Emma Brownlow, depicting scenes from the lives of the children in the Foundling Hospital.

The Picture Gallery is a reconstruction of the original Picture Gallery in the West Wing of the hospital. On the walls are paintings of governors and Hospital officials through the ages. These portraits include William Hogarth&#x27;s magnificent painting of Thomas Coram, Allan Ramsay’s portrait of Dr Richard Mead, Reynolds&#x27; portrait of the Earl of Dartmouth, and Thomas Hudson’s portrait of the hospital&#x27;s architect, Theodore Jacobsen.

The Court Room is where the Foundling Hospital&#x27;s Governors conducted their committee business and entertained important guests. This room is one of the best surviving Rococo interiors in London, with a magnificent plasterwork ceiling given as a gift to the hospital by plasterer William Wilton. Paintings include Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Moses before Pharaoh’s Daughter&quot; and Gainsborough&#x27;s picture of London&#x27;s Charterhouse.

The uppermost floor of the Foundling Museum houses the Gerald Coke Handel Collection. Visitors can learn about Handel&#x27;s connection to the Foundling Hospital and see his Will he left behind, alongside manuscripts and printed scores, books, works of art, programmes and ephemera. A fair copy of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, left to the hospital at his death, is also displayed. Four armchairs with built-in speakers play nine hours of Handel&#x27;s music.

<doc id="194839" wikidata="Q3274389" url="?curid=194839" title="Hebern rotor machine">
<text>The Hebern Rotor Machine was an electro-mechanical encryption machine built by combining the mechanical parts of a standard typewriter with the electrical parts of an electric typewriter, connecting the two through a scrambler. It is the first example (though just barely) of a class of machines known as rotor machines that would become the primary form of encryption during World War II and for some time after, and which included such famous examples as the German Enigma.

==History==

Edward Hugh Hebern was a building contractor who was jailed in 1908 for stealing a horse. It is claimed that, with time on his hands, he started thinking about the problem of encryption, and eventually devised a means of mechanizing the process with a typewriter. He filed his first patent application for a cryptographic machine (not a rotor machine) in 1912. At the time he had no funds to be able to spend time working on such a device, but he continued to produce designs. Hebern made his first drawings of a rotor-based machine in 1917, and in 1918 he built a model of it. In 1921 he applied for a patent for it, which was issued in 1924. He continued to make improvements, adding more rotors. Agnes Driscoll, the chief civilian employee of the US Navy&#x27;s cryptography operation (later to become OP-20-G) between WWI and WWII, spent some time working with Hebern before returning to Washington and OP-20-G in the mid-&#x27;20s.

Hebern was so convinced of the future success of the system that he formed the Hebern Electric Code company with money from several investors. Over the next few years he repeatedly tried to sell the machines both to the US Navy and Army, as well as to commercial interests such as banks. None was terribly interested, as at the time cryptography was not widely considered important outside governments. It was probably because of William F. Friedman&#x27;s confidential analysis of the Hebern machine&#x27;s weaknesses (substantial, though repairable) that its sales to the US government were so limited; Hebern was never told of them. Perhaps the best indication of a general distaste for such matters was the statement by Henry Stimson in his memoirs that &quot;Gentlemen do not read each other&#x27;s mail.&quot; It was Stimson, as Secretary of State under Hoover, who withdrew State Department support for Herbert Yardley&#x27;s American Black Chamber, leading to its closing.

Eventually his investors ran out of patience, and sued Hebern for stock manipulation. He spent another brief period in jail, but never gave up on the idea of his machine. In 1931 the Navy finally purchased several systems, but this was to be his only real sale.

There were three other patents for rotor machines issued in 1919, and several other rotor machines were designed independently at about the same time. The most successful and widely used was the Enigma machine.

==Description==

The key to the Hebern design was a disk with electrical contacts on either side, known today as a &quot;rotor&quot;. Linking the contacts on either side of the rotor were wires, with each letter on one side being wired to another on the far side in a random fashion. The wiring encoded a single substitution alphabet.

When the user pressed a key on the typewriter keyboard, a small amount of current from a battery flowed through the key into one of the contacts on the input side of the disk, through the wiring, and back out a different contact. The power then operated the mechanicals of an electric typewriter to type the encrypted letter, or alternately simply lit a bulb or paper tape punch from a teletype machine.

Normally such a system would be no better than the single-alphabet systems of the 16th century. However the rotor in the Hebern machine was geared to the keyboard on the typewriter, so that after every keypress, the rotor turned and the substitution alphabet thus changed slightly. This turns the basic substitution into a polyalphabetic one similar to the well known Vigenère cipher, with the exception that it required no manual lookup of the keys or cyphertext. Operators simply turned the rotor to a pre-chosen starting position and started typing. To decrypt the message, they turned the rotor around in its socket so it was &quot;backwards&quot;, thus reversing all the substitutions. They then typed in the ciphertext and out came the plaintext.

Better yet, several rotors can be placed such that the output of the first is connected to the input of the next. In this case the first rotor operates as before, turning once with each keypress. Additional rotors are then spun with a cam on the one beside it, each one being turned one position after the one beside it rotates a full turn. In this way the number of such alphabets increases dramatically. For a rotor with 26 letters in its alphabet, five such rotors &quot;stacked&quot; in this fashion allows for 265 = 11,881,376 different possible substitutions.

William F. Friedman attacked the Hebern machine soon after it came on the market in the 1920s. He quickly &quot;solved&quot; any machine that was built similar to the Hebern, in which the rotors were stacked with the rotor at one end or the other turning with each keypress, the so-called &quot;fast rotor&quot;. In these cases the resulting ciphertext consisted of a series of single-substitution cyphers, each one 26 letters long. He showed that fairly standard techniques could be used against such systems, given enough effort.

Of course, this fact was itself a great secret. This may explain why the Army and Navy were unwilling to use Hebern&#x27;s design, much to his surprise.

<doc id="194841" wikidata="Q1074523" url="?curid=194841" title="Planned community">
<text>A planned community, planned city, planned town, or planned settlement is any community that was carefully planned from its inception and is typically constructed on previously undeveloped land. This contrasts with settlements that evolve organically.

The term &quot;new town&quot; refers to planned communities of the new towns movement in particular, mainly in the United Kingdom. It was also common in the European colonization of the Americas to build according to a plan either on fresh ground or on the ruins of earlier Native American villages.

A model city is a type of planned city designed to a high standard and intended as a model for others to imitate. The term was first used in 1854.

==Planned capitals==
A planned capital is a city specially planned, designed and built to be a capital. Several of the world&#x27;s national capitals are planned capitals, including Canberra in Australia, Brasília in Brazil, Belmopan in Belize, New Delhi in India, Abuja in Nigeria, Islamabad in Pakistan, Naypyidaw in Myanmar (Burma), Washington, D.C. in the United States, the modern parts of Astana in Kazakhstan, and Ankara in Turkey. In Indonesia, Nusantara is planned to be inaugurated on 17 August 2024, and in Egypt a new capital city (to the east of Cairo) is under construction. Putrajaya, the federal administrative and judicial centre of Malaysia, is also a planned city.

Abu Dhabi (UAE) and some of the recently built cities in the Persian Gulf region are also planned cities.

Sejong was constructed to be a planned-administrative capital of South Korea.

==Africa==

=== Botswana ===
The city of Gaborone was planned and constructed in the 1960s.

Tatu City is also another planned city located in Kiambu county.

===Nigeria===
The capital, Abuja, is a planned city and was built mainly in the 1980s. Several other cities are under development to accommodate the rapidly growing population, some of which include: Eko Atlantic City, a planned city of Lagos State being constructed on land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean. Upon completion, the new city which is still under development, is anticipating 250,000 residents and a daily flow of 150,000 commuters. Centenary City, in the Federal Capital Territory, is another planned smart city under development. The city is designed to become a major tourist attraction to the country. A list of Nigerian cities and neighbourhoods that went through a form of planning are as follows:

===South Africa===
A number of cities were set up during the apartheid-era for a variety of ethnic groups. Planned settlements set up for white inhabitants included Welkom, Sasolburg and Secunda. Additionally the majority of settlements in South Africa were planned in their early stages and the original town centres still lie in a grid street fashion. Some settlements were also set up for non-whites such as the former homeland capital of Bisho.

=== Azerbaijan ===

* Sumqayit was planned as an industrial city to support the Soviet Union’s petrochemical industry. It became one of Azerbaijan&#x27;s major industrial centers, housing factories and workers&#x27; residential areas.
* Mingachevir was established in the 1940s as a planned city to serve as the center for Azerbaijan’s hydroelectric power production, hosting the Mingachevir Hydroelectric Power Station, one of the largest in the country.
* Ganja underwent urban planning during the Soviet period, with the development of modern infrastructure including residential and commercial districts, along with the expansion of industrial facilities to support the growing population.
* Shirvan was developed as an industrial city, with a focus on chemical and agricultural industries. The city&#x27;s growth was part of the Soviet-era initiative to establish more industrial hubs in Azerbaijan.
* Gabala, once a small town, is undergoing urbanization with modern infrastructure projects aimed at transforming it into a major tourist and cultural center while still preserving its natural surroundings.
* Khirdalan, located near Baku, was developed as a satellite city to ease the population pressure in the capital. The city has seen significant growth with new residential areas and local amenities.

===Hong Kong===
The terrains of Hong Kong are mostly mountainous and many places in the New Territories have limited access to roads. Hong Kong started developing new towns in the 1950s, to accommodate rapidly growing populations. In the early days the term &quot;satellite towns&quot; was used. The very first new towns included Tsuen Wan and Kwun Tong. Wah Fu Estate was built in a remote corner on Hong Kong Island, with similar concepts in a smaller scale.

In the late 1960s and the 1970s, another stage of new town developments was launched. Nine new towns have been developed to date. Land use is carefully planned and development provides plenty of room for public housing projects. Rail transport is usually available at a later stage. The first towns are Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun and Tseung Kwan O. Tuen Mun was intended to be self-reliant, but was not successful at the beginning and maintained as a dormitory town up until the recent decades like the other new towns. More recent developments are Tin Shui Wai and North Lantau. The government also plans to build such towns in Hung Shui Kiu, Ping Che-Ta Kwu Ling, Fanling North and Kwu Tung North. At present, there are a total of nine new towns:
* Tsuen Wan New Town
* Sha Tin New Town
* Tuen Mun New Town
* Tai Po New Town
* Fanling-Sheung Shui New Town
* Yuen Long New Town
* Tseung Kwan O New Town
* Tin Shui Wai New Town
* North Lantau New Town

=== Indonesia ===
* Jakarta
** Batavia (predecessor of modern Jakarta) was a planned city, modeled after Dutch 17th century coastal city architecture. First, in the 17th century as a planned fortified city, crisscrossed with Dutch-style canals dug in regular grid. The city served as the administrative center of Dutch East India Company.
** In the early 19th century, the Dutch colonial authority moved their administrative center from the dilapidated and unhealthy port town of Old Batavia (now Kota area) several kilometres south to Weltevreden area (now Central Jakarta). Old Batavia and Weltevreden were connected by the Molenvliet Canal and a road (now Gajah Mada Road) that ran alongside the waterway. It was a well-planned community around the Koningsplein, the Waterlooplein and Rijswijk (Jalan Veteran). The area, then known as Weltevreden, which include the Koningsplein, Rijswijk, Noordwijk, Tanah Abang, Kebon Sirih, and Prapatan became a popular residential, entertainment and commercial district for the European colonial elite.
** Menteng, today a sub-district in Central Jakarta, was first built as a well-planned community. An urban design developed in the 1910s set the area to become a residential area for Dutch people and high officials. At the time of its development, the area was the first planned garden suburb in colonial Batavia. Supported by easy access to service centers and nearby to the central business district, this area has become one of the most expensive areas for residential real estate in modern Jakarta.
* In the early 20th century, Bandung was planned by the Dutch East Indies government as a new capital city to replace Batavia. The idea was to separate the busy trading port or the commercial center (Batavia) from the new administrative and political center (Bandung). By the 1920s the plan to transfer the capital to Bandung was underway. As the city began to laid the master plan of a well-planned new city, grid of streets and avenues were laid, and numbers of government buildings were constructed, such as Gedung Sate that was planned as the colonial administrative center of Dutch East Indies. The plan, however, failed due to the Great Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War.
* Since Palangkaraya was established as the capital of Central Kalimantan province in 1957, the first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, outlined a plan to develop Palangkaraya as the future capital of Indonesia. Palangkaraya is far larger in area than Jakarta and safe from the danger of earthquakes and volcanoes, common on the island of Java.
* In the late 1950s to the first half of the 1960s, Sukarno, Indonesia&#x27;s first president, laid a master plan to build Jakarta as the planned national capital of the Republic of Indonesia. He filled Jakarta with numbers of monuments and statues. Numbers of monumental projects were conceived, planned and initiated during his administration, including Monumen Nasional, Istiqlal mosque, DPR/MPR Building, and Gelora Bung Karno stadium. Sukarno also filled Jakarta with nationalistic monuments and statues, including Selamat Datang Monument, Pemuda Monument at Senayan, Dirgantara Monument at Pancoran, and Irian Jaya Liberation Monument at Lapangan Banteng. Although many of this projects were completed later in his successor era (Suharto administration), Sukarno is credited for shaping Jakarta&#x27;s monuments and landmarks. He desired Jakarta to be the beacon of a powerful new nation. 
* Because of Jakarta&#x27;s environmental degradation and overpopulation problems, there has been an idea to build a new proposed capital city to replace Jakarta. In 2019, President Joko Widodo announced that Indonesia will move its capital from Jakarta to the new planned city in the East Kalimantan province which will be built in between the regencies of Penajam North Paser and Kutai Kartanegara. Its construction will commence in 2020. The new national capital will be called Nusantara and it is set to be inaugurated in 2024 with the groundbreaking ceremony in March 2022. The capital is expected to form a new province separated from East Kalimantan, similar to Jakarta.

===Iran===

In the period of the Persian Safavid Empire, Isfahan, the Persian capital, was built according to a planned scheme, consisting of a long boulevard and planned housing and green areas around it.

In modern-day Iran more than 20 planned cities have been developed or are under construction, mostly around Iran&#x27;s main metropolitan areas such as Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz and Tabriz. Some of these new cities are built for special purposes such as:
* Pardis, which is built as a scientific city.
* Poulad-Shahr, which is an industrial city built for the housing of Isfahan&#x27;s steel industry workers.
* Shirin Shahr which is to provide housing for the sugar industry personnel.
* Tehranpars which was built to house Tehran&#x27;s additional population.
* Shahrak-e Gharb, built as a massive project of modern apartment buildings.
* Parand which is intended to provide residences for the staff of Imam Khomeini International Airport.
* Shushtar New Town which was built to provide housing for the employees of a sugar cane processing plant.

576,000 people were planned to be settled in Iran&#x27;s new towns by 2005.

For a list of Iran&#x27;s modern planned cities see: List of Iran&#x27;s planned cities.

===Israel===

According to politics of country settlement a number of planned cities were created in peripheral regions. De facto all the cities which have Jewish population its new Jewish side have been planned like New Acre and Nazareth Illit. Those cities also known as &quot;Development Towns&quot;. The most successful is Ashdod with more than 200,000 inhabitants, a port and developed infrastructure. Other cities that were developed following Israel&#x27;s lineation plan are Shoham, Karmiel and Arad. Modi&#x27;in-Maccabim-Re&#x27;ut has been another of the country&#x27;s most successful planned cities. Construction began in 1994 and it now has a population of over 80,000. Modi&#x27;in also rates higher in terms of average salary and graduation rates than the national average. It was designed and planned by Israeli architect Moshe Safdie. Many Israeli settlements follow this model, including towns like Modi&#x27;in Illit and Betar Illit.

===Malaysia===
* Kuala Kubu Bharu
* Bandar Baru Bangi
* Shah Alam
* Putrajaya, Malaysia&#x27;s new administrative capital
* Cyberjaya
* Petaling Jaya (New Town) 
* Kulim Hi-Tech Park
* Iskandar Puteri
* Iskandar Malaysia

===Japan===

The city of Kyoto was developed as a planned city in 794 as a new imperial capital (then called Heian-kyō), built on a grid layout and remained the capital for over a millennium. The grid layout remains, reflected in major east–west streets being numbered, such as . In modern times, Sapporo was built from 1868, following an American grid plan, and is today the fifth-largest city in Japan. Both these cities have regular addressing systems (following the grid) unlike the usual subdivision-based Japanese addressing system.
Borrowing from the New Town movement in the United Kingdom, some 30 new towns have been built all over Japan. Most of these constructions were initiated during the period of rapid economic growth in the 1960s, but construction continued into the 1980s. Most of them are located near Tokyo and the big cities in Kansai region. Some towns, (, Tama New Town) do not provide much employment, and many of the residents commute to the nearby cities. These towns fostered the infamous congestion of commuter trains (although as the metropolitan areas have grown, this commute has become relatively short in comparison to commutes from the new urban fringe).

Other New Towns act as industrial/academic agglomerations (&quot;sangyo-shuseki&quot;) (Tsukuba Science City, Kashima Port Town). These areas attempt to create an all-inclusive environment for daily living, in accordance with Uzō Nishiyama&#x27;s &quot;life-spheres&quot; principle.

Japan has also developed the concept of new towns to what Manuel Castells and Sir Peter Hall call technopolis. The technopolis program of the 1980s has precedents in the New Industrial Cities Act of the 1960s. These cities are largely modeled after Tsukuba Academic New Town (Tsukuba Science City) in that they attempt to agglomerate high-tech resources together in a campus-like environment.

In the past, the Japanese government had proposed relocating the capital to a planned city, but this plan was cancelled.

Overall, Japan&#x27;s New Town program consists of many diverse projects, most of which focus on a primary function, but also aspire to create an all-inclusive urban environment. Japan&#x27;s New Town program is heavily informed by the Anglo-American Garden City tradition, American neighborhood design, as well as Soviet strategies of industrial development.

In 2002 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi announced the end of new town construction, although the new towns continue to receive government funding and redevelopment.

=== Kazakhstan ===
Kazakhstan has several planned cities, many of which were founded in recent history as part of the country’s shift from its historically nomadic pastoralism to a more urbanized and industrialized society. This transition began particularly during the Soviet era, as the country developed its infrastructure and urban areas to support industrial growth and modernization. 

Some of the most prominent planned cities in Kazakhstan reflect this shift, with their establishment linked to the growth of key industries such as energy, mining, and manufacturing:

* Astana was originally founded as Akmolinsk and was restructured to become the planned capital city of Kazakhstan in 1997. Its modern planning by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa reflects the shift towards urbanization and industrialization, focusing on government institutions, modern infrastructure, and green spaces.
* Turkistan has recently started undergoing significant urbanization and development. Historically a center for cultural and religious importance, the city now enjoys special city status, with efforts to preserve its historical appearance through the establishment of a reserve of archaeological monuments, while new infrastructure is being built in a traditional design style.
* Ekibastuz was planned during the Soviet era to support coal mining and energy production, serving as an industrial city built for the region&#x27;s resource needs.
* Zhanaozen was developed as a key hub for Kazakhstan’s oil and gas industry, designed to support workers in this vital sector.
* Temirtau was a planned industrial city created in the 20th century to support Kazakhstan&#x27;s steel production industry.
* Aktau was built as a planned center to support the growing oil industry, positioned along the Caspian Sea as a hub for Kazakhstan’s energy sector.
* Karaganda was initially developed as a mining town, later becoming a planned city with infrastructure to support coal mining and steel production.
* Shymkent though it has ancient roots, the modern development of Shymkent reflects Kazakhstan&#x27;s post-Soviet urbanization, with the city growing around trade, industry, and administrative functions.
* Pavlodar was developed as an industrial hub focused on chemical and energy industries.
* Atyrau was transformed from a fishing village into a planned city, primarily due to its proximity to Kazakhstan’s key oil and gas reserves.
* Kyzylorda was developed in response to the need for irrigation and agriculture in southern Kazakhstan.
* Saran was a small industrial city developed during the Soviet era to support Kazakhstan’s steel industry, particularly as a satellite city of larger industrial centers like Karaganda.
* Aksu was created as a planned industrial town to support the development of aluminum production.
* Kokshetau was a small town that evolved into a regional center, planned with a focus on agriculture and light industry.
* Baikonur was established as the Soviet Union&#x27;s primary space launch facility and remains a key planned city in Kazakhstan, designed to support space exploration and technology.

===Myanmar===
Naypyidaw is the capital of Myanmar. It is administered by the Naypyidaw Union Territory, as per the 2008 Constitution. On 6 November 2005, the administrative capital of Myanmar was officially moved to a greenfield 3.2 km west of Pyinmana, and approximately 300 km north of Yangon (Rangoon), the previous capital. The capital&#x27;s official name was announced on 27 March 2006, coinciding with Myanmar&#x27;s Armed Forces Day. Much of the city was still under construction as late as 2012. As of 2009, the population was 925,000, which makes it Myanmar&#x27;s third largest city, after Yangon and Mandalay.

=== Pakistan ===
* Islamabad, planned capital city whose foundations were laid during the 1950s
*Ravi City, riverfront and urban development megaproject (expected population 25–35 million, under construction )
* Gwadar, port city established as the southern leg for China–Pakistan Economic Corridor
* Faisalabad, established by the British and later Ayub Khan as a planned industrial city
* Jauharabad, a planned town situated in Khushab District, Punjab, Pakistan
* Sargodha, established by the British for air defence
* Sahiwal
* Bahria Town, privately built towns in Islamabad–Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
Many ancient cities in China, especially those on the North China Plain, were carefully designed according to the fengshui theory, featuring square or rectangular city walls, rectilinear road grid, and symmetrical layout. Famous examples are Chang&#x27;an in Tang dynasty and Beijing.

An exception to that is an ancient town in Tekes County, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang, with a shape of a ba gua.

In modern China, many special economic zones are developed from the sketch, for example, Pudong, a new district of Shanghai.

===Philippines===
Quezon City was the planned city of President Manuel L. Quezon, who had earlier proposed a new city to be built on land northeast of the City of Manila. Carefully planned districts include Santa Mesa Heights (part of the original Burnham Plan for Manila), the Diliman Estate (includes the University of the Philippines), New Manila, the Cubao Commercial District, South Triangle, Housing Projects 1 (Roxas District), 2 and 3 (Quirino District), 4, 5 (Kamias-Kamuning District), 6, 7, and 8.

President Elpidio Quirino proclaimed Quezon City as the national capital on 17 July 1948, with President Ferdinand Marcos restoring Manila as the capital on 24 June 1976. He then created a metropolitan area called Metro Manila, which remains congested today due to failed execution of the Quezon City plan as well as the Burnham Plan.

Other planned cities (in order of foundation):
* Baguio
* Trece Martires, Cavite
* Island Garden City of Samal
* Palayan, Nueva Ecija
* New Clark City

===Saudi Arabia===
King Abdullah Economic City, a future planned city along the Red Sea located in Saudi Arabia.

In 1975, Jubail Industrial City, also known as Jubail, was designated as a new industrial city by the Saudi government. It provides 50% of the country&#x27;s drinking water through desalination of the water from the Persian Gulf.

===Singapore===

The new town planning concept was introduced into Singapore with the building of the first New Town, Queenstown, from July 1952 to 1973 by the country&#x27;s public housing authority, the Housing and Development Board. Today, the vast majority of the approximately 11,000 public housing buildings are organised into 22 new towns across the country.

Each new town is designed to be completely self-sustainable. Helmed by a hierarchy of commercial developments, ranging from a town centre to precinct-level outlets, there is no need to venture out of town to meet the most common needs of residences. Employment can be found in industrial estates located within several towns. Educational, health care, and recreational needs are also taken care of with the provision of schools, hospitals, parks, sports complexes, and so on.

Singapore&#x27;s expertise in successful new town design was internationally recognised when the Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF) of the United Nations awarded the World Habitat Award to Tampines New Town, which was selected as a representative of Singapore&#x27;s new towns, on 5 October 1992.

===South Korea===
Since 2007 Sejong was planned as the new capital, but it is becoming the de facto administrative capital instead, with many national government agencies and research institutes moving there between 2013 and present. It has a planned population of 0.8 million, which is the largest of all the newtown development plans. The head of the domestic-administration, the Prime Minister of South Korea also resides in Sejong, along with more than 65% of the South Korea&#x27;s government facilities.
New Songdo City is a planned international business centre to be developed on 6 square kilometres of reclaimed land along Incheon&#x27;s waterfront, 65 kilometres west of Seoul and connected to Incheon International Airport by a 10-kilometre highway bridge. This 10-year development project is estimated to cost in excess of $40 billion, making it the largest private development project ever undertaken anywhere in the world.

Gwanggyo newtown is located 25 km south away from Seoul in Suwon city and Youngin city, Gyeonggi province. Gwanggyo newtown area 11 square kilometers was designated in 2004 by Gyeonggi Province, Suwon city, Youngin city, and Gyeonggi Development Corporation (GICO). It will accommodate more than 31,000 households. Gwanggyo newtown was not only for the housing supply but also for several regional goals such as provincial office movement, convention center building, and creating economic growth core in Gyeonggi provincial area. Its infrastructure was scheduled to be constructed by 2012.

Since the 1990s, several planned communities were built in the Seoul Metropolitan Area to alleviate housing demands in Seoul. They include:
* Several ongoing developments in Hwaseong, including Bongdam, Dongtan1 &amp; 2, and Hyangnam, Suji in Yongin.
* Gangnam, Seocho &amp; Jamsil, Southern Seoul called Gangnam
* Bundang, Seongnam City
* Ilsan, Goyang City
* Hwajeong, Goyang City
* Jungdong, Bucheon
* Pyeongchon, Anyang
* Sanbon, Gunpo
* Dongtan1, Hwaseong
* Dongtan2, East Hwaseong: The largest in South Korea with more than 100,000 flats and 300,000 inhabitants
* Pangyo, Seongnam City
* Wirye, SE Seoul
* Haewun dae in East Busan.
* Myeongji in West Busan
* Dunsan in Daejeon after relocating air field site development.

===Taiwan===
After losing the Chinese Civil War, the central government of China and its government forces retreated to the former Qing province and later Japanese colony of the island of Taiwan, which was still a Japanese territory under Allied occupation. As a result, Nationalist forces constructed several military dependents&#x27; villages that were intended to be temporary housing for party members and their families to regain Mainland China from the Communists. Many of these neighborhoods became permanent and still exist today.

Beginning in the 1950s, the Taiwan Provincial Government was moved out of Taipei to central Taiwan for security reasons. Several new planned communities were created to house these government employees. The first planned community under the background was Guangfu New Village, located in Wufeng, Taichung. After Guangfu New Village, other communities were created as well:

* Zhongxing New Village, the seat of the provincial government, Nantou County
* Liming New Village, Taichung City

In the 1970s, several new cities were planned to help alleviate the overpopulation in Taiwan&#x27;s largest cities, including Linkou new town and Danhai New Town to alleviate Taipei downtown&#x27;s overpopulation, Dapingding new town to alleviate Kaohsiung downtown. Most of the new city plans during the time did not succeed due to strong opposition from locals and negative responses from various government departments.

Taichung&#x27;s 7th Redevelopment Zone, which is located in Taichung, Taiwan, was a major planned community. Before Taichung&#x27;s 7th Redevelopment Zone Plan, only a few farmhouses were scattered along a limited number of narrow streets. Today, this area the new central business district (CBD) of Taichung, away from the city&#x27;s Central District. It features broad and widely spaced boulevards, large apartments complexes, department stores, and office towers. There are many universities nearby, such as Tunghai University and Feng Chia University.

===Turkey===
Some parts of the biggest city, Istanbul, are being re-developed and re-planned.

The capital, Ankara, was built by a plan and is constantly re-planned.

Atça, Aydın was burned down by Greek forces in the Turkish Independence War. The rebuilding plan was based on Paris&#x27; plan.

Some other cities including Erzincan, Karabük, Kars, Kayseri, Konya were also planned.

===United Arab Emirates===

* Capital city of Abu Dhabi, is a planned city to some extent
* New Khalifa City The city is part of Abu Dhabi&#x27;s Vision 2030 new city plan.
* Certain new parts of Dubai, are planned
* Masdar City, conceived of as a mixed purpose residential and commercial area

===South Asia===
====Ancient history====
An urban culture is evident in the mature phase of Indus Valley civilization which thrived in present-day Pakistan and north western India from around 3300 BC. The quality of municipal city planning suggests knowledge of urban planning and efficient municipal governments which placed a high priority on hygiene. The streets of major cities in present-day Pakistan such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, the world&#x27;s earliest planned cities, were laid out in a perfect grid pattern comparable to that of present-day New York City. The houses were protected from noise, odours, and thieves.

As seen in the ancient sites of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro in Pakistan and western border of India, this urban plan included the world&#x27;s first urban sanitation systems. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from wells. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, waste water was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets. Houses opened only to inner courtyards and smaller lanes.

The ancient Indus systems of sewage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the Indus Valley were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in some areas of modern South Asia today. The advanced architecture of the Harappans is shown by their dockyards, granaries, warehouses, brick platforms, and protective walls.

====Medieval history====
A number of medieval Indian cities were planned including:
* Ahmedabad in Gujarat. Established by Sultan Ahmad Shah in 1411.
* Jaipur in Rajasthan. Established in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II.It is the capital of Rajasthan state of India.
* Udaipur in Rajasthan. It was the historic capital of the former kingdom of Mewar.
*Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu Which was the Capital of Chola dynasty During the Rule King Raja Raja Cholan
* Madurai, in the state of Tamil Nadu. It was the capital of the erstwhile Pandyan kingdom and is noted for its lotus-like symmetry.
* Fatehpur Sikri in Agra. Its planning was done by the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.
* Vijayanagar in Karnataka, the capital of the erstwhile Vijayanagara Empire.
* Hampi in Karnataka, which was the former capital of the Vijayanagara Empire prior to the city of Vijayanagar.

====Modern history====
=====India=====

India has a number of planned cities. Some prominent planned cities are Navi Mumbai, Noida, Dholera, Amaravati, New Delhi and Chandigarh. Noida was one of the most successful experiments as a planned city, undertaken by the State Government. It was divided into sectors, with residential and commercial zones, local water tanks and electricity distributors. Each sector is surrounded by roads, which ultimately connect to New Delhi, the capital of India.

The period following independence saw India being defined into smaller geographical regions. New states such as Gujarat were formed with planned capital cities.

The major planned cities of India include:
* Amaravati, a new city planned to become the capital of Andhra Pradesh
* Auroville
* Bhilai, planned township in Chhattisgarh
* Bhubaneshwar, the capital of Odisha
* Bidhannagar, Kolkata (Salt Lake City), planned township near Kolkata

=== Turkmenistan ===
Arkadag, named in honor of Turkmenistan’s former President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, is a new planned smart city in Turkmenistan. Situated to the southeast of Ashgabat, the city is designed to be a modern and innovative urban hub, reflecting Turkmenistan&#x27;s aspirations for technological advancement and sustainable development. Arkadag is being developed with a focus on smart technologies, including energy efficiency, modern infrastructure, and eco-friendly solutions, while preserving Turkmen cultural heritage. This city is part of a broader vision to diversify the country’s urban landscape and provide an advanced living environment for its residents.

Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, is a city that has been thoughtfully planned, with its foundations laid during the Soviet era. After Turkmenistan gained independence in 1991, the city saw considerable expansion and development. Ashgabat&#x27;s layout is distinguished by monumental structures, grand government buildings, and wide avenues, many of which are made of marble. The urban development aims to showcase the national pride and Turkmen heritage, combining modern infrastructure with elements of traditional culture.

Türkmenbaşy, formerly known as Krasnovodsk, was transformed into a resort town during the Soviet era. Located on the Caspian Sea coast, the city was developed as an important port and industrial center. In 1993, after Turkmenistan gained independence, the city was renamed Türkmenbaşy in honour of the country’s first president, Saparmurat Niyazov, who oversaw its further development. The city is known for its modern infrastructure, including wide streets, government buildings, and beach hotels, and serves as a major hub for the country’s oil and gas industries.

==Europe==
===History===
New settlements were planned in Europe at least since Greek antiquity (see article History of urban planning). The Greeks built new colonial cities around the Mediterranean. The ancient Romans also founded many new colonial towns through their empire. There are, however, also traces of planned settlements of non-Roman origin in pre-historic northern Europe. Most planned settlements of medieval Europe were created in the period of about the 12th to 14th centuries. All kinds of landlords, from the highest to the lowest rank, tried to found new villages and towns on their estates, to gain economic, political or military power. The settlers generally were attracted by fiscal, economic and juridical advantages granted by the founding lord, or were forced to move from elsewhere from his estates. Most of the new towns were to remain rather small (as for instance the bastides of southwestern France), but some of them became important cities, such as Cardiff, Leeds, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Montauban, Bilbao, Malmö, Lübeck, Munich, Berlin, Bern, Klagenfurt, Alessandria, Warsaw and Sarajevo.

====Roman Empire====
The Romans built a large number of towns throughout their empire, often as colonies for the settlement of citizens or veterans. These were generally characterised by a grid of streets and a planned water-supply; and many modern European towns of originally Roman foundation still retain part of the original street-grid.

===Belarus===
Belarus has several planned towns, all built during the 1950s – 1970s from Komsomol rapid construction projects. These planned towns include:
*Salihorsk, built anew to host the population of Belaruskali workers
*Svietlahorsk, built on site of &quot;Shatsilki&quot; village to host population of Svetlahorsk power plant, Svetlahorsk chemical textile plant and Svietlahorsk cellulose-cardboard combinate.
*Navapolatsk, built to host the population of Naftan Oil Refinery workers
*Novalukoml, built to host workers of Lukoml power plant

===Belgium===
As many Roman army camps, the settlement of &quot;Atuatuca Tungrorum&quot;, on the site of the modern town of Tongeren, grew into an important regional centre, laid out along a grid plan and supplied with water by an aqueduct. While Tongeren&#x27;s administrative and military functions were moved to Maastricht in the wake of Germanic invasions in the 350s, given the latter&#x27;s better strategic position, remains of the Roman town are visible up to this day.

Named after king Charles II of Spain, the town of Charleroi (or &quot;Caroloregium&quot;, in Latin) was founded in 1666 as a stronghold near the French border, to fend off potential invasions. A few years before, in 1659, the border between France and the Spanish Netherlands had shifted northward due to the Treaty of the Pyrenees. This shift, and the consequent loss of fortified border towns such as Cambrai and Avesnes had sparked the need to found new forts to defend the border. The original fortifications were destroyed between 1867 and 1871, making place for a quickly expanding industrial centre.

In 1923, the city of Antwerp annexed the sparsely populated, marshy lands known as Vlaams Hoofd, with the intention of using the area for urban development. Over the following decades, the terrain was elevated and a new urban community, now called Linkeroever (literally &#x27;Left Bank&#x27;), was created. Notably, Le Corbusier submitted a plan along the lines of his &quot;Cité radieuse&quot; but neither his plan nor those of his colleagues were accepted. Instead, Linkeroever was developed gradually over the 20th and 21st centuries, inspired by a mix of modernist and later ideas.

When the Catholic University of Leuven was split along linguistic lines in 1968, it was decided to move its French-speaking division, the Université catholique de Louvain, from Leuven (in the Flemish Region) to a new location, some 30 kilometers south, in the Walloon Region. Construction on the town of Louvain-la-Neuve (literally &#x27;New Louvain&#x27;) began in the 1970s, in what had previously been the mostly empty countryside near the village of Ottignies. Its city centre is supported by a concrete structure, allowing car traffic to pass underneath and making the city centre a pedestrian zone.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
* Slobomir is a new town in Republika Srpska and its name means: &quot;the city of freedom and peace&quot;. It is located on the Drina river near Bijeljina. It was founded by Slobodan Pavlović, a Bosnian Serb philanthropist. It aims to be one of the major cities of post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina. In fact, the city will be located in two countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, although majority of it will be in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The city is named after its founder, Slobodan Pavlović, and his wife, Mira.
* Andrićgrad is a town under construction by the famous Serbian director Emir Kusturica, and will be located in Višegrad, Republika Srpska.

===Bulgaria===
The cities of Stara Zagora and Kazanlak, in central Bulgaria, were rebuilt as planned cities after they were burnt to the ground in the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War. Also the city of Dimitrovgrad in south Bulgaria, that was planned as a key industrial and infrastructure center.

===Croatia===
Červar-Porat is a resort town in western Croatia, located on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea on the Červar lagoon. It was built as a planned town in the 1970s, although the area was inhabited in Roman times. During the War of Independence it was used as a camp for refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Vukovar. It was planned to house 6500 people.

Raša in Istria was built as a &quot;new town&quot; during 1936–1937 as part of Mussolini&#x27;s urban colonization of Istria and other Italian territories.

The capital of Zagreb underwent major expansion during the 1960s. By that time, the city&#x27;s official boundary was the river Sava, since nothing was built over it. After a flood in the 1960s, many residents were moved and some other districts were created for the residents, such as Dubrava, which was the interconnection between the Zagreb&#x27;s old part and Sesvete. During the 1960s and 1970s, a planned part of Zagreb, Novi Zagreb (&quot;New Zagreb&quot;), was constructed, which is on the other, previously uninhabited part of the river Sava, and is now one of major districts consisting of purely residential buildings and blocks. It is still under expansion and some new landmarks were built in it, the most famous one being the recent one, Arena Zagreb, built in 2008.

===Czechia===
The New Town of Prague was founded in 1348 by the King and Emperor Charles IV. This expansion made Prague, the new imperial seat, the third largest city in Europe by area at that time.

Poruba and Havířov were established in the 1950s as new satellite residential towns for workers of coal-mining, steel-mill and other heavy-industry complex in the Ostrava region. 

Prague was extended by large housing estates – &quot;new towns&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s: Severní Město (Northern Town), Jižní Město (Southern Town), Jihozápadní Město (South-Western Town) were the largest, with population around 100.000 each. Their remote position to the city centre was compensated for by underground lines constructed usually a decade after the completion of the housing projects. A new housing estate called Západní Město (Western Town) is currently (2017) partly under construction (Britská čtvrť) and partly in planning stage.

===Denmark===
Fredericia was founded in 1650 as a combined market town and military town following the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Similarly, the North Sea port city of Esbjerg was constructed in 1868 following the loss of Altona (now part of Hamburg).

More recent examples are Græse Bakkeby in North Zealand, and Ørestad (a district of Copenhagen), planned and built to strengthen development in the Copenhagen/Malmö region. The suburb of Albertslund was also built from scratch in the 1970s, merging the villages Vridsløselille and Herstedvester.

In 2017, plans for a new 20,000-inhabitant town outside Frederikssund named Vinge were approved by the Danish authorities.

===Finland===
The city of Helsinki, previously a town of 5,000 inhabitants, was made the capital of the new Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812 by decree of Alexander I, Emperor of Russia. The city center was rebuilt with the lead of the German architect Carl Ludvig Engel.

However, the last town in Finland that was ordered to be built on a previously completely uninhabited land was Raahe, founded by governor general Per Brahe the Younger in 1649.

The city of Vaasa was rebuilt about seven kilometers northwest of its original location in 1862, after a fire which destroyed the city in 1852. The new town was planned by Carl Axel Setterberg. The disastrous consequences of the fire were considered as the design included five broad avenues which divided the town into sections and each block was divided by alleys.

Hamina is an old Finnish Eastern trade capital, founded during the Swedish reign. The star-shaped fortress and the circular town plan are based on an Italian Renaissance fortress concept from the 16th century.

Finland also has various &quot;ekokylä&quot; communities or &quot;ecological villages&quot;. For example, Tapiola is a post-war garden city on the edge of Espoo.

Hervanta in Tampere is a satellite city built starting from 1970s to accommodate a growing number of urban residents. It was built far from the city centre due to lower land prices. The district was intended to be as independent as possible. It includes a large university campus, the Police University College of Finland and offices of many technology companies.

===France===
Many new cities, called bastides, were founded from the 12th to 14th centuries in southwestern France, where the Hundred Years War took place, to replace destroyed cities and organize defence and growth. Among those, Monpazier, Beaumont, and Villeréal are good examples.

In 1517, the construction of Le Havre was ordered by Francis I of France as a new port. It was completely destroyed during the Second World War and was entirely rebuilt in a modernist style, during the Trente Glorieuses, the thirty-year period from 1945 to 1975.

Cardinal Richelieu founded the small Baroque town of Richelieu, which remains largely unchanged.

A program of new towns (French &quot;&quot;) was developed in the mid-1960s to try to control the expansion of cities. Ten &quot;villes nouvelles&quot; were created.
* Near Paris: Cergy-Pontoise, Marne-la-Vallée, Sénart (former Melun-Sénart), Évry, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines
* Near Lille: Villeneuve d&#x27;Ascq (Former Lille-Est)
* Near Lyon: L&#x27;Isle-d&#x27;Abeau
* Near Marseille: Rives de l&#x27;Etang de Berre
* Near Rouen: Le Vaudreuil
* Near Grenoble: L&#x27;Isle-d&#x27;Abeau

La Défense, in the greater Paris area, could also be considered a planned town, though it was not built all at once but in successive stages beginning in the 1950s.

===Germany===
Planned cities in Germany are:
* Bayreuth: an example of a medieval new city
* Bremerhaven: founded as a seaport in the 19th century
* Berlin – Friedrichstadt: founded in 1691
* Eisenhüttenstadt: the &quot;first socialist town&quot; in Germany
* Freudenstadt: the roads follow the layout of the nine men&#x27;s morris game
* Glückstadt: founded in 1617 by the Duke of Holstein, King Christian IV of Denmark
* Halle-Neustadt: a &quot;Stadtteil&quot; or borough in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt
* Hellerau: first German garden city founded in 1909, today part of Dresden
* Karlsruhe: the roads follow the layout of a hand-held fan with the castle being at the juncture
* Ludwigsburg: planned new capital for the duke of Württemberg
* Mannheim Quadratestadt: squares named like ranks and files on a chessboard
* Munich Maxvorstadt: the first planned city expansion of Munich was realized from 1805 to 1810 according to a raster
* Neu-Isenburg: founded in 1699 as a town of exiles by French Huguenots
* Neustrelitz: founded in 1733 with streets spreading from an octagonal market place
* Neuwied: founded in 1653 
* Putbus: built around a circular centre with radially aligned streets
* Sennestadt: founded in 1956, today part of Bielefeld
* Wilhelmshaven: founded as a naval base by the Kingdom of Prussia
* Wolfsburg: founded in 1938 to host the factories for the newly built Volkswagen

Welthauptstadt Germania was the projected renewal of Berlin as a planned city, although only a small portion was constructed between 1937 and 1943.

After World War II, several expellee towns were built like Espelkamp, Neutraubling and Traunreut.

===Greece===
Planned cities in Greece are:
*Lakki: planned and built in the 1930s by the Italians to house members of its military stationed on the island of Leros; its initial name was Portolago
* Nea Alikarnassos: founded in 1925 to house Greek refugees from Halicarnassos, Asia Minor
* Orestiada: founded in 1922 to house Greek refugees from Orestiada, Eastern Thrace
* Paralia Distomou: planned and built to house workers of Aluminium of Greece
*Piraeus, planned to be the major port of Athens.
*Sparta: planned and built next to the ancient city, in 1834 after a decree issued by King Otto of Greece

===Hungary===
All Hungarian planned cities were built in the second half of the 20th century when a program of rapid industrialization was implemented by the communist government.

* The area of Budapest was designed in a unique geometrical fashion.
* Dunaújváros, built next to the existing village Dunapentele to provide housing for workers of a large steel factory complex. Once named after Stalin, the city maintains its importance in heavy industry even after the recession following the end of Communist era.
* Tiszaújváros, built next to the existing village Tiszaszederkény and was named after Lenin for decades. A significant chemical factory was built simultaneously.
* Kazincbarcika, created from the villages Sajókazinc, Barcika and Berente (the latter has become independent since then) in a mining area. The city and its population grew fast after the founding of a factory.
* Tatabánya, created from four already existing villages was developed into a mining town and industrial centre and shortly after its elevation to town status became the county seat of its county, a status it still maintains despite the presence of historically more significant towns in the area.
* Beloiannisz (although not a town, only a village) was planned and built in the 1950s to provide home for Greek refugees of the Civil War.
* The Wekerletelep was developed between 1908 and 1925 as a result of planned state construction in the area of Kispest in a unique lacy layout.

===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland the term &quot;new town&quot; is often used to refer to planned towns built after World War II which were discussed as early as 1941. The term &quot;new town&quot; in Ireland was also used for some earlier developments, notably during the Georgian era. Part of Limerick city was built in a planned fashion as &quot;Newtown Pery&quot;.

In 1961 the first new town of Shannon was commenced and a target of 6,000 inhabitants was set. This has since been exceeded. Shannon is of some regional importance today as an economic centre (with the Shannon Free Zone and Shannon Airport), but until recently failed to expand in population as anticipated. Since the late 1990s, and particularly in the early 2000s, the population has been expanding at a much faster rate, with town rejuvenation, new retail and entertainment facilities and many new housing developments.

It was not until 1967 that the Wright Report planned four towns in County Dublin. These were Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Lucan and Tallaght but they were subsequently reduced to Blanchardstown, Lucan-Clondalkin and Tallaght. These areas had previously contained small semi-rural villages on the edge of the city of Dublin, but were greatly expanded throughout the 1970s. Each of these towns has approximately 50,000 inhabitants today.

The most recent new town in Ireland is Adamstown in County Dublin. Building commenced in 2005 and it was anticipated that the occupation would commence late in 2006 with the main development of 10,500 units being completed within a ten-year timescale. As of 2017 Adamstown is complete but currently only has 3,500 out of the 25,500 planned.

===Italy===
A famous example of renaissance planned city is the walled star city of Palmanova. It is a derivative of ideal circular cities, namely of Filarete&#x27;s imaginary Sforzinda.

In the early 20th century, during the fascist government of Benito Mussolini, many new cities were founded, the most prominent being Littoria (renamed Latina after the fall of the Fascism). The city was inaugurated on 18 December 1932. Littoria was populated with immigrants coming from Northern Italy, mainly from Friuli and Veneto.

The great Sicilian earthquake of 1693 forced the complete rebuilding on new plans of many towns.

Other well-known new cities are located close to Milan in the metropolitan area. Crespi d&#x27;Adda, a few kilometres east of Milan along the Adda River, was settled by the Crespi family. It was the first Ideal Worker&#x27;s City in Italy, built close to the cotton factory. Today Crespi d&#x27;Adda is part of the Unesco World Heritage List. Cusano Milanino was settled in the first years of the 20th century in the formerly small town of Cusano. It was built as a new green city, rich in parks, villas, large boulevards and called Milanino (Little Milan).

===Lithuania===
In 1961 Elektrėnai was established as planned city for workers in Elektrėnai Power Plant and in 1975 Visaginas was established as planned city for workers in Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant.

===Malta===
* The fortified cities of Senglea and Valletta were both built on a grid plan by the Knights of Malta in the 16th century.
* The town of Paola, also known as &quot;Raħal Ġdid&quot; (New Town), is built on a grid plan by the Grand Master Antoine de Paule.
* The towns of San Ġwann and Santa Luċija were built as planned cities in the 1960s and 1970s

===Netherlands===
One of the 12 provinces of the Netherlands, Flevoland (pop. 437,000 in 2022), was reclaimed from the Zuiderzee (Southern Sea). After a flood in 1916, it was decided that the Zuiderzee, an inland sea within the Netherlands, would be closed and reclaimed. In 1932, a causeway (the Afsluitdijk) was completed, which closed off the sea completely. The Zuiderzee was subsequently called IJsselmeer (IJssel Lake), and its previously salty water became fresh.

The first part of the new lake that was reclaimed was the Noordoostpolder (Northeast Polder). This new land included, among others, the former island of Urk, and it was included with the province of Overijssel. After this, other parts were also reclaimed: the eastern part in 1957 (Oost-Flevoland) and the southern part (Zuid-Flevoland) in 1968. The municipalities on the three parts voted to become a separate province, which happened in 1986.

The capital of Flevoland is Lelystad, but the biggest city is Almere (pop. 219,000 in 2022), which was founded in 1975. Apart from these two larger cities, several &#x27;new villages&#x27; were built. In the Noordoostpolder, the central town of Emmeloord is surrounded by ten villages, all in cycling distance from Emmeloord since that was the most popular way of transport in the 1940s (and it is still very popular). Most noteworthy of these villages is Nagele which was designed by famous modern architects of the time, Gerrit Rietveld, Aldo van Eyck, Willem Wissing and Jaap Bakema among them. The other villages were built in a more traditional, or vernacular, style. In the more recent Flevolandpolders, four more &#x27;new villages&#x27; were built. Initially, more villages were planned, but the introduction of cars made fewer but larger villages possible.

New towns outside Flevoland are Hoofddorp and IJmuiden near Amsterdam, Hellevoetsluis and Spijkenisse near Rotterdam and the navy port Den Helder. Elburg is an example of a planned city in the medieval period.

The cities of Almere, Capelle aan den IJssel, Haarlemmermeer (also a reclaimed polder, 19th century), Nieuwegein, Purmerend and Zoetermeer are members of the European New Town Platform.

===North Macedonia===

The Municipality of Aerodrom within the city of Skopje is a planned community.

===Norway===
* Oslo: After a great fire in 1624, it was decided by King Christian IV that the city would be moved behind the Akershus fortress. The new town, named Christiania, was laid out in a grid and is now the downtown area known as &quot;Kvadraturen&quot; (&quot;the Quadrature&quot;). The original town of Oslo was later incorporated into Christiania, and is now a neighborhood in eastern Oslo; Gamlebyen or &quot;The Old City&quot;.
* The city of Kristiansand was formally founded in 1641 by King Christian IV. The city was granted all trade privileges on the southern coast of Norway, denying all other towns to trade with foreign states. As Oslo/Christiania before it, the city was behind a fortress, with a grid system allowing cannons to fire towards the two ports of the city and the river on the eastern end.

===Poland===
Four cities stand out as examples of planned communities in Poland: Zamość, Gdynia, Tychy and Nowa Huta. Their very diverse layouts are the result of the different aesthetics that were held as ideal during the development of each of these planned communities. Planned cities in Poland have a long history and fall primarily into three time periods during which planned towns developed in Poland and its neighbors that once comprised the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. These are the Nobleman&#x27;s Republic (16th to 18th centuries), the interwar period (1918–1939) and Socialist Realism (1944–1956).

====The Nobleman&#x27;s Republic of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
The extreme opulence that Poland&#x27;s nobility enjoyed during the Renaissance left Poland&#x27;s elites with not only obscene amounts of money to spend, but also motivated them to find new ways to invest their hefty fortunes out of the grasp of the Royal Treasury. Jan Zamoyski founded the city of Zamość to circumvent royal tariffs and duties while also serving as the capital for his mini-state. Zamość was planned by the renowned Paduan architect Bernardo Morando and modeled on Renaissance theories of the &#x27;ideal city&#x27;. Realizing the importance of trade, Zamoyski issued special location charters for representatives of peoples traditionally engaged in trade, i.e. to Greeks, Armenians and Sephardic Jews and secured exemptions on taxes, customs duties and tolls, which contributed to its fast development. Zamoyski&#x27;s success with Zamość spawned numerous other Polish nobles to found their own &quot;private&quot; cities such as Białystok and many of these towns survive today, while Zamość was added to the UN World Heritage list in 1992 and is today considered one of the most precious urban complexes in Europe and in the world.

====Interwar period====

The preeminent example of a planned community in interwar Poland is Gdynia. After World War I when Poland regained its independence it lacked a commercial seaport (&quot;De iure&quot; Poles could use Gdańsk, which was the main port of the country before the War and is again today, but &quot;de facto&quot; the Germans residing in the city made it almost impossible for them), making it necessary to build one from scratch. The extensive and modern seaport facilities in Gdynia, the most modern and extensive port facilities in Europe at the time, became Poland&#x27;s central port on the Baltic Sea. In the shadow of the port, the city took shape mirroring in its scope the rapid development of 19th-century Chicago, growing from a small fishing village of 1,300 in 1921 into a full blown city with a population over 126,000 less than 20 years later. The Central Business District that developed in Gdynia is a showcase of Art Deco and Modernist architectural styles and predominate much of the cityscape. There are also villas, particularly in the city&#x27;s villa districts such as Kamienna Góra where Historicism inspired Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque architecture.

====Socialist realism====

After the destruction of most Polish cities in World War II, the Communist government that took power in Poland sought to bring about architecture that was in line with its vision of society. Thus urban complexes arose that reflected the ideals of socialist realism. This can be seen in districts of Polish cities such as Warsaw&#x27;s MDM. The City of Nowa Huta (now a district of Kraków) and Tychy were built as the epitome of the proletarian future of Poland.

===Portugal===

Vila Real de Santo António was built after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, on the same model that was used for rebuilding Lisbon, Portugal&#x27;s capital city (also destroyed in the earthquake), and on a similar orthogonal plan.

===Romania===
The cities of Brăila, Giurgiu and Turnu Severin were rebuilt, according to new plans, in the first part of the 19th century and the cities of Alexandria and Călărași were built completely new the same time.
The town of Victoria, located in Brașov County, was built by the communist government starting in the late 1940s. The town of Motru in Oltenia dates to the 1960s.

=== Russia ===
*Saint Petersburg was built by Peter the Great as a planned capital city starting in 1703, particularly due to his interests in seafaring and the pursuit of maritime affairs with Europe, as well as the inconvenient locations of both Moscow and Arkhangelsk, which were two important trade centers at the time. 
*Magnitogorsk is an example of a planned industrial city based on Stalin&#x27;s 1930s five-year plans.
* The Avtozavodsky district of Tolyatti is a planned industrial city of Soviet post-war modernism.
* Kostomuksha was built as a mining town in a Finnish-Russian cooperation in the 1970s–1980s.
*Zelenograd was planned as a center for textile industries and was re-oriented as the center for Soviet electronics and microelectronics. Today, it hosts a computer industry known as the &quot;Soviet/Russian Silicon Valley&quot;, and remains an important center of electronics in modern Russia.

===Serbia===
Novi Beograd, meaning &quot;New Belgrade&quot; in Serbian, is a municipality of the city of Belgrade, built on a previously undeveloped area on the left bank of the Sava river. The first development began in 1947, the municipality has since expanded significantly and become the fastest developing region in Serbia.

Drvengrad, meaning &quot;Wooden Town&quot; in Serbian, is a traditional village that the Serbian film director Emir Kusturica had built for his film &quot;Life Is a Miracle&quot;. It is located in the Zlatibor District near the city of Užice, two hundred kilometers southwest of Serbia&#x27;s capital, Belgrade. It is located near Mokra Gora and Višegrad.

===Slovakia===
* Partizánske was established in 1938–1939, when Jan Antonín Baťa of Zlín, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic) and his powerful network of companies built a shoe factory in the cadastral area of Šimonovany municipality. The newly created settlement for workers carried the name of Baťovany and was part of Šimonovany. With the growth of the factory, so grew the settlement. The whole municipality was renamed to Baťovany in 1948 and given town status. As a sign of recognition of local inhabitants fighting in the Slovak National uprising, the town was renamed Partizánske on 9 February 1949.
* Svit was established in 1934 by business industrialist Jan Antonín Baťa of Zlín, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic) in accordance with his policy of setting up villages around the country for his workers.
*Nová Dubnica is the town planned by architect Jiří Kroha, according to his concept of the ideal town. The construction of the town started in 1951, and while only one third of the original project was finished, the town center still remains one of the prime examples of Stalinist architecture in Slovakia.

===Slovenia===
Nova Gorica, built after 1947 immediately to the east of the new border with Italy, in which the town of Gorizia remained.

===Spain===
During the 16th and 17th centuries, the population of Spain declined due to emigration to the Americas and later kings and governments made efforts to repopulate the country. In the second half of the 18th century, King Charles III implemented the so-called New Settlements (Nuevas Poblaciones) plan which would bring 10,000 immigrants from central Europe to the region of Sierra Morena. Pablo de Olavide was appointed superintendent and about forty new settlements were established of which the most notable was La Carolina, which has a perfectly rectangular grid design.

Later kings and repopulation efforts led to the creation of more settlements, also with rectangular grid plans. One of them was the town of La Isabela (40.4295 N, 2.6876 W), which disappeared in the 1950s submerged under the waters of the newly created artificial lake of Buendía but is still visible just under the water in satellite imagery.

Under Francisco Franco, the Instituto Nacional de Colonización (National Institute of Colonization) built a great number of towns and villages.

Tres Cantos, near Madrid, is a good example of a successful new town design in Spain. It was built in the 1970s.

Newer additional sections of large cities are often newly planned as is the case of the Salamanca district or Ciudad Lineal in Madrid or the Eixample in Barcelona.

===Sweden===

Gothenburg was planned and built as a major fortified city from nothing from 1621.

Karlskrona was also planned and built as a major city and naval base from nothing, beginning 1680.

Vällingby, a suburb, is an example of a new town in Sweden from after 1950.

Kiruna was built because of the large mine, from 1898.

Arvika was also a planned city, in 1811.

Most old planned cities have grown far outside the original planned areas. The new areas were usually (but not always) also planned, but later and separately. Majorna is a near suburb of Gothenburg that was not planned, but grew more ad-hoc, with irregular curvy streets following the topography.

=== Ukraine ===

Odesa was built as a planned city according to 18th-century plans by the Flemish engineer Franz de Wollant (also known as François Sainte de Wollant). The same engineer also planned the following municipalities in Ukraine in the late 18th century:
* Voznesensk (Ukrainian: Вознесенськ), in Mykolayiv Oblast
* Ovidiopol (Ukrainian: Овідіополь), in Odesa Oblast

During its Soviet period, there were number of projects carry out in Ukraine as part of the All-Union urban development programs. In 1920s-1930s cities throughout the Soviet Union were &quot;redeveloped&quot; and had new neighborhoods created known as &quot;Sots-gorodok&quot; or &quot;Sots-misto&quot;. After the World War II that program was discontinued, but number of cities still have some of their neighborhoods named after that program. Some city neighborhoods were developed as hubs for science development and were named as Akademgorodok which could be traced among many cities of the former Soviet Union. There also were built special cities like &quot;Atomgrad&quot; (cities of nuclear scientists), &quot;Goroda Energetikov&quot; (cities of power installers), city-satellites of hydropower plants, etc. (Teplodar, Enerhodar, Pivdennoukrainsk, Svitlodarsk, Svitlovodsk and many others).

Horishni Plavni, founded in the 1960 as &quot;Komsomolsk&quot;, is the most prosperous planned city in Ukraine, depending on the internationally important iron ore mining business. The city was built by method of &quot;community effort&quot; (Soviet Union unpaid labor) and Komsomol activism.

Prypiat is another new city in Ukraine built in 1970. The city was abandoned on 27 April 1986 after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. On 26 April the city had 50,000 habitants, the majority working at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Now the abandoned town is highly contaminated by radiation. Most of the Prypiat&#x27;s former inhabitants were resettled to Slavutych which was planned and built for that purpose.

===United Kingdom===

The Romans planned many towns in Britain, but the settlements were changed out of all recognition in subsequent centuries. The town of Winchelsea is said to be the first post-Roman new town in Britain, constructed to a grid system under the instructions of King Edward I in 1280, and largely completed by 1292. Another claimant to the title is Salisbury, established in the early 13th century by the then Bishop of Sarum. The best known pre-20th-century new town in the UK was undoubtedly the Edinburgh New Town, built in accordance with a 1766 master plan by James Craig, and (along with Bath and Dublin) the archetype of the Georgian style of British architecture.

====England====

The term &quot;new town&quot; often refers in the UK to towns built after World War II under the New Towns Acts. These were influenced by the garden city movement, launched around 1900 by Ebenezer Howard and Sir Patrick Geddes and the work of Raymond Unwin, and manifested at Letchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire.

Following World War II, some 17 projected new towns were designated under the New Towns Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6. c. 68), and were developed partly to house the large numbers of people whose homes had been destroyed by the Luftwaffe during WW2 and partly to move parts of the population out of (mainly Victorian) urban slums. New Towns policy was also informed by a series of wartime commissions, including:
* the Barlow Commission (1940) into the distribution of industrial population,
* the Scott Committee into rural land use (1941)
* the Uthwatt Committee into compensation and betterment (1942)
* (later) the Reith Report into New Towns (1947).

Also crucial to thinking was the Abercrombie Plan for London (1944), which envisaged moving a million and a half people from London to new and expanded towns. (A similar plan was developed for the Clyde Valley in 1946 to combat similar problems faced in Glasgow.) Together these committees reflected a strong consensus to halt the uncontrolled sprawl of London and other large cities. For some, this consensus was tied up with a concern for social welfare reform (typified by the Beveridge Report), as typified in the motto &quot;if we can build better, we can live better&quot;; for others, such as John Betjeman it was a more conservative objection to the changing character of existing towns.

Following the building of Borehamwood, Middlesex, 12 miles north-west of central London, the first in a ring of major &quot;first generation&quot; New Towns around London (1946) were Stevenage, Hertfordshire, 33 miles to the north of London, and Basildon, Essex, 32 miles east of London along the River Thames. Hertfordshire built four other new towns, two in the vicinity of Stevenage (Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield), a third to the north called Letchworth, and Hemel Hempstead to the west. New Towns in the North East were also planned, such as Newton Aycliffe (which the social reformer and government adviser William Beveridge wanted to be the &quot;ideal town to live in&quot;), Washington, Killingworth, Billingham and Peterlee which were in both County Durham and Northumberland (except Washington and Killingworth which are now in Tyne and Wear). Bracknell in Berkshire, to the south-west of London, was designated a New Town in 1949 and is still expanding. Other London new towns from this era include Harlow in Essex and Crawley in West Sussex.

Later, a scatter of &quot;second-generation&quot; towns were built to meet specific problems, such as the development of the Corby Steelworks. Finally, following the New Towns Act 1965, five &quot;third-generation&quot; towns were launched in the late 1960s: these were larger, some of them based on substantial existing settlements such as Peterborough. Probably the most well-known was Milton Keynes designed from the outset to be a new city midway between London and Birmingham, known for its grid network of distributor roads between rather than through neighbourhoods, its G2 listed central park and &quot;covered high street&quot; shopping centre. The 1960s saw new towns being designated around England&#x27;s second-city Birmingham, namely Redditch, Tamworth and Telford.

Other towns, such as Ashford in Kent, Basingstoke in Hampshire and Swindon in Wiltshire, were designated &quot;Expanded Towns&quot; and share many characteristics with the new towns. Scotland also gained three more new towns: Cumbernauld in 1956, noted for its enclosed &#x27;town centre&#x27;, Livingston (1962) and Irvine (1966).

In spite of the relative success of new towns in the London Metropolitan green belt, London continued to suffer from a chronic housing shortage, especially in the south-east. Another small New Town, Thamesmead, was developed adjacent to the Thames in the early 1960s but suffered from poor transport links. Some improvement in infrastructure has been seen subsequently.

All the new towns featured a car-aware layout with many roundabouts and a grid-based road system unusual in the old world. Milton Keynes in particular has a grid-based distributor road system, designed to minimise traffic in residential areas. The earlier new towns, where construction was often rushed and whose inhabitants were generally plucked out of their established communities with little ceremony, rapidly got a poor press reputation as the home of &quot;new town blues&quot;. These issues were systematically addressed in the later towns, with the third generation towns in particular devoting substantial resources to cycle routes, public transport and community facilities, as well as employing teams of officers for social development work.

The financing of the UK new towns was creative. Land within the designated area was acquired at agricultural use value by the development corporation for each town, and infrastructure and building funds borrowed on 60-year terms from the UK Treasury. Interest on these loans was rolled up, in the expectation that the growth in land values caused by the development of the town would eventually allow the loans to be repaid in full. However, the high levels of retail price inflation experienced in the developed world in the 1970s and 1980s fed through into interest rates and frustrated this expectation, so that substantial parts of the loans had ultimately to be written off.

All New Towns designated under the New Towns Act of 1946 were serviced by a secretariat, the New Towns Association, a quango that reported to the New Towns Directorate of the Department of the Environment. It coordinated the work of the General Managers and technical officers, published a monthly information bulletin and provided information for visitors from around the world. As each New Town reached maturity, the town&#x27;s assets were taken over by the Commission for New Towns. Set up in 1948, the New Towns Association was dissolved in 1998. All papers held by it and the Commission for New Towns are held in The National archives:

From the 1970s the first generation towns began to reach their initial growth targets. As they did so, their development corporations were wound up and the assets disposed of: rented housing to the local authority, and other assets to the Commission for New Towns (in England; but alternative arrangements were made in Scotland and Wales). The Thatcher Government, from 1979, saw the new towns as a socialist experiment to be discontinued, and all the development corporations were dissolved by 1992 (with the closure of Milton Keynes Development Corporation), even for the third generation towns whose growth targets were still far from being achieved. Ultimately the Commission for New Towns was also dissolved and its assets – still including a lot of undeveloped land – passed to the English Industrial Estates Corporation (later known as English Partnerships).

Many of the New Towns attempted to incorporate public art and cultural programmes but with mixed methods and results. In Harlow the architect in charge of the design of the new town, Frederick Gibberd, founded the Harlow Art Trust and used it to purchase works by leading sculptors, including Auguste Rodin, Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. In Peterlee the abstract artist Victor Pasmore was appointed part of the design team, which led to the building of the Apollo Pavilion. Washington New Town was provided with a community theatre and art gallery. The public art in Milton Keynes includes the Concrete Cows, which resulted from the work of an &#x27;artist in residence&#x27; and have gone on to become a recognised landmark.

In the 1990s, an experimental &quot;new town&quot;, developed by the Prince of Wales to use very traditional or vernacular architectural styles, was started at Poundbury in Dorset.

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, building of Craigavon in County Armagh commenced in 1966 between Lurgan and Portadown, although entire blocks of flats and shops lay empty, and later derelict, before eventually being bulldozed. It was intended to be the heart of a new linear city incorporating Lurgan and Portadown, but this plan was mostly abandoned and later described as having been flawed.

Derry was the first ever planned city on the island of Ireland. In 1613, Work began on building the new city across the River Foyle from the ancient town of Derry ( or ). The walls were actually completed five years later in 1618. The central diamond (plaza) within a walled city with four gates was thought to be a good design for defence.

====Scotland====
Two &quot;post-war new towns&quot; were planned at East Kilbride (1947) and Glenrothes (1948), then the late 1950s and early 1960s saw the creation of Cumbernauld, Irvine and Livingston. Each of these towns is in Scotland&#x27;s list of 20 most populated towns and cities.
Glenrothes was the first new town in the UK to appoint a town artist in 1968. A massive range of artworks (around 132 in total) ranging from concrete hippos to bronze statues, dancing children, giant flowers, a dinosaur, a horse and chariot and crocodiles, to name but a few, were created. Town artists appointed in Glenrothes include David Harding and Malcolm Robertson.

====Wales====
The only new towns in Wales have been Newtown and Cwmbran. Cwmbran was established to provide new employment in the south eastern portion of the South Wales Coalfield.

==North America and the Caribbean==

===Canada===
When Prime Minister John A. Macdonald began to settle the West in Canada, he put the project under the command of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), which exercised complete control over the development of land under its ownership. The federal government granted every second square mile section (totalling 101,000 km2) along the proposed route to the railway. The railway decided where to place the stations, and thus decided where the dominant town of the area would be. In most instances they built stations on empty sections of land to make the largest profit from land sales – meaning that the CPR founded many towns in western Canada, such as Medicine Hat and Moose Jaw, from scratch. If an existing town was close to the newly constructed station but on land not owned by the railway, the town was forced to move itself to the new site and reconstruct itself, essentially building a new town. Calgary, Alberta and Yorkton, Saskatchewan, were among the towns that had to move themselves.

After the CPR established a station at a particular site, it planned how the town would be constructed. The side of the tracks with the station would go to business, while the other side would go to warehouses. Furthermore, the railway controlled where major buildings went (by giving the town free land to build where they wanted things to go), the construction of roads and the placement and organization of class-structured residential areas.

The CPR&#x27;s influence over the development of the Canadian west&#x27;s communities was one of the earliest examples of new town construction in the modern world. Later influences on planned community development in Canada were the exploitation of mineral and forest wealth, usually in remote locations of the vast country. Among numerous company towns planned and built for these purposes were Corner Brook and Grand Falls in Newfoundland, Témiscaming and Fermont in Quebec.

In the modern suburban context, several &quot;New Towns&quot; were established in the suburbs of large cities. Early examples include Leaside in Toronto and Mount Royal in Montreal. Both were planned and developed by the Canadian Northern Railway as middle class suburbs, though both, Leaside in particular, featured large industrial tracts. Leaside had its own municipal government until 1967, while Mount Royal continues to enjoy autonomy from the City of Montreal.

In the post-war period, new corporate new towns were developed. Bramalea, located in Brampton, Ontario and Erin Mills, located in Mississauga, Ontario, were both developed in phases. Both included residential, commercial and industrial components. Development in Erin Mills continues to this day.

More recently, the Cornell development in Markham, Ontario, was built as a new town, using the concepts of New Urbanism. CityPlace in Toronto is another example of a planned community.

===Mexico===
Tenochtitlan was the capital of the Aztec empire, which was built on an island in Lake Texcoco in what is now the Federal District in central Mexico. The city was largely destroyed in the 1520s by Spanish conquistadores. Mexico City was erected on top of the ruins and, over the ensuing centuries, most of Lake Texcoco has gradually been drained.

Puebla was built because of the need of a Spanish settlement in the route between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz.

Cancun in the state of Quintana Roo is a planned city, considered a tourism destination of global scale. It was transformed from old-growth forest to a well known Mexican destination.

===United States===
====Colonial and pre-Industrial periods====
In the colonial history of the United States, the first planned community was St. Augustine, planned in 1565. The earliest towns in English-speaking America such as Jamestown had only rudimentary elements of planning. The first comprehensively planned town was Charles Town (later Charleston, South Carolina), which was founded in 1670, planned in 1672, and relocated in 1680. Later planned cities included Philadelphia, 1682; Albany, 1695; Williamsburg, 1699; Annapolis, 1718; New York City 1731 (redesigned by the British); Savannah, 1733; New Haven, 1748 (with an early plan dated 1638); and Alexandria, 1749. The national capital (Washington, D.C.), and several state capitals (Jackson, Mississippi; Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; Raleigh, North Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina; Madison, Wisconsin; Salt Lake City, Utah; Tallahassee, Florida; and Austin, Texas) were essentially carved out of the wilderness to serve as capital cities.

The Harmony Society created socialist utopian religious communities in Harmony, Pennsylvania (1804), New Harmony, Indiana (1814), and what is now Old Economy Village in Pennsylvania (1824).

====Industrial Revolution era====
During the early- to mid-19th century, after the success of Slater&#x27;s Mill and mills at Waltham, Massachusetts, wealthy investors such as the Boston Associates bought land on rivers, built dams and textile mills, and created mill towns including Lowell, Lawrence, and Holyoke, Massachusetts.

Pullman, now incorporated into Chicago&#x27;s South Side, was a world-renowned company town founded by the industrialist George M. Pullman in the 1880s.

Venice of America, a California City opened in 1904, founded by Abbot Kinney who saw a swamp like area wetland of land in Los Angeles County as an opportunity to create a visitor destination on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. The entire city was laid out to conform to the contours of natural water runoff which allowed him to dredge mud from the low-lying areas thereby forming canals and with the dirt that was removed in the process, along the sides of the canals raise the elevation high enough to create housing pads.

In Beaver County, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, American Bridge Company founded Ambridge, Pennsylvania in 1905 as a company town for American Bridge; American Bridge is still based near Ambridge today in nearby Coraopolis, Pennsylvania.

Another well-known company town is Gary, Indiana, which was founded in 1906 by the United States Steel Corporation as a home for its new steel mill, the Gary Works, and named after Elbert Henry Gary, the chairman of the company. For many years the Gary Works was the largest steel mill in the world, and it dominated the town, the main entrance being at the northern end of Broadway, the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare. The fortunes of this planned city have historically risen and fallen with those of the steel mill: prosperous in the 1930s, the city has lost 55 percent of its population since 1960.

Riverside, Illinois, Radburn, New Jersey, and Kansas City, Missouri&#x27;s Country Club District are other early examples of planned communities. Riverside is arguably the first planned suburb (as opposed to a stand-alone entity) in the United States, designed in 1869 by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted. The village was incorporated in 1875. Established in 1912, Shaker Heights, Ohio, was planned and developed by the Van Sweringen brothers, railroad moguls who envisioned the community as a suburban retreat from the industrial inner-city of Cleveland. Kohler Company created a planned village of the same name west of the company&#x27;s former headquarters city of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, which incorporated in 1912. In 1918, the Aluminum Company of America built the town of Alcoa, Tennessee for the employees of the nearby aluminum processing plant. Mariemont, Ohio is a town financed in the 1920s by philanthropist Mary Emery, designed as a place for both single-family homes and affordable apartments outside of the inner city.

The Stelton Colony in New Jersey was established as an anarchist community.

====Government-led schemes====
During the Florida land boom of the 1920s in South Florida, the communities of Coral Gables, Opa-locka, and Miami Springs, now suburbs of Miami, were incorporated as fully planned &quot;themed&quot; communities which were to reflect the architecture and look of Spain, Arabia, and Mexico respectively, and are now considered some of the first modern planned communities in the United States. Oldsmar, located in west central Florida, was developed by automobile pioneer Ransom E. Olds.

In 1928, San Clemente, California was incorporated by Ole Hanson who designated that all buildings must be approved by an architectural review board to retain control over development and building style.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, several model towns were planned and built by the Federal government. Arthurdale, Eleanor, and Tygart Valley, West Virginia, federally funded New Deal communities, were Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s projects to ease the burden of the depression on coal miners. The Tennessee Valley Authority created several towns of its own to accommodate workers constructing their new dams; the most prominent being Norris, Tennessee. Three &quot;Greenbelt Communities&quot;, Greenbelt, Maryland, Greenhills, Ohio, and Greendale, Wisconsin, built by the Federal government during the 1930s were planned with a surrounding &quot;belt&quot; of woodland and natural landscaping. Government policy prevented initial settlement by African-Americans in these communities.

During World War II, the Manhattan Project built several planned communities to provide accommodations for scientists, engineers, industrial workers and their families. These communities, including Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Richland, Washington and Los Alamos, New Mexico were necessary because the laboratories and industrial plants of the Manhattan Project were built in isolated locations to ensure secrecy. Even the existence of these towns was a military secret, and the towns themselves were closed to the public until after the war.

====Postwar period====
The Levittowns—in Long Island, Pennsylvania and New Jersey (now known as Willingboro, New Jersey) – typified the planned suburban communities of the 1950s and early 1960s. California&#x27;s Rohnert Park (north of San Francisco) is another example of a planned city (built at the same time as Levittown) that was marketed to attract middle-class people into an area only populated with farmers with the phrase, &quot;A Country Club for the middle class.&quot; Concord Park, Pennsylvania, established in 1954, was intended to be a model racially integrated community, though to accommodate discriminatory attitudes among financiers, the fraction of African-American households was capped at 45%. Parts of Lexington, Massachusetts (Six Moon Hill, Five Fields, Peacock Farm, and Turning Mill / Middle Ridge) were developed along different philosophical linkes, with mid-century modern architecture and semi-communal property, in stages from 1947 to 1967.

====Modern planned cities====

The era of the modern planned city began in 1962–1964 with the creation of Reston, Virginia, followed a year later by Coral Springs, Florida, and Columbia, Maryland. In more recent years, New Urbanism has set the stage for new cities, with places like Seaside, Florida, and Celebration, Florida, developed by The Walt Disney Company.

In the United States, suburban growth in the Sunbelt states has coincided with the popularity of Master Planned Communities within established suburbs. In 1970, Jonathan, Minnesota became the first new town in the United States to receive a guarantee of financial assistance from federal government as part of Title IV of the Housing and Urban Development act of 1968; this community folded in 1979, though remnants of the planned community are still visible today. Las Colinas, established in 1973, was another early example and is still growing. Las Colinas is a master planned community within the Dallas-area city of Irving. In 2006, residents approved changes to deed restrictions to allow greater density of urban mixed-use and residential construction. Also in the 1970s, just north of the existing town of Spring, Texas (north of Houston), oil and gas industry executive George P. Mitchell developed The Woodlands, a major residential and commercial master planned community which is now considered one of the premier residential and business destinations in the Houston area. The Woodlands is still experiencing huge growth to this day. In the 1990s, Cinco Ranch was first developed just south of the existing town of Katy, one of the western suburbs of Houston, and has contributed to the explosive recent growth of Houston&#x27;s suburban west side.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, master planned commercial developments such as Bishop Ranch in San Ramon and Hacienda Business Park in Pleasanton have attracted major corporate tenants to relocate from downtown Oakland and San Francisco; these companies include Safeway, Chevron Corporation and AT&amp;T (as the former Pacific Bell).

Towns such as Mountain House, California, added an additional wrinkle to the movement: to prevent conurbation with nearby cities, they have imposed strict growth boundaries, as well as automatic &quot;circuit breakers&quot; that place moratoriums on residential development if the number of jobs per resident in the town falls below a certain value. Centennial, California, a planned community on a portion of Tejon Ranch halfway between Los Angeles and Bakersfield, incorporates such restrictions to minimize the commuter load on severely congested I-5. Coyote Springs, Nevada, Destiny, Florida and Douglas Ranch in Buckeye, Arizona are amongst the largest communities being planned for the 21st century. A recent twist is the town of Ave Maria, Florida, founded in 2007, which is anchored by a Catholic university and has a large Catholic church in the center of town surrounded by commercial and residential development.

Although the Walt Disney Company divested its interest in Celebration, Florida, in March 2022, the company selected Rancho Mirage, California as the location of its first mixed-use Storyliving by Disney community. Named Cotino, the community is being developed in collaboration with DMB Development of Scottsdale, Arizona.

==South and Central America==

=== Colonial cities in Spanish and Portuguese administration ===
The colonial city was the basic administrative organism of the Portuguese and Spanish viceroyalties in America.

Cities were built and organized according to the Castilian model. Streets were drawn according to a perpendicular layout and in the center was the &quot;Plaza de Armas&quot;, where the local and religious authorities were. Cities can be divided into several categories: administration centers, international ports, regional ports, mining centers, indigenous centers, agricultural centers, presidios, border military centers or religious centers (missions).

Cities, of course, grew and transformed over time. The only example of the original layout of a city from the first decades of the conquest can be seen in the ruins of León Viejo, next to Lake Managua, in Nicaragua. The city was abandoned and moved to its current location before the end of the 16th century.

===Argentina===

La Plata was planned in 1880 to replace Buenos Aires city as the capital of the Buenos Aires Province.

Urban planner Pedro Benoit designed a city layout based on a rationalist conception of urban centers. The city has the shape of a square with a central park and two main diagonal avenues, north–south and east–west. (In addition, there are numerous other shorter diagonals.) This design is copied in a self-similar manner in small blocks of six by six blocks in length. Every six blocks, one finds a small park or square. Other than the diagonals, all streets are on a rectangular grid, and are numbered consecutively.

The designs for the government buildings were chosen in an international architectural competition. Thus, the Governor Palace was designed by Italians, City Hall by Germans, etc. Electric street lighting was installed in 1884, and was the first of its kind in Latin America.

===Brazil===
====Brasília====
 Juscelino Kubitschek, President of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, ordered the construction of Brasília, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasília was part of Juscelino&#x27;s &quot;fifty years of prosperity in five&quot; plan. Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957, with 5550 people competing. Oscar Niemeyer, a close friend, was the chief architect of most public buildings and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer. Brasília was built in 41 months, from 1956 to 21 April 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.
The former capital of Brazil was Rio de Janeiro, and resources tended to be concentrated in the southeast region of Brazil. While the city was built because there was a need for a neutrally located federal capital, the main reason was to promote the development of Brazil&#x27;s hinterland and better integrate the entire territory of Brazil. Brasília is approximately at the geographical center of Brazilian territory.

Lúcio Costa, the city&#x27;s principal architect, designed the city to be shaped like an airplane. Housing and offices are situated on giant superblocks, everything following the original plan. The plan specifies which zones are residential, which zones are commercial, where industries can settle, where official buildings can be built, the maximum height of buildings, etc.

====Belo Horizonte====
 In 1889, Brazil became a republic, and it was agreed that a new state capital of Minas Gerais, in tune with a modern and prosperous Minas Gerais, had to be set. In 1893, due to the climatic and topographic conditions, Curral Del Rey was selected by Minas Gerais governor Afonso Pena among other cities as the location for the new economical and cultural center of the state, under the new name of &quot;Cidade de Minas,&quot; or City of Minas. Aarão Reis, an urbanist from the State of Pará, was then set to design the second planned city of Brazil (the first one is Teresina), and then Cidade de Minas was inaugurated finally in 1897, with many unfinished constructions as the Brazilian Government set a deadline for its completion. Inhabitation of the city was subsidized by the local government, through the concession of free empty lots and funding for building houses. An interesting feature of Reis&#x27; downtown street plan for Belo Horizonte was the inclusion of a symmetrical array of perpendicular and diagonal streets named after Brazilian states and Brazilian indigenous tribes.

====Goiânia====
The plan was for a city of 50,000 with the shape of a concentric radius – streets in the form of a spoke, with the Praça Cívica as the center, with the seats of the state and municipal government – The Palace of Emeralds and the Palace of Campinas. In 1937, a decree was signed transferring the state capital from the Cidade de Goiás to Goiânia. The official inauguration only occurred in 1942 with the presence of the president of the republic, governors, and ministers.

====Other====
Fordlândia was built to be a part of Henry Ford&#x27;s motor company. Originally intended to be a rubber plantation, it failed within several years and is now home to squatting farmers.

Other notable planned cities in Brazil include Teresina (The first one, inaugurated in 1842), Petrópolis, Boa Vista, Palmas, Londrina, and Maringá (the latter two in the state of Paraná).

=== Chile ===
While cities such as Santiago, La Serena or Concepción were planned and built in the Conquista period (16th century), it was in the 18th century when authorities promoted the founding of cities through the Population Office (&quot;&quot;), establishing new planned cities such as Rancagua, Talca or Chillán. After Independence, more planned cities were founded to expedite the consolidation of national sovereignty in remote places, such as Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas and Temuco. In the 20th century onwards there were a few cases, like Coyhaique, though until the 1930s there were private planned communities for mining workers called &quot;oficinas,&quot; such as Sewell or María Elena.

===Panama===
Although Panama City itself is not planned, certain areas are such as Costa del Este, an exclusive high density residential and business area, very close to downtown Panama City. The project combines many skyscrapers with beautiful green areas, and it is close to a highway that connects it to the city center. Other planned areas, but in a lesser degree, are Punta Pacifica and the former Canal Zone.

===Venezuela===
* Guayana City – Bolívar State
: Guyana City is a city in Bolívar State, Venezuela. It lies south of the Orinoco, where the river is joined by the Caroní River. The city, officially founded in 1961, is actually composed of the old town of San Félix at the east and the new town of Puerto Ordaz to the west, which lies on the confluence of the Caroní and Orinoco Rivers and is the site of the Llovizna Falls. There are bridges across the Caroni and a new bridge across the Orinoco (Second Orinoco crossing). The city stretches 40 kilometers along the south bank of the Orinoco. With approximately one million people, it is Venezuela&#x27;s fastest-growing city due to its important iron and steelworks and aluminium industries. The city has a large hydroelectric power plant, Macagua Dam. Guayana City is one of Venezuela&#x27;s five most important ports, since most goods produced in Bolívar are shipped through it, onto the Atlantic Ocean via the Orinoco river. Due to its planned nature, the city has a drastically different feel to it than many other South American cities. The towers of the Alta Vista district recall Barranquilla, and many of the residential neighborhoods have architecture and landscaping that are similar to suburbs in the United States in the 1950s, including &#x27;cookie cutter&#x27; homes, sidewalks, and patterned lawns. This is an artifact due to the presence in the 1960s and early 1970s of US Steel, an American company with iron mining operations in the region. US Steel built housing for hundreds of its American expatriate workers and families, who lived in Puerto Ordaz and other communities until the nationalization of the Venezuelan steel industry forced the company and its workers to leave.

==Oceania==
===Australia===
Australia&#x27;s most prominent fully planned city is Canberra, its capital, designed by American architect Walter Burley Griffin. The early central areas of two state capital cities – Adelaide and Melbourne – were also planned by surveyors. Walter Burley Griffin was Australia&#x27;s most notable city planner, having also designed smaller cities and towns, including Leeton and Griffith in New South Wales. A controversial Japanese-backed planned city, Multifunction Polis, was proposed in the 1980s, but never implemented.

Australia is still building planned communities with developers such as Delfin Lend Lease, an S&amp;P/ASX 50 company, that has been responsible for large master planned communities such as;

* Forest Lake, Queensland, Brisbane (completed 2004)
* The New Rouse Hill, Sydney (current)
* Golden Grove, South Australia (Completed 1991)

====Adelaide====

Adelaide was founded by British and German colonists in 1836 to test out Edward Gibbon Wakefield&#x27;s theories of systematic colonisation. Convict labour was not employed and the colony in theory would be financially self-sufficient; in practice, government assistance was used in the early stages. Land had been sold before any European settlers set foot in the largely unexplored territory and the city (the basis for the future central business district) was surveyed and planned in a remarkably short space of time. Adelaide&#x27;s design has been praised for its four-square layout, its choice of setting and its ample parklands which have had minimal encroachment of developments. The town centre was in sufficient proximity to a water source, the River Torrens.

====Melbourne====

Melbourne was planned as a free settlement in 1837 through the Hoddle Grid, drawn up by Robert Hoddle under instructions from George Gipps, the original plan for Melbourne as part of the first land sales (prior to the planning only a handful of existing settlements were built on the fringe of the grid). The grid featured wide parallel streets, spanning a gently sloping valley between hills (Batman&#x27;s Hill, Flagstaff Hill and Eastern Hill) and roughly parallel to the course of the Yarra River. The deliberate exclusion of city squares or open space within the grid was a subject of future frustration for the municipality and residents. Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, in the centre of the grid, was built over a gully and has therefore been prone to flooding. Despite a later extension and later inclusion of planned suburbs, Melbourne&#x27;s original plans were not as extensive as Adelaide&#x27;s, and the city rapidly outgrew its original boundaries. As such, it is often not considered to be a planned city, but the grid continues to define much of the character of the Melbourne city centre.

====Canberra====

Canberra, established in 1908, was planned as the capital city of Australia and is Australia&#x27;s most notable and ambitious example of civic planning. The city was designed to be the Federal Capital following the federation of the six Australian colonies which formed the Commonwealth of Australia. The new nation required a capital that was located away from other major settlements such as Melbourne and Sydney. Canberra is thus located in a Territory – the Australian Capital Territory – and not a State. Prior to this time the land that Canberra is found on was farming land, indigenous settlements, and forest. In 1912, after an extensive planning competition was completed, the vision of American Walter Burley Griffin was chosen as the winning design for the city. Extensive construction and public works were required to complete the city, this involved the flooding of a large parcel of land to form the center piece of the city, Lake Burley Griffin. Unlike some other Australian cities, the road network, suburbs, parks and other elements of the city were designed in context with each other, rather than haphazard planning as witnessed in much of Sydney. Notable buildings include the High Court, Federal Parliament, Government House, War Memorial, Anzac Parade and headquarters of the Department of Defence.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has several small &quot;new towns&quot;, built for a specific purpose. Examples include Kawerau in the Bay of Plenty (a mill town), Twizel in south Canterbury, Mangakino in the Waikato (both for hydroelectricity), and Tūrangi in the Waikato (for the Tongariro Power Scheme). Construction of Kawerau began in 1953. Twizel was built in 1968 to house workers constructing the Upper Waitaki hydroelectric scheme and was supposed to close on their completion. However, its residents managed to save the town in 1983. Mangakino, constructed from 1946, was also meant to be a temporary construction town, but it too remains today. John Martin, the founder of the Wairarapa town of Martinborough, set out the town&#x27;s first streets in the pattern of the Union Flag in the 19th century.

In 2006, construction began on Pegasus Town, a new planned town adjacent to Woodend, approximately north of Christchurch.

<doc id="194842" wikidata="Q184935" url="?curid=194842" title="Mihai Eminescu">
<text>Mihai Eminescu (; born Mihail Eminovici; 15 January 1850 – 15 June 1889) was a Romanian Romantic poet, novelist, and journalist from Moldavia, generally regarded as the most famous and influential Romanian poet. Eminescu was an active member of the Junimea literary society and worked as an editor for the newspaper &quot;Timpul&quot; (&quot;The Time&quot;), the official newspaper of the Conservative Party (1880–1918). His poetry was first published when he was 16 and he went to Vienna, Austria to study when he was 19. The poet&#x27;s manuscripts, containing 46 volumes and approximately 14,000 pages, were offered by Titu Maiorescu as a gift to the Romanian Academy during the meeting that was held on 25 January 1902. Notable works include &quot;Luceafărul&quot; (&quot;The Vesper/The Evening Star/The Lucifer/The Daystar&quot;), &quot;Odă în metru antic&quot; (&quot;Ode in Ancient Meter&quot;), and the five &quot;Letters&quot; (&quot;Epistles/Satires&quot;). In his poems, he frequently used metaphysical, mythological and historical subjects.

His father was Gheorghe Eminovici, an aristocrat from Bukovina, which was then part of the Austrian Empire (while his grandfather came from Banat). He crossed the border into Moldavia, settling in Ipotești, near the town of Botoșani. He married Raluca Iurașcu, an heiress of an old noble family. In a Junimea register, Eminescu wrote down his birth date as 22 December 1849, while in the documents of Cernăuți Gymnasium, where Eminescu studied, his birth date is 15 January 1850. Nevertheless, Titu Maiorescu, in his work &quot;Eminescu and His Poems&quot; (1889), quoted N. D. Giurescu&#x27;s research and adopted his conclusion regarding the date and place of Mihai Eminescu&#x27;s birth, as being 15 January 1850, in Botoșani. This date resulted from several sources, among which there was a file of notes on christenings from the archives of the Uspenia (Princely) Church of Botoșani; inside this file, the date of birth was &quot;15 January 1850&quot; and the date of christening was the 21st of the same month. The date of his birth was confirmed by the poet&#x27;s elder sister, Aglae Drogli, who affirmed that the place of birth was the village of Ipotești, Botoșani County.

==Family==
The most accepted theory is that Mihail&#x27;s paternal ancestors came from a Romanian family from Banat. In 1675, a child was born with the name Iminul. The son of Iminul was Iovul lui Iminul, born in 1705, who was ordained a priest under the Serbianized name of Iovul Iminovici, in accordance with the use of Church Slavonic of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci.

The priest Iovul Iminovici left Banat for Blaj between 1738-1740, attracted by civil liberties, agricultural land for a fee and free education in the Romanian language for his children, but on the condition of becoming an Eastern-Rite Catholic. Iovul Iminovici had two sons, Iosif and Petrea Iminovici. Petrea Eminovici, the poet&#x27;s great-grandfather, was probably born in 1735 and from his marriage with Agafia Şerban (born in 1736), several descendants appeared, known with certainty being only the existence of their middle child, Vasile, the grandfather of the poet. Vasile Iminovici, born in 1778, attended the normal school in Blaj and married Ioana Sărghei. After a while, the spouses Petrea and Agafia divorced. Petrea died in Blaj in 1811, and Agafia accompanied the family of her son, Vasile, to Bukovina. Agafia died in 1818 in Călinești, Suceava.

Vasile Iminovici, attracted by the economic and social conditions settled in Bukovina, moved with his family to Călinești in 1804, where he received a position as a church teacher as well as land. He had four daughters and three sons. Vasile Iminovici died in 1844. The eldest of his sons, Gheorghe, born in 1812 was the father of Mihai Eminescu. Gheorghe Eminovici was in the service of the boyar Ioan Ienacaki Cârstea from Costâna, Suceava, then - writer for baron Jean Mustață from Bukovina, and later in the service of the boyar Alexandru Balș from Moldova. After the death of Alexandru Balș, his son, Costache, appointed Gheorghe Eminovici as administrator of the Dumbrăveni estate. Later, Gheorghe Eminovici obtained the title of sluger from Costache Balș.

Another theory from the historian George Călinescu says that Mihai&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather might have been a cavalry officer from the army of Charles XII of Sweden, who settled in Moldavia after the battle of Poltava (1709).

Raluca, the poet&#x27;s mother, was the fourth daughter of Vasile and Paraschiva Jurașcu. The ancestors from his mother&#x27;s side, the Jurăscești family, came from Hotin (part of Greater Romania from 1918-1940, present-day Ukraine, near the border with Romania). The boyar Vasile Jurașcu from Joldești, Botoșani County married Paraschiva, the daughter of Donțu, a Cossack, who had settled on the banks of the Siret, not far from the village of Sarafinești, Botoșani County. Donțu married Catrina, the daughter of the Romanian peasant Ion Brehuescu. 

Gheorghe Eminovici married Raluca Jurașcu in 1840, receiving a substantial dowry, and in 1841 he received the title of căminar (a type of boyar) from the prince ruler of Moldavia, Mihail Sturdza.

== Life ==

===Early years===

Mihail (as he appears in baptismal records) or Mihai (the more common form of the name that he used) was born in Botoșani, Moldavia. Mihai Eminescu was the seventh of the eleven children of Gheorghe Eminovici and Raluca Jurașcu. He spent his early childhood in Botoșani and Ipotești, in his parents family home. From 1858 to 1866 he attended school in Cernăuți. He finished 4th grade as the 5th of 82 students, after which he attended two years of &quot;gymnasium&quot;.

The first evidence of Eminescu as a writer is in 1866. In January of that year Romanian teacher Aron Pumnul died and his students in Cernăuţi published a pamphlet, &quot;Lăcrămioarele învățăceilor gimnaziaști&quot; (&quot;The Tears of the Gymnasium Students&quot;) in which a poem entitled &quot;La mormântul lui Aron Pumnul&quot; (&quot;At the Grave of Aron Pumnul&quot;) appears, signed &quot;M. Eminovici&quot;. On 25 February his poem &quot;De-aș avea&quot; (&quot;If I Had&quot;) was published in Iosif Vulcan&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;Familia&quot; in Pest. This began a steady series of published poems (and the occasional translation from German). Also, it was Iosif Vulcan, who disliked the Slavic source suffix &quot;-ici&quot; of the young poet&#x27;s last name, that chose for him the more apparent Romanian &quot;nom de plume&quot; &quot;Mihai Eminescu&quot;.

In 1867, he joined Iorgu Caragiale&#x27;s troupe as a clerk and prompter; the next year he transferred to Mihai Pascaly&#x27;s troupe. Both of these were among the leading Romanian theatrical troupes of their day, the latter including Matei Millo and . He soon settled in Bucharest, where at the end of November he became a clerk and copyist for the National Theater. Throughout this period, he continued to write and publish poems. He also paid his rent by translating hundreds of pages of a book by Heinrich Theodor Rötscher, although this never resulted in a completed work. Also at this time he began his novel &quot;Geniu pustiu&quot; (&quot;Wasted Genius&quot;), published posthumously in 1904 in an unfinished form.

On 1 April 1869, he was one of the co-founders of the &quot;Orient&quot; literary circle, whose interests included the gathering of Romanian folklore and documents relating to Romanian literary history. On 29 June, various members of the &quot;Orient&quot; group were commissioned to go to different provinces. Eminescu was assigned Moldavia. That summer, he quite by chance ran into his brother Iorgu, a military officer, in Cișmigiu Gardens, but firmly rebuffed Iorgu&#x27;s attempt to get him to renew his ties to his family. 

Still in the summer of 1869, he left Pascaly&#x27;s troupe and traveled to Cernăuţi and Iaşi. He renewed ties to his family; his father promised him a regular allowance to pursue studies in Vienna in the fall. As always, he continued to write and publish poetry; notably, on the occasion of the death of the former ruler of Wallachia, Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei, he published a leaflet, &quot;La moartea principelui Știrbei&quot; (&quot;On the Death of Prince Știrbei&quot;).

===1870s===
From October 1869 to 1872 Eminescu studied at the University of Vienna. Not fulfilling the requirements to become a university student (as he did not have a baccalaureate degree), he attended lectures as a so-called &quot;extraordinary auditor&quot; at the Faculty of Philosophy and Law. He was active in student life, befriended Ioan Slavici, and came to know Vienna through Veronica Micle; he became a contributor to &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot; (&quot;Literary Conversations&quot;), edited by &quot;Junimea&quot; (&quot;The Youth&quot;). The leaders of this cultural organisation, Petre P. Carp, Vasile Pogor, Theodor Rosetti, Iacob Negruzzi and Titu Maiorescu, exercised their political and cultural influence over Eminescu for the rest of his life. Impressed by one of Eminescu&#x27;s poems, &quot;Venere şi Madonă&quot; (&quot;Venus and Madonna&quot;), Iacob Negruzzi, the editor of &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot;, traveled to Vienna to meet him. Negruzzi would later write how he could pick Eminescu out of a crowd of young people in a Viennese café by his &quot;romantic&quot; appearance: long hair and gaze lost in thoughts.

In 1870 Eminescu wrote three articles under the pseudonym &quot;Varro&quot; in &quot;Federaţiunea&quot; in Pest, on the situation of Romanians and other minorities in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He then became a journalist for the newspaper &quot;Albina&quot; (&quot;The Bee&quot;) in Pest. From 1872 to 1874 he continued as a student in Berlin, thanks to a stipend offered by &quot;Junimea&quot;.

From 1874 to 1877, he worked as director of the Central Library in Iași, substitute teacher, school inspector for the counties of Iași and Vaslui, and editor of the newspaper &quot;Curierul de Iași&quot; (&quot;The Courier of Iaşi&quot;), all thanks to his friendship with Titu Maiorescu, the leader of Junimea and rector of the University of Iași. He continued to publish in &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot;. He also was a good friend of Ion Creangă, a writer, whom he convinced to become a writer and introduced to the &quot;Junimea&quot; literary club.

In 1877 he moved to Bucharest, where until 1883 he was first journalist, then (1880) editor-in-chief of the newspaper &quot;Timpul&quot; (&quot;The Time&quot;). During this time he wrote &quot;Scrisorile&quot;, &quot;Luceafărul&quot;, &quot;Odă în metru antic&quot; etc. Most of his notable editorial pieces belong to this period, when Romania was fighting the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 and throughout the diplomatic race that eventually brought about the international recognition of Romanian independence, but under the condition of bestowing Romanian citizenship to all subjects of Jewish faith. Eminescu opposed this and another clause of the Treaty of Berlin: Romania&#x27;s having to give southern Bessarabia to Russia in exchange for Northern Dobruja, a former Ottoman province on the Black Sea.

===Later life and death===
The 1880s were a time of crisis and deterioration in the poet&#x27;s life, culminating with his death in 1889. The details of this are still debated.

From 1883 – when Eminescu&#x27;s personal crisis and his more problematic health issues became evident – until 1886, the poet was treated in Austria and Italy, by specialists that managed to get him on his feet, as testified by his good friend, writer Ioan Slavici. In 1886, Eminescu suffered a nervous breakdown and was treated by Romanian doctors, in particular Julian Bogdan and Panait Zosin. Immediately diagnosed with syphilis, after being hospitalized in a nervous diseases hospice within the Neamț Monastery, the poet was treated with mercury. Firstly, massages in Botoșani, applied by Dr. Itszak, and then in Bucharest at Dr. Alexandru A. Suțu&#x27;s sanatorium, where between February–June 1889 he was injected with mercuric chloride. Professor Doctor Irinel Popescu, corresponding member of the Romanian Academy and president of the Academy of Medical Sciences of Romania, states that Eminescu died because of mercury poisoning. He also says that the poet was &quot;treated&quot; by a group of incompetent doctors and held in misery, which also shortened his life. Mercury was prohibited as treatment of syphilis in Western Europe in the 19th century, because of its adverse effects.

Mihai Eminescu died at 4 am, on 15 June 1889 at the Caritas Institute, a sanatorium run by Dr. Suțu and located on Plantelor Street Sector 2, Bucharest. Eminescu&#x27;s last wish was a glass of milk, which the attending doctor slipped through the metallic peephole of the &quot;cell&quot; where he spent the last hours of his life. In response to this favor he was said to have whispered, &quot;I&#x27;m crumbled&quot;. The next day, on 16 June 1889 he was officially declared deceased and legal papers to that effect were prepared by doctors Suțu and Petrescu, who submitted the official report. This paperwork is seen as ambiguous, because the poet&#x27;s cause of death is not clearly stated and there was no indication of any other underlying condition that may have so suddenly resulted in his death. In fact both the poet&#x27;s medical file and autopsy report indicate symptoms of a mental and not physical disorder. Moreover, at the autopsy performed by Dr. Tomescu and then by Dr. Marinescu from the laboratory at Babeș-Bolyai University, the brain could not be studied, because a nurse inadvertently forgot it on an open window, where it quickly decomposed.

One of the first hypotheses that disagreed with the post mortem findings for Eminescu&#x27;s cause of death was printed on 28 June 1926 in an article from the newspaper &quot;Universul&quot;. This article forwards the hypothesis that Eminescu died after another patient, Petre Poenaru, former headmaster in Craiova, hit him in the head with a board.

Dr. Vineș, the physician assigned to Eminescu at Caritas argued at that time that the poet&#x27;s death was the result of an infection secondary to his head injury. Specifically, he says that the head wound was infected, turning into an erysipelas, which then spread to the face, neck, upper limbs, thorax, and abdomen. In the same report, cited by Nicolae Georgescu in his work, &quot;Eminescu târziu&quot;, Vineș states that &quot;Eminescu&#x27;s death was not due to head trauma occurred 25 days earlier and which had healed completely, but was the consequence of an older endocarditis (diagnosed by late professor N. Tomescu)&quot;.

Contemporary specialists, primarily physicians who have dealt with the Eminescu case, reject both hypotheses on the cause of death of the poet. According to them, the poet died of cardio-respiratory arrest caused by mercury poisoning. Eminescu was wrongly diagnosed and treated, aiming his removal from public life, as some eminescologists claim. Eminescu was diagnosed since 1886 by Dr. Julian Bogdan from Iași as syphilitic, paralytic and on the verge of dementia due to alcohol abuse and syphilitic gummas emerged on the brain. The same diagnosis is given by Dr. Panait Zosin, who consulted Eminescu on 6 November 1886 and wrote that patient Eminescu suffered from a &quot;mental alienation&quot;, caused by the emergence of syphilis and worsened by alcoholism. Further research showed that the poet was not suffering from syphilis.

==Works==
Nicolae Iorga, the Romanian historian, considers Eminescu the godfather of the modern Romanian language, in the same way that Shakespeare is seen to have directly influenced the English language. He is unanimously celebrated as the greatest and most representative Romanian poet.

&quot;Poems and Prose of Mihai Eminescu&quot; (editor: , publisher: The Center for Romanian Studies, Iași, Oxford, and Portland, 2000, ) contains a selection of English-language renditions of Eminescu&#x27;s poems and prose.

===Poetry===
His poems span a large range of themes, from nature and love to hate and social commentary. His childhood years were evoked in his later poetry with deep nostalgia.

Eminescu&#x27;s poems have been translated in over 60 languages. His life, work and poetry strongly influenced the Romanian culture and his poems are widely studied in Romanian public schools.

==Romanian culture==
Eminescu was only 20 when Titu Maiorescu, the top literary critic in Romania, dubbed him &quot;a real poet&quot;, in an essay where only a handful of the Romanian poets of the time were spared Maiorescu&#x27;s harsh criticism. In the following decade, Eminescu&#x27;s notability as a poet grew continually thanks to (1) the way he managed to enrich the literary language with words and phrases from all Romanian regions, from old texts, and with new words that he coined from his wide philosophical readings; (2) the use of bold metaphors, much too rare in earlier Romanian poetry; (3) last but not least, he was arguably the first Romanian writer who published in all Romanian provinces and was constantly interested in the problems of Romanians everywhere. He defined himself as a Romantic, in a poem addressed &quot;To My Critics&quot; (&quot;Criticilor mei&quot;), and this designation, his untimely death as well as his bohemian lifestyle (he never pursued a degree, a position, a wife or fortune) had him associated with the Romantic figure of the genius. As early as the late 1880s, Eminescu had a group of faithful followers. His 1883 poem &quot;Luceafărul&quot; was so notable that a new literary review took its name after it.

The most realistic psychological analysis of Eminescu was written by I. L. Caragiale, who, after the poet&#x27;s death published three short articles on this subject: &quot;In Nirvana&quot;, &quot;Irony&quot; and &quot;Two notes&quot;. Caragiale stated that Eminescu&#x27;s characteristic feature was the fact that &quot;he had an excessively unique nature&quot;. Eminescu&#x27;s life was a continuous oscillation between introvert and extrovert attitudes.

The portrait that Titu Maiorescu made in the study &quot;Eminescu and poems&quot; emphasizes Eminescu&#x27;s introvert dominant traits. Titu Maiorescu promoted the image of a dreamer who was far away from reality, who did not suffer because of the material conditions that he lived in, regardless of all the ironies and eulogies of his neighbour, his main characteristic was &quot;abstract serenity&quot;.

In reality, just as one can discover from his poems and letters and just as Caragiale remembered, Eminescu was seldom influenced by boisterous subconscious motivations. Eminescu&#x27;s life was but an overlap of different-sized cycles, made of sudden bursts that were nurtured by dreams and crises due to the impact with reality. The cycles could last from a few hours or days to weeks or months, depending on the importance of events, or could even last longer, when they were linked to the events that significantly marked his life, such as his relation with Veronica, his political activity during his years as a student, or the fact that he attended the gatherings at the &quot;Junimea&quot; society or the articles he published in the newspaper &quot;Timpul&quot;. He used to have a unique manner of describing his own crisis of jealousy.

===National poet===
Eminescu was soon proclaimed Romania&#x27;s national poet, not because he wrote in an age of national revival, but rather because he was received as an author of paramount significance by Romanians in all provinces. Even today, he is considered the national poet of Romania, Moldova, and of the Romanians who live in Bukovina ().

=== Iconography ===

Eminescu is omnipresent in today&#x27;s Romania. His statues are everywhere; his face was on the 1000-lei banknotes issued in 1991, 1992, and 1998, and is on the 500-lei banknote issued in 2005 as the highest-denominated Romanian banknote (see Romanian leu); Eminescu&#x27;s Linden Tree is one of the country&#x27;s most famous natural landmarks, while many schools and other institutions are named after him. The anniversaries of his birth and death are celebrated each year in many Romanian cities, and they became national celebrations in 1989 (the centennial of his death) and 2000 (150 years after his birth, proclaimed Eminescu&#x27;s Year in Romania).

Several young Romanian writers provoked a huge scandal when they wrote about &quot;their&quot; demystified idea of Eminescu and went so far as to reject the &quot;official&quot; interpretation of his work.

===International legacy===
Romanian composer Didia Saint Georges (1888-1979) used Eminescu’s text for her songs.

A monument jointly dedicated to Eminescu and Allama Iqbal was erected in Islamabad, Pakistan on 15 January 2004, commemorating Pakistani-Romanian ties, as well as the dialogue between civilizations which is possible through the cross-cultural appreciation of their poetic legacies.

Composer Rodica Sutzu used Eminescu&#x27;s text for her song “Gazel, opus 15.”

In 2004, the Mihai Eminescu Statue was erected in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

On 8 April 2008, a crater on the planet Mercury was named for him.

A boulevard passing by the Romanian embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria is named after Eminescu.

Academia Internationala presents &quot;Mihai Eminescu&quot; Academy Awards. In 2012, one of the winners, the Japanese artist Shogoro Shogoro hosted a tea ceremony to honor Mihai. 

In 2021, the Dutch artist Kasper Peters performs a theater show entitled &quot;Eminescu&quot;, dedicated to the poet.

In May 2024, the first Eminescu sculpture was opened in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan.

In Romania, there are at least 133 monuments (statues and busts) dedicated to Mihai Eminescu. Most of these are located in the region of Moldova (42), followed by Transylvania (32). In Muntenia, there are 21 such monuments, while in Oltenia Eminescu is commemorated through 11 busts. The remaining monuments are placed in Crișana (8), Maramureș (7), and Dobrogea (3).

==Political views==
Due to his conservative nationalistic views, Eminescu was easily adopted as an icon by the Romanian right.

After a decade when Eminescu&#x27;s works were criticized as &quot;mystic&quot; and &quot;bourgeois&quot;, Romanian Communists ended by adopting Eminescu as &quot;the&quot; major Romanian poet. What opened the door for this thaw was the poem &quot;Împărat și proletar&quot; (&quot;Emperor and proletarian&quot;) that Eminescu wrote under the influence of the 1870–1871 events in France, and which ended in a Schopenhauerian critique of human life. An expurgated version only showed the stanzas that could present Eminescu as a poet interested in the fate of proletarians.

It has also been revealed that Eminescu demanded strong anti-Jewish legislation on the German model, saying, among other things, that &quot;the Jew does not deserve any rights anywhere in Europe because he is not working&quot;. This was a fairly usual stance in the cultural and literary milieu of his age.
