<text>The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class of guided-missile destroyers (DDGs) is a United States Navy class of destroyer centered around the Aegis Combat System and the SPY-1D multi-function passive electronically scanned array radar. The class is named after Arleigh Burke, an American destroyer admiral in World War II and later Chief of Naval Operations. With an overall length of , displacement ranging from 8,300 to 9,700 tons, and weaponry including over 90 missiles, the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers are larger and more heavily armed than many previous classes of guided-missile cruisers.

These warships are multi-mission destroyers able to conduct anti-aircraft warfare with Aegis and surface-to-air missiles; tactical land strikes with Tomahawk missiles; anti-submarine warfare (ASW) with towed array sonar, anti-submarine rockets, and ASW helicopters; and anti-surface warfare (ASuW) with ship-to-ship missiles and guns. With upgrades to their AN/SPY-1 radar systems and their associated missile payloads as part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, as well as the introduction of the AN/SPY-6 radar system, the class has also evolved capability as mobile anti-ballistic missile and anti-satellite platforms.

The lead ship of the class, , was commissioned during Admiral Burke&#x27;s lifetime on 4 July 1991. With the decommissioning of the last , , on 2005, the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class ships became the U.S. Navy&#x27;s only active destroyers until the became active in 2016. The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class has the longest production run of any U.S. Navy surface combatant. all seventy-four built are active, with nineteen more planned to enter service.

==Characteristics==
===Variants===
The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer has four variants, referred to as &quot;Flights&quot;. Newer Flights incorporate technological advancements. 
*Flight I: DDGs 51–71
*Flight II: DDGs 72–78
*Flight IIA: DDGs 79–124 and DDG 127
*Flight III: DDGs 125–126 and DDG 128 onwards

===Structure===
The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class ships are among the largest destroyers built in the United States; only the , (), and classes () are longer. The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class was designed with a new large, water-plane area-hull form characterized by a wide flaring bow, which significantly improves seakeeping ability and permits high speed in high sea states. The class&#x27;s design incorporates stealth techniques, such as the angled (rather than traditional vertical) surfaces and the raked tripod mainmast, which make the ship more difficult to detect by radar.

Its designers incorporated lessons from the , which the Navy deemed too expensive to continue building and difficult to upgrade further. For these destroyers, the U.S. Navy returned to all-steel construction, except the mast made of aluminum. The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;s had combined a steel hull with a superstructure made of lighter aluminum to reduce top weight, but the lighter metal proved vulnerable to cracking. Aluminum is also less fire-resistant than steel; a 1975 fire aboard gutted her aluminum superstructure. Battle damage to Royal Navy ships exacerbated by their aluminum superstructures during the 1982 Falklands War supported the decision to use steel. Other lessons from the Falklands War led to the Navy&#x27;s decision to protect the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class&#x27;s vital spaces with double-spaced steel layers, which create a buffer against anti-ship missiles (AShMs), and Kevlar spall liners. A design study called &quot;Cruiser Baseline&quot; was made for a ship that would incorporate the capabilities of the VLS-capable &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class on a hull and superstructure designed to the same standards as the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;, although this study was for analytical purposes only and no such ship was built.

===Passive defenses===
&quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; destroyers are equipped with AN/SLQ-32 electronic warfare (EW) suites that provide electronic support. Vessels with the SLQ-32(V)3, SLQ-32(V)6, or SLQ-32(V)7 variant can jam radars.

The destroyers have Mark 36 infrared and chaff decoy launchers, as well as Nulka decoy launchers, for spoofing incoming AShMs. For defeating incoming torpedoes, the class has two AN/SLQ-25 Nixie towed countermeasures. The ships&#x27; Prairie-Maskers can reduce their radiated noise.

A collective protection system makes the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class the first U.S. warships designed with an air-filtration system against nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare (NBC). Other NBC defenses include double air-locked hatches, pressurized compartments, and an external countermeasure washdown system. The class&#x27;s electronics are hardened against electromagnetic pulses. Fire suppression equipment includes water sprinklers in the living quarters and combat information center (CIC). 

===Weapon systems===
The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class are multi-mission ships with numerous combat systems, including anti-aircraft missiles, land attack missiles, ship-to-ship missiles, and an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) system. Missiles are stored in and fired from Mark 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) cells; with 90 cells on Flights I–II and 96 cells starting with Flight IIA, the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;s are more heavily armed than many preceding guided-missile cruiser classes. The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer is equipped with the Aegis Combat System, which combines information from the ship&#x27;s sensors to display a coherent image of the environment and guides weapons to targets using advanced tracking and fire control.

Their main radar differs from traditional mechanically rotating radars. Instead, Aegis uses the AN/SPY-1D passive electronically scanned array (or the AN/SPY-6 active electronically scanned array on Flight III ships), which allows continual tracking of targets simultaneous to area scans. The system&#x27;s computer control also allows centralization of the previously separate tracking and targeting functions. The system is resistant to electronic countermeasures.

The Standard Missile SM-2MR/ER and SM-6 provide area air defense, though they may also be used in a secondary anti-ship role. The SM-2 uses semi-active radar homing (SARH); up to three targets may be simultaneously intercepted as the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;s have three AN/SPG-62 fire-control radars for terminal target illumination. The SM-6, which provides over-the-horizon defense, and the SM-2 Block IIIC feature a dual-mode seeker with active radar homing (ARH) capability; they do not have to rely on external illumination, so more targets may be intercepted simultaneously.

Flights IIA and III—and modernized Flight I and II ships—can carry RIM-162 Evolved SeaSparrow Missiles (ESSMs), which provide medium-range air defense and are also capable of targeting other ships. ESSM is small enough to be quad-packed into a single Mk 41 VLS cell. ESSM Block 1 uses SARH, guided similarly to older SM-2s. ESSM Block 2, which achieved initial operating capability (IOC) in 2021, features a dual-mode seeker with ARH capability.

The SM-3, SM-6, and SM-2ER Block IV provide Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), the SM-3 being an exoatmospheric interceptor and the latter two having terminal phase anti-ballistic capability. So vital has the Aegis BMD role become that all ships of the class are being updated with BMD capability. By January 2023, there were 51 BMD-capable &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers. Flight III ships have been delivered since 2023 with AN/SPY-6(V)1 radars and improved BMD capabilities; Flight IIA ships are also planned to receive these upgrades with AN/SPY-6(V)4 radar retrofits.

Flights I and II carry two stand-alone Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers for a total of four or eight Harpoons, providing an anti-ship capability with a range in excess of . During Exercise RIMPAC 2024, DDG-62, a Flight I ship, launched a Naval Strike Missile (NSM); the launchers for the Harpoons were removed to make room for the NSM&#x27;s proprietary launch boxes.

The class can perform tactical land strikes with VLS-launched Tomahawks. With the development of the Tomahawk Block V, all existing Block IV Tomahawks carried will be converted to the Block V. The Tomahawk Block Va version is called the Maritime Strike version, and it provides anti-ship capability in addition to its land attack role. The Block Vb version features the Joint Multi-Effects Warhead System for hitting a wider variety of land targets.

&quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class ships have the AN/SQQ-89 ASW combat system, which is integrated with Aegis. It encompasses the AN/SQS-53C bow-mounted sonar and a towed array sonar, though several Flight IIA ships do not have a towed array. The towed array is either the AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array Sonar (TACTAS) or the newer TB-37U Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA). The ships can carry standoff RUM-139 vertical launch anti-submarine rockets. A Mark 32 triple torpedo tubes mount on each side of the ship can fire Mark 46, Mark 50, or Mark 54 lightweight torpedoes for short-range ASW. The ships can detect anti-ship mines at a range of about 1,400 meters.

All ships of the class are fitted with at least one Phalanx close-in weapon system (CIWS), which provides point defense against air and surface threats. Eight ships (DDG 51, DDG 64, DDG 71, DDG 75, DDG 78, DDG 80, DDG 84, DDG 117) are equipped with one SeaRAM CIWS for improved self-defense. &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;s can also carry two 25 mm Mk 38 machine gun systems, one on each side of the ship, designed to counter fast surface craft. There are numerous mounts for crew-served weapons like the M2 Browning.

Located on the forward deck is the 5-inch (127 mm) Mark 45 gun. Directed by the Mark 34 Gun Weapon System, it can be used in anti-ship, anti-air, and naval gunfire support (NGFS) roles. It can fire 16–20 rounds per minute and has a range of . &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;s can stow 680 5-inch rounds.

As of 2023, six destroyers (DDG 100, DDG 104, DDG 105, DDG 106, DDG 111, DDG 113) are equipped with the Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN), a directed energy weapon that can target unmanned vehicles. DDG 88 is equipped with the higher-power High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance (HELIOS).

===Aircraft===
Flights IIA and III have two hangars for stowing MH-60 helicopters. Their Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopter system improves the ship&#x27;s capabilities by enabling the MH-60 to monitor submarines and surface ships, launch torpedoes and missiles against them, and provide fire support during insertions/extractions with machine guns and Hellfire anti-armor guided missiles. The helicopters also serve in a utility role, able to perform vertical replenishment, search and rescue, medical evacuation, communications relay, and naval gunfire spotting and controlling.

In March 2022, an &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; destroyer was deployed with an AAI Aerosonde unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The aircraft is under demonstration for Flight I and II ships, which do not have accommodations for permanently storing helicopters. The Aerosonde has a small enough footprint to be stowed on those destroyers. It can perform missions such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance at a much lower cost than manned helicopters.

==Development==
=== Origins and Flight I ===
The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) from 1970 to 1974, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, sought to improve the U.S. Navy through modernization at minimal cost. Zumwalt&#x27;s approach to the fleet was a &quot;high-low mix&quot;—a few high-end, high-cost warships supplemented by numerous low-end, low-cost warships. The introduction of the Aegis-equipped &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser in the early 1980s filled the high end. The Navy started work to develop a lower-cost Aegis-equipped vessel to fill the low end and replace the aging destroyers.

In 1980, the U.S. Navy initiated design studies with seven contractors. By 1983, the number of competitors had been reduced to three: Bath Iron Works, Ingalls Shipbuilding, and Todd Shipyards. On 3 April 1985, Bath Iron Works received a US$321.9 million contract to build the first of the class, USS &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;. Gibbs &amp; Cox was awarded the contract to be the lead ship design agent. The Navy contracted Ingalls Shipbuilding to build the second ship.

Political restraints led to design restrictions, including the absence of helicopter hangars, a displacement limit of 8,300 tons, and a 50-foot shorter hull than the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;&#x27;s. The designers were forced to make compromises, such as a wide flaring bow. To compensate for the limited length, the originally-planned 80,000 shaft horsepower (shp) LM2500 gas turbines were upgraded to 100,000 shp. No main gun was included in the original design, later amended to include an OTO Melara 76 mm, before finally selecting the 5-inch/54-caliber Mark 45. Despite their constraints, the designers benefitted from insight gained from previous classes; for example, they chose an all-steel superstructure to improve survivability.

The total cost of the first ship was $1.1 billion, the other $778 million being for the ship&#x27;s weapons systems. USS &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works at Bath, Maine, on 6 December 1988, and launched on 16 September 1989 by Mrs. Arleigh Burke. The Admiral himself was present at her commissioning ceremony on 4 July 1991, held on the waterfront in downtown Norfolk, Virginia. Orders for Flight I ships continued through 1995.

=== Flight II ===
The Flight II iteration of the class was introduced in FY1992. The incorporation of the AN/SRS-1A(V) Combat Direction Finding enhanced detection of signals. The TADIX-B, JTIDS Command and Control Processor, and Link 16 improved communication with other assets. The SLQ-32 EW suite was upgraded to (V)3, and the SPS-67(V)3 surface search radar was upgraded to (V)5. Flight II also gained the capability to launch and control the SM-2ER Block IV. An expansion of fuel capacity slightly increased the displacement.

=== Flight IIA ===
The Flight IIA design was first procured in FY1994. Among the additions are two hangars and support facilities for ASW helicopters, Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), the Kingfisher mine detection system, and five blast-resistant bulkheads. To accommodate the hangars, the length was increased to , and the rear-facing SPY-1D arrays are mounted one deck (eight feet) higher to prevent a blind spot. Flight IIA replaced retractable missile loading cranes on the forward and aft VLS with a total of six additional cells. The propellers are of a different design to reduce cavitation. New fiber optics improved bandwidth and helped reduce weight gain. Systems removed from Flight IIA include the Harpoon missile launchers and, starting with , the forward Phalanx CIWS. Flight IIA ships were initially built without the AN/SQR-19 TACTAS, though later units were subsequently installed with TACTAS.

Starting with , the longer 5-inch/62-caliber (127 mm) Mark 45 Mod 4 gun was installed. Later Flight IIA ships starting with use the BridgeMaster E as their navigation radar instead of the AN/SPS-73(V)12. Subsequent Flight IIA ships employ additional signature-reduction measures: the hangars of DDG 86 onwards are made of composite materials, and the exhaust funnels of DDG 89 onwards are shrouded by the superstructure. The use of the improved SPY-1D(V) radar, starting with , enhances the ships&#x27; ability to filter out clutter and resist electronic attack.

Several Flight IIA ships were constructed without any Phalanx CIWS because of the planned Evolved SeaSparrow Missile; the Navy had initially decided that ESSM made Phalanx redundant. However, the Navy later changed its mind and decided to retrofit all IIA ships to carry at least one Phalanx CIWS by 2013.

DDGs 91–96 (USS &quot;Pinckney&quot;, , , , , and ) were built with superstructure differences to accommodate the AN/WLD-1 Remote Minehunting System (RMS). However, only &quot;Pinckney&quot;, &quot;Momsen&quot;, and &quot;Bainbridge&quot; were installed with the system before the RMS program was canceled.

===Modernization===
Efforts to modernize the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class began amid congressional concerns over the retirement of the . In 1996, the Navy began a program to field the Extended Range Guided Munition (ERGM) for the DDG 51 class. The ERGM was to extend the class&#x27;s 5-inch Mark 45 gun range to . It necessitated a modification of the gun; the 62-caliber Mark 45 Mod 4 was created and installed on DDG 81 and onwards in anticipation of the ERGM. However, the ERGM was canceled in 2008.

The current DDG 51 modernization program is designed to provide mid-life upgrades to ensure the destroyers remain effective with service lives of at least 35 years. Modernization of existing ships provides commonality with in-production ships. The program&#x27;s goals are reduced manning, increased mission effectiveness, and reduced total cost. Mid-life modernization of Flight I and II ships is done in two phases: the first phase updates the hull, mechanical, and electrical (HM&amp;E) systems, while the second phase focuses on Aegis Combat System upgrades and introduces an Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE). By 2017, modernization technologies were introduced to production ships, and the Navy started modernization of Flight IIA ships through a single process combining both phases of upgrading. The capabilities of modernized destroyers include CEC, Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), ESSM support, improved electronic support with Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block 2, improved data processing with Boeing&#x27;s Gigabit Ethernet Data Multiplex System, and improvements to littoral warfare.

In July 2010, BAE Systems announced it had been awarded a contract to modernize 11 ships. In May 2014, USNI News reported that 21 of the 28 Flight I and II &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers would not receive the full mid-life upgrade that included electronics and Aegis Baseline 9 software for SM-6 compatibility; instead, they would retain the basic BMD 3.6.1 software in a $170 million upgrade concentrating on HM&amp;E systems, and on some ships, their anti-submarine suite. Seven Flight I ships—DDGs 51–53, 57, 61, 65, 69—received the full $270 million Baseline 9 upgrade. Deputy of surface warfare Dave McFarland said that this change was due to the budget cuts in the Budget Control Act of 2011.

In 2016, the Navy announced it would begin outfitting 34 Flight IIA &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;s with a hybrid-electric drive (HED) to lower fuel costs. The four LM2500 gas turbines of the class are most efficient at high speeds; an electric motor was to be attached to the main reduction gear to turn the drive shaft and propel the ship at speeds under , such as during BMD or maritime security operations. Use of the HED for half the time could extend time on station by 2.5 days before refueling. In March 2018, the Navy announced the HED would be installed on to test the technology, but upgrades of further destroyers would be halted due to changed budget priorities.

Also in 2016, four destroyers of the U.S. 6th Fleet based in Naval Station Rota, Spain (USS &quot;Carney&quot;, USS &quot;Ross&quot;, USS &quot;Donald Cook&quot;, and USS &quot;Porter&quot;) received self-protection upgrades, replacing one of their two Phalanx CIWS with a SeaRAM CIWS, which combines the Phalanx sensor dome with an 11-cell RIM-116 launcher. This was the first time the system was paired with an Aegis ship. Another four ships (USS &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;, USS &quot;Roosevelt&quot;, USS &quot;Bulkeley&quot;, and USS &quot;Paul Ignatius&quot;) have since been forward-deployed to Rota and also received a SeaRAM.

In February 2018, Lockheed Martin received a contract to deliver its High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance (HELIOS) system for installation onto an &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; destroyer. HELIOS is a &quot;60+ kW&quot;-class laser, scalable to 120 kW, that can &quot;dazzle&quot; or destroy small boats and UAVs up to away. It would be the first laser weapon put on a warship. In November 2019, had the Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN) system installed. ODIN differs from the XN-1 LaWS previously mounted on in that ODIN functions as a dazzler, which blinds or destroys optical sensors on drones rather than shooting down the aircraft. HELIOS was delivered to the Navy in August 2022 and installed on . &quot;Preble&quot; was expected to begin at-sea testing of the HELIOS in FY2023.

Also by 2018, all &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class ships homeported in the Western Pacific were scheduled to have upgraded ASW systems, including the TB-37U MFTA replacing the AN/SQR-19 TACTAS.

In FY2019, the Navy started a program to procure the Mod 4 variant of the Mark 38 machine gun system to address &quot;unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and high speed maneuverable unmanned surface vehicle (USV) threats.&quot; Mod 4 will incorporate the 30 mm Mk44 Bushmaster II instead of the 25 mm M242 Bushmaster of previous variants. The Mk 38 Mod 4 is planned to be fielded on Flight IIA and III &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers.

In October 2020, National Security Advisor Robert C. O&#x27;Brien said that all three Flights of the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer would field the Common-Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) missile developed under the Conventional Prompt Strike program. However, the C-HGB is expected to be around wide, making it too large to fit in Mk 41 VLS tubes or on deck launchers. Installing them on &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; destroyers would require removing some Mk 41 cells to accommodate the larger weapon, an expensive and time-consuming process. There is criticism of this idea: the oldest Flight I ships would need a service life extension to justify refit costs that would only prolong their service lives a short time when they are already more expensive to operate, and the newest Flight III ships that are optimized for BMD would be given a new, complex mission requiring a major refit shortly after introduction.

About 20 Flight IIA destroyers will undergo further modernization under the DDG MOD 2.0 program. DDG MOD 2.0 will backfit SPY-6(V)4 and Aegis Baseline 10 to provide similar capabilities to Flight III ships, as well as upgrade cooling systems to support the new radar. DDG MOD 2.0 will also deliver the AN/SLQ-32(V)7 EW suite, which adds the SEWIP Block 3 electronic attack subsystem. In May 2021, the Navy approved a &quot;Smart Start Plan&quot; for four ships—DDGs 91, 93, 95, 97—to make a gradual transition to DDG MOD 2.0. These ships will undergo a DDG MOD 1.5 phase that provides the SLQ-32(V)7; in 2023, DDG 91 became the first destroyer to receive SLQ-32(V)7. They will then receive the SPY-6(V)4, Aegis Baseline 10, and cooling system upgrades during a later depot modernization period.

Starting in 2025, the Navy will replace Phalanx CIWS on the destroyers with RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launchers to improve their point defense capability. &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;s with the latest Aegis baselines will receive the 21-cell Mk 49 RAM launcher; &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;s with older Aegis software will receive the 11-cell SeaRAM. It is unclear if ships with two Phalanx CIWS or ships already in a Phalanx-SeaRAM configuration will retain one Phalanx.

=== Production restarted ===
 was originally intended to be the last of the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class. The Navy planned to shift production to the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer focusing on NGFS and littoral operations. However, at a July 2008 hearing, Navy officials announced intentions to restart &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; production in place of additional &quot;Zumwalt&quot;s, testifying to the latter&#x27;s inability to counter emerging ballistic missiles, anti-ship missiles, and blue-water submarines. &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers have been in production for longer than any other surface combatant class in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s history.

In April 2009, the Navy announced a plan limiting the &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class to three units while ordering another three &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class ships from both Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipbuilding. In December 2009, Northrop Grumman received a $170.7 million letter contract for long lead-time materials. Shipbuilding contracts for DDG 113 to DDG 115 were awarded in mid-2011 for $679.6 million–$783.6 million; these do not include government-furnished equipment such as weapons and sensors, which took the average cost of the FY2011/12 ships to about $1.843 billion per vessel.

DDG 113 through 115 are &quot;restart&quot; ships, similar to previous Flight IIA ships, but including modernization features such as OACE and the TB-37U MFTA, which are being backfit onto previous ships.

The U.S. Navy was considering extending the acquisition of &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers into the 2040s, according to revised procurement tables sent to Congress, with the procurement of Flight IV ships from 2032 through 2041. This was canceled to cover the cost of the s, with the air defense commander role retained on one cruiser per carrier strike group.

In April 2022, the Navy proposed a procurement plan for nine ships, with an option for a tenth, to build two ships a year from 2023 to 2027. Some lawmakers pushed to add a third ship to be built in 2023, bringing the total of the proposed deal to eleven ships. This would follow the Navy&#x27;s two-ship per year procurement from 2018 to 2022.

===Flight IIA Technology Insertion===
DDG-116 to DDG-124 and DDG-127 will be &quot;Technology Insertion&quot; ships with elements of Flight III. For example, and onwards have the AN/SPQ-9B, a feature of Flight III, instead of the AN/SPS-67. Flight III proper began with the third ship procured in 2016, (DDG-125).

=== Flight III ===
In place of the canceled CG(X) program, the U.S. Navy began detailed design work on a DDG 51 Flight III design in FY2013. The Navy planned to procure 24 Flight III ships from FY2016 to FY2031. In June 2013, it awarded $6.2 billion in destroyer contracts. Costs for the Flight III ships increased as requirements for the program grew, particularly related to the planned Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) needed for the IAMD role. An AMDR with a mid-diameter of had been proposed for CG(X), while the DDG 51 Flight III design could carry an AMDR with a mid-diameter of only . The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the design would be &quot;at best marginally effective&quot; because of the &quot;now-shrunken radar&quot;. The U.S. Navy disagreed with the GAO findings, stating that the DDG 51 hull was &quot;absolutely&quot; capable of fitting a large enough radar to meet requirements.

The Flight III&#x27;s AN/SPY-6 AMDR with a mid-diameter of uses an active electronically scanned array with digital beamforming, compared to the previous passive electronically scanned array AN/SPY-1D with a mid-diameter of . According to the SPY-6&#x27;s contractor Raytheon, the 37-RMA SPY-6(V)1 is 30 times more sensitive and capable of detecting objects &quot;half the size at twice the distance&quot; compared to the SPY-1D. The Flight III&#x27;s SPY-6 is integrated with Aegis Baseline 10. The new radar also requires more power; the three-megawatt, 450 V AG9140 generators were upgraded to four-megawatt, 4,160 V AG9160 generators. Additionally, the air conditioning plants were upgraded to increase the ships&#x27; cooling capacity. The area near where the two rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIBs) are stored was enclosed to accommodate additional crew, so the RHIBs are stacked. Other modifications include replacement of the Halon-based fire suppression system with a water mist system and strengthening of the hull to support the design&#x27;s additional weight.

14 Flight III ships have been ordered, and Flight III IOC is planned for 2024. The U.S. Navy may procure up to 42 Flight III ships for an overall total of 117 ships of the class.

==Replacement==

In April 2014, the U.S. Navy began the development of a new destroyer to replace the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class called the &quot;Future Surface Combatant&quot;. The new class is expected to enter service in the 2030s and initially serve alongside the Flight III &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;s. The destroyer class will incorporate emerging technologies like lasers, onboard power-generation systems, increased automation, and next-generation weapons, sensors, and electronics. They will use technologies from other platforms, such as the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer, littoral combat ships, and the .

The Future Surface Combatant may place importance on the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer&#x27;s electric drive system that provides propulsion while generating 58 megawatts of electrical power, levels required to operate future directed energy weapons. Initial requirements for the Future Surface Combatant emphasize lethality and survivability. The ships must also be modular to allow for inexpensive upgrades of weaponry, electronics, computing, and sensors over time as threats evolve. The Future Surface Combatant has evolved into the Large Surface Combatant, which became the DDG(X). The Navy plans to procure the first DDG(X) in FY2032.

==Operational history==
The class saw its first combat action through Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strikes against Iraq. Over 3 and 4 September 1996, and launched thirteen and eight TLAMs, respectively, as part of Operation Desert Strike. In December 1998, &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers again performed TLAM strikes as part of Operation Desert Fox. Eleven &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;s supported carrier strike groups engaged in Operation Iraqi Freedom, which included TLAM launches against ground targets during the operation&#x27;s opening stages in 2003.

In October 2011, the Navy announced that four &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers would be forward-deployed in Europe to support the NATO missile defense system. The ships, to be based at Naval Station Rota, Spain, were named in February 2012 as &quot;Ross&quot;, &quot;Donald Cook&quot;, &quot;Porter&quot;, and &quot;Carney&quot;. By reducing travel times to station, this forward deployment allows for six other destroyers to be shifted from the Atlantic in support of the Pivot to East Asia. Russia threatened to quit the New START treaty over this deployment, calling it a threat to their nuclear deterrent. In 2018, CNO Admiral John Richardson criticized the policy of keeping six highly mobile BMD platforms &quot;in a little tiny box, defending land&quot;, a role that he believed could be performed equally well at less cost by shore-based systems.

In October 2016, the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers &quot;Mason&quot; and &quot;Nitze&quot; were deployed to the coast of Yemen after a UAE auxiliary ship was struck in an attack for which Houthi rebels claimed responsibility. On 9 October, while in the Red Sea, &quot;Mason&quot; detected two anti-ship missiles headed toward herself and nearby USS &quot;Ponce&quot; fired from Houthi-controlled territory. &quot;Mason&quot; launched two SM-2s, one ESSM, and a Nulka decoy. One AShM was confirmed to have struck the water on its own, and it is unknown if the second missile was intercepted or hit the water on its own. On 12 October, in the Bab el-Mandeb strait, &quot;Mason&quot; again detected an inbound anti-ship missile, which was intercepted at a range of by an SM-2. On 13 October, &quot;Nitze&quot; conducted TLAM strikes destroying three Houthi radar sites used in the previous attacks. Back in the Red Sea, &quot;Mason&quot; experienced a third attack on 15 October with five AShMs. She fired SM-2s and decoys, destroying or neutralizing four missiles. &quot;Nitze&quot; neutralized the fifth missile with a radar decoy.

On 7 April 2017, the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers &quot;Ross&quot; and &quot;Porter&quot; conducted a TLAM strike against Shayrat Airfield, Syria, in response to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s chemical attack on his people three days prior. The ships fired a total of 59 Tomahawk missiles. On 14 April 2018, &quot;Laboon&quot; and &quot;Higgins&quot; conducted another TLAM strike against Syria. They fired seven and twenty-three TLAMs, respectively. The strike targeted chemical weapon sites as part of a continued effort against Assad&#x27;s use of chemical warfare. The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers &quot;Donald Cook&quot; and &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; took positions in the Mediterranean prior to the 2018 strike to mislead defending forces.

In October and November 2023, the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers &quot;Carney&quot; and &quot;Thomas Hudner&quot;, while deployed in the Red Sea, shot down numerous drones and missiles. On 19 October, &quot;Carney&quot; shot down at least three cruise missiles and eight drones that were potentially targeting Israel. On 15 and 22 November, &quot;Thomas Hudner&quot; shot down numerous drones launched by Houthi rebels from Yemen. On 27 November, &quot;Carney&quot; detected two ballistic missile launches from Houthi-controlled territory headed towards herself and nearby M/V &quot;Central Park&quot;; they splashed ten nautical miles away. On 29 November, &quot;Carney&quot; intercepted another Houthi missile. On 30 December, &quot;Gravely&quot; shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled territory at herself and nearby container ship &quot;Maersk Hangzhou&quot;. On 30 January 2024, a Houthi anti-ship cruise missile fired toward the Red Sea came within one mile of &quot;Gravely&quot;; she used her Phalanx CIWS to shoot down the missile.

During the Iranian strikes on Israel on 13 April 2024, USS &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; and USS &quot;Carney&quot; fired four to seven SM-3s, shooting down at least three Iranian ballistic missiles. This was the first time the SM-3 was employed in combat.

On 1 October 2024, USS &quot;Bulkeley&quot; and USS &quot;Cole&quot; fired 12 SM-3 and SM-6 missiles against Iranian ballistic missiles.

==Accidents and major incidents==
===USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing===

 was damaged on 12 October 2000 in Aden, Yemen, while docked by an attack in which a shaped charge of 200–300 kg in a boat was placed against the hull and detonated by suicide bombers, killing 17 crew members. The ship was repaired and returned to duty in 2001.

===USS &quot;Porter&quot; and MV &quot;Otowasan&quot; collision===
On 12 August 2012, USS &quot;Porter&quot; collided with the oil tanker MV &quot;Otowasan&quot; near the Strait of Hormuz; there were no injuries. The U.S. Navy removed &quot;Porter&quot;″s commanding officer from duty. Repairs took two months at a cost of $700,000.

===USS &quot;Fitzgerald&quot; and MV &quot;ACX Crystal&quot; collision===

On 17 June 2017, collided with the MV &quot;ACX Crystal&quot; cargo ship near Yokosuka, Japan. Seven sailors drowned. Following an investigation, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, executive officer, and Command Master Chief Petty Officer were relieved of their duties. In addition, close to a dozen sailors were given non-judicial punishment for losing situational awareness. Repairs were originally to be completed by the summer of 2019. However, initial repairs were made by February 2020. After the subsequent sea trials, she was brought in for additional repairs. The ship departed for her home port in June 2020.

===USS &quot;John S. McCain&quot; and &quot;Alnic MC&quot; collision===

On 21 August 2017, USS &quot;John S. McCain&quot; collided with the container ship &quot;Alnic MC&quot;. The collision injured 48 sailors and killed 10, whose bodies were all recovered by 27 August. The cause of the collision was determined to be poor communication between the two ships and the bridge crew lacking situational awareness. In the aftermath, the ship&#x27;s top leadership, including the commanding officer, executive officer, and Command Master Chief Petty Officer, were removed from command. In addition, top leadership of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, including the commander, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, were relieved of their duties due to a loss of confidence in their ability to command. Other commanders who were relieved included Rear Admiral Charles Williams, commander of Task Force 70, and Captain Jeffrey Bennett, commodore of Destroyer Squadron 15. This was the third incident involving a U.S. Navy ship in 2017, with a repair cost of over $100 million.

<doc id="197342" wikidata="Q250705" url="?curid=197342" title="Doomsday device">
<text>A doomsday device is a hypothetical construction – usually a weapon or weapons system – which could destroy all life on a planet, particularly Earth, or destroy the planet itself, bringing &quot;doomsday&quot;, a term used for the end of planet Earth. Most hypothetical constructions rely on hydrogen bombs being made arbitrarily large, assuming there are no concerns about delivering them to a target (see Teller–Ulam design) or that they can be &quot;salted&quot; with materials designed to create long-lasting and hazardous fallout (e.g., a cobalt bomb).

Doomsday devices and the nuclear holocaust they bring about have been present in literature and art especially in the 20th century, when advances in science and technology made world destruction (or at least the eradication of all human life) a credible scenario. Many classics in the genre of science fiction take up the theme in this respect. The term &quot;doomsday machine&quot; itself is attested from 1960, but the alliterative &quot;doomsday device&quot; has since become the more popular phrase.

==History==
Since the 1954 Castle Bravo thermonuclear weapon test demonstrated the feasibility of making arbitrarily large nuclear devices which could cover vast areas with radioactive fallout by rendering anything around them intensely radioactive, nuclear weapons theorists such as Leo Szilard conceived of a doomsday machine, a massive thermonuclear device surrounded by hundreds of tons of cobalt which, when detonated, would create massive amounts of Cobalt-60, rendering most of the Earth too radioactive to support life. RAND strategist Herman Kahn postulated that Soviet or US nuclear decision makers might choose to build a doomsday machine that would consist of a computer linked to a stockpile of hydrogen bombs, programmed to detonate them all and bathe the planet in nuclear fallout at the signal of an impending nuclear attack from another nation.

The US and its doomsday device&#x27;s theoretical ability to deter a nuclear attack is that it would go off automatically without human aid and despite human intervention. Kahn conceded that some planners might see &quot;doomsday machines&quot; as providing a highly credible threat that would dissuade attackers and avoid the dangerous game of brinkmanship caused by the massive retaliation concept which governed US-Soviet nuclear relations in the mid-1950s. However, in his discussion of doomsday machines, Kahn raises the problem of a nuclear-armed &quot;N&quot;th country triggering a doomsday machine, and states that he didn&#x27;t advocate that the US acquire a doomsday machine.

The Dead Hand (or &quot;Perimeter&quot;) system built by the Soviet Union during the Cold War has been called a &quot;doomsday machine&quot; due to its fail-deadly design and nuclear capabilities.

== In fiction ==
Doomsday devices started becoming more common in science fiction in the 1940s and 1950s, due to the invention of nuclear weapons and the constant fear of total destruction. A well-known example is in the film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964), where a doomsday device, based on Szilard and Kahn&#x27;s ideas, is triggered by an incompletely aborted American attack and all life on Earth is extinguished. Another is in the Star Trek episode &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; (1967), where the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; fights a powerful planet-killing alien machine. In Beneath the Planet of the Apes a cobalt device destroys life on earth. However, doomsday devices also expanded to encompass many other types of fictional technology, one of the most famous of which is the Death Star, a planet-destroying, moon-sized space station.

Some works have also considered the erroneous activation of doomsday devices by external factors or chain reactions. An example of both is &quot;Virus&quot; (1980), where an earthquake is misdetected as a nuclear explosion and triggers a sequence of &quot;Automated Reaction Systems (ARS)&quot;. Various types of fictional doomsday devices have also been activated as part of an AI takeover. This includes the missile launch system in the movie &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983), control of which has been handed entirely to a computer, and Skynet&#x27;s nigh-destruction of the human race in &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984).

<text>Sir Leslie Stephen (28 November 1832 – 22 February 1904) was an English author, critic, historian, biographer, mountaineer, and an Ethical movement activist. He was also the father of Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell.

==Life==
Sir Leslie Stephen came from a distinguished intellectual family, and was born at a house on Kensington Gore, later 42 Hyde Park Gate, in London, the son of Sir James Stephen and his wife, Jane Catherine ( Venn). His father was Colonial Undersecretary of State and a noted abolitionist. He was the fourth of five children, his siblings including James Fitzjames Stephen (1829–1894) and Caroline Emelia Stephen (1834–1909).

His family had belonged to the Clapham Sect, the early 19th-century group of mainly evangelical Christian social reformers. At his father&#x27;s house, he saw a good deal of the Macaulays, James Spedding, Sir Henry Taylor and Nassau Senior. Leslie Stephen was educated at Eton College, King&#x27;s College London and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. (20th wrangler) in 1854 and M.A. in 1857. He was elected a fellow of Trinity Hall in 1854 and became a junior tutor in 1856.

In 1859, he was ordained, but his study of philosophy, together with his perception of the religious controversies surrounding the publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859) by Charles Darwin, led to his losing his faith in 1862, and in 1864 he resigned from his positions at Cambridge, and moved to London. He recounted some of his experiences in a chapter in his &quot;Life of Fawcett&quot; as well as in some less formal &quot;Sketches from Cambridge: By a Don&quot; (1865). These sketches were reprinted from &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, to the proprietor of which, George Murray Smith, he had been introduced by his brother.

=== Marriage ===
====(1) Harriet (Minny) Thackeray 1867–1875====
The family connections included that of William Makepeace Thackeray. His brother, Fitzjames had been a friend of Thackeray&#x27;s and assisted in the disposition of his estate when he died in 1863. His sister Caroline met Thackeray&#x27;s daughters, Anny (1837–1919) and Minny (1840–1875) when they were mutual guests of Julia Margaret Cameron (of whom, see later). This led to an invitation to visit from Leslie Stephen&#x27;s mother, Lady Stephen, where the sisters met him. They also met at George Murray Smith&#x27;s house at Hampstead. Minny and Leslie became engaged on 4 December 1866 and married on 19 June 1867.

After the wedding, they travelled to the Swiss Alps and Northern Italy, and on return to England lived at the Thackeray sisters&#x27; home at 16 Onslow Gardens with Anny, who was a novelist. In the spring of 1868 Minny miscarried but recovered sufficiently for the couple to tour the eastern United States. Minny miscarried again in 1869, but became pregnant again in 1870 and on 7 December gave birth to their daughter, Laura Makepeace Stephen (1870–1945). Laura was premature, weighing three pounds. In March 1873, Thackeray and the Stephens moved to 8 Southwell Gardens. The couple travelled extensively, and by the summer of 1875, Minny was pregnant again, but this time in poor health. She went to the Alps and came back slightly better, but got back pains by OctoberNovember. On the evening of 27 November, she went to bed, fell into convulsions, and died the following day of eclampsia.

After Minny&#x27;s death, Leslie Stephen continued to live with Anny, but they moved to 11 Hyde Park Gate South in 1876, next door to her widowed friend and collaborator, Julia Duckworth. Leslie Stephen and his daughter were also cared for by his sister, the writer Caroline Emelia Stephen, although Leslie described her as &quot;Silly Milly&quot; and her books as &quot;little works&quot;. Meanwhile, Anny was falling in love with her younger cousin Richmond Ritchie, to Leslie Stephen&#x27;s consternation. Ritchie became a constant visitor and they became engaged in May 1877 and were married on 2 August. At the same time, Leslie Stephen was seeing more and more of Julia Duckworth.

====(2) Julia Duckworth 1878–1895====
His second marriage was to Julia Prinsep Duckworth (née Jackson, 1846–1895). Julia had been born in India and after returning to England she became a model for Pre-Raphaelite painters such as Edward Burne-Jones. In 1867, she had married Herbert Duckworth (1833 − 1870) by whom she had three children prior to his death in 1870.

Leslie Stephen and Julia Duckworth were married on 26 March 1878. They had four children:
* Vanessa (1879–1961), who married Clive Bell
* Thoby (1880–1906)
* Virginia (1882–1941), who married Leonard Woolf
* Adrian (1883–1948)

In May 1895, Julia died of influenza, leaving her husband with four young children aged 11 to 15 (her children by her first marriage being adults by then).

===Career===
In the 1850s, Stephen and his brother James were invited by Frederick Denison Maurice to lecture at The Working Men&#x27;s College. Leslie Stephen became a member of the college&#x27;s governing College Corporation.

Stephen was an honorary fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and received the honorary degree Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Cambridge and from the University of Oxford (November 1901).
While at Cambridge, Stephen became an Anglican clergyman. In 1865, having renounced his religious beliefs, and after a visit to the United States two years earlier, where he had formed lasting friendships with Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., James Russell Lowell and Charles Eliot Norton, he settled in London and became a journalist, eventually editing &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot; in 1871 where R. L. Stevenson, Thomas Hardy, W. E. Norris, Henry James, and James Payn figured among his contributors.

In his spare time, he participated in athletics and mountaineering. He also contributed to the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;Fraser&quot;, &quot;Macmillan&quot;, the &quot;Fortnightly&quot;, and other periodicals. He was already known as a climber, as a contributor to &quot;Peaks, Passes and Glaciers&quot; (1862), and as one of the earliest presidents of the Alpine Club, when, in 1871, in commemoration of his own first ascents in the Alps, he published &quot;The Playground of Europe&quot;, which immediately became a mountaineering classic, drawing—together with Whymper&#x27;s &quot;Scrambles Amongst the Alps&quot; — successive generations of its readers to the Alps.

During the eleven years of his editorship, in addition to three volumes of critical studies, he made two valuable contributions to philosophical history and theory. The first was &quot;The History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century&quot; (1876 and 1881). This work was generally recognised as an important addition to philosophical literature and led immediately to Stephen&#x27;s election at the Athenaeum Club in 1877. The second was &quot;The Science of Ethics&quot; (1882). It was extensively adopted as a textbook on the subject and made him the best-known proponent of evolutionary ethics in late-nineteenth-century Britain. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1901.

Leslie Stephen also served as the first editor (1885–91) of the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902.

=== Beliefs ===
As an adult, Stephen was an agnostic atheist who wrote extensively about his views. In &quot;Social Rights and Duties&quot; (1896), he explained how he came to lose his faith of his parents: &quot;When I ceased to accept the teaching of my youth, it was not so much a process of giving up beliefs as of discovering that I never really believed.&quot; His second wife, Julia, was similarly activist in her writings on agnosticism.

He advocated for more people of this view to claim the label &quot;agnostic&quot; for themselves, eschewing the harder associations of the unadorned term &quot;atheist&quot;, reflecting the fact that no one who claims disbelief in gods does so on the basis of professing absolute &quot;knowledge&quot; about the universe. He concluded his essay &quot;An Agnostic&#x27;s Apology&quot; with a reply to religious critics who hold atheists and agnostics in contempt:

Stephen was very involved in the organised Ethical movement. He served multiple terms as President of the West London Ethical Society (part of the Union of Ethical Societies). He gave numerous addresses and lectures to the ethical society during his tenure as president, which are collected at length across multiple volumes of writings. He was an active organiser in the movement, and in one lecture, entitled &quot;The aims of ethical societies&quot;, set about the task of defining the broader social purpose which animated the wider Ethical movement at that time.

=== Mountaineering ===

Stephen was one of the most prominent figures in the golden age of alpinism (the period between Wills&#x27;s ascent of the Wetterhorn in 1854 and Whymper&#x27;s ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865) during which many major alpine peaks saw their first ascents. Joining the Alpine Club in 1857 (the year of its formation), Stephen made the first ascent, usually in the company of his favourite Swiss guide Melchior Anderegg, of the following peaks:
* Wildstrubel – 11 September 1858 with T. W. Hinchliff and Melchior Anderegg
* Bietschhorn – 13 August 1859 with Anton Siegen, Johann Siegen and Joseph Ebener
* Rimpfischhorn – 9 September 1859 with Robert Living, Melchior Anderegg and Johann Zumtaugwald
* Alphubel – 9 August 1860 with T. W. Hinchliff, Melchior Anderegg and Peter Perren
* Blüemlisalphorn – 27 August 1860 with Robert Living, Melchior Anderegg, F. Ogi, P. Simond and J. K. Stone
* Schreckhorn – 16 August 1861 with Ulrich Kaufmann, Christian Michel and Peter Michel
* Jungfraujoch – July 1862 with H. B. George, Henry Morgan, F. J. Hardy, Living, and Moore.
* Monte Disgrazia – 23 August 1862 with E. S. Kennedy, Thomas Cox and Melchior Anderegg
* Zinalrothorn – 22 August 1864 with Florence Crauford Grove, Jakob Anderegg and Melchior Anderegg
* Mont Mallet – 4 September 1871 with G. Loppe, F. A. Wallroth, Melchior Anderegg, Ch. and A. Tournier

He was President of the Alpine Club from 1865 to 1868 and edited the &quot;Alpine Journal&quot;, 1868–1872.

== Death ==

He died in Kensington and is buried in the eastern section of Highgate Cemetery in the raised section alongside the northern path. His daughter, Virginia Woolf, was badly affected by his death and she was cared for by his sister, Caroline. Woolf in 1927 created a detailed psychological portrait of him in the fictional character of Mr. Ramsay in her classic novel,
&quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;, (as well as of her mother as Mrs. Ramsay). (Ref: The Diaries and Letters of Virginia Woolf) His probate is worded: STEPHEN sir Leslie of 22 Hyde Park-gate Middlesex K.C.B. probate London 23 March to George Herbert Duckworth and Gerald de L&#x27;Etang Duckworth esquires Effects £15715 6s. 6d.

To honour his memory, his friends held a lecture in 1907 at the University of Cambridge, which has been held bi-annually as the &quot;Leslie Stephen Lecture&quot; since. His friends endowed that it be held with the specification that it be on &quot;some literary subject, including therein criticism, biography and ethics.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Mustin&quot; (DD-413) was a &quot;Sims&quot;-class destroyer of the United States Navy, the first Navy ship of that name, in honor of Captain Henry C. Mustin (1874–1923), a pioneer of naval aviation.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Mustin&quot; was laid down on 20 December 1937 by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia; launched on 8 December 1938; sponsored by Mrs. Lloyd M. Mustin, daughter-in-law of Captain Mustin; and commissioned on 15 September 1939.

==Service history==

===Inter-War Period===
&quot;Mustin&quot; joined the Atlantic Fleet for the tense period of neutrality patrol preceding American entry in World War II, playing her part in guarding the western Atlantic. On 7 December 1941, she lay in overhaul at Boston Navy Yard, Massachusetts, but put to sea next day escorting and off to war. She herself completed overhaul in Charleston Navy Yard, South Carolina on 3 January 1942, transited the Panama Canal on 20 January, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 17 February for duty escorting convoys between Hawaii and San Francisco until 3 April.

===World War II===

====South Pacific, May 1942 – April 1943====
A convoy mission to Samoa was completed at Pearl Harbor on 24 May. &quot;Mustin&quot; next escorted a merchantman with reinforcements to Midway Island, threatened by the Japanese attack which exploded while &quot;Mustin&quot; was returning to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 5 June. Two days later, the destroyer sailed with Task Force 17 (TF 17), searching for scattered Japanese survivors of the great battle of Midway. After a negative search, the force returned to Hawaiian waters on 13 June, and &quot;Mustin&quot; began 2 months of training and patrols out of Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Mustin&quot; sailed on 17 August with TF 17, the group, bound for an important role in the great sea warfare which wrested the Southwest Pacific from the Japanese. Her group covered the southern approaches to Guadalcanal during the initial phase of fighting there, then struck Buin, Faisi, and Tonolai from the air. In the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October, &quot;Mustin&quot; rescued 337 of &quot;Hornet&quot;″s survivors, and had the grim duty of destroying the heavily damaged carrier with a full salvo of torpedoes. She avenged the carrier in part by shooting down five enemy aircraft during the battle.

Patrol and convoy duty from Nouméa and Espiritu Santo alternated with task force duty, and on 11 November, she joined TF 16 for the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. On 25 December, &quot;Mustin&quot; fired shore bombardment at enemy positions on Guadalcanal, to which she had just escorted transports. In February 1943, she again guarded carrier operations off Guadalcanal, then returned to patrol and escort duties until 14 April, when she returned to Pearl Harbor.

====North Pacific, April – August 1943====
Ten days later, &quot;Mustin&quot; reached Adak, Alaska, where she joined the patrol northwest of the island until the end of May, when her force sailed to cover the occupation of Attu Island. Through the summer, she patrolled the foggy, treacherous waters of the Aleutians, bombarding Kiska a number of times, and blocking Japanese reinforcement of that island. On the night of 25/26 July, her group was engaged in the freak &quot;Battle of the Pips&quot;, firing on what was actually a phantom Japanese force created only on radar by unusual atmospheric conditions. After covering the American recapture of Kiska on 15 August, &quot;Mustin&quot; headed for a Mare Island Naval Shipyard overhaul, from which she returned to Pearl Harbor on 31 October.

====Central Pacific, November 1943 – October 1944====
&quot;Mustin&quot; sortied with TF 52 on 10 November for the assault on Makin in the Gilberts 10 days later, then returned to the west coast for rehearsal amphibious operations off San Pedro, California. She arrived in Lahaina Roads, Maui on 21 January 1944 to stage for the Marshall Islands Campaign, and on the 30th bombarded enemy positions on Wotje. The next day, she screened cruisers pounding Kwajalein, and on 1 February joined in firing at the atoll. For the next 2 weeks, she escorted various task groups around Kwajalein, then operated off newly captured Eniwetok until returning to Pearl Harbor on 3 March.

&quot;Mustin&quot; next joined the support force of powerful TF 58, protecting vital fleet oilers as the carriers and planes they fueled struck Palau, Yap, Woleai, and Ulithi in the Carolines on 30 March – 1 April. She returned to the southwest Pacific on 7 April to screen carriers in amphibious assaults on New Guinea, at Aitape and Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) in April, and at Wakde in May. The continuing operations on and around New Guinea gave &quot;Mustin&quot; varied duty, on escort, patrol, bombardment, and as fighter-director, as one landing after another moved up the coast to wrest the huge island from the enemy. Noemfoor, Sansapor, Mios Woendi, Humboldt Bay, Biak were all struck by forces in which &quot;Mustin&quot; served.

====Philippines, October 1944 – February 1945====
On 15 September, &quot;Mustin&quot; served as primary fighter-director in the initial assault on Morotai, Netherlands East Indies, and after escorting reinforcements there from New Guinea, cleared Humboldt Bay on 16 October with reinforcements for newly invaded Leyte. Arriving on 25 October, &quot;Mustin&quot; departed the same day, escorting a convoy safely away from the Battle for Leyte Gulf. Escort operations among the bases of the western Pacific followed as &quot;Mustin&quot; gave distant support to the Philippines operation, before returning to Leyte Gulf on 25 November to join the local defense force under attack by enemy planes on 27 November. &quot;Mustin&quot; splashed three.

After rehearsals off New Guinea, &quot;Mustin&quot; sortied for the assault on Luzon on 9 January 1945, and for the next month fired in support of land forces, joined in repelling enemy air attack off Lingayen, and made antisubmarine patrols. She operated in the Philippines, aiding in movement of reinforcements until 2 February, when she sailed for Guadalcanal, off which she joined the 5th Fleet, serving as antisubmarine patrol ship while awaiting the beginning of the rehearsals for the Battle of Okinawa.

====Okinawa, March–May 1945====
Her task group staged at Ulithi, and arrived off Hagushi Beach, Okinawa on 1 April, screening the transport area as the initial assault was made. For the next 4 days, she guarded the transports off the beaches by day and during their night retirements, firing on the numerous &quot;kamikaze&quot; attackers. From 5 to 17 April, &quot;Mustin&quot; sailed to bring a convoy in from Saipan and Ulithi, then returned to fire support, radar picket, antisubmarine, and antiaircraft duty off Okinawa until 2 May, when she joined the screen of an escort carrier group operating to the southwest of Okinawa.

&quot;Mustin&quot; left Okinawa on 28 May for Guam, Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and San Pedro, arriving on 18 June for a yard overhaul and alterations. The war ended 6 days before she left San Pedro. After refresher training, &quot;Mustin&quot; sailed for occupation duty in Japan, arriving Ominato, Honshū on 16 September.

===Post-War===

====Operation Crossroads====
Late in the year she returned to the west coast and sailed back to Hawaii to prepare for Operation Crossroads, the atomic tests at Bikini Atoll, in which she was engaged through the summer of 1946. She decommissioned on 29 August 1946 after use as a target; remained at Bikini; and was destroyed by gunfire on 18 April 1948 in the Marshall Islands.

==Awards==
&quot;Mustin&quot; received 13 battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="197348" wikidata="Q1782437" url="?curid=197348" title="USS Mustin (DDG-89)">
<text>USS &quot;Mustin&quot; (DDG-89) is the 39th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight IIA) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is named in honor of the Mustin family who have devoted over a century to US Naval service. &quot;Mustin&quot; was the 18th ship of this class to be built at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and construction began on 15 January 2001. She was launched on 12 December 2001 and was christened on 15 December 2001. On 26 July 2003, a twilight commissioning ceremony was held at the Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California.

==Namesakes==
Often referred to as &quot;The Father of Naval Aviation&quot;, Captain Henry C. Mustin (1874–1923), a graduate of the US Naval Academy (class of 1896), was the principal architect for the concept of the catapult launch. He married Corinne DeForest Montague, great-granddaughter of Commodore Arthur Sinclair, and a first cousin and close confidante of Wallis Simpson. Simpson gained notoriety for her controversial relationship with King Edward VIII of Great Britain who abdicated his crown to marry her in 1936. The Mustins had three children: Lloyd M., Henry A. and Gordon S.

As a Lieutenant Commander in January 1914, Mustin established Naval Aeronautic Station Pensacola, the Navy&#x27;s first permanent air station together with a flight school, and became its first Commanding Officer. The first flight was made from the station on 2 February by Lieutenant J. H. Towers and Ensign G. de Chevalier. On 5 November 1915, while underway, Lieutenant Commander Mustin successfully flew an AB-2 flying boat off the stern of armored cruiser in Pensacola Bay, Florida, making the first ever recorded catapult launch from a ship underway. In 1899, he earned a commendation for distinguished service in the capture of Vigan, Philippines. The first operational missions of naval aircraft were flown under his command during the Veracruz operation in 1914 and he was the first to hold the title: Commander, Aircraft Squadrons, Pacific Fleet. Designated Naval Aviator Number Eleven, Captain Mustin was instrumental in the design of the Naval Aviator insignia.

His eldest son, Vice Admiral Lloyd M. Mustin (1911–1999), also a Naval Academy graduate (class of 1932), took part in developing the Navy&#x27;s first lead-computing anti-aircraft gun sight, which proved of major importance in the air-sea actions of World War II, and served on the cruiser during the naval battle of Guadalcanal. His ship was lost during that action, but he and other survivors landed on shore and he then served with a naval unit attached to the 1st Marine Division. His post-war service included commands at sea and development and evaluation of weapon systems. He later served as director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Vice Admiral Mustin&#x27;s two sons, Vice Admiral Henry C. Mustin and Lieutenant Commander Thomas M. Mustin continued their family&#x27;s tradition of military service. Vice Admiral Henry Mustin, another graduate of the Naval Academy (class of 1955), was a decorated Vietnam veteran who served in the 1980s as the Naval Inspector General, Commander, Second Fleet and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Policy. Lieutenant Commander Mustin, also a Naval Academy graduate (class of 1962) earned a Bronze Star during the Vietnam War for river patrol combat action.

Vice Admiral Henry Mustin&#x27;s son John Burton Mustin (born 1967), a Naval Academy graduate (class of 1990), is a United States Navy vice admiral who currently serves as Chief of Navy Reserve since 7 August 2020. He previously served as the Vice Commander of the Fleet Forces Command.

==Service history==
On 1 February 2005, &quot;Mustin&quot; began her maiden deployment and returned on 1 August.

In July 2006, &quot;Mustin&quot; and her crew of 300 were deployed to Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan, home of the Navy&#x27;s Seventh Fleet, for permanent assignment. Though this was during the same month as the North Korea missile tests, the deployment was unrelated.

During the 2008 Cyclone Nargis crisis in Myanmar and the subsequent Joint Task Force Caring Response aid mission, &quot;Mustin&quot;, then as part of the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), which including and , stood by off Burma from 13 May to 5 June, waiting for the Myanmar junta government to permit US aid to its citizens. However, in early June, with permission still not forthcoming, it was decided to return the ARG to its scheduled operations.

In March 2011, in company with aircraft carrier , &quot;Mustin&quot; was deployed off northeastern Honshu, Japan. The mission was to assist with relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

During the 2011 Thailand floods, &quot;Mustin&quot; was docked at Port Laem Chabang on a routine visit when the Thai government requested the warship to prolong her stay for up to six days to provide aerial surveillance of the flooding. In response, The Pentagon gave permission for the two Seahawk helicopters, from HSL-51 detachment Six, to provide the imaging.

On 28 May 2020, &quot;Mustin&quot; conducted a freedom of navigation operation past the Paracel Islands, which the Navy said it &quot;upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law by challenging the restrictions on innocent passage imposed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam and also by challenging China’s claim to straight baselines enclosing the Paracel Islands&quot;.

On 19 December 2020, &quot;Mustin&quot; transited the contested Taiwan Strait, which the US Navy said was &quot;in accordance with international law&quot; to &quot;demonstrate the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.&quot;

In Spring 2021, &quot;Mustin&quot; monitored Chinese aircraft carrier &quot;Liaoning&quot; after the latter sailed through the Miyako Strait, along with alleged Chinese militia boats amassed near Whitsun Reef in the Philippines. &quot;Liaoning&quot; entered the Philippine Sea immediately after the Whitsun Reef incident. On 4 April, &quot;Mustin&quot; approached &quot;Liaoning&quot;, maneuvred between her and her escorts, and photographed the commanding officer relaxing with his feet up, next to the executive officer with his arms crossed. &quot;Mustin&quot; was accused of &quot;cognitive warfare&quot; and was called &quot;very vile.&quot; A quote from one media outlet described the incident as such;
&quot;There are some photos that come to define the beginning of an era, and the &quot;Mustin&quot; photo has that feel. It perfectly encapsulates this moment in time as the US Navy, and the rest of the western world, looks on as China’s military continues its meteoric rise. &quot;Liaoning&quot;, China’s first carrier, is an excellent example of that.&quot;
Later, Vice Admiral Roy Kitchener claimed the photo was evidence that the carrier had &quot;operating restrictions&quot; with her escorts which allowed the US warship to get so close.

After completing a homeport shift from Yokosuka in July 2021, she is now part of Destroyer Squadron 1, based at San Diego, California.

<doc id="197352" wikidata="Q748902" url="?curid=197352" title="USS Carl Vinson">
<text>USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; (CVN-70) is the United States Navy&#x27;s third supercarrier. She is named for Carl Vinson (1883–1981), a congressman from Georgia, in recognition of his contributions to the U.S. Navy. The ship was launched during Vinson&#x27;s lifetime in 1980, undertook her maiden voyage in 1983, and underwent refueling and overhaul between 2005 and 2009.

Along with deployments in Operation Desert Strike, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Southern Watch, and Operation Enduring Freedom, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; has been involved in a number of notable events. The body of Osama bin Laden was buried at sea in 2011 from the deck of &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, and that same year, on Veterans Day, she played host to the first NCAA basketball game on an aircraft carrier, between North Carolina and Michigan State.

==Namesake==
A member of the United States House of Representatives for 50 years, Carl Vinson was, for 29 years, the Chairman of the House Naval Affairs and Armed Services Committee; Vinson was the principal sponsor of the so-called &quot;Vinson Acts&quot;, culminating in the Two-Ocean Navy Act of 1940, which provided for the massive naval shipbuilding effort in World War II.

===Ship seal===

The seal of USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; shows an eagle, wings spread and talons extended, carrying a banner in its beak. The eagle is emblematic of the nation and the ship&#x27;s motto, and also represents the power that resides in the ship&#x27;s aircraft. The eagle flies in the form of a stylized letter &quot;V,&quot; the initial of the ship&#x27;s namesake, Congressman Carl Vinson. The &quot;V&quot; also represents the ship&#x27;s hull when viewed bow-on. Inscribed on the banner that the eagle carries is the Latin phrase &quot;Vis Per Mare&quot; which means &quot;Strength through the Sea&quot;.

===Carrier Strike Group One===

In October 2009, the US Navy announced that &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; would be the flagship of the newly established Carrier Strike Group One (CSG1), based in San Diego. The ship, under the command of then Captain Bruce H. Lindsey, departed Norfolk for San Diego on 12 January 2010. Accompanying the carrier was Carrier Air Wing Seventeen, Destroyer Squadron 1 and the guided missile cruiser &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;.

==Design and construction==

The keel was laid at Newport News Shipbuilding on 11 October 1975, and on 15 March 1980 the ship was launched/christened. Congressman Carl Vinson became the first person in the history of the United States Navy to witness a ship&#x27;s launching in his honor. After builder sea trials, she was delivered to the Navy on 26 February 1982.

==Ship history==

===1980s===
USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; was commissioned on 13 March 1982 at Newport News, Virginia. Present were the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Thomas B. Hayward, Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, keynote speaker Senator John Tower, and ship&#x27;s sponsor Molly Snead, who was Vinson&#x27;s nurse for 34 years. After commissioning, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; put to sea to conduct flight deck certifications, an evaluation designed to test the ship&#x27;s ability to conduct modern US Navy carrier air operations. That was followed by numerous at sea periods for various training evolutions along the East Coast.

&quot;Carl Vinson&quot; departed Norfolk on 1 March 1983 with Carrier Air Wing 15 embarked for her maiden deployment, an eight-month, around-the-world cruise that had them operate in the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, South China Sea, and Pacific Ocean in a multitude of exercises and with port visits in Monte Carlo, Monaco, Casablanca, Morocco, Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Perth, Australia, Subic Bay, Philippines, Hong Kong, Sasebo, Japan, Pusan, Republic of Korea, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before arriving in her new homeport of Naval Air Station Alameda, California, arriving on 28 October 1983.

&quot;Carl Vinson&quot; participated in RIMPAC &#x27;84 before departing on 14 October 1984 for an overseas deployment in the Western Pacific. Carrier Air Wing 15 was embarked. From January until April 1985, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; was in the Indian Ocean for 107 consecutive days. The WESTPAC deployment included Sea of Japan operations while pursuing a Soviet Charlie I class submarine in the Indian Ocean.

The carrier received her first Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations conducted from November 1984 to May 1985. In February, the Chief of Naval Operations named &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; the winner of the Admiral James H. Flatley Memorial Award for operational readiness and aviation safety for 1984.

On 12 August 1986, the ship departed Alameda for a western Pacific deployment, again with CVW-15 aboard, and in the process became the first modern U.S. aircraft carrier to operate in the Bering Sea. In January 1987, after operating extensively in the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; transited the Bering Sea once more while returning to NAS Alameda.

&quot;Carl Vinson&quot; and CVW-15 departed for the ship&#x27;s fourth overseas deployment on 15 June 1988. While on station, the carrier supported Operation Earnest Will, the escort of U.S. flagged tankers in the Persian Gulf. The carrier returned to the States on 16 December 1988 and was awarded the Admiral Flatley Memorial Award for aviation safety for 1988.

On 18 September 1989, the carrier departed Alameda to participate in PACEX &#x27;89, the largest peacetime naval exercise since the Second World War. During the exercise &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; operated in the Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands, eventually leading a three-carrier battle group operation in the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean. &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; had a port call in Pusan, South Korea, and then returned to her home port of Alameda shortly after the devastating 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

===1990s===
&quot;Carl Vinson&quot; departed on her fifth deployment (again with CVW-15) on 1 February 1990, the last deployment for the A-7 Corsair. The ship returned to Alameda on 30 July 1990. On 22 September 1990, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; entered the yards at Bremerton Naval Station, Washington for a 28-month complex overhaul (COH). The carrier received her first COMNAVAIRPAC Battle &quot;E&quot; award for 1990.
On 17 February 1994, the carrier, with Carrier Air Wing Fourteen embarked, departed for the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch. The carrier returned to Alameda on 17 August 1994, receiving her third Admiral Flatley Award for aviation safety.

In 1995, a documentary entitled &quot;Carrier: Fortress at Sea&quot; was aired on the Discovery Channel, which chronicled the carrier&#x27;s six-month-long voyage to and from the Persian Gulf.

From 26 August until 3 September 1995, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; participated in Exercise Ke Koa, as well as ceremonies to commemorate the end of World War II in the Pacific. During these ceremonies, President Bill Clinton visited the ship in Hawaii. As part of the commemoration ceremonies, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; launched 11 World War II-era planes.

The ship departed for her seventh deployment 14 May 1996, heading for the Persian Gulf with CVW-14 in support for Operation Southern Watch and Operation Desert Strike. The ship also participated in Exercise Rugged Nautilus before returning to Alameda on 14 November 1996.

With the closing of Naval Air Station Alameda, the ship was transferred to Bremerton, Washington, arriving at her new homeport on 17 January 1997, where she played host to the last carrier launch and recovery operations for the A-6E Intruder.
In 1998 with Carrier Air Wing Eleven (CVW-11) embarked, the ship participated in RIMPAC &#x27;98. During the exercise on the morning of 10 August, the Australian diesel-electric submarine located the &#x27;enemy&#x27; carrier and &#x27;sank&#x27; her. &quot;Onslow&quot; closed to within without being detected, then released green flares to indicate her location, &#x27;sinking&#x27; the supercarrier. &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; then departed for the Persian Gulf, launching airstrikes on 19 December 1998 in support of Operation Desert Fox and Operation Southern Watch. These strikes continued into March 1999. In July 1999, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; was drydocked in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for 13 months as the Navy spent more than $230 million to upgrade the ship. Post refit shakedowns continued into 2000.

===2000s===
In February 2001, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; hosted actors Gene Hackman, David Keith, Owen Wilson, and others for filming of the carrier scenes for the movie &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; during intermediate pre-deployment underway workups. During this two-week period, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; crewmembers and CVW 11 crews took part in the filming along with the actors and film crews. Later, prior to commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, David Keith returned to &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; on station in the North Arabian Sea to present the first international viewing of &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; to the combined ship and air wing crew. Prior to deploying to the Persian Gulf, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; (CVN-70) was on a roughly four week carrier quals mission off the coast of Hawaii.

====September 11 attacks====
On 23 July 2001, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; steamed from Bremerton, Washington to San Diego, California, where CVW-11 airgroup once again embarked, then was bound for the Persian Gulf to support Operation Southern Watch. This changed abruptly on 11 September 2001, as the ship was rounding the tip of India. In response to the terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; changed course and sped toward the North Arabian Sea, where on 7 October 2001, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; launched the first airstrikes in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. For 72 days, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, along with Carrier Wing 11, launched over 4,000 combat sorties in the Global War on Terrorism, earning the ship the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; earned the Battle E and Navy Unit Commendation during this deployment. In mid December, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; began the return trip home, briefly stopping in Pearl Harbor Hawaii to commence a &quot;Tiger Cruise&quot; allowing crew member family members the opportunity to ride the ship to her homeport of Bremerton, Washington, arriving there on 23 January 2002. In April, the ship was overhauled, setting sail in September for a post-refit shakedown. During this time several new operational systems were installed, and the ship&#x27;s flight deck and catapults were completely renovated. Numerous other spaces and crew living areas were also entirely restored, drastically improving working and living conditions for the crew. Completing her maintenance and overhaul period in record-setting time, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; and crew got underway in September to conduct sea trials.

In January 2003 she was set for a one-month work up for Flight Deck Quals with Carrier Air Wing Nine (CVW-9) embarked. Due to the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom the ship was extended at sea indefinitely. From January 2003 until September 2003, she made port calls in Hawaii, Guam, South Korea, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. After nine months, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; finally returned to Bremerton on 15 September 2003. &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; participated in Foal Eagle, an annually scheduled joint and combined training exercise conducted in the Korean theatre.

==== Bawean Incident ====
On 3 July 2003, five F/A-18 Hornets from the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; were intercepted by F-16s from the Indonesian Air Force near Bawean Island over the Java Sea where they engaged in a dogfight and electronic warfare. &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; and her strike group were transiting through the Java Sea and had sought permission from Indonesia. However, Indonesia denied receiving any request for permission. Later, Indonesia filed a diplomatic complaint to the US for trespassing on its territory.

In competition year 2004, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award, awarded to the most battle-ready ship in the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

In January 2005, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; departed Bremerton, Washington with CVW-9 embarked for a Seven-month deployment, including several months in the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom &amp; Operation Enduring Freedom. Highlights of the cruise included port calls to Singapore, Guam, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Rhodes, Greece and Lisbon, Portugal. &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; ended this deployment at Naval Station Norfolk on 31 July 2005. During this deployment two Marine F-18 pilots were lost over Iraq.

====Refueling and Complex Overhaul 2005====

In November 2005, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; became the third carrier to undergo a mid-life Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), which was scheduled to last 36 months. The ship moved out of dry dock to a pier side berth at Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard in May 2007.

&quot;Carl Vinson&quot; commenced post-refueling sea trials on 28 June 2009 and returned to Naval Station Norfolk on 1 July 2009. The Navy accepted the carrier back into the fleet on 11 July 2009, after successful completion of her sea trials.

In October 2009, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; entered a four-month shipyard maintenance period at Northrop Grumman Newport News in preparation for her upcoming transit to the Pacific in the spring. The ship was scheduled to transit around South America to her new home at NAS North Island, San Diego, joining sister-carriers and , by early 2010.

===2010s===



On 12 January 2010, just hours after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; was ordered to redirect from her current deployment in the North Atlantic Ocean to Haiti to contribute to the relief effort as part of Operation Unified Response. Upon receiving orders from USSOUTHCOM, the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; battle group proceeded to Mayport, Florida where the ships loitered offshore to receive additional supplies and helicopters. The ships arrived off Port au Prince on 15 January 2010 to commence operations. CNN medical correspondent and neurosurgeon Sanjay Gupta, pediatric surgeon Henri Ford, and two Navy doctors removed a piece of concrete from the skull of a 12-year-old earthquake victim in an operation performed aboard &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; on 18 January. In addition to providing medical relief, the ship&#x27;s excess desalination capacity was critical to providing water to Haiti&#x27;s population during the earthquake relief.

In March 2010, during her transit around South America performed Gringo-Gaucho / Southern Seas 2010 maneuvers with the Argentine Navy.

On 12 April 2010, the carrier arrived at her new home port of Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego California.

On 30 November 2010, with Carrier Air Wing Seventeen embarked, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; departed Naval Air Station North Island for a three-week composite training unit exercise (COMPTUEX) and her 2010–2011 deployment to the U.S. Seventh Fleet Area of Responsibility (AOR) in the Western Pacific and U.S. Fifth Fleet Areas of Responsibility in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf as part of Carrier Strike Group One. This is the first Western Pacific deployment for &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; in more than five years since the ship entered her Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH) in late 2005.

On 11 April 2011 while operating in the Arabian Sea, an F/A-18 Hornet suffered an engine fire immediately after launch from the carrier. The aircraft returned to the carrier with one engine and the fire was extinguished without any damage to the ship or any injuries to the pilot or ship crew members.

On 2 May 2011, following the death of Osama bin Laden, his body was brought aboard &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, which was operating in the Northern Arabian Sea, and buried at sea following religious rites.

The ship docked in Manila Bay in the Philippines from 15 to 18 May 2011 for a &quot;routine port call and goodwill visit&quot; meant to &quot;highlight the strong historic, community, and military connections between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines.&quot; Among those given a special tour of this aircraft carrier were Philippine President Benigno Aquino III and U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Harry K. Thomas, Jr. This brief visit was criticized by cause-oriented group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan as well as Filipino youth leader Raymond Palatino and University of the Philippines political science professor Clarita Carlos.

The ship docked in Hong Kong in the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 22 May 2011 to take on supplies for her return to homeport San Diego, and to provide photo opportunities to the Chinese press. The ship returned to San Diego on 15 June 2011.

On 21 June 2011, it was announced that the Michigan State Spartans would play a regular season men&#x27;s basketball game against the North Carolina Tar Heels on the flight deck of &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; on Veterans Day. On 11 November 2011, the inaugural Carrier Classic took place at the Naval Air Station North Island on San Diego Bay in Coronado, California. U.S. President Barack Obama was one of 8,111 people in attendance as the Tar Heels defeated the Spartans by a score of 67–55.

On 30 November 2011, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; departed Naval Air Station North Island, California, on her scheduled Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment.

During January 2012, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; began her patrol of the Arabian Sea.

On 23 May 2012, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; returned to Naval Air Station North Island, California, to end her November 2011 deployment. The carrier had stopped earlier in Hawaii to pick up approximately 900 &quot;Tigers&quot; – friends and family of the sailors aboard the ship who traveled with the ship from Hawaii to San Diego.

On 5 July 2012, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; began preparations for a Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) period. PIA is a major maintenance phase that all American naval vessels must go through multiple times throughout their lifetime to be able to sustain underway operations. PIA 2012–2013 for &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; included overhauls of over 40 crew living spaces, 30 heads and hundreds of workspaces throughout the ship. Also included were upgrades to many of the electronics and defense systems that the ship uses during deployments, to include an upgrade from the Global Command and Control System-Maritime (GCCS-M) to the Distributed Common Ground System-Navy (DCGS-N).

On 30 January 2013, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; commenced sea trials, marking her first time underway in seven months, since the ammo offload which ended on 29 June 2012. Upon returning from this underway period, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, then Captain Kent D. Whalen, announced on 2 February 2013 that PIA had officially ended, marking the first on-time PIA completion since 1999. Since February 2013, the ship has been underway multiple times conducting carrier qualifications with Carrier Air Wing Seventeen as well as multiple crew certification exercises. The most recent accomplishment for &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; was the completion of her evaluation of nuclear reactor operation. During this evaluation, the Naval Sea Systems Command embarks a team of proctors who put the ship&#x27;s Reactor Department through a multitude of drills and exercises to test their ability to safely operate a nuclear reactor and to contain any casualty of the reactor as it occurs. This was completed on 1 July 2013.

On 22 August 2014, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; and assigned CVW-17 began a scheduled deployment to the U.S. 5th and 7th Fleet areas of responsibility. , Destroyer Squadron 1 and its ships , , and deployed with the carrier as part of the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; Carrier Strike Group (CSG). The carrier was deployed to the Persian Gulf to relieve USS &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot; in fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

On 11 September 2014 at 17:40 hrs local time, two F/A-18Cs from CVW-17 crashed in the western Pacific Ocean whilst operating from &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;. The carrier was in her area of operations in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. The planes were attached to Strike Squadron 94 and Strike Fighter Squadron 113 and collided from the carrier, an area approximately west of Wake Island. USS &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;, USS &quot;Gridley&quot;, USS &quot;Sterett&quot;, USS &quot;Dewey&quot;, and helicopters assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 15 (HSC 15) and Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 73 (HSM 73) assisted in the search for the pilots. Whilst one pilot was recovered alive soon after the crash, the second pilot could not be located. The Navy continued its search for the second pilot until 13 September 2014, when the search was abandoned.

&quot;Carl Vinson&quot; returned to San Diego on 4 June 2015. Over the course of the deployment, supporting strike operations in Iraq and Syria, CVW-17 successfully flew 12,300 sorties, including 2,382 combat missions and dropped more than half a million pounds (230 tons) of ordnance against ISIS.

On 14 August 2015, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; began a planned incremental availability (PIA) period at Naval Air Station North Island. The ship received more than $300 million worth of improvements over six months during this modernisation, including the first UAV command center installed aboard an aircraft carrier.

In 2016, Carrier Air Wing Two was reassigned to &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;. The carrier began her next scheduled deployment to the Western Pacific with CVW-2 on 5 January 2017.

In mid February 2017, it was reported that the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; CSG commenced &quot;routine operations&quot; in the South China Sea. During the first half of April 2017, after conducting training exercises with the Republic of Korea Navy in the Western Pacific, the CSG was reportedly ordered towards the Korean Peninsula amid growing concerns about North Korea&#x27;s ballistic missile program. &quot;We are sending an armada,&quot; President Donald Trump announced on 12 April 2017, sending a signal to deter North Korea after missile and nuclear provocations.However, the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; and her escorts were away, undertaking joint exercises with the Royal Australian Navy in the Indian Ocean south of Singapore. Confusion appeared to stem from a &quot;glitch-ridden sequence of events&quot; that included a premature announcement of the deployment from the Navy.

On 5 January 2018, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; left San Diego for her next scheduled deployment to the Western Pacific. On 5 March 2018, the ship entered Da Nang Port, alongside and , on a scheduled visit to Vietnam. This visit was planned from when President Donald Trump was on a State visit to Vietnam. U.S. Navy sailors on the ships engaged in cultural activities and training with the Vietnamese Navy. This visit was hoped to &quot;increase the relations between the two countries.&quot; &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; returned to San Diego on 12 April 2018. In July 2018, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; participated in exercise RIMPAC 2018.

On 2 August 2018, it was announced that &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; will move from San Diego to Naval Base Kitsap to go through a period of maintenance at Puget Sound and will replace &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; at San Diego.

===2020s===
On 8 January 2020, it was announced that &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; will be changing home port back to San Diego bringing the number of San Diego–based carriers from two to three, joining and .

The COVID-19 pandemic was reported to have spread to the crew of &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; when its first case was reported on 23 March 2020. At the time, the ship was in dry dock for maintenance at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and it was reported that &quot;the sailor did not board the vessel and had no contact with any shipyard personnel.&quot;

On 2 September 2020, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; arrived in her new homeport of San Diego following a 17-month overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; left San Diego for her next deployment on 3 August 2021, with CVW-2 embarked. One of the squadrons assigned to CVW-2 was Strike Fighter Squadron 147 (VFA-147). This was the first operational deployment of a U.S. Navy squadron equipped with the F-35C Lightning II.

On 24 January 2022, while &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; was operating in the South China Sea, an F-35C with VFA-147 crashed while landing, resulting in injuries to at least seven crew members. The pilot safely ejected and was recovered from the water shortly after. The pilot and two of the injured deck crew were taken to a hospital in Manila, Philippines for treatment, while the remaining injured were treated in the carrier&#x27;s medical facilities. The wreck of the F-35C was lost over the edge into the sea after the incident. 37 days after the incident, the plane was recovered.

Carl Vinson participated in the RIMPAC 2024 exercise. On December 29 2024, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; made a port visit to Port Klang, Malaysia.

<doc id="197353" wikidata="Q4499115" url="?curid=197353" title="Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles">
<text>Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles, (31 October 1598 – 17 February 1680) was an English statesman, best remembered as one of the Five Members whose attempted arrest by Charles I in January 1642 sparked the First English Civil War.

When fighting began in August, Holles raised a Parliamentarian regiment which fought at Edgehill before it was nearly destroyed at Brentford in November 1642. This marked the end of Holles&#x27; military career and he became leader of the Parliamentarian &#x27;Peace Party&#x27;, those who favoured a negotiated settlement with the king. A social conservative from a wealthy family, he came to see political radicals like the Levellers and religious Independents like Oliver Cromwell as more dangerous than the Royalists.

Following victory in the First English Civil War, he led those who opposed Cromwell and his supporters, and was one of the Eleven Members suspended in June 1647. Recalled prior to the Second English Civil War in June 1648, he was excluded again by Pride&#x27;s Purge in December and went into exile before being allowed home in 1654. After The Restoration of 1660, Charles II made him Baron Holles and Ambassador to France from 1663 to 1666, an appointment that proved unsuccessful.

Holles gradually became part of the Whig opposition, backing the 1673 Test Act and exclusion in 1679 of the Catholic heir, James, Duke of York. He died in February 1680 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. One biographer summarised his career by saying; &quot;...successful in almost everything he privately undertook, (he was) unsuccessful in almost everything he publicly undertook, (while) his passionate parliamentarianism was constantly counter-productive&quot;.

==Personal details==

Born on 31 October 1598, Denzil Holles was the second surviving son of John Holles, 1st Earl of Clare (c. 1564–1637) and his wife Anne Stanhope (1576–1651). He had four siblings who lived into adulthood; Arabella (1594–1631), who married Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, John Holles, 2nd Earl of Clare (1595–1666), Francis (1604–1622) and Eleanore (died 1681).

In 1626, Holles married Dorothy Ashley; before her death in 1640, they had four children, of whom only Francis (1627–1690) survived into adulthood. He remarried Jane Shirley in 1642, then six months after her death in March 1666, he married for a third time, to Esther le Lou; both marriages were childless.

==Career; prior to 1640==
John Holles was a wealthy landowner with substantial estates in Nottinghamshire and Cornwall; in 1616, he purchased a barony for the then enormous sum of £10,000 and an earldom for £5,000 in 1624. Despite this expenditure, his political career was largely unfulfilled and Denzil Holles has been described as &quot;the angry younger son of a bitter and disappointed father&quot;.

From 1611 to 1615, Holles was educated at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he apparently became friendly with the future Charles I, followed by legal training at Gray&#x27;s Inn. He spent 1618 and 1619 travelling in Europe and in 1624 was elected MP for Mitchell, close to the family&#x27;s Cornish estates. He made little impact on this Parliament, which was dissolved when James I died in March 1625.

Holles was a Presbyterian and like many Puritans strongly objected to the pro-Spanish policy pursued by Charles I and his favourite, Buckingham; his elder brother John was the son-in-law of English Protestant mercenary Horace Vere, and served with him in the Eighty Years War, as did his younger brother Francis. After the disastrous Isle of Ré expedition in 1627, Holles wrote to Thomas Wentworth that &quot;since England was England, it received not so dishonourable a blow&quot;.

In 1628, he was elected for Dorchester, where his father-in-law had significant influence. He played a prominent role in organising support for the Petition of Right and on 2 March 1629 was one of those who famously forced the Speaker to continue sitting, thus preventing Charles dissolving Parliament. A week later Charles dissolved Parliament, ushering in eleven years of Personal Rule, in which he attempted to regain all the ground lost. Holles, Sir John Eliot and seven others were prosecuted by the Star Chamber and fined; released on bail in October, Holles spent most of the next decade in obscurity.

==Career; 1640 to 1642 ==
Defeat in the 1639 and 1640 Bishops&#x27; Wars forced Charles to recall Parliament and Holles was elected for Dorchester in both the Short and Long Parliaments. Shortly after the House of Commons assembled, it was presented with the Root and Branch petition, signed by 15,000 Londoners; they demanded the expulsion of bishops and an end to &quot;Catholic practices&quot; in the Church of England.

Many viewed these as signs Charles was about to sign an alliance with Catholic Spain, including the French and Venetian ambassadors; this made ending his control over policy vital not just for England but the European Protestant cause in general.

Since respect for the institution of monarchy prevented direct attacks on Charles, the alternative was to prosecute his &#x27;evil counsellors&#x27;; in December, Parliament began the impeachment of Laud and Strafford, Holles&#x27; former brother-in-law. Although Holles viewed Archbishop Laud with hostility, his relationship with Strafford meant he was not involved in his prosecution and tried to prevent his execution in May 1641. Instead he played a prominent part in negotiations with the Scots Covenanters that led to the Treaty of London in August.

The Commons enacted constitutional reforms including the Triennial Acts and the abolition of the Star Chamber, which the bishops ensured were rejected by the House of Lords; when the Commons responded with the Bishops Exclusion Bill, they blocked that too.

Unlike his colleagues, Holles opposed bishops, not for religious reasons but because he objected to their role in the Lords; as they were also responsible for censorship, their removal led to an explosion in the printing of pamphlets, books and sermons, often advocating radical religious and political principles. Many Presbyterians were social conservatives and in June 1641 Holles demanded restrictions to prevent &quot;this great disorder before it came to a higher pitch and degree&quot;.

The outbreak of the Irish Rebellion in October brought matters to a head since although both Charles and Parliament supported raising troops to suppress it, neither trusted the other with their control. Holles helped John Pym draft the Grand Remonstrance, presented to Charles on 1 December 1641; this led to the creation of a separate Royalist party, headed by those like Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon who felt Parliament was now seeking too much power. Unrest culminated on 23 to 29 December with widespread riots led by the London apprentices and as a result, bishops stopped attending the Parliament.

On 30 December, John Williams, Archbishop of York, and eleven other bishops, signed a complaint, disputing the legality of any laws passed by the Lords during their exclusion. Led by Holles, the Commons argued they were inviting the king to dissolve Parliament and thus committing treason; all twelve were arrested.

On 4 January 1642, Charles tried to arrest the Five Members, including Holles, but failed and left London, accompanied by Royalist MPs like Clarendon and members of the Lords; this proved a major tactical mistake, as it gave Pym majorities in both houses.

With both sides preparing for hostilities, Holles was appointed to the Committee of Safety on 4 July 1642, and helped organise the Dorset militia before returning to London to raise a regiment of infantry. In August, he marched to join the main Parliamentarian army assembling at Northampton and on 23 August took part in one of the first skirmishes of the war at Southam, before joining an unsuccessful attack on Sherborne Castle in early September. At Edgehill in October, his regiment helped prevent a Parliamentarian rout, before being largely destroyed just outside London at Brentford on 9 November.

==Career; 1643 to 1659 ==
Like many others, Holles had been reluctant to go to war, which divided his family; his cousin Gervase Holles served in the Royalist army, while another relative, William Holles, was killed outside Oxford in March 1644. Although not present at Brentford, contemporaries suggested the casualties suffered by his regiment were one reason Holles became a leading member of the Parliamentarian &#x27;Peace Party&#x27;. This caused a breach with Pym, who believed Charles had to be defeated militarily since he would never voluntarily keep commitments he considered forced on him.

In May 1643, a plot was uncovered organised by Edmund Waller, a leading moderate and cousin of John Hampden and William Waller, commander of the Western Association Army. The conspirators intended to take control of London, arrest Pym and other leaders of the &#x27;War Party&#x27;, and then negotiate with the king. Although probably aware of the plan, Holles avoided arrest, but the revelation hardened opinion within Parliament against a peace settlement. At the same time, Royalist victories in 1643 made Charles unwilling to negotiate until the war turned against him in late 1644; Holles represented Parliament from November 1644 to January 1645 Uxbridge negotiations, but these made little progress.

The New Model Army formed in April 1645 played a crucial role in defeating Charles, who surrendered in May 1646 to the Scots army outside Newark. However, it was dominated by religious Independents like Oliver Cromwell whom Holles violently opposed, while many members belonged to radical political groups such as the Levellers. As a result, Presbyterians in both England and Scotland viewed the New Model as more dangerous than the Royalists.

The Committee for Both Kingdoms which had directed the war was dissolved in January 1647 and replaced by the Derby House Committee, dominated by Holles and his allies. In return for £400,000, the Scots handed Charles over to Parliament in February, and he was held at Holdenby House, guarded by troops under Colonel Edward Rossiter, a Presbyterian MP who later married Holles&#x27; niece Arabella. By March 1647, the New Model was owed more than £3 million in wages and Parliament ordered it to Ireland, stating only those who agreed to go would be paid. When their representatives demanded full payment for all in advance, it was disbanded but the army refused to comply.

In early June, the Army Council removed Charles from Holdenby House and presented him with their terms for a political settlement, which he rejected. Backed by the Presbyterian-dominated London Militia, the moderate majority in Parliament now demanded he be invited to London for further discussions. Fearing he was going to be restored without significant concessions, soldiers commanded by Cromwell and Thomas Fairfax entered the city on 7 August and demanded the removal of those viewed as leaders of the opposition. Known as the Eleven Members, Holles was top of the list and although they were not formally expelled until 26 January, he immediately escaped to Normandy.

When the Second English Civil War began in April 1648, Parliament reseated the Eleven Members. Holles returned to London in August and although the Royalists were defeated again, he kept negotiating with Charles, who still resisted concessions. When agents intercepted communications from Charles to his supporters telling them to disregard any agreement he might make, the Army issued a &quot;Remonstrance&quot; claiming further talks were pointless. However, on 5 December Holles proposed continuing discussions, which Parliament passed by 129 votes to 83. This resulted in Pride&#x27;s Purge the next day, when MPs who had voted in favour were arrested by troops as they tried to enter the House; pre-warned, Holles once again escaped to Caen in France.

In exile, Holles refused an offer from Charles II to become his Secretary of State. He did not take part in the 1651 Third English Civil War, although some of his servants were allegedly involved in helping plan a rising in London to coincide with the Scottish invasion. In March 1654, he accepted Cromwell&#x27;s offer of amnesty for Presbyterian exiles and returned home to Dorset.

==Career; 1660 and after==

The death of Cromwell in September 1658 and the resignation of his son Richard in May 1659 paralysed the Commonwealth government and ended with The Restoration. In April 1660, Holles was elected for Dorchester to the Convention Parliament and formed part of the delegation sent to The Hague to formally invite Charles to return. One suggestion is this was partly to get him out of the way, due to disagreements within the Convention over the terms; Parliamentarian moderates like Holles wanted to restore the monarchy based on the 1648 Treaty of Newport, while Royalists demanded a return to the 1630s. In the end, most of the 1641 reforms were preserved, but bishops were restored to the Lords and the Church of England.

Charles appointed Holles to the Privy Council on 5 June and made him Custos Rotulorum of Dorset, while he was also one of the thirty-four commissioners appointed to try the regicides in September and October. Created Baron Holles of Ifield in April 1661, he became a member of the Lords, then Ambassador to France in July 1663; this was not a success, since his insistence on strict protocol infuriated the French and Charles resorted to communicating with Louis XIV of France through other parties.

He was recalled in January 1666 when France joined the Second Anglo-Dutch War as an ally of the Dutch Republic; on 14 November, the diarist Samuel Pepys recorded &quot;Sir George Carteret tells me...my Lord Holles had been with him and wept to think in what a condition we are fallen.&quot; In April 1667, he was part of the English delegation sent to negotiate the Treaty of Breda with the Dutch; talks dragged on until the humiliation of the Dutch Raid on the Medway in June led Clarendon to instruct him to agree to terms in order &quot;to calm people&#x27;s minds&quot; and &quot;free the king from a burden...he is finding hard to bear&quot;.

Despite having been against the war, Clarendon was sentenced to exile for its failure, an act Pepys described as &quot;mighty poor I think, and so doth everyone else&quot;. Holles argued against it and his house in Convent Garden became a meeting place for opposition leaders, including his long time associate Lord Shaftesbury. He urged the Lords to vote against the Conventicles Act 1670 and like many in Parliament viewed England&#x27;s alliance with France and involvement in the 1672 to 1674 Third Anglo-Dutch War as a betrayal of the Protestant cause.

In early 1673, English politics was further destabilised by the prospect of a Catholic monarch when Charles&#x27; heir and younger brother James, Duke of York publicly confirmed his conversion, and for the next 18 months, a small group of peers led by Holles and Shaftesbury attacked him in the Lords. This changed in 1675, when fearing Parliament was about to enact new measures against Catholics and English Dissenters, James proposed pardons for anyone convicted under the Conventicles Act. This initially won him backing from Holles, until Charles demanded he withdraw the idea.

Holles then joined Shaftesbury in opposing the 1675 Test Oath Act, which required members to swear an oath of non-resistance to the Crown. He did so on the grounds Charles had no right to require such measures since they were &#x27;contrary to law&#x27;, but his demands for restrictions on the monarchy were resented by the king. In &quot;The British Constitution Consider&#x27;d&quot;, published in 1676, Holles argued the prorogation of Parliament for more than a year was contrary to statute, and called for new Parliamentary elections to guarantee accountability. He claimed this would mitigate public concern over Charles&#x27; moves towards arbitrary government and French interference in English affairs driven by Louis XIV&#x27;s desire for &#x27;Universal monarchy&#x27;.

As a result, he was dismissed from the Privy Council, before being restored during the Popish Plot in 1679, when Charles sought to reach out to his opponents. During the Exclusion Crisis, a period of political turmoil triggered by attempts to exclude James from the succession, he backed Halifax, who was willing to allow him to succeed with strict limitations, rather than Shaftesbury, who wanted him removed entirely. However, by now he had largely lost his former influence, and in the opinion of one biographer had become &quot;a man out of his time.&quot; He died on 17 February 1680 and was buried at Westminster Abbey four days later.

==Publications==
In addition to &quot;Memoirs&quot;, which cover the period up until his first exile in 1647, he wrote a number of pamphlets. Published works include:

* &quot;The Case Stated concerning the Judicature of the House of Peers in the Point of Appeals&quot; (1675)

<text>The American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada (AFM/AFofM) is a 501(c)(5) labor union representing professional instrumental musicians in the United States and Canada. The AFM, which has its headquarters in New York City, is led by president Tino Gagliardi. Founded in Cincinnati in 1896 as the successor to the National League of Musicians, the AFM is the largest organization in the world to represent professional musicians. It negotiates fair agreements, protects ownership of recorded music, secures benefits such as healthcare and pension, and lobbies legislators. In the US, it is known as the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), and in Canada, it is known as the Canadian Federation of Musicians/Fédération Canadienne des Musiciens (CFM/FCM).

The AFM is affiliated with AFL–CIO [the largest federation of unions in the United States]; the Department of Professional Employees, the International Federation of Musicians (FIM), the National Music Council, and the Canadian Labour Congress, the federation of unions in Canada.

Founded more than 125 years ago, the purpose of the American Federation of Musicians remains the same: to elevate, protect, and advance the interests of all musicians who receive pay for their musical service.

== History ==
The roots of the musicians’ collective action began with the New York City-based Musical Mutual Protective Union, which took the first steps toward creating uniform scales for different types of musical employment in 1878. By March 1886, delegates from 15 different protective unions across the US came together to form the National League of Musicians to discuss and rectify common issues, such as competition from traveling musicians.

The American Federation of Labor recognized the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) in 1896. A group of delegates had broken away from the National League of Musicians in order to form a more egalitarian organization, inclusive to all musicians. Seeking to give meaning to the phrase &quot;In unity there is strength&quot;, the first standing resolution of the AFM was: &quot;That any musician who receives pay for his musical services, shall be considered a professional musician.&quot; The first convention, upon which the American Federation of Musicians was founded, was held October 1896 at the Hotel English in Indianapolis, Indiana. The group had 3,000 members and Owen Miller became the first AFM president. In 1896, Miller said: &quot;The only object of AFM is to bring order out of chaos and to harmonize and bring together all the professional musicians of the country into one progressive body.&quot; 

At the same time, the trade-union movement was taking hold throughout North America. Unions representing all types of laborers were forming to exercise collective strength to raise wages, improve working conditions and secure greater dignity and respect for working people. In 1887, the AFL and the Knights of Labor first invited the National League of Musicians to affiliate with the trade-union movement, but the offers produced deep divisions within the National League of Musicians. Some members objected to musicians being called laborers, insisting instead that they were &quot;artists and professionals.&quot; As the American music scene prospered and more symphony orchestras were founded, the need for a national organization for musicians increased.

In 1897, the union became international when the Montreal Musicians Protective Union and Toronto Orchestral Association joined.

By 1900, the union changed its name to the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada and was actively organizing on both sides of the border.

A 1903 resolution was passed prohibiting foreign bands taking work from domestic bands. It was followed by a 1905 letter from the AFM petitioning president Theodore Roosevelt to protect American musicians by limiting the importation of musicians from outside Canada and the US.

By 1905, an official position on the International Executive Board was created to provide Canadian representation at the federation level. Early accomplishments of the union included setting the first scales for orchestras traveling with comic operas, musical comedies and grand opera. Among the pressing issues was competition from both foreign musicians and off-duty military musicians.

In its first 10 years, the AFM had organized 424 locals and 45,000 musicians in the US and Canada. Virtually all instrumental musicians in the US were union members. In 1906, the 10-year-old organization made a donation of $1,000 to earthquake victims in San Francisco.

A 1908 appropriations bill banned armed-services musicians (exempting Marines) from competing with civilians. In 1916, Congress passed a law prohibiting all armed-services members from competing with civilians.

During the World War I era, general unemployment affected musicians. Silent films displaced some forms of traditional entertainment, and with a declining economy and other factors, many musicians were laid off.

Among the best known AFM actions was the 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike, orchestrated to pressure record companies to agree to a better arrangement for paying royalties.

=== Technology and legislation ===

In 1918, two important legislative measures, Prohibition and a 20 percent cabaret tax to support the war effort, negatively impacted many musicians. Prohibition ended after 13 years, but the cabaret tax took its toll on the music industry for many years to come.

The Copyright Act of 1909 created the first compulsory mechanical license stipulating royalty payments be paid by the user of a composer’s work, but the law excluded musicians.

In the 1920s, new technologies challenged live music for the first time. The advent of recording and radio forever changed the landscape of musician employment. At AFM conventions, the union decried the use of canned music and forbid orchestra leaders from advertising their orchestras free of charge on radio. By the end of the 1920s, many factors had reduced the number of recording companies. As the nation recovered from World War I, technology advanced and there was diversity in recording and producing music. In 1927, the first &quot;talkie&quot; motion picture was released and within two years, 20,000 musicians lost their jobs performing in theater pits for silent films. Minimum wage scales were created for vitaphone, movietone and phonograph recording work. In 1938, film companies signed their first contract with AFM at a time when musicians were losing income as phonograph records replaced radio orchestras and jukeboxes competed with live music in nightclubs.

The AFM founded the Music Defense League in 1930 to gain public support against canned music in movie theaters.

The AFM set higher scales for the recording work than for live work, negotiating the first industry-wide agreements in the labor movement. While musicians flocked to Los Angeles hoping for high-paying recording work, fewer than 200 new jobs were created by the technology.

To help musicians find fair pay and union jobs, the AFM created a booking-agent licensing policy in 1936, and in 1938, developed a similar program for licensing record companies.

While national scales were set for live musicians working on fledgling radio networks, some stations had already begun using recordings. The 1937 AFM convention mandated Weber to fight against the use of recorded music on radio. He called a meeting with representatives of radio, transcription and record companies, threatening to halt all recording work nationwide. After 14 weeks, the stations agreed to spend an additional $2 million to employ staff musicians, but the Department of Justice later ruled the agreement illegal.

Labor leader James Petrillo took command of the AFM in 1940. He took a stronger stance, challenging technological unemployment. Among the most significant AFM actions was the 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike (sometimes called the &quot;Petrillo ban&quot;), orchestrated to pressure record companies to agree to a royalty system more beneficial to the musicians. The strike forced the recording industry to establish a royalty on recording sales to employ musicians at live performances. This resulted in the Music Performance Trust Fund (MPTF), which was established in 1948 and continues to sponsor free live performances throughout the US and Canada. When the MPTF began disbursals, it became the largest single employer of live musicians in the world.

Petrillo organized a second recording ban from January 1 to December 14, 1948, in response to the Taft–Hartley Act.

In the 1950s, the MPTF was reapportioned to form the AFM Pension Fund and the Sound Recording Special Payment Fund.

Numerous labor actions in the following decades improved industry standards and working conditions for musicians. New agreements covered TV programs, cable TV, independent films and video games. Pension funds were established and musicians also secured groundbreaking contracts providing royalties for digital transmissions and from recordings of live performances.

=== AFM leadership challenged ===

Petrillo’s tactics were not universally accepted. While his 1955 negotiations had led to increased payments into the funds, the lack of a scale increase angered some full-time recording musicians.

Musicians were promised a voice at the next round of meetings in 1958, but talks broke down and a strike was called. When calls for Petrillo to reopen negotiations were rejected, a group of disgruntled Los Angeles musicians formed a dual union, the Musicians Guild of America.

In 1946, Congress passed an act known as &quot;the anti-Petrillo Act&quot; that made it a criminal offense for a union to use coercion to win observance of its rules by radio stations. Collective bargaining with broadcasters over hiring standby musicians and paying for rebroadcasts of live performances became illegal. As a result, live broadcasts on radio were almost completely eliminated.

When Petrillo retired, Herman D. Kenin took over as AFM president. In 1958–59, rank-and-file committees of recording musicians sat at the table while Kenin negotiated favorable agreements with the recording, television and jingle industries. The Musicians Guild of America was defeated in a 1960 representation election and the AFM regained bargaining rights for motion-picture studios.

=== Political lobbying ===

During the 1960s, the AFM organized its political lobbying efforts, creating the TEMPO political action committee. Among the pressing issues of the day were government funding for music programs and repeal of the 20 percent cabaret tax.

Amid the beginning of the British Invasion in 1964, Kenin lobbied directly to the US Secretary of Labor, W. Willard Wirtz, to place an embargo on rock and roll musicians coming to the US from the UK. Kenin worried about British musicians taking away jobs from Americans, contending that there was little difference between their music, making it unnecessary for the Beatles and other acts to perform. When Kenin&#x27;s desire to ban the Beatles was widely reported, Beatles fans from across the US sent letters to the AFM condemning the organization.

The AFM also sought to lend its voice to national labor issues such as the fight against right-to-work laws. In 1951, lobbying efforts against the cabaret tax paid off when nonprofit organizations, including symphony orchestras, were exempted. In 1957, Congress reduced the tax to 10 percent, resulting in a $9-million rise in nightclub bookings by 1960. In 1966, the tax was finally repealed.

=== Federal funding ===

In 1955 the AFM formally asked Congress to subsidize the arts industry. The federation cited its concern for preserving America’s cultural heritage and protecting the country’s less commercially viable styles: jazz, folk and symphonic music.

The effort paid off in 1965 when President Johnson signed 20 U.S.C. 951, creating the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). At the 1966 AFM convention, the initial $2 million in NEA appropriation was announced. Much of the subsequent growth in professional symphony orchestras in the US was a direct result of the NEA. AFM president Ray Hair said: &quot;Government arts funding is critical to the ongoing financial and artistic well-being of American professional musicians. ... For nearly 50 years NEA funding has enriched our communities, supported our jobs, and helped achieve cultural balance within virtually every congressional district.&quot;

The Parliament of Canada used the death duties of two Canadian millionaire estates to establish the Canada Council for the Arts in 1957. According to an &quot;International Musician&quot; article the council was responsible for &quot;creating an aura of musical achievement such as the country has never witnessed.&quot; In 2014 and 2015, the council allocated $155.1 million to the arts in Canada.

By 1960, tape recorders were making sound and video recordings easier and cheaper on a global scale. In 1961, the AFM participated in the Rome Convention to develop an international treaty extending copyright protection. However, because of pressure from American broadcasters, the federal government declined to sign the treaty. To date, only the US, China and North Korea have not signed the treaty. Therefore, American musicians and record companies receive no performance royalties from terrestrial AM/FM radio.

Through much of the early history of the AFM, union locals were segregated for black and white musicians. Black and white locals eventually began to merge, starting with Los Angeles in 1953, and by 1974 all locals were integrated.

===21st century===
Through lobbying efforts to amend copyright law and generate new, innovative agreements, the AFM continues its work to protect and compensate musicians in the increasingly digital world.

The AFM &amp; SAG-AFTRA Fund was created to administer and distribute statutory noninteractive digital performance and audio home recording royalties established under copyright law and royalties from various foreign territories. In 2020, more than 42,000 session musicians and vocalists in all 50 states and Canada shared $62 million in royalties collected by its Intellectual Property Rights Distribution Fund. The performance rights organization SoundExchange was established to collect and distribute performance revenue from noninteractive digital services, including those on cable, satellite, and internet webcasts. It works on behalf of 650,000 creators and has paid more than $10 billion in distributions to date.

The globalization of the industry has also increased the need for musicians to cross international borders for work. Among the challenges musicians face are regulations regarding the safe transport of instruments on planes and through customs. Disparate airline policies regarding the transportation of instruments long plagued musicians. This problem worsened after the 9/11 attacks and stricter security checks that followed. The AFM spent more than a decade trying to clarify and improve the ability of musicians to fly with instruments as carry-on baggage. These efforts resulted in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which was implemented in 2015. The law states that if the instrument fits in the airline luggage bins and the owner boards early enough to have available space in the bins, a musician cannot be forced to check their instrument.

In early 2020, the AFM faced what would become its biggest challenge yet, when the pandemic and subsequent quarantines put thousands of musicians out of work and careers on hold. The AFM quickly adapted agreements to allow live streaming of concerts and recording work to be done at home instead of in-studio.

==Composition==

According to the AFM&#x27;s records since 2006, when membership classification was first reported, about 81 percent of the union&#x27;s membership are &quot;regular&quot; members who are eligible to vote for the union. In addition to the other voting eligible &quot;life&quot; and &quot;youth&quot; classifications, the &quot;inactive life&quot; members have the rights of active union members except that &quot;they shall not be allowed to vote or hold office&quot; according to the bylaws in exchange for the rate less than &quot;life&quot; members. As of 2019, there were 60,345 &quot;regular members&quot; (83 percent of total), 11,297 &quot;life&quot; members (15 percent), 549 &quot;inactive life&quot; members (1 percent) and 880 &quot;youth&quot; members (1 percent).

==Leadership==
In June 2023, the delegates to the 102nd AFM Convention in Las Vegas elected Tino Gagliardi as AFM international president, succeeding Ray Hair, who did not seek reelection following 13 years at the helm.

<doc id="197360" wikidata="Q1033351" url="?curid=197360" title="Edmund Waller">
<text>Edmund Waller, FRS (3 March 1606 – 21 October 1687) was an English poet and politician who was Member of Parliament for various constituencies between 1624 and 1687, and one of the longest serving members of the English House of Commons.

Son of a wealthy lawyer with extensive estates in Buckinghamshire, Waller first entered Parliament in 1624, although he played little part in the political struggles of the period prior to the First English Civil War in 1642. Unlike his relatives William and Hardress Waller, he was Royalist in sympathy and was accused in 1643 of organising a plot to seize London for Charles I. He allegedly escaped the death penalty by paying a large bribe, while several conspirators were executed, including his brother-in-law Nathaniel Tomkins.

After his sentence was commuted to banishment, he lived in comfortable exile in France and Switzerland until allowed home in 1651 by Oliver Cromwell, a distant relative. He returned to Parliament after The Restoration in 1660 of Charles II; known as a fine and amusing orator, he held a number of minor offices. He largely retired from active politics after the death of his second wife in 1677, and died of edema in October 1687.

Best remembered now for his poem &quot;Song (Go, lovely rose)&quot;, Waller&#x27;s earliest writing dates to the late 1630s, commemorating events that occurred in the 1620s, including a piece on Charles&#x27;s escape from a shipwreck at Santander in 1625. Written in heroic couplets, it is one of the first examples of a form used by English poets for some two centuries; his verse was admired by John Dryden among others, while he was a close friend of Thomas Hobbes and John Evelyn.

When he died, Waller was considered a major English poet, but his reputation declined over the next century, one view seeing him as a &#x27;fairweather Royalist, an expedient Republican and mercenary bridegroom&#x27;. He is now regarded as a minor author, whose primary significance was to develop a form adapted and improved by later poets like Alexander Pope.

==Personal details==

Edmund Waller was born on 3 March 1606 at Stocks Place, Coleshill, Buckinghamshire, eldest son of Robert Waller (1560–1616) and Anne Hampden (1589–1658). He came from a family of 15, many of whom survived to adulthood, including Elizabeth (1601–?), Anne (1602–1642), Cecilia (1603–?), Robert (1606–1641), Mary (1608–1660), Ursula (1610–1692) and John (1616–1667). Cecilia married Nathaniel Tomkins, executed for his part in the 1643 plot, while Mary married Adrian Scrope, executed in 1660 as a regicide.

In addition, Waller was related to several prominent Parliamentarians; through his mother, he was distantly connected to Oliver Cromwell, while he and John Hampden were grandchildren of Griffith Hampden (1543–1591). On his father&#x27;s side, he was related to the Parliamentarian generals Sir Hardress and Sir William Waller.

In 1631, he married Anne Banks, orphaned heiress of a wealthy merchant; contracted in defiance of the Privy Council of England, the marriage was eventually approved by Charles I. Anne died in childbirth in 1634, leaving two children, Robert (1633–1652?) and Elizabeth (1634–1683).

In 1644, he re-married, this time to Mary Bracey (died 1677) and they had numerous children; since their eldest son, Benjamin, was mentally disabled, he was succeeded by Edmund Waller (1652–1700), MP for Amersham from 1689 to 1698. His youngest son Dr. Stephen Waller (1676–1708) was one of the Commissioners who negotiated the 1707 Treaty of Union. On his death, his estate was valued at the then considerable sum of £40,000 (); he left legacies to his children Margaret (1648–1690), who acted as his secretary and Benjamin&#x27;s guardian, Mary, Elizabeth, Anne, Cicely, Octavia, Dorothy and William.

==Career==
Waller attended Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, followed by Eton and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He left without a degree, and as was common in this period did a course in law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, graduating in 1622. He was first elected in 1624 as MP for Ilchester, when he was the youngest person in the Commons, then for Chepping Wycombe in 1626. On coming of age in 1627, he inherited an estate worth up to £2,500 a year, making him one of the wealthiest men in Buckinghamshire.

Returned for Amersham in 1628, he made virtually no impact on Parliament before it was dissolved in 1629, when Charles I instituted eleven years of Personal Rule. During this period, he became friends with George Morley, later Bishop of Worcester, who guided his reading and provided advice on writing, while Waller apparently paid his debts. Morley also introduced Waller to Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland; he became a member of the Great Tew Circle, which included Edward Hyde, and was greatly influenced by Falkland&#x27;s moderation and tolerance.

Nineteenth-century biographers dated his earliest work to the 1620s, largely because they commemorate events occurring in that period, but modern scholars suggest they were actually written in the mid to late 1630s in an attempt to build a career at court. As well as Charles himself, many of his works are addressed to members of the extended Percy family, such as the Countess of Carlisle, the Countess of Sunderland and the Earl of Northumberland. Hyde recorded Waller became a poet at the age of thirty, &quot;when other Men give over writing Verses&quot;.

When Charles recalled Parliament in April 1640 to approve taxes for the Bishops&#x27; Wars, Waller was re-elected for Amersham, then for St Ives in November. Despite general consensus attempts by Charles to govern without Parliament had gone too far, moderates like Hyde and Falkland were also wary of changing the balance too much the other way. John Pym, who headed the Parliamentary opposition to Charles, gave Waller responsibility for the impeachment of Sir Francis Crawley, one of the Ship Money judges, but he confirmed his Royalist sympathies by voting against the execution of Strafford in April 1641, and the removal of bishops from the House of Lords.

Unlike Hyde and Falkland who joined the king when the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Waller remained in London, apparently with Charles&#x27; permission, where he continued to support moderates like Denzil Holles who wanted a negotiated peace. In May 1643 a plot was uncovered, allegedly organised by Waller along with his brother-in-law Nathaniel Tomkins, and wealthy merchant Richard Chaloner; what apparently began as a plan to force Parliament into negotiations by withholding taxes turned into an armed conspiracy intended to allow the Royalist army to take control of London.

After Waller was arrested, he made a full confession, implicating a number of his co-conspirators; he escaped the death penalty, allegedly by paying bribes, while Chaloner and Tomkins were executed on 5 July 1643. Many moderates were forced to disavow support for a peace settlement to avoid suspicion of involvement and reaffirm their backing for military action. After spending 18 months in prison without trial, Waller was fined £10,000 and permitted to go into exile in November 1644, accompanied by his new wife Mary; however, the affair caused lasting damage to his reputation.

Waller travelled with John Evelyn in Switzerland and Italy; unlike many Royalists, he lived in some comfort using money sent to him by his mother. Probably with the support of his relations Cromwell and Scrope, the Rump Parliament allowed him to return home in January 1652. He established good relations with Cromwell, writing him a &#x27;Panegyrick&#x27; in 1655, and later supporting proposals to make him king; in a poem written after the capture of the Spanish treasure fleet in 1658, he suggested &quot;let the rich ore be forthwith melted down, and the state fixed by making him a crown&#x27;.

When Charles II returned to the throne after The Restoration, Waller commemorated the occasion with his 1660 poem &quot;To the King, upon his Majesty&#x27;s Happy Return&quot;. Reconciling past support for the Commonwealth with the restored monarchy was a problem faced by many. When asked by the King on this point, Waller is reported to have replied &quot;Poets, Sir, succeeded better at fiction than in truth&quot;. His biographer Samuel Johnson wrote (1779) that it showed &quot;a prostituted mind may retain the glitter of wit, but has lost the dignity of virtue&quot;. In 1661, he was elected to the Cavalier Parliament as MP for Hastings; he became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1663, although does not appear to have contributed papers himself. He played a prominent role in the impeachment and exile of Clarendon in 1667, and thereafter held a number of positions under the Cabal ministry.

Originally viewed as a supporter of the Court, after 1674 he gained a reputation for independence and was still regarded as one of the best speakers in the Commons. Generally an advocate of religious tolerance, especially for Protestant Nonconformists, he was however convinced of the truth of the Popish Plot in 1678 and withdrew from active politics during the 1679 to 1681 Exclusion Crisis. On the accession of James II, he was elected for Saltash in 1685.

He wrote two poems to the new king, urging reconciliation and national unity, but James suspended Parliament in November after it refused to pass his Declaration of Indulgence. Waller died at his London house in St James&#x27;s on 21 October 1687, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary and All Saints’ Church, Beaconsfield; his tomb is now grade II* listed.

==Literary works and assessment==
Waller was admired by contemporaries including John Dryden and Gerard Langbaine, although his extravagant praise for members of the court and Royal family was later parodied by Andrew Marvell in &quot;Last Instructions to a Painter&quot;. Described by Francis Atterbury as &quot;the Parent of English Verse&quot;, by the nineteenth century his work was out of favour. Edmund Gosse, author of his biography in the &quot;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, wrote: &#x27;Waller&#x27;s lyrics were at one time admired to excess, but with the exception of &quot;Go, lovely Rose&quot; and one or two others, they have greatly lost their charm&#x27;.

By 1995, the protagonist of &quot;The Information&quot;, a novel by Martin Amis, dismisses him as a &#x27;seat-warmer, air sniffer and mediocrity&#x27;. However, H. M. Redmond argued &#x27;immoderate censure of his life&#x27; had combined with &#x27;interest-killing appreciation&#x27; of his verse to &#x27;prevent a dispassionate assessment&#x27;. One suggestion is while his writing is limited, he played an important role in developing a format and style adapted and improved by Alexander Pope among others.

Much of his early poetry was written for the Caroline court, while he was famous for his &#x27;Panegyricks&#x27;, written in support of Cromwell, then both Charles II and his brother James, as well as other members of the Royal family. His longest and most ambitious work of this type portrayed the inconclusive 1665 Battle of Lowestoft; presenting it as an heroic victory and heaping praise on James, it was widely ridiculed.

He was strongly influenced by Thomas Hobbes, whose &quot;Leviathan&quot; he admired, and whose &quot;De Cive&quot; he at one point proposed to translate. His early work was far more successful than later efforts and during his exile an unlicensed collection of his poems was published in 1645. Reprinted in 1664, 1668, 1682, and 1686, they were popular in part because they were easily set to music; two volumes of previously uncollected writings, &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Tragedy Altered&quot; and &quot;The Second Part of Mr Waller&#x27;s Poems&quot; were published after his death in 1690. They included &quot;Divine Poems&quot;, self-published by Waller in 1686; most critics view them as &#x27;indifferent&#x27; and showing his decline as a writer.

<text>Bashir Noorzai is a former Afghan drug lord. He was an early supporter of the Taliban movement and later worked as an undercover agent on behalf of the U.S. government. Despite being among America&#x27;s most wanted drug traffickers, he agreed to come to New York City for a debriefing after being promised by his handlers that he would not be arrested, and was arrested ten days after his arrival. In 2008, he was convicted of smuggling heroin into the U.S. and sentenced to life imprisonment. After the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan, the 2022 US–Afghan prisoner exchange saw him released from prison in exchange for American contractor Mark Frerichs.

==Biography==
He fought the Soviet forces that occupied Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989.

He was left in charge of Kandahar after Taliban founder Mullah Omar went into hiding. He provided explosives, weapons, and militia fighters to the Taliban regime, and was one of Omar&#x27;s favorite warlords.

Noorzai was in Quetta when the September 11 attacks occurred, and soon afterwards returned to Afghanistan. In November 2001, he met with men he described as American military officials at Spinboldak, near the Afghan-Pakistani border. Small teams of U.S. Special Forces and intelligence officers were in Afghanistan at the time, seeking the support of tribal leaders. According to his lawyer, Noorzai was taken to Kandahar, where he was detained and questioned for six days by the Americans about Taliban officials and operations. He agreed to work with them and was freed, and in late January 2002 he handed over 15 truckloads of weapons, including about 400 anti-aircraft missiles, that had been hidden by the Taliban in his tribe&#x27;s territory.

On 1 June 2004, he was sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.

===Arrest===
In April 2005, U.S. authorities in New York City arrested Noorzai. He was charged with trying to smuggle more than US$50 million worth of heroin into the United States. He is one of ten people and organizations on a U.S. list of most-wanted drug traffickers. RFE/RL looks at alleged ties between Afghanistan&#x27;s former Taliban regime and the illegal narcotics trade in light of the Noorzai arrest. Noorzai was represented at his 2008 trial by New York high-profile criminal defense lawyer Ivan Fisher. The case has raised substantial questions about U.S. foreign policy abroad. In 2008 Noorzai was convicted of smuggling $50 million worth of heroin into the United States. On April 30, 2009, he appeared before Judge Denny Chin, who sentenced Noorzai to life imprisonment.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the leadership vacuum in the drug trade, following Noorzai&#x27;s capture, was filled by Juma Khan. Khan was, in turn, captured in 2010.

The &quot;Afghanistan Times&quot; reported that Taliban officials said Noorzai had been released, in the United Arab Emirates, on July 16, 2019. They reported that he would join Taliban peace negotiators, in Qatar. They incorrectly reported he had been released from the Guantanamo detention camp. However, Noorzai was not released from prison.

In the aftermath of the takeover of the country by the Taliban, the group demanded that the US release him in exchange with an American engineer, Mark Frerichs, who was kidnapped by the group in January 2020. Noorzai was released and exchanged for Frerichs on September 19, 2022 at Kabul International Airport.

<text>U.S. Robotics Corporation, often called USR, is a company that produces USRobotics computer modems and related products. Its initial marketing was aimed at bulletin board systems, where its high-speed HST protocol made FidoNet transfers much faster, and thus less costly. During the 1990s it became a major consumer brand with its Sportster line. The company had a reputation for high quality and support for the latest communications standards as they emerged, notably in its V.Everything line, released in 1996.

With the reduced usage of voiceband modems in North America in the early 21st century, USR began branching out into new markets. The company purchased Palm, Inc. for its Pilot PDA, but was itself purchased by 3Com soon after. 3Com spun off USR again in 2000, keeping Palm and returning USR to the now much smaller modem market. After 2004 the company is formally known as USR. USR is now a division of UNICOM Global, and is one of the few providers left in the modem market today. The division employs about 125 people worldwide.

== History ==

USR was founded in 1976 in Chicago, Illinois (and later moved to Skokie, Illinois), by a group of entrepreneurs, including Casey Cowell, who served as CEO for most of the company&#x27;s history, and Paul Collard who designed modems into the mid-1980s. The company name is a reference to the fictional company U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men which featured prominently in the works of Isaac Asimov. The company has stated it was named as an homage to Asimov because in his science fiction works U.S. Robots eventually became &quot;the greatest company in the known galaxy&quot;, and USR appeared in &quot;I, Robot&quot; (2004) as the fictional company itself.

In its early years (circa 1980), USR was a reseller of computers, terminals and modems. At the time, commonly available modems ran at 300 bit/s, but 1200 bit/s using the mutually incompatible Bell 212A and V.22 standards were available at much higher price points. Even in 1983, 300 bit/s remained the most common speed. In 1984, the V.22bis standard provided 2400 bit/s service, but these remained high-cost devices.
USR sold its first modem, the Courier, to corporate customers starting in 1979. In 1984, the breakup of AT&amp;T greatly lowered the cost of the testing needed for connection to the telephone network, which led to lower prices and wider use of modems. They began offering the Courier to the public in 1984.

In 1986, USR introduced their Courier HST, short for &quot;high speed transfer&quot;. Using trellis encoding, HST provided 9,600 bit/s speeds, leapfrogging the standards efforts and offering four times the performance for about twice the price of a 2400 bit/s model. In 1989 HST was expanded to 14.4 kbit/s, 16.8 kbit/s in 1992, and finally to 21 kbit/s and 24 kbit/s.

USR was not the only company making modems with proprietary protocols; Telebit&#x27;s TrailBlazer series of 1985 offered speeds up to 19.2 kbit/s, and Hayes also introduced the 9600 bit/s Express 96 (or &quot;Ping-Pong&quot;) system. However, USR became the most successful of the three, due to a marketing scheme that offered large discounts to BBS sysops. It was a favourite in this market not only for its performance, but its superb stability, with sysops suggesting new sysops &quot;Just get the Courier, you will NOT be disappointed, it is excellent.&quot;

The proprietary nature of HST allowed USR to maintain its market predominance even when off-brand V.32-based modems began selling for less than equivalent HST modems. As the price differential decreased, however, V.32-based modems eventually became a cost-effective alternative to HST. USR countered by creating ever-faster HST protocols, starting with a 16.8 kbit/s mode, and by producing &quot;dual-standard&quot; modems that were able to communicate with both HST and V.32 modems at high speeds. In spite of many modems with similar performance on the market at even lower price points, the Courier&#x27;s retained their legendary reputation for quality and reliability, &quot;Once you have used a Courier, nothing else is a modem in your book at any price. They are the very best there is.&quot;

To compete with the ever growing market for low cost consumer models, USR introduced their Sportster line. These supported only V.32 and later standards, they retained their own higher-speed HST standard only for the Couriers. During this time, Couriers were available in V.32, HST, or the more popular Courier Dual Standard models which supported both. The Sportster used the same motherboard as the Couriers, and on certain 14.4 kbit/s models a sequence of AT commands could be issued to enable the faster 16.8 kbit/s HST mode. The Courier modems remained a favorite in the BBS and emerging Internet service provider world, where they were known to run without problems for extended periods of time (although the initial large-scale deployment of Courier modems in the CompuServe network uncovered a serious bug, which would cause the modems to crash and stop answering calls under high call volumes).

A similar situation emerged a few years later when the 56 kbit/s V.90 standard was first being proposed. USR developed its own 56k standard known as X2, while a consortium of other companies introduced its own K56flex. In contrast to the success of HST, neither X2 nor K56flex saw any real market uptake, as it was clear they would soon be followed by V.90 modems. After the introduction of V.90, USR abandoned support for X2. In a further effort to reduce the retail price of its modems, USR also marketed a Winmodem that used software running on the host computer to perform some of the modem functions.

Some models of Courier modems were known for their long-term upgradeability, because they used an upgradeable DSP design. For example, when the Courier V.Everything modem was first released in 1994 under the product label &quot;Courier V.34 Ready&quot;., it shipped with only V.FC support, because V.34 had not been released. A free V.34 firmware upgrade was made available later via FidoNet, as well as the Internet. USR then surprised many early Courier V.Everything modem owners with a limited-time free offer of an X2 firmware upgrade, which added 56K speed capability. Finally, USR released a V.90 upgrade that was compatible with X2-upgraded Courier V.Everything modems. Even the 1994 hardware released pre-V.34 was fully V.90-upgradeable without hardware modification.

There was a licensing key needed for some Courier V.Everything V.90 flash upgrades. The firmware could be loaded onto the modem, but it would work in &quot;degraded&quot; V.34 mode. After paying a fee, and having the modem dial USR, a license key was installed that enabled the V.90 functions.

==Commoditization==

USR acquired Palm, Inc. in 1995 and subsequently merged with 3Com Corporation in June 1997. It was then recreated as a spin-off of 3Com in June 2000, assuming 3Com&#x27;s entire client modem business except for the Palm-related portion, which itself had been spun off with Palm three months earlier. Other portions of the original USR remained part of 3Com as the CommWorks Corporation. USR then quickly built up its device portfolio, including not only traditional dial-up modems, but also wired- and wireless-networking components.

USR was acquired by private equity firm Platinum Equity for an undisclosed amount of cash in 2005, believed to be between US$30 million and US$50 million.

By 2010 the company was focused only on the traditional modem business.

In 2013, USR was acquired by UNICOM Global.

<text>A mantra (Pali: &quot;mantra&quot;) or mantram (Devanagari: मन्त्रम्) is a sacred utterance, a numinous sound, a syllable, word or phonemes, or group of words (most often in an Indo-Iranian language like Sanskrit or Avestan) believed by practitioners to have religious, magical or spiritual powers. Some mantras have a syntactic structure and a literal meaning, while others do not.

ꣽ, ॐ (Aum, Om) serves as an important mantra in various Indian religions. Specifically, it is an example of a seed syllable mantra (bijamantra). It is believed to be the first sound in Hinduism and as the sonic essence of the absolute divine reality. Longer mantras are phrases with several syllables, names and words. These phrases may have spiritual interpretations such as a name of a deity, a longing for truth, reality, light, immortality, peace, love, knowledge, and action. Examples of longer mantras include the Gayatri Mantra, the Hare Krishna mantra, Om Namah Shivaya, the Mani mantra, the Mantra of Light, the Namokar Mantra, and the Mūl Mantar. Mantras without any actual linguistic meaning are still considered to be musically uplifting and spiritually meaningful.

The use, structure, function, importance, and types of mantras vary according to the school and philosophy of Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Sikhism. A common practice is japa, the meditative repetition of a mantra, usually with the aid of a mala (prayer beads). Mantras serve a central role in the Indian tantric traditions, which developed elaborate yogic methods which make use of mantras. In tantric religions (often called &quot;mantra paths&quot;, Sanskrit: Mantranāya or Mantramarga), mantric methods are considered to be the most effective path. Ritual initiation (abhiseka) into a specific mantra and its associated deity is often a requirement for reciting certain mantras in these traditions. However, in some religious traditions, initiation is not always required for certain mantras, which are open to all.

The word &quot;mantra&quot; is also used in English to refer to something that is said frequently and is deliberately repeated over and over.

==Etymology and origins==
The earliest mention of is found in the Vedas of ancient India and the Avesta of ancient Iran. Both Sanskrit and the equivalent Avestan go back to the common Proto-Indo-Iranian , consisting of the Indo-European &quot;to think&quot; and the instrumental suffix .
Due to the linguistic and functional similarities, they must go back to the common Indo-Iranian period, commonly dated to around 2000 BCE.

Scholars consider the use of mantras to have begun in India before 1000 BC. By the middle Vedic period (1000 BC to 500 BC) – claims Frits Staal – mantras in Hinduism had developed into a blend of art and science.
The Chinese translation is , the Japanese on&#x27;yomi reading of the Chinese being &quot;shingon&quot; (which is also used as the proper name for the Shingon sect). According to Alex Wayman and Ryujun Tajima, &quot;Zhenyan&quot; (or &quot;Shingon&quot;) means &quot;true speech&quot;, has the sense of &quot;an exact mantra which reveals the truth of the dharmas&quot;, and is the path of mantras.

According to Bernfried Schlerath, the concept of &quot;sātyas mantras&quot; is found in Indo-Iranian Yasna 31.6 and the Rigveda, where it is considered structured thought in conformity with the reality or poetic (religious) formulas associated with inherent fulfillment.

==Definition==
There is no generally accepted definition of mantra. As a result, there is a long history of scholarly disagreement on the meaning of mantras and whether they are instruments of mind, as implied by the etymological origin of the word &quot;mantra&quot;. One school suggests mantras are mostly meaningless sound constructs, while the other holds them to be mostly meaningful linguistic instruments of mind. Both schools agree that mantras have melody and a well designed mathematical precision in their construction and that their influence on the reciter and listener is similar to that is observed in people around the world listening to their beloved music that is devoid of words.

In Oxford Living Dictionary mantra is defined as a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation. Cambridge Dictionary provides two different definitions. The first refers to Hinduism and Buddhism: a word or sound that is believed to have a special spiritual power. The second definition is more general: a word or phrase that is often repeated and expresses a particularly strong belief. For instance, a football team can choose individual words as their own &quot;mantra.&quot;

Louis Renou has defined mantra as a thought. Mantras are structured formulae of thoughts, claims Silburn. Farquhar concludes that mantras are a religious thought, prayer, sacred utterance, but also believed to be a spell or weapon of supernatural power. Zimmer defines mantra as a verbal instrument to produce something in one&#x27;s mind. Agehananda Bharati defines mantra, in the context of the Tantric school of Hinduism, to be a combination of mixed genuine and quasi-morphemes arranged in conventional patterns, based on codified esoteric traditions, passed on from a guru to a disciple through prescribed initiation.

Jan Gonda, a widely cited scholar on Indian mantras, defines mantra as general name for the verses, formulas or sequence of words in prose which contain praise, are believed to have religious, magical or spiritual efficiency, which are meditated upon, recited, muttered or sung in a ritual, and which are collected in the methodically arranged ancient texts of Hinduism. By comparing the Old Indic Vedic and Old Iranian Avestan traditions, Gonda concludes that in the oldest texts, mantras were &quot;means of creating, conveying, concentrating and realizing intentional and efficient thought, and of coming into touch or identifying oneself with the essence of the divinity&quot;. In some later schools of Hinduism, Gonda suggests a mantra is sakti (power) to the devotee in the form of formulated and expressed thought. 
Frits Staal, a specialist in the study of Vedic ritual and mantras, clarifies that mantras are not rituals, they are what is recited or chanted during a ritual. Staal presents a non-linguistic view of mantras. He suggests that verse mantras are metered and harmonized to mathematical precision (for example, in the &quot;viharanam&quot; technique), which resonate, but a lot of them are a hodgepodge of meaningless constructs such as are found in folk music around the world. Staal cautions that there are many mantras that can be translated and do have spiritual meaning and philosophical themes central to Hinduism, but that does not mean all mantras have a literal meaning. He further notes that even when mantras do not have a literal meaning, they do set a tone and ambiance in the ritual as they are recited, and thus have a straightforward and uncontroversial ritualistic meaning. The sounds may lack literal meaning, but they can have an effect. He compares mantras to bird songs, that have the power to communicate, yet do not have a literal meaning. On that &quot;saman&quot; category of Hindu mantras, which Staal described as resembling the arias of Bach&#x27;s oratorios and other European classics, he notes that these mantras have musical structure, but they almost always are completely different from anything in the syntax of natural languages. Mantras are literally meaningless, yet musically meaningful to Staal. The &quot;saman&quot; chant mantras were transmitted from one Hindu generation to next verbally for over 1000 years but never written, a feat, suggests Staal, that was made possible by the strict mathematical principles used in constructing the mantras. These &quot;saman&quot; chant mantras are also mostly meaningless, cannot be literally translated as Sanskrit or any Indian language, but nevertheless are beautiful in their resonant themes, variations, inversions, and distribution. They draw the devotee in. Staal is not the first person to view Hindu mantras in this manner. The ancient Hindu Vedic ritualist Kautsa was one of the earliest scholars to note that mantras are meaningless; their function is phonetic and syntactic, not semantic.

Harvey Alper and others present mantras from the linguistic point view. They admit Staal&#x27;s observation that many mantras do contain bits and pieces of meaningless jargon, but they question what language or text doesn&#x27;t. The presence of an abracadabra bit does not necessarily imply the entire work is meaningless. Alper lists numerous mantras that have philosophical themes, moral principles, a call to virtuous life, and even mundane petitions. He suggests that from a set of millions of mantras, the devotee chooses some mantras voluntarily, thus expressing that speaker&#x27;s intention, and the audience for that mantra is that speaker&#x27;s chosen spiritual entity. Mantras deploy the language of spiritual expression, they are religious instruments, and that is what matters to the devotee. A mantra creates a feeling in the practicing person. It has an emotive numinous effect, it mesmerizes, it defies expression, and it creates sensations that are by definition private and at the heart of all religions and spiritual phenomena.

===History===
During the early Vedic period, Vedic poets became fascinated by the inspirational power of poems, metered verses, and music. They referred to them with the root &quot;dhi-&quot;, which evolved into the &quot;dhyana&quot; (meditation) of Hinduism, and the language used to start and assist this process manifested as a mantra. By the middle vedic period (1000 BC to 500 BC), mantras were derived from all vedic compositions. They included &quot;ṛc&quot; (verses from Rigveda for example), &quot;sāman&quot; (musical chants from the Sāmaveda for example), &quot;yajus&quot; (a muttered formula from the yajurveda for example), and &quot;nigada&quot; (a loudly spoken yajus). During the Hindu Epics period and after, mantras multiplied in many ways and diversified to meet the needs and passions of various schools of Hinduism. In the &quot;Linga Purana,&quot; Mantra is listed as one of the 1,008 names of Lord Shiva.

Numerous ancient mantras are found in the Saṃhitā portion of the Vedas. The Saṃhitās are the most ancient layer of the Vedas, and contain numerous mantras, hymns, prayers, and litanies. The Rigveda Samhita contains about 10552 Mantras, classified into ten books called Mandalas. A Sukta is a group of Mantras. Mantras come in many forms, including &quot;ṛc&quot; (verses from the Rigveda for example) and &quot;sāman&quot; (musical chants from the Sāmaveda for example). 

In Hindu tradition, Vedas are sacred scriptures which were revealed (and not composed) by the seers (Rishis). According to the ancient commentator and linguist, Yaska, these ancient sacred revelations were then passed down through an oral tradition and are considered to be the foundation for the Hindu tradition.

Mantras took a center stage in Tantric traditions, which made extensive ritual and meditative use of mantras, and posited that each mantra is a deity in sonic form.

===Function and structure===
One function of mantras is to solemnize and ratify rituals. Each mantra, in Vedic rituals, is coupled with an act. According to &quot;Apastamba Srauta Sutra&quot;, each ritual act is accompanied by one mantra, unless the &quot;Sutra&quot; explicitly marks that one act corresponds to several mantras. According to Gonda, and others, there is a connection and rationale between a Vedic mantra and each Vedic ritual act that accompanies it. In these cases, the function of mantras was to be an instrument of ritual efficacy for the priest, and a tool of instruction for a ritual act for others.

Over time, as the Puranas and Epics were composed, the concepts of worship, virtues and spirituality evolved in Hinduism and new schools of Hinduism were founded, each continuing to develop and refine its own mantras. In Hinduism, suggests Alper, the function of mantras shifted from the quotidian to redemptive. In other words, in Vedic times, mantras were recited a practical, quotidian goal as intention, such as requesting a deity&#x27;s help in the discovery of lost cattle, cure of illness, succeeding in competitive sport or journey away from home. The literal translation of Vedic mantras suggests that the function of mantra, in these cases, was to cope with the uncertainties and dilemmas of daily life. In a later period of Hinduism, mantras were recited with a transcendental redemptive goal as intention, such as escape from the cycle of life and rebirth, forgiveness for bad karma, and experiencing a spiritual connection with the god. The function of mantras, in these cases, was to cope with the human condition as a whole. According to Alper, redemptive spiritual mantras opened the door for mantras where every part need not have a literal meaning, but together their resonance and musical quality assisted the transcendental spiritual process. Overall, explains Alper, using Śivasūtra mantras as an example, Hindu mantras have philosophical themes and are metaphorical with social dimension and meaning; in other words, they are a spiritual language and instrument of thought.

According to Staal, Hindu mantras may be spoken aloud, &quot;anirukta&quot; (not enunciated), &quot;upamsu&quot; (inaudible), or &quot;manasa&quot; (not spoken, but recited in the mind). In ritual use, mantras are often silent instruments of meditation.

===Invocation===
For almost every mantra, there are six limbs called &quot;Shadanga&quot;. These six limbs are: Seer (Rishi), &quot;Deity&quot; (Devata), &quot;Seed&quot; (Beeja), &quot;Energy&quot; (Shakti), &quot;Poetic Meter&quot; (chanda), and &quot;Lock&quot; (Kilaka).

===Methods===

The most basic mantra is &quot;Om&quot;, which in Hinduism is known as the &quot;pranava mantra,&quot; the source of all mantras. The Hindu philosophy behind this is the premise that before existence and beyond existence is only One reality, Brahman, and the first manifestation of Brahman expressed as Om. For this reason, Om is considered as a foundational idea and reminder, and thus is prefixed and suffixed to all Hindu prayers. While some mantras may invoke individual gods or principles, fundamental mantras such as Shanti Mantra, the Gayatri Mantra and others ultimately focus on the One reality.

Japa
Mantra &quot;japa&quot; is a practice of repetitively uttering the same mantra for an auspicious number of times, the most popular being 108, and sometimes just 5, 10, 28 or 1008. &quot;Japa&quot; is found in personal prayer or meditative efforts of some Hindus, as well during formal puja (group prayers). Japa is assisted by malas (bead necklaces) containing 108 beads and a head bead (sometimes referred to as the &#x27;meru&#x27;, or &#x27;guru&#x27; bead); the devotee using their fingers to count each bead as they repeat the chosen mantra. Having reached 108 repetitions, if they wish to continue another cycle of mantras, the devotee turns the mala around without crossing the head bead and repeats the cycle. Japa-yajna is claimed to be most effective if the mantra is repeated silently in mind (manasah).

According to this school, any shloka from holy Hindu texts like the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Yoga Sutra, even the Mahabharata, Ramayana, Durga saptashati or Chandi is a mantra, thus can be part of the &quot;japa&quot;, repeated to achieve a numinous effect. The &quot;Dharmasāstra&quot; claims that the Gāyatri mantra, derived from Rig Veda verse 3.62.10, and the Purușasūkta mantra, from Rig Veda verse 10.90, are the most auspicious mantras for &quot;japa&quot; at sunrise and sunset; it is claimed to purify the mind and spirit.

==== Kirtan (chanting) ====
Kirtan is a more musical form of mantric practice. It is a common method in the bhakti traditions, such as Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Kirtan includes call and response forms of chanting accompanied by various Indian instruments (such as the tabla, mrdanga and harmonium), and it may also include dancing and theatrical performance. Kirtan is also common in Sikhism.

Tantric

Tantric Hindu traditions see the universe as sound. The supreme (para) brings forth existence through the Word (shabda). Creation consists of vibrations at various frequencies and amplitudes giving rise to the phenomena of the world.

Buhnemann notes that deity mantras are an essential part of Tantric compendia. The tantric mantras vary in their structure and length. Mala mantras are those mantras which have an enormous number of syllables. In contrast, bija mantras are one-syllabled, typically ending in anusvara (a simple nasal sound). These are derived from the name of a deity; for example, Durga yields &quot;dum&quot; and Ganesha yields &quot;gam&quot;. Bija mantras are prefixed and appended to other mantras, thereby creating complex mantras. In the tantric school, these mantras are believed to have supernatural powers, and they are transmitted by a preceptor to a disciple in an initiation ritual. Tantric mantras found a significant audience and adaptations in medieval India, Southeast Asia and numerous other Asian countries with Buddhism.

Majumdar and other scholars suggest mantras are central to the Tantric school, with numerous functions. From initiating and emancipating a tantric devotee to worshiping manifested forms of the divine. From enabling heightened sexual energy in the male and the female to acquiring supernormal psychological and spiritual power. From preventing evil influences to exorcizing demons, and many others. These claimed functions and other aspects of the tantric mantra are a subject of controversy among scholars.

Tantra usage is not unique to Hinduism: it is also found in Buddhism both inside and outside India.

===Examples===
==== Gayatri ====

:The Gayatri mantra is considered one of the most universal of all Hindu mantras, invoking the universal Brahman as the principle of knowledge and the illumination of the primordial Sun. The mantra is extracted from the 10th verse of Hymn 62 in Book III of the Rig Veda.

::ॐ भूर्भुवस्व: |तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यम् |भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि |धियो यो न: प्रचोदयात्

::&quot;Oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ&quot; &quot;tat savitur vareṇyaṃ&quot; &quot;bhargo devasya dhīmahi&quot; &quot;dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt,&quot;

::&quot;Let us meditate on that excellent glory of the divine Light (Vivifier, Sun). May he stimulate our understandings (knowledge, intellectual illumination).&quot;

==== Pavamana ====
::( 1.3.28)

::&quot;from the unreal lead me to the real, from the dark lead me to the light, from death lead me to immortality.&quot;

==== Shanti ====

:&quot;Oṁ Sahanā vavatu&quot; &quot;sahanau bhunaktu&quot; &quot;sahavīryam karavāvahai&quot; &quot;tejasvi nāvadhītamastu&quot; 
:&quot;Mā vidviṣāvahai&quot;
:&quot;Oṁ Shāntiḥ, Shāntiḥ, Shāntiḥ.&quot;

::&quot;Om! Let the Studies that we together undertake be effulgent;
::Let there be no Animosity amongst us;
::Om! Peace, Peace, Peace.&quot;
:: &quot;– Taittiriya Upanishad 2&quot;.2.2

==== In the &quot;Shiva Sutras&quot; ====
Apart from Shiva Sutras, which originated from Shiva&#x27;s tandava dance, the Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta are a collection of seventy-seven aphorisms that form the foundation of the tradition of spiritual mysticism known as Kashmir Shaivism. They are attributed to the sage Vasugupta of the 9th century C.E. &quot;Sambhavopaya&quot; (1-1 to 1–22), &quot;Saktopaya&quot; (2-1 to 2–10) and &quot;Anavopaya&quot; (3-1 to 3–45) are the main sub-divisions, three means of achieving God consciousness, of which the main technique of &quot;Saktopaya&quot; is a mantra. But &quot;mantra&quot; in this context does not mean incantation or muttering of some sacred formula. The word &quot;mantra&quot; is used here in its etymological signification. That which saves one by pondering over the light of Supreme I-consciousness is a mantra. The divine Supreme I-consciousness is the dynamo of all the mantras. &quot;Deha&quot; or body has been compared to wood, &quot;mantra&quot; has been compared to &quot;arani&quot;—a piece of wood used for kindling fire by friction; &quot;prana&quot; has been compared to fire. &quot;Sikha&quot; or flame has been compared to &quot;atma&quot; (Self); &quot;ambara&quot; or sky has been compared to Shiva. When prana is kindled by means of mantra used as arani, fire in the form of &quot;udana&quot; arises in &quot;susumna&quot;, and then just as flame arises out of kindled fire and gets dissolved in the sky, so also &quot;atma&quot; (Self) like a flame having burnt down the fuel of the body, gets absorbed in Shiva.

=== In Early Buddhism ===
One of the most ancient Buddhist mantras is the famous &quot;Pratītyasamutpāda-gāthā&quot;, also known as the dependent origination dhāraṇī. This phrase is said to encapsulate the meaning of the Buddha&#x27;s Teaching. It was a popular Buddhist verse and was used as a mantra. This mantra is found inscribed on numerous ancient Buddhist statues, chaityas, and images.

The Sanskrit version of this mantra is:ye dharmā hetuprabhavā hetuṃ teṣāṃ tathāgato hyavadat, teṣāṃ ca yo nirodha evaṃvādī mahāśramaṇaḥThe phrase can be translated as follows:Of those phenomena which arise from causes: Those causes have been taught by the Tathāgata (Buddha), and their cessation too - thus proclaims the Great Ascetic.Early Buddhist texts also contain various apotropaic chants which have similar functions to Vedic mantras. These are called parittas in Pali (Sanskrit: &quot;paritrana&quot;) and mean &quot;protection, safeguard&quot;. They are still chanted in Theravada Buddhism to this day as a way to heal, protect from danger and bless. Some of these are short Buddhist texts, like the &quot;Mangala Sutta,&quot; &quot;Ratana Sutta,&quot; and the &quot;Metta Sutta.&quot;

=== Theravada ===
According to the American Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield:

&quot;In contemporary Theravada practice, mantra practice is often combined with breathing meditation, so that one recites a mantra simultaneously with in-breath and out-breath to help develop tranquility and concentration. Mantra meditation is especially popular among lay people. Like other basic concentration exercises, it can be used simply to the mind, or it can be the basis for an insight practice where the mantra becomes the focus of observation of how life unfolds, or an aid in surrendering and letting go.&quot; 

The &quot;Buddho&quot; mantra is widespread in the Thai Forest Tradition and was taught by Ajahn Chah and his students. Another popular mantra in Thai Buddhism is &quot;Samma-Araham&quot;, referring to the Buddha who has &#x27;perfectly&#x27; (&quot;samma&quot;) attained &#x27;perfection in the Buddhist sense&#x27; (&quot;araham&quot;), used in Dhammakaya meditation.

In the Tantric Theravada tradition of Southeast Asia, mantras are central to their method of meditation. Popular mantras in this tradition include &quot;Namo Buddhaya&quot; (&quot;Homage to the Buddha&quot;) and &quot;Araham&quot; (&quot;Worthy One&quot;). There are Thai Buddhist amulet katha: that is, mantras to be recited while holding an amulet.

=== Mahayana Buddhism ===


The use of mantras became very popular with the rise of Mahayana Buddhism. Many Mahayana sutras contain mantras, bijamantras (&quot;seed&quot; mantras), dharanis and other similar phrases which were chanted or used in meditation. 

According to Edward Conze, Buddhists initially used mantras as protective spells like the &quot;Ratana Sutta&quot; for apotropaic reasons. Even at this early stage, there was an idea that these spells were somehow connected with the Dharma in a deep sense. Conze argues that in Mahayana sutras like the &quot;White Lotus Sutra&quot;, and the &quot;Lankavatara Sutra&quot;, mantras become more important for spiritual reasons and their power increases. For Conze, the final phase of the development of Buddhist mantras is the tantric phase of Mantrayana. In this tantric phase, mantras are at the very center of the path to Buddhahood, acting as a part of the supreme method of meditation and spiritual practice. 

One popular bija (seed) mantra in Mahayana Buddhism is the Sanskrit letter A (see A in Buddhism). This seed mantra was equated with Mahayana doctrines like Prajñaparamita (the Perfection of Wisdom), emptiness and non-arising. This seed mantra remains in use in Shingon, Dzogchen and Rinzai Zen. Mahayana Buddhism also adopted the Om mantra, which is found incorporated into various Mahayana Buddhist mantras (like the popular Om Mani Padme Hum).

Another early and influential Mahayana &quot;mantra&quot; or dharani is the Arapacana alphabet (of non-Sanskrit origin, possibly Karosthi) which is used as a contemplative tool in the Long Prajñāpāramitā sutras. The entire alphabet runs: a ra pa ca na la da ba ḍa ṣa va ta ya ṣṭa ka sa ma ga stha ja śva dha śa kha kṣa sta jña rta ha bha cha sma hva tsa bha ṭha ṇa pha ska ysa śca ṭa ḍhaIn this practice, each letter stood for a specific idea (for example, &quot;a&quot; stands for non-arising (anutpada), and pa stands for &quot;ultimate truth&quot; (paramārtha). As such, this practice was also a kind of mnemonic technique (&quot;dhāraṇīmukha&quot;) which allowed one to remember the key points of the teaching.

The Mahayana sutras introduced various mantras into Mahayana Buddhism, such as:

* Mahayana sutras or texts often begin with the mantra: Om̐ namaḥ sarvajñāya (or just: namaḥ sarvajñāya, &quot;Homage to omniscience&quot;) 
* Other Mahayana texts begin with Om̐ namo ratnatrayāya (Homage to the Three Jewels) 
* Shakyamuni Buddha&#x27;s Mantra: Om̐ muni muni mahāmuni śākyamuni svāhā 
* &quot;Heart sutra&quot; (&quot;Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya&quot;) mantra: Gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā
* The mantra of bodhisattva Mañjuśrī: Om̐ arapacana dhīḥ
* Prajñaparamita-devi mantra from &quot;The Sutra of Mañjuśrī&#x27;s Questions&quot;: Nama ārya prajñā pāramitāyāi svāhā 
* &quot;Kauśikaprajñāpāramitāsutra&quot; contains many Prajñaparamita mantras including: oṃ hrī śrī dhī śruti smṛti mati gati vijaye svāhā 
* A protective mantra found in the Sanskrit &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;: agaṇe gaṇe gauri gandhāri caṇḍāli mātaṅgi pukkasi saṃkule vrūsali sisi svāhā 
* Medicine Guru mantra (in the &quot;Sutra of Medicine Guru&quot;): Om̐ bhaiṣajye bhaiṣajye mahābhaiṣajya-samudgate svāhā
* Avalokiteshvara&#x27;s mantra (the Mani mantra): Om̐ maṇi padme hūṃ, first appearing in the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra&quot; (4th-5th century CE)
* Cundī dhāraṇī or mantra also first appeared in the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra&quot;: namaḥ saptānāṃ samyaksaṃbuddha koṭīnāṃ tadyathā oṃ cale cule cunde svāhā
* &quot;Amitabha Sukhavati Dhāraṇī&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;Pure Land Rebirth Mantra&quot;
* &quot;Mantra of Light of the Great Consecration&quot; (Ch: 大灌頂光真言): Om̐ Amogha Vairocana Mahāmudrā Maṇipadma Jvalapravartāya Hūṃ

=== East Asian Buddhism ===
In Chinese Buddhism, various mantras, including the Great Compassion Mantra, the Uṣṇīṣa Vijaya Dhāraṇī from the Uṣṇīṣa Vijaya Dhāraṇī Sutra, the Mahāmāyūrī Vidyārājñī Dhāraṇī, the Heart Sutra and various forms of Buddha remembrance are commonly chanted by both monastics and laymen. In China and Vietnam, a set of mantras known as the Ten Small Mantras (Chinese: 十小咒; Pinyin: &quot;Shíxiǎozhòu&quot;) was established by the monk Yulin (Chinese: 玉琳國師; Pinyin: &quot;Yùlín Guóshī&quot;), a teacher of the Qing dynasty Shunzhi Emperor (1638 – 1661), for monks, nuns, and laity to chant during morning liturgical services. This set of mantras is still chanted in modern Chinese Buddhism.

Zen Buddhism also makes use of esoteric mantras, a practice which can be traced back to the Tang dynasty. Mantras and dharanis are recited in all Zen traditions, including Japanese Zen, Korean Seon, Chinese Chan and Vietnamese Thien. One of these is the &quot;Śūraṅgama Dharani,&quot; which has been taught by various modern Chan and Zen monks, such as Venerable Hsuan Hua. This long dharani is associated with the protective deity Sitatpatra. The short heart mantra of this dharani is also popular in East Asian Buddhism.

Shaolin temple monks also made use of esoteric mantras and dharani.

==== Chinese Mantrayana and Japanese Shingon ====

Chinese Esoteric Buddhism also known as &quot;Zhēnyán&quot; (&quot;,&quot; lit. &quot;true word&quot;, which is the translation for &quot;mantra&quot;) draws extensively on mantras. This tradition was established during the Tang dynasty by Indian tantric masters like Śubhakarasiṃha, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra. Chinese esoteric Buddhist practice was based on deity yoga and the &quot;three mysteries&quot;: mantra, mudra and mandala. These three mysteries allow the Buddhist yogi to tap into the body, speech and mind of the Buddhas.

This tradition was transmitted to Japan by Kūkai (774–835), who founded the Japanese Shingon (Japanese for &quot;Zhēnyán&quot;) mantra vehicle. Kūkai saw a mantra as a manifestation of the true nature of reality which is saturated with meaning. For Kūkai, a mantra is nothing but the speech of the Buddha Mahavairocana, the &quot;ground dharmakaya&quot; which is the ultimate source of all reality. According to Kūkai, Shingon mantras contain the entire meaning of all the scriptures and indeed the entire universe (which is itself the sermon of the Dharmakaya). Kūkai argues that mantras are effective because: &quot;a mantra is suprarational; It eliminates ignorance when meditated upon and recited. A single word contains a thousand truths; One can realize Suchness here and now.&quot;

One of Kūkai&#x27;s distinctive contributions was to take this symbolic association even further by saying that there is no essential difference between the syllables of mantras and sacred texts, and those of ordinary language. If one understood the workings of mantra, then any sounds could be a representative of ultimate reality. This emphasis on sounds was one of the drivers for Kūkai&#x27;s championing of the phonetic writing system, the kana, which was adopted in Japan around the time of Kūkai. He is generally credited with the invention of the kana, but there is apparently some doubt about this story amongst scholars.

This mantra-based theory of language had a powerful effect on Japanese thought and society which up until Kūkai&#x27;s time had been dominated by imported Chinese culture of thought, particularly in the form of the Classical Chinese language which was used in the court and amongst the literati, and Confucianism which was the dominant political ideology. In particular, Kūkai was able to use this new theory of language to create links between indigenous Japanese culture and Buddhism. For instance, he made a link between the Buddha Mahavairocana and the Shinto sun Goddess Amaterasu. Since the emperors were thought to be descended form Amaterasu, Kūkai had found a powerful connection here that linked the emperors with the Buddha, and also in finding a way to integrate Shinto with Buddhism, something that had not happened with Confucianism. Buddhism then became essentially an indigenous religion in a way that Confucianism had not. And it was through language and mantra that this connection was made. Kūkai helped to elucidate what mantra is in a way that had not been done before: he addresses the fundamental questions of what a text is, how signs function, and above all, what language is. In this, he covers some of the same ground as modern day Structuralists and others scholars of language, although he comes to very different conclusions.

In this system of thought, all sounds are said to originate from &quot;a&quot;. For esoteric Buddhism &quot;a&quot; has a special function because it is associated with Shunyata or the idea that no thing exists in its own right, but is contingent upon causes and conditions. (See Dependent origination) In Sanskrit &quot;a&quot; is a prefix which changes the meaning of a word into its opposite, so &quot;vidya&quot; is understanding, and &quot;avidya&quot; is ignorance (the same arrangement is also found in many Greek words, like e.g. &quot;atheism&quot; vs. &quot;theism&quot; and &quot;apathy&quot; vs. &quot;pathos&quot;). The letter a is both visualised in the Siddham script and pronounced in rituals and meditation practices. In the Mahavairocana Sutra which is central to Shingon Buddhism it says: &quot;Thanks to the original vows of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, a miraculous force resides in the mantras, so that by pronouncing them one acquires merit without limits&quot;. [in Conze, p. 183]

A mantra is Kuji-kiri in Shingon as well as in Shugendo. The practice of writing mantras, and copying texts as a spiritual practice, became very refined in Japan, and some of these are written in the Japanese script and Siddham script of Sanskrit, recited in either language. 

===== Main Shingon Mantras =====

There are thirteen mantras used in Shingon Buddhism, each dedicated to a major deity (the &quot;thirteen Buddhas&quot; - &quot;jūsanbutsu -&quot; of Shingon). The mantras are drawn from the &quot;Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sūtra&quot;. The mantra for each deity name in Japanese, its equivalent name in Sanskrit, the Sanskrit mantra, and the Japanese version in the Shingon tradition are as follows:
# Fudōmyōō (, Acala): Sanskrit: namaḥ samanta vajrāṇāṃ caṇḍa mahāroṣaṇa sphoṭaya hūṃ traṭ hāṃ māṃ (Shingon transliteration: nōmaku samanda bazaratan senda makaroshada sowataya untarata kanman)
# Shaka nyorai (, Sakyamuni): namaḥ samanta buddhānāṃ bhaḥ (nōmaku sanmanda bodanan baku)
# Monju bosatsu (, Manjushri): oṃ a ra pa ca na (on arahashanō)
# Fugen bosatsu (, Samantabhadra): oṃ samayas tvaṃ (on sanmaya satoban)
# Jizō bosatsu (, Ksitigarbha): oṃ ha ha ha vismaye svāhā (on kakaka bisanmaei sowaka)
# Miroku bosatsu (, Maitreya): oṃ maitreya svāhā (on maitareiya sowaka)
# Yakushi nyorai (, Bhaisajyaguru): oṃ huru huru caṇḍāli mātangi svāhā (on korokoro sendari matōgi sowaka)
# Kanzeon bosatsu (, Avalokitesvara): oṃ ārolik svāhā (on arorikya sowaka)
# Seishi bosatsu (, Mahasthamaprapta): oṃ saṃ jaṃ jaṃ saḥ svāhā (on san zan saku sowaka)
# Amida nyorai (, Amitabha): oṃ amṛta teje hara hūṃ (on amirita teisei kara un)
# Ashuku nyorai (, Akshobhya): oṃ akṣobhya hūṃ (on akishubiya un)
# Dainichi nyorai (, Vairocana): oṃ a vi ra hūṃ khaṃ vajradhātu vaṃ (on abiraunken basara datoban)
# Kokūzō bosatsu (, Akashagarbha): namo ākāśagarbhāya oṃ ārya kāmāri mauli svāhā (nōbō akyashakyarabaya on arikya mari bori sowaka)

==== Other Japanese Buddhist traditions ====
Mantras are also an important element of other Japanese Buddhist traditions. The Tendai school includes extensive repertoire of Esoteric Buddhist practices, which include the use of mantras. 

Nichiren Buddhist practice focuses on the chanting of one single mantra or phrase: &quot;Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō&quot; (南無妙法蓮華経, which means &quot;Homage to the Lotus Sutra&quot;).

Japanese Zen also makes use of mantras. One example is the Mantra of Light (&quot;kōmyō shingon&quot;), which is common in Japanese Soto Zen and was derived from the Shingon sect. The use of esoteric practices (such as mantra) within Zen is sometimes termed &quot;mixed Zen&quot; (&quot;kenshū zen&quot; 兼修禪). Keizan Jōkin (1264–1325) is seen as a key figure that introduced this practice into the Soto school. A common mantra used in Soto Zen is the Śūraṅgama mantra (&quot;Ryōgon shu&quot; 楞嚴呪; T. 944A).

=== In Northern Vajrayana Buddhism ===
Mantrayana (Sanskrit), which may be translated as &quot;way of the mantra&quot;, was the original self-identifying name of those that have come to be determined &#x27;Nyingmapa&#x27;. The Nyingmapa which may be rendered as &quot;those of the ancient way&quot;, a name constructed due to the genesis of the Sarma &quot;fresh&quot;, &quot;new&quot; traditions. Mantrayana has developed into a synonym of Vajrayana. 

According to the important Mantrayana Buddhist text called the &quot;Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa&quot;, mantras are efficacious because they are manifestations of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. As such, a mantra is coextensive with the bodies of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. When one recites a mantra, one&#x27;s mind is coextensive with the mantras, and thus, one&#x27;s mind makes a connection with the mantra&#x27;s deity and their meditative power (samadhi-bala).

==== Om mani padme hum ====


Probably the most famous mantra of Buddhism is Om mani padme hum, the six syllable mantra of the Bodhisattva of compassion Avalokiteśvara (Tibetan: &quot;Chenrezig&quot;, Chinese: &quot;Guanyin&quot;). This mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteśvara. The Dalai Lama is said to be an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, and so the mantra is especially revered by his devotees.

The book &quot;Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism&quot; by Lama Anagarika Govinda, gives a classic example of how such a mantra can contain many levels of symbolic meaning.

==== Other ====
The following list of mantras is from &quot;&quot;, Volume 1, Number 2, 1973. (pp. 168–169) (augmented by other contributors). The mantras used in Tibetan Buddhist practice are in Sanskrit, to preserve the original mantras. Visualizations and other practices are usually done in the Tibetan language.

*&quot;Om vagishvara hum&quot; This is the mantra of the Mahabodhisattva Manjusri, Tibetan: Jampelyang (Wylie &quot;&#x27;jam dpal dbyangs&quot;)... The Buddha in his wisdom aspect.
*&quot;Om vajrasattva hum&quot; The short mantra for White Vajrasattva, there is also a full 100-syllable mantra for Vajrasattva.
*&quot;Om vajrapani namo hum&quot; The mantra of the Buddha as Protector of the Secret Teachings. i.e.: as the Mahabodhisattva Channa Dorje (Vajrapani).
*&quot;Om ah hum vajra guru padma siddhi hum&quot; The mantra of the Vajraguru Guru Padma Sambhava who established Mahayana Buddhism and Tantra in Tibet.
*&quot;Om tare tuttare ture mama ayurjnana punye pushting svaha&quot; The mantra of Dölkar or White Tara, the emanation of Arya Tara [Chittamani Tara]. Variants: &quot;Om tare tuttare ture mama ayurjnana punye pushting kuru swaha&quot; (Drikung Kagyu), &quot;Om tare tuttare ture mama ayu punye jnana puktrim kuru soha&quot; (Karma Kagyu).

*&quot;Om tare tuttare ture svaha&quot;, mantra of Green Arya Tara—Jetsun Dolma or Tara, the Mother of the Buddhas: om represents Tara&#x27;s sacred body, speech, and mind. Tare means liberating from all discontent. Tutare means liberating from the eight fears, the external dangers, but mainly from the internal dangers, the delusions. Ture means liberating from duality; it shows the &quot;true&quot; cessation of confusion. Soha means &quot;may the meaning of the mantra take root in my mind.&quot;

According to Tibetan Buddhism, this mantra (Om tare tutare ture soha) can not only eliminate disease, troubles, disasters, and karma, but will also bring believers blessings, longer life, and even the wisdom to transcend one&#x27;s circle of reincarnation.
Tara representing long life and health.
*&quot;Oṃ amaraṇi jīvantaye svāhā&quot; (Tibetan version: oṃ ā ma ra ṇi dzi wan te ye svā hā) The mantra of the Buddha of limitless life: the Buddha Amitayus (Tibetan Tsépagmed) in celestial form.

=== In Bon ===
There are also numerous mantras in the Bön religion such as &quot;Om Ma Tri Mu Ye Sa Le Du&quot;. 

== Zoroastrianism ==

In Zoroastrianism, the use of mantras, commonly called manthra (), goes back to Zarathustra himself, who describes his role as a prophet of the creator deity Ahura Mazda explicitly as a knower of mantras (; ). In the Zoroastrian tradition, a mantra is usually a shorter inspired utterance that accompanies religious rituals. They differ from the longer, often eight-syllable praise songs (called Yasht in the Avesta) as well as the often eleven-syllable songs (called Gathas in the Avesta as well as in the Vedas). 

The four most important Zoroastrian mantras are the Ahuna Vairya, the Ashem Vohu, the Yenghe hatam, and the Airyaman ishya. The &quot;Ashem Vohu&quot; states: 

Both Vedic and Avestan mantras have a number of functional similarities. One of these is the idea that truth, when properly expressed in the mantra, can compel a deity to grant the speaker&#x27;s request (compare Sacca-kiriya). Another similarity is the Vedic and Avestic association of mantras with paths, so that a properly formulated mantra can open a path to the deity addressed. Because of the etymological and conceptual similarity, such religious utterances must therefore have already been known during the common Indo-Iranian period, when the people of the Avesta and of the Vedas formed a single people. They are, therefore, not derived from the Vedic tradition, but represent an independent development of ancient Iran, corresponding to that in ancient India. The study of their commonalities is therefore important for understanding the poetic and religious traditions of the early Indo-Iranians.

== Jainism ==

In Jainism mantras are mainl used for praising the omniscient enlightened ones (Arihants), or praising the five supreme types of beings (Pañca-Parameṣṭhi). Some mantras are also used for seeking forgiveness, or to enhance intellect, prosperity, wealth or fame. There are many mantras in Jainism; most of them are in Sanskrit or Prakrit, but in the last few centuries, some have been composed in Hindi or Gujrati languages. Mantras, couplets, are either chanted or sung, either aloud or by merely moving lips or in silence by thought.

===Namokar===
Some examples of Jain mantras are Bhaktamara Stotra, Uvasagharam Stotra and Rishi Mandal Mantra. The greatest is the Namokar or Namokar Mantra. Acharya Sushil Kumar, a self-realized master of the secrets of the Mantra, wrote in 1987: &quot;There is a deep, secret science to the combination of sounds. Specific syllables are seeds for the awakening of latent powers. Only a person who has been initiated into the vibrational realms, who has actually experienced this level of reality, can fully understand the Science of Letters...the Nomokar Mantra is a treasured gift to humanity of unestimable (sic) worth for the purification, upliftment and spiritual evolution of everyone.&quot;. His book, The Song of the Soul, is a practical manual to unlock the secrets of the mantra. &quot;Chanting with Guruji&quot; is a compilation of well-known Jain mantras, including the Rishi Mandal Mantra.

The Navkar Mantra (literally, &quot;Nine Line Mantra&quot;) is the central mantra of Jainism. &quot;It is the essence of the gospel of the Tirthankars.&quot;
The initial 5 lines consist of salutations to various purified souls, and the latter 4 lines are explanatory in nature, highlighting the benefits and greatness of this mantra.

According to the timeperiods of this world or the Kaals, we are living in the era of Pancham Kaal or Fifth Kaal. It started 4 months after the Nirvana of the last tirthankar of Jainism, Mahaveer Swami. In the Pancham Kaal we are only eligible to know these basic 5 lines and the concluding 4 lines of the Namokar Mantra, but it is believed that the mantra exceeds till infinity. If it is chanted with complete faith, it could even do or undo the impossible. Jains also believe that it is the elementary form of all other Mantras. It is renowned as the King of all Mantras . It is also held that even the Mantras of other ancient religions like Hinduism &amp; Buddhism are also derived from the Navkar Mantra. Indeed, it is held that 8.4 million Mantras have been derived from the Navkar Mantra.The Mantra is as follows (Prakrit, English):

One of the best approach to chant the Namokar Mantra while keeping in mind the flow of the chakras is to focus on each chakra as you recite each phrase of the mantra . Here is a suggested sequence :

1. Begin by taking a few deep breaths and focusing your attention on the base of your spine, where the first chakra (Muladhara) is located. As you inhale, imagine energy flowing up from the earth and into your root chakra.

2. As you recite &quot;Namo Arihantanam,&quot; visualize a bright white light at the base of your spine and feel the energy rising up through your body while bowing to all Arihants at the Same Time.

3. As you recite &quot;Namo Siddhanam,&quot; focus on your second chakra (Svadhisthana), located in the lower abdomen. Visualize a warm orange light here, and feel the energy of creativity while bowing to all Siddhas.

4. As you recite &quot;Namo Ayariyanam,&quot; bring your attention to your third chakra (Manipura), located in the solar plexus. Imagine a bright yellow light here, representing personal power and will while bowing to all Arihants at the same Time.

5. As you recite &quot;Namo Uvajhayanam,&quot; focus on your fourth chakra (Anahata), located in the center of your chest. Visualize a green light here, representing love and compassion while bowing to all Upadhayas at the Same time. 

6. As you recite &quot;Namo Loye Savva Sahunam,&quot; bring your attention to your fifth chakra (Vishuddha), located in the throat. Imagine a blue light here representing communication and self- expression while bowing to all Sadhus in the Dhai Dweep.

7. As you recite &quot;Eso Panch Namukaro,&quot; focus on your sixth chakra (Ajna), located in the center of your forehead Visualize a deep purple light here representing intuition and spiritual insight.

8. Finally, as you recite &quot;Savva Pavappanasano,&quot; bring your attention to your seventh chakra (Sahasrara), located at the crown of your head. Imagine a bright white light here, representing spiritual enlightenment and connection to the divine entity.

Repeat the mantra several times, moving

your awareness up through each chakra

with each phrase. This can help to

balance and activate your energy centers.

===Universal compassion===
&quot;Pratikraman&quot; also contains the following prayer:


===Forgiveness===
Forgiveness is one of the main virtues Jains cultivate. &quot;Kṣamāpanā&quot;, or supreme forgiveness, forms part of one of the ten characteristics of &quot;dharma&quot;. &lt;br&gt;In the &quot;pratikramana&quot; prayer, Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures—even from &quot;ekindriyas&quot; or single sensed beings like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and doing routine activities. Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, &quot;Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ.&quot; &quot;Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ&quot; is a Prakrit phrase literally meaning &quot;may all the evil that has been done be fruitless.&quot;

In their daily prayers and samayika, Jains recite the following &quot;Iryavahi sutra&quot; in Prakrit, seeking forgiveness from literally all creatures while involved in routine activities:

May you, O Revered One, voluntarily permit me. I would like to confess my sinful acts committed while walking. I honour your permission. I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them. I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on a living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed, which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with earth, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.
==Sikhism==

In the Sikh religion, a &quot;mantar&quot; or &quot;mantra&quot; is a Shabad (Word or hymn) from the Adi Granth to concentrate the mind on God. Through repetition of the mantra, and listening to one&#x27;s own voice, thoughts are reduced and the mind rises above materialism to tune into the voice of God.

Mantras in Sikhism are fundamentally different from the secret mantras used in other religions. Unlike in other religions, Sikh mantras are open for anyone to use. They are used openly and are not taught in secret sessions but are used in front of assemblies of Sikhs.

The Mool Mantar, the first composition of Guru Nanak, is the second most widely known Sikh mantra.

The most widely known mantra in the Sikh faith is &quot;Wahe Guru.&quot; According to the Sikh poet Bhai Gurdas, the word &quot;Wahe Guru&quot; is the Gurmantra, or the mantra given by the Guru, and eliminates ego.

According to the 10th Sikh Master, Guru Gobind Singh, the &quot;Wahe Guru&quot; mantra was given by God to the Order of the Khalsa, and reforms the apostate into the purified.

The influence of Chinese Esoteric Buddhism during the Six Dynasties period and the Tang led to the widespread use of Buddhist esoteric practices in other Chinese religions such as Taoism. This included the use of mantras. Mantras are often still used in Chinese Taoism, such as the words in &quot;Dàfàn yǐnyǔ wúliàng yīn&quot; (大梵隱語無量音), the recitation of a deity&#x27;s name. Another example of a Taoist mantra is found in one of the most popular liturgies in Taoism (dating from the Tang dynasty), the &quot;Pei-tou yen-sheng ching&quot; (&quot;The North Star Scripture of Longevity&quot;), which contains a long mantra called the &quot;North Star Mantra.&quot; The text claims that this mantra &quot;can deliver you from disaster,&quot; &quot;ward off evil and give you prosperity and longevity,&quot; &quot;help you accumulate good deeds&quot; and give you peace of mind.

The Indian syllable &quot;om&quot; (唵) is also used in Taoist esotericism. After the arrival of Buddhism many Taoist sects started to use Sanskrit syllables in their mantras or talisman as a way to enhance one&#x27;s spiritual power aside from the traditional Han incantations. One example of this is the &quot;heart mantra&quot; of Pu Hua Tian Zun (普化天尊), a Taoist deity manifested from the first thunder and head of the &quot;36 thunder gods&quot; in orthodox religious Taoism. His mantra is &quot;Ǎn hōng zhā lì sà mó luō - 唵吽吒唎薩嚩囉&quot;. Taoist believe this incantation to be the heart mantra of Pu Hua Tian Zun which will protect them from bad qi and calm down emotions. Taoist mantra recitation may also be practiced along with extensive visualization exercises.

There are also mantras in Cheondoism, Daesun Jinrihoe, Jeung San Do and Onmyōdō.

Other Chinese religions have also adopted the use of mantras. These include:
*&quot;Námó Tiānyuán Tàibǎo Āmítuófó&quot; (南無天元太保阿彌陀佛) The mantra of Xiantiandao and Shengdao in Chinese.
*&quot;Wútàifó Mílè&quot; (無太佛彌勒) The mantra of Yiguandao in Chinese.
*&quot;Guānshìyīn Púsà&quot; (觀世音菩薩) The mantra of the Li-ism in Chinese.
*&quot;Zhēnkōng jiāxiàng, wúshēng fùmǔ&quot; (真空家鄉，無生父母) The mantra of the Luojiao in Chinese.
*&quot;Zhōng Shù Lián Míng Dé, Zhèng Yì Xìn Rěn Gōng, Bó Xiào Rén Cí Jiào, Jié Jiǎn Zhēn Lǐ Hé&quot; (忠恕廉明德，正義信忍公，博孝仁慈覺，節儉真禮和) The mantra of the Tiender and the Lord of Universe Church in Chinese.
*&quot;Qīngjìng Guāngmíng Dàlì Zhìhuì Wúshàng Zhìzhēn Móní Guāngfó&quot; (清淨光明大力智慧無上至真摩尼光佛) The mantra of the Manichaeism in Chinese.

<text>James Caesar Petrillo (March 16, 1892 – October 23, 1984) was the leader of the American Federation of Musicians, a trade union of professional musicians in the United States and Canada. 

==Biography==
Petrillo was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Though, in his youth, Petrillo played the trumpet, he finally made a career out of organizing musicians into the union starting in 1919.

Petrillo became president of the Chicago Local 10 of the musician&#x27;s union in 1922, and was president of the American Federation of Musicians from 1940 to 1958. Petrillo stepped down as president in 1958. 

The round-faced, bespectacled Petrillo dominated the union with absolute authority. His most significant actions were banning all commercial recordings by union members from 1942–1944 and again in 1948 to pressure record companies to improve royalty payments to musicians. These were called the &quot;Petrillo bans&quot;.

==Radio==
Petrillo joined the orchestra at WBBM in Chicago, Illinois, in 1937. For a decade, he had been assistant conductor and orchestra member at three Chicago theaters. In 1940, he became the conductor of the WBBM orchestra. In 1943, he was promoted to music director at WBBM, &quot;supervising all live and recorded music on the station&quot;. His orchestra was featured on the CBS program &quot;Make Mine Music&quot; that debuted in May 1948.

==Death==
Petrillo died October 23, 1984, at St. Joseph Hospital in Chicago. He was 92.

==In popular culture==
Petrillo was unique among AFM presidents in that he was well known to the US and Canadian general public, especially during and after the 1942–1944 recording ban and was frequently referenced in pop culture of that era. For example, Phil Harris, the band leader on the Jack Benny radio show, claims on the show to have been married to his wife, Alice Faye, by Petrillo. When Jack Benny asks how Petrillo could do this, Harris replies &quot;Why not? My dues was paid up!&quot; On another occasion Rochester is asked to blow the car horn by putting it in his mouth, and he replies &quot;Petrillo won&#x27;t let me!&quot; After Harris helped his children with their homework, the teacher had to correct his work. According to his daughter, &quot;Teacher said George Washington was our first president, not Petrillo.&quot; 

In the 1945 Crosby/Bergman film, &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;, when Crosby&#x27;s character, Father O&#x27;Malley, is asked how he was successful in tracking down a long-missing musician, he points to the sky and quips, &quot;I went straight to the top—Petrillo!&quot;

In 1945 or 1946, Robertson Davies had his &quot;alter ego&quot; write in a newspaper column, later collected in &quot;The Diary of Samuel Marchbanks&quot;, &quot;Then to a party, where I showed my prowess at those games where you have to fill out forms saying who Cain&#x27;s wife was, and whether it was Lincoln or Petrillo who said &#x27;We must save the Union at all costs.

On the Fred Allen show of October 13, 1946, during a satire of radio advertising set to the music of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado,&quot; Allen described an elaborate show involving hundreds of musicians in locations around the world, then lamented that it would all have to be called off. To the tune of &quot;Tit-Willow,&quot; Allen sang,

In the 1947 recording of &quot;Huggin&#x27; And A Chalkin&#x27;&quot; Johnny Mercer sings &quot;...when I met another fella with some chalk in his hand coming around the other side (it was Patrillo)&quot;. In the 1947 Bob Hope film &quot;My Favorite Brunette&quot;, a man says an imaginary George Washington is playing the fife all night long, and Hope replies &quot;Why don&#x27;t you tell Petrillo about it.&quot; Jon and Sondra Steele referred to Petrillo as &quot;Little Caesar&quot; on the B-side of their 1948 hit, &quot;My Happiness&quot;, on the song called &quot;They All Recorded To Beat The Ban&quot;. A song based on the Mulberry Bush nursery rhyme, talking about the 1947-1948 ban.

The 1950 Warner Bros. animated short &quot;Hurdy-Gurdy Hare&quot;, starring Bugs Bunny, ends with Bugs making large amounts of money by having a monkey turn a street organ while a gorilla collects donations. Bugs quips, &quot;I sure hope Petrillo doesn&#x27;t hear about this!&quot; (The 1948 strike was ongoing at the time &quot;Hurdy-Gurdy Hare&quot; was in production.)

In the 1950 burlesque revue &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Girl&quot;, the comedians Bobby Faye and Leon DeVoe, playing anti-nudist street preachers, mention that the Devil has &quot;two horns.&quot; DeVoe then jokes, &quot;Two horns? Brother, we&#x27;ll have to speak to Petrillo about 
that!&quot; 

On the November 12, 1950 radio broadcast of the NBC variety program &quot;The Big Show&quot;, Groucho Marx, hosting a parody of his game show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, makes a joke about bandleader &quot;Abe Lyman of Illinois&quot; becoming president; Composer and bandleader Meredith Willson replies, &quot;That must have been before Petrillo.&quot;; Groucho then quips, &quot;Everything has been before Petrillo!&quot;

Slim Gaillard&#x27;s 1951 song &quot;Federation Blues&quot; (which is entirely about the musician&#x27;s union) begins: &quot;You may play an instrument and think that you&#x27;re a killer / But you still ain&#x27;t get nowhere till you see J.C. Petrilla.&quot;

In the 1952 film &quot;Road to Bali&quot;, Bob Hope shows Bing Crosby an instrument he&#x27;s been using in his snake-charmer act. He quips, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ve been playing this flute all night. Have to clear it with Petrillo.&quot; There is a similar reference in the Hope picture &quot;My Favorite Brunette&quot;.

In the musical &quot;Sugar&quot;, two musicians witness the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre. The gangsters are issued instructions to search for them in the song &quot;Tear the Town Apart&quot;, which ends with &quot;I&#x27;ll call Petrillo&quot;. 

Over the closing credits of many music and variety television shows in the 1950s, the announcer would read &quot;All musicians on this program are members of the American Federation of Musicians, James C. Petrillo, President,&quot; or words to that effect.

The Petrillo Bandshell, in Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park, is named after James Petrillo.

In the Lord Buckley riff &quot;The Hip Gahn&quot;, there is a reference to &quot;the Indian Petrillo&quot; when the Indian people are planning a big musical party for Gandhi after independence is achieved.

<text>Florenceville-Bristol is a former town in the northwestern part of Carleton County, New Brunswick, Canada along the Saint John River. It held town status prior to 2023 and is now part of the town of Carleton North.

==History==
Florenceville was originally known as Buttermilk Creek. In 1855 it was renamed Florenceville to honour Florence Nightingale, the famous Crimean War nurse. Florenceville was on the west side of the Saint John River and there the first post office and commercial section of the village was situated. In later years East Florenceville, previously known as Buckwheat Flats, became the commercial centre with five grocery stores and several other small businesses. There is a small strip mall along with several convenience stores and restaurants.
The former village of &quot;Bristol&quot; is located on the Saint John River, in Carleton County, New Brunswick, Canada, approximately 5 kilometres north of Florenceville. It was named after the city of Bristol, England. The name replaced Kent Station in the 1880s.

Present-day Bristol was the site of a battle between Micmac and Maliseet peoples. The area was originally named Shiktehawk, from the Maliseet for &quot;where he killed him&quot;. The name was changed when the New Brunswick Railway was constructed and railway officials were unable to pronounce the name correctly. Bristol is located where the Big Shiktehawk and Little Shiktehawk Streams empty into the Saint John River. This was an important stopping point for Native peoples as it was the start of the cross province route. They would canoe up the Big Shiktehawk Stream to Divide where they would portage a short distance to the Miramichi River and make their way to the eastern coast of New Brunswick.

On 1 January 2023, Florenceville-Bristol amalgamated with Bath, Centreville and all or part of nine local service districts to form the new town of Carleton North. The community&#x27;s name remains in official use.

Mountain View Packers is a business that specializes in the processing of potatoes and cauliflower for the fresh market. Mountain View Packers sources all of their potatoes from local farmers while the cauliflower is grown on site at their own farm.

Florenceville-Bristol is also home to H.J. Crabbe &amp; Sons Lumber Mill. This long-running family business specializes in its quality softwood lumber made mainly from Balsam Fir and White Spruce. The company has also recently built a new mill in the town to produce wood stove pellets in order to use more of what would be scrap material to help cut down on waste.

The original schools became the elementary schools. Eventually these were replaced by an elementary school on the east side of the river. The Regional High School became a middle school when Carleton North High School was built in Bristol, NB. It was later decided that starting in the year 1996 the middle school students would not begin high school until grade 9.

Bristol is the home of Carleton North High School as well as Bristol Elementary School.

==Physical geography==
Florenceville-Bristol lies within the Appalachian Mountain Range. The town sits in the Saint John River Valley. On each side of the town lie rolling mountains peaking at 300–400 metres. The borough of Florenceville lies on a flat that has extremely rich soil due to past volcanic activity before the last ice age. The borough of Bristol also lies on a flat, but much lower to the river and lower parts of the borough floods during the spring.

==Geology==
The bedrock underlying Florenceville-Bristol at its oldest is part of the White Head Formation consisting of limestone and calcareous shales of Late Ordovician to Early Silurian in age. Later in history more sedimentary rocks were deposited forming the Smyrna Mills Formation during the Silurian, consisting of shales, limestones, and conglomerates. The range of mountains from North to South along the Eastern side of the Saint John River known as Carr Mountain, The Pinnacle, and Oakland Mountain (N to S) are also part of the Smyrna Mills Formation and consist of mafic volcanic flows (basalt) and tuff. Within these mountains there are also two gabbro tubes that are Early Devonian in age. These tubes probably were the magma feeding tubes for volcanic flow that would have once overlain the existing rock, but have since been eroded.
Florenceville-Bristol are also extensively terraced with sands and gravels from both the workings of the Saint John River and its tributaries and also from the existence of a huge post-glacial lake that existed in the area for some time after the last Ice Age. In the areas that the bedrock is not covered by this aggregate material, the bedrock is covered by a thin veneer of glacial till.
There is also an extensive fault trending through Florenceville-Bristol from NE to SW which the Saint John River follows for a short distance through the town, causing its seemingly odd bend in flow in the local area.

==Climate==

The town gets a fair amount of precipitation, although major paralyzing snow and rain storms such as blizzards and hurricanes are uncommon but do happen on occasion. On average, Florenceville receives approximately 1100 mm of precipitation per year. Snowfall is common between late November and early April, and snow usually stays on the ground beginning in December. Flooding occurs during the spring of most years and affects the low-lying areas of Florenceville-Bristol.

==Attractions==
It also has a free public art gallery. The Andrew and Laura McCain Gallery is a non-profit, community-supported gallery that shows about nine exhibitions a year of everything from exhibitions on loan from the National Gallery of Canada to the work of local school children.

Florenceville-Bristol is also home to the New Brunswick Potato Museum (Potato World) and Shogomoc Historical Railway Site. The Shogomoc Historical Railway Site showcases a restored CPR train station and three CPR cars and is home to Hunter Brothers Farm Market and Corn Maze.

The town celebrates many festivals throughout the year; Festival of Flavour, which takes place August and showcases a variety of wine related events, Canada Day-July, Snow Blast- February, Haunted Train October, Buttermilk Creek Fall Festival-September and more.

Throughout the summer season, July to September, the town is host to an outdoor summer market, every Thursday from 10-2 pm at the Riverside Park. The outdoor summer market features food, produce, craft, woodworking, flower, baked goods, local meat and jewellery vendors. Each week showcases a different musical performance from local entertainers.

The town is the site of the Florenceville Bridge, a covered bridge built in 1907 that is unique in New Brunswick in combining a wooden covered bridge with steel trusses for the central spans over the Saint John River.

Located just outside the town limits is a replica Noah&#x27;s Ark, a 2/3-scale model of the Biblical Ark that Noah built, as described in the Christian Old Testament. The replica ark contains the offices and student dorms for a private Bible school, The School of The Spirit, run by the Burnham Road Ministries. The sight of a 300-foot boat in the middle of potato fields within sight of Bristol and Oakland Mountain often attracts curious visitors.

<text>The Azande are an ethnic group in Central Africa speaking the Zande languages (whose classification is uncertain). They live in the south-eastern part of the Central African Republic, the north-eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the south-central and south-western parts of South Sudan. 
 The Congolese Azande live in Orientale Province along the Uele River; Isiro, Dungu, Kisangani and Duruma. The Central African Azande live in the districts of Rafaï, Bangasu and Obo. The Azande of South Sudan live in Central, Western Equatoria and Western Bahr al-Ghazal States, Yei, Maridi, Yambio, Tombura, Deim Zubeir, Wau Town and Momoi.

==History==
The Azande were formed by a military conquest during the first half of the 18th century. They were led by two dynasties that differed in origin and political strategy. The Vungara clan created most of the political, linguistic, and cultural parts. A non-Zande dynasty, the Bandia, expanded into northern Zaire and adopted some of the Zande customs. In the early 19th century, the Bandia people ruled over the Vungara and the two groups became the Azande people. They lived in the savannas of what is now the southeastern part of Central African Republic. After the death of a king, the king&#x27;s sons would fight for succession. The losing son would often establish kingdoms in neighboring regions, making the Azande Kingdom spread eastward and northward. Sudanese raids halted some of northward expansion later in the 19th century. As a consequence of European colonialism in the 19th century, the territory inhabited by the Azande was divided by Belgium, France, and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.

During his travels in the late 1870s, the Austrian photographer Richard Buchta took photographs of Azande that were used in European publications about Central Africa and constitute an important source of historical documentation.

The Azande are considered to be one of the last ethnic groups to move into the region and were the only group that did not engage in an agro-pastoral lifestyle. The Azande were considered skilled metalworkers in pre-colonial Sudan. Although the Azande did not originate in South Sudan, many other ethnic groups in the region also migrated into the region though the Azande&#x27;s late arrival has made them the target of some cross-ethnic animosity.

In 2015, conflict between the Azande and the Dinka ethnic group in the city of Yambio, Western Equatoria state led SPLA chief Paul Malong Awan to instruct soldiers to open fire on anyone insubordinate to his directives. Awan implemented plans to soothe the situation in the region as ethnic tensions flared.

Amnesty International documented evidence of war crimes in 2021 as warring factions from the larger Dinka and Nuer ethnic groups attacked the Azande and Balanda Bviri ethnic groups from the Western Equatoria region. Additional conflict broke out between Azande and Balanda factions as well.

=== Zande Scheme ===
In 1938, the Governor of Sudan ordered a survey of areas of modern-day South Sudan by Dr. J.D. Tothill, who previously oversaw agriculture in British Uganda, to evaluate the region&#x27;s potential for agricultural production. The Azande region was selected for agricultural experimentation because it was designated as food secure. The British got tribal and Indigenous leaders to support the plan and attempted to run a propaganda campaign to urge the local community to abide by the Azande Scheme. The Scheme was organized to reduce reliance on imports and promote self-sufficiency. It emphasized growth and processing of valuable commodities for local use and export. The exports were supposed to pay for necessary imports. Originally hailed as a success by many scholars, the program largely failed, partly because of the Azande&#x27;s relative isolation to trading ports and lack of sufficient infrastructure to bring in the machinery required to build a finishing and manufacturing sector in such a rural area. Additionally, the roads were not of adequate quality for exports and the British government deemed the prices too steep to justify. The project required extensive human and monetary capital investment which the British government realized was too substantial. Because of this isolation, many Azande have moved to towns closer to major roads.

Though the plan emphasized cotton, crops that maintained soil health were promoted and land was allocated specifically for palm oil production to assure substantial yield and quality. The plan included cattle farming which the British identified as deficient prior to the Zande Scheme. Experimental agriculture was introduced to eventually reduce cotton as the region&#x27;s primary crop. Coupled with the agricultural development, the British built industrial infrastructure further north near Khartoum to process the cotton and export it. Though the plan eventually failed, its ambitions were to turn Sudan into a wealthy state by the 1970s and was initially regarded as being on track to reach or exceed the goal.

The plan&#x27;s failures were attributed not only to lack of resources but failure to adequately train the population to shift from older agricultural methods. An immediate retrospective of the plan&#x27;s failure pointed to lack of bureaucratic oversight in enforcing the tenets of the plan, leading to homestead mismanagement. When entrenched methods of farming proved increasingly difficult to dissuade, experimental farming techniques required additional investment to compensate for inefficiencies. These additional costs played a role in leading the British to abandon the project.

==Name==
The word Azande means &quot;the people who possess much land&quot;, and refers to their history as conquering warriors. Variant spellings include Zande, Azande, Azandeh, Azende, Bazende, Zandeh, A-Zandeh, and Sandeh. Another name is Adio.

The onomatopoeic name Niam-Niam suggests cannibalism and was sometimes used for the Azande people. It was possibly circulated intentionally to create fear among ethnic groups in the Azande&#x27;s period of regional conquest. The name shows up on 19th-century maps of Southern Sudan as is now considered pejorative. First used by other tribes in southern Sudan, it was later adopted by Westerners, who frequently used it to refer to the Azande in the 18th and early 19th century. The British Museum website indicates as spelling variants Niam niam, Niam-niam, Nyam nyam, Nyam-nyam, Neam Nam, Neam Neam, Neam-Nam, and Neam-Neam. The Turkish word for cannibal is &quot;yamyam&quot;, deriving from this name.

The plant species Impatiens niamniamensis is named after the Azande people.

==Demographics==

The Azande population is spread over three Central African countries: South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Azande Kingdom extends from the fringes of the South-central and Southwest Upper basin of South Sudan to the semitropical rain forests in Congo, and into the Central African Republic.

Estimates of Azande speakers reported in SIL Ethnologue are 730,000 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 62,000 in the Central African Republic and 350,000 in South Sudan.

===Settlements===

The types of houses that the Azande built were made from mud and grass, which they framed around wooden poles and thatched with grass. Each household was built around a courtyard so that they can gather and converse with each other. Adjacent to these courtyards were kitchen gardens that were for plants that did not require large scale farming such as pineapples and mangos.

In order to implement the Zande Scheme, the British sought to establish new settlements in the region, centered around cotton ginneries. In order to improve access throughout the region to encourage commutes between settlements in the region, the British contracted Azande laborers to modernize 100 miles of roadway and construct bridges to traverse rivers. The British also constructed agricultural training facilities and experimental farms in Yambio and pushed urbanization schemes in the region.

The British resettled 60,000 Azande people into newly constructed settlements of 50 families named &quot;gbarias&quot;. These settlements helped the British facilitate oversight concerning their plan&#x27;s implementation as well as the development of academic and medical institutions. Families were given 25-40 acres of land and answered to a &quot;gbaria&quot; chief.

===Social and political organizations===
The Azande were organized into chiefdoms that can also be called kingdoms. The Avongara were the nobility and passed it down through their lineage. Chiefs had many roles within the chiefdoms such as being military, economic, and political leaders. All the unmarried men were laborers and warriors.

Within the chiefdoms clan affiliation was not stressed as important at the local level. They had &quot;local groups&quot; that were similar to &quot;political organizations&quot;.

Colonial records described the Azande as &quot;individualists&quot; who, prior to villagization under the Zande Scheme, lived together in family groups on homesteads with women carrying out agricultural duties.

Sleeping sickness caused internal migrations and social reorganization among the Zande people, leading them to coalesce around paths of travel, which meant that they exhausted soil nutrients near thoroughfares.

==Agriculture==
The Azande are mainly small-scale farmers. Crops include maize, rice, groundnuts (also known as peanuts), sesame, cassava and sweet potatoes. Fruits grown in the area include mangos, oranges, bananas, pineapples, and also sugar cane. Zandeland is also full of palm oil and sesame. From 1998 to 2001, Zande agriculture was boosted since World Vision International bought agricultural produce.

The British colonial authority noted in 1948 that the importation of mangoes into the Azande region from the Congo around the turn of the 20th century. In the ensuing years, mangoes grew to prominence being planted throughout the Zande territory with &quot;avenues&quot; of trees surrounding many of the roads in the region around the middle of the 20th century.

Since then, the Azande have hunted and farmed millet, sorghum, and corn. Major cash crops include cassava and peanuts.

The region in which the Azande live has two seasons. During the rainy season the women and men both help get food from the river. Women help with the fishing in dammed streams and shallow pools collecting fish, snakes, and crustaceans. Men make and set up traps in the river to help with the collection of food. Another food that the Azande collect and eat is termites which are their favorites.

==Language and literature==
The Azande speak Zande, which they call Pa-Zande, which has an estimated 1.1 million speakers. Zande is also used to refer to related languages in addition to Azande itself, including Adio, Barambu, Apambia, Geme, Kpatiri and Nzakara. Recorded Zande literature is mostly oral, some of it published by missionaries in the early 20th century, and some of it translated in the 1960s.

==Visual culture and music==
As in other African societies, applied arts, artifacts, music and oral literature are key elements of Zande culture. They are most famously known for their throwing knives, called the &quot;shongo&quot;. These show the skill of Zande metal workers with their curved and multi-bladed features. Their visual art includes sculptures made from wood or clay. Many of these represent important animals or ancestors. Zande also have created drums and thumb pianos, called sansa, that sometimes looked like people, animals, and abstract figures. These instruments were used at celebrations like marriages and community dances.

==Traditional beliefs and practices==
===Religion===
Most Azande formerly practiced a traditional African religion, but this has been supplanted to a large extent by Christianity. Their traditional religion involves belief in Mbori, an omnipotent god. They practice magic, oracles, and witchcraft in order to solve their everyday problems. However, the late-nineteenth century marked the beginning of many Zande converting to Christianity. 85 percent of Azande consider themselves Christian, while 15 percent follow their traditional religion. More than half of Azande identify as Roman Catholic.

Early missionaries to the Azande found it difficult to draw comparisons between Christian beliefs and the spiritual belief in &quot;Mbori&quot; who created the universe though did not play the role of God in Christianity. Folk stories of &quot;tricksters&quot; have helped establish a basis for social conduct and the consequences of violating social expectations. The Azande trickster, Ture, is representative of poor decisions and rash actions and serves as a deterrent against similar actions in the community.

The Azande use oracles in their religious traditions, with many different oracles serving unique purposes and carrying varying levels of repute within the larger community. The poison oracle in particular carried a reputation as being an important oracle to the Azande as that oracle, reserved exclusively for men, kept oral traditions and stories alive.

===Witchcraft===

Other traditional beliefs include magic and witchcraft. Among the Azande, witchcraft, or &quot;mangu,&quot; is believed to be an inherited black fluid in the belly which leads a fairly autonomous existence, and has power to perform bad magic on one&#x27;s enemies. Since they believed that witchcraft is inherited, an autopsy of an accused witch would also prove that a particular living person, related to the deceased, was or was not a witch. &quot;Mangu&quot; is thought to be passed down from parent to child of the same sex — from father to son or from mother to daughter. Therefore, if a man were to be proven to possess witchcraft substance, this conclusion would extend to that man&#x27;s father, sons, brothers, and so on.

The Azande rarely have a theoretical interest in witchcraft. What is important is whether a person at a particular point in time is acting as a witch toward a specific person. Witches can sometimes be unaware of their powers, and can accidentally strike people to whom the witch wishes no evil. In terms of death, the prince determined the vengeance placed on the witch or the killer. This could be done through physical killing of the witch, compensation, or lethal magic.

Because witchcraft is believed always to be present, there are several rituals connected to protection from and canceling of witchcraft that are performed almost daily. When something out of the ordinary occurs, usually something unfortunate, to an individual, the Azande may blame witchcraft, just as non-Zande people might blame &quot;bad luck&quot;.

Although witchcraft is contained within the physical body, its action is psychic. The psychic aspect of &quot;mangu&quot; is the soul of witchcraft. It usually, but not always, leaves the physical body of the witch at night, when the victim is asleep, and is directed by the witch into the body of the victim. As it moves, it shines with a bright light that can be seen by anyone during the nighttime. However, during the day it can be seen only by religious specialists.

Oracles are a way of determining the source of the suspected witchcraft, and were for a long time the ultimate legal authority and the main determining factor in how one would respond to the threats. The Azande use three different types of oracles. The most powerful oracle is the &quot;benge&quot; poison oracle, which is used solely by men. The decisions of the oracle are always accepted and no one questions it. The less prestigious but more readily available is the termite oracle. Women, men, and children are all allowed to consult this oracle. The least expensive but also least reliable oracle is the rubbing-board oracle. The rubbing board oracle is described in &quot;Culture Sketches&quot; as &quot;a device resembling a Ouija board, made of two small pieces of wood easily carried to be consulted anywhere, and at any time.&quot;

===Relationships between young men===
There was also a social institution similar to pederasty in Ancient Greece. As the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard recorded in the northern Congo, due to the shortage of women in the region, male Zande warriors between 20 and 30 years of age routinely took on young male lovers between the ages of twelve and twenty, who participated in intercrural and anal sex with their older partners while also performing household duties.
Once the younger partner was considered old enough to become a warrior himself, he received weapons and the relationship ended, with the older partner taking a female wife instead of the &quot;boy wife&quot;.
The practice largely died out by the mid-19th century due to increasing European colonial influence in the region, but the elders Evans-Pritchard spoke to were still sufficiently aware of it to give a fairly detailed description.

===Relationships between young women===
During the 1930s Evans-Pritchard recorded information about sexual relationships between women, based on reports from male Azande. According to male Azande, women would take female lovers in order to seek out pleasure and that partners would penetrate each other using bananas or a food item carved into the shape of a phallus. They also reported that the daughter of a ruler may be given a female slave as a sexual partner. Evans-Pritchard also recorded that the male Azande were fearful of women taking on female lovers, as they might view men as unnecessary.

=== Cannibalism ===

Evans-Pritchard concludes that the numerous descriptions of cannibalism attributed to Azande are not entirely unfounded, though not all of them are reliable. He spoke with a number of elderly Azande, who all agreed (though sometimes with &quot;embarrassment&quot;) that cannibalism had been practiced in former times. According to their testimony, the victims were usually killed or captured enemies and executed criminals, though occasionally members of subjected neighboring peoples were killed for consumption, as they were considered outside &quot;the law&quot; and without rights. Except for criminals, clan members were never eaten except in times of severe hunger, when girls were sometimes sacrificed to ensure the survival of the others – with families exchanging their daughters so that nobody had to eat their own child.

Evans-Pritchard found it impossible to determine how common cannibal customs had been in earlier times, but notes that they seem to have been quite rare during the lifetime of his informers – various older men had seen cases, but none described it as a general practice, not even during war campaigns.
He also points out that customs differed and not all Azande clans engaged in cannibalism. The ruling Avongara clan clearly rejected the practice, but many other groups who came under their influence initially seem to have been cannibals, and Evans-Pritchard considers it credible that some of them continued this custom under Avongara rule, though the latter&#x27;s disapproval may have caused it to become rarer.

According to Evans-Pritchard, there is no credible evidence that cannibalism was practiced in order to acquire the properties of an admired foe or for any other &quot;ritual&quot; or &quot;magical&quot; reason. As the only reasons he heard from Azande for eating human flesh were &quot;either hunger, or more often, a taste for it&quot;, he concludes, in agreement with most other reports of the practice, that it &quot;was eaten simply for meat&quot;.

Around 1980, the Italian missionary F. Gero, who had spent nearly 40 years among the Azande, published a book about their former cannibalism.
He too notes that only some Azande clans had eaten people, especially in war or in order to punish criminals.
His informers told him that the flesh of enemies had been eaten not only to celebrate one&#x27;s victory over them, but also because other provisions were often hard to secure during war campaigns and because letting the human flesh behind to rot was considered needless waste.
Captives were either eaten immediately or kept as slaves, but the latter could still be butchered and consumed as punishment, or when provisions got scarce during famines.

Among some clans it was also usual to kill and consume lonely individuals from unrelated neighboring groups (including other Azande clans) if an opportunity to do so arose. Most of the victims were women and children, because they were easier to subdue and because their flesh was considered tastier than that of men.
According to Gero, though the Avongara did not practise cannibalism and disapproved of the custom among other Azande clans, they punished criminals by selling them to neighboring cannibal peoples who then killed and ate them.

<text>Dzogchen ( &#x27;Great Completion&#x27; or &#x27;Great Perfection&#x27;), also known as &quot;atiyoga&quot; (utmost yoga), is a tradition of teachings in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism and Bön aimed at discovering and continuing in the ultimate ground of existence. The goal of Dzogchen is the direct experience of this basis, called (Sanskrit: ). There are spiritual practices taught in various Dzogchen systems for discovering .

Dzogchen emerged during the first dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet, around the 7th to 9th centuries CE. While it is considered a Tibetan development by some scholars, it draws upon key ideas from Indian sources. The earliest Dzogchen texts appeared in the 9th century, attributed to Indian masters. These texts, known as the Eighteen Great Scriptures, form the &quot;Mind Series&quot; and are attributed to figures like Śrī Siṅgha and Vimalamitra. Early Dzogchen was marked by a departure from normative Vajrayāna practices, focusing instead on simple calming contemplations leading to a direct immersion in awareness. During the Tibetan renaissance era (10th to early 12th century), Dzogchen underwent significant development, incorporating new practices and teachings from India. This period saw the emergence of new Dzogchen traditions like the &quot;Instruction Class series&quot; and the &quot;Seminal Heart&quot; ().

Dzogchen is classified into three series: the Semdé (Mind Series, ), Longdé (Space Series, ), and Menngaggidé (Instruction Series, ). The Dzogchen path comprises the Base, the Path, and the Fruit. The Base represents the original state of existence, characterized by emptiness (&quot;stong pa nyid&quot;), clarity (&quot;lhun grub&quot;, associated with luminous clarity), and compassionate energy (&quot;snying rje&quot;). The Path involves gaining a direct understanding of the mind&#x27;s pure nature through meditation and specific Dzogchen methods. The Fruit is the realization of one&#x27;s true nature, leading to complete non-dual awareness and the dissolution of dualities.

Dzogchen practitioners aim for self-liberation (), where all experiences are integrated with awareness of one&#x27;s true nature. This process may culminate in the attainment of a rainbow body at the moment of death, symbolizing full Buddhahood. Critics point to tensions between gradual and simultaneous practice within Dzogchen traditions, but practitioners argue these approaches cater to different levels of ability and understanding. Overall, Dzogchen offers a direct path to realizing the innate wisdom and compassion of the mind.

== History ==

Dzogchen arose in the era of the first dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet (7th to 9th centuries CE) during the Tibetan Empire and continued during the Era of Fragmentation (9th to 11th centuries). American Tibetologist David Germano argues that Dzogchen is likely a Tibetan Buddhist development. However, numerous ideas key to Dzogchen (like emptiness and luminosity) can be found in Indian sources, like the Buddhist tantras, buddha-nature literature and other Mahāyāna sources like the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;. Furthermore, scholars like Sam van Schaik see Dzogchen as having arisen out of tantric Buddhist completion stage practices.

The earliest Dzogchen sources appeared in the first half of the 9th century, with a series of short texts attributed to Indian saints. The most of important of these are the &quot;Eighteen Great Scriptures&quot;, which are today known as the &quot;Mind Series&quot; (&quot;Semdé&quot;) and are attributed to Indian masters like Śrī Siṅgha, Vairotsana and Vimalamitra&quot;.&quot; The later Semdé compilation tantra titled the &quot;All-Creating King (Kunjed Gyalpo, kun byed rgyal po)&quot; is one of the most important and widely quoted of all Dzogchen scriptures.

Germano sees the early Dzogchen of the Tibetan Empire period as characterized by the rejection of normative Vajrayana practice. Germano calls the early Dzogchen traditions &quot;pristine Great Perfection&quot; since it is marked &quot;by the absence of presentations of detailed ritual and contemplative technique&quot; as well as a lack of funerary, charnel ground and death imagery found in some Buddhist tantras. According to Germano, instead of tantric deity yoga methods, early Dzogchen mainly focused on simple calming (śamatha) contemplations leading to a &quot;technique free immersion in the bare immediacy of one&#x27;s own deepest levels of awareness&quot;. Similarly, Christopher Hatchell explains that since for early Dzogchen &quot;all beings and all appearances are themselves the singular enlightened gnosis of the buddha All Good (Samantabhadra, &quot;Kuntu Zangpo&quot;)&quot;, there is nothing to do but to recognize this inherent awakened mind, relax and let go.

During the Tibetan renaissance era (10th century to the early 12th century) many new Vajrayāna texts, teachings and practices were introduced from India. At this time, the Nyingma school and its Dzogchen traditions reinvented themselves, producing many new scriptures and developing new practices influenced by the Sarma traditions. These new influences were absorbed into Dzogchen through the practice of finding treasure texts (&quot;terma&quot;) that were discovered by &quot;treasure revealers&quot; (&quot;tertons&quot;). These tantric elements included subtle body practices, visionary practices like dark retreat, and a focus on death-motifs and practices (such as funerary and relic rituals, bardo teachings, phowa, etc).

These new methods and teachings were part of several new traditions such as the &quot;Secret Cycle&quot; (&quot;gsang skor&quot;), &quot;Ultra Pith&quot; (&quot;yang tig&quot;), &quot;Brahmin&#x27;s tradition&quot; (&quot;bram ze&#x27;i lugs&quot;), the &quot;Space Class Series,&quot; and especially the &quot;Instruction Class series&quot; (&quot;Menngagde&quot;), which culminated in the &quot;Seminal Heart&quot; (&quot;snying thig&quot;), which emerged in the late 11th and early 12th century. The most influential texts in this period are Seventeen Tantras (&quot;rgyud bcu bdun&quot;). The most important scholarly figure in the systematization of these new traditions was Longchenpa Rabjampa (1308–1364).

Later figures who also revealed important treasure text cycles include Karma Lingpa, (1326–1386, who revealed the &quot;bar-do thos-grol&quot;), Rigdzin Gödem (1337–1409), Jigme Lingpa (1730–1798), who revealed the influential &quot;Longchen Nyingthig&quot; and Dudjom Lingpa (1835–1904).

==Etymology and concepts==
&quot;Dzogchen&quot; is composed of two terms:
* &quot;rdzogs&quot; – perfection, completion
* &quot;chen&quot; – great

According to the fourteenth Dalai Lama, the term &quot;dzogchen&quot; may be a rendering of the Sanskrit term &quot;mahāsandhi&quot;.

The term initially referred to the &quot;highest perfection&quot; of Vajrayāna deity yoga. Specifically, it refers to the stage after the deity visualisation has been dissolved and one rests in the natural state of the innately luminous and pure mind. According to Sam van Schaik, in the 8th-century tantra &quot;Sarvabuddhasamāyoga,&quot; the term refers to &quot;a realization of the nature of reality&quot; which arises through the practice of tantric anuyoga practices which produce bliss.
In the 10th and 11th centuries, when &quot;Dzogchen&quot; emerged as a separate vehicle to liberation in the Nyingma tradition, the term was used synonymously with the Sanskrit term &quot;ati yoga&quot; (primordial yoga).

===&quot;Rigpa&quot; (knowledge) and &quot;ma rigpa&quot; (delusion)===
&quot;Rigpa&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;vidyā&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;) is a central concept in Dzogchen. According to Ācārya Malcolm Smith:

&quot;Ma rigpa&quot; (&quot;avidyā&quot;) is the opposite of &quot;rigpa&quot; or knowledge. &quot;Ma rigpa&quot; is ignorance, delusion, or unawareness, the failure to recognize the nature of the basis. An important theme in Dzogchen texts is explaining how ignorance arises from the basis or dharmatā, which is associated with &quot;ye shes&quot; or pristine consciousness. Automatically arising unawareness (&quot;lhan skyes ma rig pa&quot;) exists because the basis has a natural cognitive potentiality which gives rise to appearances. This is the ground for saṁsāra and nirvāṇa.

=== Traditional exegesis ===
&quot;The Mirror of the Heart of Vajrasattva&quot; (&quot;Dorje Sempa Nyinggi Melong&quot;, &quot;rdo rje sems dpa&#x27; snying gi me long&quot;), a major Dzogchen tantra, explains the term &quot;Dzog&quot; (Perfection) as follows:

&quot;The Mirror of the Heart of Vajrasattva&quot; explains that Dzogchen is &quot;great&quot; because:

* It is the pinnacle of all vehicles, views, meditations, behaviors, goals.
* It is &quot;never moving from the natural state.&quot;
* It functions &quot;without obstacles in the realm beyond change.&quot;
* It manifests &quot;beyond concepts in the realm beyond attachment.&quot;
* It manifests &quot;without attachment in the realm beyond desire&quot;
* It manifests &quot;in great bliss in the realm beyond speech.&quot;
* It is &quot;the source that pervades pure enlightenment.&quot;
* It is &quot;non-substantial &quot;rigpa&quot; beyond action and effort.&quot;
* It remains &quot;in equality without moving from the realm of total bliss&quot; and &quot;without moving from the essential meaning.&quot;
* It exists &quot;everywhere without being a dimension of grasping.&quot;
* It is &quot;the essence of everything without being established with words and syllables.&quot;

==Three series==
The Three Series of Dzogchen () are a traditional Tibetan Buddhist classification which divides the teachings of the Nyingma school&#x27;s Dzogchen tradition into three series, divisions or sections. These three are: the &quot;Semde&quot; (&#x27;Mind Series&#x27;), the &quot;Longdé&quot; (&#x27;Space Series&#x27;) and the &quot;Menngagde&quot; (&#x27;Instruction Series&#x27;). Traditional accounts of the Nyingma school attribute this schema to the Indian master Mañjuśrīmitra (c. 8th century).

According to modern Tibetologists, this doxographic schema actually developed in the literature of the Instruction Series (c. 11th century onwards) as a way to distinguish and categorize the various Dzogchen teachings at the time. According to Instruction Series texts, the Mind Series is based on understanding that one&#x27;s own mind is the basis of all appearances and that this basis, called mind itself, is empty and luminous. The Space series meanwhile is focused on emptiness (Skt. &quot;śūnyatā,&quot; T. &quot;stong-pa nyid&quot;). Finally, the Instruction Series itself is seen as the most direct kind of realization, without the need to meditate on emptiness or mind. Over time, the Instruction Series came to dominate the Dzogchen tradition and it remains the series that is most widely practiced and taught while the other two series are rarely practiced today (with the exception of a few masters like Namkhai Norbu).

According to Namkhai Norbu, the three series are three modes of presenting and introducing the state of Dzogchen. Norbu states that Mennagde is a more direct form of introduction, Longde is closely associated with symbolic forms of introducing Dzogchen and Semde is more focused on oral forms of introduction. Germano writes that the Mind Series serves as a classification for the earlier texts and forms of Dzogchen &quot;prior to the development of the Seminal Heart movements&quot; which focused on meditations based on tantric understandings of bodhicitta (&quot;byang chub kyi sems&quot;). This referred to the ultimate nature of the mind, which is empty (&quot;stong pa&quot;), luminous (&quot;&#x27;od gsal ba&quot;), and pure. According to Germano, the Space and Instruction Series are associated with later (historical) developments of Dzogchen &quot;which increasingly experimented with re-incorporating tantric contemplative techniques centered on the body and vision, as well as the consequent philosophical shifts his became interwoven with.&quot;

==Base, Path, and Fruit==

In Dzogchen, there are three central aspects: the &quot;Base&quot;, the &quot;Path&quot; and the &quot;Fruit&quot;. The &quot;Base&quot; represents the original, unchanging state of existence, characterized by emptiness, clarity, and compassionate energy.

The &quot;Path&quot; comprises three key elements: view, practice, and conduct. The view focuses on gaining a direct understanding of the pure nature of the mind. Practice involves meditation techniques and specific Dzogchen methods. Conduct means integrating these practices into daily life.

The &quot;Fruit&quot; represents the ultimate goal – realizing one&#x27;s true nature and achieving Buddhahood. This involves discovering the inherent state of the base and integrating all experiences with one&#x27;s awareness of it. Ultimately, it leads to complete non-dual awareness, transcending egoic limitations, and dissolving dualities.

=== The Base or Ground ===

A key concept in Dzogchen is the &quot;base&quot;, &quot;ground&quot;, or &quot;primordial state&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;gzhi&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;āśraya&quot;), also called the general ground (&quot;spyi gzhi&quot;) or the original ground (&quot;gdod ma&#x27;i gzhi&quot;). The basis is the original state &quot;before realization produced &quot;buddha&quot;s and nonrealization produced sentient beings&quot;. It is atemporal and unchanging and yet it is &quot;noetically potent&quot;, giving rise to mind (&quot;sems,&quot; Skt. &quot;citta&quot;), consciousness (&quot;shes pa,&quot; Skt. &quot;vijñāna&quot;), delusion (&quot;ma rig pa,&quot; Skt. &quot;avidyā&quot;) and knowledge (&quot;rigpa&quot;, Skt. &quot;vidyā&quot;). Furthermore, Hatchell notes that the Dzogchen tradition portrays ultimate reality as something which is &quot;beyond the concepts of one and many.&quot;

====Three qualities====
According to the Dzogchen-teachings, the &quot;Ground&quot; or Buddha-nature has three qualities:
* &quot;ngo bo&quot;, &quot;essence&quot;, oneness or emptiness (), 
* &quot;rang bzhin&quot;, &quot;nature&quot;, luminosity, lucidity or clarity (as in the luminous mind of the Five Pure Lights) (),
* &quot;thugs rje&quot;, &quot;power&quot;, universal compassionate energy (), unobstructed ().

Herbert V. Guenther points out that this &quot;Ground&quot; is both a static potential and a dynamic unfolding. They give a process-orientated translation, to avoid any essentialist associations, since
The 19th–20th-century Tibetan Buddhist scholar, Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal, sees the Buddha-nature as ultimate truth, nirvana, which is constituted of profundity, primordial peace and radiance:
==== Direct introduction ====

Direct introduction is called the &quot;Empowerment of Awareness&quot; (, pronounced &quot;rigpay sall wahng&quot;), a technical term employed within the Dzogchen lineages for a particular lineage of empowerment propagated by Jigme Lingpa. This empowerment consists of the direct introduction of the student to the intrinsic nature of their own mind-essence, rigpa, by their empowering master.

==== Pointing-out instruction ====

In Dzogchen tradition, pointing-out instruction () is also referred to as &quot;pointing out the nature of mind&quot; (), &quot;pointing out transmission&quot;, or &quot;introduction to the nature of mind&quot;. The pointing-out instruction (&quot;ngo sprod&quot;) is an introduction to the nature of mind.

===The Path===
There are three major divisions of the Dzogchen path, known as the &quot;Three Dharmas of the Path.&quot; These are &quot;tawa&quot;, &quot;gompa&quot;, and &quot;chöpa&quot;. Namkhai Norbu translates these three terms as &#x27;view,&#x27; &#x27;practice,&#x27; and &#x27;conduct.&#x27;

====Garab Dorje&#x27;s three statements====

Garab Dorje (c. 665) epitomized the Dzogchen teaching in three principles, known as &quot;Striking the Vital Point in Three Statements&quot; (&quot;Tsik Sum Né Dek&quot;), said to be his last words. They give in short the development a student has to undergo:

Garab Dorje&#x27;s three statements were integrated into the &quot;Nyingthig&quot; traditions, the most popular of which in the &quot;Longchen Nyingthig&quot; by Jigme Lingpa (1730–1798). The statements are:

# Introducing directly the face of rigpa itself (&quot;ngo rang tok tu tré&quot;). Dudjom Rinpoche states this refers to: &quot;Introducing directly the face of the naked mind as the rigpa itself, the innate primordial wisdom.&quot;
# Deciding upon one thing and one thing only (&quot;tak chik tok tu ché&quot;). Dudjom states: &quot;Because all phenomena, whatever manifests, whether saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, are none other than the rigpa’s own play, there is complete and direct decision that there is nothing other than the abiding of the continual flow of rigpa.&quot;
# Confidence directly in the liberation of rising thoughts (&quot;deng drol tok tu cha&quot;). Dudjom comments: &quot;In the recognition of &quot;namtok&quot; [arising thoughts], whatever arises, whether gross or subtle, there is direct confidence in the simultaneity of the arising and dissolution in the expanse of dharmakāya, which is the unity of rigpa and &quot;śūnyatā&quot;.&quot;

====View====

Nyingma Dzogchen texts use unique terminology to describe the Dzogchen view (Tib. &quot;tawa&quot;). Some of these terms deal with the different elements and features of the mind and are drawn from classic Buddhist thought. The generic term for consciousness is &quot;shes pa&quot; (&quot;Skt. vijñāna&quot;), and includes the six sense consciousnesses. Worldly, impure and dualistic forms of consciousness are generally referred to with terms such as &quot;sems&quot; (&quot;citta,&quot; mind), &quot;yid&quot; (&quot;mānas&quot;) and &quot;blo&quot; (&quot;buddhi&quot;). On the other hand, nirvanic or liberated forms of consciousness are described with terms such as &quot;ye shes&quot; (&quot;jñāna&quot;, &#x27;pristine consciousness&#x27;) and &quot;shes rab&quot; (&quot;prajñā&quot;, wisdom). According to Sam van Schaik, two significant terms used in Dzogchen literature is the ground (&quot;gzhi&quot;) and gnosis (&quot;rig pa&quot;), which represent the &quot;ontological and gnoseological aspects of the nirvanic state&quot; respectively.

Nyingma Dzogchen literature also describes nirvana as the &quot;expanse&quot; or &quot;space&quot; (&quot;klong&quot; or &quot;dbyings&quot;) or the &quot;expanse of Dharma&quot; (&quot;chos dbyings&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;Dharmadhatu&quot;). The term &quot;Dharmakaya&quot; (Dharma body) is also often associated with these terms in Dzogchen, as explained by Tulku Urgyen:

The Dzogchen View of the secret instruction series (&quot;man ngag sde&quot;) is classically explained through the eleven vajra topics. These can be found in the &quot;String of Pearls Tantra&quot; (&quot;Mu tig phreng ba&quot;), the &quot;Great Commentary by Vimalamitra&quot; as well as in Longchenpa&#x27;s &quot;Treasury of Word and Meaning&quot; (&quot;Tsik Dön Dzö).&quot;

==== Practice ====

Dzogchen practice (&quot;gompa&quot;) relies on the Dzogchen view which is a &quot;direct, non-dual, non-conceptual knowledge&quot; of the pure nature. This is achieved through one&#x27;s relationship with a guru or lama who introduces one to our own primordial state and provides instruction on how to practice. This &quot;direct introduction&quot; and transmission from a Dzogchen master is considered absolutely essential.

The Dzogchen tradition contains numerous systems of practices, including various forms of meditation, tantric yogas and unique Dzogchen methods. The earliest form of Dzogchen practice (the &quot;Semde&quot;, &quot;Mind&quot; series) generally emphasized non-symbolic &quot;formless&quot; practices (as opposed to tantric deity yoga).

Later developments led to the main Dzogchen practices becoming more infused with various preliminary and tantric methods like deity yoga, semdzin (holding the mind), rushen (separating samsara and nirvana), and &quot;vipasyana&quot; (&quot;lhagthong&quot;), which are all seen as skillful means to achieve the basic state of contemplation of the primordially pure state.

The key Dzogchen meditation methods, which are unique to the tradition are &quot;trekchö&quot; (&quot;cutting tension&quot;) and &quot;tögal&quot;, along with unique Dzogchen teachings on awakening in the &quot;bardo&quot; (intermediate state between death and rebirth). In &quot;trekchö,&quot; one first identifies the innate pure awareness, and then sustains recognition of it in all activities. In &quot;tögal&quot; (&quot;crossing over&quot;), a yogi works with various gazes and postures which lead to various forms of visions (in dark retreat or through sky gazing).

The most comprehensive study of sky-gazing meditation, known as &quot;tögal&quot; or &quot;thod rgal&quot;, has been written by Flavio A. Geisshuesler. Although the term &quot;thod rgal&quot; is generally translated as &quot;Direct Transcendence&quot; or &quot;Leap Over,&quot; Geisshuesler argues that the expression really means &quot;Skullward Leap&quot; as it consists of the Tibetan words &quot;thod&quot; (&quot;above,&quot; &quot;over,&quot; but also &quot;head wrapper,&quot; &quot;turban,&quot; &quot;skull&quot;) and &quot;rgal&quot; (&quot;to leap over&quot;). In the larger Tibetan cultural area, it is the most elevated part of the human body—the skull or, its extension in the form of a turban-like headdress—that allows the religious practitioner to gain access to the source of vitality located in the heavens. Both the head and the headdress have deep resonances with animals—particularly deer and sheep—which are central for the sky-gazing practice because of their ability to ascend and descend vertically to move in between various realms of existence.

====Conduct====

Norbu notes that &quot;Tantric practices may be used as secondary practices by the practitioner of Dzogchen, alongside the principal practice of contemplation.&quot; Similarly, physical yoga (Tib. &quot;trulkhor&quot;) may also be used as supporting practices.
=== The Fruit ===
====Self-liberation====
According to Namkhai Norbu, in Dzogchen, &quot;to become realized simply means to discover and manifest that which from the very beginning has been our own true condition: the Zhi (gzhi) or Base.&quot; Since the basis, the path of practice and the fruit or result of practice are non-dual from the ultimate perspective, in Dzogchen understands the path as not separate from the result or fruit of the path (i.e. Buddhahood). Once a Dzogchen practitioner has recognized their true nature (and &quot;do not remain in doubt&quot; regarding this), the path consists of the integration (&quot;sewa&quot;) of all experiences in their life with the state of rigpa. All these experiences are self-liberated through this integration or mixing.

This process is often explained through three &quot;liberations&quot; or capacities of a Dzogchen practitioner:
*Cherdrol (&quot;one observes and it liberates&quot;) - This is when an ordinary appearance occurs and one sees its true nature, which leads to its self-liberation. It is compared to how a drop of dew evaporates when the sunlight shines on it.
*Shardrol (&quot;as soon as it arises it liberates itself&quot;) - This occurs when any sense contact or passion arises self-liberates automatically and effortlessly. This is compared to how snow melts immediately on falling into the sea.
*Rangdrol (&quot;of itself it liberates itself&quot;), according to Norbu, this is &quot;completely non-dual and all-at-once, instantaneous self-liberation. Here the illusory separation of subject and object collapses of itself, and one&#x27;s habitual vision, the limited cage, the trap of ego, opens out into the spacious vision of what is&quot;. The simile used here is a snake effortlessly unwinding its own body.

Advanced Dzogchen practitioners are also said to sometimes manifest supranormal knowledge (Skt. &quot;abhijñā,&quot; Tib. &quot;mngon shes&quot;), such as clairvoyance and telepathy.

==== Rainbow body ====

&quot;Tögal&quot; practice may lead to full Buddhahood and the self-liberation of the human body into a rainbow body at the moment of death, when all fixation and grasping has been exhausted. Tibetan Buddhism holds that the rainbow body is a nonmaterial body of light with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one&#x27;s compassion. It is a manifestation of the sambhogakāya and its attainment is said to be accompanied by the appearance of lights and rainbows.

Some exceptional practitioners are held to have realized a higher type of rainbow body without dying (these include the 24 Bön masters from the oral tradition of Zhang Zhung, Tapihritsa, Padmasambhava, and Vimalamitra). Having completed the four visions before death, the individual focuses on the lights that surround the fingers. His or her physical body self-liberates into a nonmaterial body of light with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one&#x27;s compassion.

==Critique==
=== Simultaneous and gradual practice ===
As noted by van Schaik, there is a tension in the Longchen Nyingtik tradition of Dzogchen between methods which emphasize gradual practice and attainments, and methods which emphasize primordial liberation, simultaneous enlightenment, and non-activity. This seeming contradiction is explained by authors of the tradition as being related to the different levels of ability of different practitioners.

For example, the works of Jigme Lingpa contain criticisms of methods which rely on cause and effect as well as methods that rely on intellectual analysis. Since Buddhahood is uncaused and transcendent of the intellect, these contrived and conceptual meditations are contrasted with &quot;effortless&quot; and &quot;instantaneous&quot; approaches in the works of Jigme Lingpa, who writes that as soon as a thought arises, it is to be seen nakedly, without analysis or examination. Similarly, a common theme of Dzogchen literature is the elevation of Dzogchen above all other &quot;lower&quot; (&quot;&#x27;og ma&quot;) vehicles and a criticism of these lower vehicles which are seen as inferior (&quot;dman pa&quot;) approaches.

In spite of these critiques, Dzogchen cycles like Jigme Lingpa&#x27;s &quot;Longchen Nyingthig&quot; do contain numerous practices which are not instantaneous or effortless, such as tantric Mahayoga practice like deity yoga and preliminary methods such as ngondro (which are equated with the path of accumulation). Furthermore, Jigme Lingpa and Longchenpa also criticize those who teach the simultaneous method to everyone and teach them to dispense with all other methods at once.

In response to the idea that the gradualist teachings found in the Longchen Nyingtik texts contradict the Dzogchen view of primordial liberation, Jigme Lingpa states:

This division of practices according to level of ability is also found in Longchenpa&#x27;s &quot;Tegchö Dzö.&quot; However, as van Schaik notes, &quot;the system should not be taken too literally. It is likely that all three types of instruction contained in the threefold structure of YL [&quot;Yeshe Lama&quot;] would be given to any one person.&quot; Therefore, though the instructions would be given to all student types, the actual capacity of the practitioner would determine how they would attain awakening (through Dzogchen meditation, in the bardo of death, or through transference of consciousness). Jigme Lingpa also believed that students of the superior faculties were extremely rare. He held that for most people, a gradual path of training is what is needed to reach realization.

<text>Padmasambhava (&quot;Born from a Lotus&quot;), also known as Guru Rinpoche (Precious Guru), was a semi-legendary tantric Buddhist Vajra master from India who fully revealed the Vajrayana in Tibet, circa 8th – 9th centuries. He is considered an emanation or Nirmāṇakāya of Shakyamuni Buddha as foretold by the Buddha himself. According to early Tibetan sources including the &quot;Testament of Ba&quot;, he came to Tibet in the 8th century and designed Samye Monastery, the first Buddhist monastery in Tibet during the reign of King Trisong Detsen. He, the king, and Khenpo Shantarakshita are also responsible for creating the Tibetan Canon through translating all of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings and their commentaries into the Tibetan language.

According to Lewis Doney, while his historical authenticity was questioned by earlier Tibetologists, it is now &quot;cautiously accepted.” Padmasambhava himself was recorded as saying he was an historical person, and his footprints left in rocks are evidence. Padmasambhava later came to be viewed as a central figure in the transmission of Buddhism to Tibet. Starting from around the 12th century, hagiographies concerning Padmasambhava were written. These works expanded the profile and activities of Padmasambhava, now seen as taming all the Tibetan spirits and gods, and concealing various secret texts (&quot;terma&quot;) for future tertöns. Nyangral Nyima Özer (1124–1192) was the author of the &quot;Zangling-ma&quot; (Jeweled Rosary), the earliest biography of Padmasambhava. He has been called &quot;one of the main architects of the Padmasambhava mythos – who first linked Padmasambhava to the Great Perfection in a high-profile manner.&quot;

In modern Tibetan Buddhism, Padmasambhava is considered to be a Buddha that was foretold by Buddha Shakyamuni. According to traditional hagiographies, his students include the great female masters Yeshe Tsogyal and Mandarava. The contemporary Nyingma school considers Padmasambhava to be a founding figure. The Nyingma school also traditionally holds that its Dzogchen lineage has its origins in Garab Dorje through a lineage of transmission to Padmasambhava.

In Tibetan Buddhism, the teachings of Padmasambava are said to include an oral lineage (&quot;kama&quot;), and a lineage of the hidden treasure texts (&quot;termas&quot;). Tibetan Buddhism holds that Padmasambhava&#x27;s termas are discovered by fortunate beings and tertöns (treasure finders) when conditions are ripe for their reception. Padmasambhava is said to appear to tertöns in visionary encounters, and his form is visualized during guru yoga practice, particularly in the Nyingma school. Padmasambhava is widely venerated by Buddhists in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, the Himalayan states of India, and in countries around the world.

== History ==

=== Early sources ===

One of the earliest chronicle sources for Padmasambhava as a historical figure is the &quot;Testament of Ba&quot; (&quot;Dba&#x27; bzhed&quot;, c. 9th–12th centuries), which records the founding of Samye Monastery under the reign of King Trisong Detsen (r. 755–797/804). Other early manuscripts from Dunhuang also mention a tantric master associated with kilaya rituals named Padmasambhava who tames demons, though they do not associate this figure with Trisong Detsen.

According to the &quot;Testament of Ba&quot;, Trisong Detsen had invited the Buddhist abbot and Indian philosopher Śāntarakṣita (725–788) to Tibet to propagate Buddhism and help found the first Buddhist monastery at Samye (&#x27;The Inconceivable&#x27;). However, certain events like the flooding of a Buddhist temple and lightning striking the royal palace had caused some at the Tibetan court to believe that the local gods were angry.

Śāntarakṣita was sent to Nepal, but was then asked to return after the anti-Buddhist sentiments had subsided. On his return, Śāntarakṣita brought Padmasambhava who was an Indian tantric adept from Oddiyana. Padmasambhava&#x27;s task was to tame the local spirits and impress the Tibetans with his magical and ritual powers. The Tibetan sources then explain how Padmasambhava identified the local gods and spirits, called them out and threatened them with his powers. After they had been tamed, the construction of Samye went ahead. Padmasambhava was also said to have taught various forms of tantric Buddhist yoga.

When the royal court began to suspect that Padmasambhava wanted to seize power, he was asked to leave by the king. The Testament of Ba also mentions other miracles by Padmasambhava, mostly associated with the taming of demons and spirits as well as longevity rituals and water magic.

Evidence shows that Padmasambhava&#x27;s tantric teachings were being taught in Tibet during the 10th century. Recent evidence suggests that Padmasambhava already figured in spiritual hagiography and ritual, and was already seen as the enlightened source of tantric scriptures up to 200 years before Nyangrel Nyima Özer (1136–1204), the primary source of the traditional hagiography of Padmasambhava.

Lewis Doney notes that while numerous texts are associated with Padmasambhava, the most likely of these attributions are the &quot;Man ngag lta ba&#x27;i phreng ba&quot; (&quot;The Garland of Views&quot;)&quot;,&quot; a commentary on the 13th chapter of the &quot;Guhyagarbha tantra&quot; and the &quot;Thabs zhags padma &#x27;phreng&quot; (&quot;A Noble Noose of Methods, The Lotus Garland&quot;)&quot;,&quot; an exposition of Mahayoga. The former work is mentioned in the work of Nubchen Sangye Yeshe (c. 9–10th centuries) and attributed to Padmasambhava.

=== Development of the mythos ===

While in the eleventh and twelfth centuries there were several parallel narratives of important founding figures like Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, Songtsän Gampo, and Vairotsana, by the end of the 12th century, the Padmasambhava narrative grew to dominate the others, becoming the most influential legend of the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet.

The first full biography of Padmasambhava is a terma (treasure text) said to have been revealed by Nyangrel Nyima Özer, abbot of Mawochok Monastery. This biography, &quot;The Copper Palace (bka&#x27; thang zangs gling ma),&quot; was very influential on the Padmasambhava hagiographical tradition. The narrative was also incorporated into Nyima Özer&#x27;s history of Buddhism, the &quot;Flower Nectar: The Essence of Honey (chos &#x27;byung me tog snying po sbrang rtsi&#x27;i bcud)&quot;.

The tertön Guru Chöwang (1212–1270) was the next major contributor to the Padmasambhava tradition, and may have been the first full life-story biographer of Yeshe Tsogyal.

The basic narrative of &quot;The Copper Palace&quot; continued to be expanded and edited by Tibetans. In the 14th century, the Padmasambhava hagiography was further expanded and re-envisioned through the efforts of the Orgyen Lingpa (1323 – c. 1360). It is in the works of Orgyen Lingpa, particularly his &quot;Padma bka&#x27; thang&quot; (Lotus Testament, 1352), that the &quot;11 deeds&quot; of Padmasambhava first appear in full. The &quot;Lotus Testament&quot; is a very extensive biography of Padmasambhava, which begins with his ordination under Ananda and contains numerous references to Padmasambhava as a &quot;second Buddha.&quot;

== Hagiography ==

According to Khenchen Palden Sherab, there are traditionally said to be nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine biographies of Padmasambhava. They are categorized in three ways: Those relating to Padmasambhava&#x27;s Dharmakaya buddhahood, those accounts of his Sambhogakaya nature, and those chronicles of his Nirmanakaya activities.

=== Birth and early life ===
Hagiographies of Padmasambhava such as &quot;The Copper Palace,&quot; depict Padmasambhava being born as an eight-year-old child appearing in a lotus blossom floating in Lake Dhanakosha surrounded by a host of dakinis, in the kingdom of Oddiyana.

However there are other birth stories as well, another common one states that he was born from the womb of Queen Jalendra, the wife of king Sakra of Oddiyana and received the name Dorje Duddul (Vajra Demon Subjugator) because of the auspicious marks on his body were identified as those of a demon tamer.

As Nyingma scholar Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche explains: 

In &quot;The Copper Palace,&quot; King Indrabhuti of Oddiyana is searching for a wish fulfilling jewel and finds Padmasambhava, who is said to be an incarnation of Buddha Amitabha. The king adopts him as his own son and Padmasambhava is enthroned as the Lotus King (&quot;Pema Gyalpo&quot;). However, Padmasambhava&#x27;s khaṭvāṅga staff falls on one of Indrabhuti&#x27;s ministers, killing him, and Padmasambhava is exiled from the kingdom, which allows him to live as a mahasiddha and practice tantra in charnel grounds throughout India.

In Himachal Pradesh, India at Rewalsar Lake, known as Tso Pema in Tibetan, Padmasambhava secretly gave tantric teachings to princess Mandarava, the local king&#x27;s daughter. The king found out and tried to burn both him and his daughter, but it is said that when the smoke cleared they were still alive and in meditation, centered in a lotus arising from a lake. Greatly astonished by this miracle, the king offered Padmasambhava both his kingdom and Mandarava.

Padmasambhava is then said to have returned home with Mandarava and together they converted the kingdom to Vajrayana Buddhism.

=== Nepal ===
Padmasambhava and Mandarava are also said to have travelled together to the Maratika Cave in eastern Nepal to practice long life rituals of Amitāyus. It was the place where, after the penance, they achieved the blessing of immortality from lord Amitāyus, the Buddha of long life. In the village of Pharping, located on the southern edge of Kathmandu district, the Guru is said to have done long penance combining the practices of Yangdak Heruka and Vajrakilaya, and attained the ultimate Mahamudra (or &quot;the Great Seal&quot;). 
The Tibetan Buddhism also mentions that Guru Rinpoche meditated at Muktinath (lord of liberation) temple in western Nepal before departing for Tibet. The nuns residing in the temple complex of Muktinath are revered as female goddesses and offspring of the females who were taught and initiated by Padmasambhava. A statue of Padmasambhava, which is believed to have built by him in his own image, currently resides in the Mharme Lhakhang Gompa and is taken care of by these nuns. 

=== Tibet ===

Padmasambhava hagiographies also discuss the activities of Padmasambhāva in Tibet, beginning with the invitation by King Trisong Detsen to help in the founding of Samye. Padmasambhava is depicted as a great tantric adept who tames the spirits and demons of Tibet and turns them into guardians for the Buddha&#x27;s Dharma (specifically, the deity Pe har is made the protector of Samye). He is also said to have spread Vajrayana Buddhism to the people of Tibet, and specifically introduced its practice of Tantra.

The subjection of subduing deities and demons is a recurrent theme in Buddhist literature, as noted also in Vajrapani and Mahesvara and Steven Heine&#x27;s &quot;Opening a Mountain&quot;.

Because of his role in the founding of Samye monastery, the first monastery in Tibet, Padmasambhava is regarded as the founder of the Nyingma school (&quot;Ancients&quot;) of Tibetan Buddhism. Padmasambhava&#x27;s activities in the Tibet include the practice of tantric rituals to increase the life of the king as well as initiating king Trisong Detsen into tantric rites.

The various biographies also discuss stories of Padmasambhava&#x27;s main Tibetan consort, princess Yeshe Tsogyal (&quot;Knowledge Lake Empress&quot;), who became his student while living in the court of Trisong Deutsen. She was among Padmasambhava&#x27;s three special students (along with the King, and Namkhai Nyingpo) and is widely revered in Tibet as the &quot;Mother of Buddhism&quot;. Yeshe Tsogyal became a great master with many disciples and is widely considered to be a female Buddha.

Padmasambhava hid numerous termas in Tibet for later discovery with her aid, while she compiled and elicited Padmasambhava&#x27;s teachings through the posing of questions, and then reached Buddhahood in her lifetime. Many thangkas and paintings depict Padmasambhava with consorts at each side, Mandarava on his right and Yeshe Tsogyal on his left.

Many of the Nyingma school&#x27;s terma texts are said to have originated from the activities of Padmasambhava and his students. These hidden treasure texts are believed to be discovered and disseminated when conditions are ripe for their reception. The Nyingma school traces its lineage of Dzogchen teachings to Garab Dorje through Padmasambhava&#x27;s termas.

In &quot;The Copper Palace,&quot; after the death of Trisong Detsen, Padmasambhava is said to have travelled to Lanka in order to convert its blood thirsty raksasa demons to the Dharma. His parting words of advice advocates for the worship of Avalokiteshvara.

According to Tibetan Buddhist legends of the local Monpa tribe, Chumi Gyatse Falls, also known as the &#x27;108 waterfalls&#x27; got created after a mythical showdown between Guru Padmasambhava and a high priest of the Bonpa sect that ruled supreme in Tibet and surrounding areas including Arunachal Pradesh in the pre-Buddhist times. The waterfall was formed when Guru Padmasambhava flung his rosary against a rock and 108 streams gushed out. Chumi Gyatse waterfall is revered and holy for the Monpas, the Tibetan Buddhists.

=== Bhutan ===
Bhutan has many important pilgrimage places associated with Padmasambhava. He visited Bhutan three times. Guru Rimpoche first came to Bhutan in 810 A.D. from Nepal via Nabji Korphu in the Trongsa District. The second and third visits were from Tibet. The most famous site of Guru Rinpoche is Paro Taktsang or &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Nest&quot; monastery which is built on a sheer cliff wall about 900m above the floor of Paro valley. It was built around the &quot;Taktsang Senge Samdup (stag tshang seng ge bsam grub) cave&quot; where Padmasambhava is said to have meditated.

Guru Rinpoche is said to have flown there from Singye Dzong on the back of Monmo Tashi Khyidren, whom he transformed into a flying tigress for the purpose of the trip. Later, he travelled to Bumthang district to subdue a powerful deity, Shelging Karpo who was offended by a local king, Sindhu Raja of the Kingdom of Bumthang. According to legend, Padmasambhava&#x27;s body imprint can be found in the wall of a cave at nearby Kurje Lhakhang temple. 

While in Bumthang, Guru Rinpoche meditated and blessed Tang Rimochen Lhakhang, Thowadrak Monastery, Kunzangdrak Monastery, Zhabjethang Lhakhang, Choedrak Monastery and Shudrak Goenpa. He also hid many treasures in Membartsho, the burning lake in Bumthang.

Guru Rimpoche then traveled to Eastern Bhutan where he blessed Gomphu Kora, Gongza Ney, Dechen Phodrang Ney, and Omba Ney in Trashiyangtse. Guru Rinpoche also blessed Aja Ney in Monggar, and Neychhen Rinchen Bumpa and Singye Dzong in Lhuentse.

== Eight manifestations ==


The eight manifestations are also seen as Padmasambhava&#x27;s biography that spans 1500 years. As Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche states, 

In accord, Rigpa Shedra also states the eight principal forms were assumed by Guru Rinpoche at different points in his life. Padmasambhava&#x27;s eight manifestations, or forms (Tib. &quot;Guru Tsen Gye&quot;), represent different aspects of his being as needed, such as wrathful or peaceful for example.

The eight manifestations of Padmasambhava belong to the tradition of Terma, the Revealed Treasures (Tib.: ter ma), and are described and enumerated as follows:

# Guru Pema Gyalpo (Wylie: &quot;gu ru pad ma rgyal-po&quot;, Skt: &quot;Guru Padmarāja&quot;) of Oddiyana, meaning &quot;Lotus King&quot;, king of the Tripitaka (the Three Collections of Scripture), manifests as a child four years after the Mahaparinirvana of Buddha Shakyamuni, as predicted by the Buddha. He is shown with a reddish pink complexion and semi-wrathful, seated on a lotus and wearing yellow-orange robes, a small damaru in his right hand and a mirror and hook in his left hand, with a top-knot wrapped in white and streaming with red silk.
# Guru Nyima Ozer (Wylie: &quot;gu ru nyi-ma &#x27;od-zer&quot;, Skrt: &quot;Guru Suryabhasa&quot; or &quot;Sūryaraśmi&quot;), meaning &quot;Ray of Sun&quot;, the Sunray Yogi, semi-wrathful, manifests in India simultaneously with Guru Pema Gyalpo, often portrayed as a crazy wisdom wandering yogi, numerous simultaneous emanations, illuminates the darkness of the mind through the insight of Dzogchen. He is shown seated on a lotus with left leg bent and with a golden-red complexion, semi-wrathful with slightly bulging eyes, long hair with bone ornaments, moustache and beard, bare-chested with a tiger-skin skirt, right hand holds a khatvanga and left hand is in a mudra, interacting with the sun.
# Guru Loden Chokse (Wylie: &quot;gu ru blo ldan mchog sred&quot;; Skrt: &quot;Guru Mativat Vararuci&quot;,) meaning roughly &quot;Super Knowledge Holder&quot;, peaceful, manifests after Guru Pema Gyalpo departs Oddiyana for the great charnel grounds of India and for all knowledge, the Intelligent Youth, the one who gathers the knowledge of all worlds. He is shown seated on a lotus, white complexion, wearing a white scarf with ribbons wrapped around his head, and a blue-green lotus decorating his hair, holding a damaru in the right hand and a lotus bowl in the left hand.
# Guru Padmasambhava (Skt: &quot;Guru Padmasambhava&quot;), meaning &quot;Lotus Essence&quot;, a symbol of spiritual perfection, peaceful, manifests and teaches Mandarava, transforming negative energies into compassionate and peaceful forms. He is shown with a rich white complexion, very peaceful, and wears a red monk&#x27;s hat, and sits on a lotus with his right hand in a mudra and left hand holding a skull-cup.
# Guru Shakya Senge (Wylie: &quot;shAkya seng-ge&quot;, Skt: &quot;Guru Śākyasimha&quot;) of Bodh Gaya, meaning &quot;Lion of the Sakyas&quot;, peaceful, manifests as Ananda&#x27;s student and brings King Ashoka to the Dharma, Lion of the Sakyas, embodies patience and detachment, learns all Buddhist canons and Tantric practices of the eight Vidyadharas. He is shown similar to Buddha Shakymuni but with golden skin in red monk&#x27;s robes, a unishaka, a begging bowl in the left hand and a five-pointed vajra in the right hand.
# Guru Senge Dradrog (Wylie: &quot;gu ru seng-ge sgra-sgrogs&quot;, Skt: &quot;Guru Simhanāda&quot;,) meaning &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Roar&quot;, wrathful, subdues and pacifies negative influences, manifests in India and at Nalanda University, the Lion of Debate, promulgator of the Dharma throughout the six realms of sentient beings. He is shown as dark blue and surrounded by flames above a lotus, with fangs and three glaring eyes, crown of skulls and long hair, standing on a demon, holding a flaming vajra in the right hand, left hand in a subjugation mudra.
# Guru Pema Jungne (Wylie: &quot;pad ma &#x27;byung-gnas&quot;, Skt: &quot;Guru Padmakara&quot;), meaning &quot;Born from a Lotus&quot;, manifests before his arrival in Tibet, the Vajrayana Buddha that teaches the Dharma to the people, embodies all manifestations and actions of pacifying, increasing, magnetizing and subjugating. As the most depicted manifestation, he is shown sitting on a lotus, dressed in three robes, under which he wears a blue shirt, pants and Tibetan shoes. He holds a vajra in his right hand, and a skull-bowl with a small vase in his left hand. A special trident called a khatvanga leans on the left shoulder representing Yeshe Tsogyal, and he wears a Nepalese cloth hat in the shape of a lotus flower. Thus he is represented as he must have appeared in Tibet.
# Guru Dorje Drolo (Wylie: &quot;gu ru rDo-rje gro-lod&quot;, Skt: &quot;Guru Vajra&quot;), meaning &quot;Crazy Wisdom&quot;, very wrathful, manifests five years before Guru Pema Jungne departs Tibet, 13 emanations for 13 Tiger&#x27;s Nests caves, the fierce manifestation of Vajrakilaya (wrathful Vajrasattva) known as &quot;Diamond Guts&quot;, the comforter of all, imprinting the elements with Wisdom-Treasure, subduer for degenerate times. He is shown dark red, surrounded by flames, wearing robes and Tibetan shoes, conch earrings, a garland of heads, dancing on a tiger, symbolizing Tashi Kyeden, that is also dancing.

Padmasambhava&#x27;s various Sanskrit names are preserved in mantras such as those found in the &quot;Yang gsang rig &#x27;dzin youngs rdzogs kyi blama guru mtshan brgyad bye brag du sgrub pa ye shes bdud rtsi&#x27;i sbrang char zhe bya ba&quot;.

==Iconography==

Padmasambhava has one face and two hands. He is wrathful and smiling. He blazes magnificently with the splendour of the major and minor marks. His two eyes are wide open in a piercing gaze. He has the youthful appearance of an eight-year-old child. His complexion is white with a tinge of red. He is seated with his two feet in the royal posture.

On his head he wears a five-petalled lotus hat, which has three points symbolizing the three kayas, five colours symbolizing the five kayas, the sun and moon symbolizing skillful means and wisdom, a vajra top to symbolize unshakable samadhi, and a vulture&#x27;s feather to represent the realization of the highest view.

Padmasambhava wears a white vajra undergarment. On top of this, in layers, a red robe, a dark blue mantrayana tunic, a red monastic shawl decorated with a golden flower pattern, and a maroon cloak of silk brocade. Also, he wears a silk cloak, Dharma robes and gown. He is wearing the dark blue gown of a mantra practitioner, the red and yellow shawl of a monk, the maroon cloak of a king, and the red robe and secret white garments of a bodhisattva.

In his right hand, he holds a five-pronged vajra at his heart. His left hand rests in the gesture of equanimity, In his left hand he holds a skull-cup brimming with nectar, containing the vase of longevity that is also filled with the nectar of deathless wisdom and ornamented on top by a wish-fulfilling tree.

Cradled in his left arm he holds the three-pointed khatvanga (trident) symbolizing the Princess consort Mandarava, one of his two main consorts. who arouses the wisdom of bliss and emptiness, concealed as the three-pointed khatvanga. Other sources say that the khatvanga represents the Lady Yeshe Tsogyal, his primary consort and 

main disciple. Its three points represent the essence, nature and compassionate energy (ngowo, rangshyin and tukjé). Below these three prongs are three severed heads, dry, fresh and rotten, symbolizing the dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya. Nine iron rings adorning the prongs represent the nine yanas. Five-coloured strips of silk symbolize the five wisdoms The khatvanga is also adorned with locks of hair from dead and living mamos and dakinis, as a sign that the Master subjugated them all when he practised austerities in the Eight Great Charnel Grounds.

Around him within a lattice of five-coloured light, appear the eight vidyadharas of India, the twenty-five disciples of Tibet, the deities of the three roots, and an ocean of oath-bound protectors

==Attributes==

=== Pureland paradise ===
His pureland paradise is Zangdok Palri (the Copper-Coloured Mountain).

=== Samantabhadra and Samantabhadri ===
Padmasambhava said:
Another translation of Guru Rinpoche&#x27;s statement is:

== Associated practices ==
From the earliest sources to today, Padmasambhava has remained closely associated with the Kila (&quot;phurba&quot;) dagger and also with the deity Vajrakilaya (a meditation deity based on the kila).

===Vajra Guru mantra===

The &quot;Vajra Guru mantra&quot; is:

Like most Sanskrit mantras in Tibet, the Tibetan pronunciation demonstrates dialectic variation and is generally &quot;Om Ah Hung Benza Guru Pema Siddhi Hung&quot;. This mantra does require transmission and it is usually requested that no one shares the mantra, but it can only be read.

In the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, particularly in Nyingma, the Vajra Guru mantra is held to be a powerful mantra engendering with the Three Vajras of Padmasambhava&#x27;s mindstream and by his grace, all enlightened beings. The 14th century tertön Karma Lingpa wrote a famous commentary on the mantra.

According to the great tertön Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, the basic meaning of the mantra is:

=== Seven Line Prayer ===

The Seven Line Prayer to Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche) is a well-known prayer that is recited by many Tibetans daily and is said to contain the most sacred and important teachings of Dzogchen:

Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso composed a famous commentary to the Seven Line Prayer called &quot;White Lotus&quot;. It explains the meaning of the prayer in five levels of meaning intended to catalyze a process of realization. These hidden teachings are described as ripening and deepening, in time, with study and with contemplation. There is also a shorter commentary by Tulku Thondup.

=== Cham dances ===

The life of Padmasambhava is widely depicted in the Cham dances which are masked and costumed dances associated with religious festivals in the Tibetan Buddhist world. In Bhutan, the dances are performed during the annual religious festivals or tshechu.

=== Terma cycles ===
There are numerous Terma cycles which are believed to contain teachings of Padmasambhava. According to Tibetan tradition, the &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot; (commonly referred to as the Tibetan Book of the Dead) was among these hidden treasures, subsequently discovered by a Tibetan tertön, Karma Lingpa (1326–1386).

Tantric cycles related to Padmasambhava are not just practiced by the Nyingma, they even gave rise to a new offshoot of Bön which emerged in the 14th century called the New Bön. Prominent figures of the Sarma (new translation) schools such as the Karmapas and Sakya lineage heads have practiced these cycles and taught them. Some of the greatest scholars who revealed teachings related to Padmasambhava have been from the Kagyu or Sakya lineages. The hidden lake temple of the Dalai Lamas behind the Potala Palace, called Lukhang, is dedicated to Dzogchen teachings and has murals depicting the eight manifestations of Padmasambhava.

== Five main consorts ==
Many of the students gathered around Padmasambhava became advanced Vajrayana tantric practitioners, and became enlightened. They also founded and propagated the Nyingma school. The most prominent of these include Padmasambhava&#x27;s five main female consorts, often referred to as wisdom dakinis, and his twenty five main students along with king Trisong Detsen.

Padmasambhava had five main female tantric consorts, beginning in India before his time in Tibet and then in Tibet as well. When seen from an outer, or perhaps even historical or mythological perspective, these five women from across South Asia were known as the &quot;Five Consorts.&quot; That the women come from very different geographic regions is understood as a mandala, a support for Padmasambhava in spreading the dharma throughout the region.

Yet, when understood from a more inner tantric perspective, these same women are understood not as ordinary women but as wisdom dakinis. From this point of view, they are known as the &quot;Five Wisdom Dakinis&quot; (Wylie: &quot;Ye-shes mKha-&#x27;gro lnga&quot;). Each of these consorts is believed to be an emanation of the tantric yidam, Vajravārāhī. As one author writes of these relationships: 

In summary, the five consorts/wisdom dakinis were:

* Yeshe Tsogyal of Tibet, who was the emanation of Vajravarahi&#x27;s Speech (Tibetan: &quot;gsung&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;vāk&quot;);
* Mandarava of Zahor, northeast India, who was the emanation of Vajravarahi&#x27;s Body (Tibetan: &quot;sku&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;kāya&quot;); 
* Belwong Kalasiddhi of northwest India, who was the emanation of Vajravarahi&#x27;s Quality (Tibetan: &quot;yon-tan&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;guṇa&quot;);
* Belmo Sakya Devi of Nepal, who was the emanation of Vajravarahi&#x27;s Mind (Tibetan: &quot;thugs&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;citta&quot;); and
* Tashi Kyeden (or Kyedren or Chidren), sometimes called Mangala, of Bhutan and Tiger&#x27;s Nest caves, is an emanation of Vajravarahi&#x27;s Activity (Tibetan: &quot;phrin-las&quot;; Sanskrit: &quot;karma&quot;). Tashi Kyeden is often depicted with Guru Dorje Drolo.

While there are very few sources on the lives of Kalasiddhi, Sakya Devi, and Tashi Kyedren, there are extant biographies of both Yeshe Tsogyal and Mandarava that have been translated into English and other western languages.

== Twenty-five main students ==
Padmasambhava has twenty five main students () in Tibet during the Nyingma&#x27;s school&#x27;s Early Translation period. These students are also called the &quot;Twenty-five King and subjects&quot; and &quot;The King and 25&quot; of Chimphu. In Dudjom Rinpoche&#x27;s list, and in other sources, these include:

<text>The silicoflagellates (order Dictyochales) are a small group of unicellular photosynthetic protists, or algae, belonging to the supergroup of eukaryotes known as Stramenopiles. They behave as plankton and are present in oceanic waters. They are well-known from harmful algal blooms that cause high mortality of fish. Additionally, they compose a rich fossil record represented by their silica skeletons.

== Morphology ==

The silicoflagellates are unicellular protists, composed of cells with one emergent flagellum and a siliceous skeleton constructed from a network of hollow rods outside of the cytoplasm. The morphology of the skeleton can vary greatly, from a simple ring, an ellipse or triangle, to a more complex and complete arrangement of rods. For example, in &quot;Dictyocha fibula&quot; (pictured) the skeleton rods are arranged in a series of peripheral polygons surrounding a central hexagon. These skeletons form a small component of marine sediments, and are well-known microfossils dating as far back as the early Cretaceous.

The silicoflagellates are considered algae due to being photosynthetic. Their chloroplasts are usually present inside the numerous cytoplasmic processes that extend from the central mass of the cytoplasm, where the cell nucleus is located. There is a possibility that silicoflagellate chloroplasts are derived from haptophyte algae through tertiary endosymbiosis.

== Ecology ==

Silicoflagellates are photosynthetic microscopic algae present in the upper part of the marine water column, as plankton. They are adapted to both warm and cold waters. Similarly to diatoms, silicoflagellates are most productive where high levels of silica and nutrients are present in near-surface waters. They are known to cause harmful algal blooms, or red tides, in many parts of Europe. Blooms of silicoflagellates cause fish mortality because their silica skeletons obstruct and abrade fish gills, leading to asphyxiation and subsequent death. Additionally, some silicoflagellates are thought to produce ichthyotoxins, i.e. substances toxic to fish, although their effect is debated. Apart from physical damage to fish, the depletion of dissolved oxygen in water due to their cellular respiration during bloom growth has also caused fish mortality in fisheries and aquaculture.

== Systematics ==

=== Taxonomy ===

In biological classification, silicoflagellates compose the family Dictyochaceae (in botanical nomenclature) or Dictyochidae (in zoological nomenclature), contained within the order Dictyochales or Silicoflagellata. They were previously classified as Chrysophyceae (golden algae). Through morphological and molecular similarities, this group was eventually transferred to the Dictyochophyceae, which contains three additional orders, Pedinellales, Florenciellales and Rhizochromulinales. After decades of phylogenetic analyses, silicoflagellates and the rest of Dictyochophyceae are accepted as a class of the phylum Ochrophyta, within the eukaryotic supergroup Stramenopiles.

=== Genera ===

There are four living genera: &quot;Dictyocha&quot;, &quot;Octactis&quot;, &quot;Stephanocha&quot; (earlier known as &quot;Distephanus&quot;, homonymous with the flowering plant &quot;Distephanus&quot;) and &quot;Vicicitus&quot;, with 11 recognised living species. &quot;Dictyocha&quot; was previously the only member of the order, until &quot;Vicicitus&quot; was created for a species previously assigned to the raphidophyte &quot;Chattonella&quot; but later proven to be a Dictyochophyceae through phylogenetic analyses.

* &quot;Dictyocha&quot; — 4 spp.
* &quot;Octactis&quot; — 2 spp.
* &quot;Stephanocha&quot; (=&quot;Distephanus&quot; ) — 4 spp.
* &quot;Vicicitus&quot; — 1 sp.

There are also several extinct genera, but their classification is difficult, since skeletons may show diverse forms within each living species.

* †&quot;Arctyocha&quot; — 3 spp.
* †&quot;Corbisema&quot; — 5 spp.
* †&quot;Cornua&quot; — 6 spp.
* †&quot;Gleserocha&quot; — 3 spp.
* †&quot;Lyramula&quot; — 2 spp.
* †&quot;Schulzyocha&quot; — 5 spp.
* †&quot;Umpiocha&quot; — 2 spp.
* †&quot;Vallacerta&quot; — 5 spp.
* †&quot;Variramus&quot; — 2 spp.

== Evolution ==

The fossil record of silicoflagellates extends back to early Albian times, in the Early Cretaceous, around 115 million years ago. However, data on Late Cretaceous and Paleocene silicoflagellate evolution is sparse, and they are best known from the Eocene to Recent era. Silicoflagellate skeletons from the Cretaceous are markedly different from Cenozoic ones: before the Santonian (around 85 million years ago) they presented branched, non-ringed shapes. During the Cenozoic, silicoflagellates show an evolutionary trend towards more complicated apical and basal structures, resulting in a design that resembles a hemisphere. As a consequence, after mitosis, the pair of daughter cell skeletons resembles a near-sphere.

<text>Bon or Bön (), also known as Yungdrung Bon (, ), is the indigenous Tibetan religion which shares many similarities and influences with Tibetan Buddhism. It initially developed in the tenth and eleventh centuries but retains elements from earlier Tibetan religious traditions. Bon is a significant minority religion in Tibet, especially in the east, as well as in the surrounding Himalayan regions.

The relationship between Bon and Tibetan Buddhism has been a subject of debate. According to the modern scholar Geoffrey Samuel, while Bon is &quot;essentially a variant of Tibetan Buddhism&quot; with many resemblances to Nyingma, it also preserves some genuinely ancient pre-Buddhist elements. David Snellgrove likewise sees Bon as a form of Buddhism, albeit a heterodox kind. Similarly, John Powers writes that &quot;historical evidence indicates that Bön only developed as a self-conscious religious system under the influence of Buddhism&quot;.

Followers of Bon, known as &quot;Bonpos&quot; (Wylie: ), believe that the religion originated in a kingdom called Zhangzhung, located around Mount Kailash in the Himalayas. Bonpos hold that Bon was brought first to Zhangzhung, and then to Tibet. Bonpos identify the Buddha Shenrab Miwo (Wylie: &quot;gshen rab mi bo&quot;) as Bon&#x27;s founder, although no available sources establish this figure&#x27;s historicity.

Western scholars have posited several origins for Bon, and have used the term &quot;Bon&quot; in many ways. A distinction is sometimes made between an ancient Bon (), dating back to the pre-dynastic era before 618 CE; a classical Bon tradition (also called &quot;Yungdrung Bon&quot; – ) which emerged in the 10th and 11th centuries;
and &quot;New Bon&quot; or Bon Sar (), a late syncretic movement dating back to the 14th century and active in eastern Tibet.

Tibetan Buddhist scholarship tends to cast Bon in a negative, adversarial light, with derogatory stories about Bon appearing in a number of Buddhist histories. The Rimé movement within Tibetan Buddhism encouraged more ecumenical attitudes between Bonpos and Buddhists. Western scholars began to take Bon seriously as a religious tradition worthy of study in the 1960s, in large part inspired by the work of English scholar David Snellgrove. Following the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950, Bonpo scholars began to arrive in Europe and North America, encouraging interest in Bon in the West. Today, a proportion of Tibetans – both in Tibet and in the Tibetan diaspora – practise Bon, and there are Bonpo centers in cities around the world.

==Etymology==
Early Western studies of Bon relied heavily on Buddhist sources, and used the word to refer to the pre-Buddhist religion over which it was thought Buddhism triumphed. Helmut Hoffmann&#x27;s 1950 study of Bon characterised this religion as &quot;animism&quot; and &quot;shamanism&quot;; these characterisations have been controversial. Hoffmann contrasted this animistic-shamanistic folk religion with the organised priesthood of Bonpos which developed later, Shaivism, Buddhist tantras. Hoffman also argued that Gnosticism from the West influenced the systematised Bön religion.

Hoffmann&#x27;s study was foundational for Western understandings of Bon, but was challenged by a later generation of scholars influenced by David Snellgrove, who collaborated with Bonpo masters and translated Bonpo canonical texts. These scholars tended to view Bon as a heterodox form of Buddhism, transmitted separately from the two transmissions from India to Tibet that formed the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. With the translation of Bonpo histories into Western languages as well as increased engagement between Bonpos and Western scholars, a shift took place in Bon studies towards engaging more thoroughly Bonpos&#x27; own histories and self-identification, recognising Bon as an independent religious tradition worthy of academic study.

The term &quot;Bon&quot; has been used to refer to several different phenomena. Drawing from Buddhist sources, early Western commentators on Bon used the term for the pre-Buddhist religious practices of Tibet. These include folk religious practices, cults surrounding royalty, and divination practices. However, scholars have debated whether the term &quot;Bon&quot; should be used for all of these practices, and what their relationship is to the modern Bon religion. In an influential article, R. A. Stein used the term &quot;the nameless religion&quot; to refer to folk religious practices, distinguishing them from Bon.

Per Kvaerne uses Bon solely to refer to a tradition he dates from tenth and eleventh centuries CE, the tradition which developed into the modern Bon religion. Kvaerne identifies this tradition as &quot;an unorthodox form of Buddhism,&quot; but other scholars such as Samten G. Karmay take seriously Bonpo narratives which define Bon as a separate tradition with an origin in the land of &#x27;Olmo Lungring. The term Yungdrung Bon (Wylie: &quot;g.yung drung bon&quot;) is sometimes used to describe this tradition. &quot;Yungdrung&quot; refers to the left-facing swastika, a symbol which occupies in Bon a similar place as the vajra (Wylie: &quot;rdo rje&quot;) in Tibetan Buddhism, symbolising indestructibility and eternity. Yungdrung Bon is a universal religion, although it is mainly limited to Tibetans, with some non-Tibetan converts.

There is also a kind of local village priests which are common throughout the Himalayas that are called &quot;bon&quot;, &quot;lhabon&quot; or &quot;aya&quot; (and bombo in Nepal). These are not part of the Bon religion proper, but are lay ritual specialists, often on a part time basis. Samuel states that it is unclear if these &quot;bon&quot; priests go back to the ancient period or if the term developed after Yungdrung Bon.

Furthermore, the Dongba (东巴) practices of the Nakhi people and the Hangui (韩规) religion of the Pumi people are both believed to have originated from Bon.

== Types ==
As noted by Dmitry Ermakov, &quot;the word Bön is used to denote many diverse religious and cultural traditions.&quot; Bon sources acknowledge this and Bon authors like Shardza Rinpoche (1859–1935), Pelden Tsultrim (1902–1973) and Lopön Tenzin Namdak use a classification of three types of &quot;Bon&quot;. Modern scholars also sometimes rely on this classification, which is as follows:

* Prehistoric Bon (&quot;Gdod ma&#x27;i bon&quot;) of Zhangzhung and Tibet. This is an ancient system of belief and ritual practice that is mostly extinct today. However, elements of it exist in various religious practices found in the Himalayas – mainly in the calling of fortune rituals (g.yang &#x27;gug), the soul retrieval or re-call rituals (bla &#x27;gugs) and the ransom rituals (mdos). Ermakov sees some similarities between this tradition and the Eurasian cult of the sky deer. 
* Eternal Bon (Yungdrung Bon), also called old Bon (Bon Nyingma), which is traced to the Buddha Tonpa Shenrab and other sages from Zhangzhung. These religions developed from the 8th to the 11th century and are similar to Nyingma Buddhism. It includes ancient elements which are pre-Buddhist (including the fortune, bla and ransom rituals).
* New Bon (Bon Sarma, Bonsar), a syncretic tradition which includes elements from Eternal Bon and Tibetan Buddhism, including the worship of the Buddhist figure Padmasambhava. This new movement dates from the 14th century and was mainly active in eastern Tibet.
Dmitry Ermakov also adds an extra category which he terms &quot;mixed Bon&quot; and which he defines as:

==Traditional history==

=== Tonpa Shenrab ===
From the traditional point of view of the Bon religion, Bon was the original religion of Tibet and Zhangzhung which was taught there by various Buddhas, including Tonpa Shenrab (whose name means “Supreme Holy Man”).

Tonpa Shenrab is believed to have received the teaching from the transcendent deity Shenlha Okar in a pure realm before being reborn in the human realm with the purpose of teaching and liberating beings from the cycle of rebirth. He attained Buddhahood several hundred years before Sakyamuni Buddha, in a country west of Tibet, called Olmo Lungring or Tazig (Tasi), which is difficult to identify and acts as a semi-mythical holy land in Bon (like Shambala). Various dates are given for his birth date, one of which corresponds to 1917 BCE. Some Bon texts also state that Sakyamuni was a later manifestation of Tonpa Shenrab.

Tonpa Shenrab is said to have been born to the Tazig royal family and to have eventually become the king of the realm. He is said to be the main Buddha of our era. He had numerous wives and children, constructed numerous temples and performed many rituals in order to spread Bon. Like Padmasambhava, he is also held to have defeated and subjugated many demons through his magical feats, and like King Gesar, he is also believed to have led numerous campaigns against evil forces.

Tonpa Shenrab is held to have visited the kingdom of Zhangzhung (an area in western Tibet around Mount Kailash), where he found a people whose practice involved spiritual appeasement with animal sacrifice. He taught them to substitute offerings with symbolic animal forms made from barley flour. He only taught according to the student&#x27;s capability and thus he taught these people the lower vehicles to prepare them for the study of sutra, tantra and Dzogchen in later lives. It is only later in life that he became a celibate ascetic and it is during this time that he defeated his main enemy, the prince of the demons.

After Tonpa Shenrab&#x27;s paranirvana, his works were preserved in the language of Zhangzhung by ancient Bon siddhas. Most of these teachings were said to have been lost in Tibet after the persecutions against Bon, such as during the time of Trisong Detsen. Bon histories hold that some of Tonpa Shenrab&#x27;s teachings were hidden away as termas and later re-discovered by Bon treasure revealers (tertons), the most important of which is Shenchen Luga (c. early 11th century).

In the fourteenth century, Loden Nyingpo revealed a terma known as &quot;The Brilliance&quot; (), which contained the story of Tonpa Shenrab. He was not the first Bonpo tertön, but his terma became one of the definitive scriptures of Bon.

Bon histories also discuss the lives of other important religious figures, such as the Zhangzhung Dzogchen master Tapihritsa.

=== Origin myths ===
Bon myth also includes other elements which are more obviously pre-Buddhist. According to Samuel, Bonpo texts include a creation narrative (in the &quot;Sipe D zop ’ug&quot;) in which a creator deity, Trigyel Kugpa, also known as Shenlha Okar, creates two eggs, a dark egg and a light egg.

According to Bon scriptures, in the beginning, these two forces, light and dark, created two persons. The black man, called Nyelwa Nakpo (“Black Suffering”), created the stars and all the demons, and is responsible for evil things like droughts. The white man, Öserden (“Radiant One”), is good and virtuous. He created the sun and moon, and taught humans religion. These two forces remain in the world in an ongoing struggle of good and evil which is also fought in the heart of every person.

Powers also writes that according to Bon scriptures, in the beginning, there was only emptiness, which is not a blank void but a pure potentiality. This produced five elements (earth, air, fire, water, and space) which came together into a vast &quot;cosmic egg&quot;, from which a primordial being, Belchen Kékhö, was born.

== History ==
=== Pre-Buddhist Bon and the arrival of Buddhism ===
Little is known about the pre-Buddhist religion of ancient Tibet and scholars of Bon disagree on its nature. Some think that Bon evolved from Zoroastrianism and others say Kashmiri Buddhism.

Bon may have referred to a kind of ritual, a type of priest, or a local religion. In ancient Tibet, there seem to have been a class of priests known as &quot;kushen&quot; (&quot;sku gshen&quot;, “Priests of the Body”, i.e., the king&#x27;s body). This religion was eventually marginalised with the coming of Buddhism and Buddhists wrote critiques and polemics of this religion, some of which survive in manuscripts found in Dunhuang (which refer to these practices as &quot;Bon&quot;).

Likewise, Powers notes that early historical evidence indicates that the term &quot;bon&quot; originally referred to a type of priest who conducted various ceremonies, including priests of the Yarlung kings. Their rituals included propitiating local spirits and guiding the dead through ceremonies to ensure a good afterlife. Their rituals may have involved animal sacrifice, making offerings with food and drink, and burying the dead with precious jewels. The most elaborate rituals involved the Tibetan kings which had special tombs made for them.

Robert Thurman describes at least one type of Bon as a &quot;court religion&quot; instituted &quot;around 100 BCE&quot; by King Pudegungyal, ninth king of the Yarlung dynasty, &quot;perhaps derived from Iranian models&quot;, mixed with existing native traditions. It was focused on &quot;the support of the divine legitimacy of an organized state&quot;, still relatively new in Tibet. Prominent features were &quot;great sacrificial rituals&quot;, especially around royal coronations and burials, and &quot;oracular rites derived from the folk religion, especially magical possessions and healings that required the priests to exhibit shamanic powers&quot;. The king was symbolised by the mountain and the priest/shaman by the sky. The religion was &quot;somewhere between the previous &quot;primitive animism&quot;, and the much changed later types of Bon.

According to David Snellgrove, the claim that Bon came from the West into Tibet is possible, since Buddhism had already been introduced to other areas surrounding Tibet (in Central Asia) before its introduction into Tibet. As Powers writes, &quot;since much of Central Asia at one time was Buddhist, it is very plausible that a form of Buddhism could have been transmitted to western Tibet prior to the arrival of Buddhist missionaries in the central provinces. Once established, it might then have absorbed elements of the local folk religion, eventually developing into a distinctive system incorporating features of Central Asian Buddhism and Tibetan folk religion.&quot;

According to Powers, ancient Bon was closely associated with the royal cult of the kings during the early Tibetan Empire period and they performed &quot;ceremonies to ensure the well-being of the country, guard against evil, protect the king, and enlist the help of spirits in Tibet&#x27;s military ventures.&quot; As Buddhism began to become a more important part of Tibet&#x27;s religious life, ancient Bon and Buddhism came into conflict and there is evidence of anti-Bon polemics. Some sources claim that a debate between Bonpos and Buddhists was held, and that a Tibetan king ruled Buddhism the winner, banishing Bon priests to border regions. However, Gorvine also mentions that in some cases, Bon priests and Buddhist monks would perform rituals together, and thus there was also some collaboration during the initial period of Buddhist dissemination in Tibet.

Bon sources place the blame of the decline of Bon on two persecutions by two Tibetan kings, Drigum Tsenpo and the Buddhist King Tri Songdetsen (r. 740–797). They also state that at this time, Bon terma texts were concealed all over Tibet. Bon sources generally see the arrival of Buddhism in Tibet and the subsequent period of Buddhist religious dominance as a catastrophe for the true doctrine of Bon. They see this as having been caused by demonic forces. However, other more conciliatory sources also state that Tonpa Shenrab and Sakyamuni were cousins and that their teachings are essentially the same.

The most influential historical figure of this period is the Bon lama Drenpa Namkha. Buddhist sources mention this figure as well and there is little doubt he was a real historical figure. He is known for having ordained himself into Bon during a time when the religion was in decline and for having hidden away many Bon termas. Bon tradition holds that he was the father of another important figure, Tsewang Rigzin and some sources also claim he was the father of Padmasambhava, which is unlikely as the great majority of sources say Padmasambhava was born in Swat, Pakistan. A great cult developed around Drenpa Namkha and there is a vast literature about this figure.

=== The development of Yungdrung Bon ===

Yungdrung Bon (Eternal Bon) is a living tradition that developed in Tibet in the 10th and 11th centuries during the later dissemination of Buddhism (sometimes called the renaissance period) and contains many similarities to Tibetan Buddhism. According to Samuel, the origins of modern Yungdrung Bon have much in common with that of the Nyingma school. Samuel traces both traditions to groups of &quot;hereditary ritual practitioners&quot; in Tibet which drew on Buddhist Tantra and &quot;elements of earlier court and village-level ritual&quot; during the 10th and 11th centuries.

These figures were threatened by the arrival of new Buddhist traditions from India which had greater prestige, new ritual repertoires and the full backing of Indian Buddhist scholarship. Both Nyingmapas and Bonpos used the concept of the terma to develop and expand their traditions in competition with the Sarma schools and also to defend their school as being grounded in an authentic ancient tradition. Thus, Bonpo tertons (treasure finders) like Shenchen Luga and Meuton Gongdzad Ritrod Chenpo revealed important Bon termas. An interesting figure of this era is the Dzogchen master and translator Vairotsana, who according to some sources also translated Bon texts into Tibetan and also hid some Bon termas before leaving Tibet.

While Yungdrung Bon and Nyingma originated in similar circles of pre-Sarma era ritual tantric practitioners, they adopted different approaches to legitimate their traditions. Nyingma looked back to the Tibetan Empire period, and Indian Buddhist figures like Padmasambhava. Bonpos meanwhile looked further back, to Tibet&#x27;s pre-Buddhist heritage, to another Buddha who was said to have lived before Sakyamuni, as well as to other masters from the kingdom of Zhangzhung. The main Bonpo figures of the Tibetan renaissance period were tertons (treasure revealers) who are said to have discovered Bon texts that had been hidden away during the era of persecution. These figures include Shenchen Luga (gShen chen Klu dga&#x27;), Khutsa Dawo (Khu tsha zla &#x27;od, b. 1024), Gyermi Nyi O (Gyer mi nyi &#x27;od), and Zhoton Ngodrup (bZhod ston d Ngos grub, c. 12th century). Most of these figures were also laymen. It was also during this era of Bonpo renewal that the Bon Kanjur and Tenjur were compiled.

Just like all forms of Tibetan Buddhism, Yungdrung Bon eventually developed a monastic tradition, with celibate monks living in various monasteries. Bon monks are called &quot;trangsong&quot;, a term that translates the Sanskrit rishi (seer, or sage). A key figure in the establishment of Bon monasticism was Nyamme Sherab Gyaltsen (mNyam med Shes rab rgyal mtshan, c. 1356–1415). According to Jean Luc Achard, &quot;his insistence on Madhyamaka, logic, gradual path (lamrim) and philosophical studies has modeled the now traditional approach of practice in most Bon po monasteries.&quot; His tradition emphasises the importance of combining the study of sutra, tantra and Dzogchen. The most important Bon monastery is Menri monastery, which was built in 1405 in Tsang. Bon monks, like their Buddhist counterparts, study scripture, train in philosophical debate and perform rituals. However, Bon also has a strong tradition of lay yogis.

=== The era of New Bon ===

&quot;New Bon&quot; (&quot;bonsar&quot;, or sarma Bon) is a more recent development in the Bon tradition, which is closely related to both Eternal Bon and the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism. It is centered on the figures of Drenpa Namkha, Tsewang Rigdzin and Padmasambhava, which in this school are considered to have transmitted and written commentaries on the works of Tonpa Shenrab in around the 8th century.

According to Jean Luc Achard, the New Bon movement begins in Eastern Tibet with the works of Tulku Loden Nyingpo (1360–1385), a terton who discovered the &quot;Zibji&quot; (&quot;gzi brjid&quot;), a famous Tonpa Shenrab biography. His reincarnation, Techen Mishik Dorje is also known for his terma revelations.

The movement continued to develop, with new Bon terma texts being revealed well into the 18th century by influential tertons like Tulku Sangye Lingpa (b. 1705) and the first Kundrol Drakpa (b. 1700). New Bon figures do not consider their revelations to be truly &quot;new&quot;, in the sense that they do not see their revelations as being ultimately different from Yungdrung Bon. However, some followers of more orthodox Yundrung Bon lineages, like the Manri tradition, saw these termas as being influenced by Buddhism. Later New Bon figures like Shardza Rinpoche (1859–1934) responded to these critiques (see his &quot;Treasury of Good Sayings&quot;, &quot;legs bshad mdzod&quot;). The work of these New Bon figures led to the flourishing of New Bon in Eastern Tibet.

Some Tibetan tertons like Dorje Lingpa were known to have revealed New Bon termas as well as Nyingma termas.

Lobsang Yeshe (1663–1737), recognised as the 5th Panchen Lama by the 5th Dalai Lama (1617–1682), was a member of the Dru family, an important Bon family. Samten Karmay sees this choice as a gesture of reconciliation with Bon by the Fifth Dalai Lama (who had previously converted some Bon monasteries to Gelug ones by force). Under the Fifth Dalai Lama, Bon was also officially recognised as a Tibetan religion. Bon suffered extensively during the Dzungar invasion of Tibet in 1717, when many Nyingmapas and Bonpos were executed.

===Modern period===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bon tradition (both New Bon and Eternal Bon lineages) flourished in Eastern Tibet, led by charismatic Bonpo lamas like bDe ch en gling pa, d Bal gter sTag s lag can (bsTan &#x27;dzin dbang rgyal), gSang sngags gling pa, and Shardza Rinpoche.

Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen (1859–1933) was a particularly important Bon master of this era, whose collected writings comprise up to eighteen volumes (or sometimes twenty). According to William M. Gorvine, this figure is &quot;the Bon religion&#x27;s most renowned and influential luminary of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.&quot; He was associated with the orthodox Eternal Bon Manri monastery tradition as well as with New Bon figures like the 5th and 6th Kun grol incarnations, gSang sngags gling pa (b. 1864) and bDe chen gling pa (1833–1893) as well as with dBal bon sTag lag ca n, bsTan &#x27; d zin dbang rgyal (b. 1832). These figures maintained the orthodox Manri tradition of Eternal Bon, while also holding New Bon terma lineages.

Shardza Rinpoche is also known to have had connections with the non-sectarian Buddhist lamas of the Rime movement and to have taught both Buddhists and Bonpos.

Shardza Rinpoche had many disciples, including his nephew Lodro Gyatso (1915–1954) who led the lineage and Shardza&#x27;s hermitage and college, after Shardza&#x27;s passing. His disciple Kagya Khyungtrul Jigmey Namkha trained many practitioners to be learned in not only the Bon religion, but in all Tibetan sciences. More than three hundred Bon monasteries had been established in Tibet before Chinese occupation. Of these, Menri Monastery and Shurishing Yungdrung Dungdrakling Monastery were the two principal monastic universities for the study and practice of Bon.

=== Present situation ===

In 2019, scholars estimate that there were 400,000 Bon followers in the Tibetan plateau. When Tibet was invaded by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, there were approximately 300 Bon monasteries in Tibet and the rest of western China. Bon suffered the same fate as Tibetan Buddhism did during the Chinese Cultural revolution, though their monasteries were allowed to rebuild after 1980.

The present spiritual head of the Bon is Menri Trizin Rinpoché, successor of Lungtok Tenpai Nyima (1929–2017), the thirty-fourth Abbot of Menri Monastery (destroyed in the Cultural Revolution, but now rebuilt), who now presides over Pal Shen-ten Menri Ling in Dolanji in Himachal Pradesh, India. The 33rd lineage holder of Menri Monastery, Menri Trizin Lungtog Tenpei Nyima and Lopön Tenzin Namdak are important current lineage holders of Bon.

A number of Bon establishments also exist in Nepal; Triten Norbutse Bonpo Monastery is one on the western outskirts of Kathmandu. Bon&#x27;s leading monastery in India is the refounded Menri Monastery in Dolanji, Himachal Pradesh.

==== Official recognition ====
Bonpos remained a stigmatised and marginalised group until 1979, when they sent representatives to Dharamshala and the 14th Dalai Lama, who advised the Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration to accept Bon members. Before this recognition, during the previous twenty years, the Bon community had received none of the financial support which was channelled through the Dalai Lama&#x27;s office and were often neglected and treated dismissively in the Tibetan refugee community.

Since 1979, Bon has had official recognition of its status as a religious group, with the same rights as the Buddhist schools. This was re-stated in 1987 by the Dalai Lama, who also forbade discrimination against the Bonpos, stating that it was both undemocratic and self-defeating. He even donned Bon ritual paraphernalia, emphasising &quot;the religious equality of the Bon faith&quot;. The Dalai Lama now sees Bon as the fifth Tibetan religion and has given Bonpos representation on the Council of Religious Affairs at Dharamsala.

However, Tibetans still differentiate between Bon and Buddhism, referring to members of the Nyingma, Shakya, Kagyu and Gelug schools as &quot;nangpa&quot;, meaning &quot;insiders&quot;, but to practitioners of Bon as &quot;Bonpo&quot;, or even &quot;chipa&quot; (&quot;outsiders&quot;).

== Teachings ==

According to Samuel, the teachings of Bon closely resemble those of Tibetan Buddhism, especially those of the Nyingma school. Bon monasticism has also developed a philosophical and debate tradition which is modelled on the tradition of the Gelug school. Like Buddhism, Bon teachings see the world as a place of suffering and seek spiritual liberation. They teach karma and rebirth as well as the six realms of existence found in Buddhism.

Bon lamas and monks fill similar roles as those of Tibetan Buddhist lamas and the deities and rituals of Bon often resemble Buddhist ones, even if their names and iconography differ in other respects. For example, the Bon deity Phurba is almost the same deity as Vajrakilaya, while Chamma closely resembles Tara.

Per Kværne writes that, at first glance, Bon &quot;appear to be nearly indistinguishable from Buddhism with respect to its doctrines, monastic life, rituals, and meditational practices.&quot; However, both religions agree that they are distinct, and a central distinction is that Bon&#x27;s source of religious authority is not the Indian Buddhist tradition, but what it considers to be the eternal religion which it received from Zhangzhung (in Western Tibet) and ultimately derives from land called Tazik where Tonpa Shenrab lived, ruled as king and taught Bon. Bon also includes many rituals and concerns that are not as common in Tibetan Buddhism. Many of these are worldly and pragmatic, such as divination rituals, funerary rituals that are meant to guide a deceased person&#x27;s consciousness to higher realms and appeasing local deities through ransom rituals.

In the Bon worldview, the term &quot;Bon&quot; means “truth,” “reality,” and “the true doctrine.” The Bon religion, which is revealed by enlightened beings, provides ways of dealing with the mundane world as well as a path to spiritual liberation. Bon doctrine is generally classified in various ways, including the &quot;nine ways&quot; and the four portals and the fifth, the treasury.

=== Worldview ===
According to Bon, all of reality is pervaded by a transcendent principle, which has a male aspect called Kuntuzangpo (All-Good) and a female aspect called Kuntuzangmo. This principle is an empty dynamic potentiality. It is also identified with what is called the &quot;bon body&quot; (bon sku), which is the true nature of all phenomena and is similar to the Buddhist idea of the Dharmakaya, as well as with the &quot;bon nature&quot; (bon nyid), which is similar to &quot;Buddha nature&quot;. This ultimate principle is the source of all reality and to achieve spiritual liberation, one must have insight into this ultimate nature.

According to John Myrdhin Reynolds, Bonpo Dzogchen is said to reveal one&#x27;s Primordial State (ye gzhi) or Natural State (gnas-lugs) which is described in terms of intrinsic primordial purity (ka-dag) and spontaneous perfection in manifestation (lhun-grub).

The Bon Dzogchen understanding of reality is explained by Powers as follows:

=== Classification of the teachings ===
According to John Myrdhin Reynolds, the main Bon teachings are classified into three main schemas:

# The Nine Successive Vehicles to Enlightenment (theg-pa rim dgu);
# Four Portals of Bon and the fifth which is the Treasury (sgo bzhi mdzod lnga);
# The Three Cycles of Precepts that are Outer, Inner, and Secret (bka&#x27; phyi nang gsang skor gsum).

==== The Nine Ways or Vehicles ====
Samuel notes that Bon tends to be more accepting and explicit in their embrace of the practical side of life (and the importance of life rituals and worldly activities) which falls under the &quot;Bon of cause&quot; division of &quot;the Nine Ways of Bon&quot; (&quot;bon theg pa rim dgu&quot;). This schema includes all the teachings of Bon and divides them into nine main classes, which are as follows:
* Way of Prediction (&quot;phyva gshen theg pa&quot;) codifies ritual, divination, medicine, and astrology;
* Way of the Visual World (&quot;snang shen theg pa&quot;) teaches rituals for local gods and spirits for good fortune
* Way of Magic (&quot;&#x27;phrul gshen theg pa&quot;) explains the magical excorcistic rites for the destruction of adverse entities.
* Way of Life (&quot;srid gshen theg pa&quot;) details funeral and death rituals as well as ways to protect the life force of the living
* Way of a Lay Follower (&quot;dge bsnyen theg pa&quot;) lay morality, contains the ten principles for wholesome activity as well as worldly life rituals
* Way of an Ascetic (&quot;drang srong theg pa&quot;) or &quot;Swastika Bon&quot; focuses on ascetic practice, meditation and monastic life;
* Way of Primordial Sound (&quot;a dkar theg pa&quot;) or the Way of the White A, this refers to tantric practices and secret mantras (&quot;gsang sngags&quot;);
* Way of Primordial Shen, (&quot;ye gshen theg pa&quot;) refers to certain special yogic methods. This corresponds to the Nyingma school&#x27;s Anuyoga.
* The Supreme Way (&quot;bla med theg pa&quot;), or The Way of Dzogchen (Great Perfection). Like the Nyingmapas, Bonpos consider Dzogchen to be the superior meditative path.
Traditionally, the Nine Ways are taught in three versions: in the Central, Northern and Southern treasures. The Central treasure is closest to Nyingma Nine Yānas teaching and the Northern treasure is lost. Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche elaborated the Southern treasure with shamanism.

The nine ways are classified into two main divisions in the &quot;Southern Treasure&quot; terma tradition: 
* &quot;Bon of Cause&quot; (&quot;rgyu&quot;), comprises the first four of the above;
* &quot;Bon of the Effect&quot; (&quot;&#x27;bras bu&quot;) includes the fifth through ninth, the superior path being the Way of Dzogchen (as in the Nyingma school).

==== The Four Portals and the Fifth, the Treasury ====
This classification, called The Four Portals and the Fifth, the Treasury (&quot;sgo bzhi mdzod lnga&quot;), is a different and independent system of classification. The main sets of teachings here are divided up as follows: 
* The Bon of &quot;the White Waters&quot; containing the Fierce Mantras (chab dkar drag-po sngags kyi bon) deals with tantric or esoteric matters, mainly fierce or wrathful practices and deities.
* The Bon of &quot;the Black Waters&quot; for the continuity of existence (chab nag srid-pa rgyud kyi bon) concerns divination, magic, funeral rites, purification rituals and ransom rituals.
* The Bon of the Extensive Prajnaparamita from the country of Phanyul (&#x27;phan-yul rgyas-pa &#x27;bum gyi bon) includes teachings on lay and monastic ethics, as well as expositions of Prajnaparamita philosophy.
* The Bon of the Scriptures and the Secret Oral Instructions of the Masters (dpon-gsas man-ngag lung gi bon) deals mainly with Dzogchen teachings.
* The Bon of the Treasury which is of the highest purity and is all-inclusive (gtsang mtho-thog spyi-rgyug mdzod kyi bon), this is an anthology of the salient items of the Four Portals.

==== The Three Cycles ====
The Three Cycles of Precepts that are Outer, Inner, and Secret (bka&#x27; phyi nang gsang skor gsum) are:

* The Outer Cycle (phyi skor) deals with sutra teachings on the path of renunciation.
* The Inner Cycle (nang skor) contains Tantric teachings (rgyud-lugs) and is known as the path of transformation (sgyur lam).
* The Secret Cycle (gsang skor) contains the Dzogchen intimate instructions (man-ngag) and is known as the Path of Self-Liberation (grol lam).

=== Traditions of Bon Dzogchen ===

There are three main Bon Dzogchen traditions:

* &quot;The Zhang-zhung Aural Lineage&quot; (&quot;Zhang-zhung nyen-gyu&quot;) – This tradition is ultimately traced to the primordial Buddha Kuntu Zangpo, who taught it to nine Sugatas, the last being Sangwa Düpa. These teachings were then passed down by twenty four Dzogchen masters in Tazik and Zhangzhung, all of which are said to have attained rainbow body. The lineage eventually reached the 7th century siddha Tapihritsa, the last of the 24 masters. He later appeared to the 8th century Zhangzhung siddha Gyerpung Nangzher Lödpo, who was in retreat near Darok Lake, and gave him a direct introduction to Dzogchen. Gyerpung Nangzher Lödpo transmitted the teachings to numerous disciples who also wrote the teachings down. This lineage continued until it reached Pön-gyal Tsänpo, who translated these works into Tibetan from the language of Zhangzhung.
* &quot;A-khrid&quot; (&quot;The Teaching Leading to the Primordial State i.e. A&quot;) – This tradition was founded by Meuton Gongdzad Ritrod Chenpo (&#x27;The Great Hermit Meditation-Treasury of the family of rMe&#x27;u&#x27;, c. 11th century). These teachings are divided into three sections dealing with the view (lta-ba), the meditation (sgom-pa), and the conduct (spyod-pa) and is structured into a set of eighty meditation sessions which extend over several weeks. Later figures like Aza Lodo Gyaltsan and Druchen Gyalwa Yungdrung condensed the practices down to a smaller number of sessions. The great Bonpo master Shardza Rinpoche wrote extensive commentaries on the A-khrid system and its associated dark retreat practice.
* &quot;Dzogchen Yangtse Longchen&quot; – This system is based on a terma named the &quot;rDzogs-chen yang-rtse&#x27;i klong-chen&quot; (&quot;the Great Vast Expanse of the Highest Peak which is the Great Perfection,&quot;) which was discovered by Zhodton Ngodrub Dragpa in 1080 (inside of a statue of Vairocana). The terma is attributed to the eighth century Bonpo master Lishu Tagrin. 
Donnatella Rossi also mentions two more important cycles of Bon Dzogchen teachings:

* &quot;Ye khri mtha&#x27; sel&quot;, also known as the Indian Cycle (&quot;rgya gar gyi skor&quot;), which is attributed to the eighth century Zhangzhung master Dranpa Namkha and is said to have been transmitted in the 11th century to Lung Bon lHa gnyan by a miraculous apparition of Dranpa Namkha&#x27;s son.
* &quot;Byang chub sems gab pa dgu skor,&quot; which is classified as an important Southern Treasure text and was discovered by Shenchen Luga (996–1035), a major figure of the later diffusion of Bon.

== Pantheon ==

=== Enlightened beings ===
Bon deities share some similarities to Buddhist Mahayana deities and some are also called &quot;Buddhas&quot; (sanggye), but they also have unique names, iconography and mantras. As in Tibetan Buddhism, Bon deities can be &quot;peaceful&quot; or &quot;wrathful&quot;.

The most important of the peaceful deities are the &quot;Four Transcendent Lords, Deshek Tsozhi (bDer gshegs gtso bzhi).&quot; Each of these four beings has many different forms and manifestations. These are:

* &quot;The Mother&quot; Satrig Ersang, a female Buddha whose name means wisdom and who is similar to Prajnaparamita (and is also yellow in colour). Her &quot;five heroic syllables&quot; are: SRUM, GAM, RAM, YAM, OM. One of her most important manifestations is Sherab Chamma (loving lady of wisdom), a female bodhisattva like being.
* &quot;The God&quot; Shenlha Ökar (wisdom priest of white light) or Shiwa Ökar (peaceful white light), a deity of wisdom light and compassion, whose main color is white. He is associated with the Dharmakaya. Kvaerne sees some similarities with Amitabha. Another important Dharmakaya deity is Kuntuzangpo (Samantabhadra, All Good), the primordial Buddha, which serves a similar function to the figure of the same name in the Nyingma school Both Kuntuzangpo and Shenlha Ökar are seen as personifications of the &#x27;Body of Bon&#x27;, or Ultimate Reality. In Bon, Kuntunzangpo is often presented in a slightly different form called Kunzang Akor (&#x27;the All-Good, Cycle of A&#x27;), depicted seated in meditation with a letter A in his breast. 
* &quot;The Procreator&quot; (sipa), Sangpo Bumtri. He is the being who brings forth the beings of this world and plays an important role in Bon cosmogonic myths. He is associated with the sambhogakaya.
* &quot;The Teacher&quot; Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche (meaning: Supreme Priest, Great Man). He is associated with the nirmanakaya and is the present teacher of Bon in this era.
Bon Yidams (meditation or tutelary deities) are those deities which are often used in meditative tantric practice and are the mainly fierce or wrathful forms. These class of deities resemble Buddhist yidams like Chakrasamvara and Hevajra. It includes figures like Magyu Sangchog Tartug (&#x27;Supreme Secret of Mother Tantras, Attaining the Limit&#x27;), Trowo Tsochog Khagying (&#x27;Wrathful One, Supreme Lord Towering in the Sky&#x27;), Welse Ngampa (&#x27;Fierce Piercing Deity&#x27;), and Meri (&#x27;Mountain of Fire&#x27;). The Bonpos also have a tantric tradition of a deity called Purpa, which is very similar to the Nyingma deity Vajrakilaya.

Like the Buddhists, the Bon pantheon also includes various protector deities, siddhas (perfected ones), lamas (teachers) and dakinis. Some key figures are Drenpa Namkha (a major 8th century Bon lama whose name is also mentioned in Buddhist sources), the sage Takla Mebar (a disciple of Tonpa Shenrab), Sangwa Dupa (a sage from Tazik), Zangsa Ringtsun (Auspicious Lady of Long Life).

=== Worldly gods and spirits ===
The Bon cosmos contains numerous other deities, including Shangpo and Chucham (a goddess of water) who produced nine gods and goddesses. There is also the 360 Kékhö, who live on the mount Tisé (Kailash) and the 360 Werma deities. These are associated with the 360 days of the year.

Another set of deities are the White Old Man, a sky god, and his consort. They are known by a few different names, such as the Gyalpo Pehar called “King Pehar” (). Pehar is featured as a protecting deity of Zhangzhung, the center of the Bon religion. Reportedly, Pehar is related to celestial heavens and the sky in general. In early Buddhist times, Pehar transmogrified into a shamanic bird to adapt to the bird motifs of shamanism. Pehar&#x27;s consort is a female deity known by one of her names as Düza Minkar ().

Bonpos cultivate household gods in addition to other deities and the layout of their homes may include various seats for protector deities.

Chinese influence is also seen is some of the deities worshiped in Bon. For example, Confucius is worshipped in Bon as a holy king and master of magic, divination and astrology. He is also seen as being a reincarnation of Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche, the legendary founder of Bon.

In the Balti version of Bon in Baltistan, deities such as &quot;lha&quot; (gods), &quot;klu&quot; (serpents or dragons) and &quot;lhamo&quot; (goddesses) are worshipped, and many legends about these deities still exist among the local population.

==Bon literature==

Bon texts can be divided into translations of teachings (the words of Buddha Shenrab, found in the Bon Kanjur) and translations of treatises (philosophical and commentarial texts, the Bon Tenjur). The Bon Kanjur comprises four main categories: the Sutras (&quot;mdo&quot;), the Perfection of Wisdom Teachings (&quot;&#x27;bum&quot;), the Tantras (&quot;rgyud&quot;) and Higher Knowledge (&quot;mdzod,&quot; &#x27;Treasure-house&#x27;), which deals with the supreme forms of meditation. The Tenjur material is classified into three main categories according to Kvaerne: &quot;&#x27;External&#x27;, including commentaries on canonical texts dealing with monastic discipline, morality; metaphysics and the biographies of Tonpa Shenrap; &#x27;Internal&#x27;, comprising the commentaries on the Tantras including rituals focusing on the tantric deities and the cult of dakinis, goddesses whose task it is to protect the Doctrine, and worldly rituals of magic and divination; and finally &#x27;Secret&#x27;, a section that deals with meditational practices.&quot;

Besides these, the Bon canon includes material on rituals, arts and crafts, logic, medicine, poetry and narrative. According to Powers, Bon literature includes numerous ritual and liturgical treatises, which share some similarities to Tibetan Buddhist ritual. According to Per Kvaerne, &quot;while no precise date for the formation of the Bonpo Kanjur can be ascertained at present...it does not seem to contain texts which have come to light later than 1386. A reasonable surmise would be that the Bonpo Kanjur was assembled by 1450.&quot;

According to Samuel, Bon texts are similar to Buddhist texts and thus suggest &quot;a considerable amount of borrowing between the two traditions in the tenth and eleventh centuries. While it has generally been assumed that this borrowing proceeds from Buddhist to Bonpo, and this seems to have been the case for the Phurba practice, some of it may well have been in the opposite direction.&quot; Powers similarly notes that &quot;many Bön scriptures are nearly identical to texts in the Buddhist canon, but often have different titles and Bön technical terms&quot; and &quot;only a few Bön texts that seem to predate Buddhism.&quot; While Western scholars initially assumed that this similarity with Buddhist texts was mere plagiarism, the work of Snellgrove and others have reassessed this view and now most scholars of Bon hold that in many cases, Buddhist texts borrow and reproduce Bon texts. Per Kværne writes that &quot;this does not mean that Bon was not at some stage powerfully influenced by Buddhism; but once the two religions, Bon and Buddhism, were established as rival traditions in Tibet, their relationship was a complicated one of mutual influence.

Regarding the current status of the Bon canon, Powers writes that:

=== Termas ===
The largest part of the Bon canon is made up of numerous termas (treasure texts), which were believed to have been hidden away during the period of persecution and to have begun to be discovered during the 10th century. Bonpos hold that their termas were hidden by masters like Drenpa Namkha during the period of decline and persecution under King Trisong Detsen, and then were rediscovered by later Bon tertons (treasure discoverers).

The three principal terma of Yungdrung Bon are:

* the &quot;Northern Treasure&quot; (), compiled from texts revealed in Zhangzhung and northern Tibet
* the &quot;Central Treasure&quot; (), from Central Tibet
* the &quot;Southern Treasure&quot; (), revealed in Bhutan and Southern Tibet.

Three Bon scriptures—&quot;mdo &#x27;dus&quot;, &quot;gzer mig&quot;, and &quot;gzi brjid&quot;—relate the mythos of Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche. The Bonpos regard the first two as &quot;gter ma&quot; rediscovered around the tenth and eleventh centuries and the last as &quot;nyan brgyud&quot; (oral transmission) dictated by Loden Nyingpo, who lived in the fourteenth century.

&quot;A Cavern of Treasures&quot; () is a Bon terma uncovered by Shenchen Luga () in the early 11th century which is an important source for the study of the Zhang-Zhung language.

The main Bon great perfection teachings are found in terma texts called &quot;The Three Cycles of Revelation&quot;. The primary Bon Dzogchen text is &quot;The Golden Tortoise&quot;, which was revealed by Ngödrup Drakpa (c. 11th century). According to Samten Karmay, these teachings are similar to those of the Semde class in Nyingma. According to Jean Luc Achard, the main Dzogchen cycle studied and practised in contemporary Bon is &quot;The Oral Transmission of the Great Perfection in Zhangzhung&quot; (&quot;rDzogs pa chen po zhang zhung snyan rgyud&quot;)&quot;,&quot; a cycle which includes teachings on the Dzogchen practices of trekcho and thogal (though it uses different terms to refer to these practices) and is attributed to the Zhangzhung sage Tapihritsa.

<text>Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, 1st Baronet, KCSI (3 March 1829 – 11 March 1894) was an English lawyer, judge, writer, and philosopher. One of the most famous critics of John Stuart Mill, Stephen achieved prominence as a philosopher, law reformer, and writer.

== Early life and education, 1829–1854 ==
James Fitzjames Stephen was born on 3 March 1829 at Kensington Gore, London, the third child and second son of Sir James Stephen and Jane Catherine Venn. Stephen came from a distinguished family. His father, the drafter of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, was Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies and Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge. His grandfather James Stephen and uncle George Stephen were both leading anti-slavery campaigners. His younger brother was the author and critic Sir Leslie Stephen, whilst his younger sister Caroline Stephen was a philanthropist and a writer on Quakerism. Through his brother Leslie Stephen, he was the uncle of Virginia Woolf. He was also a cousin of the jurist A. V. Dicey.

Stephen was first educated at the Reverend Benjamin Guest&#x27;s school in Brighton from the age of seven, before spending three years at Eton College from 1842. Strongly disliking Eton, Stephen completed his pre-university education by attending King&#x27;s College, London for two years.

In October 1847 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. Although an outstanding intellect, he took an undistinguished BA in Classics in 1851, being, in his own words, one of the &quot;most unteachable of human beings&quot;. He was, however, well-known as a strong debater at the Cambridge Union. He was also elected to the exclusive Cambridge Apostles, his proposer being Henry Maine, the newly appointed Regius Professor of Civil Law, who became a lifelong friend despite their differing temperaments. At Apostles meetings, he frequently sparred with William Harcourt, later leader of the Liberal Party, in debates described by contemporaries as &quot;veritable battles of the gods&quot;. Another Apostles contemporary was the physicist James Clerk Maxwell.

Being conscious of the slightness of his legal education, he then read for an LL.B. from the University of London. This was an unusual step for its day, and it was there that he first seriously engaged with the works of Jeremy Bentham.

== Early career, 1854–1869 ==

After leaving Cambridge, Stephen chose to enter a legal career, though his father had hoped for a clerical career. He was called to the bar in January 1854 by the Inner Temple, and joined the Midland Circuit. His own estimation of his professional success—written in later years—was that in spite of such training rather than because of it, he became a moderately successful advocate and a rather distinguished judge.

In his earlier years at the bar he supplemented his income from a successful but modest practice as a journalist. He contributed to the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; from the time it was founded in 1855. He was in company with Maine, Harcourt, G. S. Venables, Charles Bowen, E. A. Freeman, Goldwin Smith and others. Both the first and the last books published by Stephen were selections from his papers in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; (&quot;Essays by a Barrister&quot;, 1862, anonymous; &quot;Horae sabbaticae&quot;, 1892). These volumes embodied the results of his studies of publicists and theologians, chiefly English, from the 17th century onwards. He never professed his essays to be more than the occasional products of an amateur&#x27;s leisure, but they were well received.

From 1858 to 1861, Stephen served as secretary to a Royal Commission on popular education, whose conclusions were promptly put into effect. In 1859 he was appointed Recorder of Newark. In 1863 he published his &quot;General View of the Criminal Law of England&quot;, the first attempt made since William Blackstone to explain the principles of English law and justice in a literary form, and it enjoyed considerable success. The foundation of the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; in 1865 gave Stephen a new literary avenue. He continued to contribute until he became a judge. 

Stephen&#x27;s practice at the Bar was an uneven one, though he appeared in two notable cases. In 1861–62, he unsuccessfully defended the Reverend Rowland Williams in the Court of Arches against charges of heresy, though he was ultimately acquitted in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In 1865–66, Stephen was retained (along with Edward James QC) by the Jamaica Committee, which sought to prosecute Edward Eyre, Governor of Jamaica, for his excesses in suppressing the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865. They produced a legal opinion, which charged Eyre and his officers with serious breaches of English criminal law, some of them capital. 

In early 1867, Stephen was retained by the Jamaica Committee to prosecute Alexander Abercromby Nelson and Herbert Brand, two military officers who had sat on the court martial which sentenced George William Gordon to death; but the grand jury declined to return a true bill. He was then retained to prosecute Eyre: when he began his case, Stephen surprised observers by praising Eyre as a courageous man who had acted honourably in an emergency. Eyre was discharged and Stephen fell out with the Jamaica Committee. His friendship with John Stuart Mill, who was a leading member of the Committee, was permanently damaged. Stephen was a critic of Mill&#x27;s &quot;sentimental liberalism&quot;, arguing that the British government was justified in applying force to prevent subject societies from descending into anarchy. 

Meanwhile, Stephen&#x27;s legal career proceeded apace, and in 1868, he became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel, one of fifteen that year. However, he suffered a setback in January 1869, when he was passed over for the Whewell Professorship of International Law in favour of his old rival William Harcourt.

== Stephen in India, 1869–1872 ==
The decisive point of Stephen&#x27;s career was in the summer of 1869, when he accepted the post of legal member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council in India. His appointment was at the recommendation of his friend Henry Maine, who was his immediate predecessor. He arrived in India in December 1869. During his time in India, Stephen would draft twelve acts and eight other enactments, most of which are still in force.

Guided by Maine&#x27;s comprehensive talents, the government of India had entered a period of systematic legislation which was to last about twenty years. Stephen had the task of continuing this work by conducting the Bills through the Legislative Council. The Native Marriages Act of 1872 was the result of deep consideration on both Maine&#x27;s and Stephen&#x27;s part. The Indian Contract Act had been framed in England by a learned commission, and the draft was materially altered in Stephen&#x27;s hands before, also in 1872, it became law.

=== Indian Evidence Act ===

The Indian Evidence Act of the same year, entirely Stephen&#x27;s own work, made the rules of evidence uniform for all residents of India, regardless of caste, social position, or religion. Besides drafting legislation, at this time Stephen had to attend to the current administrative business of his department, and he took a full share in the general deliberations of the viceroy&#x27;s council. His last official act in India was the publication of a minute on the administration of justice which pointed the way to reforms not yet fully realized, and is still a valuable tool for anyone wishing to understand the judicial system of British India.

== Return to England, 1872–1879 ==

Stephen returned, mainly for family reasons, to England in the spring of 1872. During the voyage he wrote a series of articles which resulted in his book &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot; (1873–1874)--a protest against John Stuart Mill&#x27;s neo-utilitarianism. Around this time, Leslie Stephen noted the influence of Thomas Carlyle on his brother&#x27;s thought. This showed in Stephen&#x27;s famous attack on the thesis of John Stuart Mill&#x27;s essay &quot;On Liberty&quot;, arguing for legal compulsion, coercion and restraint in the interests of morality and religion. Stephen argued, &quot;Force is an absolutely essential element of all law whatever.&quot;

Fitzjames Stephen stood in an 1873 by-election as a Liberal for Dundee, but came in last place. The same year, he was elected to the Metaphysical Society; he gave seven papers to the Society, making him one of its most active members. In 1875, he was appointed Professor of Common Law at the Inns of Court. He also sat on government commissions on fugitive slaves (1876), extradition (1878), and copyright (1878). He also appeared irregularly as counsel in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

Experience in India gave Stephen opportunity for his next activity. The government of India had been driven by the conditions of the Indian judicial system to recast a considerable part of the English law which had been informally imported. Criminal law procedure, and a good deal of commercial law, had been or were being put into easily understood language, intelligible to civilian magistrates. The rational substance of the law was preserved, while disorder and excessive technicalities were removed. Using Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s ideal of codification, he attempted to get the same principles put into practice in the United Kingdom. As a preparatory step, Stephen also privately published digests in code form of the law of evidence (1876) and criminal law (1877).

In August 1877, Stephen&#x27;s proposals were taken up by the government and he was asked to draft a criminal code for England. He completed his draft in early 1878 and it was debated in Parliament, after which it was referred to a Royal Commission under the chairmanship of Lord Blackburn, with Stephen as a member. In 1879, the Commission produced a draft bill, which received opposition from many quarters. It did, however, serve as the basis of the criminal codes of many parts of the British Empire, including those of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

== Judicial career and final years, 1879–1894 ==

After his return from India, Stephen had sought a judgeship for both professional and financial reasons. In 1873, 1877, and 1878, he went on circuit as a commissioner of assize. In 1878 he was considered, but not selected, as Recorder of London in succession to Russell Gurney. In 1873, he had also been proposed as Solicitor-General by Sir John Coleridge, the Attorney-General, though Sir Henry James was chosen instead. 

When Stephen was charged with the preparation of the English criminal code, he was virtually promised a judgeship, though no explicit promise could be made. Finally, in January 1879, Stephen was appointed a Justice of the High Court, in succession to Sir Anthony Cleasby. He was initially assigned to the Exchequer Division. When that division was merged into the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division in 1881, Stephen was transferred to the latter, where he remained until his retirement. Occupied with the preparation of the criminal code, he only made his first appearance as a judge in April 1879 at the Old Bailey, when he passed a death sentence against a matricide. 

Distracted by his literary and intellectual pursuits, his time as a judge was unimpressive relative to the rest of his career, though his judgments were of a high quality. He had transient hopes of an Evidence Act being brought before Parliament, and in 1878 the Digest of Criminal Law became a Ministerial Bill with the cooperation of Sir John Holker, who was Attorney-General in the second government of Benjamin Disraeli. The Bill was referred to a judicial commission, which included Stephen, but ultimately failed, and was revised and reintroduced in 1879 and again in 1880. It dealt with procedure as well as substantive law, and provided for a court of criminal appeal, though after several years of judicial experience Stephen changed his mind as to the wisdom of this course. However, no substantial progress was made during any sessions of Parliament. In 1883 the part relating to procedure was brought in separately by Gladstone&#x27;s law officer Sir Henry James, and went to the grand committee on law, which found that there was insufficient time to deal with it satisfactorily in the course of the session. 

Stephen&#x27;s final years were undermined first by physical and then steady mental decline. In 1885, he had his first stroke. Despite accusations of unfairness and bias regarding the murder trials of Israel Lipski in 1887 and Florence Maybrick in 1889, Stephen continued performing his judicial duties. However, by early 1891 his declining capacity to exercise judicial functions had become a matter of public discussion and press comment, and following medical advice Stephen resigned in April of that year, whereupon he was made a baronet. Even during his final days on the bench, Stephen is reported to have been &#x27;brief, terse and to the point, and as lucid as in the old days&#x27;. Having lost his intellectual power, however, &#x27;as the hours wore on his voice dropped almost to a whisper&#x27;.

Stephen died of chronic renal failure on 11 March 1894 at Red House Park, a nursing home near Ipswich, and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London. His wife survived him.

=== Honours ===
Stephen was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI) in January 1877. He was created a Baronet, of De Vere Gardens in the parish of Saint Mary Abbott, Kensington, in the County of London, on 29 June 1891, shortly after his resignation from the bench. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a corresponding member of the Institut de France (1888). He received honorary doctorates from the University of Oxford (1878) and the University of Edinburgh University (1884), and was elected an honorary fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge (1885).

== Legacy ==
Criminal appeal was discussed and an Act passed in 1907; otherwise nothing has been done in the UK with either part of the draft code since. The historical materials which Stephen had long been collecting took permanent shape in 1883 as his &quot;History of the Criminal Law of England&quot;. He lacked time for a planned &quot;Digest of the Law of Contract&quot; (which would have been much fuller than the Indian Code). Thus none of Stephen&#x27;s own plans of English codification took effect. The Parliament of Canada used a version of Stephen&#x27;s Draft Bill revised and augmented by George Burbidge, at the time Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada, to codify its criminal law in 1892 as the &quot;Criminal Code, 1892&quot;. New Zealand followed with the &quot;New Zealand Criminal Code Act 1893&quot; and a number of Australian colonies adopted their own versions as Criminal Codes in following years

His book &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot; was called the &quot;finest exposition of conservative thought in the latter half of the 19th century&quot; by Ernest Barker. It was listed as one of Ten Conservative Books to read in the chapter of that name in &quot;The Politics of Prudence&quot; by Russell Kirk. According to Princeton University political theorist Greg Conti, Stephen&#x27;s political thought had liberal characteristics, even though he has frequently been characterized as conservative or religious authoritarian. According to Conti, Stephen &quot;articulated robustly both technocratic and pluralistic visions of politics. Perhaps more stridently than any Victorian, he put forward an argument for the necessity and legitimacy of expert rule against claims for popular government. Yet he also insisted on the plurality of perspectives on public affairs and on the ineluctable conflict between them.&quot;

The 1957 Wolfenden report recommended the decriminalisation of homosexuality and this sparked off the Hart-Devlin debate on the relationship between politics and morals. Lord Devlin&#x27;s 1959 critique of the Wolfenden report (titled &quot;The Enforcement of Morals&quot;) resembled Stephen&#x27;s arguments, although Devlin had arrived at his opinions independently, having never read &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot;. Hart claimed that &quot;though a century divides these two legal writers, the similarity in the general tone and sometimes in the detail of their arguments is very great&quot;. Afterwards, Devlin tried to obtain a copy of &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot; from his local library but could only do so with &quot;great difficulty&quot;; the copy, when it arrived, was &quot;held together with an elastic band&quot;. Hart, an opponent of Stephen&#x27;s views, regarded &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot; as &quot;sombre and impressive&quot;.

An eleven-volume set of his collected writings (2013 - ) is currently being prepared for Oxford University Press by the Editorial Institute at Boston University.

==Quotations==
On capital punishment: 
&quot;Some men, probably, abstain from murder because they fear that, if they committed murder, they would be hung. Hundreds of thousands abstain from it because they regard it with horror. One great reason why they regard it with horror is, that murderers are hung with the hearty approbation of all reasonable men&quot;.On evidence obtained by duress or torture:&quot;It is far pleasanter to sit comfortably in the shade rubbing red pepper in some poor devil&#x27;s eyes, than to go about in the sun hunting up evidence.&quot;

<text>James Stephen (30 June 1758 – 10 October 1832) was the principal English lawyer associated with the movement for the abolition of slavery. Stephen was born in Poole, Dorset; the family home later being removed to Stoke Newington. He married twice and was the father of Sir James Stephen, grandfather of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen and Sir Leslie Stephen, and great-grandfather of Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell.

==Early life==
James Stephen was born to James Stephen and Sibella Stephen (née Milner). He began his career reporting on parliamentary proceedings for the &quot;Morning Post&quot;. He was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1775 and was called to the bar there in 1782. His father had earlier been a member of the Middle Temple but was expelled before being called to the bar. James also read law at Marischal College, Aberdeen, for two years but ended his studies due to a lack of money. The following year he sailed with his family to the West Indies, where they would live for the next 11 years.

Stephen set up in practice as a lawyer there, becoming solicitor-general of St. Kitts, at that time a British colony. During a visit to Barbados, he witnessed the trial of four black slaves for murder. The trial, which found the men guilty as charged, was considered by many to be a grave miscarriage of justice. The men were sentenced to death by burning, and Stephens&#x27; revulsion at both the trial and the verdict led him to vow never to keep slaves himself, and to ally himself with the abolitionist movement. Stephen opposed the opening up of Trinidad through the use of slave labour when the island was ceded to the British in 1797, recommending instead that Crown land should only be granted for estates that supported the immigration of free Africans. He considered that, besides the evangelical arguments in support of freedom from slavery, internal security, particularly from potential French interests, could be obtained in the British West Indian islands by improving the conditions of slaves.

Stephen was a skilled lawyer whose speciality was the laws governing Great Britain&#x27;s foreign trade. He was a defender of the mercantilist system of government-licensed controlled trade. In October 1805 – the same month that the British fleet under Lord Nelson defeated the French fleet – his book appeared: &quot;War in Disguise; or, the Frauds of the Neutral Flags&quot;. It called for the abolition of neutral nations&#x27; carrying trade, meaning America&#x27;s carrying trade, between France&#x27;s Caribbean islands and Europe, including Great Britain. Stephen&#x27;s arguments two years later became the basis of Great Britain&#x27;s Orders in Council, which placed restrictions on American vessels. The enforcement of this law by British warships eventually led to the War of 1812, even though the Orders were repealed in the same month that America declared war, unbeknown to the American Congress.

==Abolitionism==
Stephen&#x27;s second marriage was to Sarah, sister of William Wilberforce, in 1800, and through this connection he became frequently acquainted with many of the figures in the anti-slavery movement. Several of his friendships among the abolitionists were made in Clapham (home to the Clapham Sect) where he had moved from Sloane Square in 1797. Other connections were formed also in the village of Stoke Newington a few miles north of London, where Stephen&#x27;s father leased a family home from 1774 onwards called Summerhouse. The property adjoined Fleetwood House and Abney House at Abney Park and stood where Summerhouse Road is built today. Close by were the residences of three prominent Quaker abolitionists: William Allen (1770–1843), Joseph Woods the elder, and Samuel Hoare Jr (1751–1825). The latter two were founder members of the predecessor body to the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade.

Anna Letitia Barbauld, author of &quot;An Epistle to William Wilberforce&quot; (1791), also came to live in Stoke Newington in 1802. Inevitably, Wilberforce also became a frequent visitor to Stoke Newington, combining meetings with William Allen and his Quaker circle with visits to his sister Sarah and brother-in-law James.

Stephen came to be regarded as the chief architect of the Slave Trade Act 1807, providing Wilberforce with the legal mastermind he needed for its drafting. To close off loopholes pointed out by some critics, he became a Director of the Africa Institution for the Registration of Slaves through which he advocated a centralised registry, administered by the British government, which would furnish precise statistics on all slave births, deaths, and sale, so that &quot;any unregistered black would be presumed free&quot;. Though he introduced many successful ideas to strengthen the legal success of the abolitionist cause, this mechanism which he believed to be &quot;the only effective means to prevent British colonists from illicitly importing African slaves&quot; was never taken up. His last public engagement was a speaking engagement at a meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society at Exeter Hall in 1832.

==Member of Parliament==
From 1808 to 1815 James Stephen became an MP, firstly for Tralee and afterwards for East Grinstead and in 1811 Master in Chancery. His want of education and his fiery temper prevented him from doing justice to considerable natural powers of eloquence. In 1826 he issued &quot;An Address to the People and Electors of England&quot;, in which, echoing his speeches, he had some success in urging the election of members of parliament who would not be &quot;tools of the West India interest&quot;, paving the way for the second Abolition Bill which succeeded in 1833.

==Family==
Three sons from Stephen&#x27;s first marriage, to Anna Stent at St Leonard&#x27;s, Shoreditch in 1783, survived him, and achieved prominence in law, abolition and the civil service: Sir James Stephen (1789–1859), Henry John Stephen (1787–1864), and Sir George Stephen (1794–1879).

Stephen&#x27;s second wife was Sarah Wilberforce (c. 1757–1816), eldest sister of William Wilberforce (1759–1833); Barbara Wilberforce (1799–1821) was her niece and daughter of William. In 1832 Stephen died, and all three were buried at St Mary&#x27;s churchyard, Stoke Newington, London, along with Stephen&#x27;s first wife, his mother and father and two of his infant daughters.

The Stephens were connected to the Australian legal dynasty of that name.

<doc id="197406" wikidata="Q181733" url="?curid=197406" title="Praetorian Guard">
<text>The Praetorian Guard (Latin: &quot;cohortes praetoriae&quot;) was the imperial guard of the Imperial Roman army that served various roles for the Roman emperor including being a bodyguard unit, counterintelligence, crowd control and gathering military intelligence.

During the Roman Republic, the Praetorian Guards were escorts for high-ranking political officials (senators and procurators) and were bodyguards for the senior officers of the Roman legions. In 27 BC, after Rome&#x27;s transition from republic to empire, the first emperor of Rome, Augustus, designated the Praetorians as his personal security escort. For three centuries, the guards of the Roman emperor were also known for their palace intrigues, by whose influence upon imperial politics the Praetorians could overthrow an emperor and then proclaim his successor as the new &quot;caesar&quot; of Rome. In AD 312, Constantine the Great disbanded the and destroyed their barracks at the Castra Praetoria.

== In the Roman Republic ==
In the period of the Roman Republic (509–27 BC) the Praetorian Guard originated as bodyguards for Roman generals. The first historical record of the praetorians is as bodyguards for the Scipio family, ca. 275 BC. Generals with (command authority of an army) also held public office, either as a magistrate or as a promagistrate; each was provided with lictors to protect the person of the office-holder. In practice, the offices of Roman consul and of proconsul each had twelve lictors, whilst the offices of praetor and of propraetor each had six lictors. In the absence of an assigned, permanent personal bodyguard, senior field officers safeguarded themselves with temporary bodyguard units of selected soldiers. In Hispania Citerior, during the Siege of Numantia (134–133 BC), General Scipio Aemilianus safeguarded himself with a troop of 500 soldiers against the sorties of siege warfare aimed at killing Roman field commanders.

At the end of 40 BC, two of the three co-rulers who were the Second Triumvirate, Octavian and Mark Antony, had Praetorian Guards. Octavian installed his praetorians within the , the religious and legal boundary of Rome; this was the first occasion when troops were permanently garrisoned in Rome proper. In the Orient, Antony commanded three cohorts; in 32 BC, Antony issued coins honouring his Praetorian Guard. According to the historian Orosius, Octavian commanded five cohorts at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC; in the aftermath of Roman civil war, the victorious Octavian then merged his forces with the forces of Antony as symbolic of their political reunification. Later, as Augustus, the first Roman emperor (27 BC–AD 14), Octavian retained the Praetorians as his imperial bodyguard. In the longer campaigns of the Roman army of the late Republic, the personal bodyguard unit was the norm for a commander in the field. At camp, the , a cohort of praetorians guarding the commander, was posted near the , the tent of the commander.

== Under the empire ==

The legionaries known as the Praetorian Guard were first hand-picked veterans of the Roman army who served as bodyguards to the emperor. First established by Augustus, members of the Guard accompanied him on active campaign, protecting the civic administrations and rule of law imposed by the Senate and the emperor. The Praetorian Guard was ultimately dissolved by Emperor Constantine I in the early 4th century. They were distinct from the Imperial German Bodyguard which provided close personal protection for the early Roman emperors. They benefited from several advantages via their close proximity with the emperor: the Praetorians were the only ones admitted while bearing arms in the center of sacred Rome, the . 

Their mandatory service was shorter in duration, for instance: 12 years with the Praetorians instead of 16 years in the legions starting year 13 BC, then carried to, respectively, 16 to 20 years in year 5 BC according to Tacitus. Their pay was higher than that of a legionary. Under Nero, the pay of a Praetorian was three and a half times that of a legionary, augmented by prime additions of , granted by each new emperor. This additional pay was the equivalent of several years of pay and was often repeated at important events of the empire or events that touched the imperial family: birthdays, births and marriages. Major monetary distributions or food subsidies renewed and compensated the fidelity of the Praetorians following each failed particular attempted plot (such as that of Messalina against Claudius in AD 48 or Piso against Nero in AD 65). The Praetorians received substantially higher pay than other Roman soldiers in any of the legions, on a system known as , or by pay-and-a-half. So if the legionaries received 250 denarii, the guards received 375 per annum. Domitian and Septimius Severus increased the (payment) to 1,500 denarii per year, distributed in January, May and September.

Feared and dreaded by the population and by the Roman Senate, the Praetorians received no sympathy from the Roman people. A famous poem by Juvenal recalls the nail left in his foot by the sandal of a Praetorian rushing by him. &quot;Praetorian&quot; has a pejorative sense in French, recalling the often troubling role of the Praetorian of antiquity.

=== History ===
In ancient Rome, &quot;praetors&quot; were either civic or military leaders. The praetorians were initially elite guards for military praetors, under the republic. The early Praetorian Guard was very different from what it became later, as a vital force in the power politics of Rome. While Augustus understood the need to have a protector in the maelstrom of Rome, he was careful to uphold the Republican veneer of his regime. Thus, he allowed only nine cohorts to be formed, each originally consisting of 500 men. He then increased them to 1,000 men each, allowing three units to be on duty at any given time in the capital. A small number of detached cavalry units () of 30 men each were also organized. While they patrolled inconspicuously in the palace and major buildings, the others were stationed in the towns surrounding Rome. This system was not radically changed with the appointment by Augustus in 2 BC of two Praetorian prefects, Quintus Ostorius Scapula and Publius Salvius Aper, although organization and command were enhanced. Tacitus reports that the number of cohorts was increased to twelve from nine in AD 47. In AD 69 it was briefly increased to sixteen cohorts by Vitellius, but Vespasian quickly reduced it again to nine.

==== Under the Julio-Claudian dynasty ====
In Rome, the guards&#x27; principal duty was to mount the Guard at the house of Augustus on the Palatine, where the centuries and the turmae of the cohort in service mounted the guard outside the emperor&#x27;s palace (the interior guard of the palace was mounted by the Imperial German Bodyguard, often also referred to as &quot;Batavi&quot;, and the Augusti, a sort of military police which were found in the general staff headquarters of the Roman Army). Every afternoon, the would receive the password from the emperor personally. The command of this cohort was assumed directly by the emperor and not by the Praetorian prefect. After the construction of the Praetorian camp in 23 BC, another similar serving tribune was placed in the Praetorian camp. The guards&#x27; functions included, among many, escorting the emperor and the members of the imperial family and, if necessary, to act as a sort of riot police. Certain Empresses exclusively commanded their own Praetorian Guard.

According to Tacitus, in the year 23 BC, there were nine Praetorian cohorts (4,500 men, the equivalent of a legion) to maintain peace in Italy; three were stationed in Rome, and the others nearby.

According to Boris Rankov in 1994, an inscription recently discovered suggested that, towards the end of the reign of Augustus, the number of cohorts increased to 12 during a brief period. This inscription referred to one man who was the tribune of two successive cohorts: the eleventh cohort, apparently at the end of the reign of Augustus, and the fourth at the beginning of the reign of Tiberius. According to Tacitus, there were only nine cohorts in 23 AD. The three urban cohorts, which were numbered consecutively after the Praetorian cohorts, were removed near the end of the reign of Augustus; it seemed probable that the last three Praetorian cohorts were simply renamed as urban cohorts.

The Praetorians first intervened on a battlefield since the wars of the end of the Republic during the &quot;mutinies of Pannonia&quot; and the &quot;mutinies of Germania&quot;. On the death of Augustus in AD 14, his successor Tiberius was confronted by mutinies in the two armies of the &quot;Rhine&quot; and &quot;Pannonia&quot;, who were protesting about their conditions of service being worse than the Praetorians. The forces of Pannonia were dealt with by Drusus Julius Caesar, son of Tiberius (distinct from Nero Claudius Drusus, brother of Tiberius), accompanied by two Praetorian cohorts, the Praetorian Cavalry, and Imperial German Bodyguards. The mutiny in Germania was repressed by the nephew and designated heir of Tiberius, Germanicus, who later led legions and detachments of the Guard in a two-year campaign in Germania, and succeeded in recovering two of the three legionary eagles which had been lost at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.

Sejanus rose in power under Tiberius, and was among the first prefects to exploit his position to pursue his own ambitions. He concentrated under his command all the Praetorian cohorts in the new camp. Sejanus held the title of prefect jointly with his father, under Augustus, but became sole prefect in AD 15, and used the position to render himself essential to the new emperor Tiberius, who was unable to persuade the Senate to share the responsibility of governing the Empire. Sejanus, however, alienated Drusus, son of Tiberius, and when Germanicus, the heir to the throne, died in AD 19 he was worried that Drusus would become the new emperor. Accordingly, he poisoned Drusus with the help of the latter&#x27;s wife, and immediately launched a ruthless elimination program against all competitors, persuading Tiberius to make him his heir apparent. He almost succeeded, but his plot was discovered and revealed in AD 31, and Tiberius had him killed by the , who were not under Sejanus&#x27;s control.

In AD 37 Caligula became emperor with the support of Naevius Sutorius Macro, Sejanus&#x27; successor as prefect of the Praetorian Guard. Under Caligula, whose reign lasted until AD 41, the overall strength of the Guard increased from 9 to 12 Praetorian cohorts.

In year 41, disgust and hostility of a praetorian tribune, named Cassius Chaerea – whom Caligula teased without mercy due to his squeaky voice – led to the assassination of the emperor by officers of the guard. While the Imperial German Bodyguard sacked all in a search to apprehend the murderers, the Senate proclaimed the restoration of a Republic. The Praetorians, who were pillaging the Palace, discovered Claudius, uncle of Caligula, hidden behind a curtain. Needing an emperor to justify their own existence, they brought him forth to the Praetorian camp and proclaimed him emperor, the first emperor proclaimed by the Praetorian Guard. He compensated the guard with a prime bonus worth five years their salary. The Praetorians accompanied Emperor Claudius to Britain in 43 AD.

When Claudius was poisoned, the Guard transferred their allegiance to Nero through the influence of his Praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus, who exercised a beneficial influence on the new emperor during the first eight years of his reign (Burrus died in 62 AD). Officers of the Guard, including one of the two successors of Burrus as the Praetorian prefect, participated in Piso&#x27;s conspiracy in year 65. The other Praetorian prefect, Tigellinus, headed the suppression of the conspiracy, and the members of the Guard were paid a bonus of 500 denarii each.

==== Year of the Four Emperors ====

In AD 68, the new colleague of Tigellinus, Nymphidius Sabinus, managed to have the Praetorian Guard abandon Nero in favor of the contender Galba. Nymphidius Sabinus had promised 7,500 denarii per man, but Galba refused to pay, saying &quot;It is my habit to recruit soldiers and not buy them&quot;. This permitted his rival Otho to bribe 23 Speculatores of the Praetorian Guard to proclaim him emperor. Despite the opposition of the cohorts in service in the palace, Galba and his designated successor, the young Piso, were lynched on .

After supporting Otho against a third contender, Vitellius, the Praetorians were restrained following defeat and their centurions executed. They were replaced by 16 cohorts recruited from the legionnaires and auxiliaries loyal to Vitellius, almost 16,000 men. These ex-Praetorians then aided Vespasian, the fourth Emperor, leading the attack against the Praetorian camp.

==== Flavian dynasty ====
Under the Flavians, the Praetorians formed 9 new cohorts, of which Titus, son of emperor Vespasian, became the prefect. Vespasian returned the effective strength of each unit to five hundred men. He also cancelled the guard service of the Praetorians at the entry to the emperor&#x27;s palace, but retained guards within the palace itself.

Under Vespasian&#x27;s second son, Domitian, the number of cohorts was increased to 10, and the Praetorian Guard participated in fighting in Germania and on the Danube against the Dacians. It was in the course of these actions that the prefect Cornelius Fuscus was defeated and killed in 86.

==== Antonine dynasty ====
Following assassination of Domitian in 96 the Praetorians demanded the execution of their prefect, Titus Petronius Secundus, who had been implicated in the murder. 

At the death of Nerva, at the beginning of 98, the Guard supported Trajan, commander of the Army of the Rhine, as new emperor. He executed the remaining Praetorian prefect and his partisans. Trajan returned to Rome from the Rhine, probably accompanied by the new unit of . The Praetorian Guard had participated in Trajan&#x27;s two Dacian Wars (101–102 and 105–106). The Praetorian Guard served in the last campaign of Trajan against the Parthians of 113–117.

During the 2nd century, the Praetorian Guard accompanied Lucius Verus in the Oriental War Campaign of 161–166 AD, and accompanied Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in his northern campaigns between 169–175 and 178–180. Two prefects were killed during these expeditions.

With the accession of Commodus, in 180, the Praetorian Guard returned to Rome. Tigidius Perennis (AD 182–185) and freedman Marcus Aurelius Cleander (AD 186–190) exercised considerable influence on the emperor. Perennis was killed by a delegation of 1,500 Lanciarii of the 3 legions of Britain which had come to complain about his interference in the affairs of the province. Cleander abused his influence to nominate and dismiss prefects.

In 188, Cleander obtained the joint command of the Guard with the two prefects. He ordered a massacre of civilians carried out by the , which led to an arranged battle with the Urban Cohorts.

==== Severan dynasty ====
Commodus fell victim to a conspiracy aided by his Praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus in 192. The new emperor Pertinax, who took part in the conspiracy, paid the Praetorians a premium of 3,000 denarii; however he was assassinated three months later, on , by a group of Guards due to his refusal to further increase the premium which had already been paid. The Praetorians then put the empire up to auction and Didius Julianus bought the title of emperor. However, the armies of the Danube chose instead the governor of Pannonia Superior, Septimius Severus, who besieged Rome and tricked the Praetorians when they came out unarmed. The Praetorian Guard was dissolved and replaced by men transferred from Septimius&#x27;s army.

The new Guard of Septimius Severus made their mark against his rival Clodius Albinus at the Battle of Lyon in 197, and accompanied the emperor to the Orient from 197 to 202, then to Britannia from 208 until his death at York in 211.

Caracalla, son of Septimius Severus, lost favour with his troops by assassinating his own brother and co-emperor, Geta, immediately after his succession. Finally, in 217, while on campaign in the Orient, he was assassinated at the instigation of his prefect Macrinus.

After the elimination of the latter, the Praetorians opposed the new emperor Elagabalus, priest of the oriental cult of Elagabal, and replaced him by his 13-year-old cousin Severus Alexander in 222.

In this period the position of Praetorian prefect in Italy came increasingly to resemble a general administrative post, and there was a tendency to appoint jurists such as Papinian, who occupied the post from 203 until his elimination and execution at the ascent of Caracalla. Under Severus Alexander the Praetorian prefecture was held by the lawyer Ulpian until his assassination by the Praetorian Guard in the presence of the emperor himself.

==== 3rd century ====
In the spring of 238, under Maximinus Thrax, the bulk of the Praetorian Guard was employed on active service. Defended by only a small residual garrison, the Praetorian camp was attacked by a civilian crowd acting in support of senators and Gordian emperors in revolt against Maximinus Thrax. The failure of Maximinus Thrax to win the civil war against the contenders Gordian I and Gordian II led to his death at the hands of his own troops, including the Praetorians. The senatorial candidates for the throne, Pupienus and Balbinus, recalled the Praetorian Guard to Rome, only to find themselves under attack by the Praetorians. Both were killed on and Gordian III triumphed.

After 238, literary and epigraphic sources dry up, and information on the Praetorian Guard becomes rare. In 249, the Praetorians assassinated Philippus II, son of the emperor Philip the Arab. In 272, in the reign of the emperor Aurelian, they took part in an expedition against Palmyra. In 284, Diocletian reduced the status of the Praetorians; they were no longer to be part of palace life, as Diocletian lived in Nicomedia, some 60 miles (100 km) from Byzantium in Asia Minor. Two new corps, the Ioviani and Herculiani (named after the gods Jove, or Jupiter, and Hercules, associated with the senior and junior emperor), replaced the Praetorians as the personal protectors of the emperors, a practice that remained intact with the Tetrarchy. In 297 they were in Africa with Maximian. By the time Diocletian retired on , their seems to have housed only a minor garrison of Rome.

==== Dissolution ====
During the early 4th century, &quot;Caesar&quot; Flavius Valerius Severus attempted to disband the Praetorian Guard on the orders of Galerius. In response, the Praetorians turned to Maxentius, the son of the retired emperor Maximian, and proclaimed him their emperor on . By 312, however, Constantine the Great marched on Rome with an army in order to eliminate Maxentius and gain control of the Western Roman Empire, leading to the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. Ultimately Constantine&#x27;s army achieved a decisive victory against the Praetorians, whose emperor was killed during the fighting. With the death of Maxentius, Constantine definitively disbanded the remnants of the Praetorian Guard. The remaining soldiers were sent out to various corners of the empire, and the was dismantled in a grand gesture, inaugurating a new age in Roman history and ending that of the Praetorians.

=== Participation in wars ===
While campaigning, the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman army. On the death of Augustus in 14 AD, his successor, Tiberius, was faced with mutinies among both the Rhine and Pannonian legions. According to Tacitus, the Pannonian forces were dealt with by Tiberius&#x27; son Drusus, accompanied by two Praetorian cohorts, the Praetorian cavalry and some of the German bodyguard. The German mutiny was put down by Tiberius&#x27; nephew and adopted son Germanicus, his intended heir, who then led the legions and detachments of the Guard in an invasion of Germany over the next two years. The Guard saw much action in the Year of the Four Emperors in 69, fighting well for Otho at the first battle of Bedriacum. Under Domitian and Trajan, the guard took part in wars from Dacia to Mesopotamia, while with Marcus Aurelius, years were spent on the Danubian frontier during the Marcomannic Wars. Throughout the 3rd century, the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns.

=== Political role ===
The Praetorian Guard influenced and intervened in the imperial succession to name the new , which was a political decision that the unarmed Senate accepted, ratified, and proclaimed to the people of Rome. After the death of Sejanus, who was sacrificed for the (imperial gift) promised by Tiberius, the Praetorians became exceptionally ambitious in their influence upon the politics of the Roman Empire. Either by volition or for a price, the Praetorian Guard would assassinate an emperor, bully the Praetorian prefects, or attack the Roman populace. In AD 41, conspirators from the senatorial class and from the Guard killed Emperor Caligula, his wife, and their daughter. Afterwards, the Praetorians installed Caligula&#x27;s uncle Claudius upon the imperial throne of Rome, and challenged the Senate to oppose the Praetorian decision.

In AD 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, after assassinating the Emperor Galba, because he did not offer them a , the Praetorians gave their allegiance to Otho, whom they named as the new of Rome. To ensure the loyalty of the Praetorian Guard, Emperor Otho granted the Praetorians the right to appoint their own prefects. After defeating Otho, Vitellius disbanded the Praetorians and established a new Guard composed of sixteen cohorts. In his war against Vitellius, Vespasian relied upon the disgruntled cohorts dismissed by Emperor Vitellius, and, as Emperor Vespasian, he reduced the Praetorian Guard to nine cohorts and ensured their political loyalty by appointing his son, Titus, as prefect of the Praetorians.

Despite their political power, the Praetorian Guard had no formal role in governing the Roman Empire. Often after an outrageous act of violence, revenge by the new ruler was forthcoming. In 193, Didius Julianus purchased the Empire from the Guard for a vast sum, when the Guard auctioned it off after killing Pertinax. Later that year Septimius Severus marched into Rome, disbanded the Guard and started a new formation from his own Pannonian legions. Unruly mobs in Rome often fought with the Praetorians in vicious street battles during Maximinus Thrax&#x27;s reign.

In 271, Aurelian sailed east to destroy the power of Palmyra, Syria, with a force of legionary detachments, Praetorian cohorts, and other cavalry units, and easily defeated the Palmyrenes. This led to the orthodox view that Diocletian and his colleagues evolved the (the field escort of the emperors). The included field units that used a selection process and command structure modeled after the old Praetorian cohorts, but it was not of uniform composition and was much larger than a Praetorian cohort.

=== Organization ===
==== Leadership ====
Starting in the year 2 BC, the Praetorian prefect was the commanding officer of the Praetorian Guard (previously each cohort was independent and under the orders of a tribune of equestrian rank). This role (chief of all troops stationed in Rome), was in practice a key position of the Roman polity.

From Vespasian onwards the Praetorian prefecture was always held by an equestrian of the order. (&quot;Equestrians&quot; were traditionally that class of citizens who could equip themselves to serve in the Roman Army on horseback).

From the year 2 BC, the cohorts were under the control of two prefectures; however cohorts continued to be organized independently, each commanded by a tribune. Tribunes had as immediate subordinates ordinary Centurions, all of equal rank except for the , the first and prime of all centurions of the Praetorian Cohorts, who commanded also the 300 , and with the exception of his second, the &quot;princeps castrorum&quot;.

From the second century the Praetorian prefect oversaw not only the Praetorian Cohorts but also the rest of the garrison of Rome, including the (&quot;urban cohorts&quot;) and the , but not the &quot;Vigiles&quot; cohorts.

Following the dissolution of the Praetorian Cohorts by the emperor Constantine after he defeated them at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312, the role of the Praetorian prefect in the Empire became purely administrative, ruling large territories () comprising Roman dioceses (geographical subdivisions of the Roman Empire) in the name of the Emperor.

==== Size and composition ====
The Praetorian Cohorts were designated as (cavalry) &quot;Turmae&quot; (troops) with centuries formed of infantry, initially of 500 men each.

In order not to alienate the population of Rome, while conserving Republican civilian traditions, the Praetorians did not wear their armor while in the heart of the city. Instead they often wore a formal toga, which distinguished them from civilians but remained in a respectable civilian attire, the mark of a Roman citizen. Augustus, conscious of risking the only military force present in the city, often avoided concentrating them and imposed this dress code.

From the reign of Tiberius, their camp was situated on the Quirinal Hill, outside Rome. In 26 AD, Sejanus, Praetorian prefect, and the favorite of emperor Tiberius, united the Urban Cohorts with nine Praetorian Cohorts, dispersed at that time throughout Italy, in one large camp situated beyond the Servian Wall, on the Esquiline Hill, the .

For the 2nd century, calculations from lists of significant demobilisations suggest an increase in size to nearly 1,500 men per cohort (perhaps a doubling of 800 (since Vespasian), probably organized in 20 centuries) under Commodus in year (187–188) or under Septimius Severus (193–211), which matches the probable numbers of effectives for Urban Cohorts during the time of Cassius Dio. These figures suggest an overall size for the Guard of 4,500–6,000 men under Augustus, 12,800 under Vitellius, 7,200 under Vespasian, 8,000 from Domitian until Commodus or Septimius Severus, and 15,000 later on.

At the beginning of the 2nd century, Italians made up 89% of the Praetorian Guard. Under Septimius Severus, recruitment evolved to authorize the inclusion of legionaries of the Roman army, as well as of the battle hardened &quot;Army of the Danube&quot;. Severus stationed his supporters with him in Rome, and the Praetorian Guards remained loyal to his choices.

==== Praetorian Cavalry ====
Initially each cohort included, as for a Roman legion, a cavalry detachment; this should not be confused with the who appeared under the emperor Trajan. The Praetorian could become a cavalryman () after almost five years service in the infantry. These Praetorians remained listed in their Centuries of origin, but operated in a of 30 men each commanded by an .

There was probably one of cavalry for two centuries of infantry. Hence, three per cohorts of the &quot;Augustan period&quot;, five per cohort in 100 CE–200 CE, and ten per cohort after 200 CE, with a (flag) as emblem for each .

==== Speculatores Augusti ====
The were cavalrymen assigned to the same tasks as the of the legions and the auxiliary units (messengers in charge of transmitting intelligence, and clandestine agents).

About 300 in total (30 per cohort), they formed a unit under the orders of the senior Centurion, the . Selected for their impressive physique, they were used by the Emperor for clandestine operations and tasks such as arrests, imprisonment, and executions.

One of their roles was to accompany the emperor on his foreign campaign journeys (a role which would later be handled by the ). Claudius was in the habit of surrounding himself with when attending dinners.

The close security protection detail of Galba, of Otho and the dynastic line of the Flavians appear to have been formed of (who replaced the Imperial German Bodyguard disbanded by Galba).

Following the assassination of emperor Domitian, his successor Nerva was placed under the protection of Trajan, to counter possible revenge attempts and mutinies. Trajan was commander of the most important army of the time, that of the Army of Germania, and he nominated him as his heir. Accordingly, and following such an act, Trajan, aiming to reinforce his security detail in relation to the who had remained loyal to Domitian, replaced them as close protection security detail with the (modelled on the of a provincial governor, a post held by Trajan). The some 300 were reassigned by Trajan to the corps of Praetorian cohorts.

They were distinguished by a special (but unknown) style of boots, the (according to Suetonius) and they received special honorific diplomas in bronze at demobilization. They had their own Equestrian instructors ().

=== Service in the Praetorian Guard ===
Originally, the Praetorian Guard was recruited from the populations of central Italy (Etruria, Umbria and Latium according to Tacitus). Recruits were between 15 and 32 years of age, compared to legionary recruits who ranged from 18 to 23 years of age. According to Cassius Dio, during the first two centuries AD and before the reform of Septimius Severus, the Praetorians were exclusively limited to Italy, Spain (Roman province), Macedonia and Noricum (current Austria).

Under the reign of Vitellius, and starting from Septimius Severus, men were transferred from the Urban Vigiles, Urban cohorts, and the various legions. This recent method and manner of recruitment at the corps of the legions became the normal procedure to recruit in the 3rd century after Septimius Severus dealt with the undisciplined Praetorians who assassinated Pertinax in 193, and replaced them with men from his own Danube legions.

At that time, the Praetorians represented the best soldiers from the legions (principally from Illyria). They were a group of elite of soldiers starting from the 3rd century, and not a category of socially privileged soldiers (such as the Italians at the time of Augustus). The Italians formed the base of the recruitment of the , a new legion created and stationed in Italy.

To be admitted to the Guard, a man had to be in good physical condition, have a good moral character, and come from a respectable family. In addition, he had to make use of all sorts of patronages available to him in order to obtain letters of recommendations from important leading figures in society. Once past the recruitment procedure he was designated as , and assigned as a (soldier) to one of the centuries of a cohort. After two years, if he attracted the attention of his superiors by influence or merit, he could attain the post of (similar to corporal), perhaps as a (junior chief) at general headquarters or as a technician. This promotion exempted him from daily chores. After another two years he could be promoted to , with a double salary, in charge of delivering messages () or as an assistant centurion () or standard bearer () at the corps of the century; or, if literate and numerate, he could join the administrative staff of the prefect.

Only a few soldiers could attain the rank of ; however those who did, during the course of their service, were designated by the emperor. This designation allowed them to be promoted to technical administrative posts, or instructors in Rome, or to a century in a legion, and accordingly extend their career. Certain could at the end of their career be promoted to Centurion in the Guard; this would be the peak of his career. Anyone ambitious for further promotion would need to transfer to a legion.

The Military tribunes () at the head of the cohorts were Roman cavalrymen. In contrast to many superior cadres of the Army, who originated from the Equestrian Order, these tribunes started their career in the ranks of the Guard and were promoted from the ranks in the hierarchy. Next after becoming Centurions, they had to serve for a period of one year as superior centurions in one or several legions before achieving the status of (the highest ranked Centurion in a legion). Upon return to Rome, they occupied successively the positions of Tribunes of the Vigiles, Tribune of the Urban Cohort and finally Tribune of the Guard.

Other leading paths towards the tribunate were possible, including service entirely made in the legions, attaining the rank of before departing to Rome. Nevertheless, all tribunes were combat veterans with extensive military experience. Each tribune served in Rome for one year, following which, a certain number of the men would retire.

A few of them, ranking placement at the top of the hierarchy, could obtain a second term as and advance towards the superior echelons of the equestrian career, possibly becoming the Praetorian prefect.

The majority of the prefects, however, were ordinary men of the equestrian rank by birth. The men who attained the command of the Guard following year 2 BC were equites with an elevated seniority, classifying right behind the prefect of Egypt. Starting from Vespasian, whose son, Titus was himself a Praetorian prefect, they were ranked first.

=== Equipment and traditions ===
The Praetorian Guard, like all legionnaires, disposed of various equipment to execute different missions. More particularly as bodyguard, escort or reserve military force, they housed adaptable equipment for each function.
For heavy packed combat infantry lines (Triplex Acies System), they mounted helmets, armor (Lorica segmentata, Lorica hamata, Lorica squamata specially in the 2nd and 3rd centuries), heavy colorful shields (scuta), heavy javelins (pila), and later even long spears and lighter javelins (hasta, lancea).

Praetorian Guard helmets included tall Galea with elaborate detail worked into the metal. Shields were ovoid and more robust compared with the regular rectangular shape sometimes used by the legions. Each legion had its own emblem displayed on its Scutum (shield) and the Praetorian Guard were probably the only unit to include additional insignia on their shields. Each cohort had their own version of Praetorian insignia. Praetorian Guard units could wear lion skin capes and their colours were so decorated with awards, that the men had difficulty in carrying them on long marches.

The Praetorian Guard colours included the winged goddess of victory.

For escorts, the oval shields and lances replaced the scuta and pila. Missions in Rome at the heart of the city in principle were forbidden to soldiers, so they wore a toga.

The Praetorian Guard, like all legionaries, shared similar insignia, mainly on their shields. Praetorian Guard shields included wings and thunderbolts, referring to Jupiter, and also uniquely included scorpions, stars and crescents.

<text>The red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) is a passerine bird of the family Icteridae found in most of North America and much of Central America. It breeds from Alaska and Newfoundland south to Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, and Guatemala, with isolated populations in western El Salvador, northwestern Honduras, and northwestern Costa Rica. It may winter as far north as Pennsylvania and British Columbia, but northern populations are generally migratory, moving south to Mexico and the Southern United States. Claims have been made that it is the most abundant living land bird in North America, as bird-counting censuses of wintering red-winged blackbirds sometimes show that loose flocks can number in excess of a million birds per flock and the full number of breeding pairs across North and Central America may exceed 250 million in peak years. It also ranks among the best-studied wild bird species in the world. The red-winged blackbird is sexually dimorphic; the male is all black with a red shoulder and yellow wing bar, while the female is a nondescript dark brown. Seeds and insects make up the bulk of the red-winged blackbird&#x27;s diet.

==Taxonomy==
The red-winged blackbird is one of five species in the genus &quot;Agelaius&quot; and is included in the family Icteridae, which is made up of passerine birds found in North and South America. The red-winged blackbird was formally described as &quot;Oriolus phoeniceus&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, but was later moved with the other American blackbirds to the genus &quot;Agelaius&quot; by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. Linnaeus specified the type location as &quot;America&quot; but this was restricted to Charleston, South Carolina in 1928. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek , meaning &quot;gregarious&quot;. The specific epithet, , is Latin meaning &quot;crimson&quot; or &quot;red&quot;. The red-winged blackbird is a sister species to the red-shouldered blackbird (&quot;Agelaius assimilis&quot;) that is endemic to Cuba. These two species are together sister to the tricolored blackbird (&quot;Agelaius tricolor&quot;) that is found on the Pacific coast region of the California and upper Baja California in Mexico.

Depending on the authority, between 20 and 24 subspecies are recognised which are mostly quite similar in appearance. However, there are two isolated populations of bicolored blackbirds that are quite distinctive: &quot;A. p. californicus&quot; of California and &quot;A. p. gubernator&quot; of central Mexico. The taxonomy and relationships between these two populations and with red-winged blackbirds is still unclear. Despite the similarities in most forms of the red-winged blackbird, in the subspecies of Mexican Plateau, &quot;A. p. gubernator&quot;, the female&#x27;s veining is greatly reduced and restricted to the throat; the rest of the plumage is very dark brown, and also in a different family from the European redwing and the Old World common blackbird, which are thrushes (Turdidae). In the California subspecies, &quot;A. p. californicus&quot; and &quot;A. p. mailliardorum&quot;, the veining of the female specimens also covers a smaller surface and the plumage is dark brown, although not in the &quot;gubernator&quot; grade; and also its superciliary list is absent or poorly developed. The male subspecies &quot;mailliardorum&quot;, &quot;californicus&quot;, &quot;aciculatus&quot;, &quot;neutralis&quot;, and &quot;gubernator&quot; lack the yellow band on the wing that is present in most male members of the other subspecies. The red-shouldered blackbird was formerly considered as a subspecies of red-winged blackbird. They were split by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1997.

==Description==

The common name for the red-winged blackbird is taken from the mainly black adult male&#x27;s distinctive red shoulder patches, or &quot;epaulets&quot;, which are visible when the bird is flying or displaying. At rest, the male also shows a pale yellow wingbar. The spots of males less than one year old, generally subordinate, are smaller and more orange than those of adults. The female is blackish-brown and paler below. The female is smaller than the male, at long and weighing , against his length of and weight of . The smallest females may weigh as little as whereas the largest males can weigh up to . Each wing can range from , the tail measures , the culmen measures and the tarsus measures . The upper parts of the female are brown, while the lower parts are covered by an intense white and dark veining; also presents a whitish superciliary list. According to Crawford (1977), females exhibit a salmon-pink stain on the shoulders and a light pink color on the face and below this when they are a year old, while older females show a stain usually more crimson on the shoulders and a darker pink hue on and under the face. Observations in females in captivity indicate that small amounts of yellow pigment are present on the shoulders of these after leaving the nest, that the concentration of the pigment increases with the first winter plumage after the change of the feathers and that the passage from yellow to orange generally takes place in the second summer with the acquisition of the second winter plumage, after which no further changes in feather color occur. The colored area on the wing increases in surface with the age of the female, and varies in intensity from brown to a bright red-orange similar to that of the males in their first year.

Young birds resemble the female, but are paler below and have buff feather fringes. Both sexes have a sharply pointed bill. The tail is of medium length and is rounded. The eyes, bill, and feet are all black. Unlike most North American passerines which develop their adult plumage in their first year of life so that the one-year-old and the oldest individual are indistinguishable in the breeding season, the red-winged blackbird does not. It acquires its adult plumage only after the breeding season of the year following its birth when it is between thirteen and fifteen months of age. Young males go through a transition stage in which the wing spots have an orange coloration before acquiring the most intense tone typical of adults.

The male measures between in length, while the female measures . Its wingspan is between approximately. Both the peak male and the legs, the claws and the eyes are black; in the female beak is dark brown and clear in the upper half at the bottom, and the tail is medium in length and rounded. As in other species polygyny exists, the red-winged blackbird exhibit considerable sexual dimorphism both in plumage and size, males weighing between 65 and 80g the females about 35g. Males are 50% heavier than females, 20% larger in its linear dimensions, and 20% larger compared to the length of their wings. The trend towards greater dimorphism in the size of non-monogamous ichterid species indicates that the larger size of males has evolved due to sexual selection.

The male is unmistakable except in the far west of the US, where the tricolored blackbird occurs. Males of that species have a darker red epaulet edged with white, not yellow. Females of tricolored, bicolored, red-shouldered and red-winged blackbirds can be difficult to identify in areas where more than one form occurs. In flight, when the field marks are not easily seen, the red-winged blackbird can be distinguished from less closely related icterids such as common grackle and brown-headed cowbird by its different silhouette and undulating flight.

===Staining of red spots and yellow bands===
Two keto-carotenoids – carotenoid with a ketone group – reds synthesized by the birds themselves – namely astaxanthin and canthaxanthin – are responsible for the bright red color of the wing spots, but two yellow dietary precursor pigments – lutein and zeaxanthin – are also present in moderately high concentrations in red feathers. Astaxanthin is the carotenoid more abundant (35% of the total), followed by lutein (28%), canthaxanthin (23%) and zeaxanthin (12%). Such a balanced combination of dietary precursors and metabolic derivatives in colored feathers is quite unusual, not only within a species as a whole but also in individuals and particular feathers.

After removing the carotenoids in an experiment, the red feathers acquired a deep brown coloration. This is because the feather barbles of the colored spot contain melanin pigments – mainly eumelanin, which was equivalent to 83% of all melanins, but also pheomelanin at a concentration approximately equal to that of carotenoids, which seems to be a rare trait for carotenoid-based ornamental plumage. On the other hand, the feathers of the yellow stripes of the males are devoid of carotenoids —except occasionally when they appear tinged with a pink coloration derived from small amounts of said pigments— and present high concentrations of pheomelanin —82% of all melanins. Melanin concentrations in the yellow band are even higher than in the red spot.

===Role of wing spots===
These markings are vital in the defense of the territory. Males with larger spots are more effective at chasing away their non-territorial rivals and are more successful in contests within aviaries. When the red shoulder patches were dyed black as part of an experiment, 64% of males lost their territories, while only 8% of control subjects did. However, males whose wings had been dyed before they had mated could still attract females and successfully reproduce. In the red-winged blackbird, the spots on the wings are a sign of threat among males and have an unimportant role, if any, in intersex encounters. Therefore, the spots are likely to have evolved in response to pressures linked to intrasexual selection. Additionally, neither the size nor the coloration of the same are linked to the reproductive success of the males with those females that are not their mates, that is, those with which they eventually mate. It has been suggested that also in the case of females, the best explanation for the evolution of a variable coloration in the shoulder spots is that their intensity indicates their physical condition in aggressive encounters between them.

The fact that female red-winged blackbirds do not appear to consistently use variability in the size and color of male wing spots when choosing a mate runs counter to the classic role of carotenoid pigmentation ornamental feathers, mostly used in the attraction of a couple. In turn, its use as a sign of aggressiveness and social status against rival males is not a common trait in carotenoid ornaments. On the other hand, ornaments with a preponderance of melanin do tend to have an important role as an indicator of status in avian populations, so the spots of red-winged blackbirds seem to work more as melanin ornaments than as carotenoids.

===Vocalizations===

The calls of the red-winged blackbird are a throaty &quot;check&quot; and a high slurred whistle, &#x27;. The male&#x27;s song, accompanied by a display of his red shoulder patches, is a scratchy &#x27;, except that in many western birds, including bicolored blackbirds, it is &#x27;. The female also sings, typically a scolding chatter &#x27;.

==Feather molt==
The most critical period of feather molting runs from late August to early September. When viewed in flight, they have a misaligned or &quot;moth-eaten&quot; appearance and generally slower and more laborious travel. Their mobility is reduced due to the lack of several remiges or rectrices or these are not entirely renewed. Most of the red-winged blackbirds have moved almost entirely by October. By then, some birds have not completed the molt of the feathers of the capital region and the helmsmen of the center of the tail and the internal secondary sprouts have only partially emerged from the pod. Virtually all individuals have completed their molts by mid-October.

Birds do not begin their migration to wintering quarters until the two outer primary sprouts and the two inner or central rectrices have completed at least two-thirds of their development. Therefore, there is a correlation between molting, particularly replacement of the remiges and rectrices, and fall migration in red-winged blackbirds.

===Succession of plumages and molts===
* Juvenile plumage: in both males and females, juvenile plumage is similar in color and pattern to that of the adult female, except for the yellow coloration of the lower body and the sides of the head . The shoulder spots appear mottled and are brown and yellow or brown and beige. Other sources describe the juvenile plumage of the male as follows: above, including the sides of the head, the wings, the tail and the lesser coverts – the feathers of the &quot;shoulders&quot; -, dull brownish black – not seen no red at this stage—, with beige-bordered feathers, paler and narrower in primaries, rectrices, head, and bladderand deeper in the scapulars and secondaries; below, pinkish beige, ocher above chin, densely veined — except chin — with brownish black stripes; undefined ocher-beige superciliary list. The female is described as more brown above with less beige below and a closely veined chin.
* First pre-basic molt (or post-juvenile molt): Generally begins 45–60 days after individuals have left the nest. The molt begins in August and the time at which it begins varies between early and late clutches. This is a complete molt, except for the retention in some individuals of a few down feathers under the wing.
* Appearance in autumn and winter of the first basic plumage (also called the first winter plumage or immature plumage): in the male, it is black, with the feathers of the upper part bordered with brown or beige and those of the lower part bordered with beige or white. The bird then has a mottled appearance. The shoulder spot is generally orange with black speckles, especially on the yellow stripe. Some immature males have a reddish patch like adults, but with black specks on the yellow band. Others have a blackish spot on the shoulder. Other sources describe the male&#x27;s first winter plumage as follows: all plumage, including wings and tail, greenish-black, much of it with beige and rust edges, paler underneath and faint or absent in primaries and rectrices; minor wing covers – &quot;shoulders&quot; – orpiment-dull orange, each feather with black subterminal bars or spots; medium beige, deep ocher coverts, generally mottled with black in subterminal areas, mainly in the beards of the inner part of the feathers; generally black spines.
:Females are dark above with feathers bordered with beige or rust. The lower part shows black and white streaks, but with more beige on the chest and sometimes on the flanks than in the reproductive plumage. The medium and secondary major cover feathers are noticeably bordered with beige. They generally lack the pink coloration on the chin and throat – which may be beige, yellow, or light salmon – and the crimson wing patch – which may be rust, orange, or gray – typical of second winter plumage.
* Appearance in spring and summer of the first basic plumage (also known as the first breeding plumage or sub-adult plumage): the males, which normally are not yet defending a territory, present a dull black coloration acquired by the wear of the edges of the feathers. The stain alar may be more noticeable than in the first winter plumage due to wear subterminal blacklists, which generally only remain in the form of small black spots. Mottled wing spots are characteristic of young individuals and the extent of orange is highly variable. Females, which are usually already breeding, exhibit plumage similar to the first winter plumage, but darker above due to wear on beige edges or rust on feathers. The chest is less beige, and has a black and white veining.
* Second and subsequent prebasic molts (or postnuptial molts) : the second prebasic molt takes place approximately one year after the first. Postnuptial molts constitute complete molts, except for the occasional retention of a few down feathers under the wing.
* Appearance in autumn and winter of the second and subsequent basic plumages (also called adult winter plumage or second winter plumage) : the male no longer exhibits the mottled appearance characteristic of the autumn and winter appearance of the first basic plumage. The lower part is almost immaculate and similar to that of the reproductive plumage. The head and back feathers and the secondary covers are bordered with brown and beige. The wing blot becomes bright scarlet-vermilion, while deep ocher beige coloration appears on the medium coats. Other sources describe the adult winter plumage of the male as follows: glossy greenish black; feathers of the head, back, major wing covers and tertiary more or less bordered, depending on the individual, beige and rust; below, paler or absent edges. The female&#x27;s plumage is similar to the autumn and winter appearance of the first basic plumage, except that the wing spot is generally crimson and the chin and throat pink.
* Aspect in summer and spring of the second and subsequent basic plumages (or adult bridal plumage): it is acquired through the wear of the feathers. is similar to the appearance in the spring and summer of the first basic plumage, but the alar spots of both sexes have a more intense color and chin and throat of the female. The beige and brown edges of the male feathers disappear.

Despite the fact that the brown or white tips on the feathers of the males are larger just after the molt and that they wear out throughout the year, the individuals vary considerably regarding the size of these non-black tips on the feathers in spring.

===Wing feathers===
Complete replacement of wing feathers takes about eight weeks. However, birds in their first year frequently retain some of the under-wing coverts and juvenile tertiary remiges after post-juvenile moulting. Of seventy immature males examined during the last week of October, it retained 70% of older lower primary blankets. In most cases where partial replacement of the covert feathers occurs, it is the proximal coverts that the bird retains.

===Remiges===
Primary remiges are one of the first feathers to molt. The molt of these feathers proceeds regularly from the innermost primary—primary I—to the outermost—primary IX. By October 1, most birds have either acquired the three new external primaries—VII, VIII, and IX—or they are at some advanced stage of development. The average dates for completion of the development of the new primary springs are: August 15 for primary I; September 1, primary II-IV; September 15, primary V and VI; and October 1, primaries VII-IX.

The molting of the secondary remiges begins with the most external—secondary I— and proceeds inward to secondary VI. The secondary I sheath appears around the same time that all the secondary covers have been replaced and rarely before mid-August. These feathers are not completely renewed until the beginning of October.

The molt of the tertiary remiges begins more or less at the same time as that of the secondary ones. The middle tertiary falls first, followed by the internal tertiary. Both feathers are often well developed again before the outer tertiary leaves the sheath.

===Cover feathers and alula===
The major primary blankets are changed along with their respective primary springs. Unlike the major primary coats, the major secondary coats molt earlier than the secondary spruces. The molting of these feathers is rapid, with several of them at the same stage of development simultaneously. The progression of the molt in these feathers is from the outside to the inside, as in the secondary remiges. Most birds has completed the change of the secondary coverts to August 15, more or less at the time is appreciable only secondary sheath remige I.

The molting of the lesser coverts begins early, often being the first feathers to fall. The onset of molting in male juveniles is particularly noticeable because it involves the replacement of the minor covers and results in the appearance of the reddish or orange wing spot. The new wing spot contrasts sharply with the yellowish-brown juvenile plumage in this area of the wing. The move of the minor blankets has generally been completed by September 1.

Alula feathers complete their development at about the same time as the last three primary sprouts. The marginal covers on the upper or outer surface of the forearm, located below the alula, shed at approximately the same time that the primary remix VI is being replaced.

The first feathers under the wing to molt are the marginal coverts, under the forearm. The shedding of these feathers begins at about the same time that the primary remix IV falls and is followed by that of the lower middle primary and lower middle secondary coats. The progression of the molting of the lower middle secondary blankets is from the outside to the inside, while that of the lower middle primary mats seems to be irregular or almost simultaneous. The medial lower coverts molt before the primary remiges VIII and IX. The major lower primary coverts and major lower secondary coverts molt last. The progression of the molting of these last feathers is the same as in the primary and secondary sprouts, that is, from the inside out and from the outside in, respectively.

===Flow and capital pens===
The caudal feathers comprise the rudder or rectrix feathers and the upper and lower tail covers. The tail covers begin to shed before the rectrices. Generally, the upper tail covers begin to shed first. Certain birds lose some rectrices by the end of the third week of August. The helmsmen in the center of the queue are the last rectrices to be renovated.

Molting in the capital region involves changing the feathers of the pileus and the sides of the head. It is one of the last parts of the body to begin feather replacement, but the renewal of most of the capital feathers is complete before that of the secondary feathers, tail feathers, and under-wing feathers. The beginning of the molt in this region coincides with the beginning of the development of the primary remige V or VI. Some individuals have already started replacing the capital feathers by mid-August. The molt begins at the pileus and the last areas of the capital region to complete it are the eye strip and the cheeks (malar region).

===Other pens===
In some birds, the first signs of molt in the ventral feathers appear during the last days of July, when the feathers of the anterior portion of the laterals begin to fall. From there, the molt progresses backward along the sides and forward toward the throat and chin. The last ventral feathers to be replaced are those towards the center of the abdomen. The molt of the dorsal feathers begins around the first week of August. It begins at the bladder, progresses to the upper back, and then to the cervical region.

The earliest evidence of molting in the humeral plumes corresponds to the last days of July. The molt comes from the anterior region backwards. The change of the femoral feathers begins later than that of the humeral ones. However, the progression is similar. Replacement of feather feathers rarely begins before August 15. The progression is generally from the proximal end of the tibia to the tarsometatarsal region.

==Distribution and habitat==

The red-winged blackbird is widely spread throughout North America, except in the arid desert, high mountain ranges, and arctic or dense afforestation regions. It breeds from central-eastern Alaska and Yukon in the northwest, and Newfoundland in the northeast, to northern Costa Rica in the south, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Northern populations migrate to the southern United States, but those that breed there, in Mexico, and in Central America are sedentary. Red-winged blackbirds in the northern reaches of the range are migratory, spending winters in the southern United States and Central America. Migration begins in September or October, but occasionally as early as August. In western and Central America, populations are generally non-migratory.

The red-winged blackbird inhabits open grassy areas. It generally prefers wetlands, and inhabits both freshwater and saltwater marshes, particularly if cattail is present. It is also found in dry upland areas, where it inhabits meadows, prairies, and old fields. In a large part of its distribution area, it constitutes the most abundant passerine bird in the swamps in which it nests. It is also present in areas without much water, where it inhabits open fields – often agricultural areas – and sparse deciduous forests.

In the winter of 1975–1976, near Milan in western Tennessee, red-winged blackbirds were observed resting in a mixed roost that came to house 11 million individuals in January and early February in a plantation of 4.5 hectares of yellow pine (Pinus taeda) with little undergrowth was seen in soybean fields during the day, being that these constituted only 21% of the habitat in the area and that the other bird species present in the roost were not commonly observed in these fields; they were also common in cornfields. the presences of the bird in feedlots has increased as winter progressed, but, accounting for less than 5% of the icterids and starlings recorded in both feedlots of cows and pigs, they were much rarer there than the brown-headed cowbird, common grackle and common starling.

===Preferences by habitat types during the breeding season===
During the breeding season, the density of breeding adults is much higher in swamps than in highland fields. Although the highest concentrations of nesting red-winged blackbird are found in swamps, most of them nest in upland habitats since they are much more abundant. In a study conducted in the Wood County, Ohio between 1964 and 1968, the density of territorial males in wetland habitat was found to be 2.89 times those in upland habitat. But, because of the small amount of wetland habitat, the total estimated upland population of territorial males
was 2.14 times the wetland population. Alfalfa (&quot;Medicago sativa&quot;) and other legume crops (hay) were the principal habitat for breeding redwings in the county. Despite the marked preference for wetland habitats, the greater population in uplands reflects wetlands&#x27; scarcity.

===Vegetation type preferences during the breeding season===
In that same study, reproductive individuals in upland habitats demonstrated a slight preference for old and new grasses such as &quot;Phleum pratense&quot;, &quot;Dactylis glomerata&quot;, &quot;Poa&quot; spp., &quot;Festuca&quot; spp., and &quot;Bromus&quot; spp. in the early part of the breeding season and new non-graminoid herbaceous plants in the mid and late season. In wetlands, they consistently preferred old and new broadleaf monocotyledons, primarily &quot;Carex&quot; spp, broadleaf, and &quot;Typha&quot; spp, and consistently rejected old and new narrow-leaved monocots, primarily narrow-leaved &quot;Phalaris arundinacea&quot; and &quot;Calamagrostis canadensis&quot;, and non-graminoid herbaceous plants. Red-winged blackbirds breeding in the highlands favored older tall vegetation only in the early part of the breeding season on April to May, and higher new vegetation and dense vegetation throughout the breeding season. For their part, those who settled in wetlands seemed to have a slight predilection for taller old vegetation. During the breeding season, this species is attracted to tall vegetation that restricts visibility.

Early season preferences for old grassland in the highlands and old broadleaf monocotyledons in wetlands point to the importance of upright residual vegetation. Highland grasses and broadleaf monocots in wetlands stand partially vertically and are easily visible in early spring, unlike clovers, narrow-leaved monocotyledons in wetlands and most non-graminoid herbaceous plants. Old alfalfa plants are also partially upright in early spring, but they are not as consistently chosen a species as old grasses. The start of the territorial activity is earlier when the amount of residual vegetation is large. Vegetation structural strength also appears to be important for nesting as females tend to broadleaf monocotyledons in wetlands throughout the breeding season and new non-graminoid herbaceous plants in the mid to late season.

In southwestern Michigan, the density of cattail stems in different ponds was positively related to the concentration of reproductive adults. However, other studies detected a predilection for more scattered vegetation. One found that red-winged blackbirds avoided the marsh wren (&quot;Pantaneros chivirenes&quot;), a predator common in nests of this species, reproducing among more dispersed vegetation, which was more easily defended from the chivirines; conversely, the chivirines seemed to prefer the denser vegetation, where they were more likely to avoid the aggressiveness of the red-winged blackbird; These differences in habitat selection between one species and another resulted in spatial segregation of their breeding areas. On the other hand, red-winged blackbirds tend to opt for small lots of vegetation and plants with thick stems.

==Behavior==
The red-winged blackbird is territorial, polygynous, gregarious and a short-distance migratory bird. Its way of flying is characteristic, with rapid wing flaps punctuated by brief periods of gliding flight. The behavior of males makes their presence easily perceived: they perch in high places such as trees, bushes, fences, telephone lines, etc. Females tend to stay low, prowling through the vegetation and building their nests. They can be found in home gardens, particularly during their migration, if seeds have been scattered on the ground. The forest curtains serve as a resting place during the day.

For several weeks after their first appearance in early spring, red-winged blackbirds are generally seen in flocks made up entirely of males. During those days, they are seldom seen at their breeding sites, except early morning and late afternoon. In most of the remaining hours of the day, they frequent open and often elevated agricultural land, where they feed mainly on grain stubble and grassy fields. When disturbed while eating, they fly to the nearest deciduous trees and immediately after landing they begin to sing.

===Food===
The red-winged blackbird is omnivorous. It feeds primarily on plant materials, including seeds from weeds and waste grain such as corn and rice, but about a quarter of its diet consists of insects and other small animals, and considerably more so during breeding season. It prefers insects, such as dragonflies, damselflies, butterflies, moths, and flies, but also consumes snails, frogs, eggs, carrion, worms, spiders and mollusks. The red-winged blackbird forages for insects by picking them from plants, or by catching them in flight. Sometimes insects are obtained by exploring the bases of aquatic plants with their small beaks, opening holes to reach the insects hidden inside. Aquatic insects, particularly emerging odonates, are of great importance in the diet of red-winged blackbirds that breed in swamps. These birds typically capture the odonates when the larvae climb up the stem of a plant from the water, get rid of their exuviae, and cling to the vegetation while their exoskeletons harden. The years of emergence of periodical cicadas provide an overabundant amount of food. According to Edward Howe Forbush, when red-winged blackbirds arrive north in the spring, they feed in the fields and meadows. Then, they follow the plows, collecting larvae, earthworms and caterpillars left exposed, and in case there is a plague of &quot;Paleacrita vernata&quot; caterpillars in a fruit orchard, these birds will fly a kilometer to get them for their chicks.

In season, red-winged blackbirds eat blueberries, blackberries, and other fruits. These birds can be lured to backyard bird feeders by bread and seed mixtures and suet. In late summer and in autumn, the red-winged blackbird will feed in open fields, mixed with grackles, cowbirds, and starlings in flocks which can number in the thousands. It feeds on corn while it is maturing; once the grain has hardened it is relatively safe from this bird, since its beak and digestive system are not adapted for the consumption of hard and whole corn grains, unlike the Common grackle, which has a longer and stronger beak. Studies of the stomachs of individuals of both sexes reveal that males consume higher proportions of crop grains, while females ingest a relatively larger amount of herb seeds and animal matter. In the winter of 1975–1976, near Milan, western Tennessee, corn and herb seeds were the main foods consumed by red-winged blackbird. Herbs whose seeds were commonly consumed were &quot;Sorghum halepense&quot;, &quot;Xanthium strumarium&quot;, &quot;Digitaria ischaemum&quot;, &quot;Sporobolus&quot; spp., &quot;Polygonum&quot; spp. and &quot;Amaranthus&quot; spp.

===Breeding===
The red-winged blackbird nests in loose colonies. The nest is built in cattails, rushes, grasses, sedge, or alder or willow bushes. The nest is constructed entirely by the female over the course of three to six days. It is a basket of grasses, sedge, and mosses, lined with mud, and bound to surrounding grasses or branches. It is located to above water.

A clutch consists of three or four, rarely five, eggs. Eggs are oval, smooth and slightly glossy, and measure . They are pale bluish green, marked with brown, purple, and/or black, with most markings around the larger end of the egg. These are incubated by the female alone, and hatch in 11 to 12 days. Red-winged blackbirds are hatched blind and naked, but are ready to leave the nest 11 to 14 days after hatching.

Red-winged blackbirds are polygynous, with territorial males defending up to 10 females. However, females frequently copulate with males other than their social mate and often lay clutches of mixed paternity. Pairs raise two or three clutches per season, in a new nest for each clutch.

The reproductive season of the red-winged blackbird extends approximately from the end of April to the end of July. On the other hand, in different states has been estimated that the period in which the active nests contained eggs lay between beginning in late April and early late August; and in northern Louisiana nests were found to harbor chicks from late April to late July. The peak of the nesting season (the time with the highest number of active nests) has been recorded between the first half of May and the beginning of June in different places. A study in eastern Ontario found that although red-winged blackbirds began nesting earlier in years with warm springs, associated with low winter values in the North Atlantic Oscillation Index, egg laying dates remained unchanged. Male testosterone levels peak in the early part of the breeding season, but remain high throughout the season. Females reproduce for up to ten years.

Many aspects of territorialism (for example, the number of male songs and displays, and the number of intrusions into foreign territories) peak before mating. After this, the frequency of many of the territorial behaviors decreases and the males are mainly concerned with defending the females, eggs, and chicks against predation. Experiments in the systematic removal of birds from their territories suggest that the extra population of males that is present in swamps before copulations disappears after copulation.

Predation of eggs and nestlings is quite common. Nest predators include snakes, mink, raccoons, and other birds, even as small as marsh wrens. The red-winged blackbird is occasionally a victim of brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. Since nest predation is common, several adaptations have evolved in this species. Group nesting is one such trait which reduces the risk of individual predation by increasing the number of alert parents. Nesting over water reduces the likelihood of predation, as do alarm calls. Nests, in particular, offer a strategic advantage over predators in that they are often well concealed in thick, waterside reeds and positioned at a height of one to two meters. Males often act as sentinels, employing a variety of calls to denote the kind and severity of danger. Mobbing, especially by males, is also used to scare off unwanted predators, although mobbing often targets large animals and man-made devices by mistake. The brownish coloration of the female may also serve as an anti-predator trait in that it may provide camouflage for her and her nest while she is incubating.

===Predators and parasites===
Predators of red-winged blackbirds include such species as raccoons, American mink, long-tailed weasels, black-billed magpies, common grackles, owls, red-tailed hawks, short-tailed hawks, and snakes (such as the northern water snake and the plains garter snake). Ravens and grazers such as marsh wrens feed on eggs (and even small chicks), if the nest is left unattended, destroying the eggs, occasionally drinking from them, and pecking the nestlings to death.

The relative importance of different nest predators varies by geographic region: the top predators in different regions include the marsh wren in British Columbia, the magpies in Washington, and the raccoons in Ontario. The incidence of avian predation in red-winged blackbird nests is higher in western populations than in eastern populations.

Due to high predation rates, especially of eggs and chicks, the red-winged blackbird has developed various adaptations to protect its nests. One of them consists of nesting in groups, which reduces the danger since there is a greater number of alert parents. Nesting over water also lowers the chances of an attack. Nests in particular offer a strategic advantage as they are often hidden among dense riparian reeds, at a height of one or two meters. males often act as sentinels, using a repertoire of calls. Males in particular hunt down potential predators to scare them away, even when dealing with much larger animals. Aggressiveness of the red-winged blackbird towards the marsh wren, which also nests in swamps, causes a partial interspecies territorialism. On the other hand, nocturnal predators such as raccoons and American mink are not attacked by adults. Coloration of the female could serve to camouflage it, protecting it and its nest when it is incubated.

The red-winged blackbird can accommodate ectoparasites such as various &quot;Phthiraptera&quot;, the &quot;Ischnocera&quot; &quot;Philopterus agelaii&quot; and &quot;Brueelia ornatissima&quot;, and hematophagous mites, like &quot;Ornithonyssus sylviarum&quot;, and endoparasites like &quot;Haemoproteus quiscalus&quot;, &quot;Leucocytozoon icteris&quot;, &quot;Plasmodium vaughani&quot;, nematodes, flukes and tapeworms.

===Territorial===

The red-winged blackbird aggressively defends its territory from other animals, and will attack much larger birds. During breeding season, males will swoop at humans who encroach upon their nesting territory. Male red-winged blackbirds also exhibit important territorial behaviors, most of which provides them with the necessary fidelity for many years to come. A few important factors for male red-winged blackbirds’ adherence to territories include food, hiding spaces from predators, types of neighbors, and reactions towards predators. Additionally, a study was done on site fidelity and movement patterns by Les D. Beletsky and Gordon H. Orians in 1987 which explained much of the males’ territorial behaviors once migrated and settled onto a territory of their own. Sufficient evidence had shown that males are committed to staying in their territory over a long period of time and are not more likely to change territories at a younger age due to limited experience of knowledge for success. Studies also showed that most of the males that were first-time movers to a new territory were between two and three years old. The majority of males that moved were young and inexperienced. Later on they had moved towards more available territories. If males had chosen to leave their territory for reproductive success, as an example, they would do so within a short distance. Males who moved shorter distances were more successful in reproducing than those who moved longer distances. Further studies showed that when males moved further away from their territories there was a decrease in probability of successfully fledging.

The maximum longevity of the red-winged blackbird in the wild is 15.8 years.

===Migration===
Red-winged blackbirds that breed in the northern part of their range, i.e., Canada and border states in the United States, migrate south for the winter. However, populations near the Pacific and Gulf coasts of North America and those of Middle America are year-round resident. Red-winged blackbirds live in both Northern U.S. and Canada, ranging from Yucatan Peninsula in the south to the southern part of Alaska. These extensions account for the majority of the continent stretching from California&#x27;s Pacific coast and Canada to the eastern seaboard. Much of the populations within Middle America are non-migratory. During the fall, populations begin migrating towards Southern U.S. Movement of red-winged blackbirds can begin as early as August through October. Spring migration begins anywhere between mid-February to mid-May. Numerous birds from northern parts of the U.S., particularly the Great lakes, migrate nearly between their breeding season and winter Winter territorial areas differ based on geographic location. Other populations that migrate year-round include those located in Middle America or in the western U.S. and Gulf Coast. Females typically migrate longer distances than males. These female populations located near the Great Lakes migrate nearly farther. Yearly-traveled females also migrate further than adult males, while also moving roughly the same distance as other adult females. Red-winged blackbirds migrate primarily during daytime. In general, males’ migration flocks arrive prior to females in the spring and after females in the fall.

==Ecological and economic impact==
According to the American ornithologist Arthur Cleveland Bent, in the northern regions of its range the eastern red-winged blackbird is almost completely beneficial from an economic perspective and there are comparatively few complaints of severe crop damage. Their diet consists almost entirely of insects, very few of which are useful species, and herb seeds. However, it causes certain damages to the grains that germinate in spring and to sweet corn in summer, while the grains are still soft, tearing the foliaceous covering of the ears and ruining them from a commercial point of view. It also attacks other grains in a limited way, but most of what it consumes is waste left in the ground. In the Midwest, where these birds are much more abundant and where cereals are grown more extensively than in the North, red-winged blackbirds and other ichterids, in late summer and fall, do great damage to grain fields, both while they are maturing as when they are harvested . However, it has been claimed that even there are beneficial because the larvae removed from corncobs and beet plants can counteract pests of caterpillars. In the southern states, they seriously harm rice by plucking seedlings in spring and eating the still-soft grains as they mature, being in this sense almost as harmful as the Bobolink. On the other hand, they are of some use in consuming weed seeds that would otherwise devalue the product.

Being one of the most numerous birds on the continent, it plays an important role in the dispersal of other species. Since red-winged blackbirds gather and rest in such large numbers, the survival of certain species that join their flocks is likely to be affected by their company. They can also be an important source of food for animals such as raccoons and mink. Likewise, populations that nest and rest in swamps could cushion the effect of predation on duck species and other animals. In summary, these birds are so numerous and active that their mere presence and natural behavior is enough to influence the environment in a visible way.

===Positives: weed control and harmful insects===
Through the control of insect populations through predation and unwanted herbs with the consumption of their seeds, they allow the growth of larger plants and crops. They also eat on Anthonomus grandis and Hypera postica, two species of weevils affecting cotton and alfalfa respectively, as well as harmful caterpillars of the European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) and of the genus Malacosoma. In some areas of the southern United States, the seeds of the common plumber (Xanthium strumarium), a weed detrimental to soybeans and cotton, seems to be an important food source for the species.

During the breeding season, the approximately 8 million red-winged blackbirds nesting in Ohio and their chicks probably consume more than of insects, an average of almost . Many of these insects, such as the weevils (&quot;Hypera&quot; spp.), Come from alfalfa fields, pastures, oat fields and other crops. In cornfields, blackbirds often feed on corn worms (&quot;Helicoverpa zea&quot;) and beetles of the genus &quot;Diabrotica&quot;. In early spring, red-winged blackbirds consume corn borers (&quot;Ostrinia nubilalis&quot;) in fields with corn stubble. However, Bendell et al. (1981) found that the economic benefit of pest control, such as larvae of that lepidopteran, by the red-winged blackbird only compensated for 20% of the damage to crops caused by this bird.

===Negative aspects: consumption of cultivated grains===
The red-winged blackbirds can devastate farm fields. Despite the fact that they consume weed seeds, they are known to cause great damage to agriculture due to their habits of resting in massive groups and their taste for agricultural products. may be also causes harm to plantings corn, rice, sunflower and sorghum, particularly important near roosts. Red-winged blackbird is the largest species of Icterid in North America and the most damaging to crops. From 215 birds Neotropical migrants have been identified as causing, by a wide margin, the greatest economic loss. In North America, the damage to corn crops by this species has increased since the late 1960s to early 1980s, perhaps because of the increase in the area for grain production, and due to the reduction of small areas with stubble, hayfields and uncultivated land, which, in turn, accentuated the bird&#x27;s dependence on corn to ensure its livelihood.

Apparently, the male does more damage to this grain than the female. In some areas of Ohio, corn can account for up to 75% of the diet of males and only 6% of that of females in August and September. In South Dakota, in the late summer, the gizzards of the males studied contained 29% corn, while in the case of the female that number was limited to 9%.

===Situation in the Midwest===
The red-winged blackbird is the dominant species in the large concentrations of blackbirds that feed on the fields of sunflower, corn and small grains maturing in late summer or early fall in the Dakotas. In the 1970s, losses to sunflower and corn crops caused by blackbirds in the Dakotas exceeded $3 million annually for each case. In the northern part of the Great Plains, an area known as the Prairie Pothole Region, red-winged blackbirds are very abundant in summer. They congregate in post-reproductive flocks that significantly harm crops, particularly sunflower plantations near their home sites. Most sunflower damage occurs between mid-August and early September, when the calorie content of immature seeds is low and birds must consume more of them to satiate themselves. During this initial stage of predation on sunflower crops in which more than 75% of the total damage is caused, the red-winged blackbird represent 80% of the blackbirds observed in the fields of this seed. This period predates the massive migration of birds and most of them are of local origin. Most remain within of their native sites until the molting of their feathers is complete or nearly complete in late August or early September. Damage can be quite serious in the center and southeast of North Dakota and Northeast South Dakota, areas of high concentration of sunflower production and abundant wetlands that attract red-winged blackbird during the breeding season.

Investigations conducted between 1968 and 1979 revealed that blackbirds, notably the black-winged blackbird and the common grackle, annually destroyed less than 1% of corn crops in Ohio, amounting to a loss between 4 and 6 million dollars according to 1979 prices. 

All Ohio counties experience some degree of predation on their maize crops from blackbirds, but those most affected are a few counties where marshes that roost them still abound. The counties of Ottawa, Sandusky and Lucas, on the waters of Sandusky Bay and Lake Erie, were the hardest hit. These three counties, among the 19 studied between 1968 and 1976, contained 62% of the fields in which the losses exceeded 5% and 77% of those in which they exceeded 10%. Other counties with extensive localized damage were Erie, Ashtabula also located on the coasts of the mentioned water courses and Hamilton. Almost all the plantations with damages greater than 5% were within of some important roosting of blackbirds. In the 1968–1976 period, in northeast Sandusky County and northwest Ottawa, where large roosts of up to a million birds were discovered in late summer and fall, average losses exceeded 9% in fields from the roosts, but they were less than 5% at and less than 2% at . In southwestern Ontario, in the summer of 1964, it was found that the greatest damage to the cornfields by red-winged blackbird also occurred near roosts in swamps.

==Pest control==
The two main options that farmers can choose from to avoid the presence of birds once corn has entered the milky stage of its maturation process are the use of the chemical 4-aminopyridine and the implementation of mechanical devices to frighten birds away. The time chosen to take measures to disperse the blackbirds is of great importance since once the birds have chosen a field to feed there they are likely to return for several days. The longer they are allowed to feed unmolested, the more difficult it will become to scare them away. Also, most of the damage is inflicted in just a few days, when the pimples are soft; consequently, control techniques will not be very useful if applied after this period.

===Pest control history===
As early as 1667, Massachusetts Bay settlers had enacted laws to try to reduce blackbird populations and mitigate damage to corn. According to Henry David Thoreau, a law provided that each single man in a town must kill six of those birds and, as a punishment for not doing so, he could not marry until he had complied with the aforementioned design. Obviously, since blackbirds reproduce at a much higher speed than humans marry, this control strategy was a failure. Pioneers traveling west to the Great Lakes region faced similar problems. By 1749, blackbirds were so abundant around western Lake Erie that people took turns watching over the maturing grain crops.

At the beginning of the 20th century, in some places, when the reeds dried up, these circumstances were used to kill these birds in the following way. A crew approached a roost in silence, hidden in the darkness of the night, and simultaneously lit the reeds at various points, which were quickly enveloped by a single great flame. This caused a huge tumult among the red-winged blackbird, which, lit by fire, were shot down in large numbers as they hovered in midair and screamed all over the place. Sometimes straw was used for the same purpose, which was previously scattered near reeds and alder bushes (Alnus spp.) in which they gathered to rest, the burning of which caused great consternation among the birds. The gang returned the next day to collect the hunted prey.

Arthur Cleveland Bent says that, before it was banned the sale of prey hunting in the market, red-winged blackbirds were massacred in large numbers in autumn and sold in markets. When they had put on weight on a diet of grains or rice, their small bodies were served as delicious snacks on the gourmet tables . Few could distinguish them from bobolinks (&quot;Dolichonyx oryzivorus&quot;).

In 1926, when the US Biological Survey – predecessor of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service carried out its first compilation of roosts of undesirable ichterids, it was recorded in Ohio, with its large populations of these birds and the fifth largest area allocated to the cultivation of corn among the American states, a number of complaints higher than in any other state. During the 1950s, bird control committees were organized in some counties to deal with the damage to maize caused by blackbirds and the Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station now the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center and the Department of Zoology and Entomology of the state university began investigating the problem.

===Use of deadly traps and chemicals===
Crop predation has led to the use of traps, poison and surfactants by farmers in an attempt to control populations of red-winged blackbirds; these last properties suppress waterproof feathers, making them extremely vulnerable to the cold, but their effectiveness depends on certain atmospheric conditions, namely low temperatures and rainfall. Programs in which baits were used poisoned to reduce icteride concentrations in late summer have been unsuccessful. While thousands of birds have occasionally died, the effect on large roosting-associated flocks that sometimes contain more than a million individuals is small; In addition, specimens of other species frequently die. The use of large lure traps, which often catch hundreds of birds per day, is also ineffective against these large flocks.

===Use of 4-aminopyridine===
4-Aminopyridine is applied to one in one hundred particles of ground corn used as bait. Generally, corn is thrown into the fields from planes that release a load of about of bait per hectare on one third of the land. Because that amount of ground corn contains around 205,000 particles, approximately 2050 toxic particles are distributed per hectare treated. The ingestion of one or more of these particles by a blackbird causes erratic flight, calls for suffering and finally death; that behavior often leads the remaining birds in the flock to leave the field. The chemical DRC-1327, which has proven useful in mitigating damage to maturing corn, operates in the same way: when a bird ingests kernels from a partially hand-peeled cob to which the chemical has been applied with a sprayer manual, his erratic flight and his pre-death calls for suffering, which span a space of between five and fifteen minutes, chase away flocks from the fields.

The initial application of 4-aminopyridine should be carried out as soon as possible after the start of the milky stage of the grain ripening process. Two other booster applications five to seven days apart are generally recommended; Often just one is sufficient, but under conditions of prolonged bird activity more than three applications may be required at shorter intervals. In Brown County (Northeast South Dakota), in 1965, hand-spread 4-aminopyridine baits at intervals of about one week reduced projected red-winged blackbird loss by maturing corn crops by 85%. The distressing behavior exhibited by the individuals affected by the chemical produced a marked fear response in other members of the flocks and the fields were free of red-winged blackbirds even when the estimated directly affected proportion was less than 1%. It has even been suggested that the continued use of 4-aminopyridine over the years could cause a change in the pattern of migration to the south, as if birds were learning to avoid areas persistently treated with the chemical.

In another experiment in the same county, the number of blackbirds making use of the treated area fell dramatically over a period of five days after treatment had begun and remained low for the remainder of the season of damage to cornfields. The results of this method were largely limited to icterides. Although common pheasant were abundant, there was no evidence that any were affected, and mortality among other bird species was negligible.

The abundance of weeds should be considered as restricting the chances that birds will find bait particles scattered on the ground, so the use of this chemical must be accompanied by a weed control program. A less obvious problem is that of the insects that remove the bait. If Gryllus are detected in a field, ground corn is expected to disappear quickly. Crickets generally select untreated particles and leave the toxic ones behind; however, the rapid decrease in the total volume of ground corn on the ground decreases the attractiveness of ground-level feeding for blackbirds. Because cricket populations are difficult to control, more frequent applications or other bird control techniques may be desirable under these circumstances. A third problem is that of heavy rains, which cover the bait with soil or drag it into cracks in the ground. Likewise, a low population density of ichterides can reduce the effectiveness of its control with 4-aminopyridine.

===Non-lethal methods===
A variety of devices to repel them, including electronic noise-making systems, helium balloons tied in the fields, radio-controlled aircraft, and various types of scarecrows are occasionally used in cornfields. Methods such as scarecrows, pyrotechnics, and propane cannons, may help mitigate mild predation, but only work effectively if the duration of the damage period is less than that of the birds becoming accustomed to these methods. Red-winged blackbirds quickly become accustomed to them, particularly if the crop is a prime food source in an area with few alternative sources of livelihood. Although harvesting as early as possible after the corn has dried sufficiently can limit damage by northern grazing flocks, adjusting the harvest date does not help farmers reduce losses by red-winged blackbirds during the milky stage.

One approach that has been successful in controlling roosts in the highlands is dispersal of populations through habitat alteration or bird harassment. These procedures, carried out by biologists in cooperation with local citizens, have been successful in dispersing or displacing populations of up to one million individuals. Although this dispersion can sometimes move the problem from one place to another – especially when the area has been intensively cultivated with corn and alternative food sources are not abundant, it has often been effective in solving local problem situations. Because oats and wheat grains in already harvested fields constitute an important food for blackbirds in late summer, the postponement of plowing the land with small grain stubble can lessen the pressure exerted by the predation of these birds on the maturing corn. The natural existence or planting of plants such as millet, sorghum (&quot;Sorghum&quot; spp.), Polygons (&quot;Polygonum&quot; spp.) And various grasses for example, mohas (Setaria spp.) that could be beneficial. As a general ecological principle, diversity in the types of habitats that can be maintained in regions of intense agricultural activity is related to a greater probability that the damages caused by pests are restricted to economically tolerable levels.

Studies in sweet corn fields indicate that blackbirds could often be initially attracted to maturing crops by insects. Flocks can wander the land cultivated for about a week consuming insects and weed seeds before attacking the corn. &quot;Diabrotica&quot; beetles may be especially attractive during this period. Thus the birds become habituated to feeding in the fields and quickly move from insects to corn when it enters the vulnerable milky stage. Experiments in which insect populations in sweet corn crops were treated with insecticides during the week before the grain entered the milky phase, they showed that fewer birds visited these fields and less damage was recorded to the corn in the subsequent vulnerability period than in nearby untreated land. It is probable that the abundance of weeds in cornfields also increases their attractiveness to ichterids and their control would lead to a decrease in the losses produced by these birds.

===Chemical sterilization===
An alternative way to reduce populations of red-winged blackbird, and therefore the damage they cause to crops, involves implementing a program that is intended to interfere with their ability to reproduce, for example, through the use of sterilizing chemicals. Due to the polygynous nature of the species, it has been suggested that such a program could become more effective if directed at males. However, the incidence of promiscuity would imply that chemical sterilization of a certain fraction of males from a local population would not result in a proportional decrease in fertile clutches.

The effects of this method would probably vary according to the type of habitat in which the treated males have established their territories. In general, there should be a higher proportion of fertile clutches in those densely populated habitats and with a greater number of renidifications (nest reconstructions). Renidifications are more common in swamps than in the highlands. In turn, individuals that reproduce in the highlands probably feed more often within their own territories than those that reproduce in swamps, which probably makes promiscuity difficult in the first type of habitat. Thus, chemical sterilization could be more effective among upland populations than among swamp populations.

Sterilizing chemicals may reduce the number of chicks produced by a successful nest. Since renidification clutches are significantly fewer in number than the original, even if a female that first mated with a sterile male then renidified and mated with a fertile male, perhaps she would produce fewer chicks than she would have had if her first clutch would have been fertile.

The number of fertile clutches in a male&#x27;s territory may be limited through the sterilization of that male, but the degree to which that number decreases will depend on the disposition of the neighboring fertile territorial males and perhaps also on the number of fertile non-territorial males. in the population. Studies with artificial eggs suggest that incubation of sterile eggs would be prolonged, 98 since females normally incubate artificial eggs for around 20 days. An extended incubation of unviable eggs would result in fewer renidification attempts and, therefore, it decreased the opportunities to find a fertile mate for a female who originally mated with a sterile male.

==Relationship with humans==
Farmers have been known to use pesticides—such as parathion—in illegal attempts to control their populations. In the United States, such efforts are illegal because no pesticide can be used on non-target organisms, or for any use not explicitly listed on the pesticide&#x27;s label. However, the USDA has deliberately poisoned this species in the past: in 2009, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service reported poisoning over 950,000 red-winged blackbirds in Texas and Louisiana. This poisoning has been implicated as a potential cause of the decline of the rusty blackbird, a once abundant species that has declined 99% since the 1960s and has been recently listed as Threatened on the IUCN Red List.
In the Anishinaabe languages, an indigenous language group spoken throughout much of the bird&#x27;s northeastern range, this bird&#x27;s names are diverse. In the Oji-Cree language, the northernmost of the Anishinaabe languages, it is called &quot;jachakanoob&quot;, while the Ojibwa language spoken in Northwestern Ontario and into Manitoba ranging immediately south of the Oji-Cree&#x27;s range, the bird is called &quot;jachakanoo&quot; (with the cognates &quot;cahcahkaniw&quot; (Swampy Cree), &quot;cahcahkaluw&quot; (coastal Southern East Cree), &quot;cahcahkayuw&quot; (inland Southern East Cree), &quot;cahcahkayow&quot; (Plains Cree); the northern Algonquian languages classify the red-winged blackbird as a type of a junco or grackle, deriving the bird&#x27;s name from their word for &quot;spotted&quot; or &quot;marked&quot;. In the vast majority of the other Ojibwa language dialects, the bird is called &quot;memiskondinimaanganeshiinh&quot;, literally meaning &quot;a bird with a very red damn-little shoulder-blade&quot;. However, in the Odawa language, an Anishinaabe language in southwestern Ontario and in Michigan, the bird is instead called either &quot;memeskoniinisi&quot; (&quot;bird with a red [patch on its wing]&quot;) or &quot;memiskonigwiigaans&quot; (&quot;[bird with a] wing of small and very red [patch]&quot;). In N&#x27;syilxcn (Colville-Okanagan, Interior Salish language) the bird is known as ƛ̓kƛ̓aʕkək. In the Hoocąk language they are known as &quot;cooxją́ aporošucra&quot;, which describes the round red spot on its wing as well as identifying it as a blackbird.

In the Great Plains, the Lakota language, another Indigenous language spoken throughout much of the bird&#x27;s range, the bird is called &quot;wabloša&quot; (&quot;wings of red&quot;). Its songs are described in Lakota as &quot;tōke, mat&#x27;ā nī&quot; (&quot;oh! that I might die&quot;), as &quot;nakun miyē&quot; (&quot;...and me&quot;), as &quot;miš eyā&quot; (&quot;me too!&quot;), and as &quot;cap&#x27;cehlī&quot; (&quot;a beaver&#x27;s running sore&quot;).

==Conservation status==
It is a species of least-concern. Being one of the largest and most widely distributed birds in North America, little has been done to protect it from the effects of habitat destruction and urbanization. It can survive in a wide range of environments, many populations manage to overcome the loss of natural habitats. However, red-winged blackbirds thrive in wetland areas and with the destruction of natural wetlands their population is likely to shrink. The species is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act 1918, a formal treaty between the United States and Canada that was later expanded to include Mexico. This law gives them legal protection in the United States, but they can be killed &quot;when they are found preying or about to prey on ornamental trees or trees planted for shade, crops, livestock or wildlife.&quot;

A study in Illinois indicated that red-winged blackbird populations doubled between 1908 and 1958. It had traditionally reproduced in wetlands, with Ohio primarily inhabiting swamps associated with lakes and rivers. During the 20th century, however, it adapted to man-made habitat changes and now often nests in hayfields, along roads and ditches, and elsewhere in the highlands.

Despite its successful adaptation to changes in practices related to land use, populations of red-winged blackbird have reduced the width of its range during the second half of the twentieth century, and Changes in the abundance and adequacy of grasslands have been implicated in this. In Ohio, the red-winged blackbird was negatively affected between 1966 and 1996 by the decrease in hay production, the earlier harvest of hay and the increase in crops planted in furrows, a situation homologous to that suffered by other species of birds from less numerous grasslands. Although the negative effect of the increased efficiency and the diminishing diversity of modern agricultural practices on the populations of red-winged blackbird in this state may be perceived as a positive event by the producers of corn and sunflower, the agricultural practices that have precipitated the numerical decline of this species may have caused more severe repercussions for birds from less common grasslands, such as the upland sandpiper and the Grasshopper sparrow.

In the late 1970s, Ohio hosted the highest density of blackbirds during the breeding season among all US states and Canadian provinces, However, between 1966 and 1996, the reproductive populations in this state showed a marked decrease. Decreasing the area under hay other than alfalfa between those same years was likely to reduce the availability of quality nesting habitats. Likewise, corn even though it attracts insects that red-winged blackbirds consume and despite the fact that their grains represent in themselves an energy source and soybeans which do not constitute a food source for the species, which together made up 1966 to 1996, an average of 70% of the cultivated area in Ohio, do not provide adequate nesting habitat. In turn, the large annual fluctuations in the area cultivated with hay, both from one year to the next and within the same year of a certain reproductive season, Similarly, in Ontario between 1974 and 1995, the average size of harems in a given year was positively related to hay production from the previous year, although the percentage variation in the size of harems from one season to the next the following was not linearly related to the annual percentage change in hay production; Hay production declined during this period and the size of the harems decreased from approximately three females per male to 1.6 females.

In addition in Ontario, a negative relationship was found between the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) in the six months prior to a certain reproductive season and the size of the harems. If winter mortality contributes to the decrease in the size of the harems, the annual variations in their size should be related to the annual changes in the rates of return of marked territorial males. Variations in the size of harems and male return rates per year were indeed found to be positively correlated. Although not as pronounced, the relationship between male return rates and winter NAO values was similar to that between changes in harem size and NAO.

On the other hand, in southwestern Quebec, red-winged blackbird populations doubled between 1966 and 1981, apparently in response to the development of maize production. The increased availability of residual grains in spring and summer. the reproductive season will probably play a fundamental role in the growth of this bird&#x27;s population. Likewise, in the mid-1990s, the reproductive population of North Dakota which at least between 1994 and 2002 was at the forefront among all the American states and Canadian provinces in terms of population density of this species began to increase rapidly.

<text>Wat Phra Kaew (, , ), commonly known in English as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and officially as Wat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram, is regarded as the most sacred Buddhist temple in Thailand. The complex consists of a number of buildings within the precincts of the Grand Palace in the historical centre of Bangkok. It houses the statue of the Emerald Buddha, which is venerated as the country&#x27;s palladium.

Construction of the temple began in 1783 under the orders of Rama I, the first king of the Chakri dynasty. Since then, each successive king has been personally involved in adding, restoring and embellishing the temple during their reigns as a way of making religious merit and glorifying the dynasty. Many important state and royal ceremonies are held within the temple each year, presided by the king in person and attended by government officials. This makes the temple the nation&#x27;s preeminent place of worship and a national shrine for the monarchy and the state. Throughout the years, each king has donated sacred and valuable objects to the temple, making it a treasury as well.

The temple complex comprises various buildings for specific religious purposes built in a variety of Thai architectural styles, while still adhering to the traditional principles of Thai religious architecture.

==History==

When King Rama I made Bangkok the capital city of the Rattanakosin Kingdom on 6 April 1782, a suitable royal palace and temple was needed to legitimize the new Chakri dynasty. The King&#x27;s reason for moving the capital city was a desire to distance himself from the previous regime of King Taksin, whom he had replaced as king of Siam. The old royal palace in Thonburi was small and sandwiched between two temples; Wat Arun and Wat Tai Talat, prohibiting further expansion.

Rama I established the Grand Palace on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya River, within the fortified city area now known as Rattanakosin Island. Traditionally, an area was always set aside within the palace compound for the construction of a royal temple or chapel for the king and the royal family&#x27;s personal use. The temple (or wat) would have all the features of any regular Buddhist temple except for living quarters for monks. Surrounded on all sides by a wall, the temple would be a distinct space for worship separate from the king&#x27;s residential space. As the temple would be built within the palace of the king, no monks would be lodged there. Instead, monks from various other temples would be invited to perform rituals and then leave. This was the case with Wat Mahathat, a royal chapel within the grounds of the royal palace at Sukhothai, Wat Phra Si Sanphet at Ayutthaya and Wat Arun in Thonburi. Wat Phra Si Sanphet, built next to the royal palace of the king of Ayutthaya, particularly influenced the building of this new temple.
Construction on the temple began in 1783. The temple was given the formal name Wat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram, meaning &quot;the temple containing the beautiful jewel of the monastery of the divine teacher&quot;. The temple&#x27;s main hall was the first building within the entire palace compound that was completed in masonry, while the king&#x27;s residence was still made of wood. The temple complex was built in the northeastern corner of the Outer Court of the Grand Palace. In February/March 1785, the Emerald Buddha was transported with great ceremony from its former home at Wat Arun in Thonburi across the river to the Rattanakosin side and installed at its present position. In 1786 Rama I gave Bangkok an official name as the new capital of Siam. Translated, the name mentions the temple and the Emerald Buddha itself: &quot;The City of Angels, Great City, the Residence of the Emerald Buddha, the Great City of God Indra, Ayutthaya, the World Endowed with Nine Precious Gems, the Happy City Abounding in Great Royal Palaces which Resemble the Heavenly Abode Wherein Dwell the Reincarnated Gods, a City Given by Indra and Built by Vishvakarman&quot;.

The temple has undergone many different periods of major renovations, beginning with the reigns of Rama III and Rama IV. Rama III started the rebuilding in 1831 for the 50th anniversary of Bangkok in 1832, while Rama IV&#x27;s restoration was completed by Rama V in time for the Bangkok centennial celebrations in 1882. Further restoration took place under the reigns of Rama VII during Bangkok&#x27;s 150th Anniversary in 1932 and of Rama IX for the 200th Anniversary in 1982.

As the royal temple, Wat Phra Kaew continues to serve as the site of Buddhist religious rites undertaken by the king and the royal family, including major events such as coronations, royal ordinations and investiture of the supreme patriarch. The king or an appointee also attends annual ceremonies marking the major Buddhist holidays Visakha Puja, Asalha Puja and Magha Puja at the temple. Three times a year, the gold garments of the Emerald Buddha image are changed in a royal ceremony marking the change of the seasons. Annual rites are also held on Chakri Memorial Day, the Royal Ploughing Ceremony, the King&#x27;s Birthday and Songkran (the traditional Thai new year). On most other days, the temple, together with certain areas of the Grand Palace, is open to visitors, and they are among the country&#x27;s best known tourist attractions.

==Ubosot==

The Phra Ubosot (), or ordination hall, occupies almost the entire southern part of the temple complex. The Ubosot is surrounded by a low wall; this separation emphasises the building&#x27;s sacred nature. The wall contains eight small pavilions with tall spires, each housing a double &quot;bai sema&quot; stone covered in gold leaf. In Thai religious architecture, such stones traditionally denote a sacred boundary within which the ordination of monks could be carried out.

Construction of the Ubosot began during the reign of Rama I in 1783; as such, the building is one of the oldest structures within the temple. The Ubosot was built to house the Buddha image known as the Emerald Buddha, which the King had captured from Vientiane, Laos, in 1779. Previously, the image was housed in the Emerald Buddha hall in the Wat Arun complex on the Thonburi side of the Chao Phraya River. The Emerald Buddha was ceremonially installed at its present position in the temple in February/March 1785. In 1831, Rama III ordered a major renovation of the exterior of the Ubosot.

===Exterior===

The Ubosot is rectangular and single-storeyed, with the main entrance on the eastern end. The hall is surrounded by columns supporting a massive roof. On the eastern and western ends of the hall, an extended porch projects outwards with additional columns. The roof is covered with blue, yellow and orange glazed tiles. The pediments at either end of the roof depict the Hindu god Narayana (or Vishnu) mounted on the back of a Garuda (a mythical half-man, half-bird), with the latter holding in both hands the tails of two Naga serpents. The figure of the god is a traditional symbol of kingship and has been adopted by Thai kings as their symbol since ancient times. The &quot;vahana&quot; (or vehicle) of the god is the mythical Garuda. A creature of great strength and loyalty, the Garuda has been adopted as the national emblem of Thailand. Hung along the eaves of the roof are hundreds of small, gilded wind-bells with Bodhi-leaf sails. The brackets protruding from the top of the columns to support the roof take the form of Nagas with their heads pointing downwards. This commemorates the legend of Mucalinda, the King of the Nagas, who protected the Buddha from rain before he achieved Enlightenment. The Ubosot is surrounded by forty-eight square columns, each with twelve indented corners. Each column is decorated with glass mosaic and gilded gold edges; the capitals depict lotus petals covered in coloured glass mosaic.
The exterior walls of the Ubosot are covered in traditional Thai decorations made of gold leaf and coloured glass. Built on a high base of several layers, the hall is raised high above the ground and must be entered through a stairway. The lowest of the base layers is decorated with painted tiles of floral designs with a pale blue background. The next level is a lotus design base in coloured glass. The next level above is decorated with the Garuda. One hundred and twelve Garudas, each grasping within its claws two Naga serpents, surround all four sides of the Ubosot. They are gilded in gold leaf and inlaid with glass mosaic. There are six doors, three on each end of the building, each door topped with crown-like, spire-shaped ornamentation and accessible only through a short staircase. The central door, slightly larger than the others, is used only by the king. The doors are decorated with mother-of-pearl inlay depicting mythical beasts and foliage designs. The walls of the Ubosot are extremely thick, and inside the inner door frame guardian deities are depicted in gold carrying either spears or swords.

On the outside, flanking the steps leading to the doors of the Ubosot, stand twelve bronze lions. Some of these are copies which were probably cast by Rama III. They were based on a pair of original lions taken from Cambodia by Rama I.

===Interior===

The entire interior of the Ubosot is covered in painted murals depicting stories about the Buddha. The wooden ceiling is painted red with star designs made in glass mosaic. On the western end of the Ubosot is the multi-tiered pedestal on which the Emerald Buddha sits, and numerous other Buddha images surrounding it. On the eastern wall, the story of the Buddha and the demon Mara is depicted. This recounts the story of the Buddha when, prior to achieving enlightenment, Mara and his army tried to stop him. Instead, the Buddha, sitting in the Maravijaya attitude, asked the earth goddess Phra Mae Thorani to defend him. She is depicted right above the central door, wringing out water from her hair, creating a great flood that drowned Mara and his army. On the western wall behind the Emerald Buddha, the &quot;Traiphum&quot; or Buddhist cosmology is depicted. On the northern and southern walls the murals are divided into horizontal sections. Stories concerning the life of the Buddha are depicted on the top sections above the windows. Between each of the windows, the Jataka tales—tales of the previous lives of the Buddha—are depicted. Below the windows, the northern wall depicts a royal procession by land, with the king seated on a war elephant and marching troops on either side. The lower southern wall shows a royal procession by water, with royal barges and other war boats accompanying the king along a river.

===The Emerald Buddha===
The Emerald Buddha, or Phra Kaeo Morakot (), formally named Phra Phuttha Maha Mani Rattana Patimakon (), is the temple&#x27;s main Buddha image as well as its namesake. The sacred image is of the meditating Gautama Buddha seated in the lotus position, made of a semi-precious green stone (usually described as jade), clothed in gold, and about tall.

The multi-tiered pedestal (: ) of the Emerald Buddha is in the shape of a &quot;butsabok&quot; throne, an open pavilion on a pyramidal base, topped with a tall spire. The highly ornamented pedestal was made in the reign of Rama I of carved wood and then gilded in gold leaf. Later, the pedestal was heightened by Rama III when he added the funeral bier of Rama II underneath the pedestal as a base. Numerous Buddha images are enshrined around the pedestal, as well as an accumulation of treasures donated by the various kings in the past 200 years. Examples include a pair of marble vases and a marble sermon throne from Europe, donated to the temple in 1908.

===Other Buddha images===
Surrounding the pedestal are other Buddha images made and donated to the temple by various kings. The most notable of these are:
====Phra Phuttha Yotfa Chulalok====
The image stands to the front and right side of the Emerald Buddha, looking from the entrance (to the pedestal&#x27;s north). The standing Buddha has both of his palms turned outwards in the hand gesture called Abhayamudra, or the gesture of fearlessness. This iconographic attitude is called the &quot;calming of the waters&quot;. This attitude commemorates one of the Buddha&#x27;s miracles when he stopped a flood from reaching his dwelling. This attitude is symbolic of the Buddha&#x27;s mastery over the passions. The image is richly attired, wearing a crown, necklace, rings, armlets and other regalia. This presentation of the Buddha is typical of the images cast by kings and royalty during the Ayutthaya and early Bangkok periods. The image is over tall and was cast in bronze and gilded in gold on the orders of Rama III in 1841 to commemorate the reign of his grandfather Rama I.

====Phra Phuttha Loetla Naphalai====
The second image stands to the front and left of the Emerald Buddha (to the pedestal&#x27;s south). It is identical to the other Buddha image. However, this Buddha image commemorates the reign of Rama II. The names of these two Buddha images; Phra Phuttha Yotfa Chulalok () and Phra Phuttha Loetla Naphalai (), officially given to them by royal proclamation issued by Rama III, are also the official reign names by which these two deceased kings would henceforth be known. Later, Rama IV would place relics of the Buddha within the crowns of each image.

====Buddhas representing members of the Chakri dynasty====
Surrounding the central pedestal of the Emerald Buddha are ten other Buddha images that commemorate the life of a member of the early Chakri dynasty. All of these were cast by successive kings for a deceased ancestor or relative. These images are also in the &quot;calming of the waters&quot; attitude. They are distinguished by the robes; those that have their robes splayed outwards represent male royalty, while those with robes that hug tightly around the body represent female royalty. The images are set on three levels, with one at each of the four corners of the pedestal on the top level, four similarly at the corners of the middle level, and only two towards the front of the pedestal on the bottom level.

====Phra Samphuttha Phanni====
Situated on the base in the front of the pedestal is the Phra Samphuttha Phanni (). This Buddha image was made by Rama IV in 1830 while he was still a monk. Once he became king in 1851, he swapped the image with the Phra Phuttha Sihing, which was moved to the Front Palace and given to his brother Pinklao. This golden Buddha image is depicted in the meditation attitude and is tall. The form and artistry of the image was a clear break from the previous traditional iconography of the Buddha. The naturalistic face and realistic robes was a style favoured by Rama IV.

===Buddha image halls===

Three structures sit along the west walls of the Ubosot, all commissioned by Rama IV. Ratchakoramanuson Buddha image hall () is the northernmost, followed by Phra Photithat Phiman () and Ratchaphongsanuson Buddha image hall (). The Ratchakoramanuson and Ratchaphongsanuson are identical. They hold a total of forty-two Buddha images. The Ratchaphongsanuson hall holds thirty-four Buddha images representing the former kings of the Ayutthaya and Thonburi kingdoms—the murals inside accordingly depict the history of the foundation of Ayutthaya—while the Ratchakoramanuson hall holds eight Buddha images of the Rattanakosin Kingdom, with murals depicting the foundation of Bangkok. All of the Buddha images were cast in copper for Rama III. His successor Rama IV had them gilded in gold. In between these halls is the Phra Photithat Phiman, a &quot;butsabok&quot; throne with a crown-shaped spire. Inside is a smaller stupa of gold containing a relic of the Buddha obtained by Rama IV from the north of Thailand.

===Sala===
Surrounding the Ubosot, all along its four sides are twelve open &quot;sala rai&quot; (), or pavilions, with grey marble bases. These sala were built during the reign of Rama I for the faithful to listen to chants or sermons emanating from within the Ubosot. All twelve pavilions are of the same design and size, with six square columns supporting a roof of blue and orange glazed tiles. The pavilions have been reconstructed and restored several times by different kings throughout the years.

===Chao Mae Kuan Im===

Opposite the front of the Ubosot is a stone image of Chao Mae Kuan Im (or Guanyin), a Bodhisattva known as Avalokiteśvara in the Mahayana branch of Buddhism. She sits in front of a sandstone column topped by a bronze lotus flower, and is flanked by two stone mythical birds called &quot;Nok Wayupak&quot;. Around this group there are two lead oxen facing the gate. These were formerly part of the king&#x27;s pavilion where he would watch the Royal Ploughing Ceremony, an important agricultural rite performed annually in front of the reigning king. The ox statues were moved into the temple by Rama V. Around this area, incense sticks can be lit and flower offerings made by the public, as these activities are prohibited within the Ubosot itself.

===The Hermit===
Behind the Ubosot sits the image of the hermit (or rishi) Jivaka Komarabhacca (). The image was cast in bronze during the reign of Rama III for the temple. In front of the hermit is a large grinding stone. In the past, traditional medical practitioners would make their potions on this stone, imbuing it with the sanctity of the hermit image.

==Phaithi terrace==

The Than Phaithi () is a raised terrace or base that elevates several important structures inside the temple, the three principal ones being Prasat Phra Thep Bidon, the Phra Mondop and the Phra Si Rattana Chedi. The terrace has six sets of steps leading up to it: two on the north, one on the east, two on the south and one on the west. Originally, the terrace contained only the Phra Mondop; in 1855, Rama IV ordered the expansion of the base, upon which the two other structures were later built. The arrangement of these structures in a straight line echoes the classical arrangement of temples in both Sukhothai and Ayutthaya.

===Prasat Phra Thep Bidon===

The Prasat Phra Thep Bidon () is on the eastern end of the Than Phaithi. Originally built to house the Emerald Buddha by Rama IV, construction on the first structure—then called the Phutthaprang Prasat ()—began in 1855, based on the Prasat Thong in the royal palace of Ayutthaya. The King died before its completion in 1882, and his plans to move the Emerald Buddha into it never materialised. In 1903, a fire ravaged the building, necessitating a complete rebuild. The present structure was completed during the reign of Rama VI in the early 20th century. The King decided to change the purpose of the building, and turned it into a memorial to his predecessors. The name was changed to Prasat Phra Thep Bidon, known in English as the Royal Pantheon. Rama VI had full-size, lifelike statues of the first five Chakri kings made and installed in the pantheon. Further statues were added in 1927, 1959 and 2020. Currently, the pantheon contains nine statues. Normally closed to the public, the pantheon is opened annually on 6 April for Chakri Memorial Day, a national holiday in Thailand. The pantheon is laid out in a cruciform plan. It has four entrances, one at the end of each arm, the main entrance being on the east side. The building is in the form known as &quot;prasat&quot;, with a tall spire in the middle of the roof, a feature usually reserved for royal residences. The roof is covered in green and orange tiles. The four pediments of the pantheon depict the personal insignia of the first four Chakri kings. This is a break with the traditional depiction of Narayana, which was previously seen on royal temples. The north pediment depicts the personal insignia of Rama I (a Thai numeral one), the southern of Rama II (a Garuda), the west of Rama III (a triple-doored vimana) and the east of Rama IV (a royal crown). The exterior walls of the pantheon are decorated with blue tiles with floral motifs. A royal crown tops each of the doors and windows of the pantheon. The east steps of the Than Phaithi leading up towards the pantheon were redesigned with marble steps; on either side the railings are in the form of two five-headed crowned Phaya Nagas.

===Phra Mondop===

The Phra Mondop () is situated in the middle of the Than Phaithi. The Phra Mondop is a repository of sacred texts, sometimes referred to as a library (&quot;ho trai&quot;). The present structure was built by Rama I to replace an earlier structure that burnt down. This previous structure was built in the middle of a pool on raised columns to protect the texts from termites; such buildings were a common feature in Thai temples. The new Phra Mondop discarded this feature, instead putting the library on top of a raised base. In 1788 Rama I ordered a complete revision and compilation of the Tripitaka, as the previous royal copies were destroyed in the sack of Ayutthaya in 1767. This revision was made by the monks of Wat Mahathat Yuwaratrangsarit. Once the revision was complete, a set of the texts was deposited inside the Phra Mondop. During the reign of Rama III, the exterior of the Phra Mondop was restored in time for the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Bangkok in 1832. The Phra Mondop is roughly square in outline and has a &quot;mondop&quot; style roof: a square-based tapering spire. When Rama IV decided to build the two structures on either side of the Phra Mondop, he decided to lower the height of the spire significantly. The Phra Mondop is richly decorated on the exterior walls—twenty square columns with indented corners surround the central hall. The columns are decorated with white, green and red glass. The exterior walls are adorned with the &quot;thepphanom&quot; motif, or devas in prayer, covered with gold leaf and surrounded with green glass. Numerous small, gilded wind-bells with Bodhi leaf sails are hung from the eaves on all sides. Crowns adorn the top of the four doors on the sides of the Phra Mondop. On the four corners of the library are four stone Buddhas obtained by Rama V from Java, Indonesia. These Borobudur-style Buddhas are replicas, with the originals now in the Museum of the Emerald Buddha Temple. The Phra Mondop only has one room; the floor is covered in a mat made of woven silver. In the middle of the room is a highly intricate mother-of-pearl inlay manuscript cabinet containing all 84,000 chapters of the Tripitaka. Four smaller cabinets are placed at the four corners of the room.

===Phra Si Rattana Chedi===

The Phra Si Rattana Chedi () is on the western end of the Than Phaithi and houses relics of the Buddha from Sri Lanka, which were given to Rama IV. Constructed in 1855, the circular bell-shaped stupa (or &quot;chedi&quot;) is built of brick masonry. The stupa was later entirely covered in gold-coloured tiles specially imported from Italy by Rama V. The bell-shaped stupa is made up of several tiers, with large round bases leading up to a bell-shaped middle, interrupted by a square section that is then topped with twenty concentric circular discs of decreasing size topped by a tall spire. The design was based on the stupas of Wat Phra Si Sanphet in Ayutthaya, which in turn took inspiration from the stupas of Sri Lanka. The stupa has four entrances with protruding porticoes. Each portico is crowned with an exact miniature of the stupa and is decorated on three sides with a pediment. The interior of the stupa is a round hall, from the ceiling of which a &quot;chatra&quot; (multi-tiered royal umbrella) is suspended. In the middle of the hall is a smaller stupa of black lacquer; this is the reliquary in which the relics of the Buddha are kept.

===Phra Suwannachedi===

Two golden stupas, titled Phra Suwannachedi (), are situated to the east of the terrace, flanking the steps leading up to the Prasat Phra Thep Bidon. The two &quot;chedi&quot; were built by Rama I to commemorate his parents, the southern &quot;chedi&quot; for his father Thongdi and the northern for this mother Daoreung. The two &quot;chedi&quot; are almost identical. They each have a marble octagonal base wide and topped with a golden, square-based stupa with triple indented corners in height. The top spire is decorated in nine levels of layered lotus bud motifs. The structures are covered in copper sheets painted over with lacquer and gilded in gold leaf. The two &quot;chedi&quot; were moved when the terrace was expanded to accommodate the royal pantheon. Around the base of the &quot;chedi&quot;, Rama V had figures of monkeys and &quot;yaksha&quot; (&quot;giants&quot;) supporting the &quot;chedi&quot;. Each has four monkeys and sixteen giants around the sides. The colour and clothing of these figures identify them with a particular character in the &quot;Ramakien&quot; epic.

===Monuments of the royal insignia===
The Monuments of the royal insignia or Phra Borom Ratcha Sanyalak () are four monuments depicting the nine insignia of the kings of the Chakri dynasty. In 1882, on the centenary of the founding of Bangkok, Rama V ordered the construction of three monuments in the form of a &quot;butsabok&quot; throne to house depictions of the insignia of previous kings. These insignia were based on the kings&#x27; personal seals. Later, a fourth was added to accommodate later kings. They surround the Phra Mondop at each corner. Each of the golden &quot;butsabok&quot; thrones are built on raised marble bases, each side with inscriptions describing each king&#x27;s contribution to the building or repair of the temple itself. On each of the corners are two miniature golden multi-tiered umbrellas: the four on the upper level have seven tiers and those on the bottom level have five tiers. Surrounding the monuments are miniature bronze elephants; these represent the white elephants important in each king&#x27;s reign. The first monument on the northwest corner depicts the insignia of the first three kings; Rama I (the crown without ear ornaments), Rama II (the Garuda) and Rama III (a triple-doored vimana). The southeast monument houses the insignia of Rama IV (a royal crown), and the southwest monument is the insignia of Rama V (the Phra Kiao or coronet). The fourth monument on the northeast corner depicts the insignia of four kings: Rama VI (a thunderbolt or &quot;vajra&quot;), Rama VII (three arrows), Rama VIII (a Bodhisattva) and Rama IX (the Octagonal Throne and &quot;chakra&quot;).

===Phra Chedi Songkhrueang===
The four decorated &quot;chedi&quot; called the Phra Chedi Songkhrueang () are situated behind the Phra Si Rattana Chedi, two on either side of the western porch. The &quot;chedi&quot; have a square plan with indented corners. The bases are white, and the top part is decorated in gold leaf and coloured glass. Like the two golden &quot;chedi&quot;, these were moved to their present position to make way for the expansion of the terrace.

===Model of Angkor Wat===

The model of Angkor Wat was borne out of an idea of Rama IV of moving one of the Khmer temples to Bangkok. However this proved unfeasible, so he ordered that a detailed scale model of Angkor Wat be made instead. The ancient Khmer temple complex had recently been rediscovered in Cambodia—then under Siamese suzerainty—in 1860. This highly detailed model was installed to the north of the Phra Mondop.

===Mythological figures===
Seven pairs of mythological figures decorate the terrace, made of bronze and gilded with gold leaf. These are half-animal half-human celestial beings which, according to tradition, inhabited the mythical Himavanta forest. They are the &quot;Theppaksi&quot;, human male upper body with feathered arms, bird lower body, human feet and holding a sword; &quot;Thepnorasi&quot;, human male upper body, lion lower body and holding a flower; &quot;Singhaphanon&quot;, monkey upper body, lion lower body and holding a sceptre; &quot;Apsarasingha&quot; (&quot;Apsonsi&quot;), human female upper body and lion lower body; &quot;Asurapaksi&quot;, giant upper body and bird lower body; &quot;Kinnon&quot; (&quot;kinnara&quot;), human male upper body and bird lower body; and the &quot;Asurawayuphak&quot;, giant upper body, bird lower body and holding a mace.

===Southern porch===

The southern porch was the former entrance gate to the Phra Mondop; it was probably moved to its present position when the terrace was expanded. The pediment displays the insignia of Rama III, a triple-doored vimana. The doors are made of carved wood depicting two warriors holding a spear and gilded in gold leaf.

===Western porch===
The western porch was constructed by Rama IV as an entrance to the expanded terrace. The porch was decorated in coloured ceramics in floral and geometrical designs. In the form of a &quot;prasat&quot;, the porch&#x27;s roof has a central spire rising from in the middle.

===Panom Mak===
Panom Mak () are eighteen decorative sculptures representing flowers and banana leaves offerings on a tray. They are based on traditional flower arrangements offered to Buddha statues by devotees as an act of making merit. These sculptures are distributed along the eastern and western edges of the terrace. Made of plaster and covered in ceramic tiles of various colours, they were added to the terrace by Rama V.

===Phra Sawet Kudakhan Wihan Yot===

The Phra Sawet Kudakhan Wihan Yot () or the Wihan Yot extends northwards from the terrace. The building, a vihara, serves as a Buddha image hall, and was first built by Rama III to house many important Buddha images. The building has a cruciform plan and is topped in the middle of the roof with a tall spire in the form of a crown. The spire is decorated with coloured porcelain in floral designs. The top of the window arches display the royal cypher of Rama V under a crown; this indicates that vihara was restored by the King. Bronze figures of &quot;Tantima&quot; birds—birds with a human torso and Garuda head—guard the entrances on the west and east sides. The doors of the vihara feature mother-of-pearl inlay and were taken from Wat Pa Mok in Ang Thong Province.

==Ho Phra Khanthararat==

The Ho Phra Khanthararat () shares its base with the Phra Mondop Yot Prang (). Built on the orders of Rama IV, both are situated on the southeastern side of the Ubosot. A Buddha shrine, the small structure was built to house the Phra Khanthararat image. The Buddha image is associated with the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. The image was originally cast in bronze by Rama I. Later, Rama IV had it gilded in gold and a large diamond embedded in its forehead. The Ho Phra Khanthararat is decorated on the exterior with green, blue and yellow tiles. The entrance is from the north with a door portico extending out from the front of the hall. Behind the portico, the rectangular hall is topped with a &quot;prang&quot; spire, and the four pediments below it are decorated with floral designs. The carved doors and windows of the shrine depict sheaves of rice, fish and shrimp to represent the fecundity of the nation.

==Phra Mondop Yot Prang==
The Phra Mondop Yot Prang sits on a taller platform behind the Ho Phra Khanthararat. The octagonal base is topped with a &quot;mondop&quot; pavilion and spire. Inside the pavilion is a small golden stupa. The stupa was obtained by Rama IV when he was still a monk and contained important Buddhist relics. Miniature stone sculptures of Chinese guardian lions surround the walls of both shrines.

==Bell Tower==

The Bell Tower, or Ho Rakhang (), is located to the south of the complex. The first tower was built by Rama I to house a single bell. Rama IV ordered it to be completely rebuilt. This reconstruction was completed just in time for the centenary of Bangkok in 1882. The tower has an octagonal base, with four doors and protruding porticoes on each side. Inside there are steps leading up to the bell. The bell is hung underneath a &quot;mondop&quot;-style spire. The entire structure is covered in coloured porcelain in floral and geometrical designs. The bell is only rung at the investiture of the supreme patriarch.

==Ho Phra Nak==

The Ho Phra Nak () is a royal mausoleum on the northwestern side of the temple. It was previously a Buddha image hall and was built by Rama I to house the sacred &quot;Phra Nak&quot; Buddha image from Ayutthaya, which was made of gold and copper. Even though the image was eventually moved to the Wihan Yot, the name remained. The hall is rectangular, with an entrance hall on the east side. The roof is covered in green and orange tiles. Inside, the hall is divided into seven rooms. Ashes and remains of members of the royal family are kept here. Formerly, only the ashes of female royalty was kept here, as was the tradition at Ayutthaya. Later, however, the ashes of many senior male members were also kept here as well. Notably, it contains the ashes of all the viceroys of the Chakri dynasty and their princely descendants. These ashes are kept in hundreds of individual gold urns.

==Ho Phra Monthiantham==

The Ho Phra Monthiantham () is a scripture hall on the north-eastern side of the temple. Its construction was paid for by the viceroy Maha Sura Singhanat, brother of Rama I. The hall is rectangular, surrounded on all sides with columns supporting a four-level roof. The entrance door is on the west side. The roof is covered in yellow and orange tiles. The pediment of the hall depicts the god Indra astride Airavata, the three-headed elephant. The inside of the hall is decorated with wood carvings of Hanuman, the symbol of the viceroy. The hall contains two mother-of-pearl inlay bookcases containing the Tripitaka. Today, the hall is also used for Buddhist sermons on Buddhist holy days. Formerly, the hall was used as a classroom for novice monks learning religious texts and as an exam room for monks.

==Row of prang==

The row of eight &quot;prang&quot;, formally known as Phra Atsda Maha Chedi (), was built by Rama I and later covered in delicate coloured porcelain by Rama III. These &quot;prang&quot; are typical of the Rattanakosin period, being taller and thinner than those of Ayutthaya. Each spire has an octagonal base with brick foundations, with the decorations made of plaster. Each has four doorways with figures of golden standing devas on each side, above them are a band of supporting &quot;yaksha&quot; or giants. The &quot;prang&quot; stood mostly outside the complex, along the eastern length of the temple wall. In the reign of King Rama IV, the temple wall was enlarged and two of the &quot;prang&quot; were enclosed inside the temple.

Each of the &quot;prang&quot; represents a different aspect of Buddhism. The &quot;prang&quot; are arranged from north to south and are differentiated by their colours: the Phra Sammasamphuttha Mahachedi in white is dedicated to the Gautama Buddha. The Phra Satthampariyat Wara Mahachedi in blue is dedicated to the Dharma (Buddhist scriptures). The Phra Ariyasong Sawok Mahachedi in pink is dedicated to the Bhikkhus (male Buddhist monastics). The Phra Ariya Sawok Phiksunee Sangha Mahachedi in green is dedicated to the Bhikkhunīs (female Buddhist monastics). The Phra Patchek Phothisamphuttha Mahachedi in purple is dedicated to the Pratyekabuddha (those who have attained Enlightenment but did not preach). The Phra Borom Chakrawadiraja Mahachedi in pale blue is dedicated to the Chakravarti (the universal ruler). The Phra Photisat Krisda Mahachedi in red is dedicated to the Bodhisattvas (the Buddha is his past lives). The Phra Sri Ayametaya Mahachedi in yellow is dedicated to the Maitreya (the future Buddha).

==Ramakien gallery==

The gallery or Phra Rabiang () is a covered corridor, walled on one side, that surrounds the entire temple like a cloister. Murals on the gallery walls depict the entire arc of the &quot;Ramakien&quot; epic, which is based on the Indian &quot;Ramayana&quot;. This version was translated and recomposed in Thai poetic form under the supervision of Rama I himself around 1797. The story is divided into five long episodes. The murals were commissioned by Rama I to tell his version of the epic. In fact, the main decorative theme throughout the temple is the &quot;Ramakien&quot; story. The concept of righteous kingship within the epic has long been recognised within Southeast Asia and has been appropriated by many kings to equate their countries with the legendary city of Ayodhya and the titular hero Rama. The murals were erased and completely repainted by the orders of Rama III. Ever since then they have been frequently restored. The murals along the walls are divided into 178 scenes with abbreviated synopses of the scenes below. The first scene depicted is to the right of Gate No. 7, the Wihan Yot Gate.


==Gates==

The temple wall has seven gates, two on the east side, one on the south, three on the west and one on the north. The first gate on the east is Gate No.1, the front Koei Sadet Gate, which is directly opposite the Prasat Phra Thep Bidon. This important gate was built by Rama IV. The gate is the only one topped with a crown-shaped spire. Outside the gate, there is a small resting pavilion and an elephant mounting platform. Gate No. 2, the Na Wua Gate, stands opposite the entrance of the Ubosot. On the south side is Gate No. 3, the Si Rattana Satsada Gate; this gate connects the temple to the Middle court of the Grand Palace, and visitors exit the temple from this gate. On the west side there are three gates, the southernmost being Gate No. 4, the Hermit Gate, named after the hermit statue directly opposite. This gate is the main entrance for visitors into the temple. Gate No. 5 is the rear Koei Sadet Gate, which is the middle gate on the western side, on the outside there is also a resting pavilion and an elephant mounting platform. This gate is usually shut as it is the gate the king uses when he enters the temple to perform ceremonies. Gate No. 6, the Sanam Chai Gate, is named for the small field outside the gate in the outer court of the Grand Palace. On the northern side is Gate No. 7, the Wihan Yot Gate; this gate stands opposite its namesake. It is the only gate without guardian giants.

===Guardians===
Statues of twelve &quot;yaksha&quot; (or giants) guard six of the temple&#x27;s gates along three sides of the wall (all sides except the north). The giants are characters from the &quot;Ramakien&quot; epic, each distinguished by their skin colour and crowns. Each giant is about tall, all clenching a mace or gada in front of them. Starting with the left giant in front of Gate No.1, the front Koei Sadet Gate, and going clockwise around the temple wall, Suriyaphop is red with a bamboo shoot crown, Intarachit is green with a similar crown, Mangkonkan is green with a Naga crown, Wirunhok is dark blue with a similar crown, Thotsakhirithon is dark red with an elephant&#x27;s trunk instead of a nose and a bamboo shoot crown, Thotsakhiriwan is green with a similar nose and crown, Chakkrawat is white with a smaller head on the top of his crown of feathers, Atsakanmala is purple with a similar extra head but a normal crown, Thotsakan is green with two tiers of smaller heads on top of his crown, Sahatsadecha is white with multiple heads, Maiyarap is light purple with a cockerel&#x27;s tail crown and Wirunchambang is dark blue with a similar crown.

<doc id="197415" wikidata="Q474960" url="?curid=197415" title="Reign in Blood">
<text>Reign in Blood is the third studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released on October 20, 1986, by Def Jam Recordings. The album was the band&#x27;s first collaboration with producer Rick Rubin, whose input helped the band&#x27;s sound evolve. The release date of the album was delayed because of concerns regarding the lyrical subject matter of the opening track &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, which refers to Josef Mengele and describes acts such as human experimentation that he committed at the Auschwitz concentration camp. The band&#x27;s members stated that they did not condone Nazism and were merely interested in the subject.

&quot;Reign in Blood&quot; was well received by both critics and fans, and was responsible for bringing Slayer to the attention of a mainstream metal audience. It is often mentioned among the greatest heavy metal records ever. Alongside Anthrax&#x27;s &quot;Among the Living&quot;, Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot;, and Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; helped define the sound of the emerging US thrash metal scene in the mid-1980s, and has remained influential since. The album was Slayer&#x27;s first to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 94, and was certified Gold in 1992. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 287 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In their 2017 listing of the 100 Greatest Metal albums of all time, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; at number six. 

==Background==
Slayer composed the material for &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; following their return from a tour of Europe. Guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman wrote much of the album&#x27;s music on their own, and quickly taught it to drummer Dave Lombardo. The band recorded instrumental demos of the songs (which King described as &quot;just the best 10 songs we had at that point&quot;) and took them to Brian Slagel, the band&#x27;s manager at the time.

Following the positive reception Slayer&#x27;s previous release &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; had received, the band&#x27;s producer and manager Brian Slagel realized the band were in a position to hit the &quot;big time&quot; with their next album. Slagel negotiated with several record labels, among them Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons&#x27; Def Jam Recordings. However, Slagel was reluctant to have the band signed to what was at the time primarily a hip hop label. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo was made aware of Rubin&#x27;s interest, and he initiated contact with the producer. However, Slayer&#x27;s remaining members were apprehensive of leaving Metal Blade Records, with whom they were already under contract.

Lombardo contacted Columbia Records, which was Def Jam&#x27;s distributor, and managed to get in touch with Rubin, who along with photographer Glen E. Friedman agreed to attend one of the band&#x27;s concerts. Friedman had produced Suicidal Tendencies&#x27;s self-titled debut album, in which Slayer vocalist Tom Araya made a guest appearance in the music video for the album&#x27;s single &quot;Institutionalized&quot;, pushing Suicidal Tendencies&#x27;s vocalist Mike Muir. Around this time, Rubin asked Friedman if he knew Slayer.

Guitarist Jeff Hanneman was surprised by Rubin&#x27;s interest in the band, and was impressed by his work with the hip hop acts Run-DMC and LL Cool J. During a visit by Slagel to a European music convention, Rubin spoke with the band directly, and persuaded them to sign with Def Jam. Slagel paid a personal tribute to Rubin, and said that Rubin was the most passionate of all the label representatives the band were in negotiations with. Following the agreement, Friedman brought the band members to Seattle for two days of publicity shots, possible record shots, and photos for a tour book; Rubin felt no good photos of the band had been taken before that point. One of the photos was used on the back cover of the band&#x27;s 1988 release &quot;South of Heaven&quot;.

===Cover art===
The cover artwork was designed by Larry Carroll, who at the time was creating political illustrations for &quot;The Progressive&quot;, &quot;Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Carroll was hired at Rubin&#x27;s behest. Despite its warm reception, the band members themselves originally did not like the image. King said, &quot;Nobody in the band wanted that cover. We were stuck with it.&quot; He even described the artist as a &quot;warped demented freak,&quot; although Carroll went on to make cover arts for their next two albums, &quot;South of Heaven&quot; (1988) and &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot; (1990), as well as &quot;Christ Illusion&quot; (2006). By a differing account, Araya recalled that he &quot;thought it was amazing&quot; and &quot;liked it immediately&quot;. He also stated that there were three different variations of the album cover in its conceptual stages, with the final version incorporating elements of all three.

It was believed that Columbia Records initially refused to release &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; because of the disturbing imagery. Araya refuted this claim in 2016 saying that it was because of the song &quot;Angel of Death&quot; and it had nothing to do with the cover art.

===Recording and production===
&quot;Reign in Blood&quot; was recorded and produced at Hit City West in Los Angeles with Rubin producing and Andy Wallace engineering. The album was the label boss&#x27; first professional experience with heavy metal, and his fresh perspective led to a drastic makeover of Slayer&#x27;s sound. Steve Huey of AllMusic believed Rubin drew tighter and faster songs from the band, and delivered a cleanly produced sound that contrasted sharply with their previous recordings. This resulted in drastic changes to Slayer&#x27;s sound, and changed audiences&#x27; perception of the band. Araya has since stated their two previous releases were not up to par production-wise.
Guitarist Kerry King later remarked that &quot;[i]t was like, &#x27;Wow—you can hear everything, and those guys aren&#x27;t just playing fast; those notes are on time.&#x27;&quot;

According to Araya, it was Hanneman&#x27;s idea to add the scream for the introduction in &quot;Angel of Death.&quot; Araya did several takes but ended up using the first one. By a differing account, Araya stated the scream was done in two takes, with the second take going on to appear on the album.

The album&#x27;s production is noted by the band Rubin&#x27;s omission of reverberation, which King said made the album sound &quot;way more threatening&quot;. He compared the band&#x27;s use of reverb on previous releases to the likes of Venom and Merciful Fate, saying &quot;we played in Reverb Land, for a lack of a better term.&quot; Upon hearing the album&#x27;s mix, King said the band &quot;[was] like, &#x27;why didn&#x27;t we think of that before?&#x27;&quot; Rubin himself said, &quot;when I hear very fast music like Metallica, and the sounds are big sounds… the whole thing gets blurry, and you can&#x27;t really hear it [...] If the music you&#x27;re playing is fast and if the sounds are big, there&#x27;s not enough space for those big sounds to happen next to each other. There&#x27;s no punctuation; it becomes a blur [...] I didn&#x27;t want it to be a blur of bass; I wanted it to be a pulse.&quot; Rubin&#x27;s lack of experience as a heavy metal producer at the time allowed him to work outside the general tropes of the genre. He said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have the baggage of what the old way of doing it was [...] And in this case, these forms of music were so new that the old way would&#x27;ve lessened their impact. It wouldn&#x27;t have made them better.&quot; He limited his use of studio effects to what he felt was absolutely necessary. Rubin&#x27;s approach to the album&#x27;s production resulted in a &quot;stripped-back, punchy&quot; sound.

Hanneman later admitted that while the band was listening to Metallica and Megadeth at the time, they were finding the repetition of guitar riffs tiring. He said, &quot;If we do a verse two or three times, we&#x27;re already bored with it. So we weren&#x27;t trying to make the songs shorter—that&#x27;s just what we were into,&quot; which resulted in the album&#x27;s short duration of 29 minutes. The band realized the album&#x27;s runtime only when they were finishing up with its mixing with engineer Andy Wallace. The band weren&#x27;t sure whether they would have to hit the studio to create more material or just leave it, so they turned to Rubin. &quot;His only reply was that it had 10 songs, verses, choruses and leads and that&#x27;s what constituted an album. He didn&#x27;t have any issue with it,&quot; Araya told Metal Hammer.

King had stated that while hour-long records seem to be the trend, &quot;[y]ou could lose this part; you could cut this song completely, and make a much more intense record, which is what we&#x27;re all about.&quot; When the record was completed, the band met with Rubin, who asked: &quot;Do you realize how short this is?&quot; Slayer members looked at each other, and replied: &quot;So what?&quot; The entire album was on one side of a cassette; King stated it was &quot;neat&quot;, as &quot;You could listen to it, flip it over, and play it again.&quot; The music is abrasive and faster than previous releases, helping to narrow the gap between thrash metal and its predecessor hardcore punk, and is played at an average of 220 beats per minute.

===Lombardo&#x27;s departure===

Following the album&#x27;s recording sessions, Slayer embarked on the &quot;Reign in Pain&quot; tour with the bands Overkill in the United States and Malice in Europe; they also served as the opening act for W.A.S.P.&#x27;s U.S. tour in 1987. In late 1986, drummer Lombardo quit the band. To continue the tour Slayer enlisted Whiplash drummer Tony Scaglione.

Rubin called Lombardo daily to insist he return, telling him: &quot;Dude, you gotta come back in the band.&quot; Rubin offered Lombardo a salary, but he was still hesitant about returning; at this point Lombardo had been out of the band for several months. Lombardo returned in 1987; Rubin came to his house and picked him up in his Porsche, taking him to a Slayer rehearsal.

==Critical reception==

Although the album received no radio airplay, it was the band&#x27;s first release to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it debuted at #127, and attained its peak position of 94 in its sixth week. The album also reached #47 on the UK Album Chart, and on November 20, 1992, it was certified gold in the US.
&quot;Reign in Blood&quot; was critically acclaimed by the underground and mainstream music press. Reviewing for AllMusic, Steve Huey awarded the album five out of five, describing it a &quot;stone-cold classic.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; critic Clay Jarvis awarded the album an A+ grade, calling it a &quot;genre-definer,&quot; as well as &quot;the greatest metal album of all time.&quot; Jarvis further remarked the song &quot;Angel of Death&quot; &quot;smokes the asses of any band playing fast and/or heavy today. Lyrically outlining the horrors to come, while musically laying the groundwork for the rest of the record: fast, lean and filthy.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine described it as the &quot;heaviest album of all time,&quot; and listed the album at #27 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine named it &quot;the best metal album of the last 20 years&quot; in 2006. &quot;Q Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; among their list of the &quot;50 Heaviest Albums of All Time&quot;, and &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; ranked the album #67 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005&quot;. Critic Chad Bowar stated: &quot;1986&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; is probably the best thrash album ever recorded.&quot; In August 2014, &quot;Revolver&quot; placed the album on its &quot;14 Thrash Albums You Need to Own&quot; list. In 2017, it was ranked 6th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

Adrien Begrand of PopMatters observed that &quot;[t]here&#x27;s no better song to kick things off than the masterful &#x27;Angel of Death&#x27;, one of the most monumental songs in metal history, where guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs, drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded, and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya screams and snarls his tale of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele.&quot; When asked why &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; has retained its popularity, King replied: &quot;If you released &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; today, no one would give a shit. It was timing; it was a change in sound. In thrash metal at that time, no one had ever heard good production on a record like that. It was just a bunch of things that came together at once.&quot; &quot;Decibel&quot; inducted &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame in November 2004, being the first album to earn such award.

==Legacy==
&quot;Reign in Blood&quot; is regarded by critics as one of the most influential and extreme thrash metal albums. In its &quot;Greatest Metal Bands Of All Time&quot; poll, MTV praised Slayer&#x27;s &quot;downtuned rhythms, infectious guitar licks, graphically violent lyrics and grisly artwork,&quot; which they stated &quot;set the standard for dozens of emerging thrash bands,&quot; while &quot;Slayer&#x27;s music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal.&quot; MTV described &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; as essential listening, and the album was ranked number 7 on IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 Most Influential Metal Albums&quot;.
Asked during a press tour for 1994&#x27;s &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; about the pressure of living up to &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, King replied that the band did not try to better it, but just wanted to make music. In 2006, &quot;Blabbermouth&quot;&#x27;s Don Kaye drew a comparison to the band&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Christ Illusion&quot;, and concluded, &quot;Slayer may never make an album as incendiary as &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; again.&quot;

Rapper Necro was heavily influenced by the album, and has remarked that it takes him back to the 1980s, &quot;when shit was pure&quot;. Ektomorf vocalist Zoltán Farkas describes the album as one of his primary influences. Paul Mazurkiewicz of Cannibal Corpse stated Lombardo&#x27;s performance on the album helped him play faster throughout his career.
Kelly Shaefer of Atheist said: &quot;When &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; came out it changed everything! That is easily the best extreme metal record ever!&quot;

Hanneman said that the album was his personal favorite, reasoning it was &quot;so short and quick and to the point&quot;.

Paul Bostaph – Slayer&#x27;s drummer from 1992 to 2001, and from 2013 to 2019 – first heard the record while a member of Forbidden. At a party, he walked towards music he heard from another room, and approached Forbidden guitarist Craig Locicero. Asked what was playing, Locicero shouted, &quot;The new Slayer record.&quot; After listening closely, Bostaph looked at Locicero, and concluded his band was &quot;fucked&quot;.

Oderus Urungus of Gwar cited &#x27;Altar of Sacrifice&#x27; as his favourite Slayer song: &quot;It&#x27;s the one I would always play for my friends when I was getting into Slayer. They would get this glazed look in their eyes and worship the speakers while doing the devil-horn thing.&quot;

In 2006, the album won a &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; award for Best Album of the Last 20 Years. That same year, the album&#x27;s cover art was featured in &quot;Blender Magazine&quot;&#x27;s 2006 &quot;top ten heavy metal album covers of all time.&quot;

In 2005, &quot;Rock Hard&quot; ranked the album at number six on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time.&quot; In 2016, &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; #1 among Slayer&#x27;s eleven studio albums. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 287 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

==Live performances==

The tracks &quot;Raining Blood&quot; and &quot;Angel of Death&quot; have become almost permanent additions to Slayer&#x27;s live set, and were Hanneman&#x27;s favorite tracks to play live. The band played &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; in its entirety throughout the fall of 2004, under the tour banner &quot;Still Reigning&quot;. In 2004, a live DVD of the same name was released, which included a finale with the band covered in fake blood during the performance of &quot;Raining Blood&quot;.

King later said that while the idea of playing &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; in its entirety was suggested before by their booking agency, it was met with little support. The band ultimately decided they needed to add more excitement to their live shows, and to avoid repetition incorporated the ideas of raining blood. When asked about using fake blood in future performances, King remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s time to move on, but never say never. I know Japan never saw it, South America and Australia never saw it. So you never know.&quot; In 2008 the band performed &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; in its entirety once again, this time in Paris, France, during the third European Unholy Alliance Tour.

Although it was omitted from a number of concerts because of short time allotments, Slayer have often said that they enjoy playing the album in its entirety. According to Hanneman: &quot;We still enjoy playing these songs live. We play these songs over and over and over, but they&#x27;re good songs, intense songs! If it were melodic songs or some kind of boring &#x27;clap your hands&#x27; song, you&#x27;d be going crazy playing those every night. But our songs are just bam-bam-bam-bam, they&#x27;re intense.&quot; The band was on stage for 70 minutes, which allowed only seven or eight additional songs to be played following the album&#x27;s play. King stated this arrangement &quot;alienates too many people&quot;. In the Unholy Alliance Tour of 2004, however, the album was played in its entirety during Slayer&#x27;s set as the last ten songs to end the show. The album was performed live at the I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror London festival in May 2012. In May 2014, it was announced that Slayer would perform the album in its entirety at Riot Fest in Chicago and Denver.

==Controversy==
===Lyrical themes===

Def Jam&#x27;s distributor, Columbia Records, refused to distribute the album due to the song &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, because of its setting and description of the Holocaust. &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; was eventually distributed by Geffen Records; however, due to the controversy it did not appear on Geffen&#x27;s release schedule and the Geffen logo was not put on the album.

For the album, Slayer decided to abandon much of the earlier Satanic themes explored on their previous album &quot;Hell Awaits&quot;, and write about issues that were more on a street level. &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;&#x27;s lyrics include death, religion, insanity, and murder, while the lead track &quot;Angel of Death&quot; details human experiments conducted at the Auschwitz concentration camp by Josef Mengele, who was dubbed &quot;the Angel of death&quot; by inmates. The song led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing and racism, which have followed the band throughout their career.

Hanneman was inspired to write &quot;Angel of Death&quot; after he read a number of books on Mengele during a Slayer tour. Hanneman has complained people usually misinterpret the lyrics, and clarified: &quot;Nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man, because to me — well, isn&#x27;t that obvious? I shouldn&#x27;t have to tell you that.&quot; The band utilized the controversy to attract publicity, incorporating the Reichsadler into their logo (also the S in the band&#x27;s name resembles the Sig runes used by the SS), and writing a song in &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; titled &quot;SS-3&quot; --- which depicts Reinhard Heydrich, the second in command in the Schutzstaffel, his assassination by the Czechoslovak Resistance, and the bloody reprisals for it.

==Song covers==
&quot;Raining Blood&quot; was covered by Tori Amos on her 2001 album &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot;. King has admitted that he thought the cover was odd: &quot;It took me a minute and a half to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It&#x27;s so weird. If she had never told us, we would have never known. You could have played it for us and we&#x27;d have been like, &#x27;What&#x27;s that?&#x27; Like a minute and a half through I heard a line and was like, &#x27;I know where she&#x27;s at!&#x27;&quot;. The band, however, liked the cover enough to send Slayer T-shirts to her. The song was also covered by Malevolent Creation, Chimaira, Vader, Dokaka, Reggie and the Full Effect and Killick Erik Hinds, who covered the entire album on a H&#x27;arpeggione. &quot;Raining Blood&quot; was also covered by the New Zealand drum and bass band Concord Dawn on their 2003 album &quot;Uprising&quot;, and by Nashville, Tennessee band Asschapel on their 7&quot; &quot;Satanation&quot;. A medley of &quot;Raining Blood&quot; and &quot;Postmortem&quot; appears on Body Count&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Bloodlust&quot;, preceded by a short monologue by lead singer Ice-T where he names Slayer as both a major influence on Body Count and as one of his favorite bands of all time &quot;and always will be&quot;; a video for Body Count&#x27;s version was released in August 2017.

In 2005, the Slayer tribute band Dead Skin Mask released an album with eight Slayer tracks, including &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. The death metal band Monstrosity covered the song in 1999, while the track was featured on the classical band Apocalyptica&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Amplified / A Decade of Reinventing the Cello&quot;. A Slayer tribute album titled &quot;Al Sur del Abismo (Tributo Argentino a Slayer)&quot;, compiled by Hurling Metal Records, featured sixteen tracks covered by Argentina metal bands, including Asinesia&#x27;s version of &quot;Angel of Death&quot;.

==Popular culture==
&quot;Raining Blood&quot; was featured in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode, &quot;Die Hippie, Die&quot;, which aired on March 16, 2005. The plot centers on the town of South Park, which has been overrun by hippies. Eric Cartman states &quot;Hippies can&#x27;t stand death metal&quot; and proceeds to drill through a hippie concert onto the main stage to change the audio to &quot;Raining Blood&quot;, making the hippies run away. King found the episode humorous and expressed his appreciation for the show, ending the interview with &quot;It was good to see the song being put to good use, if we can horrify some hippies we&#x27;ve done our job.&quot; &quot;Angel of Death&quot; also appears in several movies, including &quot;Gremlins 2&quot;, at the point when the character Mohawk turns into a spider, &quot;&quot;, where it is played during a car stunt scene, and in the 2005 Iraq War documentary &quot;Soundtrack to War&quot;.

&quot;Angel of Death&quot; was featured in the multi–platform video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot;. Nolan Nelson, who selected the soundtrack for the game, asserts: &quot;one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever recorded. Don&#x27;t know who Slayer is? I feel sorry for you.&quot; &quot;Raining Blood&quot; is also one of the songs featured in &quot;Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock&quot; and later &quot;Guitar Hero Smash Hits&quot;, and is considered one of the most difficult songs in the game, if not the hardest of the career song list.
&quot;Angel of Death&quot; and &quot;Raining Blood&quot; are both available as DLC for &quot;Rocksmith 2014&quot; and for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; series.

In season 1, episode 6 of &quot;The Leftovers&quot;, the character Nora Durst (played by Carrie Coon) pays a prostitute to shoot her in the chest while she wears a Kevlar vest, playing &quot;Angel of Death&quot; to mask the sound of gunfire.

<text>The autographic system for roll film was launched by Kodak in 1914, and allowed the photographer to add written information on the film at the time of exposure. 

The system was patented by Henry Jacques Gaisman, inventor and safety razor manufacturer. George Eastman purchased the rights for US$300,000. It consisted of a tissue-like carbon paper sandwiched between the film and the paper backing. Text was entered using a metal stylus, and would appear in the margin of the processed print. The system was common on early consumer cameras but became unpopular in the 1920s, and was discontinued in 1932.

Kodak&#x27;s autographic films had &quot;A&quot; as the first part of the film size designation. Thus, standard 122 film would be labeled &quot;122&quot; and autographic 122 would be &quot;A122&quot;. Autographic roll film sizes were A116, A118, A120, A122, A123, A126, A127, and A130. The autographic feature was marketed as having no extra charge. In 1915, Kodak also sold upgrade autographic backs for their existing cameras.

<doc id="197419" wikidata="Q1385567" url="?curid=197419" title="Martin Creed">
<text>Martin Creed (born 21 October 1968) is a British artist, composer and performer. He won the Turner Prize in 2001 for exhibitions during the preceding year, with the jury praising his audacity for exhibiting a single installation, &quot;Work No. 227: The lights going on and off&quot;, in the Turner Prize show. Creed lives and works in London.
==Life and education ==
Martin Creed was born in Wakefield, England. He moved with his family to Glasgow at age 3 when his silversmith father got a job teaching there. He grew up revering art and music. His parents were Quakers, and he was taken often to Quaker meetings. He attended Lenzie Academy, and studied art at the Slade School of Art at University College London from 1986 to 1990. Since then he has lived in London, apart from a period (2000—2004) living in Alicudi, an island off Sicily in the South of Italy. He currently lives and works back in London.

== Work ==

Films, installations, paintings, theatre and live-action sculptures are all characteristic of his work. Making use of whatever medium seems suitable. Since 1987 he has numbered each of his works, and most of his titles are descriptive: for example &quot;Work No. 79: some Blu-tack kneaded, rolled into a ball and depressed against a wall&quot; (1993) and &quot;Work No. 88, a sheet of A4 paper crumpled into a ball&quot; (1995). Creed&#x27;s work &quot;Work No. 200: Half the air in a given space&quot; (1998) is a room which has half of its cubic space filled with balloons.
===Projects===
Creed won the 2001 Turner Prize for two exhibitions, &quot;Martin Creed Works&quot; and &quot;Art Now: Martin Creed&quot; shown across England during the preceding year. His submission for the Turner Prize show at the Tate Gallery was &quot;Work No. 227: The lights going on and off&quot;. The work was an empty room in which the lights switched on and off at 5-second intervals. This created a great deal of press attention, most of it questioning whether something as minimalist as this could be considered art at all. Nevertheless, the jury praised this work, saying they &quot;admired the audacity in presenting a single work in the exhibition and noted its strength, rigour, wit and sensitivity to the site&quot;. His work has often excited controversy: a visitor threw eggs at the walls of Creed&#x27;s empty room as a protest against the prize, declaring that Creed&#x27;s presentations were not real art and that &quot;painting is in danger of becoming an extinct skill in this country&quot;. In recent years Creed has been exhibiting paintings in nearly every exhibition he has done.

&quot;Work No. 1197: All the bells in the country rung as quickly and as loudly as possible for three minutes&quot; was commissioned to herald the start of the 2012 Summer Olympics.

In 2009, he wrote and choreographed &quot;Work No. 1020: Ballet&quot;, a live performance of Creed&#x27;s music, ballet, words and film, originally produced by Sadler&#x27;s Wells, London and performed in the Lilian Baylis Studio. In 2010, &quot;Work No. 1020: Ballet&quot; was performed at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and at The Kitchen, New York, in December 2013. &quot;Work No. 1020&quot; was also performed in 2014 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in connection with Creed&#x27;s retrospective at the Hayward Gallery, London. He designed a work for Victoria Beckham&#x27;s store on Dover Street in Mayfair, London in 2015.

Many of his works are on free public view, like the Scotsman Steps in Edinburgh, DON&#x27;T WORRY at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Cologne, The singing lifts at The Royal Festival Hall, London, and also at the Centro Botin in Santander, and the huge spinning sign MOTHERS on a roof in Fort Worth, Texas.

Many works too are in Museum collections worldwide, from the floor work at Colleccion Jumex in Mexico City (permanently installed) to The lights going on and off at the Museum of Modern Art New York.

&#x27;Work No. 1000&#x27; consists of 1000 hand prints made with broccoli, and exemplifies Creed&#x27;s funny, child-like approach turned up to eleven.
Creed continues to exhibit work internationally and regularly gives talks and plays live with his band.

=== Permanent installations ===
Creed&#x27;s &quot;Work No. 975 EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT,&quot; was installed on the facade of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in November 2009. Although &quot;Work No. 975&quot; is a unique sculpture, the phrase has been used on several related works, each assigned its own work number. Previous to &quot;Work No. 975,&quot; a red neon text appeared in New York&#x27;s Times Square (&quot;Work No.225&quot; 1999, commissioned by Public Art Fund), a thirty-metre-long version was installed in Detroit (&quot;Work No.790&quot; 2007), and another text in white neon ran the 23 metre length of the Rennie Museum&#x27;s façade in Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown (&quot;Work No.851&quot; 2008). Most recently, a 46-metre multicoloured version was commissioned for Christchurch Art Gallery, in the advent of its reopening after almost five years of earthquake-related closure.

In 2011, Creed was commissioned by Fruitmarket Gallery to make a work as part of the restoration of the historic Scotsman Steps in Edinburgh. Creed&#x27;s &quot;Work No. 1059&quot; was subsequently installed, cladding each of the 104 steps and landings in a different type of marble. &quot;Guardian&quot; art critic Jonathan Jones called it &quot;a generous, modest masterpiece of contemporary public art&quot;.

In 2012, Creed was the first artist to participate in the long-term programme of artist-conceived restaurants at Sketch, London. Together with a series of paintings and wall drawings, Creed specifically created &quot;Work No. 1343&quot; where every single piece of cutlery, glass, chair and table was different and brought together a mix of the mass-produced and hand-crafted, from classic antiques to contemporary design from all around the world. &quot;Work No. 1347,&quot; still on display at the restaurant, consists of 96 different types of marble, in a herringbone formation across the floor.

In 2019, &quot;Work No. 2950: WHATEVER&quot; was placed on the roof of a building in Auckland, New Zealand. It is a large multicoloured neon sign showing the word “WHATEVER”.

===Music===
Creed&#x27;s first band, Owada, was formed in 1994 with Adam McEwen and Keiko Owada. In 1997, they released their first CD, &quot;Nothing&quot;, on David Cunningham&#x27;s Piano label. Sound has also featured in his gallery-based work, with pieces using doorbells, drum machines and metronomes. Since 1999 he has not used the band name &quot;Owada&quot;. In 2000, he published a recording of his songs titled &quot;I Can&#x27;t Move&quot; under his own name with the arts publisher Art Metropole, in Toronto.

In 2010, he provided the cover art for a Futuristic Retro Champions single, while supporting its launch with an appearance with his own band with Keiko Owada on bass, Genevieve Murphy on keyboards, Ben Kane on drums and Anouchka Grose on steel guitar.

Creed started his own label, Telephone Records, and released the single &quot;Thinking/ Not Thinking&quot; in early 2011, following it up with the single &quot;Where You Go&quot; in 2012. Releases accelerated in 2012, with the Double AA Side single &quot;Fuck Off&quot; and &quot;Die&quot; coming out on Moshi Moshi Records in May 2012, in advance of the album &quot;Love To You&quot;, released on Moshi Moshi in July 2012. The album is produced by David Cunningham, Martin Creed and The Nice NIce Boys (Andrew Knowles of Johnny Marr &amp; The Healers and Nick McCarthy of Franz Ferdinand). The Vinyl Factory worked with Creed to produce a limited edition of the release which featured hand-painted covers by Creed. The single &quot;You&#x27;re The One For Me&quot; came out at the same time as the album.

January 2014 saw the release &quot;Mind Trap&quot;, an album that featured songs alongside instrumental pieces for orchestra. Creed sings and plays the instruments, supported by gospel singers Dee Alexander and Yvonne Gage (who have worked with The Police, Madonna and R.Kelly) and Andy Knowles (musical credits include stints with the Fiery Furnaces &amp; Franz Ferdinand) playing drums on If You&#x27;re Lonely, You Return and Don&#x27;t Tell Me. Keiko Owada plays bass on Gift Attack / Don&#x27;t Won&#x27;t. Co-produced by Martin with Andy Knowles, the album was recorded in London, Chicago and the Czech Republic. Nick McCarthy of Franz Ferdinand and Mark Ralph (who works with Hot Chip) provided additional production. The Chicago songs, which form the heart of the album, were recorded all-analogue at John McEntire&#x27;s (Tortoise) Soma Studios. Engineered by Bill Skibbe (The Kills/Franz Ferdinand). It also includes 3 specially commissioned orchestral works: &quot;Work No. 955&quot; was originally written for the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, &quot;Work No. 994&quot; was composed for the Hiroshima Symphony Orchestra and &quot;Work No. 1375&quot; was commissioned by the London Sinfonietta. These pieces were recorded for the album by the Brno Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mikel Toms. All lyrics and music on the album are written by Martin Creed, with the exception of the New Shutters which is Martin&#x27;s arrangement of a traditional Neapolitan folk song. The album sleeve features one of Martin&#x27;s paintings, &quot;Work No. 1674: Anouchka&quot; and was designed by Andy Knowles, who has recently directed videos for Franz Ferdinand and The Cribs. Martin Creed is also much loved by Franz Ferdinand - regular attendees at his gigs and co-producers on his album &#x27;Mind Trap&#x27; - as well as Moshi Moshi label-mates Slow Club.

A new body of audiovisual work was released in late November 2015 in response to the Syrian refugee crisis. The double A-side single “Let Them In / Border Control” was made available via Telephone Records as free downloads on SoundCloud. Both songs are accompanied by videos which Creed made himself.

In July 2016, Martin Creed released a new album entitled &quot;Thoughts Lined Up&quot;. The album includes the singles &quot;Understanding&quot; and &quot;Princess Taxi Girl&quot; for which accompanying videos have been released.

=== Discography ===
===On art===

In an interview published in the 2002 book &quot;Art Now: Interviews with Modern Artists&quot;, Creed explains that he used to &#x27;make paintings&#x27; but never liked having to decide what to paint. He decided to stop making paintings and instead to think about what it meant, and why he wanted to make things. He says:

Creed says that he makes art works not as part of an academic exploration of &#x27;conceptual&#x27; art, but rather from a wish to connect with people, &#x27;wanting to communicate and wanting to say hello&#x27;. The work is therefore primarily emotional:

==Exhibitions==
In 1996, Richard Long and Roger Ackling selected Creed to exhibit at EASTinternational. In the decade since winning the Turner Prize he has exhibited extensively throughout the world, including large survey shows at Trussardi Foundation, Milan (&#x27;I Like Things&#x27;), Bard College, New York (&#x27;Feelings&#x27;), and a touring exhibition which started at Ikon Gallery Birmingham and toured to Hiroshima and Seoul. 
The first major survey show of Creed&#x27;s, &#x27;What&#x27;s the point of it?&#x27;, took place at the Hayward Gallery, London, in January 2014. The exhibition included a number of his best-known works, from the installation &quot;Work No. 227 The Lights Going On and Off&quot; (2000), &quot;Work No. 293 A sheet of paper crumpled into a ball&quot; (2003), to his epic sculpture &quot;Work No. 1092 MOTHERS&quot; (2011). Coinciding with the exhibition at the Hayward, the Southbank Centre commissioned Martin to compose a new piece for the Royal Festival Hall organ, resulting in &quot;Work No&quot;. &quot;1815,&quot; a performance alongside some of J.S Bach&#x27;s greatest organ works.

Creed&#x27;s largest survey show to date took place at Park Avenue Armory, New York from June - August 2016, curated by Tom Eccles and Hans-Ulrich Obrist. Entitled ’The Back Door,’ using both the Wade Thompson Drill Hall and the historic interiors of the building, the show brought together a sequence of works from Creed&#x27;s more than 20-year career.

In 2017 he had an exposition in Museum Voorlinden in the Netherlands titled &quot;Say Cheese&quot;. In this exhibition he showed a wall with 1000 broccoli prints in various colors, he filled a room with blue balloons for walking through. In another room he showed many metronomes were ticking at different speeds.

In 2019, the Centro Botín Centre held an exhibition called &quot;Amigos.&quot; It ran from 6 April to 9 June and features several new installations including one put amongst some trees which surround the building.

In 2019, the Museum of Recent Art held an exhibition called &quot;Thinking / Not Thinking&quot;. It ran from 12 February to 2 May and features several installations.

<text>Generator is the sixth studio album by the punk rock band Bad Religion. Although the album was completed in the spring of 1991, it was not released until 1992; the band was not happy with the artwork and packaging, and went through several ideas that were eventually scrapped. &quot;Generator&quot; was the band&#x27;s first release with drummer Bobby Schayer, who replaced Pete Finestone during the &quot;Against the Grain&quot; tour.

&quot;Generator&quot; includes some fan favorites and concert staples, such as, &quot;Generator&quot;, &quot;No Direction&quot;, &quot;Heaven Is Falling&quot;, &quot;Atomic Garden&quot;, and &quot;The Answer&quot;. The album was promoted with Bad Religion&#x27;s first music video, which was filmed for the song &quot;Atomic Garden&quot;.

==Background and production==

Following the release of Bad Religion&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Against the Grain&quot; (1990), drummer Pete Finestone left to focus on his other band the Fishermen. His position was filled by fan Bobby Schayer.

Writing sessions for &quot;Generator&quot; began around late 1990/early 1991. After Schayer joined in April 1991, the band immediately started work on their follow-up to &quot;Against the Grain&quot;. With an intended release date of mid-to-late 1991, they recorded it at Westbeach Recorders in Hollywood, California in May of that year.

&quot;Generator&quot; was recorded almost live in the studio, because, at the time, guitarist Brett Gurewitz had moved Westbeach to larger premises, and for the first time, the entire band could play in the studio at the same time. He stated that it was &quot;time to change&quot; and the band &quot;did it in a different studio, but as far as the songwriting, it was a deliberate effort to try something different&quot;.

&quot;Generator&quot; marked a shift in songwriting-style for the band. Although many songs hold true to their hardcore-punk roots (&quot;Generator&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot;), select tracks suggested the band moving towards a slower, more experimental route (&quot;Two Babies In The Dark&quot;, &quot;The Answer&quot;), as well as a darker one (&quot;Atomic Garden&quot;). While not as dark, this experimental period would continue through their next album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Recipe For Hate&quot;.

==Reissue==
Along with Bad Religion&#x27;s first five albums (minus &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;), Epitaph Records released a remastered version of &quot;Generator&quot; on April 6, 2004, with two exclusive tracks that were taken from the split 7-inch with Noam Chomsky, &quot;New World Order: War #1&quot;, issued by &quot;Maximum Rock&#x27;N Roll&quot; in 1991. These versions feature Finestone on drums, making it his final recordings with Bad Religion.

==Reception and awards==

Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), wrote that the band &quot;offer up complexity and experiment while the slower tempos actually let you hear what the band are singing about — a valid consideration for a band with so much to say.&quot;

According to The Bad Religion Page, 100,000 copies of the album were shipped. By April 1992, &quot;Generator&quot; had sold approximately 85,000 copies, becoming Bad Religion&#x27;s third best-selling album at the time (their previous album &quot;Against the Grain&quot; had sold 90,000 copies, while &quot;Suffer&quot; and &quot;No Control&quot; sold approximately 88,000 and 80,000 respectively).

In October 2011, the album was ranked number three on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1992.

<doc id="197431" wikidata="Q1478843" url="?curid=197431" title="Paseo de la Reforma">
<text>Paseo de la Reforma (literally &quot;Promenade of the Reform&quot;) is a wide avenue that runs diagonally across the heart of Mexico City. It was designed at the behest of Emperor Maximilian by Ferdinand von Rosenzweig during the era of the Second Mexican Empire and modeled after the great boulevards of Europe, such as the in Vienna and the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The planned grand avenue was to link the National Palace with the imperial residence, Chapultepec Castle, which was then on the southwestern edge of town. The project was originally named Paseo de la Emperatriz (&quot;Promenade of the Empress&quot;) in honor of Maximilian&#x27;s consort Empress Carlota. After the fall of the Empire and Maximilian&#x27;s subsequent execution, the Restored Republic renamed the Paseo in honor of the La Reforma.

It is now home to many of Mexico&#x27;s tallest buildings such as the Torre Mayor and others in the Zona Rosa. More modern extensions continue the avenue at an angle to the old Paseo. To the northeast it continues toward Tlatelolco, where it changes its name near the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. There it divides into Calzada de Guadalupe and Calzada de los Misterios that continue toward La Villa. Its western portion going west from Chapultepec Park passes south of Polanco on its way through the affluent neighborhood of Lomas de Chapultepec and then into Cuajimalpa and Santa Fe on the outskirts of the city, although when it reaches this point it is more a highway than a promenade.

==Description==
Today, the Reforma is filled with tourist attractions, luxury restaurants and hotels, office buildings, public art exhibitions, and new construction.

Reforma is a common location for Mexicans to celebrate or protest. Most protest rallies commonly go along Reforma from the Angel of Independence to the Zócalo, or from the Zócalo to Los Pinos. Many parades, such as Mexico City Pride, make their way through Reforma. The Angel of Independence roundabout is an iconic representative of the city, and is the main place of the celebration of victories of the national football team, such as during World Cups.

Motor vehicle traffic on the main downtown part of the Paseo shuts down most Sundays 8am-2pm as part of the &quot;Paseo Dominical Muévete en bici&quot; program of the Mexico City government.

==History==
===19th century===

In 1864, during the French intervention in Mexico, the capital and much of the country was controlled by the French, with Juárez&#x27;s republican government on the run in northern Mexico. In Mexico City Maximilian I was installed as emperor. He took up residence in Chapultepec Castle with his wife Empress Carlota. Modernizing the capital was part of a more general reform program to modernize the country. These included the building of infrastructure to improve domestic communications, including roads and railroads. One such project type was the creation of a series of boulevards, imitating European ones such as the in Vienna, or the ones under construction at that time in Paris under Napoleon III, lined with grand monuments.

Two such projects were begun, one on Avenida Chapultepec, which was never completed, and the other to connect the city center with Chapultepec Castle. The latter was named Paseo de la Emperatriz, in honor of Empress Carlota, and was to be for the personal use of the Emperor. Austrian mining engineer Alois Bolland was put in charge of the project and designed what was finally implemented.

The route and the construction of six boulevards radiating outward from the Zócalo, Mexico City&#x27;s main square, was assigned to a committee of prominent architects (Carl Gangolf and Ramón Rodríguez Arangoiti) and artists (Felipe Sojo, Miguel Noreña, Santiago Rebull). The committee&#x27;s original proposal planned. However, this would have required the demolition of large portion of the buildings in the city, as happened in Paris. The committee decided instead to begin the boulevard at what was then the edge of the city, 1.5 km west of the Zócalo, where Avenida Bucareli meets Avenida Juárez and where the Equestrian statue of Charles IV of Spain stood. From that location, the Paseo&#x27;s route led to the bottom of the royal residential area at Chapultepec Castle, where it connected to the road circling up to the castle at the top of the hill.

The Austrian engineers Bolland and Ferdinand van Rosenzweig were assigned to construct the boulevard. Originally it included two vehicle paths, 9 meters wide each, a central island 1.5 meters wide, and two pedestrian side paths, each 9 meters wide, resplendent with ornamental plants and trees. The city government and the owners of the agricultural land along the route opposed the plan. Reasons included the fragility of the land, which was reclaimed lake bed of Lake Texcoco, and that the saltiness of the soil would supposedly not support the lush vegetation required.

Despite opposition, the project continued. After a competition, it was assigned to the brothers Juan and Ramón Agea under the supervision of the Ministry of Development, Colonization, Industry and Commerce, headed by Luis Robles Pezuela. Of the original 3.15 km-long project, only one part was completed between 1864 and 1865, a road 20 meters wide, which was enormous for those days, without a central median, only a few areas on the side reserved for horses to rest. There were practically no buildings along the boulevard and sidewalks were not considered necessary.

The Paseo did not include bridges or similar constructions to cross the canals and rivers which then flowed near what is now Colonia Tabacalera (then Hacienda de la Teja). The Paseo was at this time for the exclusive use of the imperial court, a policy enforced by a dedicated police force. At the time, people with horses or horses and carriages, promenaded along the Paseo de Bucareli (today Avenida Bucareli between Avenidas Juárez and Chapultepec.

After the downfall of the Second Mexican Empire and the restoration of the republic in 1867, the Paseo de la Emperatriz was renamed Calzada Degollado in honor of General Santos Degollado and then in 1872 Paseo de la Reforma.

On February 17, 1867, the Paseo officially opened to the public while work continued on it. By 1870 it had tree-lined pedestrian medians between &quot;el Caballito&quot; and the Palm Tree Roundabout, carried out by the Ministry of Development under Francisco P. Herrera. Between 1872 and 1876 an eight-meter bridge was built at Hacienda de la Teja and the pedestrian medians were completed all the way to Chapultepec. Eucalyptus and ash trees and willows were planted and four monumental roundabouts (&quot;glorietas&quot;) were built between the Palm Tree Roundabout and Avenida Juárez. In 1872 the boulevard was renamed Paseo de la Reforma. On its flanks, upscale subdivisions were built, Colonia Americana – today Colonia Juárez, and Colonia Cuauhtémoc. The French style of the area was epitomized at the time by frequent comparisons of Paseo de la Reforma to the Champs Elysées in Paris.

Liberal general Porfirio Díaz seized president power in 1876 after having distinguished himself as a leader in the war against the French Intervention. As president, he fully supported the embellishment of the Paseo de la Reforma with statuary representing Mexico&#x27;s heroes through its history, creating &quot;monuments worth of the culture of this city, and whose sights remind of the heroism with which the nation fought against the Conquest in the sixteenth century and for the Independence and Reform in the present.&quot; Initially, liberal General Vicente Riva Palacio, grandson of liberal leader of independence Vicente Guerrero, was involved in projects to raise the capital&#x27;s profile when he served as Díaz&#x27;s Minister of Development (&quot;fomento&quot;) (1876–1879). As part of the centralizing impetus of Díaz&#x27;s government, the Paseo de la Reforma was to include statues of heroes and cultural eminences of Mexico&#x27;s constituent states, although some state leaders objected to the reassertion of traditional Mexico City&#x27;s power.

The major intersections of the broad avenue were traffic roundabouts (&quot;glorietas&quot;) where statues commemorating persons and events in Mexican history were placed over the next decades. The first monument on the Paseo was the Monument to Christopher Columbus, which had been commissioned in 1873 by wealthy Mexican railway magnate Antonio Escandón and executed by French sculptor Charles Cordier in France. It was erected in 1877, shortly after Díaz seized power. For liberals it was objectionable for its religious iconography and a second statue to Columbus was placed elsewhere in the capital in 1892. The Monument to Cuauhtémoc was a planned installation. The monument to Independence was inaugurated in 1910, during the celebrations of the centennial of the Hidalgo revolt.

==Renovation==
In 2003 Mexico City&#x27;s government started a renewal program for Paseo de la Reforma. It included the maintenance of the existent gardens and the creation of new ones, the intensive cleaning and sweeping of streets and sidewalks, the construction of new pink quarry sidewalks and benches, the creation of access bays in the Zoo, lake and Modern Art Museum for touristic and school buses, the installation of new lighting, the moving of the monument to Cuauhtémoc to the crossing of Avenida de los Insurgentes and Paseo de la Reforma, the construction of prism shaped concrete structures in the median which also have plants and flowers, the promotion of Reforma as a cultural walk organizing different expositions along the avenue sidewalks, and the maintenance of the monuments, sculptures and fountains. Also, a touristic route that goes from Chapultepec Park to the Historic Center along Reforma was established by a double deck bus called &quot;Turibus&quot;.

With the renewal project, new life has come to the avenue. It has become a main attraction of the city and the most expensive one to build on. However, after many of Mexico City&#x27;s banks and business left Paseo de la Reforma for the Santa Fe business district in the last decade, the boulevard has been the center of a real estate renaissance. Remarkable buildings built in recent years are Torre Mayor, Torre HSBC in the Ángel roundabout, Torre Libertad with a St. Regis Hotels &amp; Resorts-branded hotel in the Diana fountain roundabout, and Reforma 222 designed by Mexican architect Teodoro González de León (who designed the Auditorio Nacional) at Reforma and Havre St. Recently opened mixed-used developments include a Ritz-Carlton Hotel &amp; Residences and a Park Hyatt Hotel &amp; Residences.

In 2019, American fast food chain Shake Shack opened its first restaurant in Mexico on Reforma in front of the Angel of Independence.

From May 2007, the &quot;Paseo Dominical Muévete en bici&quot; program shuts down motor vehicle traffic Sundays 8am-2pm (except the last Sunday each month) on a route that includes Paseo de la Reforma.

===Architecture===

The Paseo de la Reforma reoriented the expansion of the city from the colonial center to an area more easily open to development for residences and businesses of the capital&#x27;s middle and upper classes, separating them from the poorer and indigenous residents of the colonial core. Development occurred especially during the President Díaz&#x27;s regime (1876–1911). Structures were of more modern and diverse architectural design. Few of these original houses built in different European architectural styles remain and office blocks have been built on their place over the years. Although there is no single block that has kept its former architecture, a couple of scattered buildings show the opulence enjoyed by the elites during Porfirio Díaz&#x27; regime.

Although most of the modern buildings are unremarkable, the Art Deco Lotería Nacional building and the functionalist IMSS building are an exception. Today Paseo de la Reforma houses offices ranging from the Mexican Federal Government to Banks and brokerage houses. The newer buildings show a mix of contemporary styles and the commonly used style for office buildings.

Five skyscrapers were recently along the boulevard between the entrance to Chapultepec Park and the Diana the Huntress Fountain: Torre Reforma (244m), Punto Chapultepec (238m), Torre BBVA Bancomer (235m), and Torre Diana (158m).

===Monuments===
Many monuments to people and events in Mexico&#x27;s history and the history of the Americas are situated on and along Reforma. The most prominent monuments are in the centers of its major traffic circles, with the monuments to Columbus, Cuauhtemoc, and the monument to Independence, &quot;El Ángel&quot; (1910), the most famous of the monuments. There is a lengthy list of statues added over the years along the broad avenue&#x27;s sides. They mainly honor Mexican liberals, as well as some writers and journalists who influenced political discourse. Guadalupe Victoria (1786–1843), military hero of independence and the first president of Mexico, is honored in a low key way considering his accomplishments. Others with name recognition in Mexican history are Fray Servando Teresa de Mier (1765–1827), Carlos Maria de Bustamante (1774–1848), historian; José María Luis Mora (1794–1850); Miguel Ramos Arizpe (1775–1843), &quot;father of Mexican federalism&quot;; Andrés Quintana Roo (1787–1851), after whom a state is named; Miguel Lerdo de Tejada (1812–1861), prominent politician in the liberal Reform; Melchor Ocampo (1814–1861), radical liberal, murdered during the War of the Reform; Guillermo Prieto (1818–1897), prominent journalist; Gabino Barreda (1818–1881), Positivist philosopher and educator; Ignacio Manuel Altamirano (1834–1893), intellectual and writer of indigenous origins; and Vicente Riva Palacio (1832–1896), liberal general, writer, and politician, who died in Spanish exile. History is written by the victors, so that absent from the array of liberal heroes are statues of prominent Mexican conservatives Antonio López de Santa Anna, general and president of Mexico for much of the early 19th century; and Lucas Alamán, historian and politician. Also absent is a statue Porfirio Díaz, liberal general and president from 1876 to 1911, when the regime was overthrown by the Mexican Revolution.

A monument, officially called the &quot;Altar to the Homeland&quot; (&quot;Altar a la Patria&quot;), honors the &quot;Niños Héroes&quot; – the Heroic Cadets of the Battle of Chapultepec – with a particularly grand monument in the entrance of Chapultepec Park. Heroes of South American independence include Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín. There is also a fountain with sculptures that commemorate the nationalization of Mexico&#x27;s oil reserves and industry in 1938, and the Diana the Huntress Fountain that includes a statue featuring the Roman goddess Diana originally named &quot;The Arrow Thrower of the North Star&quot;.

The Angel of Independence – a tall column with a gilded statue of a Winged Victory (that bears resemblance with an angel, therefore its common name) on its top and many marble statues on its base depicting the heroes of the Mexican War of Independence, built to commemorate the centennial of Mexico&#x27;s independence in 1910. The base contains the tombs of several key figures in Mexico&#x27;s war of independence.

Near the central section of Reforma, across from the Alameda, is the Monumento a la Revolución (&quot;Monument to the Revolution&quot;). This is an enormous dome supported by four arches. It was originally planned, by Porfirio Díaz, to be a part of a new parliament building, but it never was completed because of the start of the Mexican Revolution. 
After Díaz&#x27;s overthrow it became a monument to the revolution that deposed him. The remains of Francisco I. Madero and several other heroes of the Mexican Revolution are buried here.

<doc id="197433" wikidata="Q302812" url="?curid=197433" title="The B-52's (album)">
<text>The B-52&#x27;s is the debut album by American new wave band the B-52&#x27;s, released in 1979. The kitschy lyrics and mood, and the hook-laden harmonies helped establish a fanbase for the band, who went on to release several chart-topping singles. The album cover was designed by Tony Wright (credited as &quot;Sue Ab Surd&quot;).

&quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; peaked at number 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; reached number 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Shortly before his death, John Lennon said he enjoyed the album. In 2003, the television network VH1 named &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; the 99th greatest album of all time. In 2020, &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; was ranked number 198 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

==Critical reception==


&quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; album has received critical acclaim, with music reviewers praising its infectious rhythms and guitar riffs, kitschy lyrics, and party atmosphere. In July 1979, British journalist Tim Lott wrote in &quot;Record Mirror&quot; that &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; album was the best record he had heard that year. In his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau remarked on his fondness &quot;for the pop junk they recycle—with love and panache,&quot; while also noting that he was &quot;more delighted with their rhythms, which show off their Georgia roots by adapting the innovations of early funk (a decade late, just like the Stones and Chicago blues) to an endlessly danceable forcebeat format.&quot;

In the 1979 Pazz &amp; Jop year-end critics poll, &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; album was ranked number 7. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; ranked it number 12 on their critics&#x27; list of the best albums of 1979.

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote: &quot;Unabashed kitsch mavens at a time when their peers were either vulgar or stylish, the Athens quintet celebrated all the silliest aspects of pre-Beatles pop culture – bad hairdos, sci-fi nightmares, dance crazes, pastels, and anything else that sprung into their minds – to a skewed fusion of pop, surf, avant-garde, amateurish punk, and white funk.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Pat Blashill concluded: &quot;On &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot;, the best little dance band from Athens proved that rock &amp; roll still matters if it&#x27;s about sex and hair and moving your body. Even if you have to shake-bake shake-bake it like a Shy Tuna.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani stated that &quot;like any over-the-top act, the B-52&#x27;s wears thin, but the band successfully positioned themselves as pop-culture icons—not unlike the musical antiquities they emulated.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; number 152 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the ranking in a 2012 update of the list and dropping it to number 198 in a 2020 update. In 2003, VH1 named it the 99th greatest album of all time. &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; was included in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2013, it was ranked number 452 on the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; critics&#x27; list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

In 1995, &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; was named number 42 on the top 100 alternative albums list of all time by the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album number 28 on its 2013 list of 100 best debut albums of all time, dropping it to number 43 in a 2022 update. In 2023, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s staff placed &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; at number 86 on their list of the 100 greatest debut albums of all time. &quot;PopMatters&quot; magazine named it number 40 on its 2024 list of the 50 best post-punk albums ever.

== Influence ==
In January 1980, the B-52&#x27;s appeared on the TV show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where they performed &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; and &quot;Dance This Mess Around&quot;, two songs from this album. Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl mentioned seeing the B-52&#x27;s in this TV episode as a memorable moment in their preteen lives.

Stephen Malkmus, frontman of the American band Pavement, said in 2018: &quot;There&#x27;s a time in your life, when you&#x27;re 13/14, when you buy records just &#x27;cos you&#x27;re supposed to buy them. I had &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; by Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions, &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; by The Clash and this one from the B-52&#x27;s. Well. I listened to the B-52&#x27;s a thousand times, Elvis Costello like 20 times, and &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; maybe five times.&quot;

<doc id="197435" wikidata="Q138213" url="?curid=197435" title="Freedom fries">
<text>Freedom fries was a politically motivated renaming of french fries in the United States. The term was coined in February 2003 in a North Carolina restaurant, and was widely publicized a month later when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias. The political renaming occurred in context of France&#x27;s opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although some restaurants around the nation adopted the renaming, the term became unpopular, in part due to decreasing popularity of the Iraq War. After Ney&#x27;s resignation as Chairman in 2006, the change of name in congressional cafeterias was reverted.

==Background==
===French opposition to the Iraq war===
After the September 11 attacks by Al-Qaeda and the declaration of a &quot;War on Terror&quot; by President George W. Bush, an invasion of Iraq was proposed. During the United Nations Security Council deliberations, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin made it clear France would neither support nor participate in the invasion, and that it would veto any resolution that mandates an invasion of Iraq. Though Russia and China also opposed the invasion, they had not threatened to use their veto power on the Security Council; as such, France was perceived as the main barrier to the American and British effort to secure a UN mandate for invasion. This caused some Americans to accuse France of betrayal, reigniting prior anti-French sentiment in the United States.

===Initial renaming===
Renaming was initiated in February 2003 by Beaufort, North Carolina, &quot;Cubbie&#x27;s&quot; restaurant owner Neal Rowland, who said he was motivated by similar actions against Germany in World War I, when &quot;sauerkraut was called liberty cabbage, and frankfurters were renamed hot dogs.&quot; (The term &quot;hot dog&quot; was in use well before the outbreak of World War I. In fact, sauerkraut was renamed victory cabbage and Frankfurters were renamed liberty dogs.) In an interview about the name change, Rowland commented, &quot;since the French are backing down [from the war], French fries and French everything needs to be banned.&quot; In March 2007, Rowland obtained a trademark registration for the term &quot;freedom fries&quot;, which was cancelled in November 2013.

==U.S. House adoption==

On March 11, 2003, Republican U.S. Representatives Bob Ney and Walter B. Jones directed the three House cafeterias to change all references to French fries and French toast on menus, and replace them with &quot;Freedom fries&quot; and &quot;Freedom toast&quot;, respectively. Jones chose to follow Cubbie&#x27;s example by circulating a letter to his colleagues advocating their renaming because, he said, &quot;the French were &#x27;sitting on the sidelines. As Ney was Chairman of the United States House Committee on House Administration, the action did not require any vote, as the committee has authority over House cafeterias. According to a statement released by Ney, the renaming was intended to express displeasure with France&#x27;s &quot;continued refusal to stand with their U.S. allies.&quot; The statement further read: &quot;This action today is a small but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure many on Capitol Hill have with our so-called ally, France.&quot; When asked about his view on the change, Jones said it was a &quot;lighthearted gesture.&quot; This also came to apply to dining halls for the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Multi-National Force – Iraq during the U.S. occupation of Iraq.

===Reactions===
In response to the change, French Embassy spokeswoman Nathalie Loiseau commented &quot;It&#x27;s exactly a non-issue ... we focus on the serious issues&quot; and noted that fries originated in Belgium. She then remarked that France&#x27;s position on the change was that they were &quot;in a very serious moment dealing with very serious issues, and we are not focusing on the name [Americans] give to potatoes.&quot; After the name reversal, an embassy spokeswoman said: &quot;our relations are definitely much more important than potatoes ... and our relations are back on track.&quot;

In a 2005 opinion poll by Gallup, participants were asked if they felt the renaming of French fries and toast was &quot;a silly idea or a sincere expression of patriotism;&quot; 66% answered it was silly, 33% answered it was patriotic, and 1% had no opinion. However, only 15% of participants actually considered using the term &quot;freedom fries&quot;; 80% said they would continue to call them &quot;french fries&quot;. Several restaurants followed the Houses&#x27; change. As of 2020, several American restaurants still used the name &quot;freedom fries&quot;. Opposing the name change, The Saturn Cafe in Santa Cruz, California, changed their menu to &quot;Impeach George W. Bush fries.&quot; Meanwhile, Reckitt Benckiser, maker of French&#x27;s mustard, were sufficiently concerned about the movement to publicly clarify that its brand derived from a family name.
Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Barney Frank noted that the change made &quot;Congress look even sillier than it sometimes looks,&quot; New York Democratic Congressman José Serrano characterized the renaming as &quot;petty grandstanding,&quot; and urged fellow legislators to concentrate on more pressing issues.

The French American indie band Freedom Fry chose their name based on the Freedom Fries phenomenon. In 2005, Robert Plant and his band Strange Sensation released the album &quot;Mighty ReArranger&quot;, which contains the track &#x27;&quot;Freedom Fries,&quot; an anti-war song whose lyrics contains the words &quot;Freedom fries and burns and scars, the liberator goes too far.&quot;

===Policy reversal===
On August 2, 2006, the House cafeteria menus were changed back without any announcement. The change was made by the new House Administration Committee Chairman, Vern Ehlers, who replaced Ney following his resignation due to a scandal. When asked about his decision, Ehlers responded, &quot;It&#x27;s no big deal ... It&#x27;s not news.&quot; When asked in 2005 about his opinion on the &quot;freedom fries&quot; episode, Walter B. Jones responded, &quot;I wish it had never happened.&quot;

<text>A fontanelle (or fontanel) (colloquially, soft spot) is an anatomical feature of the infant human skull comprising soft membranous gaps (sutures) between the cranial bones that make up the calvaria of a fetus or an infant. Fontanelles allow for stretching and deformation of the neurocranium both during birth and later as the brain expands faster than the surrounding bone can grow. Premature complete ossification of the sutures is called craniosynostosis.

After infancy, the anterior fontanelle is known as the bregma.

==Structure==
An infant&#x27;s skull consists of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These are joined by fibrous sutures, which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth.

* Posterior fontanelle is triangle-shaped. It lies at the junction between the sagittal suture and lambdoid suture. At birth, the skull features a small posterior fontanelle with an open area covered by a tough membrane, where the two parietal bones adjoin the occipital bone (at the lambda). The posterior fontanelles ossify within 6–8 weeks after birth. This is called intramembranous ossification. The mesenchymal connective tissue turns into bone tissue.
* Anterior fontanelle is a diamond-shaped membrane-filled space located between the two frontal and two parietal bones of the developing fetal skull. It persists until approximately 18 months after birth. It is at the junction of the coronal suture and sagittal suture. The fetal anterior fontanelle may be palpated until 18 months. In cleidocranial dysostosis, however, it is often late in closing at 8–24 months or may never close. Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle.
* Two smaller fontanelles are located on each side of the head, more anteriorly the sphenoidal or anterolateral fontanelle (between the sphenoid, parietal, temporal, and frontal bones) and more posteriorly the mastoid or posterolateral fontanelle (between the temporal, occipital, and parietal bones).
During birth, fontanelles enable the bony plates of the skull to flex, allowing the child&#x27;s head to pass through the birth canal. The ossification of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close over by 9 to 18 months. The sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of life. The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium. Other than the anterior and posterior fontanelles, the mastoid fontanelle and the sphenoidal fontanelle are also significant.

===Closure===
In humans, the sequence of fontanelle closure is as follows:
# The posterior fontanelle generally closes 2 to 3 months after birth;
# The sphenoidal fontanelle is the next to close around 6 months after birth;
# The mastoid fontanelle closes next from 6 to 18 months after birth; and
# The anterior fontanelle is generally the last to close between 12 and 18 months.

==Clinical significance==
The fontanelle may pulsate, and although the precise cause of this is not known, it is normal and seems to echo the heartbeat, perhaps via the arterial pulse within the brain vasculature, or in the meninges. This pulsating action is how the soft spot got its name – fontanelle is borrowed from the old French word fontenele, which is a diminutive of fontaine, meaning &quot;spring&quot;. It is assumed that the term spring is used because of the analogy of the dent in a rock or earth where a spring arises.

Parents may worry that their infant may be more prone to injury at the fontanelles. In fact, although they may colloquially be called &quot;soft-spots&quot;, the membrane covering the fontanelles is extremely tough and difficult to penetrate.

Fontanelles allow the infant brain to be imaged using ultrasonography. Once they are closed, most of the brain is inaccessible to ultrasound imaging, because the bony skull presents an acoustic barrier.

==Disorders==
===Bulging===
A very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure. Increased cranial pressure in infants may cause the fontanelles to bulge or the head to begin to enlarge abnormally. It can occur due to:
* Craniosynostosis – premature fusion of the cranial sutures
* Encephalitis – swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections
* Hydrocephalus – a buildup of fluid inside the skull
* Meningitis – infection of the membranes covering the brain
* Shaken baby syndrome

===Sunken===
A sunken (also called &quot;depressed&quot;) fontanelle indicates dehydration or malnutrition.
===Enlarged===
The fontanelles may be enlarged, may be slow to close, or may never close, most commonly due to causes like: 
* Down syndrome
* Hydrocephalus
* Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
* Premature birth

Rarer causes include:
* Achondroplasia
* Apert syndrome
* Cleidocranial dysostosis
* Congenital rubella
* Neonatal hypothyroidism
* Osteogenesis imperfecta
* Rickets

===Third===
Sometimes there is a third bigger fontanelle other than posterior and anterior ones in a newborn. In one study, the frequency of third fontanelles in an unselected population of newborn infants was 6.3%. It is very common in Down syndrome and some congenital infections. If present, the physician should rule out serious conditions associated with the third fontanelle.

==Other animals==
===Primates===
In apes the fontanelles fuse soon after birth. In chimpanzees the anterior fontanelle is fully closed by 3 months of age.

===Dogs===
One of the more serious problems that can affect canines is known as an &quot;open fontanelle&quot;, which occurs when the skull bones at the top of the head fail to close. The problem is often found in conjunction with hydrocephalus, which is a condition in which too much fluid is found within and around the brain, placing pressure on the brain and surrounding tissues. Often the head will appear dome-shaped, and the open fontanelle is noticeable as a &quot;soft spot&quot; on the top of the dog&#x27;s head. The fluid-filled spaces within the brain, known as ventricles, also become swollen. The increased pressure damages or prevents the development of brain tissue.

Not all open fontanelles are connected with hydrocephalus. In many young dogs the skull bones are not fused at birth, but instead will close slowly over a three- to six-month period. Occasionally these bones fail to close, but the dog is still healthy. In these cases, however, the dog&#x27;s owners need to be very careful, since any injury or bumps to the animal&#x27;s head could cause significant brain damage, as well as conditions like epilepsy.

An open fontanelle, known as a molera, is a recognized feature of the Chihuahua breed. The American Kennel Club breed standard states that the skull of the Chihuahua should be domed, with or without the molera being present. However, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standard for the Chihuahua lists an open fontanelle as a disqualification.
