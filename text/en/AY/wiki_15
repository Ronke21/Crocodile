<text>Human papillomavirus infection (HPV infection) is caused by a DNA virus from the &quot;Papillomaviridae&quot; family. Many HPV infections cause no symptoms and 90% resolve spontaneously within two years. In some cases, an HPV infection persists and results in either warts or precancerous lesions. These lesions, depending on the site affected, increase the risk of cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, tonsils, or throat. Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV, and two strains – HPV16 and HPV18 – account for 70% of all cases. HPV16 is responsible for almost 90% of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. Between 60% and 90% of the other cancers listed above are also linked to HPV. HPV6 and HPV11 are common causes of genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis.
An HPV infection is caused by the &quot;human papillomavirus&quot;, a DNA virus from the papillomavirus family. Over 200 types have been described. An individual can become infected with more than one type of HPV, and the disease is only known to affect humans. More than 40 types may be spread through sexual contact and infect the anus and genitals. Risk factors for persistent infection by sexually transmitted types include early age of first sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners, smoking, and poor immune function. These types are typically spread by sustained direct skin-to-skin contact, with vaginal and anal sex being the most common methods. HPV infection can also spread from a mother to baby during pregnancy. There is no evidence that HPV can spread via common items like toilet seats, but the types that cause warts may spread via surfaces such as floors. HPV is not killed by common hand sanitizers and disinfectants, increasing the possibility of the virus being transferred via non-living infectious agents called fomites.
HPV vaccines can prevent the most common types of infection. To be most effective, inoculation should occur before the onset of sexual activity, and are therefore recommended between the ages of 9–13 years. Cervical cancer screening, such as the Papanicolaou test (&quot;pap smear&quot;), or examination of the cervix after applying acetic acid, can detect both early cancer and abnormal cells that may develop into cancer. Screening allows for early treatment which results in better outcomes. Screening has reduced both the number of cases and the number of deaths from cervical cancer. Genital warts can be removed by freezing.
Nearly every sexually active individual is infected by HPV at some point in their lives. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI), globally. High-risk HPVs cause about 5% of all cancers worldwide and about 37,300 cases of cancer in the United States each year. Cervical cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide, causing an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths in 2020. About 90% of these new cases and deaths of cervical cancer occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Roughly 1% of sexually active adults have genital warts. Cases of skin warts have been described since the time of ancient Greece, but it was not until 1907 that they were determined to be caused by a virus.
==HPV types==
HPV is a group of more than 200 related viruses, which are designated by a number for each virus type. Some HPV types, such as HPV5, may establish infections that persist for the lifetime of the individual without ever manifesting any clinical symptoms. HPV types 1 and 2 can cause common warts in some infected individuals. HPV types 6 and 11 can cause genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis.

Many HPV types are carcinogenic. About twelve HPV types (including types 16, 18, 31, and 45) are called &quot;high-risk&quot; types because persistent infection has been linked to cancer of the oropharynx, larynx, vulva, vagina, cervix, penis, and anus. These cancers all involve sexually transmitted infection of HPV to the stratified epithelial tissue. HPV type 16 is the strain most likely to cause cancer and is present in about 47% of all cervical cancers, and in many vaginal and vulvar cancers, penile cancers, anal cancers, and cancers of the head and neck.

The table below lists common symptoms of HPV infection and the associated types of HPV.

Available HPV vaccines protect against either two, four, or nine types of HPV. There are six prophylactic HPV vaccines licensed for use: the bivalent vaccines &quot;Cervarix&quot;, &quot;Cecolin&quot;, and &quot;Walrinvax&quot;; the quadrivalent vaccines &quot;Cervavax&quot; and &quot;Gardasil&quot;; and the nonavalent vaccine &quot;Gardasil 9&quot;. All HPV vaccines protect against at least HPV types 16 and 18, which cause the greatest risk of cervical cancer. The quadrivalent vaccines also protect against HPV types 6 and 11. The nonavalent vaccine Gardasil 9 provides protection against those four types (6, 11, 16, and 18), along with five other high-risk HPV types responsible for 20% of cervical cancers (types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58).

==Signs and symptoms==
===Warts===
Skin infection (&quot;cutaneous&quot; infection) with HPV is very widespread.
Skin infections with HPV can cause noncancerous skin growths called warts (verrucae). Warts are caused by the rapid growth of cells on the outer layer of the skin.
While cases of warts have been described since the time of ancient Greece, their viral cause was not known until 1907.

Skin warts are most common in childhood and typically appear and regress spontaneously over weeks to months. Recurring skin warts are common. All HPVs are believed to be capable of establishing long-term &quot;latent&quot; infections in small numbers of stem cells present in the skin. Although these latent infections may never be fully eradicated, immunological control is thought to block the appearance of symptoms such as warts. Immunological control is HPV type-specific, meaning an individual may become resistant to one HPV type while remaining susceptible to other types.

Types of warts include:
* Common warts are usually found on the hands and feet, but can also occur in other areas, such as the elbows or knees. Common warts have a characteristic cauliflower-like surface and are typically slightly raised above the surrounding skin. Cutaneous HPV types can cause genital warts but are not associated with the development of cancer.
* Plantar warts are found on the soles of the feet; they grow inward, generally causing pain when walking.
* Subungual or periungual warts form under the fingernail (subungual), around the fingernail, or on the cuticle (periungual). They are more difficult to treat than warts in other locations.
* Flat warts are most commonly found on the arms, face, or forehead. Like common warts, flat warts occur most frequently in children and teens. In people with normal immune function, flat warts are not associated with the development of cancer.
Common, flat, and plantar warts are much less likely to spread from person to person.

====Genital warts====
HPV infection of the skin in the genital area is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Such infections are associated with genital or anal warts (medically known as condylomata acuminata or venereal warts), and these warts are the most easily recognized sign of genital HPV infection.

The strains of HPV that can cause genital warts are usually different from those that cause warts on other parts of the body, such as the hands or feet, or even the inner thighs. A wide variety of HPV types can cause genital warts, but types 6 and 11 together account for about 90% of all cases. However, in total more than 40 types of HPV are transmitted through sexual contact and can infect the skin of the anus and genitals. Such infections may cause genital warts, although they may also remain asymptomatic.

The great majority of genital HPV infections never cause any overt symptoms and are cleared by the immune system in a matter of months. Moreover, people may transmit the virus to others even if they do not display overt symptoms of infection. Most people acquire genital HPV infections at some point in their lives, and about 10% of women are currently infected. A large increase in the incidence of genital HPV infection occurs at the age when individuals begin to engage in sexual activity. As with cutaneous HPVs, immunity to genital HPV is believed to be specific to a specific strain of HPV.

====Laryngeal papillomatosis====
In addition to genital warts, infection by HPV types 6 and 11 can cause a rare condition known as recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis, in which warts form on the larynx or other areas of the respiratory tract.
These warts can recur frequently, may interfere with breathing, and in extremely rare cases can progress to cancer. For these reasons, repeated surgery to remove the warts may be advisable.

===Cancer===
==== Case statistics ====
Cervical cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide, causing an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths in 2020. About 90% of these new cases and deaths of cervical cancer occurred in low- and middle-income countries, where screening tests and treatment of early cervical cell changes are not readily available.

In the United States, about 37,300 cases of cancer due to HPV occur each year.

==== Cancer development ====

In some infected individuals, their immune systems may fail to control HPV. Lingering infection with high-risk HPV types, such as types 16, 18, 31, and 45, can favor the development of cancer.
Co-factors such as cigarette smoke can also enhance the risk of HPV-related cancers.

HPV is believed to cause cancer by integrating its genome into nuclear DNA. Some of the early genes expressed by HPV, such as E6 and E7, act as oncogenes that promote tumor growth and malignant transformation. HPV genome integration can also cause carcinogenesis by promoting genomic instability associated with alterations in DNA copy number.

E6 produces a protein (also called E6) that simultaneously binds to two host cell proteins called p53 and E6-Associated Protein (E6-AP). E6AP is an E3 Ubiquitin ligase, an enzyme whose purpose is to tag proteins with a post-translational modification called Ubiquitin. By binding both proteins, E6 induces E6AP to attach a chain of ubiquitin molecules to p53, thereby flagging p53 for proteosomal degradation. Normally, p53 acts to prevent cell growth and promotes cell death in the presence of DNA damage. p53 also upregulates the p21 protein, which blocks the formation of the cyclin D/Cdk4 complex, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (RB), and in turn, halting cell cycle progression by preventing the activation of E2F. In short, p53 is a tumor-suppressor protein that arrests the cell cycle and prevents cell growth and survival when DNA damage occurs. Thus, the degradation of p53, induced by E6, promotes unregulated cell division, cell growth and cell survival, all characteristics of cancer.

It is important to note, that while the interaction between E6, E6AP, and p53 was the first to be characterized, there are multiple other proteins in the host cell which interact with E6 and assist in the induction of cancer.

==== Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin ====
Studies have also shown a link between a wide range of HPV types and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. In such cases, &quot;in vitro&quot; studies suggest that the E6 protein of the HPV virus may inhibit apoptosis induced by ultraviolet light.

==== Cervical cancer ====

Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are associated with HPV infection, with two types, HPV16 and HPV18, present in 70% of cases. In 2012, twelve HPV types were considered carcinogenic for cervical cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59. One study found that 74% of squamous cell carcinomas and 78% of adenocarcinomas tested positive for HPV types 16 or 18. Persistent HPV infection increases the risk for developing cervical carcinoma. Individuals who have an increased incidence of these types of infection are women with HIV/AIDS, who are at a 22-fold increased risk of cervical cancer.

The carcinogenic HPV types in cervical cancer belong to the alphapapillomavirus genus and can be grouped further into HPV clades. The two major carcinogenic HPV clades, alphapapillomavirus-9 (A9) and alphapapillomavirus-7 (A7), contain HPV16 and HPV18, respectively. These two HPV clades were shown to have different effects on tumour molecular characteristics and patient prognosis, with clade A7 being associated with more aggressive pathways and an inferior prognosis.

In 2020, about 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths from cervical cancer occurred worldwide. Around 90% of these occurred in the developing world.

Most HPV infections of the cervix are cleared rapidly by the immune system and do not progress to cervical cancer (see below the Clearance subsection in Virology). Because the process of transforming normal cervical cells into cancerous ones is slow, cancer occurs in people having been infected with HPV for a long time, usually over a decade or more (persistent infection). Furthermore, both the HPV infection and cervical cancer drive metabolic modifications that may be correlated with the aberrant regulation of enzymes related to metabolic pathways.

Non-European (NE) HPV16 variants are significantly more carcinogenic than European (E) HPV16 variants.

====Anal cancer====
The risk for anal cancer is 17 to 31 times higher among HIV-positive individuals who were coinfected with high-risk HPV, and 80 times higher for particularly HIV-positive men who have sex with men.

Anal Pap smear screening for anal cancer might benefit some subpopulations of men or women engaging in anal sex. No consensus exists, though, that such screening is beneficial, or who should get an anal Pap smear.

====Penile cancer====

HPV is associated with approximately 50% of penile cancers. In the United States, penile cancer accounts for about 0.5% of all cancer cases in men. HPV16 is the most commonly associated type detected. The risk of penile cancer increases 2- to 3-fold for individuals who are infected with HIV as well as HPV.

====Head and neck cancers====

Oral infection with high-risk carcinogenic HPV types (most commonly HPV 16) is associated with an increasing number of head and neck cancers. This association is independent of tobacco and alcohol use.

The local percentage varies widely, from 70% in the United States to 4% in Brazil. Engaging in anal or oral sex with an HPV-infected partner may increase the risk of developing these types of cancers.

In the United States, the number of newly diagnosed, HPV-associated head and neck cancers has surpassed that of cervical cancer cases. The rate of such cancers has increased from an estimated 0.8 cases per 100,000 people in 1988 to 4.5 per 100,000 in 2012, and, as of 2021, the rate has continued to increase. Researchers explain these recent data by an increase in oral sex. This type of cancer is more common in men than in women.

The mutational profile of HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck cancer has been reported, further demonstrating that they are fundamentally distinct diseases.

====Lung cancer====
Some evidence links HPV to benign and malignant tumors of the upper respiratory tract. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has found that people with lung cancer were significantly more likely to have several high-risk forms of HPV antibodies compared to those who did not have lung cancer. Researchers looking for HPV among 1,633 lung cancer patients and 2,729 people without the lung disease found that people with lung cancer had more types of HPV than noncancer patients did, and among lung cancer patients, the chances of having eight types of serious HPV were significantly increased. In addition, expression of HPV structural proteins by immunohistochemistry and &quot;in vitro&quot; studies suggest HPV presence in bronchial cancer and its precursor lesions. Another study detected HPV in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC), bronchial brushing and neoplastic lung tissue of cases, and found a presence of an HPV infection in 16.4% of the subjects affected by nonsmall cell lung cancer, but in none of the controls. The reported average frequencies of HPV in lung cancers were 17% and 15% in Europe and the Americas, respectively, and the mean number of HPV in Asian lung cancer samples was 35.7%, with considerable heterogeneity between certain countries and regions.

==== Skin cancer ====
In very rare cases, HPV may cause epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) in individuals with a weakened immune system. The virus, unchecked by the immune system, causes the overproduction of keratin by skin cells, resulting in lesions resembling warts or cutaneous horns which can ultimately transform into skin cancer, but the development is not well understood. The specific types of HPV that are associated with EV are HPV5, HPV8, and HPV14.

==Cause==
===Transmission===
Sexually transmitted HPV is divided into two categories: low-risk and high-risk. Low-risk HPVs cause warts on or around the genitals. Type 6 and 11 cause 90% of all genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis that causes benign tumors in the air passages. High-risk HPVs cause cancer and consist of about twelve identified types. Types 16 and 18 are responsible for causing most of HPV-caused cancers. These high-risk HPVs cause 5% of the cancers in the world. In the United States, high-risk HPVs cause 3% of all cancer cases in women and 2% in men.

Risk factors for persistent genital HPV infections, which increase the risk of developing cancer, include early age of first sexual intercourse, multiple partners, smoking, and immunosuppression. Genital HPV is spread by sustained direct skin-to-skin contact, with vaginal, anal, and oral sex being the most common methods. Occasionally, it can spread from manual sex or from a mother to her baby during pregnancy. HPV is difficult to remove via standard hospital disinfection techniques and may be transmitted in a healthcare setting on re-usable gynecological equipment, such as vaginal ultrasound transducers. The period of communicability is still unknown, but probably at least as long as visible HPV lesions persist. HPV may still be transmitted even after lesions are treated and no longer visible or present.

====Perinatal====
Although genital HPV types can be transmitted from mother to child during birth, the appearance of genital HPV-related diseases in newborns is rare. However, the lack of appearance does not rule out asymptomatic latent infection, as the virus has proven to be capable of hiding for decades. Perinatal transmission of HPV types 6 and 11 can result in the development of juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP). JORRP is very rare, with rates of about 2 cases per 100,000 children in the United States. Although JORRP rates are substantially higher if a woman presents with genital warts at the time of giving birth, the risk of JORRP in such cases is still less than 1%.

====Genital infections====

Genital HPV infections are transmitted primarily by contact with the genitals, anus, or mouth of an infected sexual partner.

Of the 120 known human papillomaviruses, 51 species and three subtypes infect the genital mucosa. Fifteen are classified as high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82), three as probable high-risk (26, 53, and 66), and twelve as low-risk (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and 89).

Condoms do not completely protect from the virus because the areas around the genitals including the inner thigh area are not covered, thus exposing these areas to the infected person&#x27;s skin.

====Hands====
Studies have shown HPV transmission between the hands and genitals of the same person and sexual partners. Hernandez tested the genitals and dominant hand of each person in 25 heterosexual couples every other month for an average of seven months. She found two couples where the man&#x27;s genitals infected the woman&#x27;s hand with high-risk HPV, two where her hand infected his genitals, one where her genitals infected his hand, two each where he infected his own hand, and she infected her own hand. Hands were not the main source of transmission in these 25 couples, but they were significant.

Partridge reports men&#x27;s fingertips became positive for high-risk HPV at more than half the rate (26% per two years) as their genitals (48%). Winer reports 14% of fingertip samples from sexually active women were positive.

Non-sexual hand contact seems to have little or no role in HPV transmission. Winer found all fourteen fingertip samples from virgin women negative at the start of her fingertip study. In a separate report on genital HPV infection, 1% of virgin women (1 of 76) with no sexual contact tested positive for HPV, while 10% of virgin women reporting non-penetrative sexual contact were positive (7 of 72).

====Shared objects====
Sharing of possibly contaminated objects, for example, razors, may transmit HPV. Although possible, transmission by routes other than sexual intercourse is less common for female genital HPV infection. Fingers-genital contact is a possible way of transmission but unlikely to be a significant source.

====Blood====
Though it has traditionally been assumed that HPV is not transmissible via blood – as it is thought to only infect cutaneous and mucosal tissues – recent studies have called this notion into question. Historically, HPV DNA has been detected in the blood of cervical cancer patients. In 2005, a group reported that, in frozen blood samples of 57 sexually naive pediatric patients who had vertical or transfusion-acquired HIV infection, 8 (14.0%) of these samples also tested positive for HPV-16. This seems to indicate that it may be possible for HPV to be transmitted via blood transfusion. However, as non-sexual transmission of HPV by other means is not uncommon, this could not be definitively proven. In 2009, a group tested Australian Red Cross blood samples from 180 healthy male donors for HPV, and subsequently found DNA of one or more strains of the virus in 15 (8.3%) of the samples. However, it is important to note that detecting the presence of HPV DNA in blood is not the same as detecting the virus itself in blood, and whether or not the virus itself can or does reside in blood in infected individuals is still unknown. As such, it remains to be determined whether HPV can or cannot be transmitted via blood. This is of concern, as blood donations are not currently screened for HPV, and at least some organizations such as the American Red Cross and other Red Cross societies do not presently appear to disallow HPV-positive individuals from donating blood.

====Surgery====
Hospital transmission of HPV, especially to surgical staff, has been documented. Surgeons, including urologists and/or anyone in the room, are subject to HPV infection by inhalation of noxious viral particles during electrocautery or laser ablation of a condyloma (wart). There has been a case report of a laser surgeon who developed extensive laryngeal papillomatosis after providing laser ablation to patients with anogenital condylomata.

===Virology===

HPV infection is limited to the basal cells of stratified epithelium, the only tissue in which they replicate. The virus cannot bind to live tissue; instead, it infects epithelial tissues through micro-abrasions or other epithelial trauma that exposes segments of the basement membrane. The infectious process is slow, taking 12–24 hours for initiation of transcription. It is believed that involved antibodies play a major neutralizing role while the virions still reside on the basement membrane and cell surfaces.

HPV lesions are thought to arise from the proliferation of infected basal keratinocytes. Infection typically occurs when basal cells in the host are exposed to the infectious virus through a disturbed epithelial barrier as would occur during sexual intercourse or after minor skin abrasions. HPV infections have not been shown to be cytolytic; rather, viral particles are released as a result of degeneration of desquamating cells. HPV can survive for many months and at low temperatures without a host; therefore, an individual with plantar warts can spread the virus by walking barefoot.

HPV is a small double-stranded circular DNA virus with a genome of approximately 8000 base pairs. The HPV life cycle strictly follows the differentiation program of the host keratinocyte. It is thought that the HPV virion infects epithelial tissues through micro-abrasions, whereby the virion associates with putative receptors such as alpha integrins, laminins, and annexin A2 leading to the entry of the virions into basal epithelial cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and/or caveolin-mediated endocytosis depending on the type of HPV. At this point, the viral genome is transported to the nucleus by unknown mechanisms and establishes itself at a copy number of 10-200 viral genomes per cell. A sophisticated transcriptional cascade then occurs as the host keratinocyte begins to divide and become increasingly differentiated in the upper layers of the epithelium.

==== Evolution ====
The phylogeny of the various strains of HPV generally reflects the migration patterns of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and suggests that HPV may have diversified along with the human population. Studies suggest that HPV evolved along five major branches that reflect the ethnicity of human hosts, and diversified along with the human population.

Researchers initially identified two major variants of HPV16, European (HPV16-E), and Non-European (HPV16-NE). More recent analyses based on thousands of HPV16 genomes show that indeed two major clades exist, that are further subdivided into four lineages (designated A-D) and even further subdivided into 16 sublineages (A1–4, B1–4, C1–4 and D1–4). The A1-A3 sublineages constitute the European variant, A4 the Asian variant, B1-B4 the African type I variant, C1–C4 the African type II variant, D1 the North American variant, D2 the Asian American type I variant, D3 the Asian American type II variant. The various lineages and sublineages have different oncogenic capacity, where overall, the non-European lineages are considered to increase the risk for cancer. Although HPV16 is a DNA virus, there are signs of recombination among the different lineages. Based on an analysis of more than 3600 genomes, between 0.3 and 1.2% of them could be recombinant. Thus, ideally, genotyping (for cancer-risk assessment) of HPV16 should not be based only on certain genes, but on all genes from the entire genome.

A bioinformatics tool named HPV16-Genotyper performs i) HPV16 lineage genotyping, ii) detects potential recombination events, iii) identifies, within the submitted sequences, mutations/SNPs that have been reported (in literature) to increase the risk for cancer.

====E6/E7 proteins====

The two primary oncoproteins of high-risk HPV types are E6 and E7. The &quot;E&quot; designation indicates that these two proteins are early proteins (expressed early in the HPV life cycle), while the &quot;L&quot; designation indicates that they are late proteins (late expression). The HPV genome is composed of six early (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) open reading frames (ORF), two late (L1 and L2) ORFs, and a non-coding long control region (LCR). After the host cell is infected viral early promoter is activated and a polycistronic primary RNA containing all six early ORFs is transcribed. This polycistronic RNA then undergoes active RNA splicing to generate multiple isoforms of mRNAs. One of the spliced isoform RNAs, E6*I, serves as an E7 mRNA to translate E7 protein. However, viral early transcription subjects to viral E2 regulation and high E2 levels repress the transcription. HPV genomes integrate into the host genome by disruption of E2 ORF, preventing E2 repression on E6 and E7. Thus, viral genome integration into the host DNA genome increases E6 and E7 expression to promote cellular proliferation and the chance of malignancy. The degree to which E6 and E7 are expressed is correlated with the type of cervical lesion that can ultimately develop.

;Role in cancer
Sometimes papillomavirus genomes are found integrated into the host genome, and this is especially noticeable with oncogenic HPVs. The E6/E7 proteins inactivate two tumor suppressor proteins, p53 (inactivated by E6) and pRb (inactivated by E7). The viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are thought to modify the cell cycle so as to retain the differentiating host keratinocyte in a state that is favourable to the amplification of viral genome replication and consequent late gene expression. E6 in association with host E6-associated protein, which has ubiquitin ligase activity, acts to ubiquitinate p53, leading to its proteosomal degradation. E7 (in oncogenic HPVs) acts as the primary transforming protein. E7 competes for retinoblastoma protein (pRb) binding, freeing the transcription factor E2F to transactivate its targets, thus pushing the cell cycle forward. All HPV can induce transient proliferation, but only strains 16 and 18 can immortalize cell lines &quot;in vitro&quot;. It has also been shown that HPV 16 and 18 cannot immortalize primary rat cells alone; there needs to be activation of the ras oncogene. In the upper layers of the host epithelium, the late genes L1 and L2 are transcribed/translated and serve as structural proteins that encapsidate the amplified viral genomes. Once the genome is encapsidated, the capsid appears to undergo a redox-dependent assembly/maturation event, which is tied to a natural redox gradient that spans both suprabasal and cornified epithelial tissue layers. This assembly/maturation event stabilizes virions and increases their specific infectivity. Virions can then be sloughed off in the dead squames of the host epithelium and the viral lifecycle continues. A 2010 study has found that E6 and E7 are involved in beta-catenin nuclear accumulation and activation of Wnt signaling in HPV-induced cancers.

====Latency period====
Once an HPV virion invades a cell, an active infection occurs, and the virus can be transmitted. Several months to years may elapse before squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) develop and can be clinically detected. The time from active infection to clinically detectable disease may make it difficult for epidemiologists to establish which partner was the source of infection.

====Clearance====
Most HPV infections are cleared up by most people without medical action or consequences. The table provides data for high-risk types (i.e. the types found in cancers).

Clearing an infection does not always create immunity if there is a new or continuing source of infection. Hernandez&#x27; 2005-6 study of 25 couples reports &quot;A number of instances indicated apparent reinfection [from partner] after viral clearance.&quot;

==Diagnosis==

Over 200 types of HPV have been identified, and they are designated by numbers. They may be divided into &quot;low-risk&quot; and &quot;high-risk&quot; types. Low-risk types cause warts and high-risk types can cause lesions or cancer.

===Cervical testing===

Guidelines from the American Cancer Society recommend different screening strategies for cervical cancer based on a woman&#x27;s age, screening history, risk factors, and choice of tests. Because of the link between HPV and cervical cancer, the ACS currently recommends early detection of cervical cancer in average-risk asymptomatic adults primarily with cervical cytology by Pap smear, regardless of HPV vaccination status. Women aged 30–65 should preferably be tested every 5 years with both the HPV test and the Pap test. In other age groups, a Pap test alone can suffice unless they have been diagnosed with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). Co-testing with a Pap test and HPV test is recommended because it decreases the rate of false-negatives. According to the National Cancer Institute, &quot;The most common test detects DNA from several high-risk HPV types, but it cannot identify the types that are present. Another test is specific for DNA from HPV types 16 and 18, the two types that cause most HPV-associated cancers. A third test can detect DNA from several high-risk HPV types and can indicate whether HPV-16 or HPV-18 is present. A fourth test detects RNA from the most common high-risk HPV types. These tests can detect HPV infections before cell abnormalities are evident.

&quot;Theoretically, the HPV DNA and RNA tests could be used to identify HPV infections in cells taken from any part of the body. However, the tests are approved by the FDA for only two indications: for follow-up testing of women who seem to have abnormal Pap test results and for cervical cancer screening in combination with a Pap test among women over age 30.&quot;

===Mouth testing===
Guidelines for oropharyngeal cancer screening by the Preventive Services Task Force and American Dental Association in the U.S. suggest conventional visual examination, but because some parts of the oropharynx are hard to see, this cancer is often only detected in later stages.

The diagnosis of oropharyngeal cancer occurs by biopsy of exfoliated cells or tissues. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and College of American Pathologists recommend testing for HPV in oropharyngeal cancer. However, while testing is recommended, there is no specific type of test used to detect HPV from oral tumors that is currently recommended by the FDA in the United States. Because HPV type 16 is the most common type found in oropharyngeal cancer, p16 immunohistochemistry is one test option used to determine if HPV is present, which can help determine course of treatment since tumors that are negative for p16 have better outcomes. Another option that has emerged as a reliable option is HPV DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) which allows for visualization of the HPV.

===Testing men===
There is not a wide range of tests available even though HPV is common; most studies of HPV used tools and custom analysis not available to the general public. Clinicians often depend on the vaccine among young people and high clearance rates (see Clearance subsection in Virology) to create a low risk of disease and mortality, and treat the cancers when they appear. Others believe that reducing HPV infection in more men and women, even when it has no symptoms, is important (herd immunity) to prevent more cancers rather than just treating them. Where tests are used, negative test results show safety from transmission, and positive test results show where shielding (condoms, gloves) is needed to prevent transmission until the infection clears.

Studies have tested for and found HPV in men, including high-risk types (i.e. the types found in cancers), on fingers, mouth, saliva, anus, urethra, urine, semen, blood, scrotum and penis.

The aforementioned Qiagen/Digene kit was successfully used off-label to test the penis, scrotum, and anus of men in long-term relationships with women who were positive for high-risk HPV. Of these men, 60% were found to carry the virus, primarily on the penis. Similar studies have been conducted on women using cytobrushes - an endocervical brush for sampling the cervix in females - and custom analysis.

In one study researchers sampled subjects&#x27; urethra, scrotum, and penis. Samples taken from the urethra added less than 1% to the HPV rate. Studies like this led Giuliano to recommend sampling the glans, shaft, and crease between them, along with the scrotum, since sampling the urethra or anus added very little to the diagnosis. Dunne recommends the glans, shaft, their crease, and the foreskin.

In one study the subjects were asked not to wash their genitals for 12 hours before sampling, including the urethra as well as the scrotum and the penis. Other studies are silent on washing – a particular gap in studies of the hands.

One small study used wet cytobrushes, rather than wet the skin. It found a higher proportion of men to be HPV-positive when the skin was rubbed with a 600 grit emery paper before being swabbed with the brush, rather than swabbed with no preparation. It&#x27;s unclear whether the emery paper collected the virions or simply loosened them for the swab to collect.

Studies have found self-collection (with emery paper and Dacron swabs) as effective as collection done by a clinician, and sometimes more so, since patients were more willing than a clinician to scrape vigorously. Women had similar success in self-sampling using tampons, swabs, cytobrushes, and lavage.

Several studies used cytobrushes to sample fingertips and under fingernails, without wetting the area or the brush.

Other studies analyzed urine, semen, and blood and found varying amounts of HPV, but there is not a publicly available test for those yet.

===Other testing===
Although it is possible to test for HPV DNA in other kinds of infections, there are no FDA-approved tests for general screening in the United States or tests approved by the Canadian government, since the testing is inconclusive and considered medically unnecessary.

Genital warts are the only visible sign of low-risk genital HPV and can be identified with a visual check. These visible growths, however, are the result of non-carcinogenic HPV types. Five percent acetic acid (vinegar) is used to identify both warts and squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (SIL) lesions with limited success by causing abnormal tissue to appear white, but most doctors have found this technique helpful only in moist areas, such as the female genital tract. At this time, HPV tests for males are used only in research.

Research into testing for HPV by antibody presence has been done. The approach is looking for an immune response in blood, which would contain antibodies for HPV if the patient is HPV positive. The reliability of such tests has not been proven, as there has not been a FDA approved product as of August 2018; testing by blood would be a less invasive test for screening purposes.

==Prevention==

The HPV vaccines can prevent the most common types of infection. To be effective they must be used before an infection occurs and are therefore recommended between the ages of nine and thirteen. Cervical cancer screening, such as with the Papanicolaou test (pap) or looking at the cervix after using acetic acid, can detect early cancer or abnormal cells that may develop into cancer. This allows for early treatment which results in better outcomes. Screening has reduced both the number and deaths from cervical cancer in the developed world. Warts can be removed by freezing.

===Vaccines===
Three vaccines are available to prevent infection by some HPV types: Gardasil, Gardasil 9 and Cervarix; all three protect against initial infection with HPV types 16 and 18, which cause most of the HPV-associated cancer cases. Gardasil also protects against HPV types 6 and 11, which cause 90% of genital warts. Gardasil is a recombinant quadrivalent vaccine, whereas Cervarix is bivalent, and is prepared from virus-like particles (VLP) of the L1 capsid protein. Gardasil 9 is nonavalent, having the potential to prevent about 90% of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers. It can protect for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; the latter five cause up to 20% of cervical cancers which were not previously covered.

The vaccines provide little benefit to women already infected with HPV types 16 and 18. For this reason, the vaccine is recommended primarily for those women not yet having been exposed to HPV during sex. The World Health Organization position paper on HPV vaccination clearly outlines appropriate, cost-effective strategies for using HPV vaccine in public sector programs.

There is high-certainty evidence that HPV vaccines protect against precancerous cervical lesions in young women, particularly those vaccinated aged 15 to 26. HPV vaccines do not increase the risk of serious adverse events. Longer follow-up is needed to monitor the impact of HPV vaccines on cervical cancer.

The CDC recommends the vaccines be delivered in two shots at an interval of at least 6 months for those aged 11–12, and three doses for those 13 and older. In most countries, they are funded only for female use, but are approved for male use in many countries, and funded for teenage boys in Australia. The vaccine does not have any therapeutic effect on existing HPV infections or cervical lesions. In 2010, 49% of teenage girls in the US got the HPV vaccine.

Following studies suggesting that the vaccine is more effective in younger girls than in older teenagers, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Quebec began offering the vaccine in a two-dose schedule for girls aged under 15 in 2014.

Cervical cancer screening recommendations have not changed for females who receive the HPV vaccine. It remains a recommendation that women continue cervical screening, such as Pap smear testing, even after receiving the vaccine, since it does not prevent all types of cervical cancer.

Both men and women are carriers of HPV. The Gardasil vaccine also protects men against anal cancers and warts and genital warts.

Duration of both vaccines&#x27; efficacy has been observed since they were first developed, and is expected to be long-lasting.

In December 2014, the FDA approved a nine-valent Gardasil-based vaccine, Gardasil 9, to protect against infection with the four strains of HPV covered by the first generation of Gardasil as well as five other strains responsible for 20% of cervical cancers (HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-45, HPV-52, and HPV-58).

===Condoms===
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that male &quot;condom use may reduce the risk for genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection&quot; but provides a lesser degree of protection compared with other sexual transmitted infections &quot;because HPV also may be transmitted by exposure to areas (e.g., infected skin or mucosal surfaces) that are not covered or protected by the condom.&quot;

=== Disinfection ===
The virus is unusually hardy and is immune to most common disinfectants. It is the first virus ever shown to be resistant to inactivation by glutaraldehyde, which is among the most common strong disinfectants used in hospitals. Diluted sodium hypochlorite bleach is effective, but cannot be used on some types of re-usable equipment, such as ultrasound transducers. As a result of these difficulties, there is developing concern about the possibility of transmitting the virus on healthcare equipment, particularly reusable gynecological equipment that cannot be autoclaved. For such equipment, some health authorities encourage use of UV disinfection or a non-hypochlorite &quot;oxidizing‐based high‐level disinfectant [bleach] with label claims for non‐enveloped viruses&quot;, such as a strong hydrogen peroxide solution or chlorine dioxide wipes. Such disinfection methods are expected to be relatively effective against HPV.

==Management==

There is currently no specific treatment for HPV infection. However, the viral infection is usually cleared to undetectable levels by the immune system. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the body&#x27;s immune system clears HPV naturally within two years for 90% of cases (see Clearance subsection in Virology for more detail). However, experts do not agree on whether the virus is eliminated or reduced to undetectable levels, and it is difficult to know when it is contagious.

Follow up care is usually recommended and practiced by many health clinics. Follow-up is sometimes not successful because a portion of those treated do not return to be evaluated. In addition to the normal methods of phone calls and mail, text messaging and email can improve the number of people who return for care. As of 2015 it is unclear the best method of follow up following treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, 12% of women are positive for HPV DNA, with rates varying by age and country. The highest rates of HPV are in younger women, with a rate of 24% in women under 25 years. Rates decline in older age groups in Europe and the Americas, but less so in Africa and Asia. The rates are highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (24%) and Eastern Europe (21%) and lowest in North America (5%) and Western Asia (2%).

The most common types of HPV worldwide are HPV16 (3.2%), HPV18 (1.4%), HPV52 (0.9%), HPV31 (0.8%), and HPV58 (0.7%). High-risk types of HPV are also distributed unevenly, with HPV16 having a rate of around 13% in Africa and 30% in West and Central Asia.

Like many diseases, HPV disproportionately affects low-income and resource-poor countries. The higher rates of HPV in Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, may be related to high exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the region. Other factors that impact the global spread of disease are sexual behaviors including age of sexual debut, number of sexual partners, and ease of access to barrier contraception, all of which vary globally.

===United States===

HPV is estimated to be the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. Most sexually active men and women will probably acquire genital HPV infection at some point in their lives. The American Social Health Association estimates that about 75–80% of sexually active Americans will be infected with HPV at some point in their lifetime. By the age of 50 more than 80% of American women will have contracted at least one strain of genital HPV. It was estimated that, in the year 2000, there were approximately 6.2 million new HPV infections among Americans aged 15–44; of these, an estimated 74% occurred to people between ages of 15 and 24. Of the STIs studied, genital HPV was the most commonly acquired. In the United States, it is estimated that 10% of the population has an active HPV infection, 4% has an infection that has caused cytological abnormalities, and an additional 1% has an infection causing genital warts.

Estimates of HPV prevalence vary from 14% to more than 90%. One reason for the difference is that some studies report women who currently have a detectable infection, while other studies report women who have ever had a detectable infection. Another cause of discrepancy is the difference in strains that were tested for.

One study found that, during 2003–2004, at any given time, 26.8% of women aged 14 to 59 were infected with at least one type of HPV. This was higher than previous estimates; 15.2% were infected with one or more of the high-risk types that can cause cancer.

The prevalence for high-risk and low-risk types is roughly similar over time.

Human papillomavirus is not included among the diseases that are typically reportable to the CDC as of 2011.

=== Ireland ===
On average 538 cases of HPV-associated cancers were diagnosed per year in Ireland during the period 2010 to 2014. Cervical cancer was the most frequent HPV-associated cancer with on average 292 cases per year (74% of the female total, and 54% of the overall total of HPV-associated cancers). A study of 996 cervical cytology samples in an Irish urban female, opportunistically screened population, found an overall HPV prevalence of 19.8%, HPV 16 at 20% and HPV 18 at 12% were the commonest high-risk types detected. In Europe, types 16 and 18 are responsible for over 70% of cervical cancers. Overall rates of HPV-associated invasive cancers may be increasing. Between 1994 and 2014, there was a 2% increase in the rate of HPV-associated invasive cancers per year for both sexes in Ireland.

As HPV is known to be associated with anogenital warts, these are notifiable to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). Genital warts are the second most common STI in Ireland. There were 1,281 cases of anogenital warts notified in 2017, which was a decrease on the 2016 figure of 1,593. The highest age-specific rate for both male and female was in the 25–29 year old age range; 53% of cases were among males.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka, the prevalence of HPV is 15.5% regardless of cytological abnormalities.

===Inner Mongolia===
In the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia overall HPV prevalence is 14.5% but shows substantial ethnical disparity, the prevalence in Mongolian women (14.9%) being much higher than that of Han participants (4.3%). Urbanization, the number of sex partners, and PAP history appear as risk factors for HPV infection in Han, but not in Mongolian women. The region is thus an important example that the epidemiology of HPV is more related to cultural and ethnical factors and not to geography per se.

==History==
In 1972, the association of the human papillomaviruses with skin cancer in epidermodysplasia verruciformis was proposed by Stefania Jabłońska in Poland. In 1976 Harald zur Hausen published the hypothesis that human papillomavirus plays an important role in the cause of cervical cancer. In 1978, Jabłońska and Gerard Orth at the Pasteur Institute discovered HPV-5 in skin cancer. In 1983 and 1984 zur Hausen and his collaborators identified HPV16 and HPV18 in cervical cancer.

The HeLa cell line contains extra DNA in its genome that originated from HPV type 18.

==Research==
The Ludwig-McGill HPV Cohort is one of the world&#x27;s largest longitudinal studies of the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer risk. It was established in 1993 by Ludwig Cancer Research and McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

<text>Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS), also known as Todd&#x27;s Syndrome or Dysmetropsia, is a neurological disorder that distorts perception. People with this syndrome may experience distortions in their visual perception of objects, such as appearing smaller (micropsia) or larger (macropsia), or appearing to be closer (pelopsia) or farther (teleopsia) than they are. Distortion may also occur for senses other than vision.
The cause of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is currently not known, but it has often been associated with migraines, head trauma, or viral encephalitis caused by Epstein–Barr Virus Infection. It is also theorized that AIWS can be caused by abnormal amounts of electrical activity, resulting in abnormal blood flow in the parts of the brain that process visual perception and texture.

Although there are cases of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome in both adolescents and adults, it is most commonly seen in children.

== Classification ==
The classification is not universally agreed upon in literature, however, some authors distinguish true Alice in Wonderland syndrome based solely on symptoms related to alterations in a person&#x27;s body image. In contrast, they utilize the term &quot;Alice in Wonderland-like syndrome&quot; to encompass symptoms associated with changes in perception of vision, time, hearing, touch, or other external perceptions.

Due to the classification of all the clinical features seen in Alice in Wonderland, the table below illustrates theses features and symptoms by type with Type C having a combination of Type A and Type B symptoms.
==Signs and symptoms==
With over 60 associated symptoms, AIWS affects the sense of vision, sensation, touch, and hearing, as well as the perception of one&#x27;s body image. Migraines, nausea, dizziness, and agitation are also commonly associated symptoms with Alice in Wonderland syndrome. Less frequent symptoms also include: loss of limb control and coordination, memory loss, lingering touch and sound sensations, and emotional instability. Alice in Wonderland syndrome is often associated with distortion of sensory perception, which involves visual, somatosensory, and non-visual symptoms. AIWS is characterized by the individual being able to recognize the distortion in the perception of their own body and is episodic. AIWS episodes vary in length from person to person. Episodes typically last from a few minutes to an hour, and each episode may vary in experience.

=== Visual distortions ===
Individuals with AIWS can experience illusions of expansion, reduction, or distortion of their body image, such as &quot;microsomatognosia&quot; (feeling that their own body or body parts are shrinking), or &quot;macrosomatognosia&quot; (feeling that their body or body parts are growing taller or larger). These changes in perception are collectively known as metamorphopsias, or Lilliputian hallucinations, which refer to objects appearing either smaller or larger than reality. People with certain neurological diseases may also experience similar visual hallucinations.

Within the category of Lilliputian hallucinations, people may experience either micropsia or macropsia. Micropsia is an abnormal visual condition, usually occurring in the context of visual hallucination, in which the affected person sees objects as being smaller than they are in reality. Macropsia is a condition where the individual sees everything larger than it is. These visual distortions are sometimes classified as &quot;Alice in Wonderland-like syndrome&quot; instead of true Alice in Wonderland syndrome but are often still classified as Alice in Wonderland syndrome by health professionals and researchers since the distinction is not official. Other distortions include teleopsia (objects are perceived further than they actually are) and pelopsia (objects are perceived closer than they actually are).

=== Depersonalization and derealization ===
Along with size, mass, and shape distortions of the body, those with Alice in Wonderland syndrome often experience a feeling of disconnection from one&#x27;s own body, feelings, thoughts, and environment known as depersonalization-derealization disorder. Depersonalization is a term specifically used to express a true detachment from their personal self and identity. It is described as being an observer completely outside of their own actions and behaviors. Derealization is seen as &quot;dreamlike, empty, lifeless, or visually distorted.&quot; Drug and alcohol use can exacerbate this symptom into psychosis.

=== Hearing and time distortions ===
Individuals experiencing Alice in Wonderland syndrome can also often experience paranoia as a result of disturbances in sound perception. These disturbances can include the amplification of soft sounds or the misinterpretation of common sounds. Other auditory changes include distortion in pitch and tone and hearing indistinguishable and strange voices, noises, or music.

A person affected by AIWS may also lose a sense of time, a problem similar to the lack of spatial perspective brought on by visual distortion. This condition is known as tachysensia. For those with tachysensia, time may seem to pass very slowly, similar to an LSD experience, and the lack of time and space perspective can also lead to a distorted sense of velocity. For example, an object could be moving extremely slowly in reality, but to a person experiencing time distortions, it could seem that the object was sprinting uncontrollably along a moving walkway, leading to severe, overwhelming disorientation. Having symptoms of tachysensia is correlated with various underlying conditions, including substance use, migraine, epilepsy, head trauma, and encephalitis. Regardless of an individual&#x27;s disease diagnosis, tachysensia is often included as a symptom associated with Alice in Wonderland Syndrome since it is classified as a perceptual distortion. Therefore, a person can be described as having Alice in Wonderland syndrome even if that person is experiencing tachysensia due to an underlying condition.

== Causes ==
Because AlWS is not commonly diagnosed and documented, it is difficult to estimate what the main causes are. The cause of over half of the documented cases of Alice in Wonderland syndrome is unknown. Complete and partial forms of the AIWS exist in a range of other disorders, including epilepsy, intoxicants, infectious states, fevers, and brain lesions. Furthermore, the syndrome is commonly associated with migraines, as well as excessive screen use in dark spaces and the use of psychoactive drugs. It can also be the initial symptom of the Epstein–Barr virus (see mononucleosis), and a relationship between the syndrome and mononucleosis has been suggested. Within this suggested relationship, Epstein–Barr virus appears to be the most common cause in children, while for adults it is more commonly associated with migraines.

=== Infectious diseases ===
A 2021 review found that infectious diseases are the most common cause of Alice in Wonderland syndrome, especially in pediatrics. Some of these infectious agents included Epstein–Barr virus, Varicella Zoster virus, Influenza, Zika, Coxsackievirus, &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; protozoa, and &quot;Mycoplasma pneumonia/Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; bacteria. The association of Alice in Wonderland syndrome is most commonly seen with the Epstein–Barr virus. However, pathogenesis is not well understood beyond these reviews. In some instances, Alice in Wonderland syndrome was reported to be associated with an Influenza A infection.

=== Cerebral hypotheses ===
Alice in Wonderland syndrome can be caused by abnormal amounts of electrical activity resulting in abnormal blood flow in the parts of the brain that process visual perception and texture. Nuclear medical techniques using technetium, performed on individuals during episodes of Alice in Wonderland syndrome, have demonstrated that Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is associated with reduced cerebral perfusion in various cortical regions (frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital), both in combination and in isolation. One hypothesis is that any condition resulting in a decrease in perfusion of the visual pathways or visual control centers of the brain may be responsible for the syndrome. For example, one study used single photon emission computed tomography to demonstrate reduced cerebral perfusion in the temporal lobe in people with Alice in Wonderland syndrome.

Other theories suggest the syndrome is a result of non-specific cortical dysfunction (e.g. from encephalitis, epilepsy, decreased cerebral blood flow), or reduced blood flow to other areas of the brain. Other theories suggest that distorted body image perceptions stem from within the parietal lobe. This has been demonstrated by the production of body image disturbances through electrical stimulation of the posterior parietal cortex. Other researchers suggest that metamorphopsias, or visual distortions, may be a result of reduced perfusion of the non-dominant posterior parietal lobe during migraine episodes.

Throughout all the neuroimaging studies, several cortical regions (including the temporoparietal junction within the parietal lobe, and the visual pathway, specifically the occipital lobe) are associated with the development of Alice in Wonderland syndrome symptoms.[1]

=== Migraines ===
1 in 10 people who experience migraines have symptoms of Alice in Wonderland syndrome. The role of migraines in Alice in Wonderland syndrome is still not understood, but both vascular and electrical theories have been suggested. For example, visual distortions may be a result of transient, localized ischemia in areas of the visual pathway during migraine attacks. In addition, a spreading wave of depolarization of cells (particularly glial cells) in the cerebral cortex during migraine attacks can eventually activate the trigeminal nerve&#x27;s regulation of the vascular system. The intense cranial pain during migraines is due to the connection of the trigeminal nerve with the thalamus and thalamic projections onto the sensory cortex. Alice in Wonderland syndrome symptoms can precede, accompany, or replace the typical migraine symptoms. Typical migraines (aura, visual derangements, hemicrania headache, nausea, and vomiting) are both a cause and an associated symptom of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is associated with macrosomatognosia which can mostly be experienced during migraine auras.

=== Genetic and environmental influence ===
While there currently is no identified genetic locus/loci associated with Alice in Wonderland syndrome, observations suggest that a genetic component may exist but the evidence so far is inconclusive. There is also an established genetic component for migraines which may be considered to be a possible cause and influence for hereditary Alice in Wonderland syndrome. Though most frequently described in children and adolescents, observational studies have found that many parents of children experiencing Alice in Wonderland syndrome have also experienced similar symptoms themselves, though often unrecognized. Family history may then be a potential risk factor for Alice in Wonderland syndrome.

One example of environmental influences on the incidence of Alice in Wonderland syndrome includes the drug use and toxicity of topiramate. Other reports of tyramine usage and the association with Alice in Wonderland syndrome has been reported but current evidence is inconclusive. Further research is required to establish the genetic and environmental influences on Alice in Wonderland syndrome.

The neuronal effect of cortical spreading depression (CSD) on TPO-C may demonstrate the link between migraines and Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. As children experience Alice in Wonderland Syndrome more than adults, it is hypothesized that structural differences in the brain between children and adults may play a role in the development of this syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
Alice in Wonderland syndrome is not part of any major classifications like the ICD-10 and the DSM-5. Since there are no established diagnostic criteria for Alice in Wonderland syndrome, and because Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a disturbance of perception rather than a specific physiological condition, there is likely to be a large degree of variability in the diagnostic process and thus it can be poorly diagnosed.

Often, the diagnosis can be presumed when other causes have been ruled out. Additionally, Alice in Wonderland syndrome can be presumed if the patient presents symptoms along with migraines and complains of onset during the day (although it can also occur at night). Ideally, a definite diagnosis requires a thorough physical examination, proper history taking from episodes and occurrences, and a concrete understanding of the signs and symptoms of Alice in Wonderland syndrome for differential diagnosis. A person experiencing Alice in Wonderland syndrome may be reluctant to describe their symptoms out of fear of being labeled with a psychiatric disorder, which can contribute to the difficulty in diagnosing Alice in Wonderland syndrome. In addition, younger individuals may struggle to describe their unusual symptoms, and thus, one recommended approach is to encourage children to draw their visual illusions during episodes. 

Cases that are suspected should warrant tests and exams such as blood tests, ECG, brain MRI, and other antibody tests for viral antibody detection. Differential diagnosis requires three levels of conceptualization. Symptoms need to be distinguished from other disorders that involve hallucinations and illusions. It is usually easy to rule out psychosis as those with Alice in Wonderland syndrome are typically aware that their hallucinations and distorted perceptions are not &#x27;real&#x27;. Once these symptoms are distinguished and identified, the most likely cause needs to be established. Finally, the diagnosed condition needs to be evaluated to see if the condition is responsible for the symptoms that the individual is presenting. Given the wide variety of metamorphopsias and other distortions, it is not uncommon for Alice in Wonderland syndrome to be misdiagnosed or confused with other etiologies.

==Anatomical relation==
An area of the brain that is important to the development of Alice in Wonderland syndrome is the temporal-parietal-occipital carrefour (TPO-C), where TPO-C region is the meeting point of temporooccipital, parietooccipital, and temporoparietal junctions in the brain. The TPO-C region is also crucial as it is the location where somatosensory and visual information are interpreted by the brain to generate any internal or external manifestations. Thus, modifications to these regions of the brain may trigger the cause of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome and body schema disorders simultaneously .

Depending on which portion of the brain is damaged, the symptoms of Alice in Wonderland syndrome may differ. For example, it has been reported that injury to the anterior portion of the brain is more likely to be correlated to more complex and a wider range of symptoms, whereas damage to the occipital region has mainly been associated with only simple visual disturbances.

==Prognosis==
The symptoms of Alice in Wonderland syndrome themselves are not physically harmful for the experiencer. Since there is no established treatment for Alice in Wonderland syndrome, prognosis varies between patients and is based on whether an underlying cause has been identified. In many cases, the intensity of the episodes and symptoms decline. Since it is predominately a benign condition, treatment isn&#x27;t always required. Limitations of the prognosis of Alice in Wonderland syndrome are due to the disorder&#x27;s low prevalence. Because of this, symptoms require careful evaluation and observation by healthcare professionals.

Some cases include reoccurring symptoms in which other medical conditions have to be ruled out before diagnosing AIWS If Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is caused by underlying conditions, symptoms typically occur during the underlying disease and can last from few days to months. In most cases, symptoms may disappear either spontaneously, with the treatment of underlying causes, or after reassurances that symptoms are momentary and harmless. In some cases, individuals experience only a few episodes of symptoms. In other cases, symptoms may repeat over several episodes before resolution. In rare cases, symptoms continue to manifest years after the initial experience, sometimes with the development of new visual disorders or migraines. In these cases, medication can be introduced to counteract some of these distortions and manifestations. However, medications may also have inducing effects.

==Treatment==
At present (2024), Alice in Wonderland Syndrome has no standardized treatment plan. Tests including electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to view brain activity to examine possible brain injury or deficits. Since symptoms of Alice in Wonderland syndrome often disappear, either spontaneously on their own, or with the treatment of the underlying disease, most clinical and non-clinical Alice in Wonderland Syndrome cases are considered to be benign. In cases of Alice in Wonderland syndrome caused by underlying chronic disease, however, symptoms tend to reappear during the active phase of the underlying cause (e.g., migraine, epilepsy). If treatment of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is determined necessary and useful, it should be focused on treating the suspected underlying disease. Treatment of these underlying conditions mostly involves prescription medications such as antiepileptics, migraine prophylaxis, antivirals, or antibiotics. Antipsychotics are rarely used in treating Alice in Wonderland Syndrome symptoms due to their minimal effectiveness. There are also rare cases in which these prescription medications ,specifically antipsychotics, may worsen psychosis and psychotic symptoms due to the severity of distortions.

In 2011, a patient was examined for having verbal auditory hallucinations (VAHs) and functional MRI (fMRI) was employed to localize cerebral activity during self-reported VAHs. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTSMS) was used on the patient&#x27;s Brodmann&#x27;s area 40, in charge of meaning and phonology, at a frequency of 1 Hz at T3P3. After the second week of treatment, all VAHs and sensory distortions have no effected on the patient and went through a full remission. Follow up appointments were conducted with no signs of any symptoms. By month 8, the symptoms returned. A second treatment was done with complete remission.

=== Migraine prophylaxis ===
Treatment methods revolving around migraine prophylaxis include medications and following a low-tyramine diet. Drugs that may be used to prevent migraines include anticonvulsants, antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers. Other treatments that have been explored for migraines include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). However, further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of this treatment regime.

==Epidemiology==
The lack of established diagnostic criteria or large-scale epidemiological studies, low awareness of the syndrome, and the unstandardized diagnosis criteria and definition for Alice in Wonderland syndrome mean that the exact prevalence of the syndrome is currently unknown. One study on 3,224 adolescents in Japan demonstrated the occurrence of macropsia and micropsia to be 6.5% in boys and 7.3% in girls, suggesting that the symptoms of Alice in Wonderland syndrome may not be particularly rare. This also seems to suggest a difference in the male-to-female ratio of people with Alice in Wonderland syndrome. However, according to other studies, it appears that the male/female ratio is dependent on the age range being observed. Studies showed that younger males (age range of 5 to 14 years) were 2.69 times more likely to experience Alice in Wonderland syndrome than girls of the same age, while there were no significant differences between students of 13 to 15 years of age. Conversely, female students (16- to 18-year-olds) showed a significantly greater prevalence.

Alice in Wonderland syndrome is more frequently seen in children and young adults. The average age of the start of Alice in Wonderland syndrome is six years old, but it is typical for some people to experience the syndrome from childhood up to their late twenties. Because many parents who have Alice in Wonderland syndrome report their children having it as well, the condition is thought possibly to be hereditary. Some parents report not realizing they have experienced Alice in Wonderland syndrome symptoms until after their children have been diagnosed, further indicating that many cases of Alice in Wonderland syndrome likely go unrecognized and under-reported.

Research is still being expanded upon and developed on this syndrome in a multitude of different regions and specialties. Future studies are encouraged to include global collaborative efforts that may help improve understanding of Alice in Wonderland syndrome and its epidemiology.

==History==
The syndrome is sometimes called Todd&#x27;s syndrome, about a description of the condition in 1955 by Dr. John Todd (1914–1987), a British consultant psychiatrist at High Royds Hospital at Menston in West Yorkshire (&#x27;AIWS had been described by American Neurologist Caro Lippman in 1952, but Todd&#x27;s report was the most influential&#x27;). Todd discovered that several of his patients experienced severe headaches causing them to see and perceive objects as greatly out of proportion. In addition, they had altered sense of time and touch, as well as distorted perceptions of their own body. Despite having migraine headaches, none of these patients had brain tumors, damaged eyesight, or mental illness that could have accounted for these and similar symptoms. They were all able to think lucidly and could distinguish hallucinations from reality, however, their perceptions were distorted.

Dr. Todd speculated that author Lewis Carroll had used his own migraine experiences as a source of inspiration for his famous 1865 novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Carroll&#x27;s diary reveals that, in 1856, he consulted William Bowman, an ophthalmologist, about the visual manifestations of the migraines he regularly experienced. In Carroll&#x27;s diaries, he often wrote of a &quot;bilious headache&quot; that came coupled with severe nausea and vomiting. In 1885, he wrote that he had &quot;experienced, for the second time, that odd optical affection of seeing moving fortifications, followed by a headache&quot;. Carroll wrote two books about Alice, the heroine after which the syndrome is named. In the story, Alice experiences several strange feelings that overlap with the characteristics of the syndrome, such as slowing time perception. In chapter two of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865), Alice&#x27;s body shrinks after drinking from a bottle labeled &quot;DRINK ME&quot;, after which she consumed a cake that made her so large that she almost touched the ceiling. These features of the story describes the macropsia and micropsia that are so characteristic to this disease.

These symptoms have been reported before in scientific literature, including World War I and II soldiers with occipital lesions, so Todd understood that he was not the first person to discover this phenomenon. Additionally, as early as 1933, other researchers such as Coleman and Lippman had compared these symptoms to the story of Alice in Wonderland. Caro Lippman was the first to hypothesize that the bodily changes that Alice encounters mimicked those of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s migraine symptoms. Others suggest that Carroll may have familiarized himself with these distorted perceptions through his knowledge of hallucinogenic mushrooms. It has been suggested that Carroll would have been aware of mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke&#x27;s description of the intoxicating effects of the fungus Amanita muscaria (commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita), in his books &quot;The Seven Sisters of Sleep&quot; and &quot;A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi.&quot;

===Notable cases===
* In 2018 it was suggested that the Italian artist and writer Giorgio de Chirico may have suffered from the syndrome.

== Society and culture ==
=== &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; ===
Alice in Wonderland syndrome&#x27;s symptom of micropsia has also been related to Jonathan Swift&#x27;s novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. It has been referred to as &quot;Lilliput sight&quot; and &quot;Lilliputian hallucination&quot;, a term coined by British physician Raoul Leroy in 1909.

=== &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; ===
Alice in Wonderland syndrome was named after Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 19th-century novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. In the story, Alice, the titular character, experiences numerous situations similar to those of micropsia and macropsia. The thorough descriptions of metamorphosis clearly described in the novel were the first of their kind to depict the bodily distortions associated with the condition. There is some speculation that Carroll may have written the story using his own direct experience with episodes of micropsia resulting from the numerous migraines he was known to experience. It has also been suggested that Carroll may have had temporal lobe epilepsy.

===&quot;House&quot;===
The condition is diagnosed in the season 8 episode &quot;Risky Business&quot;.

===Secret Garden===

In episode ten of the Korean drama &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, the leading man, Kim Joo Won, suspects that he is suffering from Alice in Wonderland syndrome.

===&quot;Doctors&quot;===
In April 2020, a case of Alice in Wonderland syndrome was covered in an episode of the BBC daytime soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;, when patient Hazel Gilmore (Alex Jarrett) experienced it.

<doc id="188522" wikidata="Q209576" url="?curid=188522" title="Ikaria">
<text>Ikaria, also spelled Icaria (, ), is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea, 10 nautical miles (19 km) southwest of Samos.

Administratively, Ikaria forms a separate municipality within the Ikaria regional unit, which is part of the North Aegean region. The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality is Agios Kirykos. The historic capitals of the island include Oenoe and Evdilos.

According to tradition, it derives its name from Icarus, the son of Daedalus in Greek mythology, who was believed to have fallen into the sea nearby and to have been buried on the island.

==Geography and climate==

Ikaria is one of the middle islands of the northern Aegean, in area with of coastline and a population of 8,312 inhabitants. The topography is a contrast between verdant slopes and barren steep rocks. The island is mountainous for the most part. It is traversed by the Aetheras range, whose highest summit is . Most of its villages are nestled in the plains near the coast, with some in the mountains.

Ikaria has a tradition of producing strong red wine. Many parts of the island, especially the ravines, are covered in shrubbery, making the landscape lush with green. Aside from domestic and domesticated species such as goats, there are a number of small wild animals to be found, such as martens, European otters, jumping spiders, and green toads. Ikaria exhibits a typical Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;).

==History==
Ikaria has been inhabited since at least 7000 BC, when it was populated by the Neolithic Pelasgians, a blanket term used by the ancient Greeks to refer to all pre-Hellenic peoples inhabiting the Greek region. Around 750 BC, Greeks from Miletus colonized Ikaria, establishing a settlement in the area of present-day Campos, which later became the ancient capital city of Oenoe. In antiquity, the island was called Icaria or Ikaria (), as today; and also Icarus or Ikaros (Ἴκαρος).

===Antiquity===
Ikaria became part of the sea empire of Polycrates during the 6th century BC, and during the 5th century BC, the Ikarian cities of Oenoe and Thermae were members of the Athenian-dominated Delian League. During the 2nd century, the island was colonized by Samos. At this time, the &quot;Tauropolion&quot;, the temple of Artemis was built at Oenoe.

Coins of the city represented Artemis and a bull. There was another, smaller &quot;temenos&quot; that was sacred to Artemis Tauropolos, at Nas, on the northwest coast of the island.

The sea around Ikaria had a fearsome reputation among the Ancients. Homer likened its changeability to a crowd stirred by demagogy: &quot;the gathering was stirred like the long sea-waves of the Ikarian main, which the East Wind or the South Wind has raised, rushing upon them from the clouds of father Zeus&quot; (Iliad II, 145), and Horace, too, in the opening of his Odes associates &quot;the African winds as they fight the Ikarian waves&quot; with shattered ships (Odes I.i.15–6). The island itself had two associative descriptive epithets: ‘Dolichi&#x27; (elongated) and ‘Ichtheoussa&#x27; (rich in fish). The name may originally have come from the Phoenician word for fish, ‘ikor&#x27;, rather than from associations with the mythical Icarus, whose fall was likely associated with the ancient &quot;deme&quot; of Icaria or Icarion in Attica.

In the later Fabulae (&quot;stories&quot;) of Hyginus the Greek versions of myth associated with Melanippe (otherwise Arne) and her sons Boeotus and Aeolus by Poseidon are amended to relate the story of Theano (otherwise Autolyte), wife of Metapontus, a king of Ikaria. Metapontus demanded that she bear him children, or leave the kingdom. She presented the exposed twin sons of Melanippe by Neptune to her husband, as if they were her own. Later Theano bore him two sons of her own and, wishing to leave the kingdom to her own children, sent them to kill Melanippe&#x27;s while out hunting. In the fight that ensued, her two sons were killed, and she committed suicide upon hearing the news. Metapontus later married Melanippe and her two sons founded towns in Propontis called by their names — Boeotia and Aeolia.

===Temple of Artemis at Nas===
Nas had been a sacred spot to the pre-Hellenic inhabitants of the Aegean, and Nas was an important island port in antiquity, the last stop before testing the dangerous seas around Ikaria. It was an appropriate location for sailors to make sacrifices to Artemis Tauropolos, who was a patron of seafarers; here, the goddess was represented in an archaic wooden &quot;xoanon&quot;.

The temple stood in good repair until the middle of the 19th century when the marble was pillaged, for their local church, by the Kato Raches villagers. In 1939, this church was excavated by the Greek archeologist Leon Politis. During the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II, many of the artifacts that were unearthed by Politis disappeared. Local tales state that the Germans and Italians stole the artifacts. According to local legend, marble artefacts from the temple still lie under the sand of the Nas beach where the temple stood.

In &quot;The Anabasis of Alexander&quot;, the second-century Greek historian Arrian recorded Aristobulus as saying that Alexander the Great had ordered that Failaka Island in the Persian Gulf should be called Icarus, after Ikaria in the Aegean Sea.

===Medieval Era===
In the 14th century CE, Ikaria was part of the Republic of Genoa&#x27;s possessions in the Aegean. At some point during this period the Ikarians destroyed their own ports to prevent the landing of unwanted visitors. According to local historians, the Ikarians, based on their own designs, built seven watchtowers along the coastlines. Once an unknown or enemy vessel appeared, the observers would at once light a fire at the top and run to a tank which was always filled with water. A wooden plug located at the base was pulled, and water would flow. The guards of the other watchtowers were alerted by the fire and repeated the process. In the inner side of each tower&#x27;s tank are marks identical to the ones measuring volumes in flasks. Each one of these marks was labelled with a different message on it, such as &quot;pirate attack&quot; or &quot;unknown ship approaching&quot;. Once the water level reached the mark signifying the appropriate message, the messengers would place the plug back on the tank and put out the fire, so that each of the other towers could decode the size and gravity of the incoming danger. The watchtowers on the island&#x27;s heights, such as the one in Drakano, were part of the islands&#x27; communication network since the time of the Delian League.

At the same time the Ikarians rarely built their houses in the form prevalent today. Each house was low, had a single room, a roof of stone slabs, and was distant from neighbouring ones. It had a single low door and the sea-facing side was protected with tall walls, while there was an opening on the roof (locally called the &quot;Anefantis&quot;). Because a chimney with smoke could betray the house&#x27;s location, it was often sealed. Smoke was poured through the roof slabs without being visible, while simultaneously clearing the wooden roof supports of insects. Rooms featured the bare necessities, such as a grinding stone and a cauldron. Traditionally, people would sleep on the floor and hide their belongings in the walls. Men and women wore almost the same clothing: sewn woollen skirts for women, a type of fustanella for the men. Later on the vest came to be worn by men and women. This frugal way of living contributed to the famed Ikarian longevity and the absence of distinct social classes. Each house was self-sufficient, using the living space around it for the cultivation of the necessary things, women contributed in work and social life. Villages were slowly created by descendants of an original family which gradually spread. Despite the sparse population, societal integrity was large. There were the panigiria (traditional festivals featuring dances, music and consumption of local products), team labor and elder councils who would take the decisions. This unique way of life and architecture was preserved until the end of the 19th century, with many elements surviving until today.

===Knights Hospitalier - Ottoman Era===
The Knights of St. John, who had their base in Rhodes, exerted some control over Ikaria until 1521, when the Ottoman Empire incorporated Ikaria into its realm. It was at this time that the problem of piracy reached new heights, where the islanders embraced the tactic of invisibility: they retreated to the island&#x27;s highlands, hiding their villages and homes. For defence against pirates, aside from this tactic (sparse habitation and hiding of residences) there were watchtowers, various points of concentration and defence (such as plateaus invisible from the sea) and communal hidden supplies to be used in time of need. Their theft was punishable even by death according to the common law of the time. Locals were reported attacking any unwanted visitors on their coastlines, even shipwrecked sailors.

The Ikarians lynched the first Turkish tax collector but managed to escape punishment. The oral story in regards to the event talks of an Ottoman Aga, who demanded two locals to carry him on their shoulders atop a seat. The carriers, unable to accept the forcefulness, threw him off a cliff in the Kako Katavasidi area. The Turkish authorities rounded up the population and demanded to know who the perpetrator was, but the answer they received according to legend was &quot;all of us, milord&quot;. The Turks realistically determined that there was neither profit nor honour in punishing all.

The Ottomans imposed a very loose administration, not sending any officials to Ikaria for several centuries, although in later years they would appoint groups of locals in each village of the island to act as Kodjabashis in order to collect taxes for the empire. The best account that we have of the island during the early years of the Ottoman rule is from the Archbishop J. Georgirenes, who in 1677 described the island as having almost 1,000 hardy, long-lived inhabitants, who were the poorest people in the Aegean.

Without a decent port —the local population destroyed the island&#x27;s ports long ago to protect themselves from pirate raids— Ikaria depended for its very limited trade with the outside world upon small craft that were drawn up on the beaches. Ikarian boat-makers had a good reputation for building boats from the island&#x27;s fir forests. Then they sold boats and lumber for coin and grain in nearby Chios. The inshore waters of the island, as told by Georgirenes, provided the best cockle shellfish in the archipelago. Over the centuries, Ikaria would also become renowned for its charcoal, which became known as &quot;Carbon Cariot&quot; (&quot;Ikarian Charcoal&quot;).

Goats and sheep roamed virtually untended in the rocky landscape. Cheeses were made for consumption in every household. Ikaria in the 17th century was unusual in the archipelago in not producing any wine for export. The people kept barrels of the wine for their own drinking. They also continued to store it in the old-fashioned way prevalent since the Bronze Age, in terracotta &quot;pithoi&quot; containers sunk to their rims in earth, thus protecting their supplies from both tax collectors and pirates.

Apart from three small towns, none of which exceeded 100 houses, and numerous village settlements, each house had a walled orchard and a garden plot. Unlike the closely built towns of Samos, the hardy inhabitants lived separately in fortified unfurnished farmsteads.

In 1827, during the Greek War of Independence, Ikaria broke away from the Ottoman Empire, but was not included in the narrow territory of the original independent Greece, and it was forced to accept Ottoman rule once more a few years later.

===Free State of Ikaria===


Ikaria remained part of the Ottoman Empire until 17 July 1912, when the Ikarians expelled the Turkish garrison and thereby achieved independence. After its independence and the outbreak of the First Balkan War, Ikaria&#x27;s sole &quot;warship&quot;, the &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, was used to provide food and supplies to the islands of Samos and Chios, which were captured by the Greek Navy during the war.

George N. Spanos (c. 1872–1912) of Evdilos, killed in a Turkish ambush on 17 July 1912, is honoured as the hero of the Ikarian Revolution. His bust, depicting him defiantly, with bandoliers on his body and rifle in hand, may be seen at the memorial established in his honour at the site of his death located in the Ikarian town of Chrysostomos.

On 18 July 1912, the Free State of Ikaria (Ελευθέρα Πολιτεία Ικαρίας, &quot;Elefthéra Politía Ikarías&quot;) was declared. The neighboring islands of Fournoi Korseon were also liberated and became part of the Free State. Ioannis Malachias (Ιωάννης Μαλαχίας) was the first and only president of the Free State of Ikaria.

For five months, it remained an independent country, with its own government, armed forces, national flag, coat of arms, postage stamps, and national anthem. These five months were difficult for the island&#x27;s economy. There were food shortages and they were at risk of becoming part of the Italian Dodecanese. On 4 November 1912, after a delay due to the Balkan Wars, Ikaria officially became part of the Kingdom of Greece. The Ottoman Empire recognized Greece&#x27;s annexation of Ikaria and the other Aegean islands in the Treaty of London (1913).

===Second World War===

The island suffered losses in property and lives during the Second World War as the result of the Italian and then German occupation. There are no exact figures on how many people starved, but in the village of Karavostamo alone over 100 perished from starvation.

===&quot;Red Rock&quot;===

After the ravages of the war the nationalists and communists fought in the Greek Civil War (1946–49), and the Greek government used the island to exile about 13,000 communists. To this date, the majority of the locals have remained sympathetic to left parties and communism, and, for this reason, Ikaria is referred to by some as the &quot;Red Rock&quot; (Κόκκινος Βράχος, &quot;Kokkinos Vrahos&quot;).

In his analysis, &quot;Rebels and Radicals: Icaria 1600–2000&quot;, historian Anthony J. Papalas (East Carolina University) examines modern Ikaria in the light of such 20th-century questions as poverty, emigration to America, the nature of the Axis occupation, the rise of Communism, the Greek Civil War, and the rightwing reaction to radical postwar movements.

===Modern era===
The quality of life improved greatly after 1960, when the Greek government began to invest in the infrastructure of the island to assist in the promotion of tourism. Today, Ikaria is considered one of the world&#x27;s five &quot;Blue zones&quot; – places where the population regularly lives to an advanced age (one in three make it to their 90s). This is due to healthy diet, lifestyle, and genetics. The Ikaria Study, published in 2011, sought to understand the factors that contributed to longevity. The study also showed the high rate of sexual intercourse among elderly men; 80% of Ikarian males aged between 65 and 100 were found to still be having sex on a regular basis.

==Demographics==
The inhabitants of the island are known as Ikarians or Icariots. (, &quot;Ikariótes&quot;).

An Ikarian diaspora is found throughout Greece, specifically on Thimena and Fournoi Korseon, as well as in Athens, where a large community is found. The people of Ikarian diaspora can be found throughout the world, mainly in Australia, the United States, Canada, Egypt and the United Kingdom.

Ikarian Greeks are closely related to other Aegean island Greeks, such as Greeks from Samos, Chios, Fournoi Korseon, and Patmos, as well as Greeks from Anatolia.

Archeological Museum of Kampos
The Archaeological Museum, located in the village of Kambos, stands on a hill which was once the ancient fortress of Oinoe, and is immediately next to Agia Irini, Ikaria&#x27;s oldest church. The museum contains over 250 artifacts, including Neolithic tools, pottery vessels, clay statuettes, columns, coins, and carved headstones.

Archeological Museum of Agios Kirykos
Housed in the former lycee of Agios Kirykos, which was built by immigrant Ikarians living in America, the recently renovated neoclassical building dating to 1925 is the home of Ikaria&#x27;s Archeological Museum . This listed building will house all of Ikaria&#x27;s most relevant finds and highlight the history and culture of the island in the facilities of a modern museum and research/conservation center.

Complete with multimedia displays and films dedicated to the Myth of Ikaros and the ancient citadel of Drakano, the museum presents Ikaria&#x27;s archeological findings and relates to the visitor an understanding of the cultural, commercial and social development of the settlements of ancient Ikaria throughout the course of the island&#x27;s history.

Folk &amp; Historical Museum Of Agios Kirykos
Located in Agios Kirykos, The Folk &amp; History Museum of Agios Kirykos in Ikaria was launched in July 2010, and is the result of the long efforts by Professor Themistocles Katsaros. Its mission is to preserve and promote Ikarian folklore, traditions and customs through its display of over 1,500 objects that reflect the history and heritage of Ikaria and its inhabitants.
The museum exhibits items of cultural importance from the island, including dresses, textiles, household articles, pottery, agriculture and trade tools &amp; instruments, photos, documents and many other objects.

Of particular interest amongst the items displayed in the museum is the flag of the Free State of Ikaria (1912). 
Some of the exhibits have been organised thematically and chronologically, so that objects and images give visitors an idea of social and economic life in Ikaria from the 18th century to the 1970s, when traditional life still continued in the region.

Folklore Museum Of Vrakades
The Folklore Museum of Vrakades is located in the scenic village of Vrakades, 650 meters above sea level on the north-western side of the island. The village was founded in the 17th century and contains old stone houses and captains&#x27; villas of architectural note. The museum houses an interesting collection of items related to the history and people of the region. Of particular interest are documents and memorabilia from the Free State of Ikaria.

Other exhibits include various clay and wooden objects used by housewives, beekeepers, and farmers, ecclesiastical relics from Profit Elias in Vrakades and the convent of Evagelistrias Mavrianou, books by Ikarian writers, Ikarian records and documents over 500 years old. Of note is the cutter, &quot;lanari&quot; in Greek, used for the processing of wool and goat hairs from which the modest local clothing was made, the &quot;lisgos&quot;, a simple tool used for making ropes, an old digging tool, and many other tools belonging to the first inhabitants of the island.

<doc id="188523" wikidata="Q614763" url="?curid=188523" title="Macropsia">
<text>Macropsia is a neurological condition affecting human visual perception, in which objects within an affected section of the visual field appear larger than normal, causing the person to feel smaller than they actually are. Macropsia, along with its opposite condition, micropsia, can be categorized under dysmetropsia. Macropsia is related to other conditions dealing with visual perception, such as aniseikonia and Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS, also known as Todd&#x27;s syndrome). Macropsia has a wide range of causes, from prescription and illicit drugs, to migraines and (rarely) complex partial epilepsy, and to different retinal conditions, such as epiretinal membrane. Physiologically, retinal macropsia results from the compression of cones in the eye. It is the compression of receptor distribution that results in greater stimulation and thus a larger perceived image of an object.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most obvious symptom of macropsia is the presence of exceptionally enlarged objects throughout the visual field. For example, a young girl might see her sister&#x27;s books as the same size as her sister. Stemming from this symptom, someone with macropsia may feel undersized in relation to his or her surrounding environment. Patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination, indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination. A buzzing sound in the ears has also been reported immediately before macropsia development. Some patients claim that symptoms may be eased if an attempt is made to physically touch the object which appears enormous in size. It is important to note, however, that patients typically remain lucid and alert throughout episodes, being able to recount specific details. A person with macropsia may have no psychiatric conditions. Symptoms caused chemically by drugs such as cannabis, magic mushrooms, or cocaine tend to dissipate after the chemical compound has been excreted from the body. Those who acquire macropsia as a symptom of a virus usually experience complete recovery and restoration of normal vision.

Dysmetropsia in one eye, a case of aniseikonia, can present with symptoms such as headaches, asthenopia, reading difficulties, depth perception problems, or double vision. The visual distortion can cause uncorrelated images to stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion of the images. Without suppression of one of the images symptoms from mild poor stereopsis, binocular diplopia and intolerable rivalry can occur.

=== Psychological effects ===
There are a broad range of psychological and emotional effects that a person with macropsia may experience. One competing theory has radically stated that macropsia may be an entirely psychological pathological phenomenon without any structural defect or definite cause. They may be in an irritable or angry state, or in contrast, a euphoric state. There is evidence that those who experience Alice in Wonderland Syndrome and associated macropsia are able to recount their experiences with thorough detail. There may be no evidence of psychiatric disturbance and, as a result, no psychiatric therapy may be required. Psychological conditions often arise from macropsia, but the general consensus is that they do not cause macropsia. Those affected may experience extreme anxiety both during and after episodes as a result of the overwhelming nature of his or her distorted visual field. Due to the fear and anxiety associated with the condition, those who have previously had an episode hesitate to recount the episode, although retain the ability to do so. Psychologically, a person with macropsia may feel separation and dissociation from the outside world and even from immediate family. This feeling of dissociation has mostly been noted in child or adolescent patients. The patient may feel that he or she must unfairly contend with hostile and aggressive forces due to the gigantic nature of the surrounding environment. The defense against said forces is usually expressed verbally. The patient may falsely present an outgoing or flamboyant persona, while remaining fearful of people internally. He or she, in an attempt to balance the size distortion, may try to make others feel small in size through insult or hostile behavior. The psychological impact of macropsia on long-time people who have had the condition since childhood may be greater and lead to severe ego-deficiencies. An alternative interpretation of the condition is that macropsia is a response to biophysiological contraction and has no psychological roots. Thus, when a patient reaches for an enlarged object, he or she is overcoming that physiological contraction. However, this theory has been under much scrutiny.

==Causes==

===Structural defects===
In cases where macropsia affects one eye resulting in differences in the way the two eyes perceive the size or shape of images, the condition is known as aniseikonia. Aniseikonia is known to be associated with certain retinal conditions. Epiretinal membrane has been found to cause metamorphopsia and aniseikonia. Vitreomacular traction caused by the excessive adhesion of vitreous fluid to the retina is related to aniseikonia due to the separation and compression of photoreceptor cells. Macular edema and surgical re-attachment for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment can also cause an increased separation of macular photoreceptor cells resulting in dysmetropsia. Retinoschisis is another eye disease that has been shown to cause aniseikonia.

There is evidence that a lesion appearing in the posterior area of the ventral occipitotemporal visual pathway can cause macropsia. This lesion can be due to an ischemic cell death after an acute posterior cerebral infarction.

===Medications===
The most prevalent research on prescription drugs with side effects of macropsia deals with zolpidem and citalopram. Zolpidem is a drug prescribed for insomnia, and although it has proven beneficial effects, there have been numerous reported cases of adverse perceptual reactions. One of these cases discusses an anorexic woman&#x27;s episode of macropsia, which occurred twenty minutes after taking 10 mg zolpidem. The same woman later had two more episodes of zolpidem-induced macropsia, after taking 5 mg and 2.5 mg zolpidem, respective to each episode. The intensity of the macropsia episodes decreased with the decreasing amount of zolpidem administered; it is implied in the article that the level of intensity was based on the patients accounts of her macropsia episodes, and that no external diagnosis was used. Hoyler points out notable similarities among the different reported cases of zolpidem-induced disorganization. The similarities were that all the cases were reported by women, the disorganization and agitation followed the first administration of zolpidem, and once zolpidem was discontinued, there were no lasting residual effects. It is believed that zolpidem-related macropsia is more prevalent in women because plasma zolpidem concentration is 40% higher in women, a concentration that further increases in anorexic women.

Citalopram-induced macropsia is similar to zolpidem-induced macropsia since both types have been observed in relatively few cases, and neither of the drugs&#x27; side effects can be supported by experimental evidence. Citalopram is an antidepressant that inhibits serotonin reuptake. The first case of macropsia thought to be induced by citalopram involves a woman who experienced macropsia after her first administration of 10 mg citalopram. Just as with zolpidem, after the immediate discontinuation of citalopram, there were no further episodes of macropsia.

=== Illicit drugs ===
There are suggestions that visual distortions, such as macropsia, can be associated with cocaine use. Episodes of temporary drug-induced macropsia subside as the chemicals leave the body.

===Migraine===
Past research has linked macropsia to migraine. One of these studies was conducted on Japanese adolescents who reported visual episodic illusions with macropsia and showed that illusions are three times more likely to occur in association with migraine. The illusions were most prevalent among girls between the ages of 16 and 18. It is unlikely that macropsia in Japanese adolescents could be due to epileptic seizure since only 0.3% of Japanese adolescents have epilepsy. No evidence of drugs was found, which eliminates the possibility of the macropsia in the adolescents being drug-induced. It is also unlikely for macropsia in adolescent children to be associated with a serious disease. It is usually the macropsia or other visual disturbance which precedes the painful migrainous headaches. The episodes of macropsia can occur as part of the aura in a migraine. These episodes are often brief, lasting only a few minutes. Adolescents who are deemed to have multiple distortions per episode, such as slow motion vision and macropsia, are even more likely to be people with migraine. The macropsia episodes associated with migraine are typically equivalent to the duration of the aura, which can range from moments to 15 minutes. Non-migrainous headaches are not known to be associated with episodic illusions. Even in the absence of a migraine, a fever or a hypnogogic state can provoke visual illusions, which one might claim to be macropsia. A person with macropsia may fail to see the connection between the migraine and the macropsia, since the conditions may not elicit symptoms at the same time. The pathophysiology of the condition is not fully understood, but the timing of some episodic occurrences with the headaches suggests that there is a connection between macropsia and the vasoconstrictive phase of a migraine. The differences in visual phenomena, such as macropsia with slow motion versus macropsia without slow motion, may result from different areas of the brain being affected by migraine.

===Epilepsy===
Macropsia may present itself as a symptom of both frontal lobe epilepsy and temporal lobe epilepsy, which may actually help in the diagnosis of those diseases. Children who experience nocturnal hallucinations accompanied by macropsia may seek medical care for panic attack disorders and instead are diagnosed with forms of epilepsy. Epilepsy patients may have no memory of the seizure, but can remember the hallucinations and aura which proceed the attack. Electroencephalography, or EEG imaging, can then be utilized while the patient experiences the episode. It may be subsequently concluded that the EEG is congruent with temporal or frontal lobe seizure. Anxiety and headaches accompany the episodes of visual distortion associated with epilepsy. While Valproic acid has been used to treat this type of seizure, anti-seizure medications appropriate for focal-onset seizures, like oxcarbazapine, have also been used successfully in the treatment of epilepsy-related macropsia.

===Hypoglycaemia===
Endogenous hypoglycaemia can result in number of visual disturbances and sometimes macropsia. This kind of hypoglycaemia is defined as having an abnormally low blood-sugar level due to anything other than the exogenous administration of insulin. Macropsia has been observed in experimental hypoglycaemia and in patients receiving insulin therapy.

===Viruses===
Patients with both Epstein-Barr virus and infectious mononucleosis have cited an increase in the sizes of perceived objects, coinciding with other symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Additionally, it has been observed that Epstein-Barr patients who cite hallucinations display abnormal MRI scans. The MRI may show swelling of the cerebral cortex, transient T2 prolongation, and transient lesions. Unlike in MRI&#x27;s, no abnormalities have been reported in CT scans. It is thus recommended that an Epstein-Barr patient who cites visual hallucinations have an MRI scan. Macropsia may appear either before the onset, or after the resolution, of all clinical symptoms associated with the illness. The duration of the disturbances have been shown to range between two weeks and seven months. Almost all patients with macropsia due to infectious mononucleosis make full recoveries. Patients with Coxsackievirus B1 have reported numerous symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, the most common of which being macropsia and micropsia.

==Pathophysiology==
Macropsia may be a result of optical magnification differences between the eyes, retinal receptor distribution, or the cortical processing of the sampled image. The current hypothesis for the occurrence of dysmetropsia is due to the stretching or compression of the retina leading to the displacement of receptors. Macropsia arises from a compressed receptor distribution leading to a larger perceived image size and conversely, micropsia results from stretching of the retina leading to a more sparse receptor distribution that gives a smaller perceived image size. In the case of macropsia, the greater density of photoreceptor cells leads to greater stimulation making the object seem larger. In some cases, the effects of macropsia have been shown to be field dependent, in that the degree of visual distortion is related to the visual field angle. Non-uniform stretching or compression of the receptor distribution could explain the field dependency of the macropsia. If the compression forces were closer to the fovea the resulting compression would cause a greater amount of macropsia at lower field angles with little effect at higher field angles where the receptor distribution is not as compressed. Alterations in receptor distribution can be the result of epiretinal membrane, neuroretina detachment and/or re-attachment, or retinoschisis. Macropsia caused by surgical re-attachment of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is not symmetrical around the fovea, resulting in differences size changes in the horizontal and vertical meridians. Asymmetry has also been observed with retinoschisis, in which macropsia generally results in the vertical direction while micropsia presents in the horizontal direction.

==Diagnosis==
Macropsia is generally diagnosed once a patient complains of the characteristic symptoms, such as disproportionally large objects in their visual field. The Amsler Grid test can be used to diagnose macropsia, along with other visual maladies depending on the subjective disturbance reported by the patient after looking at the Amsler Grid. Outward bulging of the lines on an Amsler Grid is consistent with patients experiencing macropsisa. The New Aniseikonia Test (NAT) can quantify the degree of macropsia or micropsia independently in the vertical and horizontal meridians. The test consists of red and green semicircles on a black background with a white round fixation target. The size of the red semicircle is held constant while the green semicircle is varied in size in 1% increments. The patient wears a pair of red/green goggles so that one eye is tested at a time, and the patient attempts to determine when the semicircles are the same size. This is termed the reversal threshold and the size difference between the semicircles is reported as the degree of aniseikonia. A positive value indicates that the object was perceived bigger and thus corresponds to macropsia, and conversely a negative value indicates micropsia. The Aniseikonia Inspector contains an aniseikonia test based on the same principles as the NAT, but the test is run on a computer screen, it is based on a forced choice method, and it can measure the size difference as a function of the size of the objects. The functionality of being able to measure the size difference as function of the size (i.e. field dependent testing) is especially important when the macropsia (or micropsia) has a retinal origin.

==Treatment==
The most common way to treat forms of aniseikonia, including macropsia, is through the use of auxiliary optics to correct for the magnification properties of the eyes. This method includes changing the shape of spectacle lenses, changing the vertex distances with contact lenses, creating a weak telescope system with contact lenses and spectacles, and changing the power of one of the spectacle lenses. Computer software, such as the Aniseikonia Inspector, has been developed to determine the prescription needed to correct for a certain degree of aniseikonia. The problem with correction through optical means is that the optics do not vary with field angle and thus cannot compensate for non-uniform macropsia. Patients have reported significantly improved visual comfort associated with a correction of 5-10% of the aniseikonia.

With regard to drug-induced or virus-induced macropsia, once the underlying problem, either drug abuse or viral infection, is treated, the induced macropsia ceases.

==Research==
Future research may focus on ways to limit the occurrence of retinally-induced macropsia due to surgery. In terms of treatment, the most effective optical correction is still being researched with respect to visual field angles and direction to a target. The susceptibility of certain age demographics to macropsia is a subject that requires further validation. Overall, there have not been very many reports of macropsia induced by certain drugs, specifically zolpidem and citalopram. Once a larger effort is made to compile such reports, there will inevitably be more research on the subject of macropsia.

<doc id="188524" wikidata="Q1881849" url="?curid=188524" title="Cytopathology">
<text>Cytopathology (from Greek , &quot;kytos&quot;, &quot;a hollow&quot;; , &quot;pathos&quot;, &quot;fate, harm&quot;; and , &quot;-logia&quot;) is a branch of pathology that studies and diagnoses diseases on the cellular level. The discipline was founded by George Nicolas Papanicolaou in 1928. Cytopathology is generally used on samples of free cells or tissue fragments, in contrast to histopathology, which studies whole tissues. Cytopathology is frequently, less precisely, called &quot;cytology&quot;, which means &quot;the study of cells&quot;.

Cytopathology is commonly used to investigate diseases involving a wide range of body sites, often to aid in the diagnosis of cancer but also in the diagnosis of some infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions. For example, a common application of cytopathology is the Pap smear, a screening tool used to detect precancerous cervical lesions that may lead to cervical cancer.

Cytopathologic tests are sometimes called smear tests because the samples may be smeared across a glass microscope slide for subsequent staining and microscopic examination. However, cytology samples may be prepared in other ways, including cytocentrifugation. Different types of smear tests may also be used for cancer diagnosis. In this sense, it is termed a &quot;cytologic smear&quot;.

==Cell collection==
There are two methods of collecting cells for cytopathologic analysis: exfoliative cytology, and intervention cytology.

===Exfoliative cytology===

In this method, cells are collected after they have been either spontaneously shed by the body (&quot;spontaneous exfoliation&quot;), or manually scraped/brushed off of a surface in the body (&quot;mechanical exfoliation&quot;). An example of spontaneous exfoliation is when cells of the pleural cavity or peritoneal cavity are shed into the pleural or peritoneal fluid. This fluid can be collected via various methods for examination. Examples of mechanical exfoliation include Pap smears, where cells are scraped from the cervix with a cervical spatula, or bronchial brushings, where a bronchoscope is inserted into the trachea and used to evaluate a visible lesion by brushing cells from its surface and subjecting them to cytopathologic analysis.

===Intervention cytology===

In intervention cytology the pathologist intervenes into the body for sample collection.

====Fine-needle aspiration====

Fine-needle aspiration, or fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), involves use of a needle attached to a syringe to collect cells from lesions or masses in various body organs by microcoring, often with the application of negative pressure (suction) to increase yield. FNAC can be performed under palpation guidance (i.e., the clinician can feel the lesion) on a mass in superficial regions like the neck, thyroid or breast; FNAC may be assisted by ultrasound or CAT scan for sampling of deep-seated lesions within the body that cannot be localized via palpation. FNAC is widely used in many countries, but success rate is dependent on the skill of the practitioner. If performed by a pathologist alone, or as team with pathologist-cytotechnologist, the success rate of proper diagnosis is higher than when performed by a non-pathologist. This may be due to the pathologist&#x27;s ability to immediately evaluate specimens under a microscope and immediately repeat the procedure if sampling was inadequate.

Fine needles are 23 to 27 gauge. Because needles as small as 27 gauge can almost always yield diagnostic material, FNAC is often the least injurious way to obtain diagnostic tissue from a lesion. Sometimes a syringe holder may be used to facilitate using one hand to perform the biopsy while the other hand is immobilizing the mass. Imaging equipment such as a CT scanner or ultrasound may be used to assist in locating the region to be biopsied.

FNAC has become synonymous to interventional cytology.

====Sediment cytology====
For cytology of sediment, the sample is collected from the fixative that was used for processing the biopsy or autopsy specimen. The fixative is mixed properly and taken into a centrifuge tube and is centrifuged. The sediment is used for smearing. These sediments are the cells that are shed by the autopsy and biopsy specimen during processing.

===Imprint cytology===
Imprint cytology is a preparation wherein the tissue of interest touches a glass slide, leaving behind its imprint in the form of cells on the slide. The imprint can subsequently be stained and studied.

==Preparation==
After sampling, two main techniques for processing are used:
* &quot;Smearing&quot; of sample directly onto a glass slide.
* Liquid-based cytology. With the latter, the sample is placed in a liquid that is then processed for further investigation.

Processing of specimens may result in visual artifacts:
For better visualization of cells and their components, specimens are inked, such as by the Papanicolaou stain, or Romanowsky stain derivatives which include Giemsa, Jenner, Wright, Field, May–Grünwald and Leishman stains.

==Parameters==
The nucleus of the cell is very important in evaluating the cellular sample. In cancerous cells, altered DNA activity can be seen as a physical change in the nuclear qualities. Since more DNA is unfolded and being expressed, the nucleus will be darker and less uniform, larger than in normal cells, and often show a bright-red nucleolus.

While the cytologist&#x27;s primary responsibility is to discern whether cancerous or precancerous pathology is present in the cellular sample analysed, other pathologies may be seen such as:
* microbial infections: parasitic, viral, and/or bacterial
* reactive changes
* immune reactions
* cell aging
* amyloidosis
* autoimmune diseases

Various normal functions of cell growth, metabolism, and division can fail or work in abnormal ways and lead to diseases.

Cytopathology is best used as one of three tools, the second and third being the physical examination and medical imaging. Cytology can be used to diagnose a condition and spare a patient from surgery to obtain a larger specimen. An example is thyroid FNAC; many benign conditions can be diagnosed with a superficial biopsy and the patient can go back to normal activities right away. If a malignant condition is diagnosed, the patient may be able to start radiation/chemotherapy, or may need to have surgery to remove and/or stage the cancer.

Some tumors may be difficult to biopsy, such as sarcomas. Other rare tumors may be dangerous to biopsy, such as pheochromocytoma. In general, a fine-needle aspiration can be done anywhere it is safe to put a needle, including liver, lung, kidney, and superficial masses.

Proper cytopathology technique takes time to master. Cytotechnologists and cytopathologists can assist clinicians by assisting with sample collection. A &quot;quick read&quot; is a peek under the microscope and can tell the clinician whether enough diagnostic material was obtained. Cytological specimens must be properly prepared so that the cells are not damaged.

Further information about the specimen may be gained by immunohistochemical stains and molecular testing, particularly if the sample is prepared using liquid based cytology. Often &quot;reflex&quot; testing is performed, such as HPV testing on an abnormal pap test or flow cytometry on a lymphoma specimen.

==Body regions==
Cytopathologic techniques are used in the examination of virtually all body organs and tissues:
* Gynecologic cytology – concerning the female reproductive tract
* Urinary tract cytology – concerning the ureters, urinary bladder and urethra. See Urine cytology.
* Effusion cytology – concerning fluids collections, especially within the peritoneum, pleura and pericardium
* Breast cytology – principally concerning the female breast
* Vaginal cytology - principally concerning non-human mammals
* Thyroid cytology – concerning the thyroid gland
* Lymph node cytology – concerning lymph nodes
* Respiratory cytology – concerning the lungs and airways
* Gastrointestinal cytology – concerning the alimentary tract
* Soft tissue, bone and skin cytology

<doc id="188527" wikidata="Q5359859" url="?curid=188527" title="Elf Power">
<text>Elf Power is an American indie rock band that originated in Athens, Georgia, United States. The line-up consists of guitarist/vocalist Andrew Rieger, keyboardist Laura Carter, guitarist Dave Wrathgabar, bassist Bryan Poole, and drummer Peter Alvanos. They are part of the Elephant Six Collective.

==History==
The band began as a four-track recording project of Rieger, Carter, Raleigh Hatfield and Dave Wrathgabar, later of Fablefactory. These recording sessions eventually resulted in the first incarnation of their debut album &quot;Vainly Clutching at Phantom Limbs&quot;. The band&#x27;s line-up expanded when Rieger and Carter recruited Elephant Six musician Bryan Poole, also known as The Late B.P. Helium. While the band occasionally played live shows and continued to record, Poole chiefly stayed in Athens to continue work with Of Montreal while Rieger and Carter moved to New York City.

===Mid–late 1990s===
After residing in New York for some time, the band released &quot;The Winter Hawk EP&quot; in 1996. Eventually, Rieger and Carter were convinced to move back to Athens, where the band&#x27;s second album &quot;When the Red King Comes&quot; was ultimately recorded and released as a joint venture between the Arena Rock Recording Co. and the Elephant Six label. The album featured contributions by members of The Olivia Tremor Control, Kevin Barnes of Of Montreal, and Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel.

Shortly following the release of &quot;When the Red King Comes&quot;, Elf Power collaborated with Dave Fridmann, best known for his work with The Flaming Lips, to record the album &quot;A Dream in Sound&quot;. The album was again recorded with the help of Mangum and Barnes, as well as Scott Spillane of Neutral Milk Hotel and The Gerbils.

During the 1999 supporting tour for &quot;A Dream in Sound&quot;, Adrian Finch joined the band to play violin. Following the addition, the band recorded an EP focused chiefly on cover material entitled &quot;Come On&quot;. Around this time, &quot;Vainly Clutching at Phantom Limbs&quot; was reissued with material from early sessions.

===Early–mid-2000s===
The band regrouped in late 2000 to record &quot;The Winter Is Coming&quot;, again with help from members of other Elephant Six bands. Notably, the band spent this time as a supporting act for fellow Athens band R.E.M., as well as Wilco. Bryan Poole would exit the band for good following the European tour for the album to focus on solo work.

2002 saw the release of two albums from the band: &quot;Creatures&quot;, an effort released by spinART, and &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Going to Happen&quot;, an album released on Orange Twin Records that contained various cover songs and the Come On EP. During this time, Finch left the lineup and Ballard Lesemann stepped in to play bass.

In 2004, Elf Power released their seventh studio album &quot;Walking with the Beggar Boys&quot;. The album was released to notable media and critical praise and featured contributions from Vic Chesnutt.

The band released &quot;Back to the Web&quot; on Rykodisc in April 2006, an album which featured bassist Derek Almstead. A tour of the United States and Europe followed. They were also chosen to play in the United Kingdom 2006 All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival curated by The Shins.

===2008–present===
The band&#x27;s ninth album &quot;In a Cave&quot; was released in March 2008 on Rykodisc. Their MySpace page first described the project as &quot;a lushly orchestrated mix of eclectic songwriting that is sure to conjure up memories of 1997&#x27;s &quot;When the Red King Comes&quot;&quot; and stressed its &quot;more mature approach to arrangements, lyrics, and instrumentation.&quot;

Elf Power collaborated with Vic Chesnutt on &quot;Dark Developments&quot;, released on Orange Twin in 2008. It was supported by U.S. and European tours.

Aaron Wegelin, who drummed on the first five Elf Power albums, died on February 2, 2021.

In 2022, Elf Power released their twelfth album &quot;Artificial Countrysides&quot; on Yep Roc Records.

<doc id="188530" wikidata="Q1197093" url="?curid=188530" title="Humanity Declaration">
<text>The is an imperial rescript issued by Hirohito, the emperor of Japan, as part of a New Year&#x27;s statement on 1 January 1946 at the request of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. In the rescript, which started with his citation of the Five Charter Oath of 1868, the Emperor denied the concept of his divinity, which would eventually lead to the promulgation of the new Constitution, under which the Emperor is &quot;the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people&quot;.

==The Declaration==
Delivery of this rescript was to be one of the Emperor&#x27;s last acts as the imperial Sovereign. The Supreme Commander Allied Powers and the Western world in general gave great attention to the following passage towards the end of the rescript:

This first draft of this rescript is said to have been drafted by Japanese cultural scholars Reginald Horace Blyth and Harold Gould Henderson, who also contributed to the popularisation of Zen and the poetic form of haiku outside Japan.

==Interpretation==
The exact meaning of this text, which was published in archaic Japanese, has been the subject of considerable debate. In particular, in the passage of the declaration which was officially translated as &quot;false conception according to which the emperor is divine&quot;, the unusual term was used instead of the more common word means &quot;exist&quot; or &quot;appear&quot;, means &quot;person&quot; and means &quot;god&quot;. The word was first mentioned in the (), where the legendary Japanese prince Yamato Takeru said &quot;I am the son of an .&quot; 

===Western view===
According to the popular Western view, promoted by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the rescript challenged the centuries-old claim that the Japanese emperor and his predecessors were descendants of the sun goddess Amaterasu, and thus the Emperor had now publicly admitted that he was not a living god. Thus, the same day as the rescript was issued, General Douglas MacArthur announced that he was very much pleased with the Emperor&#x27;s statement, which he saw as his commitment to lead his people in the democratisation of Japan.

Although is often translated as &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;divinity&quot;, some Western scholars (including John W. Dower and Herbert P. Bix) have pointed out that its real meaning is &quot;manifest &quot; (or, more generally, &quot;incarnation of a god&quot;), and that therefore the emperor would still be, according to the declaration, an (&quot;living god&quot;), although not an (&quot;manifest &quot;). In fact, Jean Herbert explains that, according to the Japanese tradition, the figure of the emperor would be &quot;the extension in time&quot; of the goddess Amaterasu and the previous emperors, representing a privileged moment in eternity. Consequently, it would be inadmissible to deny its divine origin.&quot;

===Japanese view===
On 1 January 1946, the rescript was reported on the front page of many major newspapers. The headline was &quot;New year&#x27;s day rescript paves way for peace and progress for the people as Emperor laments confusion of ideals.&quot; The headline was, &quot;Rescript presented in the new year: The bonds of society are trust, respect, the Emperor, and the People.&quot; The newspaper headlines did not mention divinity, only that peace and the emperor were with the people. The emperor&#x27;s refutation of divinity was not valuable as news.

Critics of the Western interpretation, including Emperor Shōwa himself, argue that the repudiation of divinity was not the point of the rescript. Some argue that since this rescript starts with a full quote from the Five Charter Oath of 1868 by Emperor Meiji, the Emperor&#x27;s true intention was that Japan had already been democratic since the Meiji Era and was not democratized by the occupiers. As was clarified in a press interview on 23 August 1977, the Emperor wanted the Japanese people not to forget pride in Japan. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the imperial rescript was published with a commentary by Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara that dwelt exclusively on the prior existence of democracy in the Meiji Era and did not make even passing reference to the emperor&#x27;s &quot;renunciation of divinity.&quot;

Emperor Shōwa was persistent in the idea that the emperor of Japan should be considered a descendant of the gods. In December 1945, he told his vice-grand chamberlain Michio Kinoshita: &quot;It is permissible to say that the idea that the Japanese are descendants of the gods is a false conception; but it is absolutely impermissible to call chimerical the idea that the emperor is a descendant of the gods.&quot; Shinto officials and right-wing groups throughout Japan today do not recognize the declaration as admitting that the emperor and country are not divine. 

The English rescript was discovered in 2005 and was published in the on 1 January 2006. Professor Osamu Watanabe sent the following comments to the newspaper:

The Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Maeda Tamon, along with Gakushuin University director Katsunoshin Yamanashi and Prime Minister Kijuro Shidehara, are key figures in Japan who have read and examined the draft of the Humanity Declaration. He was also a Quaker and, like many Japanese Christians, revered the emperor. In December 1945, he answered in a question and answer session of the Imperial Diet that &quot;the emperor is a god&quot;. &quot;It is not a god of Western concept, but &#x27;in the sense that it is the highest level in the world in the traditional Japanese concept&#x27; is a god&quot;, he replied.

<doc id="188533" wikidata="Q708236" url="?curid=188533" title="Ronnie Lane">
<text>Ronald Frederick Lane (1 April 1946 – 4 June 1997) was an English musician and songwriter who was the bassist and co-founder of the rock bands Small Faces (1965–69) and Faces (1969–73).

Lane formed Small Faces in 1965 after meeting Steve Marriott, with whom he subsequently wrote many of their hit singles including &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot; and &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;. After Marriott left Small Faces in 1968, band members Lane, Ian McLagan and Kenny Jones were joined by Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood to form Faces. Like Small Faces, the band achieved critical and commercial success. Lane quit the Faces in 1973 and subsequently collaborated with other musicians, leading his own bands and pursuing a solo career. In 1977, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He was supported by charity projects and financial contributions from friends, former bandmates and fans. After living with the disease for 21 years, he died in June 1997, aged 51.

For his work in both Small Faces and Faces, Lane was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.

He had two children, and two stepchildren who took his name.

== Early life ==
Lane was born in Plaistow Maternity Hospital, Plaistow, then a working-class area in Essex, to Elsie Lane and Stanley Lane, a lorry driver. Lane later described his father as a &quot;saint&quot; who would work a long workday and then return home to nurse his wife and two sons, all of whom were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) at different points in their lives. Doctors assured Lane as a child that the destructive disease was not necessarily inherited, although he found out later in his life that he had indeed inherited it.

After leaving school at the age of 16, Lane met Kenney Jones at a local pub, and they formed a group they named The Outcasts. Initially playing lead guitar, Lane quickly switched to bass. When shopping for a Harmony bass guitar, Lane visited the J60 Music Bar in Manor Park, London, where he met employee Steve Marriott. Lane bought his bass, and went to Marriott&#x27;s house after work, where Marriott introduced him to his Motown and Stax record collection. Lane and Marriott set out to form a band, recruiting friends Jimmy Winston, who switched from guitar to organ, and Jones. Marriott was chosen to be the frontman and singer.

== Career ==

=== Small Faces ===

The Small Faces consisted of Lane on bass guitar, Marriott as guitarist and lead vocalist, Jones as drummer, and Winston on keyboards. (The name &quot;Small&quot; was chosen as they were each no taller than 5&#x27; 6&quot; in height.) They made their debut in 1965, with Ian McLagan replacing Winston in November 1965. They had a successful chart career; Lane and Marriott wrote hit singles consistently, including &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot; and &quot;All or Nothing&quot;. He co-wrote all but one of the tracks on their 1968 concept album &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot;. The album stayed at number one on the UK Albums Chart for six weeks. When Marriott left the group in 1969, they disbanded.

=== Faces ===

Lane formed Faces with McLagan, Jones, Ronnie Wood and Rod Stewart in 1969. He shared composing or co-composing duties with Stewart, Wood, and McLagan. By 1972, with the band&#x27;s frontman Stewart focusing on his own solo career, Lane took a central role during the recording of their fourth and final album, &quot;Ooh La La&quot;. Unhappy due to poor reviews of the album and Stewart&#x27;s lack of commitment, Lane quit in 1973, making his last appearance on 4 June at the Sundown Theatre in Edmonton, London. He was replaced by Tetsu Yamauchi but tellingly the group made no further studio albums following Lane&#x27;s departure, and split in 1975. According to McLagan, Lane would later regret leaving Faces. &quot;Debris&quot; was one of his more famous vocalist songs.

=== Move to Wales ===
In 1973, Lane moved to Fishpool Farm in the village of Hyssington, Montgomeryshire, Wales, just over the border from England. In the late 1970s, already beginning to feel the effects of MS, he moved back to London.

=== Slim Chance and later career ===
After leaving the Faces, Lane formed his own band, Slim Chance, who recorded the singles &quot;How Come&quot; (UK No. 11) and &quot;The Poacher&quot; (UK No. 36) and the album &quot;Anymore for Anymore&quot;, showcasing a blend of British rock, folk and country music. The original line-up of this band included Scottish singer-songwriters Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle, who provided harmony vocals and played a variety of instruments including keyboards, accordion, acoustic guitar, mandolin, banjo and harmonica. They left in May 1974 to continue their career as a duo, though they would appear on 1977&#x27;s &quot;Rough Mix&quot; as guests.

After initial success he toured the UK with &quot;The Passing Show&quot;, a circus-type carnival complete with tents and barkers. Viv Stanshall, from the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, served briefly as ringmaster (of sorts). Gallagher &amp; Lyle were replaced with Scottish duo Lucas &amp; McCulloch who provided accordion, mandolin, guitars and banjo. They also acted as support act along with fiddle player Kenny Slaven who multi tracked all the string parts on &quot;The Poacher&quot;. Lane moved to Island Records and issued &quot;Ronnie Lane&#x27;s Slim Chance&quot; and &quot;One for the Road&quot;. In late 1976 he joined a short-lived reformation of Small Faces but quit after two rehearsals, to be replaced by Rick Wills (who later played alongside former Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones in the Jones Gang). However, Lane had signed a contract with Atlantic Records as part of the Small Faces and was informed that he owed the company an album. His ensuing album with Pete Townshend, &quot;Rough Mix&quot;, produced by Glyn Johns, which was released in 1977, was lauded as contender for best album of the year by many critics, but the label did not promote it and sales were lacklustre.

During the recording of &quot;Rough Mix&quot;, Lane&#x27;s multiple sclerosis was diagnosed. Nonetheless, he toured, wrote and recorded (with Eric Clapton among others) and in 1979 released another album, &quot;See Me&quot;, which features several songs written by Lane and Clapton. Around this time Lane travelled the highways and byways of England and lived a &#x27;passing show&#x27; modern nomadic life in full Gypsy traveller costume and accommodation.

In 1983, his girlfriend Boo Oldfield contacted Glyn Johns with a view to organising a concert to help fund Action for Research into Multiple Sclerosis. Johns was already arranging Clapton&#x27;s Command Performance for Prince Charles so they decided to book the Royal Albert Hall for a further two nights and host a benefit concert. The resulting ARMS Charity Concerts. featured Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, Ronnie Wood, Kenney Jones, Andy Fairweather Low, Steve Winwood, Ray Cooper, James Hooker, Fernando Saunders, Chris Stainton, Tony Hymas, Simon Phillips and others. With the addition of Joe Cocker and Paul Rodgers they toured the US.

== Later life and death ==
Lane emigrated to Texas in 1984 first to Houston and then Austin, where the climate was more beneficial to his health, where he continued playing, writing, and recording. He formed an American version of Slim Chance, which continued to be a loose-knit conglomeration of available musicians. For much of the time Alejandro Escovedo was a constant member. For close to a decade Lane enjoyed rock royalty status in the Austin area. He toured Japan but his health continued to decline. His last performance was in 1992 with Ronnie Wood and Ian McLagan.

In 1994 Lane and his wife Susan moved to the small town of Trinidad, Colorado. Jimmy Page, Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood funded his medical care as no royalties from the Small Faces work were forthcoming. Lane died from pneumonia during the final stages of multiple sclerosis. On 4 June 1997 he was buried in the Masonic Cemetery in Trinidad, Colorado. An album of live BBC recordings to raise money for his care was unreleased on his death.

== Tributes ==

Ride recorded &quot;A Trip Down Ronnie Lane&quot; as a B-side to their single &quot;Black Nite Crash&quot; in 1996. The Ocean Colour Scene song &quot;Travellers Tune&quot; on their 1997 studio album &quot;Marchin&#x27; Already&quot; was inspired by and written in the memory of Lane, a strong influence on the group, which appeared at the tribute concert for Ronnie Lane. Likewise Lane had been such a source of inspiration to the members of Poi Dog Pondering that they created a tribute page for him and in 1995 band member Susan Voelz covered Lane&#x27;s song, &quot;Glad and Sorry&quot; on her 1995 album, &quot;Summer Crashing&quot;, &quot;out of her respect and affection for Ronnie Lane&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poidogpondering/Lane&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Paul Weller recorded &quot;He&#x27;s the Keeper&quot;, a song dedicated to Lane&#x27;s memory. An album of live and in-studio recordings from Lane&#x27;s Austin days was later culled, and released as &quot;Live in Austin&quot;.

A street was named after him, &quot;Ronnie Lane&quot;, in Manor Park in 2001. In January 2006 BBC Four broadcast an extensive documentary about Lane, &quot;The Passing Show&quot; that had been in preparation since 2000 and included footage of vintage concerts by the Faces and Slim Chance. In October 2006 the documentary was also shown on BBC Two. In 2012, former Small Faces bandmate Ian MacLagan interpreted some of Lane&#x27;s best-known songs in a record entitled &quot;Spiritual Boy: In Appreciation of Ronnie Lane&quot;. McLagan died in 2014.

Longtime collaborator Charlie Hart compiled a six-CD set of Lane&#x27;s compositions, after his death, that included many unreleased songs.

<text>The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (DANFS) is the official reference work for the basic facts about ships used by the United States Navy.

When the writing project was developed the parameters for this series were designed to cover only commissioned US Navy ships with assigned names. If the ship was not assigned a name it was not included in the histories written for the series.
In addition to the ship entries, &quot;DANFS&quot; and the online links have been expanded to include appendices on small craft, histories of Confederate Navy ships, and various essays related to naval ships.

==Forewords and introductions==
Foreword and introduction passages for many editions were written by s from naval command history from Arleigh Albert Burke to Elmo Russell Zumwalt, Jr. and others.

==Authors==
==Publication data==
&quot;DANFS&quot; was published in print by the Naval Historical Center (NHC) as bound hardcover volumes, ordered by ship name, from Volume I (A–B) in 1959 to Volume VIII (W–Z) in 1981. Several volumes subsequently went out of print. In 1991 a revised &quot;Volume I Part A&quot;, covering only ship names beginning with A, was released. Work continues on revisions of the remaining volumes.

Volunteers at the Hazegray website undertook to transcribe the &quot;DANFS&quot; and make it available on the World Wide Web. The project goal is a direct transcription of the &quot;DANFS&quot;, with
changes limited to correcting typographical errors and editorial notes for incorrect facts in the original.
In 2008 the NHC was re-designated as the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC). It has developed an online version of &quot;DANFS&quot; (see External links section below) through a combination of optical character recognition (OCR) and hand transcription. The NHHC is slowly updating its online &quot;DANFS&quot; to correct errors and take into account the gap in time between the print publication and the present date. NHHC prioritizes updates as follows: ships currently commissioned, ships commissioned after the original volume publication, ships decommissioned after original volume publication, and finally updates to older ships. The NHHC has begun a related project to place Ship History and Command Operations Reports online at their site.

==Reference use==

As the &quot;DANFS&quot; is a work of the U.S. government, its content is in the public domain, and the text is often quoted verbatim in other works. Many websites organized by former and active crew members of U.S. Navy vessels include a copy of their ships&#x27; &quot;DANFS&quot; entries.

The &quot;Dictionary&quot; limits itself largely to basic descriptions and brief operational notes, and includes almost no analysis or historical context.

<doc id="188540" wikidata="Q212737" url="?curid=188540" title="Classical conditioning">
<text>Classical conditioning (also respondent conditioning and Pavlonian conditioning) is a behavioral procedure in which a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food, a puff of air on the eye, a potential rival) is paired with a neutral stimulus (e.g. the sound of a musical triangle). The term &quot;classical conditioning&quot; refers to the process of an automatic, conditioned response that is paired with a specific stimulus.

The Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov studied classical conditioning with detailed experiments with dogs, and published the experimental results in 1897. In the study of digestion, Pavlov observed that the experimental dogs salivated when fed red meat. Pavlovian conditioning is distinct from operant conditioning (instrumental conditioning), through which the strength of a voluntary behavior is modified, either by reinforcement or by punishment. However, classical conditioning can affect operant conditioning; classically conditioned stimuli can reinforce operant responses.

Classical conditioning is a basic behavioral mechanism, and its neural substrates are now beginning to be understood. Though it is sometimes hard to distinguish classical conditioning from other forms of associative learning (e.g. instrumental learning and human associative memory), a number of observations differentiate them, especially the contingencies whereby learning occurs.

Together with operant conditioning, classical conditioning became the foundation of behaviorism, a school of psychology which was dominant in the mid-20th century and is still an important influence on the practice of psychological therapy and the study of animal behavior. Classical conditioning has been applied in other areas as well. For example, it may affect the body&#x27;s response to psychoactive drugs, the regulation of hunger, research on the neural basis of learning and memory, and in certain social phenomena such as the false consensus effect.

==Definition==
Classical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US). Usually, the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus (e.g., the sound of a tuning fork), the unconditioned stimulus is biologically potent (e.g., the taste of food) and the unconditioned response (UR) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned reflex response (e.g., salivation). After pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response (CR) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone. (A conditioned response may occur after only one pairing.) Thus, unlike the UR, the CR is acquired through experience, and it is also less permanent than the UR.

Usually the conditioned response is similar to the unconditioned response, but sometimes it is quite different. For this and other reasons, most learning theorists suggest that the conditioned stimulus comes to signal or predict the unconditioned stimulus, and go on to analyse the consequences of this signal. Robert A. Rescorla provided a clear summary of this change in thinking, and its implications, in his 1988 article &quot;Pavlovian conditioning: It&#x27;s not what you think it is&quot;. Despite its widespread acceptance, Rescorla&#x27;s thesis may not be defensible.

Classical conditioning differs from &quot;operant&quot; or &quot;instrumental&quot; conditioning: in classical conditioning, behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above, whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce (i.e., reward or punishment).

==Procedures==
===Pavlov&#x27;s research===
The best-known and most thorough early work on classical conditioning was done by Ivan Pavlov, although Edwin Twitmyer published some related findings a year earlier. During his research on the physiology of digestion in dogs, Pavlov developed a procedure that enabled him to study the digestive processes of animals over long periods of time. He redirected the animals&#x27; digestive fluids outside the body, where they could be measured.

Pavlov noticed that his dogs began to salivate in the presence of the technician who normally fed them, rather than simply salivating in the presence of food. Pavlov called the dogs&#x27; anticipatory salivation &quot;psychic secretion&quot;. Putting these informal observations to an experimental test, Pavlov presented a stimulus (e.g. the sound of a metronome) and then gave the dog food; after a few repetitions, the dogs started to salivate in response to the stimulus. Pavlov concluded that if a particular stimulus in the dog&#x27;s surroundings was present when the dog was given food then that stimulus could become associated with food and cause salivation on its own.

===Terminology===
In Pavlov&#x27;s experiments the &quot;unconditioned stimulus (US)&quot; was the food because its effects did not depend on previous experience. The metronome&#x27;s sound is originally a &quot;neutral stimulus (NS)&quot; because it does not elicit salivation in the dogs. After conditioning, the metronome&#x27;s sound becomes the &quot;conditioned stimulus (CS)&quot; or conditional stimulus; because its effects depend on its association with food. Likewise, the responses of the dog follow the same conditioned-versus-unconditioned arrangement. The &quot;conditioned response (CR)&quot; is the response to the conditioned stimulus, whereas the &quot;unconditioned response (UR)&quot; corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus.

Pavlov reported many basic facts about conditioning; for example, he found that learning occurred most rapidly when the interval between the CS and the appearance of the US was relatively short.

As noted earlier, it is often thought that the conditioned response is a replica of the unconditioned response, but Pavlov noted that saliva produced by the CS differs in composition from that produced by the US. In fact, the CR may be any new response to the previously neutral CS that can be clearly linked to experience with the conditional relationship of CS and US. It was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge, but many CRs can be learned with a single trial, especially in fear conditioning and taste aversion learning.

===Forward conditioning===
Learning is fastest in forward conditioning. During forward conditioning, the onset of the CS precedes the onset of the US in order to signal that the US will follow. Two common forms of forward conditioning are delay and trace conditioning.

* Delay conditioning: In delay conditioning, the CS is presented and is overlapped by the presentation of the US. For example, if a person hears a buzzer for five seconds, during which time air is puffed into their eye, the person will blink. After several pairings of the buzzer and the puff, the person will blink at the sound of the buzzer alone. This is delay conditioning.
* Trace conditioning: During trace conditioning, the CS and US do not overlap. Instead, the CS begins and ends before the US is presented. The stimulus-free period is called the &quot;trace interval&quot; or the &quot;conditioning interval&quot;. If in the above buzzer example, the puff came a second after the sound of the buzzer stopped, that would be trace conditioning, with a trace or conditioning interval of one second.
===Simultaneous conditioning===
During simultaneous conditioning, the CS and US are presented and terminated at the same time. For example: If a person hears a bell and has air puffed into their eye at the same time, and repeated pairings like this led to the person blinking when they hear the bell despite the puff of air being absent, this demonstrates that simultaneous conditioning has occurred.

===Second-order and higher-order conditioning===

Second-order or higher-order conditioning follow a two-step procedure. First a neutral stimulus (&quot;CS1&quot;) comes to signal a US through forward conditioning. Then a second neutral stimulus (&quot;CS2&quot;) is paired with the first (CS1) and comes to yield its own conditioned response. For example: A bell might be paired with food until the bell elicits salivation. If a light is then paired with the bell, then the light may come to elicit salivation as well. The bell is the CS1 and the food is the US. The light becomes the CS2 once it is paired with the CS1.

===Backward conditioning===
Backward conditioning occurs when a CS immediately follows a US. Unlike the usual conditioning procedure, in which the CS precedes the US, the conditioned response given to the CS tends to be inhibitory. This presumably happens because the CS serves as a signal that the US has ended, rather than as a signal that the US is about to appear. For example, a puff of air directed at a person&#x27;s eye could be followed by the sound of a buzzer.

===Temporal conditioning===
In temporal conditioning, a US is presented at regular intervals, for instance every 10 minutes. Conditioning is said to have occurred when the CR tends to occur shortly before each US. This suggests that animals have a biological clock that can serve as a CS. This method has also been used to study timing ability in animals (see Animal cognition).

The example below shows the temporal conditioning, as US such as food to a hungry mouse is simply delivered on a regular time schedule such as every thirty seconds. After sufficient exposure the mouse will begin to salivate just before the food delivery. This then makes it temporal conditioning as it would appear that the mouse is conditioned to the passage of time.
===Zero contingency procedure===
In this procedure, the CS is paired with the US, but the US also occurs at other times. If this occurs, it is predicted that the US is likely to happen in the absence of the CS. In other words, the CS does not &quot;predict&quot; the US. In this case, conditioning fails and the CS does not come to elicit a CR. This finding – that &quot;prediction&quot; rather than CS-US pairing is the key to conditioning – greatly influenced subsequent conditioning research and theory.

===Extinction===

In the extinction procedure, the CS is presented repeatedly in the absence of a US. This is done after a CS has been conditioned by one of the methods above. When this is done, the CR frequency eventually returns to pre-training levels. However, extinction does not eliminate the effects of the prior conditioning. This is demonstrated by spontaneous recovery – when there is a sudden appearance of the (CR) after extinction occurs – and other related phenomena (see &quot;Recovery from extinction&quot; below). These phenomena can be explained by postulating accumulation of inhibition when a weak stimulus is presented.

==Phenomena observed==

===Acquisition===
During acquisition, the CS and US are paired as described above. The extent of conditioning may be tracked by test trials. In these test trials, the CS is presented alone and the CR is measured. A single CS-US pairing may suffice to yield a CR on a test, but usually a number of pairings are necessary and there is a gradual increase in the conditioned response to the CS. This repeated number of trials increase the strength and/or frequency of the CR gradually. The speed of conditioning depends on a number of factors, such as the nature and strength of both the CS and the US, previous experience and the animal&#x27;s motivational state. The process slows down as it nears completion.

===Extinction===
If the CS is presented without the US, and this process is repeated often enough, the CS will eventually stop eliciting a CR. At this point the CR is said to be &quot;extinguished.&quot;

===External inhibition===
External inhibition may be observed if a strong or unfamiliar stimulus is presented just before, or at the same time as, the CS. This causes a reduction in the conditioned response to the CS.

===Recovery from extinction===
Several procedures lead to the recovery of a CR that had been first conditioned and then extinguished. This illustrates that the extinction procedure does not eliminate the effect of conditioning. These procedures are the following:
* Reacquisition: If the CS is again paired with the US, a CR is again acquired, but this second acquisition usually happens much faster than the first one.
* Spontaneous recovery: Spontaneous recovery is defined as the reappearance of a previously extinguished conditioned response after a rest period. That is, if the CS is tested at a later time (for example an hour or a day) after extinction it will again elicit a CR. This renewed CR is usually much weaker than the CR observed prior to extinction.
* Disinhibition: If the CS is tested just after extinction and an intense but associatively neutral stimulus has occurred, there may be a temporary recovery of the conditioned response to the CS.
* Reinstatement: If the US used in conditioning is presented to a subject in the same place where conditioning and extinction occurred, but without the CS being present, the CS often elicits a response when it is tested later.
* Renewal: Renewal is a reemergence of a conditioned response following extinction when an animal is returned to the environment (or similar environment) in which the conditioned response was acquired.

===Stimulus generalization===
&quot;Stimulus generalization&quot; is said to occur if, after a particular CS has come to elicit a CR, a similar test stimulus is found to elicit the same CR. Usually the more similar the test stimulus is to the CS the stronger the CR will be to the test stimulus. Conversely, the more the test stimulus differs from the CS, the weaker the CR will be, or the more it will differ from that previously observed.

===Stimulus discrimination===
One observes &quot;stimulus discrimination&quot; when one stimulus (&quot;CS1&quot;) elicits one CR and another stimulus (&quot;CS2&quot;) elicits either another CR or no CR at all. This can be brought about by, for example, pairing CS1 with an effective US and presenting CS2 with no US.

===Latent inhibition===

Latent inhibition refers to the observation that it takes longer for a familiar stimulus to become a CS than it does for a novel stimulus to become a CS, when the stimulus is paired with an effective US.

===Conditioned suppression===
This is one of the most common ways to measure the strength of learning in classical conditioning. A typical example of this procedure is as follows: a rat first learns to press a lever through operant conditioning. Then, in a series of trials, the rat is exposed to a CS, a light or a noise, followed by the US, a mild electric shock. An association between the CS and US develops, and the rat slows or stops its lever pressing when the CS comes on. The rate of pressing during the CS measures the strength of classical conditioning; that is, the slower the rat presses, the stronger the association of the CS and the US. (Slow pressing indicates a &quot;fear&quot; conditioned response, and it is an example of a conditioned emotional response; see section below.)

===Conditioned inhibition===
Typically, three phases of conditioning are used.

====Phase 1====
A CS (CS+) is paired with a US until asymptotic CR levels are reached.

====Phase 2====
CS+/US trials are continued, but these are interspersed with trials on which the CS+ is paired with a second CS, (the CS-) but not with the US (i.e. CS+/CS- trials). Typically, organisms show CRs on CS+/US trials, but stop responding on CS+/CS− trials.

====Phase 3====
* &quot;Summation test for conditioned inhibition:&quot; The CS- from phase 2 is presented together with a new CS+ that was conditioned as in phase 1. Conditioned inhibition is found if the response is less to the CS+/CS- pair than it is to the CS+ alone.
* &quot;Retardation test for conditioned inhibition:&quot; The CS- from phase 2 is paired with the US. If conditioned inhibition has occurred, the rate of acquisition to the previous CS− should be less than the rate of acquisition that would be found without the phase 2 treatment.

===Blocking===

This form of classical conditioning involves two phases.

====Phase 1====
A CS (CS1) is paired with a US.

====Phase 2====
A compound CS (CS1+CS2) is paired with a US.

====Test====
A separate test for each CS (CS1 and CS2) is performed. The blocking effect is observed in a lack of conditional response to CS2, suggesting that the first phase of training blocked the acquisition of the second CS.
==Theories==

===Data sources===

Experiments on theoretical issues in conditioning have mostly been done on vertebrates, especially rats and pigeons. However, conditioning has also been studied in invertebrates, and very important data on the neural basis of conditioning has come from experiments on the sea slug, &quot;Aplysia&quot;. Most relevant experiments have used the classical conditioning procedure, although instrumental (operant) conditioning experiments have also been used, and the strength of classical conditioning is often measured through its operant effects, as in &quot;conditioned suppression&quot; (see Phenomena section above) and autoshaping.

===Stimulus-substitution theory===

According to Pavlov, conditioning does not involve the acquisition of any new behavior, but rather the tendency to respond in old ways to new stimuli. Thus, he theorized that the CS merely substitutes for the US in evoking the reflex response. This explanation is called the stimulus-substitution theory of conditioning. A critical problem with the stimulus-substitution theory is that the CR and UR are not always the same. Pavlov himself observed that a dog&#x27;s saliva produced as a CR differed in composition from that produced as a UR. The CR is sometimes even the opposite of the UR. For example: the unconditional response to electric shock is an increase in heart rate, whereas a CS that has been paired with the electric shock elicits a decrease in heart rate. (However, it has been proposed that only when the UR does not involve the central nervous system are the CR and the UR opposites.)

===Rescorla–Wagner model===
The Rescorla–Wagner (R–W) model is a relatively simple yet powerful model of conditioning. The model predicts a number of important phenomena, but it also fails in important ways, thus leading to a number of modifications and alternative models. However, because much of the theoretical research on conditioning in the past 40 years has been instigated by this model or reactions to it, the R–W model deserves a brief description here.

The Rescorla-Wagner model argues that there is a limit to the amount of conditioning that can occur in the pairing of two stimuli. One determinant of this limit is the nature of the US. For example: pairing a bell with a juicy steak is more likely to produce salivation than pairing the bell with a piece of dry bread, and dry bread is likely to work better than a piece of cardboard. A key idea behind the R–W model is that a CS signals or predicts the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US. However, after conditioning, the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. (The model can be described mathematically and that words like predict, surprise, and expect are only used to help explain the model.) Here the workings of the model are illustrated with brief accounts of acquisition, extinction, and blocking. The model also predicts a number of other phenomena, see main article on the model.

====Equation====
formula_1

This is the Rescorla-Wagner equation. It specifies the amount of learning that will occur on a single pairing of a conditioning stimulus (CS) with an unconditioned stimulus (US). The above equation is solved repeatedly to predict the course of learning over many such trials.

In this model, the degree of learning is measured by how well the CS predicts the US, which is given by the &quot;associative strength&quot; of the CS. In the equation, V represents the current associative strength of the CS, and ∆V is the change in this strength that happens on a given trial. ΣV is the sum of the strengths of all stimuli present in the situation. λ is the maximum associative strength that a given US will support; its value is usually set to 1 on trials when the US is present, and 0 when the US is absent. α and β are constants related to the salience of the CS and the speed of learning for a given US. How the equation predicts various experimental results is explained in following sections. For further details, see the main article on the model.

====R–W model: acquisition====
The R–W model measures conditioning by assigning an &quot;associative strength&quot; to the CS and other local stimuli. Before a CS is conditioned it has an associative strength of zero. Pairing the CS and the US causes a gradual increase in the associative strength of the CS. This increase is determined by the nature of the US (e.g. its intensity). The amount of learning that happens during any single CS-US pairing depends on the difference between the total associative strengths of CS and other stimuli present in the situation (ΣV in the equation), and a maximum set by the US (λ in the equation). On the first pairing of the CS and US, this difference is large and the associative strength of the CS takes a big step up. As CS-US pairings accumulate, the US becomes more predictable, and the increase in associative strength on each trial becomes smaller and smaller. Finally, the difference between the associative strength of the CS (plus any that may accrue to other stimuli) and the maximum strength reaches zero. That is, the US is fully predicted, the associative strength of the CS stops growing, and conditioning is complete.

====R–W model: extinction====

The associative process described by the R–W model also accounts for extinction (see &quot;procedures&quot; above). The extinction procedure starts with a positive associative strength of the CS, which means that the CS predicts that the US will occur. On an extinction trial the US fails to occur after the CS. As a result of this &quot;surprising&quot; outcome, the associative strength of the CS takes a step down. Extinction is complete when the strength of the CS reaches zero; no US is predicted, and no US occurs. However, if that same CS is presented without the US but accompanied by a well-established conditioned inhibitor (CI), that is, a stimulus that predicts the absence of a US (in R-W terms, a stimulus with a negative associate strength) then R-W predicts that the CS will not undergo extinction (its V will not decrease in size).

====R–W model: blocking====

The most important and novel contribution of the R–W model is its assumption that the conditioning of a CS depends not just on that CS alone, and its relationship to the US, but also on all other stimuli present in the conditioning situation. In particular, the model states that the US is predicted by the sum of the associative strengths of all stimuli present in the conditioning situation. Learning is controlled by the difference between this total associative strength and the strength supported by the US. When this sum of strengths reaches a maximum set by the US, conditioning ends as just described.

The R–W explanation of the blocking phenomenon illustrates one consequence of the assumption just stated. In blocking (see &quot;phenomena&quot; above), CS1 is paired with a US until conditioning is complete. Then on additional conditioning trials a second stimulus (CS2) appears together with CS1, and both are followed by the US. Finally CS2 is tested and shown to produce no response because learning about CS2 was &quot;blocked&quot; by the initial learning about CS1. The R–W model explains this by saying that after the initial conditioning, CS1 fully predicts the US. Since there is no difference between what is predicted and what happens, no new learning happens on the additional trials with CS1+CS2, hence CS2 later yields no response.

===Theoretical issues and alternatives to the Rescorla–Wagner model===
One of the main reasons for the importance of the R–W model is that it is relatively simple and makes clear predictions. Tests of these predictions have led to a number of important new findings and a considerably increased understanding of conditioning. Some new information has supported the theory, but much has not, and it is generally agreed that the theory is, at best, too simple. However, no single model seems to account for all the phenomena that experiments have produced. Following are brief summaries of some related theoretical issues.

====Content of learning====
The R–W model reduces conditioning to the association of a CS and US, and measures this with a single number, the associative strength of the CS. A number of experimental findings indicate that more is learned than this. Among these are two phenomena described earlier in this article
* Latent inhibition: If a subject is repeatedly exposed to the CS before conditioning starts, then conditioning takes longer. The R–W model cannot explain this because preexposure leaves the strength of the CS unchanged at zero.
* Recovery of responding after extinction: It appears that something remains after extinction has reduced associative strength to zero because several procedures cause responding to reappear without further conditioning.

====Role of attention in learning====
Latent inhibition might happen because a subject stops focusing on a CS that is seen frequently before it is paired with a US. In fact, changes in attention to the CS are at the heart of two prominent theories that try to cope with experimental results that give the R–W model difficulty. In one of these, proposed by Nicholas Mackintosh, the speed of conditioning depends on the amount of attention devoted to the CS, and this amount of attention depends in turn on how well the CS predicts the US. Pearce and Hall proposed a related model based on a different attentional principle Both models have been extensively tested, and neither explains all the experimental results. Consequently, various authors have attempted hybrid models that combine the two attentional processes. Pearce and Hall in 2010 integrated their attentional ideas and even suggested the possibility of incorporating the Rescorla-Wagner equation into an integrated model.

====Context====
As stated earlier, a key idea in conditioning is that the CS signals or predicts the US (see &quot;zero contingency procedure&quot; above). However, for example, the room in which conditioning takes place also &quot;predicts&quot; that the US may occur. Still, the room predicts with much less certainty than does the experimental CS itself, because the room is also there between experimental trials, when the US is absent. The role of such context is illustrated by the fact that the dogs in Pavlov&#x27;s experiment would sometimes start salivating as they approached the experimental apparatus, before they saw or heard any CS. Such so-called &quot;context&quot; stimuli are always present, and their influence helps to account for some otherwise puzzling experimental findings. The associative strength of context stimuli can be entered into the Rescorla-Wagner equation, and they play an important role in the &quot;comparator&quot; and &quot;computational&quot; theories outlined below.

====Comparator theory====
To find out what has been learned, we must somehow measure behavior (&quot;performance&quot;) in a test situation. However, as students know all too well, performance in a test situation is not always a good measure of what has been learned. As for conditioning, there is evidence that subjects in a blocking experiment do learn something about the &quot;blocked&quot; CS, but fail to show this learning because of the way that they are usually tested.

&quot;Comparator&quot; theories of conditioning are &quot;performance based&quot;, that is, they stress what is going on at the time of the test. In particular, they look at all the stimuli that are present during testing and at how the associations acquired by these stimuli may interact. To oversimplify somewhat, comparator theories assume that during conditioning the subject acquires both CS-US and context-US associations. At the time of the test, these associations are compared, and a response to the CS occurs only if the CS-US association is stronger than the context-US association. After a CS and US are repeatedly paired in simple acquisition, the CS-US association is strong and the context-US association is relatively weak. This means that the CS elicits a strong CR. In &quot;zero contingency&quot; (see above), the conditioned response is weak or absent because the context-US association is about as strong as the CS-US association. Blocking and other more subtle phenomena can also be explained by comparator theories, though, again, they cannot explain everything.

====Computational theory====
An organism&#x27;s need to predict future events is central to modern theories of conditioning. Most theories use associations between stimuli to take care of these predictions. For example: In the R–W model, the associative strength of a CS tells us how strongly that CS predicts a US. A different approach to prediction is suggested by models such as that proposed by Gallistel &amp; Gibbon (2000, 2002). Here the response is not determined by associative strengths. Instead, the organism records the times of onset and offset of CSs and USs and uses these to calculate the probability that the US will follow the CS. A number of experiments have shown that humans and animals can learn to time events (see Animal cognition), and the Gallistel &amp; Gibbon model yields very good quantitative fits to a variety of experimental data. However, recent studies have suggested that duration-based models cannot account for some empirical findings as well as associative models.

====Element-based models====
The Rescorla-Wagner model treats a stimulus as a single entity, and it represents the associative strength of a stimulus with one number, with no record of how that number was reached. As noted above, this makes it hard for the model to account for a number of experimental results. More flexibility is provided by assuming that a stimulus is internally represented by a collection of elements, each of which may change from one associative state to another. For example, the similarity of one stimulus to another may be represented by saying that the two stimuli share elements in common. These shared elements help to account for stimulus generalization and other phenomena that may depend upon generalization. Also, different elements within the same set may have different associations, and their activations and associations may change at different times and at different rates. This allows element-based models to handle some otherwise inexplicable results.

=====The SOP model=====
A prominent example of the element approach is the &quot;SOP&quot; model of Wagner. The model has been elaborated in various ways since its introduction, and it can now account in principle for a very wide variety of experimental findings. The model represents any given stimulus with a large collection of elements. The time of presentation of various stimuli, the state of their elements, and the interactions between the elements, all determine the course of associative processes and the behaviors observed during conditioning experiments.

The SOP account of simple conditioning exemplifies some essentials of the SOP model. To begin with, the model assumes that the CS and US are each represented by a large group of elements. Each of these stimulus elements can be in one of three states: 
* primary activity (A1) - Roughly speaking, the stimulus is &quot;attended to.&quot; (References to &quot;attention&quot; are intended only to aid understanding and are not part of the model.)
* secondary activity (A2) - The stimulus is &quot;peripherally attended to.&quot;
* inactive (I) – The stimulus is &quot;not attended to.&quot;
Of the elements that represent a single stimulus at a given moment, some may be in state A1, some in state A2, and some in state I.

When a stimulus first appears, some of its elements jump from inactivity I to primary activity A1. From the A1 state they gradually decay to A2, and finally back to I. Element activity can only change in this way; in particular, elements in A2 cannot go directly back to A1. If the elements of both the CS and the US are in the A1 state at the same time, an association is learned between the two stimuli. This means that if, at a later time, the CS is presented ahead of the US, and some CS elements enter A1, these elements will activate some US elements. However, US elements activated indirectly in this way only get boosted to the A2 state. (This can be thought of the CS arousing a memory of the US, which will not be as strong as the real thing.) With repeated CS-US trials, more and more elements are associated, and more and more US elements go to A2 when the CS comes on. This gradually leaves fewer and fewer US elements that can enter A1 when the US itself appears. In consequence, learning slows down and approaches a limit. One might say that the US is &quot;fully predicted&quot; or &quot;not surprising&quot; because almost all of its elements can only enter A2 when the CS comes on, leaving few to form new associations.

The model can explain the findings that are accounted for by the Rescorla-Wagner model and a number of additional findings as well. For example, unlike most other models, SOP takes time into account. The rise and decay of element activation enables the model to explain time-dependent effects such as the fact that conditioning is strongest when the CS comes just before the US, and that when the CS comes after the US (&quot;backward conditioning&quot;) the result is often an inhibitory CS. Many other more subtle phenomena are explained as well.

A number of other powerful models have appeared in recent years which incorporate element representations. These often include the assumption that associations involve a network of connections between &quot;nodes&quot; that represent stimuli, responses, and perhaps one or more &quot;hidden&quot; layers of intermediate interconnections. Such models make contact with a current explosion of research on neural networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

==Applications==

===Neural basis of learning and memory===

Pavlov proposed that conditioning involved a connection between brain centers for conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. His physiological account of conditioning has been abandoned, but classical conditioning continues to be used to study the neural structures and functions that underlie learning and memory. Forms of classical conditioning that are used for this purpose include, among others, fear conditioning, eyeblink conditioning, and the foot contraction conditioning of &quot;Hermissenda crassicornis&quot;, a sea-slug. Both fear and eyeblink conditioning involve a neutral stimulus, frequently a tone, becoming paired with an unconditioned stimulus. In the case of eyeblink conditioning, the US is an air-puff, while in fear conditioning the US is threatening or aversive such as a foot shock.

The American neuroscientist David A. McCormick performed experiments that demonstrated &quot;...discrete regions of the cerebellum and associated brainstem areas contain neurons that alter their activity during conditioning – these regions are critical for the acquisition and performance of this simple learning task. It appears that other regions of the brain, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, contribute to the conditioning process, especially when the demands of the task get more complex.&quot;

Fear and eyeblink conditioning involve generally non overlapping neural circuitry, but share molecular mechanisms. Fear conditioning occurs in the basolateral amygdala, which receives glutaminergic input directly from thalamic afferents, as well as indirectly from prefrontal projections. The direct projections are sufficient for delay conditioning, but in the case of trace conditioning, where the CS needs to be internally represented despite a lack of external stimulus, indirect pathways are necessary. The anterior cingulate is one candidate for intermediate trace conditioning, but the hippocampus may also play a major role. Presynaptic activation of protein kinase A and postsynaptic activation of NMDA receptors and its signal transduction pathway are necessary for conditioning related plasticity. CREB is also necessary for conditioning related plasticity, and it may induce downstream synthesis of proteins necessary for this to occur. As NMDA receptors are only activated after an increase in presynaptic calcium(thereby releasing the Mg2+ block), they are a potential coincidence detector that could mediate spike timing dependent plasticity. STDP constrains LTP to situations where the CS predicts the US, and LTD to the reverse.

===Behavioral therapies===

Some therapies associated with classical conditioning are aversion therapy, systematic desensitization and flooding.

Aversion therapy is a type of behavior therapy designed to make patients cease an undesirable habit by associating the habit with a strong unpleasant unconditioned stimulus. For example, a medication might be used to associate the taste of alcohol with stomach upset. Systematic desensitization is a treatment for phobias in which the patient is trained to relax while being exposed to progressively more anxiety-provoking stimuli (e.g. angry words). This is an example of counterconditioning, intended to associate the feared stimuli with a response (relaxation) that is incompatible with anxiety Flooding is a form of desensitization that attempts to eliminate phobias and anxieties by repeated exposure to highly distressing stimuli until the lack of reinforcement of the anxiety response causes its extinction. &quot;Flooding&quot; usually involves actual exposure to the stimuli, whereas the term &quot;implosion&quot; refers to imagined exposure, but the two terms are sometimes used synonymously.

Conditioning therapies usually take less time than humanistic therapies.

===Conditioned drug response===
A stimulus that is present when a drug is administered or consumed may eventually evoke a conditioned physiological response that mimics the effect of the drug. This is sometimes the case with caffeine; habitual coffee drinkers may find that the smell of coffee gives them a feeling of alertness. In other cases, the conditioned response is a compensatory reaction that tends to offset the effects of the drug. For example, if a drug causes the body to become less sensitive to pain, the compensatory conditioned reaction may be one that makes the user more sensitive to pain. This compensatory reaction may contribute to drug tolerance. If so, a drug user may increase the amount of drug consumed in order to feel its effects, and end up taking very large amounts of the drug. In this case a dangerous overdose reaction may occur if the CS happens to be absent, so that the conditioned compensatory effect fails to occur. For example, if the drug has always been administered in the same room, the stimuli provided by that room may produce a conditioned compensatory effect; then an overdose reaction may happen if the drug is administered in a different location where the conditioned stimuli are absent.

===Conditioned hunger===
Signals that consistently precede food intake can become conditioned stimuli for a set of bodily responses that prepares the body for food and digestion. These reflexive responses include the secretion of digestive juices into the stomach and the secretion of certain hormones into the blood stream, and they induce a state of hunger. An example of conditioned hunger is the &quot;appetizer effect.&quot; Any signal that consistently precedes a meal, such as a clock indicating that it is time for dinner, can cause people to feel hungrier than before the signal. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is involved in the initiation of eating. The nigrostriatal pathway, which includes the substantia nigra, the lateral hypothalamus, and the basal ganglia have been shown to be involved in hunger motivation.

===Conditioned emotional response===

The influence of classical conditioning can be seen in emotional responses such as phobia, disgust, nausea, anger, and sexual arousal. A common example is conditioned nausea, in which the CS is the sight or smell of a particular food that in the past has resulted in an unconditioned stomach upset. Similarly, when the CS is the sight of a dog and the US is the pain of being bitten, the result may be a conditioned fear of dogs. An example of conditioned emotional response is conditioned suppression.

As an adaptive mechanism, emotional conditioning helps shield an individual from harm or prepare it for important biological events such as sexual activity. Thus, a stimulus that has occurred before sexual interaction comes to cause sexual arousal, which prepares the individual for sexual contact. For example, sexual arousal has been conditioned in human subjects by pairing a stimulus like a picture of a jar of pennies with views of an erotic film clip. Similar experiments involving blue gourami fish and domesticated quail have shown that such conditioning can increase the number of offspring. These results suggest that conditioning techniques might help to increase fertility rates in infertile individuals and endangered species.

===Pavlovian-instrumental transfer===
Pavlovian-instrumental transfer is a phenomenon that occurs when a conditioned stimulus (CS, also known as a &quot;cue&quot;) that has been associated with rewarding or aversive stimuli via classical conditioning alters motivational salience and operant behavior. In a typical experiment, a rat is presented with sound-food pairings (classical conditioning). Separately, the rat learns to press a lever to get food (operant conditioning). Test sessions now show that the rat presses the lever faster in the presence of the sound than in silence, although the sound has never been associated with lever pressing.

Pavlovian-instrumental transfer is suggested to play a role in the differential outcomes effect, a procedure which enhances operant discrimination by pairing stimuli with specific outcomes.

<text>Brecqhou (or Brechou; ) is one of the Channel Islands, located off the west coast of Sark where they are now geographically detached from each other. Brecqhou is politically part of both Sark and the Bailiwick of Guernsey. It has been established in the courts that Brecqhou is a of Sark. The Ministry of Justice, the department of the United Kingdom government with responsibility for the Channel Islands, considers Brecqhou part of Sark.

==Name==

The name &quot;Brecqhou&quot; derives from the Old Norse (slope or escarpment; compare ) and (island or islet; see &quot;-hou&quot;). It was also formerly known as &quot;Merchant&#x27;s Island&quot; (). The spellings &quot;Brechou&quot;, &quot;Brehou&quot;, &quot;Brehoe&quot; appear on old maps.

==Geography==
A mere islet, Brecqhou has a surface area of just . The island is separated from Sark by an extremely narrow sound ( Passage) which can be perilous for rowers. It is traversed frequently by yachts during summer and by fishing boats year round and even forms a part of the route taken by occasional powerboating events in the islands.
==Feudal relationship with Sark==
In Sark, the word &quot;tenant&quot; is used, and often pronounced as in French, in the sense of &quot;feudal landholder&quot; rather than the common English meaning of &quot;lessee&quot;. The landholdings of Sark are held by 40 &quot;tenants&quot; representing the parcels of the 40 families who colonised Sark. As explained on the Sark government website: &quot;There is no true freehold, all land being held on perpetual lease (fief) from the Seigneur, and the 40 properties (Tenements) into which the Island is divided (as well as a few other holdings in perpetual fief) can only pass by strict rules of inheritance or by sale.&quot; The relevance of the seigneurial privileges and duties that distinguish &quot;feudal&quot; from &quot;civil&quot; landowning has decreased as most of the duties relate to agriculture and defence.

Since 1929, the island has been connected to the title of the tenement &#x27;, one of the 40 tenements whose owner had to keep a gun for the defence of the fief and, until forfeit in 2008, had a seat in the Chief Pleas. Originally, &#x27;, named after the medieval monastery whose site is close to it, was a parcel of land in northwest Sark that was, at that time, owned by the Seigneur himself. When Sibyl Hathaway sold the island of Brecqhou to Angelo Clarke in 1929, she transferred that seat in the Chief Pleas to unrepresented Brecqhou. This was scant loss for her, as she owned more than one tenement and every member of the Chief Pleas was entitled to only one vote.

From 1993, the tenement of Brecqhou was owned by the Barclay brothers, the co-owners of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper and former co-owners of &quot;The Scotsman&quot;. The brothers bought the island for £2.3 million in September 1993. Under the Reform (Sark) Law 1951, the tenant was David Barclay. After assuming ownership, the brothers had intermittent legal disputes with the government of Sark, and expressed a desire to make Brecqhou politically independent. They drove cars on the island and had a helicopter, both of which are banned under Sark law.

* Customary and express written rule of Sark over Brecqhou may be evidenced in the retention of all seigneurial rights per the sale instrument from the Dame (female Seigneur) of Sark, Hathaway, to Clarke in 1929. 
* According to the Barclays this retention was invalid, as Brecqhou may not have been part of the fief of Sark. They cited facts such as that the letters patent establishing the fief do not mention the smaller island. While the Seigneur in long succession came to own Brecqhou (not before 1681), they cited practices and acts to suggest Brecqhou may not have been merged into the fief of Sark. Therefore the claim runs that the Seigneur could not legally hold the privileges valid elsewhere such as might survive sale, whatever its terms.

This conflict caused a lawsuit (1996–2000) and the founding in 2006 of a Brecqhou liaison sub-committee of Sark&#x27;s Chief Pleas.

Sir David Barclay died in January 2021, leaving his brother as the sole tenant of Brecqhou.

===Tenants===
* 1929–1932: Angelo Clarke
* 1932–1944: Thomas Arthur Clarke (1871–1944; left the island 20 June 1940)
* 1949–1966: John Thomson Donaldson
* 1966–1987: Leonard Joseph Matchan 
* 1987–1992: Susan Groves (not recognised by Seigneur of Sark)
* 1993–2021: David and Frederick Barclay
* 2021–: Sir Frederick Barclay

==Flag and stamps==
The former tenant, Leonard Joseph Matchan, had devised a personal flag (identical to the Sark flag, with the exception that the Matchan coat of arms was emblazoned on the bottom right). Although frequently considered the &quot;island flag&quot;, this was only a &quot;personal flag&quot;, and is no longer in use.

The flag has since been adapted to equate with the current tenant, Sir Frederick Barclay. The current flag of Brecqhou remains in the same format as the previous flag, but replaces the Matchan coat of arms with the twins&#x27; coats of arms in the bottom right.

Leonard Joseph Matchan issued postage stamps (labelled &quot;Brechou&quot;) on 30 September 1969, but they were suppressed the following day by the Guernsey Post Office when they took over responsibility from Royal Mail for the issue of stamps. Matchan occupied Brecqhou until his death on 6 October 1987. The current tenants issued stamps annually between 1999 and 2013.

==Public visits==
In 2012, it was reported that the island is open to the public, by prior arrangement.

<text>Biofuel is a fuel that is produced over a short time span from biomass, rather than by the very slow natural processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels such as oil. Biofuel can be produced from plants or from agricultural, domestic or industrial bio waste. Biofuels are mostly used for transportation, but can also be used for heating and electricity. Biofuels (and bio energy in general) are regarded as a renewable energy source. The use of biofuel has been subject to criticism regarding the &quot;food vs fuel&quot; debate, varied assessments of their sustainability, and ongoing deforestation and biodiversity loss as a result of biofuel production.

In general, biofuels emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions when burned in an engine and are generally considered carbon-neutral fuels as the carbon emitted has been captured from the atmosphere by the crops used in production. However, life-cycle assessments of biofuels have shown large emissions associated with the potential land-use change required to produce additional biofuel feedstocks. The outcomes of lifecycle assessments (LCAs) for biofuels are highly situational and dependent on many factors including the type of feedstock, production routes, data variations, and methodological choices. This could be added to emphasize the complexity and variability in assessing the environmental impacts of biofuels. Estimates about the climate impact from biofuels vary widely based on the methodology and exact situation examined. Therefore, the climate change mitigation potential of biofuel varies considerably: in some scenarios emission levels are comparable to fossil fuels, and in other scenarios the biofuel emissions result in negative emissions.

Global demand for biofuels is predicted to increase by 56% over 2022–2027. By 2027 worldwide biofuel production is expected to supply 5.4% of the world&#x27;s fuels for transport including 1% of aviation fuel. Demand for aviation biofuel is forecast to increase. However some policy has been criticised for favoring ground transportation over aviation.

The two most common types of biofuel are bioethanol and biodiesel. Brazil is the largest producer of bioethanol, while the EU is the largest producer of biodiesel. The energy content in the global production of bioethanol and biodiesel is 2.2 and 1.8 EJ per year, respectively.

Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation, mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as maize, sugarcane, or sweet sorghum. Cellulosic biomass, derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane ratings and improve vehicle emissions.

Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification. It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;biofuel&quot; is used in different ways. One definition is &quot;Biofuels are biobased products, in solid, liquid, or gaseous forms. They are produced from crops or natural products, such as wood, or agricultural residues, such as molasses and bagasse.&quot;

Other publications reserve the term biofuel for &quot;liquid&quot; or &quot;gaseous&quot; fuels, used for transportation.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines &quot;biofuel&quot; as &quot;A fuel, generally in liquid form, produced from biomass. Biofuels include bioethanol from sugarcane, sugar beet or maize, and biodiesel from canola or soybeans.&quot;. It goes on to define &quot;biomass&quot; in this context as &quot;organic material excluding the material that is fossilised or embedded in geological formations&quot;. This means that coal or other fossil fuels is not a form of biomass in this context.

=== Conventional biofuels (first generation) ===
&quot;First-generation biofuels&quot; (also denoted as &quot;conventional biofuels&quot;) are made from food crops grown on arable land. The crop&#x27;s sugar, starch, or oil content is converted into biodiesel or ethanol, using transesterification, or yeast fermentation.

=== Advanced biofuels ===
To avoid a &quot;food versus fuel&quot; dilemma, second-generation biofuels and third-generation biofuels (also called advanced biofuels or sustainable biofuels or drop-in biofuels) are made from feedstocks which do not directly compete with food or feed crop such as waste products and energy crops. A wide range of renewable residue feedstocks such as those derived from agriculture and forestry activities like rice straw, rice husk, wood chips, and sawdust can be used to produce advanced biofuels through biochemical and thermochemical processes. 

The feedstock used to make the fuels either grow on arable land but are byproducts of the main crop, or they are grown on marginal land. Second-generation feedstocks also include straw, bagasse, perennial grasses, jatropha, waste vegetable oil, municipal solid waste and so forth.

==Types ==

=== Liquid ===

==== Ethanol ====

Biologically produced alcohols, most commonly ethanol, and less commonly propanol and butanol, are produced by the action of microorganisms and enzymes through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest to produce) or cellulose (more difficult to produce).The IEA estimates that ethanol production used 20% of sugar supplies and 13% of corn supplies in 2021.

Ethanol fuel is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly in Brazil. Alcohol fuels are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from wheat, corn, sugar beets, sugar cane, molasses and any sugar or starch from which alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, can be made (such as potato and fruit waste, etc.). Production methods used are enzyme digestion (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, distillation and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input to generate heat. Heat is sometimes generated with unsustainable natural gas fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as bagasse is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also waste heat are more common in Europe. Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of cellulosic ethanol.

==== Other biofuels ====

Methanol is currently produced from natural gas, a non-renewable fossil fuel. In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as biomethanol. This is technically feasible, but the production is currently being postponed for concerns that the economic viability is still pending. The methanol economy is an alternative to the hydrogen economy to be contrasted with today&#x27;s hydrogen production from natural gas.

Butanol () is formed by ABE fermentation (acetone, butanol, ethanol) and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high net energy gains with biobutanol as the only liquid product. Biobutanol is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it will produce more energy than ethanol and allegedly can be burned &quot;straight&quot; in existing gasoline engines (without modification to the engine or car), is less corrosive and less water-soluble than ethanol, and could be distributed via existing infrastructures. &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; strains have also been successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their amino acid metabolism. One drawback to butanol production in &quot;E. coli&quot; remains the high cost of nutrient rich media, however, recent work has demonstrated &quot;E. coli&quot; can produce butanol with minimal nutritional supplementation. Biobutanol is sometimes called biogasoline, which is incorrect as it is chemically different, being an alcohol and not a hydrocarbon like gasoline.

==== Biodiesel ====

Biodiesel is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters (FAMEs). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, soy, rapeseed, jatropha, mahua, mustard, flax, sunflower, palm oil, hemp, field pennycress, &quot;Pongamia pinnata&quot; and algae. Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as &quot;neat&quot; biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100. , researchers at Australia&#x27;s CSIRO have been studying safflower oil as an engine lubricant, and researchers at Montana State University&#x27;s Advanced Fuels Center in the US have been studying the oil&#x27;s performance in a large diesel engine, with results described as a &quot;breakthrough&quot;.

Biodiesel can be used in any diesel engine and modified equipment when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more viscous at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.

Electronically controlled &#x27;common rail&#x27; and &#x27;Unit Injector&#x27; type systems from the late 1990s onwards can only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are designed to run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the fuel rail design. Since biodiesel is an effective solvent and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, engine filters may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine combustion chamber of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency.

Biodiesel is an oxygenated fuel, meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the combustion of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NOx-emissions Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non-toxic and biodegradable, and has a high flash point of about 300 °F (148 °C) compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125 °F (52 °C).

In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations. In France, biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of 8% in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles. Avril Group produces under the brand Diester, a fifth of 11 million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the European Union. It is the leading European producer of biodiesel.

====Green diesel====

Green diesel can be produced from a combination of biochemical and thermochemical processes. Conventional green diesel is produced through hydroprocessing biological oil feedstocks, such as vegetable oils and animal fats. Recently, it is produced using series of thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis and hydroprocessing. In the thermochemical route, syngas produced from gasification, bio-oil produced from pyrolysis or biocrude produced from hydrothermal liquefaction is upgraded to green diesel using hydroprocessing. Hydroprocessing is the process of using hydrogen to reform a molecular structure. For example, hydrocracking which is a widely used hydroprocessing technique in refineries is used at elevated temperatures and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to break down larger molecules, such as those found in vegetable oils, into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines. Green diesel may also be called renewable diesel, drop-in biodiesel, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO fuel) or hydrogen-derived renewable diesel. Unlike biodiesel, green diesel has exactly the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel. It does not require new engines, pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use, but has not been produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum. Gasoline versions are also being developed. Green diesel is being developed in Louisiana and Singapore by ConocoPhillips, Neste Oil, Valero, Dynamic Fuels, and Honeywell UOP as well as Preem in Gothenburg, Sweden, creating what is known as Evolution Diesel.

====Straight vegetable oil====

Straight unmodified edible vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel, but lower-quality oil has been used for this purpose. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel. The IEA estimates that biodiesel production used 17% of global vegetable oil supplies in 2021.

Oils and fats reacted with 10 pounds of a short-chain alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst (usually sodium hydroxide [NaOH] can be hydrogenated to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high cetane number, low in aromatics and sulfur and does not contain oxygen. Hydrogenated oils can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.

==== Biogasline ====
Biogasoline can be produced biologically and thermochemically. Using biological methods, a study led by Professor Lee Sang-yup at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and published in the international science journal &quot;Nature&quot; used modified &quot;E. coli&quot; fed with glucose found in plants or other non-food crops to produce biogasoline with the produced enzymes. The enzymes converted the sugar into fatty acids and then turned these into hydrocarbons that were chemically and structurally identical to those found in commercial gasoline fuel. The thermochemical approach of producing biogasoline are similar to those used to produce biodiesel. Biogasoline may also be called drop-in gasoline or renewable gasoline.

====Bioethers====

Bioethers (also referred to as fuel ethers or oxygenated fuels) are cost-effective compounds that act as octane rating enhancers. &quot;Bioethers are produced by the reaction of reactive iso-olefins, such as iso-butylene, with bioethanol.&quot; Bioethers are created from wheat or sugar beets, and also be produced from the waste glycerol that results from the production of biodiesel. They also enhance engine performance, while significantly reducing engine wear and toxic exhaust emissions. By greatly reducing the amount of ground-level ozone emissions, they contribute to improved air quality.

In transportation fuel there are six ether additives: dimethyl ether (DME), diethyl ether (DEE), methyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether (ETBE), &quot;tert&quot;-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and &quot;tert&quot;-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE).

The European Fuel Oxygenates Association identifies MTBE and ETBE as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead. Ethers were introduced in Europe in the 1970s to replace the highly toxic compound. Although Europeans still use bioether additives, the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 lifted a requirement for reformulated gasoline to include an oxygenate, leading to less MTBE being added to fuel. Although bioethers are likely to replace ethers produced from petroleum in the UK, it is highly unlikely they will become a fuel in and of itself due to the low energy density.

====Aviation biofuel====
=== Gaseous ===

====Biogas and biomethane====

Biogas is a mixture composed primarily of methane and carbon dioxide produced by the process of anaerobic digestion of organic material by micro-organisms. Other trace components of this mixture includes water vapor, hydrogen sulfide, siloxanes, hydrocarbons, ammonia, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen. It can be produced either from biodegradable waste materials or by the use of energy crops fed into anaerobic digesters to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct, digestate, can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer. When and other impurities are removed from biogas, it is called biomethane. The can also be combined with hydrogen in methanation to form more methane.

Biogas can be recovered from mechanical biological treatment waste processing systems. Landfill gas, a less clean form of biogas, is produced in landfills through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it acts as a greenhouse gas.

In Sweden, &quot;waste-to-energy&quot; power plants capture methane biogas from garbage and use it to power transport systems. Farmers can produce biogas from cattle manure via anaerobic digesters.

==== Syngas ====

Syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen and various hydrocarbons, is produced by partial combustion of biomass (combustion with an amount of oxygen that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water). Before partial combustion the biomass is dried and sometimes pyrolysed. Syngas is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.

Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, turbines or high-temperature fuel cells. The wood gas generator, a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.

Syngas can be used to produce methanol, dimethyl ether and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer–Tropsch process to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700 °C.

Lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing biochar, but results in syngas polluted with tar.

=== Solid ===

The term &quot;biofuels&quot; is also used for solid fuels that are made from biomass, even though this is less common.

== Research into other types ==

=== Algae-based biofuels ===
Algae can be produced in ponds or tanks on land, and out at sea. Algal fuels have high yields, a high ignition point, can be grown with minimal impact on fresh water resources, can be produced using saline water and wastewater, and are biodegradable and relatively harmless to the environment if spilled. However, production requires large amounts of energy and fertilizer, the produced fuel degrades faster than other biofuels, and it does not flow well in cold temperatures.

By 2017, due to economic considerations, most efforts to produce fuel from algae have been abandoned or changed to other applications.

Third and fourth-generation biofuels also include biofuels that are produced by bioengineered organisms i.e. algae and cyanobacteria. Algae and cyanobacteria will use water, carbon dioxide, and solar energy to produce biofuels. This method of biofuel production is still at the research level. The biofuels that are secreted by the bioengineered organisms are expected to have higher photon-to-fuel conversion efficiency, compared to older generations of biofuels. One of the advantages of this class of biofuels is that the cultivation of the organisms that produce the biofuels does not require the use of arable land. The disadvantages include the cost of cultivating the biofuel-producing organisms being very high.

=== Electrofuels and solar fuels ===
Electrofuels and solar fuels may or may not be biofuels, depending on whether they contain biological elements. Electrofuels are made by storing electrical energy in the chemical bonds of liquids and gases. The primary targets are butanol, biodiesel, and hydrogen, but include other alcohols and carbon-containing gases such as methane and butane. A solar fuel is a synthetic chemical fuel produced from solar energy. Light is converted to chemical energy, typically by reducing protons to hydrogen, or carbon dioxide to organic compounds.

== Bio-digesters ==
A bio-digester is a mechanized toilet that uses decomposition and sedimentation to turn human waste into a renewable fuel called biogas. Biogas can be made from substances like agricultural waste and sewage. The bio-digester uses a process called anaerobic digestion to produce biogas. Anaerobic digestion uses a chemical process to break down organic matter with the use of microorganisms in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas. The processes involved in anaerobic respiration are hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis.

== Extent of production and use ==
Global biofuel production was 81 Mtoe in 2017 which represented an annual increase of about 3% compared to 2010. In 2017, the US was the largest biofuel producer in the world producing 37 Mtoe, followed by Brazil and South America at 23 Mtoe and Europe (mainly Germany) at 12 Mtoe.

An assessment from 2017 found that: &quot;Biofuels will never be a major transport fuel as there is just not enough land in the world to grow plants to make biofuel for all vehicles. It can however, be part of an energy mix to take us into a future of renewable energy.&quot;

In 2021, worldwide biofuel production provided 4.3% of the world&#x27;s fuels for transport, including a very small amount of aviation biofuel. By 2027, worldwide biofuel production is expected to supply 5.4% of the world&#x27;s fuels for transport including 1% of aviation fuel.

The US, Europe, Brazil and Indonesia are driving the majority of biofuel consumption growth. This demand for biodiesel, renewable diesel and biojet fuel is projected to increase by 44% (21 billion litres) over 2022-2027.

== Issues ==

=== Environmental impacts ===
Estimates about the climate impact from biofuels vary widely based on the methodology and exact situation examined.

In general, biofuels emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions when burned in an engine and are generally considered carbon-neutral fuels as the carbon they emit has been captured from the atmosphere by the crops used in biofuel production. They can have greenhouse gas emissions ranging from as low as -127.1 gCO2eq per MJ when carbon capture is incorporated into their production to those exceeding 95 gCO2eq per MJ when land-use change is significant. Several factors are responsible for the variation in emission numbers of biofuel, such as feedstock and its origin, fuel production technique, system boundary definitions, and energy sources. However, many government policies, such as those by the European Union and the UK, require that biofuels have at least 65% greenhouse gas emissions savings (or 70% if it is renewable fuels of non-biological origins) relative to fossil fuels.

The growing demand for biofuels has raised concerns about land use and food security. Many biofuel crops are grown on land that could otherwise be used for food production. This shift in land use can lead to several problems:

* Competition with Food Crops: The cultivation of biofuels, especially in food-insecure regions, can drive up the cost of food and reduce the amount of land available for growing essential crops. This can exacerbate global food insecurity, especially in developing countries.
** Deforestation and Habitat Loss: To meet the increasing demand for biofuels, large areas of forests and natural habitats are being cleared for agriculture. This deforestation leads to the loss of biodiversity, threatens wildlife species, and disrupts ecosystems.

=== Biodiversity Loss ===
The expansion of biofuel production, particularly through monoculture farming (growing a single crop on a large scale), poses a significant threat to biodiversity. Large-scale biofuel crop production can lead to:

** Habitat Destruction: The conversion of natural ecosystems into agricultural land can result in the loss of habitats for many plant and animal species, leading to decreased biodiversity.
** Soil Degradation: Monoculture farming can deplete soil nutrients, reduce soil fertility, and increase the need for chemical inputs like fertilizers and pesticides, which can further harm surrounding ecosystems
**** Soil Fertility: Continuous cultivation of biofuel crops without proper crop rotation or sustainable farming practices can lead to soil depletion. Over time, the soil may lose vital nutrients, making it less suitable for farming.
Life-cycle assessments of first-generation biofuels have shown large emissions associated with the potential land-use change required to produce additional biofuel feedstocks. If no land-use change is involved, first-generation biofuels can—on average—have lower emissions than fossil fuels. However, biofuel production can compete with food crop production. Up to 40% of corn produced in the United States is used to make ethanol and worldwide 10% of all grain is turned into biofuel. A 50% reduction in grain used for biofuels in the US and Europe would replace all of Ukraine&#x27;s grain exports. Several studies have shown that reductions in emissions from biofuels are achieved at the expense of other impacts, such as acidification, eutrophication, water footprint and biodiversity loss.

Second-generation biofuels are thought to increase environmental sustainability since the non-food part of plants is being used to produce second-generation biofuels instead of being disposed of. But the use of second-generation biofuels increases the competition for lignocellulosic biomass, increasing the cost of these biofuels.

In theory, third-generation biofuels, produced from algae, shouldn&#x27;t harm the environment more than first- or second-generation biofuels due to lower changes in land use and the fact that they do not require pesticide use for production. When looking at the data however, it has been shown that the environmental cost to produce the infrastructure and energy required for third generation biofuel production, are higher than the benefits provided from the biofuels use.

The European Commission has officially approved a measure to phase out palm oil-based biofuels by 2030. Unsustainable palm oil agriculture has caused significant environmental and social problems, including deforestation and pollution.

The production of biofuels can be very energy intensive, which, if generated from non-renewable sources, can heavily mitigate the benefits gained through biofuel use. A solution proposed to solve this issue is to supply biofuel production facilities with excess nuclear energy, which can supplement the power provided by fossil fuels. This can provide a carbon inexpensive solution to help reduce the environmental impacts of biofuel production.

<doc id="188545" wikidata="Q2551748" url="?curid=188545" title="Hydrogen vehicle">
<text>A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen to move. Hydrogen vehicles include some road vehicles, rail vehicles, space rockets, forklifts, ships and aircraft. Motive power is generated by converting the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy, either by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to power electric motors or, less commonly, by hydrogen internal combustion.

Hydrogen burns cleaner than fuels such as gasoline or methane but is more difficult to store and transport because of the small size of the molecule. As of the 2020s hydrogen light duty vehicles, including passenger cars, have been sold in small numbers due to competition with battery electric vehicles. , there were two models of hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai (2014–), the first commercially produced dedicated fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), and the Hyundai Nexo (2018–). The Honda CR-V e:FCEV became available, for lease only, in very limited quantities in 2024.

As of 2019, 98% of hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming, which emits carbon dioxide. It can be produced by electrolysis of water, or by thermochemical or pyrolytic means using renewable feedstocks, but the processes are currently expensive. Various technologies are being developed that aim to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with hydrogen production using natural gas.

Vehicles running on hydrogen technology benefit from a long range on a single refuelling, but are subject to several drawbacks including high carbon emissions when hydrogen is produced from natural gas, capital cost burden, high energy inputs in production and transportation, low energy content per unit volume at ambient conditions, production and compression of hydrogen, the investment required to build refuelling infrastructure around the world to dispense hydrogen. In addition, leaked hydrogen is an invisible, highly flammable gas and has a global warming effect 11.6 times stronger than CO₂.

==Vehicles==
=== Rationale and context===
The rationale for hydrogen vehicles lies in their potential to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, associated greenhouse gas emissions and localised air pollution from transportation. This would require hydrogen to be produced cleanly, for use in sectors and applications where cheaper and more energy efficient mitigation alternatives are limited.

===Rockets===

Many large rockets use liquid hydrogen as fuel, with liquid oxygen as an oxidizer (LH2/LOX). An advantage of hydrogen rocket fuel is the high effective exhaust velocity compared to kerosene/LOX or UDMH/NTO engines. According to the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, a rocket with higher exhaust velocity uses less propellant to accelerate. Also the energy density of hydrogen is greater than any other fuel. LH2/LOX also yields the greatest efficiency in relation to the amount of propellant consumed, of any known rocket propellant.

A disadvantage of LH2/LOX engines is the low density and low cryogenic temperature required to maintain of hydrogen as a liquid, which means bigger and insulated and thus heavier fuel tanks are needed compared to methane, although methane is more polluting. Another disadvantage is the poor storability of LH2/LOX-powered rockets: Due to the constant hydrogen boil-off, the rocket must be fueled shortly before launch, which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for ICBMs and other rocket applications with the need for short launch preparations. For first stages, dense fuelled rockets in studies may show a small advantage, due to the smaller vehicle size and lower air drag.

LH2/LOX were also used in the Space Shuttle to run the fuel cells that power the electrical systems. The byproduct of the fuel cell is water, which is used for drinking and other applications that require water in space.

===Automobiles===

, there were two hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets: the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai Nexo. The Honda Clarity was produced from 2016 to 2021. Hydrogen combustion cars are not commercially available. In the light road vehicle segment, by the end of 2022, 70,200 fuel cell electric vehicles had been sold worldwide, compared with 26 million plug-in electric vehicles. In 2023, 3,143 hydrogen cars were sold in the US compared with 380,000 BEVs. With the rapid rise of electric vehicles and associated battery technology and infrastructure, the global scope for hydrogen&#x27;s role in cars is shrinking relative to earlier expectations. John Max of &quot;Hydrogen Fuel News&quot; believes that hydrogen may, however, be used directly, or as a feedstock for efuel, for vintage and muscle cars.

The first road vehicle powered by a hydrogen fuel cell was the Chevrolet Electrovan, introduced by General Motors in 1966. The Toyota FCHV and Honda FCX, which began leasing on December 2, 2002, became the world&#x27;s first government-certified commercial hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and the Honda FCX Clarity, which began leasing in 2008, was the world&#x27;s first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle designed for mass production rather than adapting an existing model. Honda established the world&#x27;s first fuel cell vehicle dealer network in 2008, and at the time was the only company able to lease hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to private customers.

The 2013 Hyundai Tucson FCEV, a modified Tucson, was introduced to the market as a lease-only vehicle, and Hyundai Motors claimed it was the world&#x27;s first mass-produced hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. However, due to high prices and a lack of charging infrastructure, sales fell far short of initial plans, with only 273 units sold by the end of May 2015. Hyundai Nexo, which succeeded the Tucson in 2018, was selected as the &quot;safest SUV&quot; by the Euro NCAP in 2018, but In October 2024, Hyundai recalled all 1,600 Nexo vehicles sold in the US to that time due to a risk of fuel leaks and fire from a faulty &quot;pressure relief device&quot;.
Toyota launched the world&#x27;s first dedicated mass-produced fuel cell vehicle (FCV), the Mirai, in Japan at the end of 2014 and began sales in California, mainly the Los Angeles area and also in selected markets in Europe, the UK, Germany and Denmark later in 2015. The car has a range of and takes about five minutes to refill its hydrogen tank. The initial sale price in Japan was about 7 million yen ($69,000). Former European Parliament President Pat Cox estimated that Toyota would initially lose about $100,000 on each Mirai sold. At the end of 2019, Toyota had sold over 10,000 Mirais. Many automobile companies introduced demonstration models in limited numbers (see List of fuel cell vehicles and List of hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles).

In 2013 BMW leased hydrogen technology from Toyota, and a group formed by Ford Motor Company, Daimler AG, and Nissan announced a collaboration on hydrogen technology development. In 2015, Toyota announced that it would offer all 5,680 patents related to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell charging station technology, which it has been researching for over 20 years, to its competitors free of charge to stimulate the market for hydrogen-powered vehicles. By 2017, however, Daimler had abandoned hydrogen vehicle development, and most of the automobile companies developing hydrogen cars had switched their focus to battery electric vehicles. By 2020, all but three automobile companies had abandoned plans to manufacture hydrogen cars. The Honda CR-V e:FCEV became available, for lease only, in very limited quantities in 2024.
A significant number of the public hydrogen fuel stations in the California are not able to dispense hydrogen. In 2024, Mirai owners filed a class action lawsuit in California over the lack of availability of hydrogen available for fuel cell electric cars, alleging, among other things, fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation as well as violations of California’s false advertising law and breaches of implied warranty.

=== Heavy trucks ===
The International Energy Agency&#x27;s 2022 net-zero emissions scenario sees hydrogen meeting approximately 30% of heavy truck energy demand in 2050, mainly for long-distance heavy freight (with battery electric power accounting for around 60%).

United Parcel Service began testing of a hydrogen powered delivery vehicle in 2017. In 2020, Hyundai began commercial production of its Xcient fuel cell trucks and shipped ten of them to Switzerland.

In 2022 in Australia, five hydrogen fuel cell class 8 trucks were placed into use to transport zinc from Sun Metals&#x27; Townsville mine to the Port of Townsville, Queensland, to be shipped around the world.

===Aeroplanes===

Some publications project hydrogen may be used in shipping and jetplanes, while others predict that biofuels and batteries will have more commercial success. Companies such as Boeing, Lange Aviation, and the German Aerospace Center are pursuing hydrogen as fuel for crewed and uncrewed aeroplanes. In February 2008 Boeing tested a crewed flight of a small aircraft powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. Uncrewed hydrogen planes have also been tested. For large passenger aeroplanes, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that &quot;Boeing said that hydrogen fuel cells were unlikely to power the engines of large passenger jet aeroplanes but could be used as backup or auxiliary power units onboard.&quot;

In July 2010, Boeing unveiled its hydrogen-powered Phantom Eye UAV, powered by two Ford internal-combustion engines that have been converted to run on hydrogen.

===Ships===

 hydrogen fuel cells are not suitable for propulsion in large long-distance ships but are being considered as a range-extender for smaller, short-distance, low-speed electric vessels, such as ferries. Hydrogen in ammonia is being considered as a long-distance fuel.

===Buses===
Fuel-cell buses were trialed in Ursus Lublin in 2017. Solaris Bus &amp; Coach introduced its Urbino 12 hydrogen electric buses in 2019. Several dozen were ordered. The first city in the U.S. to have a fleet of hydrogen powered buses was Champaign, Illinois, when in 2021 the Champaign–Urbana Mass Transit District ordered two New Flyer XHE60 articulated hydrogen fuel cell buses, with 10 more New Flyer XHE40 buses added in 2024. In 2022, the city of Montpellier, France, cancelled a contract to procure 51 buses powered by hydrogen fuel cells, when it found that &quot;the cost of operation for hydrogen [buses] is 6 times the cost of electricity&quot;.

===Fork trucks===
A hydrogen internal combustion engine (or &quot;HICE&quot;) forklift or HICE lift truck is a hydrogen fueled, internal combustion engine-powered industrial forklift truck used for lifting and transporting materials. The first production HICE forklift truck based on the Linde X39 Diesel was presented at an exposition in Hannover on May 27, 2008. It used a 2.0 litre, diesel internal combustion engine converted to use hydrogen as a fuel with the use of a compressor and direct injection.

In 2013 there were over 4,000 fuel cell forklifts used in material handling in the US. As of 2024, approximately 50,000 hydrogen forklifts are in operation worldwide (the bulk of which are in the U.S.), as compared with 1.2 million battery electric forklifts that were purchased in 2021.

Most companies in Europe and the US do not use petroleum powered forklifts, as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts. Fuel-cell-powered forklifts can be refueled in 3 minutes. They can be used in refrigerated warehouses, as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. The fuel cell units are often designed as drop-in replacements.

===Trams and trains===

In the International Energy Agency’s 2022 Net Zero Emissions Scenario, hydrogen is forecast to account for 2% of rail energy demand in 2050, while 90% of rail travel is expected to be electrified by then (up from 45% today). Hydrogen’s role in rail would likely be focused on lines that prove difficult or costly to electrify.

In March 2015, China South Rail Corporation (CSR) demonstrated the world&#x27;s first hydrogen fuel cell-powered tramcar at an assembly facility in Qingdao. Tracks for the new vehicle have been built in seven Chinese cities.

In northern Germany in 2018 the first fuel-cell powered Coradia iLint trains were placed into service; excess power is stored in lithium-ion batteries.

===Bicycles and stand-up scooters===

In 2007, Pearl Hydrogen Power Source Technology Co of Shanghai, China, demonstrated a PHB hydrogen bicycle. In 2014, Australian scientists from the University of New South Wales presented their Hy-Cycle model. The same year, Canyon Bicycles started to work on the Eco Speed concept bicycle.

In 2017, Pragma Industries of France developed a bicycle that was able to travel 100 km on a single hydrogen cylinder. In 2019, Pragma announced that the product, &quot;Alpha Bike&quot;, has been improved to offer an electrically assisted pedalling range of 150 km, and the first 200 of the bikes are to be provided to journalists covering the 45th G7 summit in Biarritz, France.

In 2020, Alles over Waterstof developed a 2-wheel hydrogen powered stand-up scooter. The stand-up scooter has a range of over 20 km on 15 grams of hydrogen. It uses a swappable 1 litre 200 bar hydrogen cylinder. In 2021 the company developed a hydrogen powered cargo-bike, using a static 3 litre 300 bar refillable hydrogen cylinder. The HydroCargo bike has a range of up to 100 km on 80 grams of hydrogen.

Lloyd Alter of TreeHugger responded to the announcement, asking &quot;why … go through the trouble of using electricity to make hydrogen, only to turn it back into electricity to charge a battery to run the e-bike [or] pick a fuel that needs an expensive filling station that can only handle 35 bikes a day, when you can charge a battery powered bike anywhere. [If] you were a captive fleet operator, why [not] just swap out batteries to get the range and the fast turnover?&quot;

===Military vehicles===
General Motors&#x27; military division, GM Defense, focuses on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Its SURUS (Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure) is a flexible fuel cell electric platform with autonomous capabilities. Since April 2017, the U.S. Army has been testing the commercial Chevrolet Colorado ZH2 on its U.S. bases to determine the viability of hydrogen-powered vehicles in military mission tactical environments.

===Motorcycles and scooters===
ENV develops electric motorcycles powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, including the Crosscage and Biplane. Other manufacturers as Vectrix are working on hydrogen scooters. Finally, hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-hybrid scooters are being made such as the Suzuki Burgman fuel-cell scooter and the FHybrid. The Burgman received &quot;whole vehicle type&quot; approval in the EU. The Taiwanese company APFCT conducted a live street test with 80 fuel-cell scooters for Taiwan&#x27;s Bureau of Energy.

===Auto rickshaws===
Hydrogen auto rickshaw concept vehicles have been built by Mahindra HyAlfa and Bajaj Auto.

===Quads and tractors===
H-Due, made by Autostudi S.r.l, is a hydrogen-powered quad capable of transporting 1-3 passengers. A concept for a hydrogen-powered tractor has been proposed.

====Auto racing====
A record of was set by a prototype Ford Fusion Hydrogen 999 Fuel Cell Race Car at the Bonneville Salt Flats, in August 2007, using a large compressed oxygen tank to increase power. The land-speed record for a hydrogen-powered vehicle of was set by Ohio State University&#x27;s Buckeye Bullet 2, which achieved a &quot;flying-mile&quot; speed of at the Bonneville Salt Flats in August 2008.

In 2007, the Hydrogen Electric Racing Federation was formed as a racing organization for hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles. The organization sponsored the Hydrogen 500, a 500-mile race.

==Internal combustion vehicle==

Hydrogen internal combustion engine cars are different from hydrogen fuel cell cars. The hydrogen internal combustion car is a slightly modified version of the traditional gasoline internal combustion engine car. These hydrogen engines burn fuel in the same manner that gasoline engines do; the main difference is the exhaust product. Gasoline combustion results in emissions of mostly carbon dioxide and water, plus trace amounts of carbon monoxide, , particulates and unburned hydrocarbons, while the main exhaust product of hydrogen combustion is water vapor.

In 1807 François Isaac de Rivaz designed the first hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine. In 1965, Roger E. Billings, then a high school student, converted a Model A to run on hydrogen. In 1970 Paul Dieges patented a modification to internal combustion engines which allowed a gasoline-powered engine to run on hydrogen.

Mazda has developed Wankel engines burning hydrogen, which are used in the Mazda RX-8 Hydrogen RE. The advantage of using an internal combustion engine, like Wankel and piston engines, is the lower cost of retooling for production.

==Fuel cell==
===Fuel cell cost===
Hydrogen fuel cells are relatively expensive to produce, as their designs require rare substances, such as platinum, as a catalyst. In 2014, former European Parliament President Pat Cox estimated that Toyota would initially lose about $100,000 on each Mirai sold. In 2020, researchers at the University of Copenhagen&#x27;s Department of Chemistry are developing a new type of catalyst that they hope will decrease the cost of fuel cells. This new catalyst uses far less platinum because the platinum nano-particles are not coated over carbon which, in conventional hydrogen fuel cells, keeps the nano-particles in place but also causes the catalyst to become unstable and denatures it slowly, requiring even more platinum. The new technology uses durable nanowires instead of the nano-particles. &quot;The next step for the researchers is to scale up their results so that the technology can be implemented in hydrogen vehicles.&quot;

===Freezing conditions===
The problems in early fuel-cell designs at low temperatures concerning range and cold start capabilities have been addressed so that they &quot;cannot be seen as show-stoppers anymore&quot;. Users in 2014 said that their fuel cell vehicles continue to operate in temperatures below zero without significantly reducing range. Studies using neutron radiography on unassisted cold-start indicate ice formation in the cathode, three stages in cold start and Nafion ionic conductivity. A parameter, defined as coulomb of charge, was also defined to measure cold start capability.

===Service life===
The service life of fuel cells is comparable to that of other vehicles. Polymer-electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell service life is 7,300 hours under cycling conditions.

==Hydrogen==
Hydrogen does not exist in convenient reservoirs or deposits like fossil fuels or helium. It is produced from feedstocks such as natural gas and biomass or electrolyzed from water. A suggested benefit of large-scale deployment of hydrogen vehicles is that it could lead to decreased emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone precursors. However, as of 2014, 95% of hydrogen is made from methane. It can be produced by thermochemical or pyrolitic means using renewable feedstocks, but that is an expensive process.

Renewable electricity can however be used to power the conversion of water into hydrogen: Integrated wind-to-hydrogen (power to gas) plants, using electrolysis of water, are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with traditional energy sources. The challenges facing the use of hydrogen in vehicles include its storage on board the vehicle. As of September 2023, hydrogen cost $36 per kilogram at public fueling stations in California, 14 times as much per mile for a Mirai as compared with a Tesla Model 3.

===Production===

The molecular hydrogen needed as an onboard fuel for hydrogen vehicles can be obtained through many thermochemical methods utilizing natural gas, coal (by a process known as coal gasification), liquefied petroleum gas, biomass (biomass gasification), by a process called thermolysis, or as a microbial waste product called biohydrogen or Biological hydrogen production. 95% of hydrogen is produced using natural gas. Hydrogen can be produced from water by electrolysis at working efficiencies of 65–70%. Hydrogen can be made by chemical reduction using chemical hydrides or aluminum. Current technologies for manufacturing hydrogen use energy in various forms, totaling between 25 and 50 percent of the higher heating value of the hydrogen fuel, used to produce, compress or liquefy, and transmit the hydrogen by pipeline or truck.

Environmental consequences of the production of hydrogen from fossil energy resources include the emission of greenhouse gasses, a consequence that would also result from the on-board reforming of methanol into hydrogen. Hydrogen production using renewable energy resources would not create such emissions, but the scale of renewable energy production would need to be expanded to be used in producing hydrogen for a significant part of transportation needs. In a few countries, renewable sources are being used more widely to produce energy and hydrogen. For example, Iceland is using geothermal power to produce hydrogen, and Denmark is using wind.

===Storage===
Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology.

Hydrogen has a very low volumetric energy density at ambient conditions, compared with gasoline and other vehicle fuels. It must be stored in a vehicle either as a super-cooled liquid or as highly compressed gas, which require additional energy to accomplish. In 2018, researchers at CSIRO in Australia powered a Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo with hydrogen separated from ammonia using a membrane technology. Ammonia is easier to transport safely in tankers than pure hydrogen.

===Infrastructure===

To enable the delivery of hydrogen fuel to transport end-users, a broad range of investments are needed, including, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the &quot;construction and operation of new port infrastructure, buffer storage, pipelines, ships, refueling stations and plants to convert the hydrogen into a more readily transportable commodity (and potentially back to hydrogen)&quot;. In particular, the IEA notes that refueling stations will be needed in locations that are suitable for long‐distance trucking such as industrial hubs and identifies the need for investment in airport infrastructure for the storage and delivery of hydrogen. The IEA deems the infrastructure requirements for hydrogen in shipping more challenging, drawing attention to the &quot;need for major investments and co‐ordinated efforts among fuel suppliers, ports, shipbuilders and shippers&quot;.

, there were 53 publicly accessible hydrogen refueling stations in the US, 52 of which were located in California (compared with 65,000 electric charging stations). By 2017, there were 91 hydrogen fueling stations in Japan. In 2024, Mirai owners filed a class action lawsuit in California over the lack of availability of hydrogen available for fuel cell electric cars, alleging, among other things, fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation as well as violations of California’s false advertising law and breaches of implied warranty.

===Codes and standards===
Hydrogen codes and standards, as well as codes and technical standards for hydrogen safety and the storage of hydrogen, have been an institutional barrier to deploying hydrogen technologies. To enable the commercialization of hydrogen in consumer products, new codes and standards must be developed and adopted by federal, state and local governments.

==Official support==

===U.S. initiatives===
Fuel cell buses are supported.

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) has created incentives for hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks and buses.

==Criticism of hydrogen cars==
Critics argue that implementing wide-scale use of hydrogen in cars is unlikely during at least the next several decades and that the hydrogen car is a dangerous distraction from more readily available solutions to reducing the use of fossil fuels in vehicles.

Former U.S. Department of Energy official Joseph Romm has said: &quot;A hydrogen car is one of the least efficient, most expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gases.&quot; He argued that the cost to build out a nationwide network of hydrogen refueling stations would be prohibitive. Robert Zubrin, the author of &quot;Energy Victory&quot;, stated: &quot;Hydrogen is &#x27;just about the worst possible vehicle fuel&#x27;&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; noted that most hydrogen is produced through steam methane reformation, which creates at least as much emission of carbon per mile as some of today&#x27;s gasoline cars, and that if the hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy, &quot;it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.&quot; Over their lifetimes, hydrogen vehicles will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; asked in 2009, &quot;[W]hy would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor, when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over America and stored in auto batteries&quot;?

Volkswagen&#x27;s Rudolf Krebs said in 2013: &quot;Hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy&quot;, but ... you need to convert it first into hydrogen &quot;with low efficiencies&quot; where &quot;you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy&quot;. You then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more energy. &quot;And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss&quot;. Krebs continued: &quot;in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent.&quot; A 2016 study in &quot;Energy&quot; by scientists at Stanford University and the Technical University of Munich concluded that, even assuming local hydrogen production, &quot;investing in all-electric battery vehicles is a more economical choice for reducing carbon dioxide emissions&quot;.

A 2017 analysis published in &quot;Green Car Reports&quot; concluded that the best hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles consume &quot;more than three times more electricity per mile than an electric vehicle ... generate more greenhouse gas emissions than other powertrain technologies ... [and have] very high fuel costs. ... Considering all the obstacles and requirements for new infrastructure (estimated to cost as much as $400 billion), fuel-cell vehicles seem likely to be a niche technology at best, with little impact on U.S. oil consumption. The US Department of Energy agrees, for fuel produced by grid electricity via electrolysis, but not for most other pathways for generation. A 2019 video by &quot;Real Engineering&quot; concluded that the hydrogen needed to move a FCV a kilometer costs approximately 8 times as much as the electricity needed to move a BEV the same distance.

Assessments since 2020 have concluded that hydrogen vehicles are still only 38% efficient, while battery EVs are from 80% to 95% efficient. A 2021 assessment by &quot;CleanTechnica&quot; found that the vast majority of hydrogen was being produced was still polluting grey hydrogen, and delivering hydrogen would require building a vast and expensive new infrastructure, while the remaining two &quot;advantages of fuel cell vehicles – longer range and fast fueling times – are rapidly being eroded by improving battery and charging technology.&quot; A 2022 study in &quot;Nature Electronics&quot; agreed. Another 2022 article, in &quot;Recharge News&quot;, stated that ships are more likely to be powered by ammonia or methanol than hydrogen. Also in 2022, Germany&#x27;s Fraunhofer Institute concluded that hydrogen is unlikely to play a major role in road transport.

A 2023 study by the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO) estimated that leaked hydrogen has a global warming effect 11.6 times stronger than CO₂.

==Safety and supply==

Hydrogen fuel is hazardous because of the low ignition energy (see also autoignition temperature) and high combustion energy of hydrogen, and because it tends to leak easily from tanks due to its small molecular size. In 2024, Hyundai recalled all 1,600 Nexo vehicles sold in the US to that time due to a risk of fuel leaks and fire from a faulty &quot;pressure relief device&quot;. Hydrogen embrittlement is also a concern for the storage tank material, as well as the car parts surrounding the tank if chronic leakage is present. Hydrogen is odorless so leakages are not easily picked up without specialized detectors.

Explosions at hydrogen filling stations have been reported. Hydrogen fuelling stations generally receive deliveries of hydrogen by truck from hydrogen suppliers. An interruption at a hydrogen supply facility can shut down multiple hydrogen fuelling stations.

==Comparison with other types of alternative fuel vehicle==

Hydrogen vehicles compete with various proposed alternatives to the modern fossil fuel internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle infrastructure.

===Natural gas===

ICE-based compressed natural gas(CNG), HCNG, LPG or LNG vehicles, collectively called natural gas vehicles (NGVs), use methane harvested from natural gas or Biogas as a fuel source. Methane has a higher energy density than hydrogen, and NGVs from Biogas are nearly carbon neutral. Unlike hydrogen vehicles, CNG vehicle technology has been available for many decades, and there is sufficient infrastructure in existing filling stations to provide both commercial and home refueling. Worldwide, there were 14.8 million natural gas vehicles by the end of 2011, mostly in the form of bi-fuel vehicles. The other use for natural gas is in steam reforming which is the common way to produce hydrogen gas for use in electric cars with fuel cells.

Methane is also an alternative rocket fuel.

=== Plug-in electric ===
==== Plug-in hybrid ====

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are hybrid electric vehicles that can be plugged into the electric grid to recharge the on-board battery pack, rather than relying purely on the internal combustion engine to drive a generator to power the electric motor and battery pack as in conventional hybrid vehicles. The PHEV concept augments the vehicle&#x27;s fuel efficiency by allowing more EV mode driving, at the same time alleviating range anxiety by having the internal combustion engine (typically a turbo petrol engine) as an auxiliary powerplant or range extender.

==== Battery electric ====

In the light road vehicle segment, by 2023, 26 million battery electric vehicles had been sold worldwide, and there were 65,730 public charging stations in North America, in addition to the availability of home and workplace charging via AC power plugs and sockets. Long distance electric trucks require more megawatt charging infrastructure.

=== Aviation biofuel ===
Hannah Ritchie has argued that there may not be enough land to produce enough aviation biofuel.

<text>Bôa (stylized bôa) are an English alternative rock band formed in London in 1993 by drummer Ed Herten, keyboardist Paul Turrell, and guitarist/vocalist Steve Rodgers. The band have progressed from playing funk to rock over the years, as bassist Alex Caird and multi-instrumentalist Ben Henderson joined, and Jasmine Rodgers was added as vocalist.

Bôa produced two major albums, &quot;Twilight&quot; (2001) and &quot;Get There&quot; (2005). Their 1998 single &quot;Duvet&quot; has been certified Platinum by the RIAA.

The band released the album &quot;Whiplash&quot; in 2024, their first new music in 19 years.

==History==
Originally a funk band, Bôa was formed in 1993 by drummer Ed Herten, keyboardist Paul Turrell, and Steve Rodgers on guitar and vocals. Alex Caird, who had played with Herten in the band Draggin&#x27; Bones, was recruited on bass guitar. Rodgers&#x27;s younger sister, Jasmine, was invited to sing the chorus of one of their first songs, &quot;Fran&quot;, and she soon became the lead singer of the group. Jasmine and Steve are children of Paul Rodgers, best known for being the vocalist of Bad Company. Ben Henderson, who had played with Caird in the psychedelic rock band Doctor Sky, was recruited shortly afterward to play saxophone.

Bôa&#x27;s first live performance was in January 1994, at the London Forum, supporting Paul Rodgers. The same year, Herten left the band.

Bôa added a new drummer, Lee Sullivan, the son of Terry Sullivan, a former drummer for the band Renaissance. The group&#x27;s style began to shift to a rock sound around this time, and Henderson took up playing the guitar instead of the saxophone.

In 1996, the band signed a contract with the Japanese label Polystar and began working on their debut album. They recorded three songs, &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;Deeply&quot;, and &quot;Elephant&quot;, with producer Darren Allison. The record, titled &quot;The Race of a Thousand Camels&quot;, came out in 1998, preceded by the single &quot;Duvet&quot;. The track was used as the opening theme of the Japanese anime series &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;.

In 2000, Polystar released Bôa&#x27;s &quot;Tall Snake&quot; EP and featured &quot;Duvet&quot; on the &quot;20th Anniversary of Polystar Collection Vol.1 Female Vocal Love Songs&quot; compilation. The same year, Henderson left the band.

In 2001, due to contractual disagreements with Polystar, the band changed labels and signed with Pioneer LDC. &quot;Race of a Thousand Camels&quot; was retitled &quot;Twilight&quot; and released to US audiences in 2001, with two new tracks. Bôa played shows across the US to promote the record, but halfway through the tour, Turrell departed the group.

In 2003, &quot;Duvet&quot; was remixed by DJ Wasei and released on another &quot;Lain&quot; soundtrack, titled &quot;Serial Experiment Lain Soundtrack: Cyberia Mix&quot;.

That year, Bôa decided to establish their own label, called Boa Recordings. They also began work on their third album, titled &quot;Get There&quot;, and released it in 2005. Steve Rodgers parted with the band later in 2005 to pursue independent work, stating in an interview with &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; that he &quot;had a lot [he] wanted to sing about and there&#x27;s a lot of freedom when you&#x27;re solo&quot;.

In 2012, Bôa started a JustGiving page and announced their support for AAR JAPAN, a charity that responded to the impact of the 2011 tsunami.

On 4 January 2017, former keyboard player Paul Turrell died. In May, an unreleased Bôa album was discovered on Turrell&#x27;s website, titled &quot;The Farm&quot;.

In December 2018, a vinyl edition of &quot;Duvet&quot; was published exclusively in Japan. In August 2021, the song saw a massive resurgence in popularity, especially on TikTok, with over 250,000 posts featuring it as of August 2023. In September, it reached the Official Independent Singles Breakers Chart and peaked at number 18, charting for two weeks.

In June 2023, Bôa announced that they would release a new album, titled &quot;Whiplash&quot;. In March 2024, they issued the single &quot;Walk with Me&quot;, their first new music in 19 years. A second single, &quot;Beautiful &amp; Broken&quot;, came out on 3 May. They released the tracks &quot;Worry&quot; on 14 June and &quot;Whiplash&quot; on 29 July. The fifth single from the album, &quot;Vienna&quot;, came out on 6 September. On 16 October 2024, the band received Platinum certification from the RIAA for &quot;Duvet&quot;.

==Side projects==
In September 2004, Steve and Jasmine performed the Bôa song &quot;Drinking&quot; with their father for a concert featuring Joe Walsh, Gary Moore, Brian May, Hank Marvin, David Gilmour, and Mike Rutherford, among others, marking the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar. The event was recorded and released a year later as the film &quot;The Strat Pack: Live in Concert&quot;.

Jasmine Rodgers records as a solo artist, and she has released a self-titled EP (2010) and the full-length albums &quot;Blood Red Sun&quot; (2016) and &quot;Dark Tides&quot; (2024).

<doc id="188548" wikidata="Q183246" url="?curid=188548" title="Samuel Colt">
<text>Samuel Colt (; July 19, 1814 – January 10, 1862) was an American inventor, industrialist, and businessman who established Colt&#x27;s Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company and made the mass production of revolvers commercially viable.

Colt&#x27;s first two business ventures were producing firearms in Paterson, New Jersey, and making underwater mines; both ended in disappointment. His business expanded rapidly after 1847, when the Texas Rangers ordered 1,000 revolvers during the American war with Mexico. During the American Civil War, his factory in Hartford supplied firearms both to the North and the South. Later, his firearms were used widely during the settling of the western frontier. When Colt died in 1862, he was one of the wealthiest men in the United States. 

Colt&#x27;s manufacturing methods were at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. His use of interchangeable parts helped him become one of the first to make efficient use of the assembly line manufacturing process. Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements, and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in advertising, product placement, and mass marketing.

== Early years (1814–1835) ==

Samuel Colt was born in Hartford, Connecticut the son of Christopher Colt (1780–1850), a farmer who had moved his family to the city after he became a businessman, and Sarah (&quot;née&quot; Caldwell). His maternal grandfather, Major John Caldwell, had been an officer in the Continental Army; one of Colt&#x27;s earliest possessions was John&#x27;s flintlock pistol. Colt&#x27;s mother died from tuberculosis when Colt was six years old, and his father married Olivia Sargeant two years later. Colt had three sisters, one of whom died during her childhood. His oldest sister, Margaret, died of tuberculosis at age 19, and the other, Sarah Ann, later died by suicide. One brother, James, became a lawyer; another, Christopher, was a textile merchant. A third brother, John C. Colt, a man of many occupations, was convicted of an 1841 murder and died by suicide on the day he was to be executed.

At age 11, Colt was indentured to a farmer in Glastonbury, where he did chores and attended school. Here he was introduced to the &quot;Compendium of Knowledge&quot;, a scientific encyclopedia that he preferred to read rather than his Bible studies. Its articles about Robert Fulton and gunpowder motivated Colt throughout his life. He discovered that other inventors in the &quot;Compendium&quot; had accomplished feats that were once deemed impossible, and he wanted to do the same. Later, after hearing soldiers talk about the success of the double-barreled rifle and the impossibility of a gun that could shoot five or six times without reloading, Colt decided that he would create the &quot;impossible gun&quot;.

In 1829, at the age of 15, Colt began working in his father&#x27;s textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers&#x27; expertise. Using what he learned from the &quot;Compendium&quot;, Samuel built a homemade galvanic cell, and advertised that as a Fourth of July event that year that he would explode a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him away to learn the seaman&#x27;s trade. On a voyage to Calcutta aboard the brig &quot;Corvo&quot;, Colt had the idea for a type of revolver, inspired by capstans and windlasses, which have a ratchet-and-pawl mechanism he would later say gave him the idea for his revolver designs. On the &quot;Corvo&quot;, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it allowed the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer, with an attached pawl turning the cylinder, which was then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the earlier designs, which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.

When Colt returned to the United States in 1832, he resumed working for his father, who financed the production of two guns, a rifle and a pistol. The first completed pistol exploded when it was fired, but the rifle performed well. His father would not finance any further development, so Samuel needed to find a way to pay for the development of his ideas. He had learned about nitrous oxide (laughing gas) from the chemist at his father&#x27;s textile plant, so he took a portable laboratory on tour and earned a living performing laughing gas demonstrations across the United States and Canada, calling himself as &quot;the Celebrated Dr. Colt of New-York, London and Calcutta&quot;. Colt thought of himself as a man of science and believed if he could enlighten people about a new idea like nitrous oxide, he could in turn make people more receptive to his new idea concerning a revolver. He started his lectures on street corners and soon worked his way up to lecture halls and museums. As ticket sales declined, Colt realized that &quot;serious&quot; museum lectures were not what the people wanted to pay for; it was dramatic stories of salvation and redemption the public craved. While visiting his brother John in Cincinnati, he partnered with sculptor Hiram Powers for his demonstrations with a theme based on &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;. Powers made detailed wax sculptures and paintings based on demons, centaurs, and mummies from Dante&#x27;s work. Colt constructed fireworks for the finale of the show, which was a success. According to Colt historian Robert Lawrence Wilson, the &quot;lectures launched Colt&#x27;s celebrated career as a pioneer Madison Avenue-style pitchman&quot;. His public speaking skills were so prized that he was thought to be a doctor and was pressed into service to cure an apparent cholera epidemic aboard a riverboat by giving stricken passengers a dose of nitrous oxide.

Having saved some money and still wanting to be considered an inventor as opposed to a &quot;medicine man&quot;, Colt made arrangements to begin building guns using proper gunsmiths from Baltimore, Maryland. He abandoned the idea of a multiple-barreled revolver and opted for a single fixed-barrel design with a rotating cylinder. The action of the hammer would align the cylinder bores with the single barrel. He sought the counsel of a friend of his father, Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, who loaned him $300 and advised him to perfect his prototype before applying for a patent. Colt hired a gunsmith by the name of John Pearson to build his revolver. Over the next few years, Colt and Pearson argued about money, but the design improved and by 1835 Colt was ready to apply for his U.S. patent. Ellsworth was now the superintendent of the U.S. Patent Office and advised Colt to file for foreign patents first, as a prior U.S. patent would keep Colt from filing a patent in the United Kingdom. In August 1835, Colt left for England and France to secure his foreign patents.

== Colt&#x27;s early revolver (1835–1843) ==

Colt&#x27;s trip to the United Kingdom had been preceded by a similar visit by Elisha Collier, a Bostonian who had patented a revolving flintlock there that achieved great popularity. Despite the reluctance of English officials to issue a patent to Colt, no fault could be found with the gun and he was issued his first patent (number 6909). Upon his return to America, he applied for his U.S. patent for a &quot;revolving gun&quot;; he was granted the patent on February 25, 1836 (later numbered 9430X). This instrument and patent number 1304, dated August 29, 1836, protected the basic principles of his revolving-breech loading, folding trigger firearm named the Colt Paterson.

With a loan from his cousin Dudley Selden and letters of recommendation from Ellsworth, Colt formed a corporation of venture capitalists in 1836 to bring his idea to market. With the help of the political connections of these venture capitalists, the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of Paterson, New Jersey, was chartered by the New Jersey legislature on March 5, 1836. Colt was given a royalty for each gun sold in exchange for his share of patent rights, and it was stipulated that rights would be returned to Colt if the company disbanded.

Colt never claimed to have invented the revolver; his design was a more practical adaption of Collier&#x27;s earlier revolving flintlock, incorporating a locking bolt to keep the cylinder aligned with the barrel. The invention of the percussion cap made ignition more reliable, faster, and safer than the older flintlock design. Colt&#x27;s great contribution was the use of interchangeable parts. Knowing that some gun parts were made by machine, he envisioned all the parts of every Colt gun to be interchangeable and made by machine, to be assembled later by hand. His goal was an assembly line. This is shown in an 1836 letter that Colt wrote to his father in which he said: 

Colt&#x27;s U.S. revolver patent gave him a monopoly on revolver manufacture until 1857. His was the first practical revolver and the first practical repeating firearm, thanks to progress made in percussion technology. No longer a mere novelty weapon, the revolver became an industrial and cultural legacy, as well as a contribution to the development of war technology, ironically signified in the name of one of his company&#x27;s later innovations, the &quot;Peacemaker&quot;.

== Early problems and failures ==
Although by the end of 1837 the Arms Company had made more than 1,000 weapons, there had been no sales. After the Panic of 1837, the company&#x27;s underwriters were reluctant to fund the new machinery that Colt needed to make interchangeable parts, so he went on the road to raise money. Demonstrating his gun to people in general stores did not generate the sales volume he needed, so with another loan from his cousin Selden, he went to Washington, D.C., and demonstrated it to President Andrew Jackson. Jackson approved of the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. With this letter, Colt pushed a bill through Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military, but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon. A promising order from the state of South Carolina for 50 to 75 pistols was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough.

The provisions of the Militia Act of 1808 were a constant problem for Colt, as they required that any arms purchased by a state militia had to be in current service in the United States military. This prevented state militias from allocating funds for the purchase of experimental weapons or foreign weapons.

Colt undermined his own company with his reckless spending. Selden often chastised him for using corporate funds to buy an expensive wardrobe or give lavish gifts to potential clients. Selden twice prohibited Colt from using company money for liquor and fancy dinners; Colt thought getting potential customers inebriated would generate more sales.

The company was given a brief reprieve by the war against the Seminoles in Florida, which provided the first sale of Colt&#x27;s revolvers and his new revolving rifles. The soldiers in Florida praised the new weapon, but the unusual hammerless design, sixty years ahead of its time, made it difficult to train men who were used to exposed-hammer guns. Many curious soldiers took the locks apart, resulting in broken parts, stripped screw heads and inoperable guns. Colt soon reworked his design to leave the firing hammer exposed, but problems continued. In late 1843, after the loss of payment for the Florida pistols, the Paterson plant closed and a public auction was held in New York City to sell the company&#x27;s most liquid assets.

== Mines and tinfoil ==
Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing as he turned to selling underwater electrical detonators and waterproof cable of his own invention. Soon after the failure of the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds. Colt&#x27;s waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, and bays and made attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt&#x27;s mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.

As tensions with the British grew toward the end of 1841, Colt demonstrated his underwater mines to the US government, prompting Congress to appropriate funds for his project. In 1842, he used one of the devices to destroy a moving vessel, to the satisfaction of the United States Navy and President John Tyler. However, opposition from John Quincy Adams, who was serving as a US Representative from Massachusetts&#x27;s 8th congressional district, scuttled the project as &quot;not fair and honest warfare&quot;, calling the Colt mine an &quot;unchristian contraption&quot;.

After this setback, Colt turned his attention to perfecting tinfoil cartridges he had originally designed for use in his revolvers. The standard at the time was to have powder and ball contained in a paper or skin envelope (&quot;cartridge&quot;) for ease of loading. However, if the paper got wet, the powder would be ruined. Colt tried alternative materials such as rubber cement, finally deciding on a thin type of tinfoil. In 1841 he made samples of these cartridges for the army. During tests of the foil cartridges, 25 rounds were shot from a musket without cleaning. When the breech plug was removed from the barrel, no fouling from the tin foil was evident. The reception was lukewarm, but the army purchased a few thousand rounds for further testing. In 1843 the army gave Colt an order for 200,000 of the tinfoil cartridges packed 10 to a box for use in muskets.

With the money made from the cartridges, Colt resumed business with Morse for ideas other than detonating mines. Colt concentrated on manufacturing his waterproof telegraph cable, believing the business would prosper in tandem with Morse&#x27;s invention. He began promoting the telegraph companies to create a greater market for his cable, for which he was to be paid $50 per mile. Colt tried to use this revenue to resurrect the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, but could not secure funds from other investors or even his own family. This left Colt time to improve his earlier revolver design and have a prototype for his &quot;new and improved revolver&quot; built by a gunsmith in New York. This new revolver had a stationary trigger and a larger caliber. Colt submitted his single prototype to the War Department as a &quot;Holster revolver&quot;.

== Colt&#x27;s Patent Manufacturing Company (1847–1860) ==

Captain Samuel Walker of the Texas Rangers had acquired some of the first Colt revolvers produced during the Seminole War and saw firsthand their effective use when his 15-man unit defeated a larger force of 70 Comanches in Texas. Walker wanted to order Colt revolvers for use by the Rangers in the Mexican–American War and traveled to New York City in search of Colt. On January 4, 1847, he met Colt in a gunsmith&#x27;s shop and ordered 1,000 revolvers. Walker asked for a few changes: the new revolvers would have to hold six shots instead of five, have enough power to kill either a human or a horse with a single shot, and be quicker to reload. The large order allowed Colt to establish a new firearm business. He hired Eli Whitney Blake, who was established in the arms business, to make his guns. Colt used his prototype and Walker&#x27;s improvements as the basis for a new design. From this new design, known as the Colt Walker, Blake produced the first thousand-piece order. The company then received an order for a thousand more; Colt shared the profits at $10 per pistol for both orders.

With the money he made from the sales of the Walkers and a loan from his cousin, banker Elisha Colt, Colt bought the machinery and tooling from Blake to build his own factory: Colt&#x27;s Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company factory at Hartford. The first revolving-breech pistols made at the factory were named &quot;Whitneyville-Hartford-Dragoons&quot; and became so popular that the word &quot;Colt&quot; was often used as a generic term for &quot;revolver&quot;. The Whitneyville-Hartford Dragoon, largely built from leftover Walker parts, is known as the first model in the transition from the Walker to the Dragoon series. Beginning in 1848, more contracts followed for what is known now as the Colt Dragoon Revolver. These models were based on the Walker Colt, and slight changes to each model over three generations marked the rapid evolution of the design. The improvements were: barrels for accuracy, shorter chambers, and an improved loading lever. The shorter chambers were loaded to 50 grains of powder, instead of 60 grains in the earlier Walkers, to prevent ruptured cylinders. Finally, a positive catch was installed at the end of the loading lever to prevent the lever from dropping due to recoil.

Besides being used in the Mexican–American War, Colt&#x27;s revolvers were employed as a sidearm by both civilians and soldiers. Colt&#x27;s revolvers were a key tool of the westward expansion: a revolver which could fire six times without reloading helped soldiers and settlers fend off larger forces not armed in the same way. In 1848 Colt introduced smaller versions of his pistols for civilian use, known as &quot;Baby Dragoons&quot;. In 1850 General Sam Houston and General Thomas Jefferson Rusk lobbied Secretary of War William Marcy and President James K. Polk to adopt Colt&#x27;s revolvers for the U.S. military. Rusk testified: &quot;Colt&#x27;s Repeating Arms are the most efficient weapons in the world and the only weapon which has enabled the frontiersman to defeat the mounted Indian in his own peculiar mode of warfare.&quot; Lt. Bedley McDonald, a subordinate of Walker at the time Walker was killed in Mexico, stated that 30 Rangers used Colt&#x27;s revolvers to keep over 300 Mexicans in check. Colt followed this design with the Colt 1851 Navy Revolver, which was larger than the Baby Dragoon but not quite as large as the full-sized version. It became the standard sidearm for U.S. military officers and also proved popular among civilian buyers. After the testimony by Houston and Rusk, the next issue became how quickly Colt could supply the military. Ever the opportunist, when the war with Mexico ended, Colt sent agents south of the border to procure sales from the Mexican government.

=== Patent extension ===
During this period, Colt received an extension on his patent, since he had not collected fees for it in its early years. In 1849, gun makers James Warner and Massachusetts Arms infringed on the patent. Colt sued the companies, and the court ordered that Warner and Massachusetts Arms cease revolver production. In 1852, Colt threatened to sue another company, Allen &amp; Thurber, over the cylinder design of their double-action pepperbox revolver. However, Colt&#x27;s lawyers doubted that this suit would be successful, and the case was resolved with a settlement of $15,000. Production of Allen pepperboxes continued until the expiration of Colt&#x27;s patent in 1857. In 1854 Colt fought for his patent extension with the U.S. Congress, which initiated a special committee to investigate charges that Colt had bribed government officials in securing this extension. By August he was exonerated, and the story became national news when &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine reported that the fault was not with Colt, but with Washington politicians. With a virtual monopoly, Colt sold his pistols in Europe, where demand was high due to tense international relations. By telling each nation that the others were buying Colt&#x27;s pistols, Colt was able to get large orders from many countries who feared falling behind in the arms race.

A major reason for Colt&#x27;s success was vigorous protection of his patent rights. Even though he held the only lawful patent for his type of revolver, scores of imitators copied his work and Colt found himself constantly in litigation. In each case, Colt&#x27;s lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down the competitor. However, Colt&#x27;s zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company&#x27;s transition to the cartridge system and prevented other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt&#x27;s policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result, they created their own.

Colt knew he had to make his revolvers affordable, as the doom of many great inventions was a high retail price. Colt fixed his prices at a level below his competition to maximize sales volume. From his experience in haggling with government officials, he knew what numbers he would have to generate to make enough profit to invest money in improving his machinery, thereby limiting imitators&#x27; ability to produce a comparable weapon at a lower price.

Although successful at this, for the most part, his preoccupation with marketing strategies and patent protection caused him to miss a great opportunity in firearms development when he dismissed an idea from one of his gunsmiths, Rollin White. White had the idea of a &quot;bored-through&quot; revolver cylinder to allow cartridges (made of paper at the time) to be loaded from the rear of the cylinder. Only one gun fitting White&#x27;s design was ever made, and it was not considered practical for the ammunition of the time. A year after White left Colt, Colt&#x27;s competitor, Smith &amp; Wesson, attempted to patent a revolver using metallic cartridges only to find that it infringed on White&#x27;s patent for the bored-through cylinder. They then licensed that component of White&#x27;s patent and kept Colt from being able to build cartridge firearms for almost 20 years.

=== Colt&#x27;s armories ===

==== Hartford ====

Colt purchased a large tract of land beside the Connecticut River, where he built: his first factory in 1848; a larger factory (the Colt Armory) in 1855; the manor Armsmear in 1856; and employee tenement housing. He established a ten-hour work day for employees, installed washing stations in the factory, mandated a one-hour lunch break, and built the Charter Oak Hall, where employees could enjoy games, newspapers, and discussion rooms. Colt managed his plant with a military-like discipline: he would dismiss workers for tardiness, sub-par work, or even suggesting improvements to his designs.

As he set up his plant&#x27;s machinery, Colt hired Elisha K. Root as his chief mechanic. Root had been successful in an earlier venture automating the production of axes and made, bought, or improved jigs, fixtures and profile machinery for Colt. Over the years he developed specialized machinery for stock turning or cutting the rifling in gun barrels. Historian Barbara Clark credited Root as &quot;the first to build special purpose machinery and apply it to the manufacture of a commercial product.&quot; Colt historian Herbert G. Houze wrote, &quot;Had it not been for Root&#x27;s inventive genius, Colt&#x27;s dream of mass production would never have been realized.&quot;

Thus, Colt&#x27;s factory was the first to make use of the concept known as the assembly line. The idea was not new but was never successful in industry at the time because of the lack of interchangeable parts. Root&#x27;s machinery changed that for Colt, since the machines completed as much as 80% of the work and less than 20% of the parts required hand fitting and filing. Colt&#x27;s revolvers were made by machine, but he insisted on final hand finishing and polishing of his revolvers to impart a handmade feel. Colt hired artisan gun makers from Bavaria and developed a commercial use for Waterman Ormsby&#x27;s grammagraph to produce &quot;roll-die&quot; engraving on steel, particularly on the cylinders. He hired Bavarian engraver Gustave Young for fine hand engraving on his more &quot;custom&quot; pieces. In an attempt to attract skilled European-immigrant workers to his plant, Colt built a village near the factory away from the tenements which he named Coltsville and modeled the homes after a village in Potsdam. In an effort to stem flooding from the river he planted German osiers, a type of willow tree, in a 2-mile-long dike. He subsequently built a factory to manufacture wicker furniture made from these trees.

On June 5, 1856, Colt married Elizabeth Jarvis, the daughter of the Rev. William Jarvis, who lived downriver from Hartford. The wedding was lavish and featured the ceremony on a steamship overlooking the factory as well as fireworks and rifle salutes. The couple had four children: two daughters and a son who died in infancy and a son born in 1858, Caldwell Hart Colt.

==== London ====
Soon after establishing his Hartford factory, Colt decided to establish another factory in or near Europe, and chose London. He organized a large display of his firearms at the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park, London and ingratiated himself by presenting cased engraved Colt revolvers to such appropriate officials as Britain&#x27;s Master General of the Ordnance. At one exhibit Colt disassembled ten guns and reassembled ten guns using different parts from different guns. As the world&#x27;s leading proponent of mass production techniques, Colt delivered a lecture concerning the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in London. The membership rewarded his efforts by awarding him the Silver Telford Medal. With help from ICE secretary Charles Manby Colt established his London operation near Vauxhall Bridge on the River Thames and began production on January 1, 1853. During a tour of the factory, Charles Dickens was so impressed with the facilities that he later published his comments on Colt&#x27;s revolvers in an 1852 issue of &quot;Household Words&quot; magazine:
Among the pistols, we saw Colt&#x27;s revolver; and we compared it with the best English revolver. The advantage of Colt&#x27;s over the English is, that the user can take a sight; and the disadvantage is, that the weapon requires both hands to fire.

The factory&#x27;s machines mass-produced parts that were completely interchangeable and could be put together on assembly lines using standardized patterns and gauges by unskilled labor, as opposed to England&#x27;s top gun makers, who made each part by hand.

Colt&#x27;s London factory remained in operation for only four years. Unwilling to alter his open-top single-action design for the solid frame double-action revolver that the British asked for, Colt sold scarcely 23,000 revolvers to the British Army and Navy. In 1856 he closed the London plant and had the machinery, tooling, and unfinished guns shipped to Hartford.

=== Marketing ===
When foreign heads of state would not grant him an audience, as he was only a private citizen, he persuaded the governor of the state of Connecticut to make him a lieutenant colonel and aide-de-camp of the state militia. With this rank, he toured Europe again to promote his revolvers. He used marketing techniques which were innovative at the time. He frequently gave custom engraved versions of his revolvers to heads of state, military officers, and celebrities such as Giuseppe Garibaldi, King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, and Hungarian rebel Lajos Kossuth. In the earliest use of product placement advertising, Colt commissioned American frontier painter George Catlin to produce a series of paintings depicting exotic scenes in which a Colt weapon was prominently used against Indians, wild animals, or bandits. He placed numerous advertisements in the same newspapers; &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot; published as many as eight in the same edition. He also hired authors to write stories about his guns for magazines and travel guides. One of Colt&#x27;s more significant acts of self-promotion was a $1,120 payment ($61,439 in 1999 dollars) to the publishers of &quot;United States Magazine&quot; for a 29-page fully illustrated story showing the inner workings of his factory.

After his revolvers had gained acceptance, Colt had his staff search for unsolicited news stories mentioning his guns that he could excerpt and reprint. He went so far as to hire agents in other states and territories to find such samples, to buy hundreds of copies for himself and to give the editor a free revolver for writing them, particularly if such a story disparaged his competition. Many of the revolvers Colt gave away as &quot;gifts&quot; had inscriptions such as &quot;Compliments of Col. Colt&quot; or &quot;From the Inventor&quot; engraved on the back straps. Later versions contained his entire signature which was used in many of his advertisements as a centerpiece, using his celebrity as a seeming guarantee of the performance of his weapons. Colt eventually secured a trademark for his signature.

One of his slogans, “God created men, Col. Colt made them equal,” (claiming that any person could, regardless of physical strength, defend themselves with a Colt gun) became a popular adage in American culture.

== Later years and death ==
In the period leading up to the American Civil War, Colt supplied both the North and the South with firearms. He had been known to sell weapons to warring parties on both sides of other conflicts in Europe and did the same with respect to the war in America. In 1859 Colt considered building an armory in the South and as late as 1861 had sold 2,000 revolvers to Confederate agent John Forsyth. Although trade with the South had not been restricted at that time, newspapers such as the &quot;New York Daily Tribune&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Hartford Daily Courant&quot; labeled him a Southern sympathizer and traitor to the Union. In response to these charges, Colt was commissioned as a colonel by the state of Connecticut on May 16, 1861, in the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles of Connecticut armed with the Colt revolving rifle. Colt envisioned this unit as being staffed by men over six feet tall and armed with his weapons. However, the unit was never deployed and Colt was discharged a month later, on June 20.
Samuel Colt died of complications of gout in Hartford on January 10, 1862. He was interred on the property of his private residence Armsmear and reinterred at Cedar Hill Cemetery in 1894. At the time of his death, Colt&#x27;s estate, which he willed to his wife and three-year-old son Caldwell Hart Colt, was estimated to be valued at about $15,000,000 (). His professional responsibilities were turned over to his brother-in-law, Richard Jarvis. The only other person mentioned in Colt&#x27;s will was Samuel Caldwell Colt, the son of his brother, John C. Colt.

Colt historian William Edwards wrote that Samuel Colt had married Caroline Henshaw (who later married his brother, John) in Scotland during 1838, and that the son she bore later was Samuel Colt&#x27;s and not his brother John&#x27;s. In a 1953 biography about Samuel Colt based largely on family letters, Edwards wrote that John Colt&#x27;s marriage to Caroline in 1841 was a way to legitimize her unborn son, as the real father, Samuel Colt, felt she was not fit to be the wife of an industrialist and divorce was a social stigma at the time. After John&#x27;s death, Samuel Colt provided financial support for the child, named Samuel Caldwell Colt, with a large allowance, and paid for his tuition in what were described as &quot;the finest private schools.&quot; In correspondence to and about his namesake, Samuel Colt referred to him as his &quot;nephew&quot; in quotes. Historians such as Edwards and Harold Schechter have said this was the elder Colt&#x27;s way of letting the world know that the boy was his own son without saying so directly. After Colt&#x27;s death, he left the boy an amount equivalent to $2 million in 2010 dollars. Colt&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth Jarvis Colt, and her brother, Richard Jarvis contested this. In probate court Caroline&#x27;s son Sam produced a valid marriage license showing that Caroline and Samuel Colt were married in Scotland in 1838 and that this document made him a rightful heir to part of Colt&#x27;s estate, if not to the Colt Manufacturing Company.

Colt was a Freemason.

== Legacy ==
It is estimated that in its first 25 years of manufacturing, Colt&#x27;s company produced more than 400,000 revolvers. Before his death, each barrel was stamped: &quot;Address Col. Samuel Colt, New York, US America&quot;, or a variation using a London address. Colt did this as New York and London were major cosmopolitan cities and he retained an office in New York at 155 Broadway where he based his salesmen.
Colt was the first American manufacturer to use art as a marketing tool when he hired Catlin to prominently display Colt firearms in his paintings. He was awarded numerous government contracts after making gifts of his highly embellished and engraved revolvers, with exotic grips such as ivory or pearl, to government officials. On a visit to what was then Constantinople, he gave a custom-engraved and gold inlaid revolver to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdülmecid I, informing him that the Russians were buying his pistols, thus securing a Turkish order for 5,000 pistols; he neglected to tell the Sultan he had used the same tactic with the Russians to elicit an order.

Apart from gifts and bribes, Colt employed an effective marketing program which comprised sales promotion, publicity, product sampling, and public relations. He used the press to his own advantage by giving revolvers to editors, prompting them to report &quot;all the accidents that occur to the Sharps &amp; other humbug arms&quot;, and listing incidents where Colt weapons had been &quot;well used against bears, Indians, Mexicans, etc&quot;. Colt&#x27;s firearms did not always fare well in standardized military tests; he preferred written testimonials from individual soldiers who used his weapons and these were what he most relied on to secure government contracts.

Colt felt that bad press was just as important as good press, provided that his name and his revolvers received mention. When he opened the London armory, he posted a 14-foot sign on the roof across from Parliament reading: &quot;Colonel Colt&#x27;s Pistol Factory&quot; as a publicity stunt, which created a stir in the British press. Eventually the British government forced him to take the sign down. Colt historian Herbert Houze wrote that Colt championed the concept of modernism before the word was coined, pioneered the use of celebrity endorsements to promote his products, introduced the phrase &quot;new and improved&quot; to advertising, and demonstrated the commercial value of brand awareness—as a word for &quot;revolver&quot; in French is &quot;le colt&quot;. Barbara M. Tucker, professor of history and director of the Center for Connecticut Studies at Eastern Connecticut State University, wrote that Colt&#x27;s marketing techniques transformed the firearm from a utilitarian object into a symbol of American identity. Tucker added that Colt associated his revolvers with American patriotism, freedom, and individualism while asserting America&#x27;s technological supremacy over Europe&#x27;s.

In 1867 Colt&#x27;s widow Elizabeth had an Episcopal church designed by Edward Tuckerman Potter built as a memorial to him and the three children they lost. The church&#x27;s architecture contains guns and gun-smithing tools sculpted in marble to commemorate Colt&#x27;s life as an arms maker. In 1896, a parish house was built on the site as a memorial to their son, Caldwell, who died in 1894. In 1975, the Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Colt established libraries and educational programs within his armories for his employees, which provided training for several generations of toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence on other manufacturing efforts over the next half century. Prominent examples included Francis A. Pratt, Amos Whitney, Henry Leland, Edward Bullard, Worcester R. Warner, Charles Brinckerhoff Richards, William Mason and Ambrose Swasey.

In 2006, Samuel Colt was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

<text>William Smith Otis (September 20, 1813 – November 13, 1839) was an American inventor of the steam shovel. Otis received a patent for his creation on February 24, 1839.
In 1839 William Smith Otis, civil engineer of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was issued a US patent for the steam shovel (No. 1,089) for excavating and (removing earth). Officially the patent drawing is missing but a drawing exists which is said to be the one from the patent and this shows the crane mounted on a railroad car. A load of earth could be lifted by the bucket, raised by the crane and turned to be dumped, such as in railcars. The patent described how a steam engine of a type then in ordinary use, was installed with a power control mechanism for the crane, and a system of pulleys to move its arms and bucket. It could move about 380 cubic meters of earth a day, with its 1.1 cubic meter capacity shovel and 180° slewing wooden jib. It was first used on the Western Railroad in Massachusetts.

Otis was born on September 20, 1813, in Pelham, Massachusetts. He was a cousin of Elisha Otis of elevator fame. At an early age, William was interested in earthworks and mechanics. At the age of 22, he had shown an uncommon mechanical ingenuity and created the first steam powered mechanical excavator.

Using materials obtained in vicinity of Canton, Massachusetts, William created the machine in 1835 which was used building railroad lines between Norwich and Worcester. Working with the company, ”Carmichael and Fairbanks”, William Smith Otis devised an apparatus carrying out the same actions as the person with a shovel.

Otis moved to Philadelphia and enlisted the talents of engineer and inventor Joseph Harrison Jr. to help construct a prototype. Harrison operated the company ”Garrett and Eastwick,&quot; and fabricated a pre-production model in 1836. On June 15, 1836, William Smith Otis received the patent for the invention; however during a fire, the engineering specifications had been destroyed.

On February 24, 1839, the patent behind number 1089 officially entered validity, and called “Crane-Excavator for Excavating and Removing Earth”.

Otis died of typhoid fever on November 13, 1839, at the age of 26.

<text>Biodiesel is a renewable biofuel, a form of diesel fuel, derived from biological sources like vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled greases, and consisting of long-chain fatty acid esters. It is typically made from fats.

The roots of biodiesel as a fuel source can be traced back to when J. Patrick and E. Duffy first conducted transesterification of vegetable oil in 1853, predating Rudolf Diesel&#x27;s development of the diesel engine. Diesel&#x27;s engine, initially designed for mineral oil, successfully ran on peanut oil at the 1900 Paris Exposition. This landmark event highlighted the potential of vegetable oils as an alternative fuel source. The interest in using vegetable oils as fuels resurfaced periodically, particularly during resource-constrained periods such as World War II. However, challenges such as high viscosity and resultant engine deposits were significant hurdles. The modern form of biodiesel emerged in the 1930s, when a method was found for transforming vegetable oils for fuel use, laying the groundwork for contemporary biodiesel production.

The physical and chemical properties of biodiesel vary depending on its source and production method. The US National Biodiesel Board defines &quot;biodiesel&quot; as a mono-alkyl ester. It has been experimented with in railway locomotives and power generators. Generally characterized by a higher boiling point and flash point than petrodiesel, biodiesel is slightly miscible with water and has distinct lubricating properties. Its calorific value is approximately 9% lower than that of standard diesel, impacting fuel efficiency. Biodiesel production has evolved significantly, with early methods including the direct use of vegetable oils, to more advanced processes like transesterification, which reduces viscosity and improves combustion properties. Notably, biodiesel production generates glycerol as a by-product, which has its own commercial applications.

Biodiesel&#x27;s primary application is in transport. There have been efforts to make it a drop-in biofuel, meaning compatible with existing diesel engines and distribution infrastructure. However, it is usually blended with petrodiesel, typically to less than 10%, since most engines cannot run on pure biodiesel without modification. The blend percentage of biodiesel is indicated by a &quot;B&quot; factor. B100 represents pure biodiesel, while blends like B20 contain 20% of biodiesel, with the remainder being traditional petrodiesel. These blends offer a compromise between the environmental benefits of biodiesel and performance characteristics of standard diesel fuel. Biodiesel blends can be used as heating oil.

The environmental impact of biodiesel is complex and varies based on factors like feedstock type, land use changes, and production methods. While it can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels, concerns about biodiesel include land use changes, deforestation, and the food vs. fuel debate. The debate centers on the impact of biodiesel production on food prices and availability, as well as its overall carbon footprint. Despite these challenges, biodiesel remains a key component in the global strategy to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

==Blends==
Blends of biodiesel and conventional hydrocarbon-based diesel are most commonly distributed for use in the retail diesel fuel marketplace. Much of the world uses a system known as the &quot;B&quot; factor to state the amount of biodiesel in any fuel mix:
* 100% biodiesel is referred to as B100
* 20% biodiesel, 80% petrodiesel is labeled B20
* 10% biodiesel, 90% petrodiesel is labeled B10
* 7% biodiesel, 93% petrodiesel is labeled B7
* 5% biodiesel, 95% petrodiesel is labeled B5
* 2% biodiesel, 98% petrodiesel is labeled B2

Blends of 20% biodiesel and lower can be used in diesel equipment with no, or only minor modifications, although certain manufacturers do not extend warranty coverage if equipment is damaged by these blends. The B6 to B20 blends are covered by the ASTM D7467 specification. Biodiesel can also be used in its pure form (B100), but may require certain engine modifications to avoid maintenance and performance problems. Blending B100 with petroleum diesel may be accomplished by:
* Mixing in tanks at manufacturing point prior to delivery to tanker truck
* Splash mixing in the tanker truck (adding specific percentages of biodiesel and petroleum diesel)
* In-line mixing, two components arrive at tanker truck simultaneously.
* Metered pump mixing, petroleum diesel and biodiesel meters are set to X total volume.

=== Technical standards ===
Biodiesel has a number of standards for its quality including European standard EN 14214, ASTM International D6751, and National Standard of Canada CAN/CGSB-3.524.

ASTM D6751 (American Society for Testing and Materials) details standards and specifications for biodiesels blended with middle distillate fuels. This specification standard specifies various test methods to be used in the determination of certain properties for biodiesel blends. Some of the tests mentioned include flash point and kinematic viscosity.

==Historical background==

Transesterification of a vegetable oil was conducted as early as 1853 by Patrick Duffy, four decades before the first diesel engine became functional. Earlier processes for making lamp oil, were patented (1810, Prague) but not published in peer-reviewed publications. Rudolf Diesel&#x27;s prime model, a single iron cylinder with a flywheel at its base, ran on its own power for the first time in Augsburg, Germany, on 10 August 1893 running on nothing but peanut oil. In remembrance of this event, 10 August has been declared &quot;International Biodiesel Day&quot;.

It is often reported that Diesel designed his engine to run on peanut oil, but this is not the case. Diesel stated in his published papers, &quot;at the Paris Exhibition in 1900 (&quot;Exposition Universelle&quot;) there was shown by the Otto Company a small Diesel engine, which, at the request of the French government ran on arachide (earth-nut or pea-nut) oil (see biodiesel), and worked so smoothly that only a few people were aware of it. The engine was constructed for using mineral oil, and was then worked on vegetable oil without any alterations being made. The French Government at the time thought of testing the applicability to power production of the Arachide, or earth-nut, which grows in considerable quantities in their African colonies, and can easily be cultivated there.&quot; Diesel himself later conducted related tests and appeared supportive of the idea. In a 1912 speech Diesel said, &quot;the use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today but such oils may become, in the course of time, as important as petroleum and the coal-tar products of the present time.&quot;

Despite the widespread use of petroleum-derived diesel fuels, interest in vegetable oils as fuels for internal combustion engines was reported in several countries during the 1920s and 30s and later during World War II. Belgium, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Japan and China were reported to have tested and used vegetable oils as diesel fuels during this time. Some operational problems were reported due to the high viscosity of vegetable oils compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which results in poor atomization of the fuel in the fuel spray and often leads to deposits and coking of the injectors, combustion chamber and valves. Attempts to overcome these problems included heating of the vegetable oil, blending it with petroleum-derived diesel fuel or ethanol, pyrolysis and cracking of the oils.

On 31 August 1937, Georges Chavanne of the University of Brussels (Belgium) was granted a patent for a &quot;Procedure for the transformation of vegetable oils for their uses as fuels&quot; (fr. &quot;Procédé de Transformation d’Huiles Végétales en Vue de Leur Utilisation comme Carburants&quot;) Belgian Patent 422,877. This patent described the alcoholysis (often referred to as transesterification) of vegetable oils using ethanol (and mentions methanol) in order to separate the fatty acids from the glycerol by replacing the glycerol with short linear alcohols. This appears to be the first account of the production of what is known as &quot;biodiesel&quot; today. This is similar (copy) to the patented methods used in the 18th century to make lamp-oil, and may be inspired by some old historical oil lamps, in some places.

More recently, in 1977, Brazilian scientist Expedito Parente invented and submitted for patent, the first industrial process for the production of biodiesel. This process is classified as biodiesel by international norms, conferring a &quot;standardized identity and quality. No other proposed biofuel has been validated by the motor industry.&quot; As of 2010, Parente&#x27;s company Tecbio is working with Boeing and NASA to certify bioquerosene (bio-kerosene), another product produced and patented by the Brazilian scientist.

Research into the use of transesterified sunflower oil, and refining it to diesel fuel standards, was initiated in South Africa in 1979. By 1983, the process for producing fuel-quality, engine-tested biodiesel was completed and published internationally. An Austrian company, Gaskoks, obtained the technology from the South African Agricultural Engineers; the company erected the first biodiesel pilot plant in November 1987, and the first industrial-scale plant in April 1989 (with a capacity of 30,000 tons of rapeseed per annum).

Throughout the 1990s, plants were opened in many European countries, including the Czech Republic, Germany and Sweden. France launched local production of biodiesel fuel (referred to as &quot;diester&quot;) from rapeseed oil, which is mixed into regular diesel fuel at a level of 5%, and into the diesel fuel used by some captive fleets (e.g. public transportation) at a level of 30%. Renault, Peugeot and other manufacturers have certified truck engines for use with up to that level of partial biodiesel; experiments with 50% biodiesel are underway. During the same period, nations in other parts of the world also saw local production of biodiesel starting up: by 1998, the Austrian Biofuels Institute had identified 21 countries with commercial biodiesel projects. 100% biodiesel is now available at many normal service stations across Europe.

==Properties==
The color of biodiesel ranges from clear to golden to dark brown, depending on the production method and the feedstock used to make the fuel. This also changes the resulting fuel properties. In general, biodiesel is slightly miscible with water, has a high boiling point and low vapor pressure. The flash point of biodiesel can exceed , significantly higher than that of petroleum diesel which may be as low as . Biodiesel has a density around ~0.88 g/cm3, higher than petrodiesel (~0.85 g/cm3).

The calorific value of biodiesel is about 37.27 MJ/kg. This is 9% lower than regular Number 2 petrodiesel. Variations in biodiesel energy density is more dependent on the feedstock used than the production process. Still, these variations are less than for petrodiesel. It has been claimed biodiesel gives better lubricity and more complete combustion thus increasing the engine energy output and partially compensating for the higher energy density of petrodiesel.

Biodiesel also contains virtually no sulfur and although lacking sulfur compounds that in petrodiesel provide much of the lubricity, it has promising lubricating properties and cetane ratings compared to low sulfur diesel fuels and often serves as an additive to ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel to aid with lubrication. Biodiesel Fuels with higher lubricity may increase the usable life of high-pressure fuel injection equipment that relies on the fuel for its lubrication. Depending on the engine, this might include high pressure injection pumps, pump injectors (also called &quot;unit injectors&quot;) and fuel injectors.

==Applications==

Biodiesel can be used in pure form (B100) or may be blended with petroleum diesel at any concentration in most injection pump diesel engines. New extreme high-pressure (29,000 psi) common rail engines have strict factory limits of B5 or B20, depending on manufacturer. Biodiesel has different solvent properties from petrodiesel, and will degrade natural rubber gaskets and hoses in vehicles (mostly vehicles manufactured before 1992), although these tend to wear out naturally and most likely will have already been replaced with FKM, which is nonreactive to biodiesel. Biodiesel has been known to break down deposits of residue in the fuel lines where petrodiesel has been used. As a result, fuel filters may become clogged with particulates if a quick transition to pure biodiesel is made. Therefore, it is recommended to change the fuel filters on engines and heaters shortly after first switching to a biodiesel blend.

===Distribution===
Since the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, biodiesel use has been increasing in the United States. In the UK, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation obliges suppliers to include 5% renewable fuel in all transport fuel sold in the UK by 2010. For road diesel, this effectively means 5% biodiesel (B5).

===Vehicular use and manufacturer acceptance===
In 2005, Chrysler (then part of DaimlerChrysler) released the Jeep Liberty CRD diesels from the factory into the European market with 5% biodiesel blends, indicating at least partial acceptance of biodiesel as an acceptable diesel fuel additive. In 2007, DaimlerChrysler indicated its intention to increase warranty coverage to 20% biodiesel blends if biofuel quality in the United States can be standardized.

The Volkswagen Group has released a statement indicating that several of its vehicles are compatible with B5 and B100 made from rape seed oil and compatible with the EN 14214 standard. The use of the specified biodiesel type in its cars will not void any warranty.

Mercedes-Benz does not allow diesel fuels containing greater than 5% biodiesel (B5) due to concerns about &quot;production shortcomings&quot;. Any damages caused by the use of such non-approved fuels will not be covered by the Mercedes-Benz Limited Warranty.

Starting in 2004, the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia decided to update its bus system to allow the fleet of city buses to run entirely on a fish-oil based biodiesel. This caused the city some initial mechanical issues, but after several years of refining, the entire fleet had successfully been converted.

In 2007, McDonald&#x27;s of UK announced it would start producing biodiesel from the waste oil byproduct of its restaurants. This fuel would be used to run its fleet.

The 2014 Chevy Cruze Clean Turbo Diesel, direct from the factory, will be rated for up to B20 (blend of 20% biodiesel / 80% regular diesel) biodiesel compatibility

===Railway usage===

British train operating company Virgin Trains West Coast claimed to have run the UK&#x27;s first &quot;biodiesel train&quot;, when a Class 220 was converted to run on 80% petrodiesel and 20% biodiesel.

The British Royal Train on 15 September 2007 completed its first ever journey run on 100% biodiesel fuel supplied by Green Fuels Ltd. Prince Charles and Green Fuels managing director James Hygate were the first passengers on a train fueled entirely by biodiesel fuel. Since 2007, the Royal Train has operated successfully on B100 (100% biodiesel). A government white paper also proposed converting large portions of the UK railways to biodiesel but the proposal was subsequently dropped in favour of further electrification.

Similarly, a state-owned short-line railroad in Eastern Washington ran a test of a 25% biodiesel / 75% petrodiesel blend during the summer of 2008, purchasing fuel from a biodiesel producer sited along the railroad tracks. The train will be powered by biodiesel made in part from canola grown in agricultural regions through which the short line runs.

Also in 2007, Disneyland began running the park trains on B98 (98% biodiesel). The program was discontinued in 2008 due to storage issues, but in January 2009, it was announced that the park would then be running all trains on biodiesel manufactured from its own used cooking oils. This is a change from running the trains on soy-based biodiesel.

In 2007, the historic Mt. Washington Cog Railway added the first biodiesel locomotive to its all-steam locomotive fleet. The fleet has climbed up the western slopes of Mount Washington in New Hampshire since 1868 with a peak vertical climb of 37.4 degrees.

In 2009, the Grand Canyon Railway started running engine 4960 on used cooking oil.

On 8 July 2014, the then Indian Railway Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda announced in Railway Budget that 5% bio-diesel will be used in Indian Railways&#x27; Diesel Engines.

===As a heating oil===

Biodiesel can also be used as a heating fuel in domestic and commercial boilers, a mix of heating oil and biofuel which is standardized and taxed slightly differently from diesel fuel used for transportation. Bioheat fuel is a proprietary blend of biodiesel and traditional heating oil. Bioheat is a registered trademark of the National Biodiesel Board [NBB] and the National Oilheat Research Alliance [NORA] in the United States, and Columbia Fuels in Canada. Heating biodiesel is available in various blends. ASTM 396 recognizes blends of up to 5 percent biodiesel as equivalent to pure petroleum heating oil. Blends of higher levels of up to 20% biofuel are used by many consumers. Research is underway to determine whether such blends affect performance.

Older furnaces may contain rubber parts that would be affected by biodiesel&#x27;s solvent properties, but can otherwise burn biodiesel without any conversion required. Care must be taken, given that varnishes left behind by petrodiesel will be released and can clog pipes—fuel filtering and prompt filter replacement is required. Another approach is to start using biodiesel as a blend, and decreasing the petroleum proportion over time can allow the varnishes to come off more gradually and be less likely to clog. Due to biodiesel&#x27;s strong solvent properties, the furnace is cleaned out and generally becomes more efficient.

A law passed under Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick requires all home heating diesel in that state to be 2% biofuel by July 1, 2010, and 5% biofuel by 2013. New York City has passed a similar law.

===Cleaning oil spills===
With 80–90% of oil spill costs invested in shoreline cleanup, there is a search for more efficient and cost-effective methods to extract oil spills from the shorelines. Biodiesel has displayed its capacity to significantly dissolve crude oil, depending on the source of the fatty acids. In a laboratory setting, oiled sediments that simulated polluted shorelines were sprayed with a single coat of biodiesel and exposed to simulated tides. Biodiesel is an effective solvent to oil due to its methyl ester component, which considerably lowers the viscosity of the crude oil. Additionally, it has a higher buoyancy than crude oil, which later aids in its removal. As a result, 80% of oil was removed from cobble and fine sand, 50% in coarse sand, and 30% in gravel. Once the oil is liberated from the shoreline, the oil-biodiesel mixture is manually removed from the water surface with skimmers. Any remaining mixture is easily broken down due to the high biodegradability of biodiesel, and the increased surface area exposure of the mixture.

===Biodiesel in generators===

In 2001, UC Riverside installed a 6-megawatt backup power system that is entirely fueled by biodiesel. Backup diesel-fueled generators allow companies to avoid damaging blackouts of critical operations at the expense of high pollution and emission rates. By using B100, these generators were able to essentially eliminate the byproducts that result in smog, ozone, and sulfur emissions. The use of these generators in residential areas around schools, hospitals, and the general public result in substantial reductions in poisonous carbon monoxide and particulate matter.

== Effects ==
===Fuel efficiency===
The power output of biodiesel depends on its blend, quality, and load conditions under which the fuel is burnt. The thermal efficiency for example of B100 as compared to B20 will vary due to the differing energy content of the various blends. Thermal efficiency of a fuel is based in part on fuel characteristics such as: viscosity, specific density, and flash point; these characteristics will change as the blends as well as the quality of biodiesel varies. The American Society for Testing and Materials has set standards in order to judge the quality of a given fuel sample.

One study found that the brake thermal efficiency of B40 was superior to traditional petroleum counterpart at higher compression ratios (this higher brake thermal efficiency was recorded at compression ratios of 21:1). It was noted that, as the compression ratios increased, the efficiency of all fuel types – as well as blends being tested – increased; though it was found that a blend of B40 was the most economical at a compression ratio of 21:1 over all other blends. The study implied that this increase in efficiency was due to fuel density, viscosity, and heating values of the fuels.

===Combustion===
Fuel systems on some modern diesel engines were not designed to accommodate biodiesel, while many heavy duty engines are able to run with biodiesel blends up to B20. Traditional direct injection fuel systems operate at roughly 3,000 psi at the injector tip while the modern common rail fuel system operates upwards of 30,000 PSI at the injector tip. Components are designed to operate at a great temperature range, from below freezing to over . Diesel fuel is expected to burn efficiently and produce as few emissions as possible. As emission standards are being introduced to diesel engines the need to control harmful emissions is being designed into the parameters of diesel engine fuel systems. The traditional inline injection system is more forgiving to poorer quality fuels as opposed to the common rail fuel system. The higher pressures and tighter tolerances of the common rail system allows for greater control over atomization and injection timing. This control of atomization as well as combustion allows for greater efficiency of modern diesel engines as well as greater control over emissions. Components within a diesel fuel system interact with the fuel in a way to ensure efficient operation of the fuel system and so the engine. If an out-of-specification fuel is introduced to a system that has specific parameters of operation, then the integrity of the overall fuel system may be compromised. Some of these parameters such as spray pattern and atomization are directly related to injection timing.

One study found that during atomization, biodiesel and its blends produced droplets greater in diameter than the droplets produced by traditional petrodiesel. The smaller droplets were attributed to the lower viscosity and surface tension of traditional diesel fuel. It was found that droplets at the periphery of the spray pattern were larger in diameter than the droplets at the center. This was attributed to the faster pressure drop at the edge of the spray pattern; there was a proportional relationship between the droplet size and the distance from the injector tip. It was found that B100 had the greatest spray penetration, this was attributed to the greater density of B100. Having a greater droplet size can lead to inefficiencies in the combustion, increased emissions, and decreased horse power. In another study it was found that there is a short injection delay when injecting biodiesel. This injection delay was attributed to the greater viscosity of Biodiesel. It was noted that the higher viscosity and the greater cetane rating of biodiesel over traditional petrodiesel lead to poor atomization, as well as mixture penetration with air during the ignition delay period. Another study noted that this ignition delay may aid in a decrease of emission.

===Emissions===
Emissions are inherent to the combustion of diesel fuels that are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). As these emissions are a byproduct of the combustion process, in order to ensure E.P.A. compliance a fuel system must be capable of controlling the combustion of fuels as well as the mitigation of emissions. There are a number of new technologies being phased in to control the production of diesel emissions. The exhaust gas recirculation system, E.G.R., and the diesel particulate filter, D.P.F., are both designed to mitigate the production of harmful emissions.

The feedstock used to make the biodiesel fuel can significantly alter the resulting exhaust gas and particulate matter emissions, even when blended with commercial diesel fuel. A study performed by the Chonbuk National University concluded that a B30 biodiesel blend reduced carbon monoxide emissions by approximately 83% and particulate matter emissions by roughly 33%. emissions, however, were found to increase without the application of an E.G.R. system. The study also concluded that, with E.G.R, a B20 biodiesel blend considerably reduced the emissions of the engine. Additionally, analysis by the California Air Resources Board found that biodiesel had the lowest carbon emissions of the fuels tested, those being ultra-low-sulfur diesel, gasoline, corn-based ethanol, compressed natural gas, and five types of biodiesel from varying feedstocks. Their conclusions also showed great variance in carbon emissions of biodiesel based on the feedstock used. Of soy, tallow, canola, corn, and used cooking oil, soy showed the highest carbon emissions, while used cooking oil produced the lowest.

While studying the effect of biodiesel on diesel particulate filters, it was found that though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided in the catalytic conversion of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. This may cause the filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas recirculation but levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system.

As of 2017, blended biodiesel fuels (especially B5, B8, and B20) are regularly used in many heavy-duty vehicles, especially transit buses in US cities. Characterization of exhaust emissions showed significant emission reductions compared to regular diesel.

===Material compatibility===
* Plastics: High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is compatible but polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is slowly degraded. Polystyrene is dissolved on contact with biodiesel.
* Metals: Biodiesel (like methanol) has an effect on copper-based materials (e.g. brass), and it also affects zinc, tin, lead, and cast iron. Stainless steels (316 and 304) and aluminum are unaffected.
* Rubber: Biodiesel also affects types of natural rubbers found in some older engine components. Studies have also found that fluorinated elastomers (FKM) cured with peroxide and base-metal oxides can be degraded when biodiesel loses its stability caused by oxidation. Commonly used synthetic rubbers FKM- GBL-S and FKM- GF-S found in modern vehicles were found to handle biodiesel in all conditions.

== Production ==
Biodiesel is commonly produced by the transesterification of the vegetable oil or animal fat feedstock, and other non-edible raw materials such as frying oil, etc. There are several methods for carrying out this transesterification reaction including the common batch process, heterogeneous catalysts, supercritical processes, ultrasonic methods, and even microwave methods.

Chemically, transesterified biodiesel comprises a mix of mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids. The most common form uses methanol (converted to sodium methoxide) to produce methyl esters (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Methyl Ester – FAME) as it is the cheapest alcohol available, though ethanol can be used to produce an ethyl ester (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester – FAEE) biodiesel and higher alcohols such as isopropanol and butanol have also been used. Using alcohols of higher molecular weights improves the cold flow properties of the resulting ester, at the cost of a less efficient transesterification reaction. A lipid transesterification production process is used to convert the base oil to the desired esters. Any free fatty acids (FFAs) in the base oil are either converted to soap and removed from the process, or they are esterified (yielding more biodiesel) using an acidic catalyst. After this processing, unlike straight vegetable oil, biodiesel has combustion properties very similar to those of petroleum diesel, and can replace it in most current uses.

The methanol used in most biodiesel production processes is made using fossil fuel inputs. However, there are sources of renewable methanol made using carbon dioxide or biomass as feedstock, making their production processes free of fossil fuels.

A by-product of the transesterification process is the production of glycerol. For every 1 tonne of biodiesel that is manufactured, 100 kg of glycerol are produced. Originally, there was a valuable market for the glycerol, which assisted the economics of the process as a whole. However, with the increase in global biodiesel production, the market price for this crude glycerol (containing 20% water and catalyst residues) has crashed. Research is being conducted globally to use this glycerol as a chemical building block (see chemical intermediate under Wikipedia article &quot;Glycerol&quot;). One initiative in the UK is The Glycerol Challenge.

Usually this crude glycerol has to be purified, typically by performing vacuum distillation. This is rather energy intensive. The refined glycerol (98%+ purity) can then be utilised directly, or converted into other products. The following announcements were made in 2007: A joint venture of Ashland Inc. and Cargill announced plans to make propylene glycol in Europe from glycerol and Dow Chemical announced similar plans for North America. Dow also plans to build a plant in China to make epichlorhydrin from glycerol. Epichlorhydrin is a raw material for epoxy resins.

Global biodiesel production reached 3.8 million tons in 2005. Approximately 85% of biodiesel production came from the European Union.

===Production levels===

In 2007, biodiesel production capacity was growing rapidly, with an average annual growth rate from 2002 to 2006 of over 40%. For the year 2006, the latest for which actual production figures could be obtained, total world biodiesel production was about 5–6 million tonnes, with 4.9 million tonnes processed in Europe (of which 2.7 million tonnes was from Germany) and most of the rest from the US. In 2008 production in Europe alone had risen to 7.8 million tonnes. In July 2009, a duty was added to American imported biodiesel in the European Union in order to balance the competition from European, especially German producers. The capacity for 2008 in Europe totalled 16 million tonnes. This compares with a total demand for diesel in the US and Europe of approximately 490 million tonnes (147 billion gallons). Total world production of vegetable oil for all purposes in 2005–06 was about 110 million tonnes, with about 34 million tonnes each of palm oil and soybean oil. As of 2018, Indonesia is the world&#x27;s top supplier of palmoil-based biofuel with annual production of 3.5 million tons, and expected to export about 1 million tonnes of biodiesel.

US biodiesel production in 2011 brought the industry to a new milestone. Under the EPA Renewable Fuel Standard, targets have been implemented for the biodiesel production plants in order to monitor and document production levels in comparison to total demand. According to the year-end data released by the EPA, biodiesel production in 2011 reached more than 1 billion gallons. This production number far exceeded the 800 million gallon target set by the EPA. The projected production for 2020 is nearly 12 billion gallons.

===Biodiesel feedstocks===
A variety of oils can be used to produce biodiesel. These include:

* Virgin oil feedstock – rapeseed and soybean oils are most commonly used, soybean oil accounting for about half of U.S. production. It also can be obtained from Pongamia, field pennycress and jatropha and other crops such as mustard, jojoba, flax, sunflower, palm oil, coconut and hemp (see list of vegetable oils for biofuel for more information);
* Waste vegetable oil (WVO);
* Animal fats including tallow, lard, yellow grease, chicken fat, and the by-products of the production of Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil.
* Algae, which can be grown using waste materials such as sewage and without displacing land currently used for food production.
* Oil from halophytes such as &quot;Salicornia bigelovii&quot;, which can be grown using saltwater in coastal areas where conventional crops cannot be grown, with yields equal to the yields of soybeans and other oilseeds grown using freshwater irrigation
* Sewage Sludge – The sewage-to-biofuel field is attracting interest from major companies like Waste Management and startups like InfoSpi, which are betting that renewable sewage biodiesel can become competitive with petroleum diesel on price.

Many advocates suggest that waste vegetable oil is the best source of oil to produce biodiesel, but since the available supply is drastically less than the amount of petroleum-based fuel that is burned for transportation and home heating in the world, this local solution could not scale to the current rate of consumption.

Animal fats are a by-product of meat production and cooking. Although it would not be efficient to raise animals (or catch fish) simply for their fat, use of the by-product adds value to the livestock industry (hogs, cattle, poultry). Today, multi-feedstock biodiesel facilities are producing high quality animal-fat based biodiesel. Currently, a 5-million dollar plant is being built in the US, with the intent of producing 11.4 million litres (3 million gallons) biodiesel from some of the estimated 1 billion kg (2.2 billion pounds) of chicken fat produced annually at the local Tyson poultry plant. Similarly, some small-scale biodiesel factories use waste fish oil as feedstock. An EU-funded project (ENERFISH) suggests that at a Vietnamese plant to produce biodiesel from catfish (basa, also known as pangasius), an output of 13 tons/day of biodiesel can be produced from 81 tons of fish waste (in turn resulting from 130 tons of fish). This project utilises the biodiesel to fuel a CHP unit in the fish processing plant, mainly to power the fish freezing plant.

====Quantity of feedstocks required====
Current worldwide production of vegetable oil and animal fat is not sufficient to replace liquid fossil fuel use. Furthermore, some object to the vast amount of farming and the resulting fertilization, pesticide use, and land use conversion that would be needed to produce the additional vegetable oil. The advantages of algae are that it can be grown on non-arable land such as deserts or in marine environments, and the potential oil yields are much higher than from plants.

===Yield===
Feedstock yield efficiency per unit area affects the feasibility of ramping up production to the huge industrial levels required to power a significant percentage of vehicles.

Algae fuel yields have not yet been accurately determined, but DOE is reported as saying that algae yield 30 times more energy per acre than land crops such as soybeans. Yields of 36 tonnes/hectare are considered practical by Ami Ben-Amotz of the Institute of Oceanography in Haifa, who has been farming Algae commercially for over 20 years.

Jatropha has been cited as a high-yield source of biodiesel but yields are highly dependent on climatic and soil conditions. The estimates at the low end put the yield at about 200 US gal/acre (1.5-2 tonnes per hectare) per crop; in more favorable climates two or more crops per year have been achieved. It is grown in the Philippines, Mali and India, is drought-resistant, and can share space with other cash crops such as coffee, sugar, fruits and vegetables. It is well-suited to semi-arid lands and can contribute to slow down desertification, according to its advocates.

=== Efficiency and economic arguments ===
Transitioning fully to biofuels could require immense tracts of land if traditional food crops are used (although non food crops can be utilized). The problem would be especially severe for nations with large economies, since energy consumption scales with economic output.

For third world countries, biodiesel sources that use marginal land could make more sense; e.g., pongam oiltree nuts grown along roads or jatropha grown along rail lines.

In tropical regions, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, plants that produce palm oil are being planted at a rapid pace to supply growing biodiesel demand in Europe and other markets. Scientists have shown that the removal of rainforest for palm plantations is not ecologically sound since the expansion of oil palm plantations poses a threat to natural rainforest and biodiversity.

It has been estimated in Germany that palm oil diesel has less than one third of the production costs of rapeseed biodiesel.

In the US, the production of biodiesel was reported in 2018 to support more than 64,000 jobs. The growth in biodiesel also helps significantly increase GDP. In 2011, biodiesel created more than $3 billion in GDP.

==Energy security==
One of the main drivers for adoption of biodiesel is energy security. This means that a nation&#x27;s dependence on oil is reduced, and substituted with use of locally available sources, such as coal, gas, or renewable sources. Thus a country can benefit from adoption of biofuels, without a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. While the total energy balance is debated, it is clear that the dependence on oil is reduced. One example is the energy used to manufacture fertilizers, which could come from a variety of sources other than petroleum. The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) states that energy security is the number one driving force behind the US biofuels programme, and a White House &quot;Energy Security for the 21st Century&quot; paper makes it clear that energy security is a major reason for promoting biodiesel. The former EU commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, speaking at a recent EU biofuels conference, stressed that properly managed biofuels have the potential to reinforce the EU&#x27;s security of supply through diversification of energy sources.

== Global biofuel policies ==

Many countries around the world are involved in the growing use and production of biofuels, such as biodiesel, as an alternative energy source to fossil fuels and oil. To foster the biofuel industry, governments have implemented legislations and laws as incentives to reduce oil dependency and to increase the use of renewable energies. Many countries have their own independent policies regarding the taxation and rebate of biodiesel use, import, and production.

=== Canada ===

It was required by the Canadian Environmental Protection Act Bill C-33 that by 2010, gasoline contained 5% renewable content and that by 2013, diesel and heating oil contained 2% renewable content. The EcoENERGY for Biofuels Program subsidized the production of biodiesel, among other biofuels, via an incentive rate of CAN$0.20 per liter from 2008 to 2010. A decrease of $0.04 will be applied every year following, until the incentive rate reaches $0.06 in 2016. Individual provinces also have specific legislative measures in regards to biofuel use and production.

=== United States ===

The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) was the main source of financial support for biofuels, but was scheduled to expire in 2010. Through this act, biodiesel production guaranteed a tax credit of US$1 per gallon produced from virgin oils, and $0.50 per gallon made from recycled oils.
Currently soybean oil is being used to produce soybean biodiesel for many commercial purposes such as blending fuel for transportation sectors.

=== European Union ===

The European Union is the greatest producer of biodiesel, with France and Germany being the top producers. To increase the use of biodiesel, there are policies requiring the blending of biodiesel into fuels, including penalties if those rates are not reached. In France, the goal was to reach 10% integration but plans for that stopped in 2010. As an incentive for the European Union countries to continue the production of the biofuel, there are tax rebates for specific quotas of biofuel produced. In Germany, the minimum percentage of biodiesel in transport diesel is set at 7% so called &quot;B7&quot;.

=== Malaysia ===
Malaysia plans to implement its nationwide adoption of the B20 palm oil biofuel programme by the end of 2022. The mandate to manufacture biofuel with a 20% palm oil component - known as B20 - for the transport sector was first rolled out in January 2020 but faced delays due to movement curbs imposed to contain coronavirus outbreaks.

== Issues and concerns ==

=== Food, land and water vs. fuel ===

Up to 40% of corn produced in the United States is used to make ethanol, and worldwide 10% of all grain is turned into biofuel. A 50% reduction in grain used for biofuels in the US and Europe would replace all of Ukraine&#x27;s grain exports.

In some poor countries the rising price of vegetable oil is causing problems. Some propose that fuel only be made from non-edible vegetable oils such as camelina, jatropha or seashore mallow which can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops will not grow, or would produce only low yields.

Others argue that the problem is more fundamental. Farmers may switch from producing food crops to producing biofuel crops to make more money, even if the new crops are not edible. The law of supply and demand predicts that if fewer farmers are producing food the price of food will rise. It may take some time, as farmers can take some time to change which things they are growing, but increasing demand for first generation biofuels is likely to result in price increases for many kinds of food. Some have pointed out that there are poor farmers and poor countries who are making more money because of the higher price of vegetable oil.

Biodiesel from sea algae would not necessarily displace terrestrial land currently used for food production and new algaculture jobs could be created.

By comparison it should be mentioned that the production of biogas utilizes agricultural waste to generate a biofuel known as biogas, and also produces compost, thereby enhancing agriculture, sustainability and food production.

=== Environmental impact of biodiesel ===

The surge of interest in biodiesels has highlighted a number of environmental effects associated with its use. These potentially include reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, pollution and the rate of biodegradation.

According to the Renewable Fuel Standards Program Regulatory Impact Analysis, released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States in February 2010, biodiesel from soy oil results, on average, in a 57% reduction in greenhouse gases compared to petroleum diesel, and biodiesel produced from waste grease results in an 86% reduction. See chapter 2.6 of the EPA report for more detailed information.

However, environmental organizations, for example, Rainforest Rescue and Greenpeace, criticize the cultivation of plants used for biodiesel production, e.g., oil palms, soybeans and sugar cane. The deforestation of rainforests exacerbates climate change and sensitive ecosystems are destroyed to clear land for oil palm, soybean and sugar cane plantations. Moreover, that biofuels contribute to world hunger, since arable land is no longer used for growing foods. The Environmental Protection Agency published data in January 2012, showing that biofuels made from palm oil will not count towards the renewable fuels mandate of the United States as they are not climate-friendly. Environmentalists welcome the conclusion because the growth of oil palm plantations has driven tropical deforestation, for example, in Indonesia and Malaysia.

Indonesia produces biodiesel primarily from palm oil. Since agricultural land is limited, in order to plant monocultures of oil palms, land used for other cultivations or the tropical forest need to be cleared. A major environmental threat is then the destruction of rainforests in Indonesia.

The environmental impact of biodiesel is diverse and not clearcut. An often mentioned incentive for using biodiesel is its capacity to lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to those of fossil fuels. Whether this is true or not depends on many factors.

==== Greenhouse gas emissions ====


A general critique against biodiesel is the land use change, which have potential to cause even more emissions than what would be caused by using fossil fuels alone. Yet this problem would be fixed with algal biofuel which can use land unsuitable for agriculture.

Carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases. Although the burning of biodiesel produces carbon dioxide emissions similar to those from ordinary fossil fuels, the plant feedstock used in the production absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere when it grows. Plants absorb carbon dioxide through a process known as photosynthesis which allows it to store energy from sunlight in the form of sugars and starches. After the biomass is converted into biodiesel and burned as fuel the energy and carbon is released again. Some of that energy can be used to power an engine while the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere.

When considering the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions it is therefore important to consider the whole production process and what indirect effects such production might cause. The effect on carbon dioxide emissions is highly dependent on production methods and the type of feedstock used. Calculating the carbon intensity of biofuels is a complex and inexact process, and is highly dependent on the assumptions made in the calculation. A calculation usually includes:

* Emissions from growing the feedstock (e.g. Petrochemicals used in fertilizers)
* Emissions from transporting the feedstock to the factory
* Emissions from processing the feedstock into biodiesel
* Absorption of CO2 Emissions from growing the feedstock
Other factors can be very significant but are sometimes not considered. These include:
* Emissions from the change in land use of the area where the fuel feedstock is grown.
* Emissions from transportation of the biodiesel from the factory to its point of use
* The efficiency of the biodiesel compared with standard diesel
* The amount of Carbon Dioxide produced at the tail pipe. (Biodiesel can produce 4.7% more)
* The benefits due to the production of useful by-products, such as cattle feed or glycerine

If land use change is not considered and assuming today&#x27;s production methods, biodiesel from rapeseed and sunflower oil produce 45%-65% lower greenhouse gas emissions than petrodiesel. However, there is ongoing research to improve the efficiency of the production process. Biodiesel produced from used cooking oil or other waste fat could reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 85%. As long as the feedstock is grown on existing cropland, land use change has little or no effect on greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is concern that increased feedstock production directly affects the rate of deforestation. Such clearcutting cause carbon stored in the forest, soil and peat layers to be released. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation is so large that the benefits from lower emissions (caused by biodiesel use alone) would be negligible for hundreds of years. Biofuel produced from feedstock such as palm oil could therefore cause much higher carbon dioxide emissions than some types of fossil fuels.

==== Pollution ====
In the United States, biodiesel is the only alternative fuel to have successfully completed the Health Effects Testing requirements (Tier I and Tier II) of the Clean Air Act (1990).

Biodiesel can reduce the direct tailpipe-emission of particulates, small particles of solid combustion products, on vehicles with particulate filters by as much as 20 percent compared with low-sulfur (&lt; 50 ppm) diesel. Particulate emissions as the result of production are reduced by around 50 percent compared with fossil-sourced diesel.

==== Biodegradation ====
A University of Idaho study compared biodegradation rates of biodiesel, neat vegetable oils, biodiesel and petroleum diesel blends, and neat 2-D diesel fuel. Using low concentrations of the product to be degraded (10 ppm) in nutrient and sewage sludge amended solutions, they demonstrated that biodiesel degraded at the same rate as a dextrose control and 5 times as quickly as petroleum diesel over a period of 28 days, and that biodiesel blends doubled the rate of petroleum diesel degradation through co-metabolism.
The same study examined soil degradation using 10 000 ppm of biodiesel and petroleum diesel, and found biodiesel degraded at twice the rate of petroleum diesel in soil. In all cases, it was determined biodiesel also degraded more completely than petroleum diesel, which produced poorly degradable undetermined intermediates. Toxicity studies for the same project demonstrated no mortalities and few toxic effects on rats and rabbits with up to 5000 mg/kg of biodiesel. Petroleum diesel showed no mortalities at the same concentration either; however, toxic effects such as hair loss and urinary discolouring were noted with concentrations of &gt;2000 mg/L in rabbits.:

===== In aquatic environments =====
As biodiesel becomes more widely used, it is important to consider how consumption affects water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Research examining the biodegradability of different biodiesel fuels found that all of the biofuels studied (including Neat Rapeseed oil, Neat Soybean oil, and their modified ester products) were “readily biodegradable” compounds, and had a relatively high biodegradation rate in water. Additionally, the presence of biodiesel can increase the rate of diesel biodegradation via co-metabolism. As the ratio of biodiesel is increased in biodiesel/diesel mixtures, the faster the diesel is degraded. Another study using controlled experimental conditions also showed that fatty acid methyl esters, the primary molecules in biodiesel, degraded much faster than petroleum diesel in sea water.

==== Carbonyl emissions ====
When considering the emissions from fossil fuel and biofuel use, research typically focuses on major pollutants such as hydrocarbons. It is generally recognized that using biodiesel in place of diesel results in a substantial reduction in regulated gas emissions, but there has been a lack of information in research literature about the non-regulated compounds which also play a role in air pollution. One study focused on the emissions of non-criteria carbonyl compounds from the burning of pure diesel and biodiesel blends in heavy-duty diesel engines. The results found that carbonyl emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde, were higher in biodiesel mixtures than emissions from pure diesel. Biodiesel use results in higher carbonyl emissions but lower total hydrocarbon emissions, which may be better as an alternative fuel source. Other studies have been done which conflict with these results, but comparisons are difficult to make due to various factors that differ between studies (such as types of fuel and engines used). In a paper which compared 12 research articles on carbonyl emissions from biodiesel fuel use, it found that 8 of the papers reported increased carbonyl compound emissions while 4 showed the opposite. This is evidence that there is still much research required on these compounds.

=== Mechanical concerns ===
==== Engine wear ====
Lubricity of fuel plays an important role in wear that occurs in an engine. A diesel engine relies on its fuel to provide lubricity for the metal components that are constantly in contact with each other. Biodiesel is a much better lubricant compared with fossil petroleum diesel due to the presence of esters. Tests have shown that the addition of a small amount of biodiesel to diesel can significantly increase the lubricity of the fuel in short term. However, over a longer period of time (2–4 years), studies show that biodiesel loses its lubricity. This could be because of enhanced corrosion over time due to oxidation of the unsaturated molecules or increased water content in biodiesel from moisture absorption.

==== Fuel viscosity ====
One of the main concerns regarding biodiesel is its viscosity. The viscosity of diesel is 2.5–3.2 cSt at 40 °C and the viscosity of biodiesel made from soybean oil is between 4.2 and 4.6 cSt The viscosity of diesel must be high enough to provide sufficient lubrication for the engine parts but low enough to flow at operational temperature. High viscosity can plug the fuel filter and injection system in engines. Vegetable oil is composed of lipids with long chains of hydrocarbons, to reduce its viscosity the lipids are broken down into smaller molecules of esters. This is done by converting vegetable oil and animal fats into alkyl esters using transesterification to reduce their viscosity Nevertheless, biodiesel viscosity remains higher than that of diesel, and the engine may not be able to use the fuel at low temperatures due to the slow flow through the fuel filter.

==== Engine performance ====
Biodiesel has higher brake-specific fuel consumption compared to diesel, which means more biodiesel fuel consumption is required for the same torque. However, B20 biodiesel blend has been found to provide maximum increase in thermal efficiency, lowest brake-specific energy consumption, and lower harmful emissions. The engine performance depends on the properties of the fuel, as well as on combustion, injector pressure and many other factors. Since there are various blends of biodiesel, that may account for the contradicting reports as regards engine performance.

==== Exhaust emissions ====
The feedstock used to make the biodiesel alters the fuel’s properties by changing the average carbon chain length and number of double bonds present in the fatty acid methyl esters.

==== Low-temperature gelling ====
When biodiesel is cooled below a certain point, some of the molecules aggregate and form crystals. The fuel starts to appear cloudy once the crystals become larger than one quarter of the wavelengths of visible light – this is the cloud point (CP). As the fuel is cooled further these crystals become larger. The lowest temperature at which fuel can pass through a 45 micrometre filter is the cold filter plugging point (CFPP). As biodiesel is cooled further it will gel and then solidify. Within Europe, there are differences in the CFPP requirements between countries. This is reflected in the different national standards of those countries. The temperature at which pure (B100) biodiesel starts to gel varies significantly and depends upon the mix of esters and therefore the feedstock oil used to produce the biodiesel. For example, biodiesel produced from low erucic acid varieties of canola seed (RME) starts to gel at approximately . Biodiesel produced from beef tallow and palm oil tends to gel at around and respectively. There are a number of commercially available additives that will significantly lower the pour point and cold filter plugging point of pure biodiesel. Winter operation is also possible by blending biodiesel with other fuel oils including #2 low sulfur diesel fuel and #1 diesel / kerosene.

Another approach to facilitate the use of biodiesel in cold conditions is by employing a second fuel tank for biodiesel in addition to the standard diesel fuel tank. The second fuel tank can be insulated and a heating coil using engine coolant is run through the tank. The fuel tanks can be switched over when the fuel is sufficiently warm. A similar method can be used to operate diesel vehicles using straight vegetable oil.

==== Contamination by water ====
Biodiesel may contain small but problematic quantities of water. Although it is only slightly miscible with water it is hygroscopic. One of the reasons biodiesel can absorb water is the persistence of mono and diglycerides left over from an incomplete reaction. These molecules can act as an emulsifier, allowing water to mix with the biodiesel. In addition, there may be water that is residual to processing or resulting from storage tank condensation. The presence of water is a problem because:
* Water reduces the heat of fuel combustion, causing smoke, harder starting, and reduced power.
* Water causes corrosion of fuel system components (pumps, fuel lines, etc.)
* Microbes in water cause the paper-element filters in the system to rot and fail, causing failure of the fuel pump due to ingestion of large particles.
* Water freezes to form ice crystals that provide sites for nucleation, accelerating gelling of the fuel.
* Water causes pitting in pistons.

Previously, the amount of water contaminating biodiesel has been difficult to measure by taking samples, since water and oil separate. However, it is now possible to measure the water content using water-in-oil sensors.

Water contamination is also a potential problem when using certain chemical catalysts involved in the production process, substantially reducing catalytic efficiency of base (high pH) catalysts such as potassium hydroxide. However, the super-critical methanol production methodology, whereby the transesterification process of oil feedstock and methanol is effectuated under high temperature and pressure, has been shown to be largely unaffected by the presence of water contamination during the production phase

==Research==
There was research into finding more suitable crops and improving oil yield. Other sources are possible including human fecal matter, with Ghana building its first &quot;fecal sludge-fed biodiesel plant.&quot;

Specially bred mustard varieties can produce reasonably high oil yields and are very useful in crop rotation with cereals, and have the added benefit that the meal leftover after the oil has been pressed out can act as an effective and biodegradable pesticide.

The NFESC, with Santa Barbara-based Biodiesel Industries is working to develop biodiesel technologies for the US navy and military, one of the largest diesel fuel users in the world.

A group of Spanish developers working for a company called Ecofasa announced a new biofuel made from trash. The fuel is created from general urban waste which is treated by bacteria to produce fatty acids, which can be used to make biodiesel.

Another approach that does not require the use of chemical for the production involves the use of genetically modified microbes.

===Algal biodiesel===
From 1978 to 1996, the U.S. NREL experimented with using algae as a biodiesel source in the &quot;Aquatic Species Program&quot;.
A self-published article by Michael Briggs, at the UNH Biodiesel Group, offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all vehicular fuel with biodiesel by utilizing algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants. This oil-rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biodiesel, with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol.

The production of algae to harvest oil for biodiesel has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale, but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield, algaculture — unlike crop-based biofuels — does not entail a decrease in food production, since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water. Many companies are pursuing algae bio-reactors for various purposes, including scaling up biodiesel production to commercial levels.
Biodiesel lipids could be extracted from wet algae using a simple and economical reaction in ionic liquids.

===Pongamia===

&quot;Millettia pinnata&quot;, also known as the Pongam Oiltree or Pongamia, is a leguminous, oilseed-bearing tree that has been identified as a candidate for non-edible vegetable oil production.

Pongamia plantations for biodiesel production have a two-fold environmental benefit. The trees both store carbon and produce fuel oil. Pongamia grows on marginal land not fit for food crops and does not require nitrate fertilizers. The oil producing tree has the highest yield of oil producing plant (approximately 40% by weight of the seed is oil) while growing in malnourished soils with high levels of salt. It is becoming a main focus in a number of biodiesel research organizations. The main advantages of Pongamia are a higher recovery and quality of oil than other crops and no direct competition with food crops. However, growth on marginal land can lead to lower oil yields which could cause competition with food crops for better soil.

===Jatropha===


Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on &quot;Jatropha curcas&quot;, a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biodiesel feedstock oil. Much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of Jatropha through advancements in genetics, soil science, and horticultural practices.

SG Biofuels, a San Diego-based Jatropha developer, has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds of Jatropha that show significant yield improvements over first generation varieties. SG Biofuels also claims that additional benefits have arisen from such strains, including improved flowering synchronicity, higher resistance to pests and disease, and increased cold weather tolerance.

Plant Research International, a department of the Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, maintains an ongoing Jatropha Evaluation Project (JEP) that examines the feasibility of large scale Jatropha cultivation through field and laboratory experiments.

The Center for Sustainable Energy Farming (CfSEF) is a Los Angeles-based non-profit research organization dedicated to Jatropha research in the areas of plant science, agronomy, and horticulture. Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase Jatropha farm production yields by 200–300% in the next ten years.

=== FOG from sewage ===
So-called fats, oils and grease (FOG), recovered from sewage can also be turned into biodiesel.

===Fungi===
A group at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow published a paper in 2008, stating that they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biodiesel in an economically efficient manner.

The recent discovery of a variant of the fungus &quot;Gliocladium roseum&quot; points toward the production of so-called myco-diesel from cellulose. This organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern Patagonia and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel.

===Biodiesel from used coffee grounds===
Researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno, have successfully produced biodiesel from oil derived from used coffee grounds. Their analysis of the used grounds showed a 10% to 15% oil content (by weight). Once the oil was extracted, it underwent conventional processing into biodiesel. It is estimated that finished biodiesel could be produced for about one US dollar per gallon. Further, it was reported that &quot;the technique is not difficult&quot; and that &quot;there is so much coffee around that several hundred million gallons of biodiesel could potentially be made annually.&quot; However, even if all the coffee grounds in the world were used to make fuel, the amount produced would be less than 1 percent of the diesel used in the United States annually. &quot;It won’t solve the world’s energy problem,&quot; Dr. Misra said of his work.

=== Biodiesel to hydrogen-cell power ===
A microreactor has been developed to convert biodiesel into hydrogen steam to power fuel cells.

Steam reforming, also known as fossil fuel reforming is a process which produces hydrogen gas from hydrocarbon fuels, most notably biodiesel due to its efficiency. A **microreactor**, or reformer, is the processing device in which water vapour reacts with the liquid fuel under high temperature and pressure. Under temperatures ranging from 700 – 1100 °C, a nickel-based catalyst enables the production of carbon monoxide and hydrogen:

&quot; Hydrocarbon + ⇌ CO + 3 (Highly endothermic)&quot;

Furthermore, a higher yield of hydrogen gas can be harnessed by further oxidizing carbon monoxide to produce more hydrogen and carbon dioxide:

&quot; CO + → + (Mildly exothermic)&quot;

===Safflower oil===
, researchers at Australia&#x27;s CSIRO have been studying safflower oil from a specially-bred variety as an engine lubricant, and researchers at Montana State University&#x27;s Advanced Fuel Centre in the US have been studying the oil&#x27;s performance in a large diesel engine, with results described as a &quot;game-changer&quot;.

<text>A light cruiser is a type of small or medium-sized warship. The term is a shortening of the phrase &quot;light armored cruiser&quot;, describing a small ship that carried armor in the same way as an armored cruiser: a protective belt and deck. Prior to this smaller cruisers had been of the protected cruiser model, possessing armored decks only. While lighter and smaller than other contemporary ships they were still true cruisers, retaining the extended radius of action and self-sufficiency to act independently around the world. Cruisers mounting larger guns and heavier armor relative to most light cruisers would come to be known as heavy cruisers, though the designation of &#x27;light&#x27; versus &#x27;heavy&#x27; cruisers would vary somewhat between navies. Through their history light cruisers served in a variety of roles, primarily as convoy escorts and destroyer command ships, but also as scouts and fleet support vessels for battle fleets.

==Origins and development==
The first small steam-powered cruisers were built for the British Royal Navy with HMS &quot;Mercury&quot; launched in 1878. Such second and third class protected cruisers evolved, gradually becoming faster, better armed and better protected. Germany took a lead in small cruiser design in the 1890s, building a class of fast cruisers—the —copied by other nations. Such vessels were powered by coal-fired boilers and reciprocating steam engines and relied in part on the arrangement of coal bunkers for their protection. The adoption of oil-fired water-tube boilers and steam turbine engines meant that older small cruisers rapidly became obsolete. Furthermore, new construction could not rely on the protection of coal bunkers and would therefore have to adopt some form of side armoring. The British &quot;Chatham&quot; group of cruisers were a departure from previous designs; with turbine propulsion, mixed coal and oil firing and a 2-inch protective armored belt as well as deck. Thus, by definition, they were armored cruisers, despite displacing only 4,800 tons; the light armored cruiser had arrived. The first true modern light cruisers were the which had all oil-firing and used lightweight destroyer-type machinery to make .

==History==
===World War I===
By World War I, British light cruisers often had either two and perhaps eight guns, or a uniform armament of 6-inch guns on a ship of around 5,000 tons, while German light cruisers progressed during the war from to guns. Cruiser construction in Britain continued uninterrupted until Admiral &quot;Jacky&quot; Fisher&#x27;s appointment as First Sea Lord in 1904. Due in part to the desire to curtail excess expenditures in light of the increasing cost of keeping up with German naval production and in part because he felt the type to be outdated, Fisher authorized few new cruisers and scrapped 70 older ones. Fisher&#x27;s belief that battlecruisers would take the place of light cruisers to protect commercial shipping soon proved impractical, as their high construction cost precluded their availability in sufficient numbers to do so, and destroyers were too small for scouting duties. The group of 21 cruisers begun in 1910 proved excellent in scouting in all types of weather and could carry enough fuel and ammunition to guard the shipping lanes. The , launched three years later, was also successful. British designers continued enlarging and refining subsequent cruiser designs throughout the war. The C class ships were started in 1913, and of these, HMS Caroline remains - the only extant survivor of the Battle of Jutland.
The Germans built a number of light cruisers in the belief that they were good multi-purpose vessels. Unlike the British, who built both long-range cruisers like the Town class for commerce protection and short-range &quot;scout&quot; cruisers for fleet support, the Germans built a single series of light cruisers for both functions. Compared to the British &quot;scout&quot; type the German ships were bigger, slower and less manoeuvrable but, through a successive series of classes, improved consistently in seagoing qualities. However, the Germans were very late in adapting 5.9-inch guns (not doing so until the of 1913); Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz&#x27;s recalcitrance over the issue overrode the desires of others in the German Navy. For about a three-year period after the British &quot;Weymouth&quot; class of the Town series, completed with a uniform armament of 6-inch guns, and before the German &quot;Pillau&quot; class, German light cruisers (such as the and s) were faster but maintained a lighter 104 mm main armament compared to their British Town-class counterparts. With the &quot;Pillau&quot; and cruisers the Germans followed the British example of heavier guns.

Earlier German light cruisers were in competition with a series of British scout cruisers which had a higher speed of 25 knots, but smaller 3-inch 12 pounder guns or 4-inch guns. The Germans completed the last two of their cruisers in 1906 and 1907 and followed them up with four and two s between 1905 and 1908. These last two classes, larger and faster than the &quot;Bremen&quot;s, were armed the same (ten 4.1-inch guns) and carried less deck armor. Other major powers concentrated on battleship construction and built few cruisers. The United States, Italy, and Austria-Hungary each built only a handful of scout cruisers while Japan and Spain added a few examples based on British designs; France built none at all.

During World War I, the Germans continued building larger cruisers with 150 mm guns while the British &quot;Arethusa&quot; class and early s reverted to an emphasis on superior speed with a more lightly-armed design for fleet support.

===Between the wars===
The United States resumed building light cruisers in 1918, largely because the ships it then had in service had become obsolete. The first of these, the ten ships, displaced 7,050 tons and were armed with twelve guns. Eight of these guns were mounted in double-story casemates at the bow and stern, a reflection of the US prewar preference for heavy end-on fire. Fast and maneuverable, they were well-liked as seaboats despite being very wet in rough weather.

The term light cruiser was given a new definition by the London Naval Treaty of 1930. Light cruisers were defined as cruisers having guns of 6.1-inch (155 mm) or smaller, with heavy cruisers defined as cruisers having guns of up to 8-inch (203 mm). In both cases, the ships could not be greater than 10,000 tons.

After 1930, most naval powers concentrated on building light cruisers since they had already built up to the maximum limitations for heavy cruisers allowed under the Washington treaty. Japan laid down its four s between 1931 and 1934. The political climate from 1936 to 1939 gave the renewed building of light cruisers an added urgency. The British built 11 during this period, which culminated in the two ships, armed with 12 guns. The new ships were larger and better armored than other British treaty cruisers, with a belt in the Towns and were capable of 32.5 knots, but for the most part tried to stay within past treaty limitations. The US also attempted to follow treaty limitations as it completed seven of its nine s between 1938 and September 1939. These ships were an answer to Japan&#x27;s &quot;Mogami&quot;s and were an indication of rising tensions in the Pacific theater. Japan, now considering itself under no restrictions, began rearming its &quot;Mogami&quot;s with 10 guns. They were thus converted into heavy cruisers.

===World War II===

In World War II light cruisers had guns ranging from the 5 inch (127 mm) of the US and 5.25 inch of the British anti-aircraft cruisers, up to 6.1 inch, though the most common size was 6 inch, the maximum size allowed by the London Naval Treaty for a ship to be considered a light cruiser. Most Japanese light cruisers had 5.5-inch guns and could hardly be considered to be in the same class as a U.S. Navy light cruiser twice the size and carrying more than two times as much firepower. The &quot;Atlanta&quot;s and &quot;Dido&quot;s were born out of the tactical need for vessels to protect aircraft carriers, battleships and convoys from air attack.

The United States would move into full wartime production of the light cruisers of the &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class of which 27 would be produced. Not willing to allow changes to slow production, the United States allowed ships of the class to be built seriously overweight. They provided AA screening for the fast carriers, shore bombardment, and anti-destroyer screening for the US fleet. They traded a main gun turret for additional AA, fire control, and radar installations, over the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; class.

==Light cruisers today==
Four are preserved as museum ships: HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; in London, in Belfast, in Buffalo, New York, and &quot;Mikhail Kutuzov&quot; at Novorossiysk. Similar ships include the protected cruisers (St. Petersburg) and (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and the bow of &quot;Puglia&quot; (Gardone Riviera).

==United States Navy classification==

In the United States Navy, light cruisers have the hull classification symbol CL. Both heavy cruisers and light cruisers were classified under a common CL/CA sequence after 1931. 

After World War II, US Navy created several light cruiser sub-variants: the Hunter-Killer cruiser (CLK), the Antiaircraft cruiser (CLAA), the light Command cruiser (CLC), and the light Guided missile cruiser (CLG). All such ships have been retired.

<doc id="188557" wikidata="Q1423543" url="?curid=188557" title="Animal fat">
<text>Animal fats are lipids derived from animals which are used by the animal for a multitude of functions, or can be used by humans for dietary, sanitary, and cosmetic purposes. Depending on the temperature of the fat, it can change between a solid state and a liquid (oil) state. Chemically, both fats and oils are composed of triglycerides. Although many animal parts and secretions may yield oil, in commercial practice, oil is extracted primarily from rendered tissue fats from livestock animals like pigs, chickens and cows. Dairy products yield animal fat and oil products such as butter.

== Chemical structure ==
Animal fats are composed of triglycerides, which are a type of ester molecule in which glycerol is bonded to three fatty acids. The three fatty acids that bond to the glycerol will determine the complexity and type of the triglyceride. If the three fatty acids are the same, then the triglyceride will be considered a simple triglyceride. However, most triglycerides contain differing fatty acids, causing them to have differing characteristics. Animal fat is a combination of many different triglycerides. Fatty acids can be broken down into two categories, saturated and unsaturated fats. Most animal fats are saturated fats.

== Uses ==
=== For the Animal ===
Fat serves many purposes within an animal&#x27;s body. Some of these include insulating the body to regulate internal body temperature, serving as an energy reserve, and cushioning the feet. Many mammalian animals that live in cold regions of the globe, including both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, have developed a thick layer of fat just below the skin called blubber. This blubber helps these animals to reduce the amount of heat that is lost to the colder outside environment. Fat is a poor conductor of heat; therefore, it allows the heat that the animal produces to remain in their body for a longer period of time. Fat is also used by animals for the storage of energy. The type of fat that is used for energy storage is known as adipose tissue. This adipose tissue is made up adipocytes which store the energy in the chemical bonds of triglycerides. For example, prior to an animal going through hibernation, an animal will build up large reserves of adipocytes to ensure it has the energy to survive the long slumber. Fat is also used by animals to create foot pads. These foot pads aid in the longevity and health of the animal by absorbing the impacts that occur when the animal walks, runs, or jumps. These foot pads are present in many animals including cats, dogs, horses, and even larger mammals like elephants.

=== Human Culinary Uses ===
Many animal fats and oils are consumed directly, or indirectly as ingredients in food. Animal fats are commonly consumed as part of a western diet in their semi-solid form as either milk, butter, lard, schmaltz, and dripping or more commonly as filler in factory-produced meat, and fast-food products. Certain fats, such as goose fat, have a higher smoke point than other animal fats, but are still lower than many vegetable oils such as olive or avocado.

The oils serve a number of purposes in this role:
* Shortening – to give pastry a crumbly texture.
* Texture – oils can serve to make other ingredients stick together less.
* Flavor – some may be chosen specifically for the flavor they impart.
* Flavor base – oils can also &quot;carry&quot; flavors of other ingredients, since many flavors are present in chemicals that are soluble in oil.

Secondly, oils can be heated and used to cook foods. Suitability for this purpose depends on flash point.

=== Other Human Uses ===
There are many other human uses for animal fat, a few of these uses come from tallow. One of the uses of tallow is the production of soap through a process called saponification. The tallow is boiled or heated along with lye, resulting in the production of a rough soap as well as glycerol. The soap is then put through a purification process until it becomes a usable sanitary product. Tallow is also used in the production of many skincare and cosmetic products. Tallow contains vitamins E, D, K, and A as well as conjugated linoleic acid which have all been shown to have benefits to skin health.

<doc id="188560" wikidata="Q335823" url="?curid=188560" title="Slow Food">
<text>Slow Food is an organization that promotes local food and traditional cooking. It was founded by Carlo Petrini in Italy in 1986 and has since spread worldwide. Promoted as an alternative to fast food, it strives to preserve traditional and regional cuisine and encourages farming of plants, seeds, and livestock characteristic of the local ecosystem. It promotes local small businesses and sustainable foods. It also focuses on food quality, rather than quantity. It was the first established part of the broader slow movement. It speaks out against overproduction and food waste. It sees globalization as a process in which small and local farmers and food producers should be simultaneously protected from and included in the global food system.

==Organization==
Slow Food began in Italy with the founding of its forerunner organization, Arcigola, in 1986 to resist the opening of a McDonald&#x27;s near the Spanish Steps in Rome. In 1989, the founding manifesto of the international Slow Food movement was signed in Paris, France, by delegates from 15 countries.

At its heart is the aim to promote local foods and traditional gastronomy and food production. Conversely, this means an opposition to fast food and industrial food production.

The Slow Food organisation has expanded to include over 100,000 members, with branches in over 150 countries. Over 1,300 local &quot;convivia&quot; chapters exist. About 360 convivia in Italy—to which the name &quot;condotta&quot; (singular) / &quot;condotte&quot; (plural) applies—are composed of 35,000 members, along with 450 other regional chapters around the world. The organisational structure is decentralised: each convivium has a leader who is responsible for promoting local artisans, local farmers, and local flavors through regional events such as &quot;Taste Workshops&quot;, wine tastings, and farmers&#x27; markets.

Offices have been opened in Switzerland (1995), Germany (1998), New York City (2000), France (2003), Japan (2005), the United Kingdom, and Chile. Global headquarters are located in Bra, near Turin, Italy. Numerous publications are put out by the organisation, in several languages around the world. Recent efforts at publicity include the world&#x27;s largest food and wine fair, the Salone del Gusto in Turin, a biennial cheese fair in Bra called Cheese, the Genoan fish festival called SlowFish, and Turin&#x27;s Terra Madre (&quot;Mother Earth&quot;) world meeting of food communities.

In 2004, Slow Food opened a University of Gastronomic Sciences at Pollenzo, in Piedmont, and Colorno, in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. The Colorno branch has since been closed and transferred to Pollenzo. Carlo Petrini and Massimo Montanari are the leading figures in the creation of the university, whose goal is to promote awareness of good food and nutrition.

===Objectives===

Slow Food incorporates a series of objectives within its mission, including:

* developing an &quot;Ark of Taste&quot; for each ecoregion, where local culinary traditions and foods are celebrated
* creating &quot;Praesidia&quot; grassroots organizations to promote slow foods to the public
* forming and sustaining seed banks to preserve heirloom varieties in cooperation with local food systems
* preserving and promoting local and traditional food products, along with their lore and preparation
* organizing small-scale processing (including facilities for slaughtering and short run products)
* organizing celebrations of local cuisine within regions (for example, the Feast of Fields held in some cities in Canada)
* promoting &quot;taste education&quot;
* educating consumers about the risks of fast food
* educating citizens about the drawbacks of commercial agribusiness and factory farms
* educating citizens about the risks of monoculture and reliance on too few genomes or varieties
* developing various political programmes to preserve family farms
* lobbying for the inclusion of organic farming concerns within agricultural policy
* lobbying against government funding of genetic engineering
* lobbying against the use of pesticides
* teaching gardening skills to students and prisoners
* encouraging ethical buying in local marketplaces

Founder and president Carlo Petrini believes that &quot;everyone has the right to good, clean, and fair food&quot;: &quot;good&quot;, meaning a high quality product with a flavorful taste; &quot;clean&quot;, meaning the naturalness in the way the product was produced and transported; &quot;fair&quot;, meaning adequate pricing and treatment for both the consumers and producers.

==Events==
===Slow Food Nation===
Slow Food Nation was an event organized by Slow Food USA, which celebrates slow and sustainable foods. Slow Food Nation attracted an estimated audience of more than 50,000 people. Held over the Labor Day weekend from August 29 to September 1, 2008, the majority of the event took place in either San Francisco&#x27;s Civic Center and Fort Mason Center. Slow Food Nation&#x27;s founder is influential chef and author Alice Waters. In addition to a specially-created &quot;victory garden&quot; in front of San Francisco City Hall, a marketplace, tastings, and other events, Slow Food Nation featured panels led by food scholars such as Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser, as well as the founder of Slow Food, Carlo Petrini.

==National movements==

===United States===
In 2008, Slow Food USA hosted its largest gathering to date dubbed Slow Food Nation in San Francisco. The event reconvened in 2017 as Slow Food Nations, the stateside equivalent to Terra Madre Salone del Gusto, and was held in Denver, Colorado. The event is scheduled to continue in 2018.

, Slow Food USA has a membership of roughly 12,000, down from over 30,000 in 2008. In 2011, the organization was forced to make a series of staff layoffs and reductions and had faced a significant reduction in their income from wealthy supporters. This was partly attributed to the economic recession, but also to disagreements within the movement and a loss of several key personalities.

As of 2024, Slow Food USA has 200 chapters, down from 225 chapters in 2011. These are locally based and governed 501(c)3 non-profit organizations that hold events and education outreach programs that benefit their communities while carrying out the message of the slow food movement and advancing the local environmental movement. The movement also encourages the creation of urban gardens.

Beyond the chapters established within the cities in the United States, a number of universities are becoming recognised by Slow Food USA, including the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Slow Food-University of Wisconsin has five projects that are dedicated to the movement&#x27;s efforts, including a Family Dinner Night, weekly café, and a Farm to University scheme. From then, 46 Slow Food chapters have been established on campuses of higher education.

Notable members include Alice Waters, Eric Schlosser, Pamela Sheldon Johns, Fabrizio Facchini and Michael Pollan. As of 2021, the executive director is Anna Mulé.

In October 2014, the organization formed an initial 15-month partnership with fast-food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill, which had the company funding $500,000 toward Slow Food USA&#x27;s National School Garden Program; 100 school gardens in different cities across the US would be funded in an effort to teach children where food comes from and how food is grown.

===United Kingdom===
Slow Food UK works to raise strategic awareness about sustainability and social justice issues surrounding food and farming in Britain. In 2014, Slow Food UK devolved into Slow Food England, Slow Food Scotland, Slow Food Cymru, and Slow Food Northern Ireland. Slow Food UK as an entity provides administrative support to those nations and local groups, and the Slow Food UK Board is now made up of directors from the nations (Shane Holland, Chair &amp; Director for England; John Cooke, Director for Scotland; Illtud Dunsford, Director for Wales; and Paula McIntyre, Director for Slow Food Northern Ireland). The numerous local groups are led by Slow Food members, who take significant grassroots action in their local communities. The many notable Slow Food UK members and supporters include Raymond Blanc and Jamie Oliver.

Some of the local groups are very large, such as Slow Food London, and run programmes such as the Slow Food Global Schools Twinning Programme, which are more akin to the work of a national office. Slow Food London is also the major campaigning Slow Food body within the UK, responding to every local, national, and European consultation on food, fisheries, and agriculture, and has even been a co-signatory in judicial review against the UK government in regards to food and farming, retaining a leading firm of solicitors &quot;pro bono&quot; on an ongoing basis.

Besides running national education programmes, such as Slow Food Kids, and Slow Food on Campus, Slow Food UK National Office co-ordinates fights to preserve British culinary heritage through the Chef Alliance and Forgotten Foods programmes (UK Ark of Taste). The Chef Alliance is a network of chefs committed to protecting Britain&#x27;s edible biodiversity by cooking with Forgotten Foods, or foods that are produced on a very small scale and are being lost due to commercial varieties overtaking the market. The Forgotten Foods programme is part of the Slow Food International Ark of Taste. In 2014, the Chef Alliance had over 100 members, and now over 150 Forgotten Foods are recognized.

===Australia===
The Australian slow food movement aims to increase community awareness of the value from farm to market of good, clean, local food. A campaign is being mounted to have included in Slow Food International&#x27;s Ark of Taste (nationally nominated threatened produce and food products) the following Australian foods: Kangaroo Island&#x27;s Ligurian bee honey, the Queensland-native bunya nut, bull-boar sausage from Victoria, and Tasmanian leatherwood honey.

===The Netherlands===
In the Netherlands especially the Slow Food Youth Network (SFYN) is very active. SFYN is a worldwide network of young people creating a better future through food. SFYN believes that they, as young people, must play an important role in the future of food production and consumption. That is why they bring young consumers, producers, farmers, chefs and students closer together. In the Netherlands they do this through eat-ins, tastings, events such as World Disco Soup Day, the talkshow Als Warme Broodjes, campaigns such as food education and projects such as the SFYN Academy.

===Latvia===
In 2005, British-born Latvian chef Mārtiņš Rītiņš became the president of the newly-founded Latvian Slow Food Association, which has been organizing slow food festivals in cities across Latvia with cooking demonstrations by Rītiņš and other chefs, tastings by local organic producers and cultural handicrafts (such as fine silver jewellery, beeswax candles, leather books, pottery and hemp clothing) by local artisans.

==Wine==
In 2010, Slow Food International began its independent Slow Wine project with the release of a wine guide. Prior to 2010, Slow Food Worked with publisher Gambero Rosso to release a guide. The first edition of Slow Food&#x27;s first solo effort was released in 1993, with the title &quot;Slow Food guide to the wines of the world&quot;, translated into five languages and sold in more than 50,000 copies. The guide was an attempt to review not only the wines, but also the wineries and the people behind the bottle. Two editions of the guide have been published, also available in English.

== Eco-gastronomy ==
Eco-gastronomy encompasses the Slow Food movement within a broader context. Eco-gastronomy is concerned with environmental sensitivity, biodiversity, and sustainable agriculture. In relation to the Slow Food movement, gastronomic knowledge is closely related to distinct biodiversity within different cultures around the world. Utilizing this knowledge allows for it to be used and defended.

In 2000, the Slow Food Presidia project was launched. The goal of the project was to protect and relaunch local and traditional agriculture at risk of extinction. Today, Slow Food Presidia includes communities that are committed to passing on traditional production techniques and crafts as well as preserving native food and livestock breeds. Each Presidium represents a community of producers inspired by the slow food philosophy, a traditional food product, a place, and cultural heritage and a legacy of knowledge. The Presidia Project represents a shift from cataloging information to implementing the knowledge through the direct involvement of food producers.

==Criticisms==
Slow Food&#x27;s aims have been compared to the Arts and Crafts movement&#x27;s response to 19th-century industrialisation. Some of the criticisms aimed at the movement are socioeconomic. For example, without significantly altering the working day of the masses, slow food preparation can be an additional burden to whoever prepares food. In contrast, the more affluent society can afford the time and expense of developing &quot;taste&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;, and &quot;discernment&quot;. Slow Food&#x27;s stated aim of preserving itself from the &quot;contagion of the multitude&quot; can be seen as elitist by those that consume fast food or are not part of the movement. In 1989, Petrini visited Venezuela and began to recognize the socioeconomic barriers that many faced with regard to the slow food movement. To address this, he adjusted the slow food agenda to include an alternative food approach that favored healthy, local, community-based food consumption and production. While this made the slow food movement more accessible for many, it did not eliminate all of the socioeconomic barriers faced within the movement.

<doc id="188562" wikidata="Q25324082" url="?curid=188562" title="Eco-gastronomy">
<text>Eco-gastronomy is an approach to alternative consumption that stresses the importance of the interaction between humans and food and the effect produced by that. It aims to get a healthier and more sustainable food and, at the same time, to reduce the impact on the environment, from the productive and the consumptive side.

== Term ==

The Latin term &quot;eco&quot; refers to how organisms relate to their environment, while &quot;gastronomy&quot;, according to food philosopher Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, is the intelligent knowledge of whatever concerns man&#x27;s nourishment.

The fusion of these two words creates the concept of eco-gastronomy. The prefix eco is used to highlight the connections between &quot;the art and appreciation of food&quot; and every issue related to the process of food production and consumption, from the environmental care to the social and ethical concerns.

Ecogastronomy &quot;links food and humans, while bringing attention to the responsibility that all people have for the health and well-being of our food ways&quot;.

== Context ==

The concept of eco-gastronomy belongs to the field of food consumption that is rather criticized and contested as it involves a series of ethical issues, such as immediate versus delayed gratification, nature versus culture, necessity versus luxury, body versus mind, etc.

In this context there are a series of forms of critical and alternative consumption, associated by their critiques (generally deriving from the homogenization of capitalist mode of production) and their proposals of alternative lifestyles. 
A cohesive movement of alternative consumption does not exist, since every form of alternative consumption differs in its target and scope. What these phenomena have in common is the belief that consumers can, and should, use their power of choice to modify market relations, in order to make them fairer and more conducive to a good life for all.

More than a simple form of alternative consumption, eco-gastronomy is an approach that can be adopted in this context. 
The same attention is given both to the individual and to the community/nature side.
Regarding the scope, the eco-gastronomic approach tries to find alternative forms of integration in the capitalist culture, based on the attention given to the quality of food and on the relations between humans and their impact on the environment.

== Connections with the Slow Food movement ==
The concept indeed is strictly related to that one of Slow Food. In fact, the term eco-gastronomy was coined by the non-profit organization&#x27;s founder, Carlo Petrini. While the latter can be defined as a movement, eco-gastronomy has broader and wider connotations: rather than a simple movement, it is an approach that can be adopted in order to fulfill some form of alternative consumption.
The Slow Food movement is an example of a form of critical consumption that has adopted, throughout the years, an eco-gastronomic approach.

Indeed, while in the early stages, the concept of sustainability, that is crucial to eco-gastronomy, was not greatly contemplated by the Slow Food movement, in the last years SF seems to have shifted focus from the safeguard of typical foods to the safeguard of their cultural and environmental premises. The emphasis has been especially put on biodiversity, sustainable agriculture and responsible consumption.

In 2005, Carlo Petrini provided a theoretical perspective of eco-gastronomy stating that &quot;agriculture and ecology are part of gastronomy because they help us understand where our food comes from and produce it in the best possible way – by simultaneously observing the principles of taste, respect for the environment and biodiversity&quot;.

Nowadays, Slow Food is no more only about paying attention to the quality of food and the pleasure of eating. 
Food thus must be produced according to ecological methods, free from pesticides and artificial fertilizer. Clean is an essential quality in the food people eat, but the concept is also concerned in the landscape where the food is produced.

As Petrini continues:

&quot;If you love food but aren&#x27;t environmentally aware you&#x27;re at best naïve, and at worst, stupid. But an ecologist who is not a gourmet is ... well, he&#x27;s just boring&quot; &lt;br&gt;

== Projects and applications ==
In a context made of a growing spread of movements, ideologies and approaches which promote critical consumption, the concept of eco-gastronomy has prepared the ground to a variety of projects. Starting from single actions and choices of everyone&#x27;s daily life, these projects aim to create an always larger network of people who share a sustainable life style.

As shown below, the key players are not only consumers and producers, but also, at a lower level, students, families and researchers.

=== Dual Major in Eco-gastronomy by the University of New Hampshire ===

In 2006, the University of New Hampshire signed the Slow Food Agreements of Intentions and Collaborations in order to create a worldwide network of universities and research institutions to promote protection and agricultural biodiversity, support of the rights of people to self-determination with regard to food and educate civilized society and train workers in the food and agricultural sector.

In 2008 the University of New Hampshire, in collaboration with other institutions, approved with the Board of Trustees the dual major in Eco-Gastronomy.

The mission of this unique dual major is to provide students with the necessary skills and knowledge in order to work in an evolving food community integrating sustainable agriculture, food and nutrition following the principles of the eco-gastronomic approach.

=== The Eco-gastronomy project by the University of Gastronomic Sciences ===
The University of Gastronomic Sciences UNISG was founded in Italy in 2004 by Slow Food International.

The Eco-Gastronomy project was launched in November 2015 by this university. It is a multi-year initiative to create an international exchange of knowledge about food and food systems.

The mission of the project is to build an international network of food visionaries, building innovation, flexibility, and justice into global food systems. Indeed, this project is developed in fourteen different countries around the world where local partners collaborate on the development of an ecological-philosophical approach of food.

<doc id="188564" wikidata="Q310953" url="?curid=188564" title="Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)">
<text>William James O&#x27;Reilly Jr. (born September 10, 1949) is an American conservative commentator, journalist, author, and television host.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s broadcasting career began during the late 1970s and 1980s, when he reported for local television stations in the United States and later for CBS News and ABC News, the former of which earned O&#x27;Reilly two Emmy Awards and two National Headliner Awards for excellence in reporting. He anchored the tabloid television program &quot;Inside Edition&quot; from 1989 to 1995. O&#x27;Reilly joined the Fox News Channel in 1996 and hosted the news commentary program &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; until 2017. &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; had been the highest-rated cable news show for 16 years, and he was described by media analyst Howard Kurtz as &quot;the biggest star in the 20-year history at Fox News&quot; at the time of his departure.

During his time at Fox News, he appeared several times as a guest on the Comedy Central talk show &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;. Together he and Jon Stewart debated for a charity event, &quot;The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium&quot; at George Washington University in 2012. O&#x27;Reilly interviewed President Barack Obama before Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014. He co-authored with Martin Dugard numerous &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestselling historical novels including &quot;Killing Lincoln&quot; (2011), &quot;Killing Kennedy&quot; (2012), &quot;Killing Jesus&quot; (2013), and &quot;Killing Reagan&quot; (2015), which were adapted into National Geographic television films in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2016. Two of the films earned O&#x27;Reilly nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards. He also hosted &quot;The Radio Factor&quot; from 2002 to 2009.

In 2017, O&#x27;Reilly was dismissed from Fox News following a report by &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he had settled five lawsuits involving sexual misconduct. Since then, O&#x27;Reilly has hosted the &quot;No Spin News&quot; podcast where it has also expanded into a television program, first airing on Newsmax, then on The First.

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Reilly was born on September 10, 1949, at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan to parents William James Sr. and Winifred Angela (née Drake) O&#x27;Reilly from Brooklyn and Teaneck, New Jersey, respectively. He is of Irish descent with a small degree of English (Colonial American) ancestry. Some of his father&#x27;s ancestors lived in County Cavan, Ireland, since the early eighteenth century, and on his mother&#x27;s side he has ancestry from Northern Ireland. The O&#x27;Reilly family lived in a small apartment in Fort Lee, New Jersey, when their son was born. In 1951, his family moved to Levittown on Long Island. O&#x27;Reilly has a sister, Janet.

O&#x27;Reilly attended St. Brigid parochial school in Westbury and Chaminade High School, a private Catholic boys high school, in Mineola. His father wanted him to attend Chaminade, but O&#x27;Reilly wanted to attend W. Tresper Clarke High School, the public school most of his closest friends would attend. He played Little League baseball and was the goalie on the Chaminade varsity hockey team. During his high school years, he met future singer Billy Joel, whom O&#x27;Reilly described as a &quot;hoodlum&quot;. O&#x27;Reilly recollected in an interview with Michael Kay on the YES Network show &quot;CenterStage&quot; that Joel &quot;was in the Hicksville section—the same age as me—and he was a hood. He used to slick it [his hair] back like this. And we knew him, because his guys would smoke and this and that, and we were more jocks.&quot;

After graduating from Chaminade in 1967, O&#x27;Reilly attended Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York. While at Marist, he was a punter in the National Club Football Association and also wrote for the school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Circle&quot;. He was an honors student who majored in history. He spent his junior year of college abroad, attending Queen Mary College at the University of London. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1971. He played semi-professional baseball during this time as a pitcher for the New York Monarchs. After graduating from Marist College, O&#x27;Reilly moved to Miami where he taught English and history at Monsignor Pace High School from 1970 to 1972. He returned to school in 1973 and earned a Master of Arts degree in broadcast journalism from Boston University. While attending Boston University, he was a reporter and columnist for various local newspapers and alternative news weeklies, including the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot;, and did an internship in the newsroom of WBZ-TV. In 1995, he attended the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and received a master of public administration degree in 1996.

Marist College had bestowed an honorary degree upon O&#x27;Reilly, which would later be revoked once the sexual abuse allegations came to light.

==Broadcasting career==
===1973–1980: Early career===
O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s early television news career included reporting and anchoring positions at WNEP-TV in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he also reported the weather. At WFAA-TV in Dallas, O&#x27;Reilly was awarded the Dallas Press Club Award for excellence in investigative reporting. He then moved to KMGH-TV in Denver, where he won a local Emmy Award for his coverage of a skyjacking. O&#x27;Reilly also worked for WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut from 1979 to 1980. In 1980, O&#x27;Reilly anchored the local news-feature program &quot;7:30 Magazine&quot; at WCBS-TV in New York. Soon after, as a WCBS News anchor and correspondent, he won his second local Emmy, which was for an investigation of corrupt city marshals.

=== 1982–1986: &quot;CBS News&quot; and return to local television ===
In 1982, he became a CBS News correspondent, covering the wars in El Salvador on location and in the Falkland Islands from his base in Buenos Aires, Argentina. O&#x27;Reilly left CBS over a dispute concerning the uncredited use in a report by Bob Schieffer of footage of a riot in response to the military junta&#x27;s surrender shot by O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s crew in Buenos Aires shortly after the conclusion of the war.

After departing CBS News in 1982, O&#x27;Reilly joined WNEV-TV (now WHDH) in Boston, as a weekday reporter, weekend anchor and later as host of the station&#x27;s local news magazine &quot;New England Afternoon&quot;. In 1984, O&#x27;Reilly went to KATU in Portland, Oregon, where he remained for nine months, then he returned to Boston and joined WCVB-TV as reporter and columnist-at-large for &quot;NewsCenter 5&quot;.

=== 1986–1989: &quot;ABC News&quot; ===
In 1986, O&#x27;Reilly moved to ABC News, where, during his three-year tenure, he received two Emmy Awards and two National Headliner Awards for excellence in reporting. He had delivered a eulogy for his friend Joe Spencer, an ABC News correspondent who died in a helicopter crash on January 22, 1986, en route to covering the 1985–86 Hormel strike. ABC News president Roone Arledge, who attended Spencer&#x27;s funeral, decided to hire O&#x27;Reilly after hearing the eulogy. At ABC, O&#x27;Reilly hosted daytime news briefs that previewed stories to be reported on the day&#x27;s &quot;World News Tonight&quot; and worked as a general assignment reporter for ABC News programs, including &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, and &quot;World News Tonight&quot;.

===1989–1995: &quot;Inside Edition&quot;===

In 1989, O&#x27;Reilly joined the nationally syndicated King World (now CBS Television Distribution)-produced &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, a tabloid-gossip television program in competition with &quot;A Current Affair&quot;. He became the program&#x27;s anchor three weeks into its run after the involvement of original anchor David Frost had ended.

In 1995, former NBC News and CBS News anchor Deborah Norville replaced O&#x27;Reilly on &quot;Inside Edition&quot;; O&#x27;Reilly had expressed a desire to quit the show in July 1994.

====Viral video====
On May 12, 2008, an outtake of O&#x27;Reilly ranting during his time at &quot;Inside Edition&quot; surfaced on YouTube. The early 1990s video depicts O&#x27;Reilly yelling and cursing at his co-workers while having issues pre-recording the closing lines on his teleprompter, eventually yelling the phrase &quot;Fuck it, we&#x27;ll do it live!&quot; before continuing the closing segment to his show. The original video, titled &quot;Bill O&#x27;Reilly Flips Out,&quot; was removed, but another user uploaded it once again the day after and retitled it &quot;Bill O&#x27;Reilly Goes Nuts&quot;. Immediately after the video surfaced, O&#x27;Reilly acknowledged the video&#x27;s existence, claiming that he was amusing his co-workers and said &quot;I have plenty of much newer stuff... If you want to buy the tapes that I have, I&#x27;m happy to sell them to you.&quot; The rant was later parodied by Stephen Colbert on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; as well as &quot;Family Guy&quot; and by Trevor Noah on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, and was named one of &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;Top 10 Celebrity Meltdowns&quot;. In October 2008, Wednesday 13 named his first live album after a line in the rant. In 2009, a &quot;dance remix&quot; of O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s rant was nominated for a Webby Award for &quot;Best Viral Video&quot; but lost to &quot;The Website Is Down: Sales Guy vs. Web Dude&quot;.

===1996–2017: &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;===
In October 1996, O&#x27;Reilly was hired by Roger Ailes, chairman and CEO of the then startup Fox News Channel, to anchor &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Report&quot;. The show was renamed &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; after his friend and branding expert John Tantillo&#x27;s remarks upon the &quot;O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; in any of the stories he told. The program was routinely the highest-rated show of the three major U.S. 24-hour cable news television channels and began the trend toward more opinion-oriented prime-time cable news programming. The show was taped late in the afternoon at a studio in New York City and aired every weekday on the Fox News Channel at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and was rebroadcast at 11:00 p.m.

Progressive media monitoring organizations such as Media Matters and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting have criticized his reporting on a variety of issues, accusing him of distorting facts and using misleading or erroneous statistics. In 2008, citing numerous inaccuracies in his reporting, MediaMatters for America awarded him its first annual &quot;Misinformer of the Year&quot; award.
After the September 11 attacks, O&#x27;Reilly accused the United Way of America and American Red Cross of failing to deliver millions of dollars in donated money, raised by the organizations in the name of the disaster, to the families of those killed in the attacks. He reported that the organizations misrepresented their intentions for the money being raised by not distributing all of the 9/11 relief fund to the victims. Actor George Clooney responded, accusing him of misstating facts and harming the relief effort by inciting &quot;panic&quot; among potential donors. On August 27, 2002, O&#x27;Reilly called for all Americans to boycott Pepsi products, saying that lyrics of Ludacris (then appearing in ads for Pepsi) glamorize a &quot;life of guns, violence, drugs and disrespect of women&quot;. The next day, O&#x27;Reilly reported that Pepsi had fired Ludacris. Two years later, Ludacris referenced O&#x27;Reilly in the song &quot;Number One Spot&quot; with the lyrics &quot;Respected highly, hi, Mr. O&#x27;Reilly/Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey,&quot; in reference to his sexual-harassment suit with Andrea Mackris while married. In an interview with RadarOnline.com in 2010, Ludacris said he and O&#x27;Reilly had made amends after a conversation at a charity event.

Speaking on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on March 18, 2003, he promised that &quot;[i]f the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it&#x27;s clean [of weapons of mass destruction] ... I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush administration again.&quot; In another appearance on the same program on February 10, 2004, he responded to repeated requests for him to honor his pledge: &quot;My analysis was wrong and I&#x27;m sorry. I was wrong. I&#x27;m not pleased about it at all.&quot; With regard to his trust in the government, he said, &quot;I am much more skeptical of the Bush administration now than I was at that time.&quot;

Beginning in 2005, he periodically denounced George Tiller, a Kansas-based physician who specialized in second- and third-trimester abortions, often referring to him as &quot;Tiller the baby killer&quot;. Tiller was murdered on May 31, 2009, by Scott Roeder, an anti-abortion activist. Critics such as &quot;Salon&quot;″s Gabriel Winant have asserted that his anti-Tiller rhetoric helped to create an atmosphere of violence around the doctor. Jay Bookman of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; wrote that O&#x27;Reilly &quot;clearly went overboard in his condemnation and demonization of Tiller&quot; but added that it was &quot;irresponsible to link O&#x27;Reilly&quot; to Tiller&#x27;s murder. O&#x27;Reilly responded to the criticism by saying &quot;no backpedaling here ... every single thing we said about Tiller was true.&quot;
In early 2007, researchers from the Indiana University School of Journalism published a report that analyzed his &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; segment. Using analysis techniques developed in the 1930s by the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, the study concluded that he used propaganda, frequently engaged in name calling, and consistently cast non-Americans as threats and never &quot;in the role of victim or hero&quot;. He responded, asserting that &quot;the terms &#x27;conservative&#x27;, &#x27;liberal&#x27;, &#x27;left&#x27;, &#x27;right&#x27;, &#x27;progressive&#x27;, &#x27;traditional&#x27; and &#x27;centrist&#x27; were considered name-calling if they were associated with a problem or social ill.&quot; The study&#x27;s authors said that those terms were only considered name-calling when linked to derogatory qualifiers. Fox News producer Ron Mitchell wrote an op-ed in which he accused the study&#x27;s authors of seeking to manipulate their research to fit a predetermined outcome. Mitchell argued that by using tools developed for examining propaganda, the researchers presupposed that he propagandized.

On April 19, 2017, Fox News announced that O&#x27;Reilly would not return to their primetime lineup amid public reporting on the tens of millions of dollars he paid to settle the sexual harassment claims of six women. The show continued, rebranded as &quot;The Factor&quot;, now hosted by Dana Perino. On the same day, Fox announced that Tucker Carlson&#x27;s show would be airing an hour earlier to take over O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s position and that &quot;The Five&quot; will replace Carlson&#x27;s usual time at 9 p.m. with a new co-host, Jesse Watters. After O&#x27;Reilly was fired, the financial markets responded positively to the decision by Fox News, and its parent company 21st Century Fox rose over two percent in the stock market the next day.

==== Departure from Fox News ====
In April 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Fox News and O&#x27;Reilly had settled five lawsuits involving women who accused O&#x27;Reilly of misconduct. After the settlements were reported, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; lost more than half its advertisers within a week; almost 60 companies withdrew their television advertising from the show amid a growing backlash against O&#x27;Reilly. On April 11, O&#x27;Reilly announced he would take a two-week vacation and would return to the program on April 24; he normally took a vacation around Easter. On April 19, Fox News announced that O&#x27;Reilly would not be returning to the network. The program was subsequently renamed &quot;The Factor&quot; on April 19 and aired its last episode on April 21.

O&#x27;Reilly later stated his regret that he did not &quot;fight back&quot; against his accusers the way Sean Hannity did when facing the loss of advertisers around the same time.

===2017–present: Post-Fox News career===
O&#x27;Reilly launched a podcast called &quot;No Spin News&quot; on April 24, 2017, after his departure from Fox News. In August 2017, O&#x27;Reilly began digitally streaming a video version of &quot;No Spin News&quot;. In May 2017, O&#x27;Reilly began to appear as a recurring guest on Friday editions of the &quot;Glenn Beck Radio Program&quot;. In June 2017, O&#x27;Reilly and Dennis Miller co-headlined the public speaking tour, &quot;The Spin Stops Here&quot;.

O&#x27;Reilly made his first appearance on Fox News since his ouster on September 26, 2017, being interviewed by Sean Hannity. In 2019, O&#x27;Reilly started a 15-minute radio show, &quot;The O’Reilly Update&quot;. By 2020, simulcasts of O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;No Spin News&quot; show began to air on Newsmax TV. &quot;No Spin News&quot; began airing on The First TV in June 2020. O&#x27;Reilly participated in a speaking tour with former president Donald Trump in December 2021, which he said &quot;[provided] a never before heard inside view of his administration&quot;.

== Other ventures ==
===Newspaper column===
O&#x27;Reilly wrote a weekly syndicated newspaper column through Creators Syndicate that appeared in numerous newspapers, including the &quot;New York Post&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. He discontinued the column at the end of 2013.

===Radio work===

From 2002 to 2009, he hosted a radio program called &quot;The Radio Factor&quot; that had more than 3.26 million listeners and was carried by more than 400 radio stations. According to the talk radio industry publication &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot;, he was No. 11 on the &quot;Heavy Hundred,&quot; a list of the 100 most important talk show hosts in America.

In 2019, O&#x27;Reilly returned to radio with a daily 15-minute series &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Update&quot;. The program airs during or near lunch hour on most stations in a time slot previously used by Paul Harvey. In September 2020, O&#x27;Reilly began hosting a daily radio show on 77WABC titled &quot;Common Sense with Bill O’Reilly&quot;.

===&quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;===
From 2001 to 2015, O&#x27;Reilly appeared on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; fifteen times. Stewart also appeared as a guest various times on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. In 2011, Stewart described O&#x27;Reilly as &quot;the voice of reason on Fox News&quot;, comparing him to &quot;the thinnest kid at fat camp&quot;.

In 2012, Stewart joined O&#x27;Reilly in a debate for charity entitled, &quot;The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium&quot; at George Washington University. &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that O&#x27;Reilly and Stewart &quot;have been guests on each other’s programs since 2001&quot; but &quot;rarely agree on anything except their mutual respect for each other&quot;. In 2014, Stewart debated him on the belief of white privilege. During the debate O&#x27;Reilly exclaimed, &quot;You think I&#x27;m sitting here because I&#x27;m white? What are you, a moron? I&#x27;m sitting here because I&#x27;m obnoxious, not because I&#x27;m white!&quot;.

In 2015, O&#x27;Reilly briefly appeared on Stewart&#x27;s final show as host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. O&#x27;Reilly joked, &quot;Have fun feeding your rabbits, quitter!&quot; O&#x27;Reilly also wrote a lengthy appreciation for Stewart in &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; writing, &quot;[Stewart] will leave a void in the world of political satire. Undeniably, Jon Stewart was great at what he did. Whatever that was.&quot;

In 2024, when Stewart returned to &quot;The Daily Show&quot; for the 2024 United States presidential election, he invited O&#x27;Reilly to appear on the show following the assassination attempt on former President and candidate Donald Trump.

=== Film and television ===
O&#x27;Reilly made cameo appearances in the films &quot;An American Carol&quot; (2008), &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010), &quot;&quot; (2011) and &quot;Man Down&quot; (2015).

In 2010, he famously appeared on &quot;The View&quot;, where they asked O&#x27;Reilly his opinion on whether to remove the mosque near the 9/11 memorial site. O&#x27;Reilly responded saying, that he believed they should and during the heated discussion stated, &quot;Muslims killed us on 9/11&quot; to which Whoopi Goldberg, and Joy Behar walked off the set. Barbara Walters chided the other hosts, and stated, &quot;You have just seen what should not happen. We should be able to have discussions without washing our hands and screaming and walking off stage. I love my colleagues, but that should not have happened.&quot; He also made appearances on various talk and late night shows including, &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot;, and &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;.

In 2013, he appeared at the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony where he gave tribute to jazz musician Herbie Hancock. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s unexpected presence was not lost on the audience, as his appearance elicited audible gasps from the crowd to which O&#x27;Reilly responded, &quot;I know I&#x27;m surprised too.&quot; During his tribute to Hancock, O&#x27;Reilly stated, &quot;Herbie is a true gentleman. His fame and his skill reflect the values of that have made this country great...It&#x27;s that embracing of what is good in mankind that that infuses Hancock&#x27;s music and makes him a national icon&quot;.

O&#x27;Reilly was an executive producer on many television projects including on made for television films based upon his books. This includes films, &quot;Killing Lincoln&quot; (2013), &quot;Killing Kennedy&quot; (2013), &quot;Killing Jesus&quot; (2015), and &quot;Killing Reagan&quot; (2016) which aired on National Geographic. O&#x27;Reilly received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Television Movie for &quot;Killing Kennedy&quot; and &quot;Killing Jesus&quot;. From 2015 to 2018, O&#x27;Reilly also served as an executive producer on the documentary series, &quot;Legends &amp; Lies&quot;.

== Awards and nominations ==
Over his career O&#x27;Reilly has received numerous accoaldes for his work as a reporter and television journalist. In Dallas, O&#x27;Reilly won a Dallas Press Club Award and he received an Emmy Award for his coverage of a skyjacking while working in Denver. He also received two National Headliner Awards. In 1980, he became an anchor and correspondent for WCBS-TV in New York, where he earned a second Emmy Award. He earned a Master of the Arts degree in broadcast journalism in 1973 from Boston University and a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1995. For his work in entertainment television he was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards.

==Political views and media coverage==
On &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; and on his former talk-radio program, O&#x27;Reilly focused on news and commentary related to politics and culture. O&#x27;Reilly has long said that he does not identify with any political ideology, writing in his book &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; that the reader &quot;might be wondering whether I&#x27;m conservative, liberal, libertarian, or exactly what ... See, I don&#x27;t want to fit any of those labels, because I believe that the truth doesn&#x27;t have labels. When I see corruption, I try to expose it. When I see exploitation, I try to fight it. That&#x27;s my political position.&quot; On December 6, 2000, the &quot;Daily News&quot; in New York reported, however, that he had been registered with the Republican Party in the state of New York since 1994. When questioned about this, he said that he was not aware of it and says he registered as an independent after the interview. During a broadcast of &quot;The Radio Factor&quot;, O&#x27;Reilly said that there was no option to register as an independent voter; however, there was in fact a box marked &quot;I do not wish to enroll in party.&quot; Despite his remarks, many view him as a conservative figure. A February 2009 Pew Research poll found that 66% of his television viewers identify themselves as conservative, 24% moderate, and 3% liberal. A November 2008 poll by Zogby International found that O&#x27;Reilly was the second most trusted news personality, after Rush Limbaugh.

In a 2003 interview with Terry Gross on National Public Radio, O&#x27;Reilly said:
On a September 2007 edition of &quot;The Radio Factor&quot;, while having a discussion about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author Juan Williams about a meal he shared with Al Sharpton, O&#x27;Reilly said &quot;You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything. But everybody was very nice. And I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia&#x27;s Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it&#x27;s run by blacks, primarily black patronship.&quot; He commented that no one in Sylvia&#x27;s was &quot;screaming &#x27;M&#x27;Fer, I want more iced tea.&#x27;&quot; He further added, &quot;I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They&#x27;re just trying to figure it out. &#x27;Look, I can make it. If I work hard and get educated, I can make it.&#x27;&quot; The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that black people are just now starting to value education is &quot;ridiculous&quot; and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is &quot;nuts&quot;. Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions. O&#x27;Reilly responded, saying, &quot;It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we&#x27;re all Americans. The stereotypes they see on television are not true&quot; and also called out Media Matters, claiming that &quot;Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism.&quot; Juan Williams said the criticism of O&#x27;Reilly was &quot;rank dishonesty&quot; and that the original comments &quot;had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN.&quot; Williams went on to say it was &quot;frustrating&quot; that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race. In July 2016, Michelle Obama spoke of what it was like to live &quot;in a house that was built by slaves&quot; in reference to her time in the White House, with O&#x27;Reilly responding the slaves &quot;were well-fed and had decent lodgings&quot;. Following criticism he defended his comment by stating that the nation&#x27;s first president provided slaves with &quot;meat, bread and other staples&quot;.

O&#x27;Reilly has long said that his inspiration for speaking up for average Americans is his working-class roots. He has pointed to his boyhood home in Levittown, New York, as a credential. In an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s mother said that her family lived in Westbury, which is a few miles from Levittown. Citing this interview, then liberal talk-show pundit Al Franken accused O&#x27;Reilly of distorting his background to create a more working-class image. O&#x27;Reilly countered that &quot;The Washington Post&quot; misquoted his mother and that his mother still lives in his childhood home which was built by William Levitt. O&#x27;Reilly placed a copy of the house&#x27;s mortgage on his website; the mortgage shows a Levittown postal address. O&#x27;Reilly has also said, &quot;You don&#x27;t come from any lower than I came from on an economic scale&quot; and that his father, a currency accountant for an oil company, &quot;never earned more than $35,000 a year in his life&quot;. O&#x27;Reilly responded that his father&#x27;s $35,000 income only came at the end of his long career.

He was the main inspiration for comedian Stephen Colbert&#x27;s satirical character on the Comedy Central show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, which featured Colbert in a &quot;full-dress parody&quot; of &quot;The Factor&quot;. On the show, Colbert referred to him as &quot;Papa Bear&quot;. He and Colbert exchanged appearances on each other&#x27;s shows in January 2007.

On May 10, 2008, he was presented with the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Governors&#x27; Award at an Emmy awards show dinner.

== Disputed claims ==

=== George de Mohrenschildt claim ===
In his bestselling 2013 book &quot;Killing Kennedy&quot; and on &quot;Fox and Friends&quot;, O&#x27;Reilly claimed he was knocking at the front door of George de Mohrenschildt&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s home at the moment Mohrenschildt committed suicide and that he heard the shotgun blast:

In March of 1977, a young television reporter at WFAA in Dallas began looking into the Kennedy assassination. As part of his reporting, he sought an interview with the shadowy Russian professor who had befriended the Oswalds upon their arrival in Dallas in 1962. The reporter traced George de Mohrenschildt to Palm Beach, Florida and traveled there to confront him. At the time de Mohrenschildt had been called to testify before a congressional committee looking into the events of November 1963. As the reporter knocked on the door of de Mohrenschildt&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s home, he heard the shotgun blast that marked the suicide of the Russian, assuring that his relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald would never be fully understood.

By the way, that reporter&#x27;s name is Bill O&#x27;Reilly.

This claim has been disproven by Jefferson Morley, former editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who cites audio recordings made by Gaeton Fonzi indicating O&#x27;Reilly was not present in Florida on the day of Mohrenschildt&#x27;s suicide.

=== War coverage claims ===
On February 19, 2015, David Corn from &quot;Mother Jones&quot; broke a story reporting a collection of inconsistencies of O&#x27;Reilly when recalling his experience covering the 1982 Falklands War. On April 17, 2013, O&#x27;Reilly said on his show: &quot;I was in a situation one time, in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands, (...)&quot;. In his book, &quot;The No Spin Zone&quot;, he wrote: &quot;You know that I am not easily shocked. I&#x27;ve reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the Falklands.&quot; On a 2004 column on his website he wrote: &quot;Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash.&quot; Corn claimed O&#x27;Reilly was not in the Falklands, but was in Buenos Aires, and that no American journalist was in the Islands during the conflict. He also pointed out that according to O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s own book, &quot;The No Spin Zone&quot;, he arrived in Buenos Aires soon before the war ended. On February 20, 2015, O&#x27;Reilly said on his show, &quot;David Corn, a liar, says that I exaggerated situations in the Falklands War&quot; and that he never said he was on the Falkland Islands. O&#x27;Reilly went on to describe his experience in a riot in Buenos Aires the day Argentina surrendered. David Corn replied that they didn&#x27;t claim O&#x27;Reilly &quot;exaggerated&quot; but rather that there were contradictions between his accounts and the factual record and that the 2013 clip from his show proves O&#x27;Reilly did in fact say he was on the Falklands. Corn told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;The question is whether Bill O&#x27;Reilly was stating the truth when he repeatedly said that Argentine soldiers used real bullets and fired into the crowd of civilians and many were killed.&quot;

In September 2009, during an interview he said he covered the riots in Buenos Aires on the day Argentina surrendered.

During an interview with TheBlaze television network, O&#x27;Reilly said: &quot;And if that moron [Corn] doesn&#x27;t think it was a war zone in Buenos Aires, then he&#x27;s even dumber than I think he is.&quot; This characterization by O&#x27;Reilly was disputed by former CBS colleague Eric Engberg who was in Buenos Aires at the time and challenged his (O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s) description of the riot as a &quot;combat situation&quot;. Engberg went on to say it was a moderate riot and he heard no &quot;shots fired&quot; and saw no &quot;ambulances or tanks&quot; in the streets. The following week O&#x27;Reilly contradicted Engberg&#x27;s claims, presenting archived CBS video of the riot that ensued after Argentine&#x27;s surrender. The video appears to show riot police firing tear gas and plastic bullets toward the crowd; additionally, former NBC bureau chief Don Browne referred to the riot as an &quot;intense situation&quot; with many people hurt and tanks in the streets of Buenos Aires.

The fallout from the coverage generated by the questioning of O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s reporting during the Falklands War led to questions of claims made by O&#x27;Reilly while in El Salvador and Northern Ireland. In his 2013 book, &quot;Keep it Pithy&quot;, O&#x27;Reilly wrote: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen soldiers gun down unarmed civilians in Latin America, Irish terrorists kill and maim their fellow citizens in Belfast with bombs.&quot; In a 2005 radio program O&#x27;Reilly said he had &quot;seen guys gun down nuns in El Salvador&quot;. In 2012, on &quot;The O’Reilly Factor&quot;, he expanded, saying &quot;I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head.&quot; O&#x27;Reilly and Fox News clarified that he had not been an eyewitness to any of those events but had just seen photographs of the murdered nuns and Irish bombings.

== Legal issues ==
On October 13, 2004, O&#x27;Reilly sued Andrea Mackris, a former producer for &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, alleging extortion. O&#x27;Reilly claimed that Mackris had threatened a lawsuit unless he paid her more than $60 million. Later the same day, Mackris sued O&#x27;Reilly for sexual harassment, seeking $60 million in damages. Her complaint alleged that O&#x27;Reilly called her engaging in a crude phone conversation. On October 28, 2004, O&#x27;Reilly and Mackris reached an out-of-court settlement in which Mackris dropped her sexual-assault suit against O&#x27;Reilly and O&#x27;Reilly dropped his extortion claim against Mackris. The terms of the agreement are confidential, but in 2017 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that O&#x27;Reilly had agreed to pay Mackris about $9 million and that they would issue a public statement that there had been &quot;no wrongdoing whatsoever&quot;.

After Fox News executive Roger Ailes was the subject of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by former Fox News coworker Gretchen Carlson, O&#x27;Reilly said in July 2016, that Ailes was a &quot;target&quot; as a &quot;famous, powerful or wealthy person&quot; and called him the &quot;best boss I ever had&quot;. After Ailes was fired and the network settled the lawsuit with Carlson, O&#x27;Reilly declined to comment further, saying that &quot;for once in my life, I&#x27;m going to keep my big mouth shut.&quot;

Shortly after Ailes was fired, Fox News settled a sexual harassment claim against O&#x27;Reilly with former Fox host Juliet Huddy. Huddy alleged that O&#x27;Reilly pursued a romantic relationship with her and made lewd remarks. Legal fees in this case were settled and paid for by Fox News. The settlement was worth $1.6 million. In August 2016, former Fox host Andrea Tantaros filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News, claiming that O&#x27;Reilly made sexually suggestive comments to her. Judge George B. Daniels dismissed the lawsuit in May 2018 and wrote that Tantaros&#x27; allegations were &quot;primarily based on speculation and conjecture&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in April 2017 that O&#x27;Reilly and Fox News had settled five lawsuits against O&#x27;Reilly dating back to 2002. Previously, only the settlements to Mackris and Huddy were publicly reported; &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Fox hosts Rebecca Diamond and Laurie Dhue settled sexual harassment lawsuits in 2011 and 2016 respectively, and junior producer Rachel Witlieb Bernstein settled with Fox in 2002 after accusing O&#x27;Reilly of verbal abuse. The amount paid to the women filing the complaints was estimated at $13 million.

In October 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that O&#x27;Reilly was also sued by former Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl for allegedly initiating a &quot;non-consensual sexual relationship&quot; with her. O&#x27;Reilly paid Wiehl $32 million to confidentially settle the lawsuit, and when the details of this settlement were leaked, O&#x27;Reilly was dropped by the United Talent Agency. His literary agent, WME, also announced that they would no longer represent him for future deals after the October report.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Reilly is a Catholic. He was married to Maureen E. McPhilmy, a public relations executive. The couple met in 1992, and their wedding took place in St. Brigid Parish of Westbury, New York, on November 2, 1996. O&#x27;Reilly and McPhilmy have a daughter Madeline (b. 1998) and a son Spencer (b. 2003).

The couple separated on April 2, 2010, and were divorced on September 1, 2011.

In May 2015, court transcripts from O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s custody trial with ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy revealed an allegation of domestic violence. Following this allegation, O&#x27;Reilly issued a statement through his attorney describing the account as &quot;100% false&quot; and declined to comment further in order &quot;to respect the court-mandated confidentiality put in place to protect [his] children&quot;. In February 2016, O&#x27;Reilly lost a bid for sole custody of both of his children.

<doc id="188571" wikidata="Q375068" url="?curid=188571" title="Charles, Comte de Flahaut">
<text>Auguste Charles Joseph de Flahaut de La Billarderie, Comte de Flahaut (; 21 April 17851 September 1870) was a French general during the Napoleonic Wars, a senator, and later in his life, a French ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s. He had a son with Napoleon&#x27;s stepdaughter, Hortense de Beauharnais.

==Biography==
He was born in Paris, officially the son of maréchal de camp Charles-François de Flahaut de La Billarderie, comte de Flahaut (second son of Charles-César, marquis de La Billarderie) who was guillotined at Arras in February 1793, and his wife, Adélaïde Filleul. The first wife of his father was Françoise-Louise Poisson, sister of the Marquise de Pompadour of Château de Menars.

However, Charles de Flahaut was generally recognized to be the offspring of his mother&#x27;s liaison with Talleyrand, with whom he was closely connected throughout his life. His mother took him with her into exile in 1792, and they remained abroad until 1798, moving from England to Switzerland (where she is rumoured to have &quot;become involved&quot; with Louis-Philippe, then Duke of Orleans), before Hamburg where she met her second husband, Ambassador Dom José Maria do Carmo de Sousa Botelho Mourão e Vasconcelos, 5.º Morgado de Mateus.

Charles de Flahaut volunteered for military service joining the cavalry in 1800, and received his army commission after the Battle of Marengo. He was appointed &quot;Aide-de-camp&quot; to Joachim Murat, 1st Prince Murat, was present at the Battle of Austerlitz, and was wounded at the Battle of Landbach in 1805. At the same time, Flahaut was involved in a liaison with Napoleon&#x27;s younger sister, Caroline Bonaparte.

At Warsaw he met Anne Poniatowska, Countess Potocka with whom he quickly became intimate. After the Battle of Friedland, he was awarded the Legion of Honour and returned to Paris in 1807. He served in Spain in 1808, and then in Germany, reaching the rank of Colonel in that campaign. After the Battle of Wagram, general Louis-Alexandre Berthier made him his Aide-de-camp, leaving the staff of Murat, and awarded him the empty title of Baron of the Empire.

Meanwhile, the Countess Potocka had established herself in Paris, but Flahaut had by this time entered into a relationship with Hortense de Beauharnais, wife of Emperor Napoleon&#x27;s younger brother and King of Holland Louis Bonaparte; the birth of their son was registered in Paris on 21 October 1811 as Charles-Auguste-Louis-Joseph Demorny, later created Duc de Morny. Hortense was the daughter of Empress Josephine, and stepdaughter and sister-in-law of Napoleon.

Flahaut fought with distinction in the Russian Campaign of 1812 and took part in the French occupation of Moscow. In 1813, he was appointed Brigadier-General and Aide-de-camp to Emperor Napoleon, being promoted, after the Battle of Leipzig, as a Général de division and Adjutant general. In 1813, he was selected to meet the King of Saxony and conduct him to his capital. After the Battle of Dresden, he was made Count by Napoleon, and fought at the Battle of Hanau against the Bavarians.

After Napoleon&#x27;s abdication in 1814, he submitted to the new French government, but was placed on the retired list in September. He refused to betray Napoleon despite the efforts of the Bourbons to rally him in their service. Flahaut was assiduous in his attendance on Queen Hortense de Beauharnais until the Hundred Days brought him back into active service. With the return of Napoleon from the island of Elba, Flahaut joined his campaign to Paris and was placed in charge of reforming the army to the Emperor&#x27;s standard.

A mission to Vienna to secure the return of Empress Marie-Louise of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine resulted in failure. He was present at the Battle of Waterloo (as an Aide-de-camp to Napoleon), and afterwards sought to place Napoleon II on the throne.
He was spared exile due to an intervention by Talleyrand, but was placed under police surveillance. Flahaut then chose to leave for Germany, and thence to Britain.

The Flahauts returned to France in 1827 and, in 1830, King Louis-Philippe of the House of Bourbon-Orléans promoted the Count to the rank of Lieutenant-General as well as creating him a Peer of France. He remained a staunch supporter of Talleyrand&#x27;s policies, and in 1831 served briefly as French Ambassador to Berlin.
Subsequently, he was attached to the household of Ferdinand-Philippe of France, Duke of Orléans and, in 1841, was posted as Ambassador to Vienna, where he remained until 1848, when he was dismissed and retired from army service.

After the &quot;Coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 1851 by Napoleon III, his services were re-engaged, and from 1860 to 1862 he served in Britain as French Ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s under Queen Victoria.
In 1852, he became a Senator of the Second French Empire, and in 1854, he became a member of the Commission appointed to edit the works of Napoleon I. In 1864, the Flahauts returned to Paris and took up residence at the Hôtel de Salm, when Charles was appointed Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour. He died in Paris on 1 September 1870.

In the opinion of the unnamed author of a biography on Flahaut in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition: &quot;The comte de Flahaut is perhaps better remembered for his exploits in gallantry, and the elegant manners in which he had been carefully trained by his mother, than for his public services, which were not, however, so inconsiderable as they have sometimes been represented to be&quot;.

==Family==
Flahaut was the lover of Napoleon&#x27;s stepdaughter, Hortense de Beauharnais (Queen of Holland), with whom he had an illegitimate son, Charles de Morny (1811–1865) who later became Duc de Morny and married Sophia Sergeyevna Trubetskaya, a Russian princess of the House of Trubetskoy.

While in Britain, de Flahaut married in Edinburgh on 20 June 1817 Hon. Margaret Mercer Elphinstone (1788–1867), daughter of Admiral George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith; she succeeded, in her own right, as 2nd Baroness Keith in 1823 and 7th Lady Nairne in 1837.

They had five daughters:
*Emily Jane de Flahaut (16 May 181925 June 1895), married on 1 November 1843 to Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 4th Marquess of Lansdowne
*Clémentine de Flahaut (29 April 18215 January 1836), died unmarried
*Georgiana Gabrielle de Flahaut (182216 July 1907), married on 2 February 1871 to Jean Charles Marie Félix, Marquis de La Valette 
*Adélaïde Joséphine Elisabeth de Flahaut (18243 April 1841), died unmarried
*Sarah Sophie Louise de Flahaut (182510 June 1853), died unmarried

<doc id="188576" wikidata="Q378901" url="?curid=188576" title="Demonization">
<text>Demonization or demonisation is the reinterpretation of polytheistic deities as evil, lying demons by other religions, generally by the monotheistic and henotheistic ones. The term has since been expanded to refer to any characterization of individuals, groups, or political bodies as evil.

== Religion ==
Religions, even those that are radically monotheistic, do not necessarily deny the existence of other gods or spiritual beings. On the contrary, they claim some of the other gods are not worthy of worship and in actuality are demons who mislead followers from proper belief or practice. Christian missionaries often employed demonization tactics when converting pagans, although Judaism, Islam, and other religions have similar histories. Demonization is not limited to focusing on other religions but can also be directed inward to condemn various schools of thought or movements.

From a secular viewpoint, demonization can be used to denigrate an opposed individual or group, making adherents to one&#x27;s own religion or viewpoint less inclined to do business with them (and possibly convert) and more inclined to fight against them. If foreigners are evil and corrupted by demonic influence, then any means of self-defense is easily portrayed as legitimate. The portrayal of almost all pagans in the Middle East as Baal worshippers in the Hebrew Bible is an example of this. If pagans are corrupted by the demon &quot;god&quot; Baal, then clearly they must be fought or at least oppressed. Especially in the earlier books of the Hebrew Bible, foreign deities are portrayed as existing and corrupting entities rather than being mere powerless idols. Some would argue this later transferred to Christianity after Constantine I&#x27;s ascension in its suppression of Roman paganism. Some of the most known of these demonizations are Lucifer, Beelzebub and Baphomet up to the extent that they became synonymous with the devil/satan of Abrahamic religions. Later, the language of demonization would be invoked with the rise in Antisemitism in Iberia, leading to the Expulsion of Jews from Spain including the Moriscos.

The view of early Judaism treating foreign deities as devils and later Judaism treating them as nonexistent is not universal. Psalms 96:5, for example, is alternately translated as, &quot;For all the Gods of the gentiles are nothing,&quot; &quot;For all the Gods of the gentiles are devils&quot; (Vulgate), and &quot;For all the gods of the peoples are idols.&quot; (NRSV) The Greek Septuagint translation of that passage, used by the early Christian Church, used the &quot;devils&quot; version. Jerome would follow the Greek text rather than the Hebrew when he translated the Latin Vulgate edition of the Bible. The &quot;devils&quot; epithet would still appear in Bibles up until the end of the 20th century when the consensus reverted to the original Hebrew text for modern translations.

Analogs to demonization exist outside monotheistic religions, as well. Polytheism easily accepts foreign gods in general, and in times of conflict, a foreign nation&#x27;s gods would sometimes be portrayed as evil. Less commonly, it would be applied to other religions as well. For example, Buddha&#x27;s portrayal in Hinduism varies: Some strains of Hinduism consider the Buddha an incarnation of Vishnu while in some texts such as the Puranas, he is portrayed as an avatar born to mislead those who deny the Vedic knowledge.

=== Political conflicts ===
Demonization is sometimes used against what are arguably political opponents rather than religious ones. The Knights Templar were destroyed by accusations that they worshipped Baphomet from King Philip the Fair. Baphomet, often thought to be Beelzebub, may have been used because of the likeness of this horned deity with the Christian images of Satan.

== Modern usage ==
In colloquial usage, the term &quot;demonization&quot; is used metaphorically to refer to propaganda or moral panic directed against any individual or group, for the purpose of defamation, character assassination and/or dehumanization.

<text>Spice World is a 1998 music video game developed and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. It was released by Sony subsidiary Psygnosis in North America.

==Content==
With tracks like &quot;Wannabe&quot;, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;, &quot;Move Over&quot;, &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; and &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, each animated Spice Girl will offer a few comments as the player tours the game&#x27;s stages, experiencing a DJ and dance instructor that speak in stereotypical fashions. There are eleven dance moves applicable, each one a different combination of four buttons: six &quot;basic&quot; ones (the sway, shoulder shimmy, point and sway, knee wiggle, twirl, and shuffle) and five &quot;special&quot; moves (freestyle point, freestyle wave, hip wiggle, and side-jump). There is one button combination which triggers a backflip for Mel C and a walk and wave for the other Spice Girls. The game also contains a dozen interviews along with other entertaining moments, such as Geri Halliwell groping the buttocks of the then-Prince Charles, and the girls wreaking havoc on a Japanese talk-show.

In the game, players go through different stages to prepare the animated Spice Girls for a live television performance. The game starts out in the Mixing Room, where the player chooses the song the group will perform and the order each of its nine sections will be played. From the Mixing Room, the game then moves into Dance Practice, where the player gets to choreograph the dance routines for the group&#x27;s performance by hitting button combinations as they appear on the screen.

The player then records the routines by programming each animated Spice Girl&#x27;s dance steps one by one; routines recorded in one member of the group can also be copied to another member. When it is time for the show at the TV Studio, the player acts as the camera-person, choosing from eight different camera shots that can be moved in four directions; the player gets to watch the animated group sing and dance as the player has directed them to, with the camera shots selected by the player. This is followed by a 20-minute video footage of the actual Spice Girls being interviewed in the South of France. Throughout the game, the player is instructed by a disco king on what to do.

Up to 15 mixes, dance routines, and TV studio recordings can be saved on a single memory card.

==Development==
After seeing &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; (1997) attract new types of users to the PlayStation market in Japan, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe thought they could do the same with the European market by creating and releasing a music video game; this inspired them to convince 19 Entertainment to produce a game featuring the girl group Spice Girls, a brand with enough leverage to be endorsed by Walker&#x27;s Crisps, Pepsi Cola, and Asda. As the video game&#x27;s demographic was Spice Girls fans, who usually didn&#x27;t play video games, Sony&#x27;s plan from the start of development was to make it an &quot;interactive magazine&quot; where the player could be part of the girl group&#x27;s lifestyle.

Production of &quot;Spice World&quot; began in June 1997. &quot;Spice World&quot; was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe&#x27;s internal team at Soho, using the same lighting engine as their previous game &quot;Porsche Challenge&quot; (1997). The developers originally planned for a realistic art style where the Spice Girls were animated with motion capture; however, lead artist Jason Millson changed the plan to a more caricatured style where the characters were animated manually, reasoning that it enhanced their personalities. From Millson&#x27;s view, &quot;Spice World&quot; was the Spice Girls&#x27; version of the Beatles vanity project &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; (1968). Peter Eley, manager of the project, admitted that some staff didn&#x27;t take the project seriously: &quot;At first a lot of them weren&#x27;t that keen. Some of them viewed it as a bit of a ludicrous prospect.&quot;

The game was exhibited at the September 1997 European Computer Trade Show. Shortly before the game&#x27;s release date in June 1998, Geri Halliwell left the Spice Girls which led to concerns by Sony that &quot;Spice World&quot; would have to be pulled or revised. The company was later given permission by Halliwell&#x27;s lawyer to proceed with the game, two weeks before its scheduled release.

==Reception==

The video game was sold out in the United Kingdom within several months of its release. Unlike most Sony PlayStation games at the time which &quot;were almost exclusively bought by men,&quot; &quot;Spice World&quot; was mostly purchased by &quot;mothers and daughters&quot;. The game sold 75,000 copies.

Although a top-ten seller in the United Kingdom and garnering some reviews suggesting it would appeal to young fans of the Spice Girls, &quot;Spice World&quot; was generally critically panned as an inferior &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; game. Reviews panned its lack of substance and content, labeling it a non-gaming experience of only pressing buttons for a few minutes. &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that its limited amount of samples in the mixing feature, including &quot;few bridges&quot; and &quot;sung lines cut off halfway through,&quot; lead to &quot;choppy, amateurish&quot; tracks. J.C. Herz of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized &quot;Spice World&quot; for the same reason he disliked similar interactive music video games starring celebrity artists, for the mixture of &quot;recycled content with the illusion of choice, the fake empowerment of mixing your own version of someone else&#x27;s music with a keyboard or a joystick&quot;.

Critics also commented how it failed to capture the charm of the Spice Girls brand. Herz noted there wasn&#x27;t even a feature to alter the Spice Girls&#x27; attire, while &quot;GameSpot&quot; claimed they were &quot;transformed into personality-less cartoons, featuring only a few trademark idiosyncrasies.&quot; It also commented on the quality of the video segments: &quot;the shocking levels of video compression and the poorly-synched voice dubbing renders the footage barely watchable.&quot;

&quot;GamePro&quot; criticized the horrifying look of the 3D Spice Girls, &quot;clunky, confusing controls,&quot; and dances that &quot;are neither clear nor exciting.&quot;

<text>Betamax (also known as Beta, as in its logo) is a consumer-level analog recording and cassette format of magnetic tape for video, commonly known as a video cassette recorder. It was developed by Sony and was released in Japan on May 10, 1975, followed by the US in November of the same year.

Betamax is widely considered to be obsolete, having lost the videotape format war which saw its closest rival, VHS, dominate most markets. Betamax tapes initially had higher quality images over VHS if recorded at the base β1 speed; however, the speed was rarely offered on Beta VCRs manufactured after 1979, as the recording time of β1 on a standard Betamax tape was only 1 hour. Sony removed the β1 speed in favor of the slower speeds to closer compete with VHS’s base 2 hour record time. Because of this, the image quality advantage of Betamax over VHS was essentially removed throughout most of the format war.

Despite this, Betamax recorders continued to be manufactured and sold until August 2002, when Sony announced that they were discontinuing production of all remaining Betamax models. Sony continued to sell blank Betamax cassettes until March 2016.

==Original version==


===Launch and early models===
The first Betamax VCR introduced in the United States was the LV-1901 model, which included a Trinitron television, and appeared in stores in early November 1975. The cassettes contain videotape in a design similar to that of the earlier, professional , U-matic format.

Like the rival videotape format VHS (introduced in Japan by JVC in September 1976 and in the United States by RCA in August 1977), Betamax has no guard band and uses azimuth recording to reduce crosstalk. According to Sony&#x27;s history webpages, the name had a double meaning: &quot;beta&quot; is the Japanese word used to describe the way in which signals are recorded on the tape; and the shape of the lowercase Greek letter beta (β) resembles the course of the tape through the transport. The suffix &quot;-max&quot;, from the word &quot;maximum&quot;, was added to suggest greatness. In 1977, Sony issued the first long-play Betamax VCR, the SL-8200. This VCR had two recording speeds: normal, and the newer half speed. This provided two hours of recording on
the L-500 Beta videocassette. The SL-8200 was to compete against the VHS VCRs, which allowed up to 4, and later 6 and 8, hours of recording on one cassette.

Initially, Sony was able to tout several Betamax-only features, such as BetaScan—a high-speed picture search in either direction—and BetaSkipScan, a technique that allowed the operator to see where they were on the tape by pressing the FF key (or REW, if in that mode): the transport would switch into the BetaScan mode until the key was released. This feature is discussed in more detail on Peep Search. Sony believed that the M-Load transports used by VHS machines made copying these trick modes impossible. BetaSkipScan (Peep Search) is now available on miniature M-load formats, but even Sony was unable to fully replicate this on VHS. BetaScan was originally called &quot;Videola&quot; until the company that made the Moviola threatened legal action.

Sanyo marketed its own Betamax-compatible recorders under the Betacord brand (also casually referred to as &quot;Beta&quot;). In addition to Sony and Sanyo, Beta-format video recorders were manufactured and sold by Toshiba, Pioneer, Murphy, Aiwa, and NEC. Zenith Electronics and WEGA contracted with Sony to produce VCRs for their product lines. The department stores Sears (in the United States and Canada) and Quelle (in Germany) sold Beta-format VCRs under their house brands, as did the RadioShack chain of electronic stores.

===Industrial and professional usage===

Sony also offered a range of industrial Betamax products, a Beta I-only format for industrial and institutional users. These were aimed at the same market as U-Matic equipment, but were cheaper and smaller. The arrival of Betacam reduced the demand for both industrial Beta and U-Matic equipment.
For the professional and broadcast video industry, Sony derived Betacam from Betamax. Released in 1982, Betacam became the most widely used videotape format in ENG (electronic news gathering), replacing the wide U-matic tape format. Betacam and Betamax are similar in some ways- early versions of Betacam used the same video cassette shape, used the same oxide tape formulation with the same coercivity, and recorded linear audio tracks in the same location of the tape. However, in the key area of video recording, Betacam and Betamax use completely different on-tape formats.

Betamax also had a significant part to play in the music recording industry, when Sony introduced its PCM (pulse-code modulation) digital recording system as an encoding box/PCM adaptor that connected to a Betamax recorder. The Sony PCM-F1 adaptor was sold with a companion Betamax VCR SL-2000 as a portable digital audio recording system. Many recording engineers used this system in the 1980s and 1990s to make their first digital master recordings.

===Court case===

One other major consequence of the Betamax technology&#x27;s introduction to the U.S. was the lawsuit &quot;Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios&quot; (1984, the &quot;Betamax case&quot;), with the U.S. Supreme Court determining home videotaping to be legal in the United States, wherein home videotape cassette recorders were a legal technology since they had substantial noninfringing uses. This precedent was later invoked in &quot;MGM v. Grokster&quot; (2005), where the high court agreed that the same &quot;substantial noninfringing uses&quot; standard applies to authors and vendors of peer-to-peer file sharing software (notably excepting those who &quot;actively induce&quot; copyright infringement through &quot;purposeful, culpable expression and conduct&quot;).

==Later developments and offshoots==
===HiFi audio upgrade===
In June 1983, Sony introduced high fidelity audio to videotape as Beta Hi-Fi. For NTSC, Beta HiFi worked by placing a pair of FM carriers between the chroma (C) and luminance (Y) carriers, a process known as frequency multiplexing. Each head had a specific pair of carriers; in total, four individual channels were employed. Head A recorded its hi-fi carriers at 1.38(L) and 1.68(R) MHz, and the B head employed 1.53 and 1.83 MHz. The result was audio with an 80 dB dynamic range, with less than 0.005% wow and flutter.

Prior to the introduction of Beta Hi-Fi, Sony shifted the Y carrier up by 400 kHz to make room for the four FM carriers that would be needed for Beta Hi-Fi. All Beta machines incorporated this change, plus the ability to hunt for a lower frequency pre-AFM Y carrier. Sony incorporated an &quot;antihunt&quot; circuit, to stop the machine hunting for a Y carrier that was not there.

Some Sony NTSC models were marketed as &quot;Hi-Fi Ready&quot; (with an SL-HFR prefix to the model&#x27;s number instead of the usual SL or SL-HF). These Betamax decks looked like a regular Betamax model, except for a special 28-pin connector on the rear. If the user desired a Beta Hi-Fi model but lacked the funds at the time, he could purchase an &quot;SL-HFRxx&quot; and at a later date purchase the separate Hi-Fi Processor. Sony offered two outboard Beta Hi-Fi processors, the HFP-100 and HFP-200. They were identical except that the HFP-200 was capable of multi-channel TV sound, with the word &quot;stereocast&quot; printed after the Beta Hi-Fi logo. This was possible because unlike a VHS Hi-Fi deck, an NTSC Betamax did not need an extra pair of heads. The HFP-x00 would generate the needed carriers which would be recorded by the attached deck, and during playback, the AFM carriers would be passed to the HFP-x00. They also had a small &quot;fine tracking&quot; control on the rear panel for difficult tapes.

For PAL, however, the bandwidth between the chroma and luminance carriers was not sufficient to allow additional FM carriers, so depth multiplexing was employed, wherein the audio track would be recorded in the same way that the video track was. The lower-frequency audio track was written first by a dedicated head, and the video track recorded on top by the video head. The head disk had an extra pair of audio-only heads with a different azimuth, positioned slightly ahead of the regular video heads, for this purpose.

Sony was confident that VHS could not achieve the same audio performance feat as Beta Hi-Fi. However, to the chagrin of Sony, JVC did develop a VHS hi-fi system on the principle of depth multiplexing approximately a year after the first Beta Hi-Fi VCR, the SL-5200 was introduced by Sony. Despite initial praise as providing &quot;CD sound quality&quot;, both Beta Hi-Fi and VHS HiFi suffered from &quot;carrier buzz&quot;, where high-frequency information bled into the audio carriers, creating momentary &quot;buzzing&quot; and other audio flaws. Both systems also used companding noise-reduction systems, which could create &quot;pumping&quot; artifacts under some conditions. Both formats also suffered from interchange problems, where tapes made on one machine did not always play back well on other machines. When this happened and if the artifacts became too distracting, users were forced to revert to the old linear soundtrack.

===SuperBetamax / Hi-Band ===
In early 1985, Sony would introduce a new feature, Hi-Band or SuperBeta, by again shifting the Y carrier—this time by 800 kHz. This improved the bandwidth available to the Y sideband and increased the horizontal resolution from 240 to 290 lines on a regular-grade Betamax cassette. Since over-the-antenna and cable signals were only 300–330 lines resolution, SuperBeta could make a nearly identical copy of live television. However, the chroma resolution still remained relatively poor, limited to just under 0.4 MHz or approximately 30 lines resolution, whereas live broadcast chrominance resolution was over 100 lines. The heads were also narrowed to 29 μm to reduce crosstalk, with a narrower head gap to play back the higher carrier frequency at 5.6 MHz. Later, some models would feature further improvement, in the form of Beta-Is, a high band version of the Beta-I recording mode. There were some incompatibilities between the older Beta decks and SuperBeta, but most could play back a high band tape without major problems. SuperBeta decks had a switch to disable the SuperBeta mode for compatibility purposes. (SuperBeta was only marginally supported outside of Sony, as many licensees had already discontinued their Betamax line.)

===ED-Beta (Extended Definition Betamax) ===

In 1988, Sony would again push the envelope with ED-Beta, or &quot;Extended Definition&quot; Betamax, capable of up to 500 lines of luma resolution, comparable to then-future DVD quality. In order to store the ~6.5 MHz-wide luma signal, with the peak frequency at 9.3 MHz, Sony used a metal formulation tape borrowed from the Betacam SP format (branded &quot;ED-Metal&quot;) and incorporated some improvements to the transport to reduce mechanically induced aberrations in the picture. ED-Beta also featured a luminance carrier deviation of 2.5 MHz, as opposed to the 1.2 MHz used in SuperBeta, improving contrast with reduced luminance noise. Chroma resolution remained unchanged, which made artifacts like color fringing more pronounced. To cancel chroma signal crosstalk, the chroma portion of the signal was delayed by one or two scan lines during playback, smearing the color even more. The chroma delay could be disabled on higher end VCRs by turning on EDIT mode to &quot;reduce editing faults&quot; when dubbing a tape.

Sony introduced two ED decks and a camcorder in the late 1980s. The top end EDV-9500 (EDV-9300 in Canada) deck was a very capable editing deck, rivaling much more expensive U-Matic set-ups for its accuracy and features, but did not have commercial success due to lack of timecode and other pro features. Sony did market ED-Beta to &quot;semiprofessional&quot; users, or &quot;s&quot;. As for the EDC-55 &quot;ED CAM&quot; camcorder, the major complaint concerned its low light sensitivity due to the use of two CCDs instead of the typical single-CCD imaging device. ED-Beta machines only recorded in βII and βIII modes, with the ability to play back βI and βIs.

===Portable equipment and Betamovie camcorders===

Two-piece portable video systems (those featuring a portable VCR such as Sony&#x27;s &quot;BetaPak&quot;) and a separate camera) soon became available for amateur and low-end video production. To better compete with Super 8 film there was the need for a less cumbersome all-in-one solution, and Sony&#x27;s was &quot;Betamovie&quot;, the first consumer camcorder.

Betamovie used standard-size Betamax cassettes. However, the changes required to miniaturise the mechanism forced the use of non-standard record signal timing. As a result, while the final on-tape recording is – by design – in standard Betamax format and playable on a regular Beta deck, the camcorder itself is record-only, and cannot be used to review or play back footage. (This also effectively restricted Betamovie to those who also owned or had access to the Beta VCRs needed to view recordings).
VHS manufacturers found a different solution to drum miniaturization using standard video signals instead, permitting footage to be reviewed on the camcorder itself, and output to another VCR for editing. This was a huge advantage, as even owners of Beta VCRs could use a VHS camcorder to copy and edit footage to their Beta deck- something not possible with Betamovie.

VHS gained another advantage with VHS-C, which used a miniaturized cassette to make a camcorder smaller and lighter than any Betamovie. Sony could not duplicate the functionality of VHS-C camcorders, and seeing the rapid loss of market share, eventually introduced the Video8 format. Their hope was that Video8 could replace both Beta and VHS for all uses.

SuperBeta and industrial Betamovie camcorders would also be sold by Sony.

==Discontinuation and legacy==
===End of production ===
On November 10, 2015, Sony announced that it would no longer be producing Betamax video cassettes. Production and sales ended March 2016 after almost 41 years of continuous production. Third-party manufacturers continue to make new cassettes. While these cassettes are designed for use with the Betacam format, the cassettes are interchangeable with traditional Betamax systems.

Despite the sharp decline in sales of Betamax recorders in the late 1980s and subsequent halt in production of new recorders by Sony in 2002, Betamax, SuperBetamax and ED-Beta are still being used by a small number of people. Even though Sony stopped making new cassettes in 2016, new old stocks of Betamax cassettes are still available for purchase at online shops and used recorders (as well as cassettes) are often found at flea markets, thrift stores or on Internet auction sites. Early format Betacam cassettes—which are physically based on the Betamax cassette—continue to be available for use in the professional media. It is still used by few broadcasters, as it was succeeded by Betacam SP, its digital modifications and more recently by tapeless recording.

===Legacy===
The VHS format&#x27;s defeat of the Betamax format became a classic marketing case study. Sony&#x27;s attempt to dictate an industry standard backfired when JVC made the tactical decision to forgo Sony&#x27;s offer of Betamax in favor of developing its own technology. JVC felt that accepting Sony&#x27;s offer would yield results similar to the U-Matic deal, with Sony dominating.

By 1980, JVC&#x27;s VHS format controlled 60% of the North American market. The large economy of scale allowed VHS units to be introduced to the European market at a far lower cost than the rarer Betamax units. In the United Kingdom, Betamax held a 25% market share in 1981, but by 1986, it was down to 7.5% and continued to decline further. By 1984, 40 companies made VHS format equipment in comparison with Beta&#x27;s 12. Sony finally conceded defeat in 1988 when it, too, began producing VHS recorders (early models were made by Hitachi), though it still continued to produce Betamax recorders until 2002.

In Japan, Betamax had more success and eventually evolved into Extended Definition Betamax, with 500+ lines of resolution.

==Technical details==
===Comparison with other video formats===

The heads on the drum of a Betamax VCR move across the tape producing a writing speed of 6.9 or 5.832 metres per second with the drum rotating at 1800 rpm (NTSC, 60 Hz) or 1500 rpm (PAL, 50 Hz), theoretically giving Betamax a higher bandwidth of 3.2 MHz, thus better video quality than VHS. The tape moves at 2 cm/sec (βII, 60 Hz), 1.33 cm/sec (βIII, 60 Hz) or 1.873 cm/sec (50 Hz). The original βI speed was 4 cm/sec.

Below is a list of modern, digital-style resolutions (and traditional analog &quot;TV lines per picture height&quot; measurements) for various media. The list only includes popular formats. Listed resolution applies to luminance only, with chroma resolution usually halved in each dimension for digital formats, and significantly lower for analog formats.

Equivalent pixel resolutions are calculated from analog line resolution numbers:

The somewhat unintuitive analog resolution loss for 16:9 DVD compared to 4:3 DVD arises because analog resolution unit is &quot;lines per picture height&quot;. When picture height is kept the same, the same 720 pixels are spread to a wider area in 16:9, hence lower horizontal resolution per picture height.

=== Tape lengths ===
Both NTSC and PAL/SECAM Betamax cassettes are physically identical (although the signals recorded on the tape are incompatible). However, as tape speeds differ between NTSC and PAL/SECAM, the playing time for any given cassette will vary accordingly between the systems. Other unusual lengths were produced from time to time, such as L-410.

* For NTSC only, βI is standard speed, βII is 1/2 speed, βIII is 1/3 speed.

==In popular culture==
In the 1983 David Cronenberg film &quot;Videodrome&quot;, the character of Max Renn grows an opening in his stomach that accepts Betamax videocassettes. The Betamax format was chosen because the cassettes were slightly smaller than VHS cassettes, and thus made the prosthetics easier to construct.

In the 2006 episode of Doctor Who entitled The Idiot’s Lantern, the Tenth Doctor beats the episode’s main enemy and entraps her for all eternity in a videotape he created thirty years too early as the episode is set in 1953. He shrugs off the effect it will have on the timelines as he calls it “just Betamax”.

In the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; episode &quot;Speak Like a Child&quot;, Jet and Spike receive a Beta tape in the mail intended for Faye. Jet and Spike visit a shop in hopes of finding a Betamax player, which they do, but it is subsequently damaged beyond repair by Spike’s impatience with the old device.

In the 2008 Pixar movie &quot;WALL-E&quot;, WALL-E watches some excerpts of the film &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; on what is presumed to be an old Betamax tape. However close inspection of the shot shows that it is really a BetacamSP cassette, which may be an error on the filmmakers&#x27; part.

The Tagalog song &quot;Betamax&quot; by the Filipino band Sandwich from their fifth studio album in 2008 entitled &quot;Marks the Spot&quot; talks about an era in the Philippines before the advent of the Internet, MP3s, and DVDs, and the only widespread video format was Betamax. Also in the Philippines, Betamax refers to the popular cubed street food made of chicken or pork&#x27;s blood served in skewers which bear a crude resemblance to Betamax cartridges.

In 2017, in Despicable Me 3, the villain Balthazar Bratt, whose look, culture, accessories and weapons date from the 80&#x27;s, yells &quot;Son of a Beta max&quot; at his opponent Gru.

In 2019, episode 3, season 1 of Good Omens (Amazon Prime series), a prophecy is mentioned from the book of Agnes Nutter book of prophecies saying: &quot;Do not buy Betamax,&quot; and referring to the year 1972.

<text>Voltron is an American animated television series franchise that features a team of space explorers who pilot a giant super robot known as &quot;Voltron&quot;. Produced by Peter Keefe (executive producer) and Ted Koplar through his production company World Events Productions, Voltron was an adaptation of several Japanese anime television series from Toei Animation. The original television series aired in syndication from September 10, 1984, to November 18, 1985. The first season of &quot;Voltron&quot;, featuring the &quot;Lion Force Voltron&quot;, was adapted from the series &quot;Beast King GoLion&quot;. The second season, featuring the &quot;Vehicle Team Voltron&quot;, was adapted from the unrelated series &quot;Armored Fleet Dairugger XV&quot;.

&quot;Voltron: Defender of the Universe&quot; was the top-rated syndicated children&#x27;s show for two years during its original run, and it spawned three follow-up series, several comic books, and a line of toys.

==Television series==
===Lion Force Voltron (&quot;Voltron of the Far Universe&quot;; &quot;Voltron III&quot;)===

The first series was primarily edited from &quot;Beast King GoLion&quot; (), and it features a team of five young pilots commanding five robot lions which can be combined to form Voltron. In this undefined future era, the Voltron Force is in charge of protecting the planet Arus (ruled by Princess Allura) from the evil King Zarkon (from planet Doom), his son Lotor, and the witch Haggar, who creates huge &quot;ro-beasts&quot; to terrorize the Arusian people. Despite being the first of the two robots to appear on American television, the &quot;GoLion&quot; version of Voltron was regarded as &quot;&quot;Voltron III&quot; within the storyline because, within the original planned three-Voltron continuity, Arus was the furthest setting from Earth&#x27;s side of the universe (&quot;Voltron I&quot; being intended for the Near Universe, and &quot;Voltron II&quot;&quot; being intended for the Middle Universe).

===Vehicle Team Voltron (&quot;Voltron of the Near Universe&quot;; &quot;Voltron I&quot;)===
The second series, colloquially dubbed &quot;Car Voltron&quot;, was primarily edited from &quot;Armored Fleet Dairugger XV&quot; (), with the storyline considerably changed. In this iteration of &quot;Voltron&quot;, the Galaxy Alliance&#x27;s home planets are now overcrowded, and a fleet of explorers is sent to search for new planets to colonize. Along the way, they attract the attention of the evil Drule Empire, long engaged in an ongoing war against the Alliance, and the Drule proceed to interfere with the mission of the explorers and the colonists. Since the Arusian Voltron is too far away to help these explorers, a totally new Voltron has to be constructed to battle the Drule threat.

This Voltron Force consists of fifteen members, divided into three teams of five, known respectively as the Land, Sea, and Air Teams. Each team is specialized in gathering data or fighting in their area of expertise. Each team can combine their vehicles into a bigger machine. When necessary, all fifteen vehicles combine to form the mighty Voltron. However, the Vehicle Team Voltron only had enough stored energy to operate for five minutes at a time.

In the toy line, this Voltron was referred to as &quot;Voltron I&quot; because it was set closest to Earth.

===Gladiator Voltron (&quot;Voltron of the Middle Universe&quot;; &quot;Voltron II&quot;)===
The proposed third season was to have been based on . The series would have centered around three teenage geniuses who each created a humanoid robot that were then modified for battle to combat an alien threat. Unlike the Lion Force Voltron or the Vehicle Force Voltron, both of whom were composed of machines that combined to form them, Gladiator Voltron&#x27;s three components actually disassembled and reassembled into one large robot. This allowed for multiple different combinations with different functions and skills depending on the situation. There were also three jets that the team members would fly into hatches on the backs of their robots to pilot them that could also combine into one large jet, which were later replaced with other jets that could transform into smaller bipedal robots and could also combine to form a larger robot. Although Matchbox did produce and market toy versions of the three robots (Black Alpha, Blue Beta, Red Gamma) under the &quot;Voltron II&quot; name, the series never actually aired. Due to the extreme popularity of the Lion Force Voltron and the lack of popularity of the Vehicle Team Voltron series, World Events Productions eventually elected against another alternate Voltron, and plans to adapt &quot;Albegas&quot; were aborted.

===&quot;Voltron: Fleet of Doom&quot; (1986)===

In 1986, World Events hired Toei Animation to produce the one-off crossover television special &quot;Voltron: Fleet of Doom&quot;, which mixed in &quot;GoLion&quot; and &quot;Dairugger XV&quot; footage with new animation. The special was made for the international market and, as of the middle of September 2016, it had not been released in Japan.

===&quot;Voltron: The Third Dimension&quot; (1998–2000)===

The computer-generated series &quot;Voltron: The Third Dimension&quot; was released in 1998, set five years after the end of the original Lion Voltron series. The series was met with a mixed response, due to various changes, such as the revamped looks of the Lion Voltron, King Zarkon, and Prince Lotor. The series served as a sequel to the Lion Force Voltron series; among the tools used to bridge the gap between the two series was an official starmap as designed by Shannon Muir and finalized in partnership with World Events Productions. After &quot;Voltron: The Third Dimension&quot;, World Events Productions went back to the drawing board to develop a more traditionally animated series in an attempt to recapture the spirit of the original.

===&quot;Voltron Force&quot; (2011–2012)===

The animated series &quot;Voltron Force&quot; premiered on Nicktoons in June 2011. The series follows the exploits of a group of three young cadets brought together by the original members of the Voltron Force to defend the galaxy against a resurrected Lotor, now ruling the planet Drule after a military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. &quot;Voltron Force&quot; is a World Events Production in conjunction with Kick Start Productions and Classic Media.

===&quot;Voltron: Legendary Defender&quot; (2016–2018)===

The Netflix exclusive series &quot;Voltron: Legendary Defender&quot;, produced by DreamWorks Animation, is a reboot of the Voltron story. The series premiered on June 10, 2016, with Joaquim Dos Santos and Lauren Montgomery serving as showrunners. On January 5, 2016, Netflix announced that &quot;Voltron&quot; would debut in 2016 as an original animated Netflix series in partnership with DreamWorks Animation (DWA), part of an expanded multi-year agreement between the two groups. In February, teasers revealed the title of the new series to be &quot;Voltron: Legendary Defender&quot;. On March 25, 2016, a teaser trailer was released, announcing that the first season, consisting of 13 episodes, would premiere June 10, 2016. A second season premiered on Netflix on January 20, 2017. The third season premiered on Netflix on August 4, 2017, and consisted of 7 episodes while the fourth season premiered on October 13, 2017, and consisted of 6 episodes. The fifth season premiered on March 2, 2018, and consists of six episodes. The sixth season premiered on June 15, 2018, and consists of seven episodes. The seventh season premiered August 10, 2018 and consists of 13 episodes. The eighth and final season premiered on December 14, 2018, and consists of 13 episodes. The series&#x27; success has spawned several comics, action figures, and other toys.

==Live-action film==

In July 2005, producer Mark Gordon (&quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;) announced plans to create a live-action film adaptation of the &quot;Voltron&quot; franchise in collaboration with producers Pharrell Williams, Mark Costa, and Frank Oelman. Pharrell Williams was also reported to compose the musical score for the film. The project&#x27;s development was funded by Jim Young&#x27;s Animus Films. In December 2006, screenwriter Enzo Marra was announced to have completed a script for Gordon. In August 2007, the production entity New Regency entered negotiations with The Mark Gordon Company to adapt &quot;Voltron&quot;. Interest in the property heightened after the box office success of &quot;Transformers&quot;, another film involving shape-changing robots. Mark&#x27;s script was described as &quot;a post-apocalyptic tale set in New York City...[in which] five ragtag survivors of an alien attack band together and end up piloting the five lion-shaped robots that combine and form the massive sword-wielding Voltron that helps battle Earth&#x27;s invaders.&quot; On August 18, 2008, Relativity Media entered negotiations with New Regency to finance and produce the film, though on a more moderate budget, utilizing cost-saving CGI techniques such as those used in &quot;300&quot;. Max Makowski was slated to direct. As of the end of August 2008, the title had been set for &quot;Voltron: Defender of the Universe&quot;. Relativity would have released the film in North America while New Regency&#x27;s distribution partner, 20th Century Fox, would handle international distribution. But at that time, Ted Koplar, through his World Events Production Company (Koplar took over the company as the health of Peter Keefe declined; Keefe died in 2010 at age 57), was fighting a legal battle with Toei Company Ltd. over the movie rights as of November of that year. On September 16, 2010, concept art for the movie was released. On March 8, 2011, it was announced that Relativity Media and World Events had entered a bidding war on who would make the film. Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer entered into collaboration on writing the script. On July 21, 2011, Atlas Entertainment &amp; Relativity Media announced they would bring &quot;Voltron: Defender of the Universe&quot; to the big screen. Relativity Media would distribute. On July 30, 2015, Relativity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York after lawsuits and missing loan payments, and the film rights reverted to Classic Media. On November 4, 2016, three months after the completion of NBCUniversal&#x27;s acquisition of Classic Media&#x27;s parent company, DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion, it was announced that Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Animation will make the film with David Hayter writing the script.

In March 2022, it was announced that the live-action film was officially back in development with Rawson Marshall Thurber directing and co-writing the screenplay with Ellen Shanman, and produced by Todd Lieberman, David Hoberman, and Bob Koplar. The film also incited a bidding war between Warner Bros. Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Amazon Prime Video. Amazon is leading the bid. On August 1, it was confirmed that Amazon had acquired the rights. On October 3, newcomer Daniel Quinn-Toye was cast in a lead role. On October 10, it was reported that Henry Cavill would be joining the live action cast in an undisclosed role. On November 25, 2024, it was reported that Sterling K. Brown, Rita Ora and John Kim were cast in undisclosed roles. The next day, Alba Baptista, Samson Kayo and Tharanya Tharan were announced in undisclosed roles. It was announced that filming on the movie had begun.

==DVD releases==

In Australia, DVDs of all episodes of &quot;Voltron&quot; were released by Madman Entertainment as the 20th Anniversary Edition, Lion Force Voltron Collection. The original series was released in five volumes between August 2004 and July 2005, under the name &quot;Voltron: Defender of the Universe&quot;. Each box was in the color and style of one of the lions with a metallic glossy inner DVD-case. Another three volumes of &quot;Vehicle Team Voltron&quot; were released between August and December 2005.

Madman Entertainment has since relinquished the rights to the Voltron series and has since been re-released by Beyond Home Entertainment. Previous licensees of Voltron in Australia have been CBS/Fox Video and Manga Entertainment.

Prior to the release of the boxed sets, a promotional DVD was released for &quot;Voltron&quot;. It was packed in a threefold glossy cardboard folder. The folder featured full-color artwork and text about the then-upcoming release of &quot;Voltron&quot; on DVD. The disk had an image of Voltron, and was labeled for promotional use only.

Volume 1 of &quot;GoLion&quot; was released on May 27, 2008, Volume 2 on August 12, 2008, and Volume 3 on November 25, 2008. &quot;GoLion&quot; was re-released as a complete chronology set with all 52 episodes on April 13, 2010. The first &quot;Dairugger XV&quot; DVD collection was released on February 23, 2010, the second &quot;Dairugger XV&quot; collection was released on May 25, 2010. The third and final collection was originally scheduled to be released in September 2010, but was repeatedly delayed and finally released on January 4, 2011.

As of mid-2011, Classic Media (DreamWorks Classics) now owns the rights to Voltron on DVD.

On September 24, 2019, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released &quot;Voltron: Defender of the Universe: The Complete Collection&quot; on DVD in Region 1, which includes all 124 episodes and &quot;Fleet of Doom&quot;. The series is also scheduled for DVD releases in the UK, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany.

Following the success of &quot;&quot;, Netflix released 12 episodes of &quot;Defender of the Universe&quot; as &quot;Voltron &#x27;84&quot; on March 24, 2017. Each episode is introduced by members of the cast and crew of &quot;Legendary Defender&quot;.

===Soundtracks===
The Voltron television franchise has produced soundtracks for three of its series which have been released exclusively on the iTunes and the Google Play stores. The first soundtrack release was on September 27, 2012, for the original Lions series with music composed by John Petersen.

===2000s===

In 2002, comic book publisher Devil&#x27;s Due announced that it had acquired the rights to publish &quot;Voltron&quot; comic books. Devil&#x27;s Due, through Image Comics, published a five issue mini-series (preceded by a #0 issue from Dreamwave) which featured the Lion Voltron incarnation of the character and rebooted the property. This was then followed by an ongoing series self-published by Devil&#x27;s Due, which was placed on hiatus in 2005 after the eleventh issue, due to poor sales.

Devil&#x27;s Due announced in January 2008 that the five-issue mini-series, the eleven issues of the ongoing series, and the #0 issue would be collected into a Voltron Omnibus trade paperback that would also include the unpublished twelfth issue of the ongoing series that would wrap up all the storylines.

In July 2008, a new five issue mini-series was released by Devil&#x27;s Due, which picked up where the ongoing series left off. This series further explored the origins of Lion Voltron&#x27;s creation, from 12,000 years in the past to the present day. The mini-series showed Voltron existing as a single construct created by sorcerers and scientists, resembling a knight. During its battle with the first Drule Empire, Voltron was tricked by Haggar into landing on a black comet with the gravitational attraction of a singularity. Voltron was then attacked by Haggar, and blown into five pieces. However, the intervention of a sorcerer resulted in the five pieces becoming the five lions as they descended onto Arus.

The original five issue mini-series was adapted as the 2007 motion comic &quot;Voltron: Defenders of the Universe - Revelations&quot;. Its sequel, &quot;Voltron: Defenders of the Universe - Paradise Lost&quot;, adapted the first story arc of the ongoing series, introducing the V-15 and its pilots. The Devil&#x27;s Due run is now collected digitally exclusively through Devil&#x27;s Due Digital.

===2010s===
In 2011, Dynamite Entertainment announced plans to publish &quot;Voltron&quot; comics, while Viz Media&#x27;s young readers imprint, Viz Kids, announced plans to publish a series of graphic novels called &quot;Voltron Force&quot;, on which Bian Smith would serve as head writer, and Jacob Chabot and Dario Brizuela would serve as lead artists.

In September 2015, Dynamite released &quot;Voltron: From The Ashes&quot;, written by Cullen Bunn with art by Blacky Shepherd.

==Toys==
===Matchbox===
Matchbox imported the Lion Force Voltron, Gladiator Voltron, and Vehicle Force Voltron diecast toys from Popy of Japan in 1984. The company also released 6-inch figures of the Voltron robots that were more affordable, but lacked the detail level of their larger counterparts and could not separate into their component forms.

===Panosh Place===
At the peak of the series&#x27; popularity, Panosh Place released new &quot;Voltron&quot; toys, including action figures of the characters and a larger Voltron toy that could fit them.

===Trendmasters===
To coincide with the 1998 broadcast of &quot;Voltron: The Third Dimension&quot;, the now-defunct Trendmasters reissued the Matchbox diecast Lion Force Voltron, with a few changes to the mold and a total of 17 weapons in comparison to the original&#x27;s sword and shield. Trendmasters also released the newer Stealth Voltron and Voltrex variants at various sizes, as well as character action figures to go along with them. A dragon version of Voltron called Dracotron was prototyped but never made it to production.

===Toynami===
Shortly after the demise of Trendmasters, Toynami acquired the &quot;Voltron&quot; license and released their Masterpiece Voltron toy in 2005. Boasting more detail and articulation than the previous toys, the Masterpiece Voltron sold for US$139 to US$149.99 at the time of its release. In 2007, Toynami sold an all-plastic version of the Masterpiece Voltron for up to one-third of the first release&#x27;s price (ranging from US$49 to US$60). A variant of this version was packaged and sold with a Voltron line of Reebok sneakers. For the 25th anniversary of the cartoon franchise in 2009, the plastic Masterpiece Voltron was reissued in a metallic repaint.

===Mattel===
In late 2011, Mattel designed but never released toys for the new &quot;Voltron Force&quot; series, while its online collectors&#x27; site MattyCollector.com sold brand new toys for the classic series - including a 23-inch Voltron that fits 4-inch pilot figures in each lion.

===Playmates Toys===
In 2017, Playmates Toys released toys based on . Though only three pilot action figures were ever released before the line was terminated.

===Bandai===
In early 2017 Bandai Japan, who produced the toys of Beast King GoLion and Armored Fleet Dairugger XV back in their initial releases, released a Soul of Chogokin version of the GoLion robot. The box was repackaged as &quot;Voltron&quot; for its American release. A Dairugger XV version was later produced in 2019, similarly branded as &quot;Vehicle Voltron&quot; in the US release. WEP purchased the rights to the original Dairugger XV as well as Albegas and Golion some time previously, so Bandai had to relicense the toys back from WEP to produce them.

===Lego===
In August 2017, Lego announced that a forthcoming Lego Ideas set based upon classic Voltron will be placed into production. The set was released on August 1, 2018, coinciding with the final seasons of &quot;Voltron: Legendary Defender&quot;.

==Other merchandise==
Privateer Press released a &quot;Voltron: Defender of the Universe&quot; expansion set for their Monsterpocalypse battle miniatures game series in 2010.

In 2012, Voltron was shown in MetLife&#x27;s &quot;Everyone&quot; commercial during Super Bowl XLVI.

In 2023, 4 Hands Brewing Company, based in WEP LLC&#x27;s hometown of St. Louis, launched a six-part, two-year licensed series of &quot;Voltron&quot;-themed beers, each &quot;volume&quot; a collaboration with a different craft brewery.

==Video games==
===&quot;Voltron: Defender of the Universe&quot; (2011)===

In December 2009, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment announced the first ever &quot;Voltron&quot; video game would be released on mobile phones in the US, including the iPhone. The game would have 30 levels and 6 acts, isometric gameplay and gamers will command robot lions to traverse the galaxy and take on King Zarkon&#x27;s evil droid armies. In 2011, &quot;&quot;, produced by THQ and Behaviour Interactive, was developed for home console play. A 1-5 player co-op game, it was released on November 29, 2011, for the PlayStation Network and November 30, 2011, for the Xbox Live Arcade. The First Trailer has been announced on IGN.com and tentatively priced at $10. Players will be able fight as the individual lions in an overhead shooter style gameplay to then form Voltron to take on Robeasts in a fighter style combat.

===&quot;Voltron: Cubes of Olkarion&quot; (2019)===
In 2018, NBCUniversal announced the video game &quot;Voltron: Cubes of Olkarion&quot;, the winner of their developer competition &quot;Universal GameDev Challenge&quot; that had offered game developers the opportunity to use some of Universal&#x27;s IP. In 2019, &quot;Voltron: Cubes of Olkarion&quot;, produced by indie game studio Gbanga, was made published on the Steam store in Early Access, the platform&#x27;s experimental game program. In the game, players compete in real-time player vs player (PvP) game battles by placing own and destroying opponent blocks with different features in a game board with a grid.

<doc id="188587" wikidata="Q5421977" url="?curid=188587" title="Messiah in Judaism">
<text>The Messiah in Judaism () is a savior and liberator figure in Jewish eschatology who is believed to be the future redeemer of the Jews. The concept of messianism originated in Judaism, and in the Hebrew Bible a messiah is a king or High Priest of Israel traditionally anointed with holy anointing oil.

However, messiahs were not exclusively Jewish, as the Hebrew Bible refers to Cyrus the Great, an Achaemenid emperor, as a messiah for his decree to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple.

In Jewish eschatology, the Messiah is a future Jewish king from the Davidic line, who is expected to be anointed with holy anointing oil and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age and world to come. The Messiah is often referred to as &quot;King Messiah&quot; (, ).

Jewish messianism gave birth to Christianity, which started as a Second Temple period messianic Jewish religious movement.

==Etymology==
In Jewish eschatology, the term Messiah refers specifically to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line, who is expected to save the Jewish nation and will be anointed with holy anointing oil and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. The Messiah is often referred to as King Messiah. In a generalized sense, messiah has &quot;the connotation of a savior or redeemer who would appear at the end of days and usher in the kingdom of God, the restoration of Israel, or whatever dispensation was considered to be the ideal state of the world.&quot;

Messianism &quot;denotes a movement, or a system of beliefs and ideas, centered on the expectation of the advent of a messiah.&quot; Orthodox views hold that the Messiah will be a blood descendent from the Davidic line through his father, and will gather the Jews back into the Land of Israel, usher in an era of peace, build the Third Temple, father a male heir, re-institute the Sanhedrin, and so on. However, the word &quot;Mashiach&quot; is rarely used in Jewish literature from the 1st century BCE to the 1st-century CE.

The Jewish tradition of the late or early post-Second Temple period alludes to two redeemers, one suffering and the second fulfilling the traditional messianic role, namely ben Yosef and ben David. Messiah unqualified refers to ben David.

Belief in the future advent of the Messiah was first recorded in the Talmud and later codified in halakha by Maimonides in the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; as one of the fundamental requisites of the Jewish faith, concerning which it has been written: &quot;Anyone who does not believe in him, or who does not wait for his arrival, has not merely denied the other prophets, but has also denied the Torah and Moses, our Rabbi.&quot;

==Origins and history==

===Pre-exile Jewish eschatology (8th–6th cent. BCE)===

The roots of Jewish eschatology are to be found in the pre-exile prophets, including Isaiah and Jeremiah, and the exile prophets Ezekiel and Deutero-Isaiah. The main tenets of Jewish eschatology are the following, in no particular order, elaborated in the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel:
* End of world (before everything as follows).
* God redeems the Jewish people from the captivity that began during the Babylonian captivity, in a new Exodus
* God returns the Jewish people to the Land of Israel
* God restores the House of David and the Temple in Jerusalem
* God creates a regent from the House of David (i.e. the Jewish Messiah) to lead the Jewish people and the world and usher in an age of justice and peace
* All nations recognize that the God of Israel is the only true God
* God resurrects the dead
* God creates a new heaven and a new earth

===Second Temple period (516 BCE–70 CE)===

Early in the Second Temple period, hopes for a better future are described in the Jewish scriptures. After the return from the Babylonian exile, the Persian king Cyrus the Great was called &quot;messiah&quot; in Isaiah, due to his role in the return of the Jewish exiles.

Some messianic ideas developed during the later Second Temple period, ranging from this-worldly, political expectations to apocalyptic expectations of an end time in which the dead would be resurrected, and the Kingdom of Heaven would be established on earth. The Messiah might be a kingly &quot;Son of David,&quot; or a more heavenly &quot;son of man&quot;, but &quot;Messianism became increasingly eschatological, and eschatology was decisively influenced by apocalypticism&quot;, while &quot;messianic expectations became increasingly focused on the figure of an individual savior.&quot; According to R. J. Zwi Werblowsky, &quot;the Messiah no longer symbolized the coming of the new age, but he was somehow supposed to bring it about.&quot; The &quot;Lord&#x27;s anointed&quot; thus became the &quot;savior and redeemer&quot; and the focus of more intense expectations and doctrines.&quot; Messianic ideas developed both by new interpretations (&quot;pesher&quot;, &quot;midrash&quot;) of the Jewish scriptures but also by visionary revelations.

====Apocalypticism====
=====Messiah in apocalypticism=====

Religious views on whether Hebrew Bible passages refer to a Messiah may vary among scholars of ancient Israel, looking at their meaning in their original contexts and among rabbinical scholars. The reading of messianic attestations in passages from Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel is anachronistic because messianism developed later than these texts. According to James C. VanderKam, there are no Jewish texts before the 2nd century BCE that mention a messianic leader, though some terms point in this direction. Some terms, such as the servant songs in the Book of Isaiah, were later interpreted as such.

According to Werblowsky, the brutal regime of the Hellenistic Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes (r. 175–163 BCE) led to renewed messianic expectations reflected in the Book of Daniel. His rule was ended by the Maccabean Revolt (167–160 BCE), and the installment of the Hasmonean dynasty (167–37 BCE). The Maccabees ruled Judea semi-independently from the Seleucid Empire from 167–110 BCE, entirely independently from 110–63 BCE, and as a Roman client state from 63–37 BCE, when Herod the Great came to power. The belief in a messianic leader further developed with the end of the Hasmonean dynasty. According to James C. VanderKam, the apocalyptic genre shows a negative attitude towards the foreign powers which ruled Judea. Rejection of these powers was not the only cause of the development of the apocalyptic genre.

VanderKam states, &quot;the vast majority of Second Temple texts have no reference to a messianic leader of the endtime.&quot; The Animal Apocalypse of Enoch 1:85-90 (c. 160 BCE) is the first to do so. After that time, only some apocalypses and some texts which are not apocalypses but do contain apocalyptic or eschatological teachings refer to a messianic leader. According to VanderKam, the lack of messianic allusions may be explained by the fact that Judea was governed for centuries by foreign powers, often without great problems or a negative stance by Jews toward these gentile powers.

In the first century BCE, in the Qumran texts, the &quot;Psalms of Solomon&quot;, and the Similitudes of Enoch, &quot;both foreign and native rulers are castigated and hopes are placed on a Messiah (or Messiahs) who will end the present evil age of injustice. After the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70 CE), texts like 2 Baruch and 4 Ezra reflect the despair of the time. The images and status of the messiah in the various texts are quite different, but the apocalyptic messiahs are only somewhat more exalted than the leaders portrayed in the non-apocalyptic texts.

Charleswoth notes that messianic concepts are found in the Old Testament pseudepigrapha, which include a large number of Apocalypses.

=====Book of Daniel=====

The Book of Daniel (mid-2nd c. BCE) was quoted and referenced by both Jews and Christians in the 1st century CE as predicting the imminent end-time. The concepts of immortality and resurrection, with rewards for the righteous and punishment for the wicked, have roots much deeper than Daniel, but the first clear statement is found in the final chapter of that book: &quot;Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt.&quot; Without this belief, Christianity, in which the resurrection of Jesus plays a central role, may have disappeared, like the movements following other charismatic Jewish figures of the 1st century.

=====1 Enoch=====

The &quot;Book of Enoch&quot; (1 Enoch, 3rd-1st c. BCE) is a Second Temple Jewish apocalyptic religious work, ascribed by tradition to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. Enoch contains a prophetic exposition of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah. The older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) of the text are estimated to date from about 300 BCE, while the latest part (Book of Parables) probably to the 1st century BCE.

Enoch is the first text to contain the idea of a preexistent heavenly Messiah, called the &quot;Son of Man&quot;. 1 Enoch, and also 4 Ezra, transform the expectation of a kingly Messiah of Daniel 7 into &quot;an exalted, heavenly messiah whose role would be to execute judgment and to inaugurate a new age of peace and rejoicing.&quot; He is described as an angelic being, who &quot;was chosen and hidden with God before the world was created, and will remain in His presence forevermore.&quot; He is the embodiment of justice and wisdom, seated on a throne in Heaven, who will be revealed to the world at the end of times, when he will judge all beings.

Some scholars contend that Enoch was influential in molding New Testament doctrines about the Christ, the son of man, the messianic kingdom, Christian demonology, the universal resurrection, and Christian eschatology.

=====Messianic titles of the Dead Sea Scrolls=====
VanderKam further notes that a variety of titles are being used for the Messiah(s) in the Dead Sea Scrolls:
* Messiah - the Damascus Document, the Rule of the Congregation, the Commentary on Genesis, 4Q521 (Messianic Apocalypse), possibly 4Q246 (&quot;Son of God Text&quot;)
* Righteous One
* Chosen One
* Son of Man
* Son (of God)
* God&#x27;s Servant
* Prince of the Congregation 
* Branch of David
* Interpreter of the Law
* (High) Priest

=====Messianic allusions=====

Messianic allusions to some figures include to Menahem ben Hezekiah who traditionally was born on the same day that the Second Temple was destroyed.

====Jesus====
=====Jewish Christianity=====

Christianity started as a messianic Jewish sect. Most of Jesus&#x27;s teachings were intelligible and acceptable in terms of Second Temple Judaism; what set the followers of Jesus apart from other Jews was their faith in Jesus as the resurrected messiah. While ancient Judaism acknowledged multiple messiahs, the two most relevant being ben Joseph and ben David, Christianity acknowledges only one ultimate Messiah. According to Larry Hurtado, &quot;the christology and devotional stance that Paul affirmed (and shared with others in the early Jesus-movement) was not a departure from or a transcending of a supposedly monochrome Jewish messianism, but, instead, a distinctive expression within a variegated body of Jewish messianic hopes.&quot;

=====Rejection of Jesus as the Messiah=====
According to Maimonides, Jesus was the most influential, and consequently the most damaging, of all false messiahs. However, since the traditional Jewish belief is that the messiah has not yet come and the Messianic Age is not yet present, the total rejection of Jesus as either messiah or deity has never been a central issue for Judaism.

Judaism has never accepted any of the claimed fulfillments of prophecy that Christianity attributes to Jesus. Judaism forbids the worship of a person as a form of idolatry, since the central belief of Judaism is the absolute unity and singularity of God. Jewish eschatology holds that the coming of the Messiah will be associated with a specific series of events that have not yet occurred, including the return of Jews to their homeland and the rebuilding of the Temple, a Messianic Age of peace and understanding during which &quot;the knowledge of God&quot; fills the earth.&quot; And since Jews believe that none of these events occurred during the lifetime of Jesus (nor have they occurred afterwards), he is not the Messiah for them.

Traditional views of Jesus have been mostly negative (see &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot;, an account that portrays Jesus as an impostor), although in the Middle Ages, Judah Halevi and Maimonides viewed Jesus as an important preparatory figure for a future universal ethical monotheism of the Messianic Age. Some modern Jewish thinkers, starting in the 18th century with the Orthodox Jacob Emden and the reformer Moses Mendelssohn, have sympathetically argued that the historical Jesus may have been closer to Judaism than either the Gospels or traditional Jewish accounts would indicate.

==Post-Temple and medieval views==

===Talmud===
The Talmud extensively discusses the coming of the Messiah (Sanhedrin 98a–99a, et al.) and describes a period of freedom and peace, which will be the time of ultimate goodness for the Jews. Tractate Sanhedrin contains a long discussion of the events leading to the coming of the Messiah. The Talmud tells many stories about the Messiah, some of which represent famous Talmudic rabbis as receiving personal visitations from Elijah the Prophet and the Messiah.

===Midrash===
There are innumerable references to the Messiah in Midrashic literature, where they often stretch the meaning of biblical verses. One such reference is found in the Midrash HaGadol (on Genesis 36:39) where Abba bar Kahana says: &quot;What is meant by, &#x27;In that day the root of Jesse, who shall stand as an ensign for the peoples, of him shall the nations inquire, and his rest shall be glorious&#x27; ? It means that when the banner of the anointed king shall be lifted-up, all the masts of ships belonging to the nations of the world shall be broken, while all the lines (halyard, downhaul and sheets) are cut loose, while all ships are broken asunder, and none of them remain excepting the banner of the son of David, as it says: &#x27;who shall stand as an ensign for the peoples&#x27;. Likewise, when the banner of the son of David shall arise, all the languages belonging to the nations shall be made useless, and their customs shall be rendered null and void. The nations, at that time, will learn from the Messiah, as it says: &#x27;of him shall the nations inquire&#x27; (ibid.); &#x27;and his rest shall be glorious&#x27;, meaning, he gives to them satisfaction, and tranquility, and they dwell in peace and quiet.&quot;

===Maimonides===
The influential Jewish philosopher Maimonides discussed the messiah in his Mishneh Torah, his 14-volume compendium of Jewish law, in the section &quot;Hilkhot Melakhim Umilchamoteihem&quot;, chapters 11 &amp; 12. According to Maimonides, Jesus of Nazareth is not the Messiah, as is claimed by Christians.

Maimonides, citing a reference in the Talmud (&quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 91b), says: &quot;There is no difference between this world and the days of the Messiah, excepting only the subjugation of kingdoms.&quot;

=== Spanish Inquisition ===
Following the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, many Spanish rabbis such as Abraham ben Eliezer Halevi believed that the year 1524 would be the beginning of the Messianic Age and that the Messiah himself would appear in 1530–1531.

==Contemporary Jewish views ==

===Orthodox Judaism===
Orthodox Judaism maintains the 13 Principles of Faith as formulated by Maimonides in his introduction to Chapter &quot;Helek&quot; of the Mishna Torah. Each principle starts with the words &quot;Ani Maamin&quot; (I believe). Number 12 is the main principle relating to &quot;Mashiach&quot;. 
Orthodox Jews strictly believe in a Messiah, life after death, and restoration of the Promised Land:
====Hasidic Judaism====
Hasidic Jews tend to have a particularly strong and passionate belief in the immediacy of the Messiah&#x27;s coming, and in the ability of their actions to hasten his arrival. Because of the supposed piety, wisdom, and leadership abilities of the Hasidic Masters, members of Hasidic communities are sometimes inclined to regard their dynastic rebbes as potential candidates for Messiah. Many Jews (see the &quot;Bartenura&#x27;s&quot; explanation on &quot;Megillat Rut&quot;, and the &quot;Halakhic&quot; responsa of The &quot;Ch&#x27;sam Sofer&quot; on &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot; [vol. 6], Chapter 98 where this view is explicit), especially Hasidim, adhere to the belief that there is a person born each generation with the potential to become Messiah, if the Jewish people warrant his coming; this candidate is known as the &quot;Tzadik Ha-Dor&quot;, meaning &quot;Tzaddik of the Generation&quot;. However, fewer are likely to name a candidate.

====Chabad messianism====

Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the last Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch, declared often that the Messiah is very close, urging all to pray for the coming of the Messiah and to do everything possible to hasten the coming of the Messiah through increased acts of kindness. Starting in the late 1960s, the Rebbe called for his followers to become involved in outreach activities with the purpose of bringing about the Jewish Messianic Age, which led to controversy surrounding the messianic beliefs of Chabad. Some Chabad Hasidim, called &quot;mashichists&quot;, &quot;have not yet accepted the Rebbe&#x27;s passing&quot; and even after his death regard him as the (living) &#x27;King Messiah&#x27; and &#x27;Moses of the generation&#x27;, awaiting his second coming.

The &quot;Chabad-Messianic question&quot;, regarding a dead Messiah, got oppositional addresses from a halachic perspective by many prominent Orthodox authorities, including leaders from the Ashkenazi non-Hasidic Lithuanian (&quot;Litvak&quot;) institutions, Ponevezh yeshiva in Bnei Brak, Israel, and got vehement opposition, notably that of the Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim (RSA) in New York and that of the Rabbinical Council of America.

===Conservative Judaism===
&quot;Emet Ve-Emunah&quot;, the Conservative movement&#x27;s statement of principles, states the following:
===Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===
Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism generally do not accept the idea that there will be a Messiah. Some believe that there may be some sort of Messianic Age (the World to Come) in the sense of a utopia, which all Jews are obligated to work towards (thus the tradition of &quot;Tikkun olam&quot;). In 1999, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the official body of American Reform rabbis, authored &quot;A Statement of Principles for Reform Judaism&quot;, meant to describe and define the spiritual state of modern Reform Judaism.

===Karaite Judaism===
Karaite Judaism holds to Elijah Bashyazi and Caleb Afendopolo&#x27;s 10 principles of Karaite belief, with the tenth one being about the Messiah:

==Calculation of appearance==
According to the Talmud, the Midrash, and the Zohar, the &quot;deadline&quot; by which the Messiah must appear is 6000 years from creation (approximately the year 2024 or 2240 in the Gregorian calendar, though calculations vary). Elaborating on this theme are early and late Jewish scholars, including Nahmanides, Isaac Abarbanel, Abraham ibn Ezra, Bahya ibn Paquda, the Vilna Gaon, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, Aryeh Kaplan, and Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis.

<doc id="188590" wikidata="Q320967" url="?curid=188590" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi">
<text>was an aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Though she was laid down as an , &quot;Akagi&quot; was converted to an aircraft carrier while still under construction to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. The ship was rebuilt from 1935 to 1938 with her original three flight decks consolidated into a single enlarged flight deck and an island superstructure. The second Japanese aircraft carrier to enter service, and the first large or &quot;fleet&quot; carrier, &quot;Akagi&quot; and the related figured prominently in the development of the IJN&#x27;s new carrier striking force doctrine that grouped carriers together, concentrating their air power. This doctrine enabled Japan to attain its strategic goals during the early stages of the Pacific War from December 1941 until mid-1942.

&quot;Akagi&quot;″s aircraft served in the Second Sino-Japanese War in the late 1930s. Upon the formation of the First Air Fleet or &quot;Kido Butai&quot; (Striking Force) in early 1941, she became its flagship, and remained so for the duration of her service. With other fleet carriers, she took part in the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month, her aircraft bombed Darwin, Australia, and assisted in the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. In March and April 1942, &quot;Akagi&quot; aircraft helped sink a British heavy cruiser and an Australian destroyer in the Indian Ocean Raid.

After a brief refit, &quot;Akagi&quot; and three other fleet carriers of the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on the atoll, &quot;Akagi&quot; and the other carriers were attacked by aircraft from Midway and the carriers , , and . A single dive bomber from &quot;Enterprise&quot; severely damaged &quot;Akagi&quot;. When it became obvious she could not be saved, she was scuttled by Japanese destroyers to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. The loss of &quot;Akagi&quot; and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to the Allies&#x27; ultimate victory in the Pacific. Her wreck was located in 2019 by the Research Vessel &quot;Petrel&quot;.

==Design==
===Construction and launch===

&quot;Akagi&quot; was laid down as an at Kure, Japan, on 6 December 1920. Construction was halted, however, when Japan signed the Washington Naval Treaty on 6 February 1922. The treaty placed restrictions on the construction of battleships and battlecruisers although it authorized the conversion of two battleship or battlecruiser hulls under construction into aircraft carriers of up to displacement. The IJN had decided, following the launch of its first aircraft carrier, , to construct two larger, faster carriers for operations with major fleet units. The incomplete hulls of and &quot;Akagi&quot; were thus selected for completion as the two large carriers under the 1924 fleet construction program. ¥24.7 million was originally budgeted to complete &quot;Akagi&quot; as a battlecruiser and an estimated ¥8 million had been expended when construction stopped in February 1922. Shortly thereafter, the Diet approved an additional ¥90 million to complete &quot;Akagi&quot; and &quot;Amagi&quot; as carriers. Her guns were turned over to the Imperial Japanese Army for use as coastal artillery; one of her main-gun turrets was installed on Iki Island in the Strait of Tsushima in 1932. The rest of her guns were placed in reserve and scrapped in 1943.
Construction of &quot;Akagi&quot; as an aircraft carrier began on 19 November 1923. &quot;Amagi&quot;″s hull was damaged beyond economically feasible repair in the Great Kantō earthquake of 1 September 1923 and was broken up and scrapped. &quot;Akagi&quot;, the only remaining member of her class, was launched as a carrier on 22 April 1925 and commissioned at Kure Naval Arsenal on 25 March 1927, although trials continued through November 1927. She was the second carrier to enter service with the IJN, after &quot;Hōshō&quot; and before (which replaced &quot;Amagi&quot;).

Since &quot;Akagi&quot; was initially conceived as a battlecruiser, the prevailing ship naming conventions dictated that she (like her sister ships) be named after a mountain. &quot;Akagi&quot; came from Mount Akagi, a dormant volcano in the Kantō region (the name literally means &quot;red castle&quot;). After she was redesignated as an aircraft carrier, her mountain name remained, in contrast to ships like that were originally built as aircraft carriers, which were named after flying creatures. Her name was previously given to the &quot;Maya&quot;-class gunboat &quot;Akagi&quot;.

&quot;Akagi&quot; was completed at a length of overall. She had a beam of and, at deep load, a draft of . She displaced at (standard) load, and at full load, nearly less than her designed displacement as a battlecruiser. Her complement totaled 1,600 crewmembers.

===Flight deck arrangements===
&quot;Akagi&quot; and &quot;Kaga&quot; were completed with three superimposed flight decks, the only carriers ever to be designed so. The British carriers converted from &quot;large light cruisers&quot;, , , and , each had two flight decks, but there is no evidence that the Japanese copied the British model. It is more likely that it was a case of convergent evolution to improve launch and recovery cycle flexibility by allowing simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft. &quot;Akagi&quot;″s main flight deck was long and wide, her middle flight deck (beginning right in front of the bridge) was only long and her lower flight deck was long. The utility of her middle flight deck was questionable as it was so short that only some lightly loaded aircraft could use it, even in an era when the aircraft were much lighter and smaller than during World War II. The upper flight deck sloped slightly from amidships toward the bow and toward the stern to assist landings and takeoffs for the underpowered aircraft of that time.
As completed, the ship had two main hangar decks and a third auxiliary hangar, giving a total capacity of 60 aircraft. The third and lowest hangar deck was used only for storing disassembled aircraft. The two main hangars opened onto the middle and lower flight decks to allow aircraft to take off directly from the hangars while landing operations were in progress on the main flight deck above. The upper and middle hangar areas totaled about , the lower hangar about . No catapults were fitted. Her forward aircraft lift was offset to starboard and in size. Her aft lift was on the centerline and . The aft elevator serviced the upper flight deck and all three hangar decks. Her arresting gear was an unsatisfactory British longitudinal system used on the carrier &quot;Furious&quot; that relied on friction between the arrester hook and the cables. The Japanese were well aware of this system&#x27;s flaws, as it was already in use on their first carrier, &quot;Hōshō&quot;, but had no alternatives available when &quot;Akagi&quot; was completed. It was replaced during the ship&#x27;s refit in 1931 with a Japanese-designed transverse cable system with six wires and that was replaced in turn before &quot;Akagi&quot; began her modernization in 1935 by the Kure Model 4 type (Kure shiki 4 gata). There was no island superstructure when the carrier was completed; the carrier was commanded from a space below the forward end of the upper flight deck. The ship carried approximately of aviation fuel for her embarked aircraft.

As originally completed, &quot;Akagi&quot; carried an air group of 28 Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers, 16 Nakajima A1N fighters and 16 Mitsubishi 2MR reconnaissance aircraft.

===Armament and armor===

&quot;Akagi&quot; was armed with ten 50-caliber 20 cm 3rd Year Type No. 1 guns, six in casemates aft and the rest in two twin-gun turrets, one on each side of the middle flight deck. They fired projectiles at a rate of 3–6 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of at 25°, this provided a maximum range between . The turrets were nominally capable of 70° elevation to provide additional anti-aircraft fire, but in practice the maximum elevation was only 55°. The slow rate of fire and the fixed 5° loading angle minimized any real anti-aircraft capability. This heavy gun armament was provided in case she was surprised by enemy cruisers and forced to give battle, but her large and vulnerable flight deck, hangars, and superstructure made her more of a target in any surface action than a fighting warship. Carrier doctrine was still evolving at this time and the impracticality of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized.

The ship carried dedicated anti-aircraft armament of six twin 45-caliber 12 cm 10th Year Type gun mounts fitted on sponsons below the level of the funnels, where they could not fire across the flight deck, three mounts per side. These guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 45°, this provided a maximum range of , and they had a maximum ceiling of at 75° elevation. Their effective rate of fire was 6–8 rounds per minute.

&quot;Akagi&quot;″s waterline armored belt was reduced from and placed lower on the ship than originally designed. The upper part of her torpedo bulge was given of armor. Her deck armor was also reduced from . The modifications improved the ship&#x27;s stability by helping compensate for the increased topside weight of the double hangar deck.

===Propulsion===
In &quot;Akagi&quot; predecessor, &quot;Hōshō&quot;, the hot exhaust gases vented by swivelling funnels posed a danger to the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. &quot;Akagi&quot; and &quot;Kaga&quot; were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. &quot;Akagi&quot; was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. &quot;Kaga&quot; adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.

&quot;Akagi&quot; was completed with four Gihon geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, that produced a total of . Steam for these turbines was provided by nineteen Type B Kampon boilers with a working pressure of . Some boilers were oil-fired, and the others used a mix of fuel oil and coal. As a battlecruiser, she was expected to achieve , but the reduction in displacement from increased her maximum speed to , which was reached during her sea trials on 17 June 1927. She carried of fuel oil and of coal that gave her a range of at .

==Early service==
&quot;Akagi&quot; joined the Combined Fleet in August 1927 and was assigned to the First Carrier Division upon its formation on 1 April 1928, serving as the division&#x27;s flagship under Rear Admiral Sankichi Takahashi. The carrier&#x27;s early career was uneventful, consisting of various training exercises. From 10 December 1928 to 1 November 1929, the ship was captained by Isoroku Yamamoto, future commander of the Combined Fleet.

&quot;Akagi&quot; was reduced to second-class reserve status on 1 December 1931 in preparation for a short refit in which her arresting gear was replaced and her radio and ventilation systems were overhauled and improved. After completion of the refit, &quot;Akagi&quot; became a first-class reserve ship in December 1932. On 25 April 1933, she resumed active service and joined the Second Carrier Division and participated in that year&#x27;s Special Fleet Maneuvers.

At this time, the IJN&#x27;s carrier doctrine was still in its early stages. &quot;Akagi&quot; and the IJN&#x27;s other carriers were initially given roles as tactical force multipliers supporting the fleet&#x27;s battleships in the IJN&#x27;s &quot;decisive battle&quot; doctrine. In this role, &quot;Akagi&quot;″s aircraft were to attack enemy battleships with bombs and torpedoes. Aerial strikes against enemy carriers were later (beginning around 1932–1933) deemed of equal importance, with the goal of establishing air superiority during the initial stages of battle. The essential component in this strategy was that the Japanese carrier aircraft must be able to strike first with a massed, preemptive aerial attack. In fleet training exercises, the carriers began to operate together in front of or with the main battle line. The new strategy emphasized maximum speed from both the carriers and the aircraft they carried as well as larger aircraft with greater range. Thus, longer flight decks on the carriers were required in order to handle the newer, heavier aircraft which were entering service. As a result, on 15 November 1935 &quot;Akagi&quot; was placed in third-class reserve to begin an extensive modernization at Sasebo Naval Arsenal.

==Reconstruction==
&quot;Akagi&quot;″s modernization involved far less work than that of &quot;Kaga&quot;, but took three times as long due to financial difficulties related to the Great Depression. The ship&#x27;s three flight decks were judged too small to handle the larger and heavier aircraft then coming into service. As a result, the middle and lower flight decks were eliminated in favor of two enclosed hangar decks that extended almost the full length of the ship. The upper and middle hangar areas&#x27; total space increased to about ; the lower hangar remained the same size. The upper flight deck was extended to the bow, increasing its length to and raising aircraft capacity to 86 (61 operational and 25 in storage). A third elevator midships, in size, was added. Her arrester gear was replaced by a Japanese-designed, hydraulic Type 1 system with 9 wires. The modernization added an island superstructure on the port side of the ship, which was an unusual arrangement; the only other carrier to share this feature was a contemporary, the . The port side was chosen as an experiment to see if that side was better for flight operations by moving the island away from the ship&#x27;s exhaust outlets. The new flight deck inclined slightly fore and aft from a point about three-eighths of the way aft.
&quot;Akagi&quot;″s speed was already satisfactory and the only changes to her machinery were the replacement of the mixed coal/oil-fired boilers with modern oil-fired units and the improvement of the ventilation arrangements. Although the engine horsepower increased from 131,200 to 133,000, her speed declined slightly from on trials because of the increase in her displacement to . Her bunkerage was increased to of fuel oil which increased her endurance to at . The rear vertical funnel was changed to match the forward funnel and incorporated into the same casing.

The two 20 cm gun turrets on the middle flight deck were removed and 14 twin Type 96 gun mounts were added on sponsons. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 50°, this provided a maximum range of , and an effective ceiling of . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the 15-round magazines. Six Type 95 directors were fitted to control the new 25 mm guns and two new Type 94 anti-aircraft directors replaced the outdated Type 91s. After the modernization, &quot;Akagi&quot; carried one Type 89 director for the guns; it is uncertain how many were carried before then. The ship&#x27;s crew increased to 2,000 after the reconstruction.
The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns were grouped amidships and placed relatively low on the hull. Thus, the guns could not be brought to bear directly forward or aft. Also, the island blocked the forward arcs of the port battery. As a result, the ship was vulnerable to attack by dive bombers. The ship&#x27;s 12 cm 10th Year Type guns were scheduled to be replaced by more modern Type 89 mounts in 1942. The anti-aircraft sponsons were to be raised one deck to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire as was done during &quot;Kaga&quot;″s modernization. However, the ship was lost in combat before the upgrade could take place.

Several major weaknesses in &quot;Akagi&quot;″s design were not rectified. &quot;Akagi&quot;″s aviation fuel tanks were incorporated directly into the structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier&#x27;s hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ship&#x27;s fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.

==Lead-up to World War II==
&quot;Akagi&quot;″s modernization was completed on 31 August 1938. She was reclassified as a first reserve ship on 15 November, but did not rejoin the First Carrier Division until the following month. In her new configuration, the carrier embarked 12 Mitsubishi A5M Type 96 &quot;Claude&quot; fighters with four disassembled spares, 19 Aichi D1A &quot;Susie&quot; dive bombers with five spares, and 35 Yokosuka B4Y &quot;Jean&quot; horizontal/torpedo bombers with 16 spares. She sailed for southern Chinese waters on 30 January 1939 and supported ground operations there, including attacks on Guilin and Liuzhou, until 19 February, when she returned to Japan. &quot;Akagi&quot; supported operations in central China between 27 March and 2 April 1940. She was reclassified as a special purpose ship (&quot;Tokubetse Ilomokan&quot;) on 15 November 1940, while she was being overhauled.
The Japanese experiences off China had helped further develop the IJN&#x27;s carrier doctrine. One lesson learned in China was the importance of concentration and mass in projecting naval air power ashore. Therefore, in April 1941, the IJN formed the First Air Fleet, or &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, to combine all of its fleet carriers under a single command. On 10 April, &quot;Akagi&quot; and &quot;Kaga&quot; were assigned to the First Carrier Division as part of the new carrier fleet, which also included the Second (with carriers &quot;Hiryū&quot; and &quot;Sōryū&quot;), and Fifth (with &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;) carrier divisions. The IJN centered its doctrine on air strikes that combined the air groups of entire carrier divisions, rather than individual carriers. When multiple carrier divisions were operating together, the divisions&#x27; air groups were combined. This doctrine of combined, massed, carrier-based air attack groups was the most advanced of its kind in the world. The IJN, however, remained concerned that concentrating all of its carriers together would render them vulnerable to being wiped out all at once by a massive enemy air or surface strike. Thus, the IJN developed a compromise solution in which the fleet carriers would operate closely together within their carrier divisions but the divisions themselves would operate in loose rectangular formations, with approximately separating each carrier.

The Japanese doctrine held that entire carrier air groups should not be launched in a single massed attack. Instead, each carrier would launch a &quot;deckload strike&quot; of all its aircraft that could be spotted at one time on each flight deck. Subsequent attack waves consisted of the next deckload of aircraft. Thus, First Air Fleet air attacks would often consist of at least two massed waves of aircraft. The First Air Fleet was &quot;not&quot; considered to be the IJN&#x27;s primary strategic striking force. The IJN still considered the First Air Fleet an integral component in the Combined Fleet&#x27;s &quot;Kantai Kessen&quot; or &quot;decisive battle&quot; task force centered on battleships. &quot;Akagi&quot; was designated as the flagship for the First Air Fleet, a role the ship retained until her sinking 14 months later.

Although the concentration of so many fleet carriers into a single unit was a new and revolutionary offensive strategic concept, the First Air Fleet suffered from several defensive deficiencies that gave it, in Mark Peattie&#x27;s words, a &#x27;: it could throw a punch but couldn&#x27;t take one.&quot; Japanese carrier anti-aircraft guns and associated fire-control systems had several design and configuration deficiencies that limited their effectiveness. Also, the IJN&#x27;s fleet combat air patrol (CAP) consisted of too few fighter aircraft and was hampered by an inadequate early warning system, including lack of radar. In addition, poor radio communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control of the CAP. Furthermore, the carriers&#x27; escorting warships were not trained or deployed to provide close anti-aircraft support. These deficiencies, combined with the shipboard weaknesses previously detailed, would eventually doom &quot;Akagi&quot; and other First Air Fleet carriers.

==World War II==
===Pearl Harbor and subsequent operations===

In preparation for the attack, the ship was anchored at Ariake Bay, Kyushu beginning in September 1941 while her aircraft were based at Kagoshima to train with the other 1st Air Fleet air units for the Pearl Harbor operation. Once preparations and training were completed, &quot;Akagi&quot; assembled with the rest of the First Air Fleet at Hitokappu Bay in the Kuril Islands on 22 November 1941. The ships departed on 26 November 1941 for Hawaii.
Commanded by Captain Kiichi Hasegawa, &quot;Akagi&quot; was Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo&#x27;s flagship for the striking force for the attack on Pearl Harbor that attempted to cripple the United States Pacific Fleet. &quot;Akagi&quot; and the other five carriers, from a position north of Oahu, launched two waves of aircraft on the morning of 7 December 1941. In the first wave, 27 Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers from &quot;Akagi&quot; torpedoed the battleships , , and while 9 of the ship&#x27;s Mitsubishi A6M Zeros attacked the air base at Hickam Field. In the second wave, 18 Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers from the carrier targeted the battleships and , the light cruiser , the destroyer , and the fleet oiler while nine &quot;Zeros&quot; attacked various American airfields. One of the carrier&#x27;s Zeros was shot down by American anti-aircraft guns during the first wave attack, killing its pilot. In addition to the aircraft which participated in the raid, three of the carrier&#x27;s fighters were assigned to the CAP. One of the carrier&#x27;s Zero fighters attacked a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber that had just arrived from the mainland, setting it on fire as it landed at Hickam, killing one of its crew.

In January 1942, together with the rest of the First and Fifth Carrier Divisions, &quot;Akagi&quot; supported the invasion of Rabaul in the Bismarck Archipelago, as the Japanese moved to secure their southern defensive perimeter against attacks from Australia. She provided 20 B5Ns and 9 Zeros for the initial airstrike on Rabaul on 20 January 1942. The First Carrier Division attacked Allied positions at nearby Kavieng the following day, of which &quot;Akagi&quot; contributed 9 A6M Zeros and 18 D3As. On the 22nd, &quot;Akagi&quot;″s D3As and Zeros again attacked Rabaul before returning to Truk on 27 January. The Second Carrier Division, with &quot;Sōryū&quot; and &quot;Hiryū&quot;, had been detached to support the invasion of Wake Island on 23 December 1941 and did not reunite with the rest of the carrier mobile striking force until February 1942.

&quot;Akagi&quot;, along with &quot;Kaga&quot; and the carrier , sortied in search of American naval forces raiding the Marshall Islands on 1 February 1942, before being recalled. On 7 February &quot;Akagi&quot; and the carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions were ordered south to the Timor Sea where, on 19 February, from a point southeast of the easternmost tip of Timor, they launched air strikes against Darwin, Australia, in an attempt to destroy its port and airfield facilities to prevent any interference with the invasion of Java. &quot;Akagi&quot; contributed 18 B5Ns, 18 D3As, and 9 Zeros to the attack, which caught the defenders by surprise. Eight ships were sunk, including the American destroyer , and fourteen more were damaged. None of the carrier&#x27;s aircraft were lost in the attack and the attack was effective in preventing Darwin from contributing to the Allied defense of Java. On 1 March, the American oiler was sunk by D3As from &quot;Sōryū&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot;. Later that same day the American destroyer was attacked and sunk by D3As from &quot;Akagi&quot; and &quot;Sōryū&quot;, in combination with gunfire from two battleships and two heavy cruisers of the escort force. &quot;Akagi&quot; and her consorts covered the invasion of Java, although her main contribution appears to have been providing 18 B5Ns and 9 Zeros for the 5 March air strike on Tjilatjap. This group was very successful, sinking eight ships in the harbor there and none of &quot;Akagi&quot;″s aircraft were lost. Most of the Allied forces in the Dutch East Indies surrendered to the Japanese later in March. The &quot;Kido Butai&quot; then sailed for Staring Bay on Celebes Island to refuel and recuperate.

===Indian Ocean raid===
On 26 March, &quot;Akagi&quot; set sail for the Indian Ocean raid with the rest of the &quot;Kido Butai&quot;. The Japanese intent was to defeat the British Eastern Fleet and destroy British airpower in the region in order to secure the flank of their operations in Burma. On 5 April 1942, &quot;Akagi&quot; launched 17 B5Ns and 9 Zeros in an air strike against Colombo, Ceylon, which damaged the port facilities. None of the aircraft were lost and the Zero pilots claimed to have shot down a dozen of the defending British fighters. Later that day, 17 D3As from &quot;Akagi&quot; helped to sink the British heavy cruisers and . On 9 April, she attacked Trincomalee with 18 B5Ns, escorted by 6 Zeros which claimed to have shot down 5 Hawker Hurricane fighters (only two of which can be confirmed from Allied records) without loss to themselves. Meanwhile, a floatplane from the battleship spotted the small aircraft carrier , escorted by the Australian destroyer , and every available D3A was launched to attack the ships. &quot;Akagi&quot; contributed 17 dive bombers and they helped to sink both ships; they also spotted the oil tanker RFA &quot;Athelstone&quot;, escorted by the corvette , and sank both without loss. During the day&#x27;s actions, the carrier narrowly escaped damage when nine British Bristol Blenheim bombers from Ceylon penetrated the CAP and dropped their bombs from , just missing the carrier and the heavy cruiser . Four of the Blenheims were subsequently shot down by CAP fighters and one was shot down by aircraft from the carriers&#x27; returning air strike. After the raid, the carrier mobile striking force returned to Japan to refit and replenish.

On 19 April 1942, while near Taiwan during the transit to Japan, &quot;Akagi&quot;, &quot;Sōryū&quot;, and &quot;Hiryū&quot; were sent in pursuit of the American carriers and , which had launched the Doolittle Raid. They found only empty ocean, however, for the American carriers had immediately departed the area to return to Hawaii. &quot;Akagi&quot; and the other carriers shortly abandoned the chase and dropped anchor at Hashirajima anchorage on 22 April. On 25 April, Captain Taijiro Aoki relieved Hasegawa as skipper of the carrier. Having been engaged in constant operations for four and a half months, the ship, along with the other three carriers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions, was hurriedly refitted and replenished in preparation for the Combined Fleet&#x27;s next major operation, scheduled to begin one month hence. The Fifth Carrier Division, with &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, had been detached in mid-April to support Operation Mo, resulting in the Battle of the Coral Sea. While at Hashirajima, &quot;Akagi&quot;″s air group was based ashore in Kagoshima and conducted flight and weapons training with the other First Air Fleet carrier units.

===Midway===

Concerned by the US carrier strikes in the Marshall Islands, Lae-Salamaua, and the Doolittle raids, Yamamoto determined to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. He decided to invade and occupy Midway Island, which he was sure would draw out the American carrier forces to battle. The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation &quot;MI&quot;.

On 25 May 1942, &quot;Akagi&quot; set out with the Combined Fleet&#x27;s carrier striking force in the company of carriers &quot;Kaga&quot;, &quot;Hiryū&quot;, and S&quot;ōryū&quot;, which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on Midway Island. Once again, Nagumo flew his flag on &quot;Akagi&quot;. Because of damage and losses suffered during the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Fifth Carrier Division with carriers &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; were absent from the operation. &quot;Akagi&quot;″s aircraft complement consisted of 24 Zeros, 18 D3As, and 18 B5Ns.

With the fleet positioned northwest of Midway Island at dawn (04:45 local time) on 4 June 1942, &quot;Akagi&quot;″s portion of the 108-plane combined air raid was a strike on the airfield on Eastern Island with 18 dive bombers escorted by nine Zeros. The carrier&#x27;s B5Ns were armed with torpedoes and kept ready in case enemy ships were discovered during the Midway operation. The only loss during the raid from &quot;Akagi&quot;″s air group was one Zero shot down by AA fire and three damaged; four dive bombers were damaged, of which one could not be repaired. Unbeknownst to the Japanese, the US Navy had discovered the Japanese &quot;MI&quot; plan by breaking the Japanese cipher and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.

One of &quot;Akagi&quot;″s torpedo bombers was launched to augment the search for any American ships that might be in the area. The carrier contributed three Zeros to the total of 11 assigned to the initial combat air patrol over the four carriers. By 07:00, the carrier had 11 fighters with the CAP which helped to defend the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; from the first US attackers from Midway Island at 07:10.

At this time, Nagumo&#x27;s carriers were attacked by six US Navy Grumman TBF Avengers from Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) and four United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-26 Marauders, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after &quot;Hiryū&quot; while the Marauders attacked &quot;Akagi&quot;. The 30 CAP Zeroes in the air at this time, including the 11 from &quot;Akagi&quot;, immediately attacked the American aircraft, shooting down five of the Avengers and two of the B-26s. One of &quot;Akagi&quot;″s Zeroes, however, was shot down by defensive fire from the B-26s. Several of the Marauders dropped their torpedoes, but all either missed or failed to detonate. One B-26, piloted by Lieutenant James Muri, strafed &quot;Akagi&quot; after dropping its torpedo, killing two men. Another, seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire, did not pull out of its run, and instead flew directly at &quot;Akagi&quot;″s bridge. The aircraft, either attempting a suicide ramming, or out of control, narrowly missed striking the carrier&#x27;s bridge, which could have killed Nagumo and his staff, and crashed into the ocean. This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo&#x27;s determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto&#x27;s order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.

At 07:15, Nagumo ordered the B5Ns on &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot; rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was limited by the number of ordnance carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40, Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Three of &quot;Akagi&quot;″s CAP Zeroes landed aboard the carrier at 07:36. At 07:40, her lone scout returned, having sighted nothing.

====Sinking====

At 07:55, the next American strike from Midway arrived in the form of 16 Marine SBD-2 Dauntless dive bombers of VMSB-241 under Major Lofton R. Henderson. &quot;Akagi&quot;″s three remaining CAP fighters were among the nine still aloft that attacked Henderson&#x27;s planes, shooting down six of them as they executed a fruitless glide bombing attack on &quot;Hiryū&quot;. At roughly the same time, the Japanese carriers were attacked by 12 USAAF B-17 Flying Fortresses, bombing from . The high altitude of the bombers gave the Japanese captains enough time to anticipate where the bombs would land and successfully maneuver their ships out of the impact area. Four B-17s attacked &quot;Akagi&quot;, but missed with all their bombs.

&quot;Akagi&quot; reinforced the CAP with launches of three Zeros at 08:08 and four at 08:32. These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next American air strike from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicators from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship &quot;Haruna&quot; starting around 08:30. Three of the Vindicators were shot down, and &quot;Haruna&quot; escaped damage. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, they kept the Japanese carrier forces off-balance as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.

&quot;Akagi&quot; began recovering her Midway strike force at 08:37 and finished shortly after 09:00. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers&#x27; crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the strike against the American carrier forces. The preparations, however, were interrupted at 09:18 when the first American carrier aircraft to attack were sighted. These consisted of 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by John C. Waldron from the carrier &quot;Hornet&quot;. The six airborne &quot;Akagi&quot; CAP Zeroes joined the other 15 CAP fighters currently aloft in destroying Waldron&#x27;s planes. All 15 of the American planes were shot down as they attempted a torpedo attack on &quot;Soryū&quot;, leaving one surviving aviator treading water.

Shortly afterwards 14 Devastators from VT-6 from the carrier &quot;Enterprise&quot;, led by Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey&#x27;s aircraft tried to sandwich &quot;Kaga&quot;, but the CAP, reinforced by an additional eight Zeros launched by &quot;Akagi&quot; at 09:33 and 09:40, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and &quot;Kaga&quot; dodged the torpedoes. Defensive fire from the Devastators shot down one of &quot;Akagi&quot;″s Zeros.
Minutes after the torpedo plane attacks, American carrier-based dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. It was at this time, around 10:20, that in the words of Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, the &quot;Japanese air defenses would finally and catastrophically fail.&quot; Twenty-eight dive bombers from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, led by C. Wade McClusky, began an attack on &quot;Kaga&quot;, hitting her with at least four bombs. At the last minute, one of McClusky&#x27;s elements of three bombers from VB-6, led by squadron commander Richard Best who deduced &quot;Kaga&quot; to be fatally damaged, broke off and dove simultaneously on &quot;Akagi&quot;. At approximately 10:26, the three bombers hit her with one bomb and just missed with two others. The first near-miss landed to port, near her island. The third bomb just missed the flight deck and plunged into the water next to the stern. The second bomb, likely dropped by Best, landed at the aft edge of the middle elevator and detonated in the upper hangar. This hit set off explosions among the fully armed and fueled B5N torpedo bombers that were being prepared for an air strike against the American carriers, resulting in an uncontrollable fire.

At 10:29, Aoki ordered the ship&#x27;s magazines flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were not due to valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship&#x27;s main water pump also appears to have been damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship&#x27;s rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.

Shortly thereafter, the fires broke through the flight deck and heat and smoke made the ship&#x27;s bridge unusable. At 10:46, Nagumo transferred his flag to the light cruiser . &quot;Akagi&quot; stopped dead in the water at 13:50 and her crew, except for Aoki and damage-control personnel, was evacuated. She continued to burn as her crew fought a losing battle against the spreading fires. The damage-control teams and Aoki were evacuated from the still floating ship later that night.

At 04:50 on 5 June, Yamamoto ordered &quot;Akagi&quot; scuttled, saying to his staff, &quot;I was once the captain of &quot;Akagi&quot;, and it is with heartfelt regret that I must now order that she be sunk.&quot; Destroyers , , , and &quot;Nowaki&quot; each fired one torpedo into the carrier and she sank, bow first, at 05:20 at . Two hundred and sixty-seven men of the ship&#x27;s crew were lost, the fewest of any of the Japanese fleet carriers lost in the battle. The loss of &quot;Akagi&quot; and the three other IJN carriers at Midway, comprising two thirds of Japan&#x27;s total number of fleet carriers and the experienced core of the First Air Fleet, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan&#x27;s ultimate defeat in the war. In an effort to conceal the defeat, &quot;Akagi&quot; was not immediately removed from the Navy&#x27;s registry of ships, instead being listed as &quot;unmanned&quot; before finally being struck from the registry on 25 September 1942.

==Wreck survey==
On 20 October 2019, the Director of Undersea Operations for Vulcan Inc. Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson aboard identified the wreck of &quot;Akagi&quot; using high-frequency sonar. Located north west of Pearl Harbor, &quot;Akagi&quot; was found at a depth of . It is reported that the wreck is upright, on its keel and is largely intact. Two days before the discovery of &quot;Akagi&quot;, &quot;Petrel&quot; had discovered the wreck of &quot;Kaga&quot;.

The wreck of &quot;Akagi&quot; was visited and photographed by the research vessel in September 2023. The survey confirmed that the ship was largely intact despite large amounts of damage to the hull, superstructure and flight deck.

<doc id="188618" wikidata="Q1134612" url="?curid=188618" title="Hagley Park, Christchurch">
<text>Hagley Park is the largest urban open space (164.637 hectares) in Christchurch, New Zealand, and was established in 1855 by the Provincial Government. According to the government&#x27;s decree at that time, Hagley Park is &quot;reserved forever as a public park, and shall be open for the recreation and enjoyment of the public.&quot; Hagley Park is characterised by its trees and broad open spaces. Hagley Park was named after Hagley Park, the country estate of Lord Lyttelton, who became chairman of the Canterbury Association in March 1850.

==Location==
The boundaries of the park, which is located to the east of the central city of Christchurch, are defined by both the Avon River / Ōtākaro and the surrounding roadways. The longest road boundary is that along Deans Avenue, often regarded as one of The Four Avenues which delimit central Christchurch. On the western side adjacent is the suburb of Riccarton.

To the north and northeast, the natural path of the Avon River bounds the park. Moorhouse Avenue and Hagley Avenue form the south and south-eastern boundaries, respectively. Along the eastern boundary, the Park is defined by the two kilometre loop of the Avon River, which extends into the side of Hagley Park.

The Christchurch Botanic Gardens (21.14 hectares) are located within this loop and frequent bridges provide connections. The Botanic Gardens contain a collection of beautiful flowers and trees from around the world. The gardens attract many birds to the park, and sightseers frequently visit the park to view the plants and the wildlife.

The Canterbury Museum and Christ&#x27;s College are the two other land uses that take up the balance of the land within the river&#x27;s loop.

Two major avenues subdivide the park into three units. The northern unit is Little Hagley Park (6.96 hectares), with North Hagley Park (87.17 hectares) lying to the south of Harper Avenue. South Hagley Park (70.507 hectares) lies to the south of North Hagley Park, separated by Riccarton Avenue.

==Road proposals==
At various times, it was proposed to build additional roads through the park. In the 1860s, it was considered to connect Armagh Street with the Great South Road (now called Riccarton Road).

==Usage==

In its early days, Hagley Park was used for horse races. Hagley Park has frequently been a site for gathering large crowds together: it served as the location for the Great Industrial Exposition of 1882 and the New Zealand International Exhibition in 1906–1907. In 1906, the Australasian tennis championships (now known as the Australian Open) were held in Hagley Park as part of the Grand Slam. The singles event was won by Tony Wilding, who defeated Francis Fisher in three sets.

In recent years, the park has hosted many visiting circuses and open-air concerts. The Ellerslie Flower Show has been held in North Hagley Park since 2008. The park has hosted the Electric Avenue Music Festival.

There is also a golf course (named Hagley Golf Club) located in North Hagley Park.

South Hagley Park contains several netball courts, the Hagley Oval cricket ground and a heliport for Christchurch Hospital, although as of 2019 there are calls to build a helipad on the roof of the hospital itself.

Hagley Park was also the site of a national memorial service attended by 20,000 people to remember the 51 dead victims of the Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre which included the likes of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and British Muslim convert singer Yusuf Islam (aka Cat Stevens).

The weekly Saturday parkrun takes place at the North Hagley Park.

<doc id="188622" wikidata="Q1331574" url="?curid=188622" title="Tower 42">
<text>Tower 42, commonly known as the NatWest Tower, is a skyscraper in the City of London. It is the sixth-tallest tower in the City of London and the 19th-tallest in London overall. Its original name was the National Westminster Tower, having been built to house NatWest&#x27;s international headquarters. Seen from above, the shape of the tower resembles that of the NatWest logo (three chevrons in a hexagonal arrangement).

The tower, designed by Richard Seifert and engineered by Pell Frischmann, is located at 25 Old Broad Street in the ward of Cornhill. It was built by John Mowlem &amp; Co between 1971 and 1980, first occupied in 1980, and formally opened on 11 June 1981 by Queen Elizabeth II.

At high, it was the tallest building in the United Kingdom until superseded by One Canada Square at Canary Wharf in 1990. It was the tallest building built in London in the 1980s and remained the tallest in the City of London until overtaken by the Heron Tower in 2010.

The building today is multi-tenanted and comprises Grade A office space and restaurant facilities, with restaurants on the 24th and 42nd floors. In 2011, it was bought by the South African businessman Nathan Kirsh.

==History==
===Design and development===

The National Westminster Tower&#x27;s status as the first skyscraper in the city was a coup for NatWest, but was extremely controversial at the time, as it was a major departure from the previous restrictions on tall buildings in London. The original concept dates back to the early 1960s, predating the formation of the National Westminster Bank. The site was then the headquarters of the National Provincial Bank, with offices in Old Broad Street backing onto its flagship branch at 15 Bishopsgate.

Early designs envisaged a tower of ; this developed into a design with a tower as its centrepiece, proposed in 1964 by architect Richard Seifert. The plan attracted opposition, partly because of the unprecedented height of the design and partly because of the proposed demolition of the 19th-century bank building at 15 Bishopsgate, which dated from 1865 and was designed by architect John Gibson. Seifert, who had developed a reputation for overcoming planning objections, organised an exhibition in which he presented two alternative visions: his preferred design, and a second design featuring a tower with an &quot;absurdly squat&quot; second tower alongside. Visitors were invited to vote and overwhelmingly chose the single tower design. The final design preserved the Gibson banking hall and the tower&#x27;s height was reduced to .

===Construction===

Demolition of the site commenced in 1970 and the tower was completed in 1980. The building was constructed by John Mowlem &amp; Co around a huge concrete core from which the floors are cantilevered, giving it great strength but significantly limiting the amount of office space available.

In total, there are 47 levels above ground, of which 42 are cantilevered. The lowest cantilevered floor is designated Level 1, but is in fact the fourth level above ground. The cantilevered floors are designed as three segments, or leaves, which approximately correspond to the three chevrons of the NatWest logo when viewed in plan. The two lowest cantilevered levels (1 and 2) are formed of a single &quot;leaf&quot;; and the next two (3 and 4) are formed of two leaves. This pattern is repeated at the top, so that only levels 5 to 38 extend around the whole of the building.

The limitations of the design were immediately apparent - even though the building opened six years before Big Bang, and so there was less of a requirement for large trading floors, the bank decided not to locate its foreign exchange and money market trading operation (&quot;World Money Centre&quot;) in the tower; the unit remained in its existing location at 53 Threadneedle Street. Other international banking units, such as International Westminster Bank&#x27;s London Branch and the Nostro Reconciliations Department remained at their locations (at 41 Threadneedle Street and Park House, Finsbury Square, respectively) due to lack of space in the tower.

Innovative features in the design included double-decked lifts, which provide an express service between the ground/mezzanine levels and the sky lobbies at levels 23 and 24. Double-decked lifts and sky lobbies were both new to the UK at the time. Other innovative features included an internal automated &quot;mail train&quot; used for mail deliveries and document distribution; an automated external window washing system; and computer controlled air conditioning. The tower also had its own telephone exchange in one of the basement levels – this area was decorated with panoramic photographs of the London skyline, creating the illusion of being above ground. 
Fire suppression design features included pressurised stairwells, smoke venting and fire retardant floor barriers. However, at the time of design, fire sprinkler systems were not mandatory in the UK and so were not installed. 

The cantilever is constructed to take advantage of the air rights granted to it and the neighbouring site whilst respecting the banking hall on that adjacent site, as only one building was allowed to be developed. For a time it was the tallest cantilever in the world.

==Ownership==
Following NatWest&#x27;s refurbishment of the tower, the bank renamed it the International Finance Centre, in 1997.
The building was subsequently acquired by Hermes Real Estate and BlackRock&#x27;s UK property fund in 1998 for 226 million. In 2010 they put the property on the market at an expected price of 300 million. This would potentially have been the largest single commercial property sale in the City of London in 2010. In July 2010 it was reported that Chinese Estates Group had entered exclusive discussions to buy Tower 42. but this deal did not conclude and it was sold in 2011 to South African businessman Nathan Kirsh for £282.5 million.

==Occupancy==
===NatWest occupation===

Upon completion, the tower was occupied by a large part of NatWest&#x27;s International Division. The upper floors were occupied by the division&#x27;s executive management, marketing, and regional offices, moving from various locations in the City of London. The lower floors were occupied by NatWest&#x27;s Overseas Branch, moving from its previous location at 52/53 Threadneedle Street.

The adjacent annexe building at 27 Old Broad Street was occupied by NatWest&#x27;s Overseas Branch cashiers and foreign notes and coin dealing operation.

===1993 bombing and refurbishment===
In 1993, NatWest had planned a major premises relocation that would have seen the International Banking Division move from the tower and be replaced with its Domestic Banking Division, enabling the bank to terminate its lease of the Drapers Gardens tower. These plans had to be abandoned after the tower was damaged in the April 1993 Bishopsgate bombing, a Provisional Irish Republican Army truck bombing in the Bishopsgate area of the City of London. The bomb killed one person and extensively damaged the tower and many other buildings in the vicinity, causing a total of over £1 billion worth of damage to the area. The tower suffered severe damage and had to be entirely reclad and internally refurbished at a cost of £75 million. (Demolition was considered, but would have been too difficult and expensive.) The external re-clad was carried out by Alternative Access Logistics with the use of a multi-deck space frame system to access three floors at once with the ability to move up and down the whole building.

On 17 January 1996, during the repairs and possibly from the welding being undertaken, a fire started at the top of the building. Five hundred workmen were evacuated and smoke was seen coming out of the top of the building. A helicopter using thermal imaging equipment pinpointed the source of the fire, which was on the 45th floor in a glass-fibre cooling tower. After refurbishment, NatWest decided not to re-occupy and renamed the building the International Financial Centre, then sold it in 1998 to UK property company Greycoat, who renamed it Tower 42, a reference to its 42 cantilevered floors. It is now a general-purpose office building.

===Lighting display===
In June 2012, a Capix LED multi-media lighting system was installed around levels 39 to 45. This replaced the previous high-energy floodlighting at the top of the building. The lighting system forms thousands of pixels mounted on a chain netting that is affixed to the surface of the building. Each pixel is formed of three RGB LED units, allowing a variety of lighting designs and colours to be displayed. The system was designed by SVM Associates and Zumtobel.

The display featured the Olympic Rings during the London 2012 Olympic Games and the Paralympic Agitos during the London 2012 Paralympic Games.

==Ranking among London high-rise buildings==
The National Westminster Tower was the tallest building in London and the United Kingdom for 10 years. At its completion in 1980, it claimed this title from the 189-metre (620 ft) with antenna Post Office Tower, a transmission tower located in Fitzrovia.
By 2022, Tower 42 was the sixth-tallest tower in the City of London, and the 18th-tallest in London overall.

==Previous buildings on the site==
* Gresham House, built in 1563 by Sir Thomas Gresham. Gresham was a businessman who helped set up the Royal Exchange. Upon the death of his wife in 1596, Gresham House became the &#x27;Institute for Physic, Civil Law, Music, Astronomy, Geometry and Rhetoric&#x27;, as directed by Gresham&#x27;s will (Sir Thomas died 17 years earlier). Professors at Gresham College, described as the Third University of England by Chief Justice Coke in 1612, included Robert Hooke, Sir Christopher Wren and the composer John Bull. The building survived the Great Fire Of London, and saw use as a garrison, a Guildhall and Royal exchange. The College moved to Gresham Street. Gresham House was demolished in 1768 and a new Gresham House was built in its place.
* Crosby Hall, built in 1466 and named after its builder, the London merchant and alderman, Sir John Crosby. Its most famous occupant was King Richard III. A famous visitor was William Shakespeare. A scene of his play, &quot;Richard III&quot;, in which the future Richard III, then Duke of Gloucester, plots his route to the crown, is set in Crosby Hall.
* Crosby Place, which was built in 1596, the year that &quot;Richard III&quot; was written.
* Palmerston House was a building that survived from the 19th century, through both world wars. It was named after the Third Viscount Palmerston. It stood at 51-55 Broad Street. It was occupied for some time by the Cunard Steam Shipping Company.

==Events==
An annual charity fundraising event called Vertical Rush takes place inside Tower 42. It is a vertical run of 932 steps to the top of the tower. The 2024 event, raising money for Shelter, took place on 28 February.

<doc id="188624" wikidata="Q310821" url="?curid=188624" title="Rabbi Akiva">
<text>Akiva ben Joseph (Mishnaic Hebrew: ; – 28 September 135 CE), also known as Rabbi Akiva (), was a leading Jewish scholar and sage, a &quot;tanna&quot; of the latter part of the first century and the beginning of the second. Rabbi Akiva was a leading contributor to the &quot;Mishnah&quot; and to Midrash halakha. He is referred to in Tosafot as &quot;Rosh la-Hakhamim&quot; (&quot;Chief of the Sages&quot;). He was executed by the Romans in the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt. He has also been described as a philosopher. 

== Biography ==
===Early years===
Akiva ben Joseph (written in the Babylonian Talmud and in the Jerusalem Talmud), born , was of humble parentage. According to some sources, he was descended from converts to Judaism.

When Akiva married the daughter of Ben Kalba Sabuaʿ (), a wealthy citizen of Jerusalem, Akiva was an uneducated shepherd employed by him. The first name of Akiva&#x27;s wife is not provided in earlier sources, but a later version of the tradition gives it as Rachel. She stood loyally by her husband during the period of his late initiation into rabbinic studies after he was 40 years of age, and in which Akiva dedicated himself to the study of Torah.

A different tradition narrates that, at the age of 40, Akiva attended the academy of his native town, Lod, presided over by Eliezer ben Hurcanus. Hurcanus was a neighbour of Joseph, the father of Akiva. The fact that Eliezer was his first teacher, and the only one whom Akiva later designates as &quot;rabbi&quot;, is of importance in settling the date of Akiva&#x27;s birth. These legends set the beginning of his years of study at about 75–80.

Besides Eliezer, Akiva studied under Joshua ben Hananiah and Nachum Ish Gamzu. According to the Jerusalem Talmud, R. Joshua ordained Akiva as his fellow-student, presumably with &quot;semikhah&quot;. Akiva was on equal footing with Gamaliel II, whom he later met. Rabbi Tarfon was considered as one of Akiva&#x27;s masters, but the pupil outranked his teacher and he became one of Akiva&#x27;s greatest admirers. Akiva remained in Lod as long as Eliezer dwelt there, and then moved his own school to Beneberak. Akiva also lived for some time at Ziphron, modern Zafran near Hamath.

===Marriage===
According to the Talmud, Akiva was a shepherd for Ben Kalba Sabuaʿ when the latter&#x27;s daughter noticed his modesty and fine character traits. She offered to marry him if he would agree to begin studying Torah, as at the time he was 40 years old and illiterate. When her father found out she was secretly betrothed to an unlearned man, he was furious. He drove his daughter out of his house, swearing that he would never help her while Akiva remained her husband. Akiva and his wife lived in such poverty that they used straw for their bed. The Talmud relates that once Elijah the prophet assumed the guise of a poor man and came to their door to beg for some straw for a bed for his wife after she had given birth. When Akiva and his wife saw that there were people even poorer than they, Rachel said to him, &quot;Go, and become a scholar&quot;.

By agreement with his wife, Akiva spent twelve years away from home, pursuing his studies. He would make a living by cutting wood from the forest, selling half for his wife&#x27;s and children&#x27;s wellbeing, and using the other half for keeping a fire burning at night to keep himself warm and to provide light thereby for his own studies. Returning at the end of twelve years accompanied by 12,000 disciples, at the point of entering his home he overheard his wife say to a neighbour who was critical of his long absence: &quot;If I had my wish, he should stay another twelve years at the academy.&quot; Without crossing the threshold, Akiva went back to the academy. He returned twelve years later escorted by 24,000 disciples. When his wife went out to greet him, some of his students, not knowing who she was, sought to restrain her. But Akiva exclaimed, &quot;Let her alone; for what is mine and yours, is hers&quot; (she deserves the credit for our Torah study). Not knowing who he was, Ben Kalba Sabuaʿ also approached Akiva and asked him for help annulling his vow to disown his daughter and her husband. Akiva asked him, &quot;Would you have made your vow if you had known that he would become a great scholar?&quot; Ben Kalba Sabuaʿ replied, &quot;Had I known that he would learn even one chapter or one single Halakha, [I would not have made the vow]&quot;. Akiva said to him, &quot;I am that man&quot;. Ben Kalba Sabuaʿ fell at Akiva&#x27;s feet and gave him half his wealth.

According to another source, Akiva saw that at some future time he would take in marriage the wife of Turnus Rufus (his executioner, also known as Quintus Tineius Rufus) after she converted to Judaism, for which reason he spat on the ground (for having come from a fetid drop), smiled (at her conversion) and wept (at such beauty eventually rotting in the dust after death). The motive behind this marriage is not given.

===Later years===
The greatest tannaim of the middle of the second century came from Akiva&#x27;s school, notably Rabbi Meir, Judah bar Ilai, Simeon bar Yochai, Jose ben Halafta, Eleazar ben Shammua, and Rabbi Nehemiah. Besides these, Akiva had many disciples whose names have not been handed down, but the &quot;Aggadah&quot; variously gives their number as 12,000, 24,000 and 48,000.

Akiva is reported to have had a rabbinic relationship with Rabban Gamaliel dated as before their trip to Rome. Convinced of the necessity of a central authority for Judaism, Akiva became a devoted adherent and friend of Rabban Gamaliel, who aimed at constituting the patriarch the true spiritual chief of the Jews. However, Akiva was just as firmly convinced that the power of the patriarch must be limited both by the written and the oral law, the interpretation of which lay in the hands of the learned; and he was accordingly brave enough to act in ritual matters in Rabban Gamaliel&#x27;s own house contrary to the decisions of Rabban Gamaliel himself. Akiva filled the office of an overseer of the poor. Various rabbinic texts testify to his personal qualities, such as benevolence and kindness toward the sick and needy.

In 95–96 CE, Akiva was in Rome, and some time before 110 he was in Nehardea. During his travels, it is probable that he visited other places having important Jewish communities.

Akiva allegedly took part in the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136, but his role here is not historically determined. The only established fact concerning Akiva&#x27;s connection with Bar Kochba is that he regarded Bar Kochba as the promised Messiah; this is the only evidence of active participation by Akiva in the revolution. Some modern scholars argue that Akiva&#x27;s thousands of students died fighting for Bar Kochba, but this opinion was first formulated by Nachman Krochmal around 200 years ago and has no earlier source. A &quot;baraita&quot; states that Akiva suffered martyrdom on account of his transgression of Hadrian&#x27;s edicts against the practice and the teaching of the Jewish religion, being sentenced to die by Turnus Rufus in Caesarea. As this story credits the execution to religious rather than political reasons, it may be evidence against Akiva&#x27;s having a role in the revolt. Akiva&#x27;s death occurred after several years of imprisonment, which places it at about 132, before the suppression of the Bar Kochba revolution; otherwise the delay of the Romans in executing him would be quite inexplicable. That the religious interdicts of Hadrian preceded the overthrow of Bar Kochba is shown by the Mekhilta.

Jewish sources relate that he was subjected to combing, a Roman torture in which the victim&#x27;s skin was flayed with iron combs.

===Death===

The death of Akiva is usually rendered as some redacted form of three separate versions of the circumstances. Each version shares the same basic plot points: Akiva defies the Roman prohibition on teaching Torah, the consul Turnus Rufus orders his execution, Akiva is flayed alive, and his final words are the Shema prayer. 

The most common version of Akiva&#x27;s death is that the Roman government ordered him to stop teaching Torah, on pain of death, and that he refused. When Turnus Rufus, as he is called in Jewish sources, ordered Akiva&#x27;s execution, Akiva is said to have recited his prayers calmly, though suffering agonies; and when Rufus asked him whether he was a sorcerer, since he felt no pain, Akiva replied, &quot;I am no sorcerer; but I rejoice at the opportunity now given to me to love my God &#x27;with all my life,&#x27; seeing that I have hitherto been able to love Him only &#x27;with all my means&#x27; and &#x27;with all my might.&#x27;&quot; He began reciting the Shema, and with the word &quot;Echad&quot;, &quot;[God is] One!&quot;, he expired.

The version in the Babylonian Talmud tells it as a response of Akiva to his students, who asked him how he could yet offer prayers to God. He says to them, &quot;All my life I was worried about the verse, &#x27;with all your soul&#x27; (and the sages expounded this to signify), even if He takes away your soul. And I said to myself, when will I ever be able to fulfil this command? And now that I am finally able to fulfil it, I should not?&quot; Then he said the Shema and he extended the final word &quot;Echad&quot; (&quot;One&quot;) until his life expired with that word. A heavenly voice went out and announced: &quot;Blessed are you, Rabbi Akiva, that your life expired with &quot;Echad&quot;&quot;.

Another legend is that Elijah bore the body by night to Caesarea. The night, however, was as bright as the finest summer&#x27;s day. When they arrived, Elijah and Joshua entered a cavern that contained a bed, table, chair, and lamp, and deposited Akiva&#x27;s body there. No sooner had they left it than the cavern closed of its own accord, so that no one has found it since. Rebbe Akiva&#x27;s modern day tomb is located in Tiberias. Annually, on the night of Lag BaOmer, pilgrims light bonfires at the tomb of Rebbe Akiva. The pilgrims include some from Boston, Massachusetts, a tradition reinstated by the Bostoner Rebbe in 1983.

==Religious and scholarly perspectives==

=== Religious philosophy ===

A Tannaitic tradition mentions that of the four who delved into the Pardes (legend), Akiva was the only one who was able to properly absorb this wisdom, with the other three suffering various consequences as a result of the attempt. This serves at least to show how strong in later ages was the recollection of Akiva&#x27;s philosophical speculation.

As to the creation of man and his actions, Akiva would say: &quot;All things are foreseen [by God], yet the freedom to choose is given [unto man], and the world is judged on [its] merits, while everything is according to the preponderance of [good or bad] works.&quot; 

====The relationship between God and man====

Akiva&#x27;s opinion about the very creation of man is recorded in Pirkei Avot:

: How favoured is man, for he was created after an image; as Scripture says, &quot;for in an image, God made man.&quot;

Akiva&#x27;s ontology is based upon the principle that man was created בצלם, that is, not in the image of God—which would be בצלם אלהים—but after an image, after a primordial type; or, philosophically speaking, after an Idea—what Philo calls in agreement with Judean theology, &quot;the first heavenly man&quot; (see Adam ḳadmon). Strict monotheist that Akiva was, he protested against any comparison of God with the angels, and declared the plain interpretation of כאחד ממנו as meaning &quot;like one of us&quot; to be arrant blasphemy. It is quite instructive to read how a Christian of Akiva&#x27;s generation, Justin Martyr, calls the literal interpretation—thus objected to by Akiva—a &quot;Jewish heretical one&quot;. In his earnest endeavours to insist as strongly as possible upon the incomparable nature of God, Akiva indeed lowers the angels somewhat to the realms of mortals, and (alluding to Psalms 78:25) maintains that manna is the actual food of the angels. This view of Akiva&#x27;s, in spite of the energetic protests of his colleague Rabbi Ishmael, became the one generally accepted by his contemporaries.

From his views as to the relation between God and man, he deduces that a murderer is to be considered as committing the crime against the divine archetype (דמות) of man. Similarly, he recognizes as the chief and greatest principle of Judaism the command, &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&quot; He does not, indeed, maintain thereby that the execution of this command is equivalent to the performance of the whole Law; and in one of his polemic interpretations of Scripture he protests strongly against a contrary opinion allegedly held by Christians, and other non-Jews since the diaspora, according to which Judaism is at best &quot;simply morality.&quot; For, in spite of his philosophy, Akiva was an extremely strict and national Jew.

But he is far from representing strict justice as the only attribute of God: in agreement with the ancient Israel theology of the מדת הדין, &quot;the attribute of justice&quot;, and מדת הרחמים, &quot;the attribute of mercy,&quot; he teaches that God combines goodness and mercy with strict justice. Hence his maxim, referred to above, &quot;God rules the world in mercy, but according to the preponderance of good or bad in human acts.&quot;

===Eschatology===
As to the question concerning the frequent sufferings of the pious and the prosperity of the wicked—truly a burning one in Akiva&#x27;s time—this is answered by the explanation that the pious are punished in this life for their few sins, so that in the next they may receive only reward; while the wicked obtain in this world all the recompense for the little good they have done, and in the next world will receive only punishment for their misdeeds. Consistent as Akiva always was, his ethics and his views of justice were only the strict consequences of his philosophical system. Justice as an attribute of God must also be exemplary for man. &quot;No mercy in [civil] justice!&quot; is his basic principle in the doctrine concerning law, and he does not conceal his opinion that the action of the Jews in taking the spoil of the Egyptians is to be condemned.

===Biblical canon===

Akiva was instrumental in drawing up the canon of the Tanakh. He protested strongly against the canonicity of certain of the Apocrypha, the Wisdom of Sirach, for instance, in which passages קורא is to be explained according to Kiddushin 49a, and חיצונים according to its Aramaic equivalent ברייתא; so that Akiva&#x27;s utterance reads, &quot;He who reads aloud in the synagogue from books not belonging to the canon as if they were canonical,&quot; etc. But he was not opposed to a private reading of the Apocrypha, as is evident from the fact that he himself makes frequent use of Sirach. Akiva stoutly defended, however, the canonicity of the Song of Songs, and Esther. Grätz&#x27;s statements respecting Akiva&#x27;s attitude toward the canonicity of the Song of Songs were viewed as misconceptions by I.H. Weiss.

Aquila, meanwhile, was a disciple of Akiva and, under Akiva&#x27;s guidance, gave the Greek-speaking Jews a rabbinical Bible. Akiva probably also provided for a revised text of the Targums; certainly, for the essential base of the Targum Onkelos, which in matters of Halakha reflects Akiva&#x27;s opinions completely.

=== Akiva as systematizer ===
Akiva worked in the domain of the Halakha, both in the systematization of its traditional material and in its further development. The condition of the Halakha, that is, of religious praxis, and indeed of Judaism in general, was a very precarious one at the turn of the 1st century of the common era. The lack of any systematized collection of the accumulated halachot rendered impossible any presentation of them in a form suitable for practical purposes. Means for the theoretical study of the Halakha were also scant; both logic and exegesis—the two props of the Halakha—being differently conceived by the various rulings Tannaim, and differently taught. According to a tradition (which has historical confirmation), it was Akiva who systematized and arranged the &quot;Mishna&quot; (the halakhic codex); the &quot;midrash&quot; (the exegesis of the Halkha), and the &quot;halachot&quot; (the logical amplification of the Halakha). The Mishna of Akiva, as his pupil Rabbi Meir had taken it from him, became the basis of the Six Orders of the Mishna.

The &quot;δευτερώσεις τοῦ καλουμένου Ραββὶ Ακιβά&quot; (&quot;Mishnah of the one called &quot;Rabbi Akiva&quot;&quot;) mentioned by Epiphanius, as well as the &quot;great Mishnayot of Akiva&quot;, are probably not to be understood as independent Mishnayot (δευτερώσεις) existing at that time, but as the teachings and opinions of Akiva contained in the officially recognized Mishnayot and Midrashim. At the same time, it is fair to consider the Mishnah of Judah ha-Nasi (called simply &quot;the Mishnah&quot;), as well as the majority of all halakhic Midrashim now extant, as derived from the school of Akiva.

According to Joḥanan bar Nappaḥa (199–279), &quot;Our Mishnah comes directly from Rabbi Meir, the Tosefta from R. Nehemiah, the Sifra from R. Judah, and the Sifre from R. Simon; but they all took Akiva for a model in their works and followed him.&quot; One recognizes here the threefold division of the halakhic material that emanated from Akiva: (1) The codified halakhah (i.e. Mishnah); (2) the Tosefta, which in its original form contains a concise logical argument for the Mishnah, somewhat like the &quot;Lebush&quot; of Mordecai Jafe on the Shulchan Aruch; (3) the halakhic Midrash.

The following halakhic Midrashim originating in Akiva&#x27;s school: the Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon on Exodus; Sifra on Leviticus; Sifre Zuṭṭa on Numbers; and the Sifre to Deuteronomy, the halakhic portion of which belongs to Akiva&#x27;s school.

=== Akiva&#x27;s Halakha ===

Akiva was responsible not only for systematization of the Halakha, but also for hermeneutics and halakhic exegesis, which form the foundation of all Talmudic learning.

The enormous difference between the Halakha before and after Akiva may be briefly described as follows: The old Halakha was (as its name indicates) the religious practice sanctioned as binding by tradition, to which were added extensions and (in some cases) limitations of the Torah, arrived at by strict logical deduction. The opposition offered by the Sadducees (which became especially strenuous in the first century BC) led to the development of the halakhic midrash, whose purpose was to deduce these amplifications of the Law, by tradition and logic, out of the Law itself.

It might be thought that with the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem—which event made an end of Sadduceeism—the halakhic Midrash would also have disappeared, seeing that the Halakha could now dispense with the Midrash. This likely would have been the case had not Akiva created his own Midrash, by means of which he was able &quot;to discover things that were even unknown to Moses.&quot; Akiva made the accumulated treasure of the oral law—which until his time was only a subject of knowledge, and not a science—an inexhaustible mine from which, by the means he provided, new treasures might be continually extracted.

If the older Halakha is to be considered as the product of the internal struggle between Phariseeism and Sadduceeism, the Halakha of Akiva has been viewed as the result of an external contest between Judaism on the one hand and Hellenism and Hellenistic Christianity on the other. Akiva no doubt perceived that the intellectual bond uniting the Jews—far from being allowed to disappear with the destruction of the Jewish state—must be made to draw them closer together than before. He pondered also the nature of that bond. The Bible could never again fill the place alone; for the Christians also regarded it as a divine revelation. Still less could dogma serve the purpose, for dogmas were always repellent to rabbinical Judaism, whose very essence is development and the susceptibility to development. Mention has already been made of the fact that Akiva was the creator of a rabbinical Bible version elaborated with the aid of his pupil, Aquila (though this is traditionally debated), and designed to become the common property of all Jews.

But this was not sufficient to obviate all threatening danger. It was to be feared that the Jews, by their facility in accommodating themselves to surrounding —even then a marked characteristic—might become entangled in the net of Grecian philosophy, and even in that of Gnosticism. The example of his colleagues and friends, Elisha ben Abuyah, Ben Azzai, and Ben Zoma strengthened him still more in his conviction of the necessity of providing some counterpoise to the intellectual influence of the non-Jewish world.

=== Akiva&#x27;s hermeneutic system ===

Akiva sought to apply the system of isolation followed by the Pharisees (פרושים = those who &quot;separate&quot; themselves) to doctrine as they did to practice, to the intellectual life as they did to that of daily discourse, and he succeeded in furnishing a firm foundation for his system. As the fundamental principle of his system, Akiva enunciates his conviction that the mode of expression used by the Torah is quite different from that of every other book. In the language of the Torah nothing is mere form; everything is essence. It has nothing superfluous; not a word, not a syllable, not even a letter. Every peculiarity of diction, every particle, every sign, is to be considered as of higher importance, as having a wider relation and as being of deeper meaning than it seems to have. Like Philo, who saw in the Hebrew construction of the infinitive with the finite form of the same verb and in certain particles (adverbs, prepositions, etc.) some deep reference to philosophical and ethical doctrines, Akiva perceived in them indications of many important ceremonial laws, legal statutes, and ethical teachings.

He thus gave the Jewish mind not only a new field for its own employment, but, convinced both of the immutability of Holy Scripture and of the necessity for development in Judaism, he succeeded in reconciling these two apparently hopeless opposites by means of his remarkable method. The following two illustrations will serve to make this clear:

*The high conception of woman&#x27;s dignity, which Akiva shared in common with most other Pharisees, induced him to abolish the folk custom that banished ritually impure women from all social communication. He succeeded, moreover, in fully justifying his interpretation of those Scriptural passages upon which this ostracism could be incorrectly sourced.
*For him a &quot;Jewish slave&quot; is a contradiction in terms, for every Jew is to be regarded as a prince. Akiva therefore teaches, in opposition to the competing halakhah, that the sale of an underage daughter by her father conveys to her purchaser no legal title to marriage with her, but, on the contrary, carries with it the duty to keep the female slave until she is of age, and then to marry her. How Akiva endeavours to substantiate this from the Hebrew text is shown.

His hermeneutics frequently put him at odds with the interpretation of his colleagues, as particularly demonstrated by his attitude toward the Samaritans. He considered friendly discussion with these potential converts as desirable on political as well as on religious grounds, and he permitted not only eating their bread, but also intermarriage, considering them as full converts. This is quite remarkable, seeing that in matrimonial legislation he went so far as to declare every forbidden betrothal as absolutely void and the offspring as illegitimate. For similar reasons, Akiva rules leniently in the Biblical ordinance of &quot;Kil&#x27;ayim&quot;; nearly every chapter in the treatise of that name contains a mitigation by Akiva.

Love for the Holy Land, which he as a genuine nationalist frequently and warmly expressed, was so powerful with him that he would have exempted agriculture from much of the rigour of the Law. These examples will suffice to justify the opinion that Akiva was the man to whom Judaism owes pre-eminently its activity and its capacity for further development in accordance with the tradition he received.

== Selected legends ==

In a Talmudic sugya, Rav Yehudah narrates the story when Moses sees Rabbi Akiva (Menachot 29b). In this legend, Moses ascended to heaven (or Mount Sinai) and saw God preoccupied with making ornamental &quot;crowns&quot; for the letters of the Torah. When Moses inquired what the purpose of these embellishments were, God explained that a man named Akiva would be born in several generations, and that he would be able to deduce halakha from every little curve and crown of the letters of the Law. Moses requested that he be allowed to see this man, and God assented: Moses found himself sitting in Akiva&#x27;s study hall. As Moses listened to Akiva&#x27;s lesson, he grew weary, because he could not understand it. However, when one of the students asked Akiva for the source of his teaching, Akiva replied that it was &quot;A law to Moses at Sinai&quot;, and Moses was put at ease. When Moses returns to God and asks what the pious Akiva&#x27;s ultimate reward will be, he is shown the grisly aftermath of Akiva&#x27;s execution. Horrified, Moses demands God explain His actions, at which point God commands Moses to be silent and respect His judgement. According to Louis Ginzberg, &quot;this story gives in naïve style a picture of Akiba&#x27;s activity as the father of Talmudical Judaism.&quot;

Tinnius Rufus asked: &quot;Which is the more beautiful—God&#x27;s work or man&#x27;s?&quot; Akiva replied: &quot;Undoubtedly man&#x27;s work is the better, for while nature at God&#x27;s command supplies us only with the raw material, human skill enables us to elaborate the same according to the requirements of art and good taste.&quot; Rufus had hoped to drive Akiva into a corner by his strange question; for he expected quite a different answer and intended to compel Akiva to admit the wickedness of circumcision. He then put the question, &quot;Why has God not made man just as He wanted him to be?&quot; Akiva had an answer ready: &quot;For the very reason, man must perfect himself.&quot;

The aggadah explains how Akiva, in the prime of life, commenced his rabbinical studies. Legendary allusion to this change in Akiva&#x27;s life is made in two slightly varying forms. Likely the older of the two goes as follows: &quot;Akiva, noticing a stone at a well that had been hollowed out by drippings from the buckets, said: If these drippings can, by continuous action, penetrate this solid stone, how much more can the persistent word of God penetrate the pliant, fleshly human heart, if that word but be presented with patient insistency.&quot;

Akiva taught thousands of students: on one occasion, twenty-four thousand students of his died in a plague. His five main students were Judah bar Ilai, Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Eleazar ben Shammua, Jose ben Halafta and Shimon bar Yochai.

Once he was called upon to decide between a dark-skinned king and the king&#x27;s wife; the wife having been accused of infidelity after bearing a white child. Akiva ascertained that the royal chamber was adorned with white marble statuary, and, based on the theory that a child is similar in nature to whatever its parents gazed upon while conceiving the child, he exonerated the queen from suspicion. It is related that, during his stay in Rome, Akiva became intimately acquainted with the Jewish proselyte Ketia bar Shalom, a very influential Roman (according to some scholars identical with Flavius Clemens, Domitian&#x27;s nephew), who, before his execution for pleading the cause of the Jews, bequeathed to Akiva all his possessions.

The Talmud enumerates six occasions in which Akiva gained wealth. In one case, his success as a teacher led his wealthy father-in-law Kalba Savua to acknowledge such a distinguished son-in-law and to support him. Another source of his wealth was said to be a large sum of money borrowed from a heathen woman, a &quot;matrona&quot;. As bondsmen for the loan, Akiva named God and the sea, on the shore of which the matrona&#x27;s house stood. Akiva, being sick, could not return the money at the time appointed; but his bondsmen did not leave him in the lurch. An imperial princess suddenly became insane, in which condition she threw a chest containing imperial treasures into the sea. It was cast upon the shore close to the house of Akiva&#x27;s creditor, so that when the matrona went to the shore to demand of the sea the amount she had lent Akiva, the ebbing tide left boundless riches at her feet. Later, when Akiva arrived to discharge his indebtedness, the matrona not only refused to accept the money, but insisted upon Akiva&#x27;s receiving a large share of what the sea had brought to her.

This was not the only occasion on which Akiva was made to feel the truth of his favourite maxim (&quot;Whatever God does, He does for the best&quot;). Once, being unable to find any sleeping accommodation in a certain city, he was compelled to pass the night outside its walls. Without a murmur he resigned himself to this hardship; and even when a lion devoured his donkey, and a cat killed the rooster whose crowing was to herald the dawn to him, and the wind extinguished his candle, the only remark he made was, &quot;All that God does is for the good.&quot; When morning dawned he learned how true his words were. A band of robbers had fallen upon the city and carried its inhabitants into captivity, but he had escaped because his abiding place had not been noticed in the darkness, and neither beast nor fowl had betrayed him.

Another legend according to which the gates of the infernal regions opened for Akiva is analogous to the more familiar tale that he entered paradise and was allowed to leave it unscathed. There exists the following tradition: Akiva once met a coal-black man carrying a heavy load of wood and running with the speed of a horse. Akiva stopped him and inquired: &quot;My son, why do you work so hard? If you are a slave and have a harsh master, I will buy you from him. If it be out of poverty that you do this, I will take care of your needs.&quot; &quot;It is for neither of these,&quot; the man replied; &quot;I am dead and am compelled because of my great sins to build my funeral pyre every day. In life, I was a tax-gatherer and oppressed the poor. Let me go at once, lest the demon tortures me for my delay.&quot; &quot;Is there no help for you?&quot; asked Akiva. &quot;Almost none,&quot; replied the deceased; &quot;for I understand that my sufferings will end only when I have a pious son. When I died, my wife was pregnant; but I have little hope that she will give my child proper training.&quot; Akiva inquired about the man&#x27;s name and that of his wife and her dwelling place. When, in the course of his travels, he reached the place, Akiva sought information concerning the man&#x27;s family. The neighbours very freely expressed their opinion that the deceased and his wife deserved to inhabit the infernal regions for all time—the latter because she had not even performed brit milah for the child. Akiva, however, was not to be turned from his purpose; he sought the son of the tax-gatherer and laboured long and assiduously in teaching him the word of God. After fasting for 40 days and praying to God to bless his efforts, he heard a heavenly voice (bat kol) asking, &quot;Why do you go to so much trouble on behalf of this person?&quot; &quot;Because he is just the kind to work for,&quot; was the prompt answer. Akiva persevered until his pupil was able to officiate as a reader in the synagogue; and when there for the first time he recited the prayer, &quot;Bless the Lord!&quot; the father suddenly appeared to Akiva and overwhelmed him with thanks for his deliverance from the pains of hell through the merit of his son. This legend has been somewhat elaborately treated in Yiddish. Another version of this story exists in which Johanan ben Zakkai&#x27;s name is given in place of Akiva.

== In popular culture ==

Historical novels available in English which feature Akiva as a main character include:

* &quot;The Orchard&quot; [Hebrew] by Yochi Brandes (2012), translated into English by Daniel Libenson (2018)

According to Barry W. Holtz, &quot;It is no accident that Akiva has inspired works of fiction—not only because of his importance in Jewish religious history, but also because of the simple fact that so many of the details of his life are unknown and therefore grist for the mill of a novelist.&quot;

<text>Kaziuko mugė or Saint Casimir&#x27;s Fair is a large annual folk arts and crafts fair in Lithuania, dating to the beginning of the 17th century. The fair is traditionally held in city&#x27;s markets and streets on the Sunday nearest to 4 March (Feast of St. Casimir), the anniversary of Saint Casimir&#x27;s death. In Lithuanian, &quot;Kaziukas&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;Casimir&quot;. Today, Saint Casimir&#x27;s fair also features music, dance, theater performances; it attracts tens of thousands of visitors and many craftsmen from across Lithuania as well as from neighbouring countries such as Latvia, Russia, and Poland. In recent years, the fair has expanded into other cities in Lithuania, Belarus, Poland.

==History and location==

St. Casimir, son of King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir IV, was canonized in 1602. In conjunction with his feast day celebrations, merchants established a fair. In 1827, they received a privilege to hold the fair in the Cathedral Square. In 1901, after a monument to Catherine the Great was unveiled in the Cathedral Square, the fair was moved to Lukiškės Square. During the Soviet era, the fair was held in Kalvarijos Market. In 1991, it returned to the Old Town of Vilnius. It was first held in Pilies Street but has since grown to span Gediminas Avenue, traverse the Cathedral Square, and branch out into Pilies Street, B. Radvilaitės Street, passing St. Anne&#x27;s Church, and the Orthodox Cathedral of the Theotokos, and into the Tymas&#x27; Quarter on the left bank of Vilnia River near Užupis. It is estimated that as of 2013, the fair attracted 2,000 merchants and half a million visitors over three days (Friday to Sunday). In 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the fair was held online. Previously, the fair did not take place only during World War II.

In recent years the fair has expanded into other cities in Lithuania, including Kaunas (in Laisvės alėja and Town Hall Square), Alytus, Klaipėda. Similar festivals called &quot;Kaziuki&quot; are also held in several cities in Poland, e.g. in Lidzbark Warmiński, Olsztyn, Szczecin, Gdańsk and Poznań, as well as in Hrodna, Belarus, the city where St. Casimir died. A smaller version of the fair is also held by Lithuanian communities abroad, including inside the Lithuanian World Center in Lemont, Illinois.

==Features==

The arts and crafts at the fair include hand-made goods from local craftsmen, such as woven and knitted clothes, footwear, toys, utensils, pots and jugs, jewelry, souvenirs, and paintings. Traditional foodstuffs include rye bread, bubliks, gingerbread, natural honey, beer, gira, and colorfully wrapped hard candy. Crafts represented include wood carvers, blacksmiths, potters, weavers and knitters, wicker weavers.

Easter palms (, singular: &quot;verba&quot;) are one of the fair&#x27;s specialties. They are made of colourful dried wild flowers and herbs (about 150 different varieties of plants are used) tied around a wooden stick. Traditionally, they were taken to churches on Palm Sunday. Verba has become a traditional symbol of spring and Easter. However, it is an endangered craft. Making &quot;verba&quot; is difficult and time-consuming process. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find flowers and herbs or special dies to color them. The buyers are wary that the dried plants would cause allergic reactions.

Another signature product at the fair is the Casimir&#x27;s Heart, a heart-shaped gingerbread decorated with sugar patterns and figures (flowers, zigzags, birds, etc.) or popular given names. People buy them to give to their loved ones. It is customary to bring back some these to those who could not attend.

<text>Northwestern State University of Louisiana (NSULA) is a public university primarily situated in Natchitoches, Louisiana, with a nursing campus in Shreveport and general campuses in Leesville/Fort Johnson and Alexandria. It is a part of the University of Louisiana System.



NSU was founded in 1884 as the Louisiana State Normal School. It was the first school in Louisiana to offer degree programs in nursing and business education. NSU, along with numerous other state colleges, gained university status in 1970 during the administration of President Arnold R. Kilpatrick, a Northwestern State alumnus who served from 1966 to 1978. Kilpatrick succeeded the 12-year president, John S. Kyser, a native of El Paso, Illinois.

NSU was one of the first six colleges to enter into NASA&#x27;s Joint Venture Program. Students worked with NASA scientists to help analyze data and do research for the 1996 Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; shuttle mission. NSU also hosts the Louisiana Scholars&#x27; College, Louisiana&#x27;s designated honors college in the liberal arts and sciences. The Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, a state-supported residential high school for sophomores, juniors, and seniors, is also located on the campus. It was a brainchild of former State Representative Jimmy D. Long of Natchitoches, who also attended NSU.

NSU offers more than 50 degree programs. Fall 2018 total enrollment was 11,081, the largest in the university&#x27;s 133-year history, although the school saw enrollments decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, which hampered recruitment efforts.
NSU also claims more than 70,000 alumni.

==History==

Northwestern State University stands on ground that has been dedicated to learning for well over 100 years. Before the American Civil War, a portion of the present campus was the property of the Bullard family of Natchitoches. As early as 1856, the Bullard mansion was in use as a convent by the Religious Society of the Sacred Heart. The following year, a school building was erected at the convent, and in 1884, the town and parish of Natchitoches purchased the property. Three of the four great white columns that once supported the east gable of the mansion still stand on &quot;The Hill&quot; and serve as the unofficial symbols of the university.

In 1884, the Louisiana State Legislature by Act 51 created the Louisiana State Normal School for the preparation of teachers. Shortly thereafter, a freshman member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, Leopold Caspari of Natchitoches, offered the convent site as a campus for the school with the anticipated approval of the citizens of Natchitoches. The offer was accepted, and from 1885 to 1918, the school offered two years of study for the training of teachers. Baccalaureate programs were inaugurated, and the Louisiana Constitution of 1921 changed the name of the school to Louisiana State Normal College. In 1944, the institution&#x27;s excellent service in its broader role was accorded formal recognition by Act 326 of the Legislature, which changed its name to Northwestern State College of Louisiana.

Northwestern State maintained and strengthened its tradition of leadership in public service and academic endeavor and became, in 1954, the first college under the jurisdiction of the Louisiana State Board of Education to offer a master&#x27;s degree. The Specialist in Education degree was first offered in 1966 and the Doctor of Philosophy in Education degrees were authorized in 1967. On June 18, 1970, Governor John J. McKeithen signed a legislative act that brought the old campus its greatest distinction, changing its title to Northwestern State University of Louisiana. In 1980, the old campus quadrangle where the columns stand was entered into the National Register of Historic Places under the title &quot;Normal Hill Historic District.&quot;

Although primarily a regional institution, Northwestern State also offers an opportunity for education at satellite locations, including Leesville, Shreveport, and Alexandria. The Nursing Education Center, located in Shreveport, provides the educational environment for nursing majors enrolled in clinical courses, as well as general education courses.

A large piece of limestone, known as &quot;The Rock&quot; was placed on campus in 2006 at a major intersection for registered student organizations to paint designs promoting their groups. The list of student organizations available grows every semester.

In 2012, the university, along with Southeastern Louisiana University and Louisiana State University was censured by the American Association of University Professors for violations of AAUP standards on faculty rights. In response, Randy Moffett, then University of Louisiana System president, said that “placing universities on a censure list has little, if any, practical implication.&quot;

In 2021, Marcus Jones became the first African-American President in the university&#x27;s 137-year history after he was unanimously approved by the Louisiana Board of Supervisors. Four years later, in 2024, he was succeeded by Louisiana Supreme Court Associate Justice James Genovese. 

===Vic the Demon===
On November 8, 1922, by proclamation of President V. L. Roy and Coach H. Lee Prather, all athletic teams became known as the Demons. The name was decided upon by a contest open to all students, with a grand prize of $10. A committee was appointed by the president to narrow down the names submitted by the student body. The final selection was decided by a vote of the students. The two most popular choices were Braves and Demons. Among other names submitted by students were Sharks, Daredevils, Musketeers, Pelicans, Prather&#x27;s Ground Hogs, Bloodhounds, Cyclops, and Serpents. The official winners were Aileen Ritter and Truett Scarborough.

On September 22, 1984, the Demon received his official given name using another contest sponsored by the athletic department. The contest was open to faculty, staff, and students. The objective was to find a name for the Demon. Over 300 entries were submitted to the committee. The grand prize was an all-expenses-paid weekend at the Louisiana State Fair Classic. Ray Carney, an alumnus of the university, was the official winner with &quot;Vic&quot;, which is short for &quot;Victory&quot;.

===Jim Croce===
Singer-songwriter Jim Croce died in a plane crash hours after finishing a 1973 concert on the NSU campus.

==Student media==
===Newspaper and yearbook===
Northwestern&#x27;s online news source with occasional printed special editions, &quot;The Current Sauce&quot;, was founded in 1914. In 2021, the newspaper and campus radio station, KNWD, merged their news operations into a shared digital platform, &quot;Purple Media Network.&quot; Its annual student-run yearbook is called &quot;The Potpourri&quot;.

===Radio and television===
The student-run radio station is The Demon (KNWD 91.7 FM) and a faculty-administered and student-operated local television station is NSU22, on which can be found biweekly student-produced newscasts.

===Literary magazine===
NSU&#x27;s literary magazine is called &quot;The Argus&quot;. It is student-run and published during the spring semester. The magazine content is provided by competitions in various fields of writing and artwork.
==Music==
The &quot;Spirit of Northwestern&quot; marching band features over 300 members each year, with membership open to any major and classification of student. Their uniforms are purple and white with a thin orange stripe. Other bands at Northwestern are the Pep Band, Symphonic Band, Wind Symphony, Wind Ensemble, Jazz Ensemble, numerous chamber groups, and the Natchitoches-Northwestern Symphony Orchestra.
==Athletics==

The Northwestern State athletic teams go by the Demons, with women&#x27;s athletic teams generally called the Lady Demons, and its mascot is Vic the Demon. The university is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and competes in the Southland Conference at the NCAA Division I level. Northwestern State sponsors 12 varsity athletic teams, five men&#x27;s teams and seven women&#x27;s teams. The official list of sports changes by semester as new groups are approved.

==Archive==
NSU maintains an archive through the Cammie G. Henry Research Center. Collections cover a diversity of individuals and topics. Materials may be accessed on such figures as Ethma Odum, the pioneering woman television personality at KALB-TV in Alexandria; James B. Aswell, Kate Chopin, Robert DeBlieux, Caroline Dormon, and the Cane River.
