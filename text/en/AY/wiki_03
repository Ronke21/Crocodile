<text>Sir Arthur William &quot;A.W.&quot; Coles (7 August 1892 – 14 June 1982) was a prominent Australian businessman and philanthropist, a son of St James, Victoria shopkeeper George W. Coles (died 1932).

With his brothers George James &quot;G.J.&quot; (1885–1977), Kenneth Frank &quot;K.F.&quot; (1896 –1985), Edgar Barton &quot;E.B.&quot; (1899–1981), and Norman Cameron &quot;N.C.&quot; Coles (1907–1989), A. W. Coles founded Coles Variety Stores in the 1920s, which was to become Coles Group, one of the two largest supermarket chains in Australia.

He served as Lord Mayor of Melbourne from 1938 to 1940.

In 1940 he was elected to the federal parliament as an Independent from Henty. With Alexander Wilson, he held the balance of power, at first keeping the UAP-National government in office, but in 1941 switching sides to install a new Australian Labor Party government.

In 1946 Coles was appointed chair of the Australian National Airways Commission, which founded Trans Australia Airlines (later known as Australian Airlines, which became the domestic arm of Qantas).

==Early life==
Arthur Coles was born in Geelong, Victoria and educated at the elite private school The Geelong College. When World War I began, Coles enlisted as a private, fighting at Gallipoli and on the Western Front in France, and was wounded on three occasions before being commissioned as a lieutenant.

==Coles Variety Stores==
Coles returned to Australia in 1919 and married Lillian Knight. He joined with two brothers and an uncle to open a variety store in Collingwood, a working-class suburb of Melbourne. Working on the slogan &quot;Nothing over 2/6&quot;, the business grew rapidly. The family opened a series of new Coles Variety Stores around the country, Arthur moving to Sydney in 1928 to open and manage the first one in New South Wales. In 1931, at the height of the Great Depression, he returned to Melbourne to become managing director, a post he held until 1944. G. J. Coles &amp; Co became the largest retailer in Australia.

==Lord Mayor and federal politics==
Coles became Lord Mayor of Melbourne in 1938, remaining in that position until 1940. Thereupon he resigned to stand for the federal seat of Henty as an independent candidate. Coles was one of the two independent parliamentarians (the other was Alexander Wilson) who held the balance of power through the early years of the Second World War. He supported the United Australia Party (UAP) government of Robert Menzies and in 1941 began attending UAP partyroom meetings. He officially joined the UAP on 26 June 1941.

After Menzies was deposed, both Coles and Wilson men crossed the floor in 1941 to remove the hapless UAP-Country Party government of Arthur Fadden. Governor-General Lord Gowrie was reluctant to call an election for a Parliament barely a year old, especially given the international situation. He summoned Coles and Wilson and made them promise that if he named Labor leader John Curtin prime minister, they would support him for the remainder of the Parliament to end the instability in government. The independents agreed, assuring Curtin&#x27;s accession.

In 1944, Coles retired from business and devoted himself to public works, becoming the chair of both the Commonwealth Rationing Commission and the War Damage Commission. With the end of the war, he resigned from the legislature to become chair of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines (BCPA) and the Australian National Airlines Commission (see Trans Australia Airlines). He was appointed chair of the Melbourne Olympic Games Committee in 1952, and a member of the CSIRO Advisory Council in 1956.

Knighted in 1960, Coles lived mostly in retirement from 1965. He died in 1982, leaving three sons and three daughters.

<text>Apelles of Kos (; ; fl. 4th century BC) was a renowned painter of ancient Greece. Pliny the Elder, to whom much of modern scholars&#x27; knowledge of this artist is owed (&quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; 35.36.79–97 and &quot;passim&quot;), rated him superior to preceding and subsequent artists. He dated Apelles to the 112th Olympiad (332–329 BC), possibly because he had produced a portrait of Alexander the Great.

== Biography ==
Probably born at Colophon in Ionia, he first studied under Ephorus of Ephesus, but after he had attained some celebrity he became a student to Pamphilus at Sicyon He thus combined the Dorian thoroughness with the Ionic grace. Attracted to the court of Philip II, he painted him and the young Alexander with such success that he became the recognized court painter of Macedon, and his picture of Alexander holding a thunderbolt ranked in the minds of many with the Alexander with the spear of the sculptor Lysippus. Hundreds of years later, Plutarch was among the unimpressed, deciding that it had failed to accurately reproduce Alexander&#x27;s colouring: &quot;He made Alexander&#x27;s complexion appear too dark-skinned and swarthy, whereas we are told that he was fair-skinned, with a ruddy tinge that showed itself especially upon his face and chest.&quot;

Much of what is known of Apelles is derived from Pliny the Elder (&quot;Natural History&quot;, XXXV). His skill at drawing the human face is the focus of a story connecting him with Ptolemy I Soter. This onetime general of Alexander disliked Apelles while they both were in Alexander&#x27;s retinue. Many years later, while travelling by sea, a storm forced Apelles to land in Ptolemy&#x27;s Egyptian kingdom. Ptolemy&#x27;s jester was suborned by Apelles&#x27; rivals to convey to the artist a spurious invitation to dine with Ptolemy. Apelles&#x27; unexpected arrival enraged the king. Ptolemy demanded to know who had given Apelles the invitation, and with a piece of charcoal from the fireplace Apelles drew a likeness on the wall, which Ptolemy recognized as his jester in the first strokes of the sketch.

Apelles was a contemporary of Protogenes, whose reputation he advocated. Pliny also recorded an anecdote that was making the rounds among Hellenistic connoisseurs of the first century CE: Apelles travelled to Protogenes&#x27; home in Rhodes to make the acquaintance of this painter he had heard so much about. Arriving at Protogenes&#x27; studio, he encountered an old woman who told him that Protogenes was out and asked for his name so she could report who had enquired after him. Observing in the studio a panel Protogenes had prepared for a painting, Apelles walked over to the easel, and taking up a brush told the servant to tell Protogenes &quot;this came from me,&quot; and drew in colour an extremely fine line across the panel. When Protogenes returned, and the old woman explained what had taken place, he examined the line and pronounced that only Apelles could have done so perfect a piece of work; Protogenes then dipped a brush into another colour and drew a still finer line above the first one, and asked his servant to show this to the visitor should he return. When Apelles returned, and was shown Protogenes&#x27; response, ashamed that he might be bettered, he drew in a third colour an even finer line between the first two, leaving no room for another display of craftsmanship. On seeing this, Protogenes admitted defeat, and went out to seek Apelles and meet him face-to-face.
Pliny claims that this very painting had been part of the collection of Julius Caesar, but was destroyed when Caesar&#x27;s mansion on the Palatine Hill burned down. While sketching one of Alexander the Great&#x27;s concubines, Campaspe, Apelles fell in love with her. As a mark of appreciation for the great painter&#x27;s work, Alexander presented her to him. Apelles is said to have been working on a painting of Aphrodite of Kos when he died, and the painting was left unfinished for no one could be found with skill enough to complete it.

The renowned work of Apelles provided several exemplars for the narrative realism admired by Greco-Roman connoisseurs, succinctly expressed in Horace&#x27;s words &quot;ut pictura poesis&quot;, &quot;as is painting so is poetry.&quot; Apelles seemed to have had a taste for elaborate allegory and personification, which he carried far in his rendering of Calumny, described by Lucian, in which an innocent youth is falsely accused by Ignorance, Envy, Treachery and Deceit. The story occasioning the painting was alleged to have been false accusations by a rival artist that Apelles took part in a conspiracy against Ptolemy IV Philopator. This almost led to the artist&#x27;s execution. &quot;In the Renaissance the exemplar of the poetic painting which was invariably cited whenever the art-poetry question was discussed was the &quot;Calumny of Apelles&quot;, known through Lucian&#x27;s description.&quot; Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s panel of &quot;Calumny of Apelles&quot; was painted in conscious striving to equal the painting in Lucian&#x27;s &quot;ekphrasis&quot;.

The Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus used Apelles in an analogy for how ataraxia (i.e., freedom from mental perturbance) is achieved. The acquisition of ataraxia was likened to the process where Apelles was trying to paint a horse. He wished to represent its foam (in Greek mythology, Poseidon created horses out of sea foam). He was so unsuccessful that, in a rage, he gave up and threw the sponge he was using to clean his brushes with at the medium, and its mark produced the effect of the horse&#x27;s foam.

== Works ==
Apelles&#x27; paintings (none of which survive) included:
* &quot;Alexander wielding a thunderbolt&quot;, one of the many he did of both Alexander and his father Philip;
* &quot;Aphrodite Anadyomene&quot; (&quot;Aphrodite Rising from the Sea&quot;), showing the goddess rising from the sea (not the painting he was working on when he died, but an earlier painting), for which Pliny the Elder relates the tradition he used a former mistress of Alexander, Campaspe, as his model for Aphrodite. According to Athenaeus, the idea of &quot;Aphrodite Rising from the Sea&quot; was inspired by Phryne who during the time of the festivals of the Eleusinia and Poseidonia had no problem swimming nude in the sea.
* A portrait of Antigonus I Monophthalmus on horseback, in a three-quarters view which artfully concealed the subject&#x27;s blind eye;
* A portrait of Artemis surrounded by a group of maidens offering a sacrifice, based on &quot;Odyssey&quot; 6.102ff;
* &quot;Sacrifice in Cos&quot;, described in the &quot;Mimes&quot; (4.59) of Herodas.
* The portraits of Clitus the Black and Archelaus I of Macedon.
* The procession of the high priest of Artemis at Ephesus.
* The great allegory of &quot;Calumny&quot;.

A number of his paintings were taken to Rome (including &quot;Aphrodite Anadyomene&quot;) and placed there on public display; in two compositions featuring portraits of Alexander (&quot;Castor and Pollux with Victory and Alexander the Great&quot;, and &quot;The Figure of War with his Hands Tied Behind Him Following the Triumphal Chariot of Alexander&quot;) the Emperor Claudius later had Alexander&#x27;s face replaced with that of his grandfather Augustus.

== Legacy ==

An assessment by the classical scholar Percy Gardner in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition reads:

Pliny connects a number of sayings to Apelles, which may come from Apelles&#x27; lost treatise on the art of painting. One comes from Apelles&#x27; judgement on Protogenes, that Protogenes knew when his painting was finished: &quot;quod manum de tabula scirat&quot;—&quot;[He knew] when to take the hand from the picture.&quot; Another refers to his practice of exhibiting his works in the front of his shop, then hiding nearby to hear the comments of passers-by. When a cobbler commented on his mistakes in painting a shoe, Apelles made the corrections that very night; the next morning the cobbler noticed the changes, and proud of his effect on the artist&#x27;s work began to criticize how Apelles portrayed the leg—whereupon Apelles emerged from his hiding-place to state: &quot;Ne sutor ultra crepidam&quot;—&quot;Let the shoemaker venture no further than the shoe.&quot; The last saying Pliny attributes to Apelles refers to the painter&#x27;s diligence at practising his art every day: &quot;Nulla dies sine linea&quot;—&quot;Not a day without a line drawn.&quot; Apelles was also reportedly asked why he touched and retouched his paintings so continually, trying to achieve perfection (at least in his own mind); to which he replied, &quot;I paint for eternity.&quot; 

Pliny states that Apelles made a number of useful innovations to the art of painting, but his recipe for a black varnish, called by Pliny &quot;atramentum&quot;—which served both to preserve his paintings and to soften their colour, and created an effect that Pliny praises to no end—Apelles kept secret and was lost with his death.

There can be little doubt that Apelles was one of the most bold and progressive of artists. Such was his fame that several Italian Renaissance painters repeated his subjects, in a vain hope of giving some notion of the composition of them. Raphael may have portrayed himself as Apelles in &quot;The School of Athens&quot; and Sandro Botticelli based two paintings—&quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; and &quot;Calumny of Apelles&quot;—on his works. The 15th-century mathematician Luca Pacioli, when praising Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s work in Milan, including his Last Supper, stated that even Apelles must now give way to Leonardo as history&#x27;s greatest artist.
In 1819, the painting Générosité d&#x27;Alexandre, by Jérôme-Martin Langlois depicted the story of Alexander the Great gifting his concubine, Campaspe to Apelles.

<text>Santos Futebol Clube () is a Brazilian sports club based in Vila Belmiro, a &quot;bairro&quot; in the city of Santos. It plays in the Campeonato Paulista, the state of São Paulo&#x27;s premier state league, as well as the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the top flight of the Brazilian football league system, after winning the 2024 Série B title.

The club was founded in 1912 by three sports enthusiasts from Santos: Raimundo Marques, Mário Ferraz de Campos, and Argemiro de Souza Júnior. The initiative was a response to the lack of representation the city had in football. Since then, Santos has become one of Brazil&#x27;s most successful clubs, becoming a symbol of &quot;Joga Bonito&quot; (English: The Beautiful Game) in football culture, hence the motto &quot;Técnica e Disciplina&quot; (technique and discipline). This was largely thanks to the club&#x27;s golden generation of the 1960s, with players like Gilmar, Mauro Ramos, Mengálvio, Coutinho, Pepe, and most notable of all, Pelé, named the &quot;Athlete of the Century&quot; by the International Olympic Committee, and widely regarded as the best and most accomplished footballer in the game&#x27;s history. &quot;Os Santásticos&quot;, considered by some the best club team of all times, won a total of 24 titles during that decade including five consecutive league titles, a feat that remains unequaled today. &quot;Os Santásticos&quot; won four competitions in 1962, thus completing a quadruple, comprising the Campeonato Paulista, the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the Copa Libertadores, and the European/South American Cup.

Santos Futebol Clube is one of the most successful clubs in the &quot;Brasileirão&quot;, becoming national champions on eight occasions. It has also won 22 &quot;Paulistão&quot; titles, three Copa Libertadores, two Intercontinental Cups, one Supercopa de Campeones Intercontinentales, one Copa CONMEBOL (the precursor of current Copa Sudamericana), one Copa do Brasil, and one Recopa Sudamericana. On 20 January 1998, Santos became the first team, in any category in the world, to reach the milestone of 10,000 goals in the entire history of football and was voted by FIFA as one of the most successful clubs of the 20th century. Santos also holds a record as the club with the most goals in football history.

The team plays their home games at the Vila Belmiro, which currently holds up to 20,120 spectators. Santos&#x27; regular kit is white shirts, with white shorts, accompanied by white socks. Santos is nicknamed the Peixe (; &quot;fish&quot;), in reference to significance of the city&#x27;s port. The most recognized Santista anthem is the &quot;Leão do Mar&quot; written by Mangeri Neto. In 2013, the club is the 2nd most valuable club in Brazil and South America, and 38th most valuable club in the world according to Brand Finance, worth over $65 million. In terms of revenue, Santos is Brazil&#x27;s fourth-richest sports club and one of the biggest football clubs in the world, generating an annual turnover of over $114 million in 2012. Santos has many long-standing rivalries, most notably against Corinthians, Palmeiras, and São Paulo.

==History==
===Birth of Santos FC: 1912===
In the beginning of the 20th century, the city of Santos grew to become of great importance to Brazil. Its port became one of the largest in the world with coffee, a major product in those times, being the most exported product. With the influx of income, the wealthy socialites of the city became increasingly interested in having the city represented in sports. Being a port, water sports such as rowing were generally the most practiced activity by the city&#x27;s youth, but the city had teams strong enough to compete in the Campeonatos Paulista or &quot;Paulistão&quot;, with Clube Atlético Internacional and Sport Club Americano being the two strongest representatives. Football was introduced to Santos in 1902 via the &quot;Instituto Presbiteriano Mackenzie&quot;, and the students created the two aforementioned clubs as a result.

However, Atlético Internacional dissolved in 1910 and Americano moved to São Paulo in 1911. With the city students dissatisfied at this turn of events, a meeting was held at the headquarters of the Concordia Club (located in Rosario Street No. 18, at the top of the old bakery and Switzerland confectionery, currently Avenida João Pessoa), with the aim of creating a football team. The conference, which lasted 14 hours, was spearheaded by three sportsmen from the city: Raymundo Marques Francisco, Mário Ferraz de Campos and Argemiro de Souza Junior. During the meeting, there was doubt as to the name that should be given to the club. Several suggestions emerged: África Futebol Clube, Associação Esportiva Brasil, Concórdia Futebol Clube, among others. But the participants unanimously approved the proposal of Edmundo Jorge de Araujo: Santos Foot-Ball Club. Thus, the club was formally born on 14 April 1912, hours before the RMS Titanic sank into the Atlantic Ocean. As is commonly said, &quot; One Giant sank into the ocean, and on the same day Another One was born&quot;. The club&#x27;s first president was Sizino Patuska (who had participated in the founding of Atlético Internacional and was the founder of Americano).

===Early years: 1912–1935===

The club&#x27;s first practice match took place on 23 June 1912 at the Villa Macuco field, against a local club called Thereza. Santos won 2–1. The first &quot;Santista&quot; goal was scored by Anacleto Ferramenta da Silva, with Geraule Moreira Ribeiro adding another one later on. The first official match took place on 15 September of that same year, beating Santos Athletic Club 3–2. Arnaldo Silveira, one of the original founders of Santos, scored the first official goal of the club. The &quot;Alvinegro Praiano&quot; took part in their first Campeonato Paulista in 1913, being thrashed 8–2 by Germânia on 1 June. Although Santos earned their first victory against Corinthians, a 3–6 away win at the Parque Antárctica (now known as the Estádio Palestra Itália), the 5–1 and 6–1 thumpings that Santos suffered at the hands of SC Internacional and Americano, respectively, and the high cost of travel, forced the team to abandon the tournament and make much needed improvements.

However, in 1913 the Campeonato Santista was first played, with the &quot;Alvinegro&quot; earning their first ever title after winning all six matches, scoring 35 goals and conceding only seven. In 1914, due to an internal financial crisis, Santos only played friendly matches, winning all seven of them. In 1915, Santos changed their name temporarily to União Futebol Clube in order to compete in another city tournament due to budgeting reasons. Even so, Santos still went on to earn another title, their second in three years. With economic stability on hand, the Vila Belmiro sports park was inaugurated on 12 October 1916. That same year, Santos returned to compete in another Campeonato Paulista finishing in a much-improved 5th place.
Between the 1917 and 1926 seasons, Santos was recognized as a solid and talented team, but one that could not offer a true challenge for the state title, finishing no higher than fourth place. That changed in 1927 when the tradition of the &quot;Alvinegro&quot; became defined during the 1920s: the discovery and creation of young talent. The team, known as &quot;O ataque dos 100 gols&quot; (English: The 100-goal attackers), was led by the first major club idol, Araken Patusca, son of the first president of Santos. With the Araken Patusca was the first &quot;Santista&quot; to participate in a World Cup, as a member of the Brazilian national team in the FIFA World Cup in 1930, the first World Cup. He played one match against Yugoslavia. Santos finished as runners-up in 1927, 1928 and 1929, scoring 100 goals in 16 games in the 1927 season, resulting in an incredible rate of 6.25 goals per match. The milestone of 100 goals was a result of work characteristics that later would become an excerpt in the official anthem of the club: &quot;Técnica e Disciplina&quot; (English: Technique and Discipline). Santos entered a period of irregular campaigns, coinciding with the club&#x27;s transition to professionalism; in 1933 the president of Santos publicly declared Santos a professional side for the first time. 
This was followed by the club&#x27;s first great success in 1935. During that season, the club prepared heavily for the &quot;Paulistão&quot; with 14 friendlies, winning seven, losing four and drawing three matches. The 10–1 thrashing of Espanha at the hands of Santos provided the highlight of its preseason preparations. On the last match of the state competition, Santos defeated Corinthians 2–0 at the Estádio Parque São Jorge, Corinthians&#x27; home ground at the time, to win their first state title ever, thanks to goals by Raul and an experienced Araken Patusca. This historic consecration sealed Santos&#x27; first major title and paved the way for future generations to follow.

Although Santos failed to retain the state title next season, the club remained undefeated in international matches during the 1930s, with seven wins and one draw. The most overwhelming win occurred against the France national football team, who arrived at Santos on 30 July after the FIFA World Cup in Uruguay and decided to use the stop to play against a local team, handidly losing 6–1 with four goals from Feitiço. Claiming they faced the &quot;Seleção&quot; rather than the club, the suspicious French were invited to the clubhouse to prove that the team that had just faced them was not the Brazilian team in disguise.

===The road towards the second &quot;Paulistão&quot;: 1936–1955===
Following their triumph in the 1935 &quot;Paulistão&quot;, many key players of the winning squad left or retired soon afterwards, depleting the club of its veterans. Santos would finish in 4th place in their failed attempt to defend the state title in 1936. Patusca&#x27;s departure in 1937 proved to be the closing chapter of his generation and the beginning of dismal campaigns in the Paulista tournament for the following 10 years, finishing no higher than 5th place.

However, Santos&#x27; fortunes changed when former goalkeeper Athié Jorge Cury became club president in 1946 and immediately sought out to reconquer the state title. After getting the club&#x27;s finances in order, he sanctioned a tour into the Brazilian northern and northeastern regions to face the top teams in Belém, Fortaleza, Natal and Recife, among other cities, and give the upcoming generation much needed experience. Santos soundly defeated many of the regions&#x27; top clubs such as Paysandu, Fortaleza EC, ABC, Santa Cruz, etc. Led by the club&#x27;s second chronological idol Antoninho, the club went on undefeated in what was, until then, the longest football trip any Brazilian club has taken. It lasted from 29 November 1946 to 2 February 1947 with Santos obtaining 12 wins and three draws. The leading goal-scorers of the tour were Caxambu, with 19 goals, and Adolfrise, scoring 18.

The club managed to finish in 2nd place in the 1948 edition of the &quot;Paulistão&quot;, thanks to Antoninho, Pinho and Odair dos Santos. Odair become the club&#x27;s season topscorer with 20 goals; he will repeat this feat for the following three seasons. Odair and Antoninho would also help the club finish 3rd in the 1950 edition of the state competition. This was the first time Santos had two top-three finishes in three seasons in the &quot;Paulistão&quot; since the &quot;O ataque dos 100 gols&quot; generation. Santos also participated in the Torneio Rio – São Paulo for the first time in 1952, finishing in third place overall. The arrivals of younger prospects such as Formiga, Manga, Tite, Zito and Vasconcelos coincided with the retirements of Odair and Antoninho in 1952 and 1953 respectively, ensuring the club had the quality to maintain its pursuit on the State championship. Antoninho would become the club&#x27;s assistant manager in 1954 with Lula becoming the club&#x27;s manager that same year.
It was in 1955 when Santos finished building its base and establishments that would make it a success in the future. Despite starting that year&#x27;s &quot;Paulistão&quot; with a mediocre 0–0 draw against Noroeste, the club would go on to remain undefeated for the first 11 matches in the competition which included a 7–1 victory over Jabaquara, the heaviest defeat they would inflict in that competition&#x27;s edition. A 4–2 defeat to Guarani and an 8–0 drumming by Portuguesa brought setbacks and instability. A 3–1 loss to São Paulo and consecutive losses to São Bento and Corinthians put the club&#x27;s aspirations to the state title in danger. However, the club&#x27;s strong team spirit, the goals of Emanuele Del Vecchio, its relatively stable campaign and the 2–1 victory over Taubaté, Santos&#x27; last match in the competition, ensured the club would win their second state title ever, the first in 20 years. Del Vecchio&#x27;s 38 goals were the club&#x27;s highest season tally since Patusca&#x27;s 53 in 1927. He was also the &quot;Paulistãos&quot;&#x27; top scorer with 23 goals. An infamous club anthem, &quot;Leão do Mar&quot;, was created in order to commemorate this triumph.

In order to build upon the moment and provide a capable defense of the state title, Cury set in motion a series of plans and contracts after predicting that several of its veterans might opt to leave the club in a repeat of the aftermath in 1935. He secured the services of several established players such as Zito. Cury also invested to keep several young potentials like Pepe and the upcoming Pagão. The club president also gave Lula leeway to scout talented individuals who were trying out for the club. Perhaps the greatest signing Cury approved of was that of a 15-year-old boy brought over to Vila Belmiro by Waldemar de Brito. De Brito, who was a manager of Bauru Atlético Clube&#x27;s junior squad, won three consecutive São Paulo state youth championships between 1954 and 1956 with the child. The boy, called Edson Arantes do Nascimento and who would be better known as &quot;Pelé&quot; in the near future, was the main driving force behind those victories. The contract between Santos and the young Pelé was finalized in June 1956.

===Golden Era - &quot;Os Santásticos&quot;: 1956–1974===
====The first Continental Treble in the world and the &quot;Pentacampeonato&quot;====
After 50 years Santos began to be seen as the best team in the world. When Pelé made his debut in the Campeonato Paulista in 1957, the team was already twice state champion (1955/56). Pelé had as fellow players Zito, Pagão, Formiga, Hélvio, Jair da Rosa Pinto, Urubatão, Tite and Pepe. Santos won the third state title in 50 years, the magical year of 1958 – in which Brazil won the World Cup in Sweden, with Zito Santos, Pelé and Pepe, and won in spectacular fashion. Santos scored 143 goals in 38 games, averaging 3.76 per game, and conceded only 40 goals. Pelé set a record that has never been equaled in any state competition in the country: he scored no less than 58 goals. Santos&#x27; traditional rivals were heavily beaten in 1958, particularly a 10–0 win against the Nacional. In addition to state titles, Santos won the Rio-São Paulo in 1959, beating Vasco in the final by 3–0 with two goals by Coutinho, who was only 16 years old. Coutinho also scored five goals against Ponte Preta, and Santos won the game by 12–1 even without Pelé.
No other team had a dominance in Brazilian football as great as Santos in the 1960s. The club won eight titles: six Brazilian Championships (five Taça Brasil and one Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa), two Copas Libertadores, two Intercontinental Cups, three Rio-São Paulo, a South American Recopa, a World and numerous international tournaments.
A poll in the magazine El Gráfico saw dozens of experts from South America and Europe choose the Santos side of 1962/63 as the best team of all time.

====Reprioritization, Rejuvenation and Renaissance of the &quot;Globetrotters&quot;====
In demand worldwide, Santos became the first globetrotting football team and played exhibition matches in dozens of countries. A war in Africa was stopped so that the two sides could see Pelé&#x27;s team play. Under pressure from the CBD (Brazilian Sport Confederation), which the team did not want to risk their star players in unsafe stadiums in South America, Santos did not participate in the editions of the Libertadores 1966, 1967 and 1969.
Players from Santos and Botafogo formed the basis of the Brazilian World Cup sides in Chile (1962) and Mexico (1970). On two occasions – against Germany and England – the national team had eight Santos players in the team. In six games of qualifying for the 1970 World Cup &quot;The beasts of the Saldanha&quot; played with six Santos players : Carlos Alberto, Djalma Dias, Joel Camargo, Rildo, Pelé and Edu. The influence of Santos was so great that the defense played with the national team the same numbers that were used at Santos: right-back with the shirt 4, right center-back with the second, left center-back with the sixth and left-back with three.
Finally, left-winger Antônio Simões, Benfica and Portugal said: &quot;I compare the Santos 62 team with the national team of Brazil in 70. These are the two best football teams I have ever seen. The 70 side is the confirmation of a game model that Santos already demonstrated long ago.&quot;

==== Epilogue: &quot;Os Santásticos&quot;&#x27; legacy ====
Santos was champion in 1973, still with Pelé in the team, and again in 1978, driven by the amazing &quot;Meninos da Vila&quot;, Pita, Juary, João Paulo and Nilton Batata, the Santos of the 1970s were no longer just appreciated for the refinement of their football and became a symbol of passion and rapture. Their fans, who for a long time could not compete with the teams of the capital, steadily grew in number and started to compete with the massive Morumbi crowd, and significantly passed São Paulo and Palmeiras.

===Intermittency: 1974–1994===
When it seemed that the fate of the club would be hopelessly compromised by debt made millions for the purchase of the luxurious Spa Park, Santos came back to be only eleven shirts who fought and drew crowds. In one of the worst moments of its history, which resulted in the loss of the Spa Park and all that was invested in him, Santos rose a charismatic worship, which had its greatest asset in his legions of fans.

The period began with Santos becoming the vice-champion of the São Paulo state championship of 1980, and the executioner of this final Santos – São Paulo fan striker Serginho – is who would become the idol of the decade Santos.
Passionate team Belmiro since childhood, the irascible Sérgio Bernardino only felt at home when he was hired by President Milton Teixeira to the team that would compete in the 1993 Brazilian Championship. Opportunist, kicking strong and big stamina, Serginho was the terror of the defenses that the Brazilian Championship and became the top scorer with 22 goals. The team took the runner-up slot, to win in São Paulo, Rio lose and be overtaken on goal for Flamengo.
The following year the team became São Paulo state champions in a rally-point competition, ending Corinthians&#x27; dream of reaching the championship for the third straight year. In the decisive game of ecstasy to Santos, the team defeated Corinthians 1–0 with a Serginho goal in the second half. Santos&#x27; striker was again the top scorer, this time tied with Chiquinho of Botafogo, with 16 goals.

===The 90s and little success: 1995–2002===

In the 1990s Santos won only two tiles: the Rio – São Paulo Tournament in 1997 and the Copa CONMEBOL in 1998. In the final of the national Championship of 1995, Santos faced Botafogo, but could not beat the team from Rio de Janeiro.

The new chairman Marcelo Teixeira, son of former chairman Milton Teixeira, tried to prepare Santos for domination in the 21st century. No expense was spared to build a complete squad, with names as Freddy Rincón, Marcelinho Carioca, Edmundo, Márcio Santos, Carlos Germano, Valdo and Carlos Galván. Those big names could not translate their reputation into excellence on the pitch, resulting in a runner-up and a semi-final loss in the state championships of 2000 and 2001. In the national league Santos performed sub-par, with an 18th place in 2000 and a 15th in 2001.

===The renewed &quot;Peixe&quot;: 2002–2008===
In 2002, after being in a severe financial crisis, Santos let go of high-profile players and focused at their youth squads for reinforcements, aiming to avoid relegation. Bringing in low cost players like André Luís (loan return from Fluminense), Maurinho (Etti-Jundiaí), Júlio Sérgio (Comercial-SP), Alberto (Rio Branco), and promoting Alex, Robinho and Diego from the youth setup, all of those seven players would become starters under new head coach Emerson Leão, along Elano, Paulo Almeida, Léo and Renato.

In a more than reasonable campaign Santos finished eighth in the regular season and thus qualified for the play-offs. Eliminating São Paulo (and its young duo Kaká and Luís Fabiano) in the quarter-finals, the club faced Grêmio in the semi-finals. After a 3–0 victory at the Vila Belmiro, they went through the final even after a 0–1 away loss.

With Robinho and Diego as the most important of Meninos da Vila, Corinthians was beaten in both of the final legs and thus Santos conquered its seventh national championship. The &quot;pedalada&quot;, one of the most disseminated tricks nowadays, was popularized by Robinho in the final match.

In 2003, Santos finished in second position in the first ever Brazilian national championship without a post-season play-off to determine the champion. The next year, however Santos returned to glory. In a year where fans felt their team was being intentionally hampered by referees, lost the right to play in its own stadium on various occasions and the kidnapping of Robinho&#x27;s mother, Santos had an impressive campaign. Only two matches before the end of the competition, Santos was able to surpass Atlético Paranaense, who had been on top of the table for the majority of the season. In the last match Santos did not crumble and beat Vasco da Gama 2–1 for its eighth title.

With Robinho, Léo, Deivid and manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo leaving Santos in 2005, the team was unable to win more titles that year. Despite leading figures leaving, Santos was headed for a sixth-place finish until the &quot;Zveitão&quot;. Upon discovery that referee Edilson Pereira de Carvalho participated in manipulating results, all matches he led were played over again. Santos&#x27; 4–2 win against Corinthians thus became a 2–3 loss, which meant Santos dropped to the 11th place and gave its rival, Corinthians, the championship at cost of Internacional.

In 2006, Santos was fourth in Brazil, securing itself a spot in the Copa Libertadores, and won the Paulista Championship for the first time since 1984. In 2007 Santos lost its first match only in the first leg of the final yet winning the title through a second leg victory nonetheless. In the national championship Santos led the team to second place, 15 points behind champion São Paulo.

With again various big names leaving, 2008 proved to be a troublesome year for Santos. Only thanks to a comeback in the last few games was relegation avoided. In 2008 Santos played Copa Libertadores again. They endured until quarter-finals, when they were beaten by America (Mexico).

===The Second Santástico: 2009–2013===
With a recurrence of financial problems, Santos recruited young players. In 2009, Neymar and Paulo Henrique Ganso joined the professional team; Neymar signed with the team when he was 13, while Ganso came from Paysandu, a northern team, when he was 15. They started to play together and developed a very strong bond. In 2010, they led a great team, which is the base of the actual squad. The team that won Campeonato Paulista this year was formed by: Felipe; Pará, Edu Dracena, Durval and Léo; Wesley, Arouca and Ganso; Neymar, André, and the repatriated Robinho. They also won Copa do Brasil 2010, beating Vitória in the finals, but with an overwhelming campaign. For example, they beat Naviraiense 10–0, which gave them the status of Santástico (Santos + Fantastic) again. This team is also known for the irreverent game style and the dancing celebrations.
2011 was also a good year for the club. It raised its revenue with marketing and rights, mainly because of Neymar&#x27;s success. Santos traded away some players from the previous year&#x27;s team, but maintained some of the main players. Also, some other named players came from Europe to Peixe&#x27;s squad, like Elano, Alan Kardec and Ibson. This year Santos won the Campeonato Paulista, beating two of its biggest rivals, São Paulo and Corinthians. The main team was formed by: Rafael Cabral; Danilo, Edu Dracena, Durval, Léo; Arouca, Adriano, Elano, Ganso; Neymar and Borges. This team also won the Copa Libertadores, beating Peñarol (Uruguay) in the finals. In December, Santos traveled to Japan and finished in the second position in the FIFA Club World Cup, beaten by Barcelona.

In 2012, Santos kept the two title per year ratio, winning the State Championships (Paulistão) against Guarani and the Recopa against Universidad de Chile. The team started to fragment, and saw the departures of Ganso (São Paulo), Borges (Cruzeiro), Elano (Grêmio) and other key players.

2013 marked the end of the latest Santástico era. Without achieving the fourth Paulistão in a row (runner-up), the eventual negotiations and departure of Neymar (negotiated with Barcelona), the coach Muricy Ramalho and the goalkeeper Rafael Cabral (Napoli) ended up leaving Santos as a shadow of its latest victorious installment. Santos ended the 2013 season in seventh place and had the best finish of any team from the state of São Paulo. At the end of the season, interim manager Claudinei Oliveira was let go of by the club on mutual terms and Santos hired Oswaldo de Oliveira to begin in 2014.

===Financial problems and mid-table campaigns: 2014–2020===
In 2014, Santos began the year competing in the Paulistão and completing several signings, including the most expensive player ever bought by Santos, Leandro Damião. On 1 February, Gabriel (another player who came through the youth setup) scored Santos&#x27; 12,000th goal in a 5–1 routing over Botafogo-SP. Despite playing an enthusiastic football during the tournament (also being the most effective attack), Santos was defeated in the final round by fourth division side Ituano on penalty kicks, eventually finishing runner-up. On 2 September 2014, Oswaldo de Oliveira was released by the Santos board and replaced the next day by Enderson Moreira.

Santos finished 9th in the year&#x27;s Brasileirão, and on 13 December 2014, Modesto Roma Júnior was elected the new president, after winning by 1,329 votes. The club also suffered with several financial troubles from the previous management, led by Odílio Rodrigues, and saw Damião, Arouca, Aranha and Eugenio Mena take legal actions against the club due to unpaid wages.

In 2015, due to the club&#x27;s financial problems, free agents Elano and Ricardo Oliveira returned to Santos with a low wage, and the club also loaned out Damião (the most expensive player of the previous campaign). On 5 March, despite the club&#x27;s unbeaten status, Enderson Moreira was sacked.

Marcelo Fernandes was appointed manager shortly after, winning the year&#x27;s &quot;Paulistão&quot;. After a poor start in the &quot;Brasileirão&quot;, Dorival Júnior returned to the club after five years, taking it to the finals of 2015 Copa do Brasil and returning to &quot;G-4&quot; after more than 130 rounds.

Dorival remained in charge of the club for the 2016 campaign, winning the year&#x27;s &quot;Paulistão&quot; (22nd) and achieving a first place in &quot;Brasileirão&quot; for one week after eight years. During the 2017 campaign, the club sacked Dorival and subsequently appointed Levir Culpi; however, after the club&#x27;s elimination of the Copa Libertadores and due to poor form, Levir was himself dismissed.

On 9 December 2017, José Carlos Peres was elected as the new president. The first manager of his tenure was Jair Ventura, who left the club in July 2018 after being in the relegation zone; Cuca (who already worked at the team in 2008) later took over and led the club to a 10th position.
For the 2019 season, Santos hired widely known manager Jorge Sampaoli to take over the first team, and he led the club to a second position in the league; in the cups and in the state league, however, the club failed to repeat the same success after being knocked out in the first round of the Copa Sudamericana, in the round of 16 in the Copa do Brasil and in the semifinals of the &quot;Paulistão&quot;.

Sampaoli later resigned, and Jesualdo Ferreira was signed on his place for the 2020 campaign. Jesualdo was sacked in August, with the team having the worst campaign of a Série A side in the year&#x27;s &quot;Paulistão&quot;, and Cuca returned to the club after being named manager in his place. Shortly after, president José Carlos Peres was removed from his role, and vice-president Orlando Rollo (who was also out from the club for more than a year after having public altercations with Peres) took over in an interim manner.

Santos also suffered various bans from FIFA during the 2020 season, after failing to pay the debts of Cléber Reis, Yeferson Soteldo and Felipe Aguilar. These bans led to debuts of several youth prospects in the first team, the most notable being Ângelo with just 15 years of age. On 12 December 2020, Andrés Rueda was elected as president of the club for the 2021–2023 three-year term, in which was the first online voting of the club&#x27;s history.

===Downfall and relegation to Série B: 2021–2024===
In January 2021, Santos reached the Final of the 2020 Copa Libertadores, but lost to local rivals Palmeiras after a goal in the stoppage time. In the following month, Cuca announced his departure from the club, and Argentine Ariel Holan was hired on his place for the 2021 campaign.

Holan resigned in April 2021, after a poor campaign in the Campeonato Paulista, and Fernando Diniz was appointed manager in May; he was himself dismissed in September, as the club was threatened with relegation in the Série A, and Fábio Carille finished the season as manager, leading the club to a 10th place. Carille was sacked in February 2022, with Argentine manager Fabián Bustos being appointed in his place.

Following a 2–1 home defeat against Fortaleza on the final matchday of the 2023 season, Santos finished 17th to be relegated to the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B for the first time in their 111-year history. On 9 December 2023, Marcelo Teixeira was elected the new president, returning to the role after 14 years.

For the 2024 season, the club&#x27;s first-ever in the second division, Carille returned as head coach and led the side to the 2024 Campeonato Paulista finals. The club also won the Série B title with two rounds to go, but Carille was sacked on 18 November, before the campaign&#x27;s final match.

===Back to Série A and Neymar&#x27;s return: 2025–present===
Ahead of the 2025 season, Pedro Caixinha was hired as the club&#x27;s new head coach. On 31 January of that year, the club announced the return of Neymar on a five-month contract.

==Crest and colors==
The first colors chosen for the new club were white, azure blue and golden lemon as an homage to Concórdia Club. But the difficulty to fabricate the colors on the uniform during those times forced a board meeting a year after the club&#x27;s foundation. Pelúcio Paul suggested switching the official colors to white and black. According to Paul, the color white represents peace and black represents nobility. It received wide approval from the club members and the president of Santos, Raymundo Marques, based the club on the new colors.

Since the club&#x27;s foundation, Santos have had eight main crests, though all underwent minor variations. In 1912, Santos adopted a black and white striped shield, with one of the early leather footballs in the middle and a diagonal band with the letters &quot;SFBC&quot;. In order to pay homage to Concórdia Club (who let Santos use their headquarters to plan its foundation), the club used a crest that incorporated three golden lemon letters, the letters S, F and C, in the center of an azure blue circle. At the end of 1912, the crest was remade with a white band around the circle. The white band was surrounded by a golden lemon border. The letters were colored white with golden lemon serving as its outside borders. Due to the difficulty of creating these colors consistently, the crest was rebranded to a white badge with black borders and the letters &#x27;SFC&#x27; colored black.

Later in 1913, the crest was redesigned as a badge inside a globe showing longitude and latitude lines as well as the equator. The badge had a black, diagonal band with &quot;S.F.C.&quot; in white text. The top half above the band was white with a leather ball at the top left corner. The bottom half was a black and white striped background. Above the badge was a crown. During 1915, the club temporarily changed its name to União Futebol Clube and were forced to create a temporary crest for that year. The crest was an escutcheon with a white band that read &#x27;União F.C.&#x27; and a black background. In 1925, the globe and crown were removed from the crest and it took its future form, only going through a remodelling in 2005.

On December 27, 2022, the club added a crown to the crest in honor of Pelé (who would later pass away two days after), the honor is positioned above the crest, between the two stars referring to the Intercontinental Cup titles in 1962 and 1963. The honor was proposed in the new statute, which was approved in November. Article 103 of the text says that &quot;Santos will use in professional, amateur and futsal football games, both in the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s categories, in all of its shirts, a crown over the existing stars of world titles, by way of permanent homage to Edson Arantes do Nascimento, &quot;O Rei&quot; Pelé&quot;.

==Sponsorship==
Since 1979, Santos has had 38 different sponsors, with Rainha being the club&#x27;s first kit manufacturer. Casas Bahia, a Brazilian retail chain which specializes in furniture and home appliances, became the first sponsor for the &quot;Peixe&quot;. The club is currently primarily sponsored by kit manufacturers Umbro.

The team has also many sponsors that invest in the club as well. The current sponsors are Caixa (a Brazilian bank), Brahma (the second best-selling beer in Brazil), Semp and Algar Telecom (a Brazilian telecommunications company).

==Stadiums==
Soon after its foundation, Santos held their training in a field located in the district of Macuco. As the pitch did not meet the minimum size standards to host official matches, Santos played on the &quot;Igreja Coração de Maria&quot; pitch in Ana Costa Avenue. The field, however, was also used by other clubs in town. In 1915, the situation reached its breaking point, when Santos had constant conflicts with other city clubs on when the field could be used, forcing the club to reject several requests for international friendlies. To solve the problem, the leaders began searching for land in the city. On 31 May 1916, a general assembly approved the purchase of an area of 16,500 square meters, in the neighborhood of Vila Belmiro. On 12 October of that year, the inauguration of the &quot;Vila Belmiro&quot; sports park. The first game was held 10 days later, against Ypiranga for the 1916 Campeonato Paulista which Santos won 2–1. Adolpho Millon Jr. scored the first ever goal on that stadium.

The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 32,989 in a 0–0 draw between Santos and Corinthians for the 1964 Campeonato Paulista. Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations. The last change was a new illumination system being installed on 27 January 1998, with an illumnination level of 1200 lux, more than the FIFA minimum recommendation. The Vila Belmiro was one of the venues of the 1949 Copa América, hosted the 1962 Copa Libertadores final and the 1998 Copa CONMEBOL final. It has also hosted a Copa do Brasil final in 2010. Due to its relative-low capacity, Santos has used other stadiums for high-profile matches such as the Estádio Palestra Itália, Pacaembu and Morumbi, all located in São Paulo, and the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro. Current Santos President Luis Alvaro Ribeiro and other club directors are agreeing on building a stadium in a city nearby Santos called Cubatao, a stadium for 40,000 people which would become Santos&#x27; home field for almost 70% of the games during the season which would increase the team&#x27;s profit.

In October 2005, the Centro de Treinamento Rei Pelé was inaugurated. Located in the Jabaquara neighborhood, the training ground, one of the most modern in Brazil, includes medical and training facilities for the first team and a hotel, Recanto dos Alvinegros.

The &quot;Centro de Treinamento Meninos da Vila&quot;, located in the Saboó neighborhood, constitutes two fields of equal size to the &quot;Vila Belmiro&quot; and it is intended for the training and development of players. The two fields are named in homage to the revelation of players Diego and Robinho. It was inaugurated in August 2006.

==Brand==
The core strength of Santos&#x27;s global brand is often attributed to Lula&#x27;s success in leading &quot;Os Santasticos&quot;, which drew worldwide acclaim. The iconic team included Gilmar, Mauro, Mengálvio, Coutinho, Pepe and Pelé. This attention often generates greater interest in off-the-field, with the popularity of the club and brand spanning five continents across the globe. Many domestic and international clubs were founded in homage to Santos. In Macapá, Santos Futebol Clube do Macapá was founded in 1973. In João Pessoa, Santos Futebol Clube do João Pessoa was founded in 1949. In Viana, Angola, Santos Futebol Clube de Angola was founded in 2002. In Porto Alegre, Santos Futebol Clube de Alegrete also took after its &quot;Paulista&quot; model. Santos F.C. from Providence, Guyana is another example of the popularity of the infamous brand of the club. Kingston&#x27;s Santos Football Club, four times national champions of Jamaica, pays tribute not only to the club, by using its name and crest, but also to the Brazilian national team by replacing the white color on the badge with yellow. The &quot;Santos FC Academy&quot; in Oak Park, California is a youth soccer academy in the United States that uses the club&#x27;s name in tribute. In Iwata, Japan, &quot;Santos FC Soccer Academy Japan&quot; has grown in popularity since ts creation in 1993, having categories from the ages of six to nineteen while the club expanded its brand to Cairo, Egypt in 2008. &quot;Santos FC&#x27;s Soccer Academy&quot; in Orlando, Florida is another one of the club&#x27;s international branches. In Hong Kong, Nene Leung created the group &quot;Nene &amp; The Santos Boys&quot;, a group of Chinese and Hong Kongers who dedicate themselves to watch Santos&#x27; matches.

Santos is one of Brazil&#x27;s most economically powerful and richest football clubs; it had an annual turnover of US$45.1m (€31.5m) in 2011 and became one of the most valuable clubs, worth over $86.7m (€60.6m). That same year, Santos&#x27; squad became the most valued in South America, being worth over €82m, surpassing every club in the Dutch &quot;Eredivisie&quot; and the English Football League Championship, most of the clubs in Portugal&#x27;s Primeira Liga, Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;Premyer-Liha&quot;, Turkey&#x27;s &quot;Süper Lig&quot;, Russia&#x27;s Premier League and France&#x27;s &quot;Ligue 1&quot;, as well as over half the clubs in Germany&#x27;s &quot;Bundesliga&quot;, Italy&#x27;s &quot;Serie A&quot;, Spain&#x27;s &quot;La Liga&quot; and England&#x27;s Premier League. Konami&#x27;s Pro Evolution Soccer, a secondary sponsor of the official Copa Libertadores video game, featured Santos in the video game Pro Evolution Soccer 2012. This is the first time that the club is being featured on a video game. The flamboyant, attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the physical-minded approach favoured by European, Uruguayan and Argentinian teams of the era) was a constant, worldwide exhibition that saw Santos travel in over 50 countries on every continent (except Antarctica). The club&#x27;s focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Santos&#x27; brand was bolstered by its FIFA World Cup winners, especially Pelé. Pelé is hailed as a national hero. He is known for his accomplishments and contributions to the game of football. He is also acknowledged for his vocal support of policies to improve the social conditions of the poor (when he scored his 1,000th goal with Santos he dedicated it to the poor children of Brazil). During his career, he became known as &quot;The King of Football&quot; (&quot;O Rei do Futebol&quot;), &quot;The King Pelé&quot; (&quot;O Rei Pelé&quot;) or simply &quot;The King&quot; (&quot;O Rei&quot;). In 2013, Santos signed Pelé to a contract agreeing to make him its global ambassador, extending it to a lifetime contract in 2014, and will continue to use his image in its marketing campaigns.

==Supporters==
Santos is one of the most popular clubs in Brazil. Santos has fans in all states of Brazil and fans in several different countries around the world. According to a survey conducted by the research firm Institute DataFolha in early 2006, Santos is the fourth most popular football club in Brazil. According to the results, Santos was preferred by 4% of the Brazilian population, which represents approximately 10 million fans in Brazil. It is estimated that Santos FC has nearly 20 million fans worldwide and admirers scattered throughout Africa, Europe, North America and Latin American countries.
There are also several Santos organized fan clubs of football factories, among them Torcida Jovem do Santos, Sangue Jovem, and Força Jovem Santos.
Santos is one of the clubs with the largest number of members in Brazil, currently has over 70,000 members.

==Rivalries==
As Santos have no close rival within its own city, historical rivalries have been with Corinthians, São Paulo, and Palmeiras, clubs from nearby São Paulo city. The derby between Santos and São Paulo is known as &quot;San–São&quot;, is one of the biggest Brazilian derbies because both teams are the biggest world champions and three times Copa Libertadores champions. The rivalry with Palmeiras is known as &quot;Clássico da Saudade&quot; (Nostalgia Derby) because in the 1960s, the two teams had great names in Brazilian football and were constant presences in championship decisions. The rivalry with Corinthians is known as &quot;Clássico Alvinegro&quot; (the Black and White Derby) because of the colors of both teams.

==Popular culture==
The club has been featured in several documentary and semi-documentary films such as &quot;Guadalajara 70,&quot; &quot;Uma história de futebol,&quot; &quot;Dogão calabresa,&quot; and &quot;Boleiros.&quot; Former players have also been published, most notably Pelé, but others have appeared in films such as &quot;Ginga.&quot; Santos was the featured club in the film &quot;Asa Branca: Um Sonho Brasileiro,&quot; a story of a modest but talented soccer player for Santos who reaches stardom. Pelé appeared, alongside other footballers of the 1960s and 1970s, with Michael Caine, and Sylvester Stallone, in the 1981 film &quot;Escape to Victory,&quot; about an attempted escape from a World War II German POW Camp. The club has become a symbol of &quot;O Jogo Bonito&quot; (English: The Beautiful Game) in football culture. This was largely thanks to the &quot;Peixe&#x27;s&quot; golden generation of the 1960s, the &quot;Santásticos,&quot; considered by some the best club team of all times.

The club has many local celebrities in its fan group, such as Brazilian singer Mariana Belém, current governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, current governor of Federal District (Brasília) Agnelo Queiroz, prosecutor Luiz Antônio Marrey, director, writer, actor and television hoster Marcelo Tas and Danielle Zangrando, gold and bronze judo medalist at the 2007 Pan American Games and 1995 World Judo Championships, respectively. Bob Marley, a famous Jamaican singer-songwriter and musician and the most widely known and revered performer of reggae music, played a practice match with Santos in 1980 along with the ska, rocksteady and reggae band Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers. Bob Marley even wore the Santos uniform.

The Brazilian classical composer Gilberto Mendes, who was born and lived in the city of Santos, wrote in 1969 an oeuvre called &quot;Santos Football Music,&quot; with audience interaction and a radio broadcast, previously recorded, of a sports commentator narrating a football game of Santos FC, all forming a cluster with the orchestra.

&quot;Santos 100 Anos de Futebol Arte&quot; was a film released in 2012, year of the centenary of Santos FC, documenting the trajectory of the club during its 100 years of history.

==Statistics and records==
Pelé holds the record for most Santos appearances, having played 1106 first-team matches from 1956 to 1974. Pepe is second, having played 750 times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by Agenor &quot;Manga&quot; Gomes, with 404 appearances. Five other players also have more than 500 appearances: Zito (727), Lima (696), Dorval (612), Edú (584) and Clodoaldo (510). Pelé is also Santos&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer, with 1091 goals. Four other players have also scored over 200 goals for Santos: Pepe (405), Coutinho (370), Toninho Guerreiro (283) and Feitiço (216).

Borges holds the record for the most &quot;Brasileirão&quot; goals scored in one season for the club (23 in 2011). Feitiço&#x27;s 31 goals in the 1931 Campeonato Paulista was the one-season record in the Campeonato Paulista, until it was surpassed by Pelé&#x27;s 58 goals in 1958, whose record still stands. Officially, the highest home attendance for a Santos match is 132,728, in the Intercontinental Cup, in 1963. Santos has also set records in Brazilian football, most notably the most domestic titles (8 as of 2011) and the most seasons won in a row (5, from 1961 to 1965).

Santos is the joint-most successful Brazilian team in the Copa Libertadores, winning the 1962, 1963 and 2011 editions. Santos is Brazil&#x27;s joint-second in Copa Libertadores semifinal appearances with seven in total. The club is also the first Brazilian side to win the Copa Libertadores without losing a single match, which it did in the 1963 season. In 1962, Santos won the Paulista, Taça Brasil, and the Copa Libertadores.

<text>Leopold Poetsch (or Pötsch) (18 November 1853 – 16 October 1942) was an Austrian history teacher. He was a school teacher of Adolf Hitler at the Linz high school. He influenced the future leader&#x27;s later views, specifically German nationalism.

Hitler wrote about Poetsch in :
While touring Austria after the annexation of 1938, Hitler stopped at Klagenfurt to visit Poetsch. Poetsch revealed that he was a member of the underground Austrian SS which had been outlawed during Austria&#x27;s independence. During this reunion, Hitler and Poetsch conversed in private for over an hour. Hitler would later confide to his traveling companions that, &quot;You cannot imagine how much I owe to that old man.&quot;

He also took some distance from his former pupil, among other things since considering Hitler had become an enemy of Austria.

<text>A ballistic missile submarine is a submarine capable of deploying submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with nuclear warheads. These submarines became a major weapon system in the Cold War because of their nuclear deterrence capability. They can fire missiles thousands of kilometers from their targets, and acoustic quieting makes them difficult to detect (see acoustic signature), thus making them a survivable deterrent in the event of a first strike and a key element of the mutual assured destruction policy of nuclear deterrence. The deployment of ballistic missile submarines is dominated by the United States and Russia (following the collapse of the Soviet Union). In fact, 70% of nuclear warheads in the USA are carried by ballistic missile submarines.

Smaller numbers are in service with France, the United Kingdom, China and India; North Korea is also suspected to have an experimental submarine that is diesel-electric powered.

Ballistic missile submarines should be distinguished from so-called nuclear submarines, which does not refer to a submarine carrying nuclear weapons, but instead refers to submarines with a nuclear propulsion engine.

== History ==
The first sea-based missile deterrent forces were a small number of conventionally powered cruise missile submarines and surface ships fielded by the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1950s, deploying the Regulus I missile and the Soviet P-5 Pyatyorka (also known by its NATO reporting name SS-N-3 Shaddock), both land attack cruise missiles that could be launched from surfaced submarines. Although these forces served until 1964 and (on the Soviet side) were augmented by the nuclear-powered Project 659 (Echo I class) cruise-missile submarines, they were rapidly eclipsed by SLBMs carried by nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines beginning in 1960.

===Ballistic missile submarine origins===

Imperial Japanese Navy s are considered the strategic predecessors to today&#x27;s ballistic submarines, especially to the Regulus missile program, which began about a decade after World War II.

During World War II, German researchers developed the A4 (V2), the first ballistic missile. Toward the end of the war, a V2 version was developed at the Peenemünde Army Research Station to be towed in a launch container behind a submarine. Each submarine was to tow up to three of these 36-meter containers, manned by ten soldiers, through the North Sea. Off England, the container would have been brought to the surface and the missiles fired. Prototypes were already being tested on the Baltic coast before the project had to be abandoned in 1945 with the evacuation of Peenemünde. Three containers were already under construction at that time. The commander of the Army Experimental Station, Walter Dornberger, described the project as &quot;not unpromising&quot;.

The first nation to field ballistic missile submarines was the Soviet Union, whose first experimental vessel was a converted Project 611 (Zulu IV class) diesel-powered submarine equipped with a single ballistic missile launch tube in its sail. This submarine launched the world&#x27;s first SLBM, an R-11FM (SS-N-1 Scud-A, naval modification of SS-1 Scud) on 16 September 1955.

Five additional Project V611 and AV611 (Zulu V class) boats became the world&#x27;s first operational ballistic submarines with two R-11FM missiles each, entering service in 1956–57. They were followed by a series of 23 specifically designed Project 629 (Golf class) boats, completed 1958–1962, with three vertical launch tubes incorporated in the sail/fin of each submarine. The initial R-13 (SS-N-4) ballistic missiles could only be launched with the submarine on the surface and the missile raised to the top of the launch tube, but were followed by R-21 (SS-N-5) missiles beginning in 1963, which were launched with the submarine submerged.

The world&#x27;s first operational nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine was with 16 Polaris A-1 missiles, which entered service in December 1959 and conducted the first SSBN deterrent patrol November 1960 – January 1961. (The United States Navy&#x27;s hull classification symbols for nuclear ballistic missile submarines are SSBN – the &quot;SS&quot; denotes submarine, the &quot;B&quot; denotes ballistic missile, and the &quot;N&quot; denotes that the submarine is nuclear powered.) The Polaris missile and the first US SSBNs were developed by a Special Project office under Rear Admiral W. F. &quot;Red&quot; Raborn, appointed by Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke. &quot;George Washington&quot; was redesigned and rebuilt early in construction from a fast attack submarine, USS &quot;Scorpion&quot;, with a missile compartment welded into the middle. Nuclear power was a crucial advance, allowing a ballistic missile submarine to remain undetected at sea by remaining submerged or occasionally at periscope depth () for an entire patrol.

A significant difference between US and Soviet SLBMs was the fuel type; all US SLBMs have been solid fueled while all Soviet SLBMs before 1980 were liquid fueled. The USSR and subsequently Russia deployed three different SLBM types with solid fuel (R-31 in 1980, R-39 Rif in 1983, and RSM-56 Bulava in 2018). However, these did not replace liquid-fueled SLBMs in service, and new liquid-fueled SLBMs were developed and introduced (R-29RM introduced in 1986, R-29RMU introduced in 2007) after deployment of the R-31 and R-39.

With more missiles on one US SSBN than on five Golf-class boats, the Soviets rapidly fell behind in sea-based deterrent capability. The Soviets were only a year behind the US with their first nuclear powered ballistic missile boat, the ill-fated &quot;K-19&quot; of Project 658 (Hotel class), commissioned in November 1960. However, this class carried the same three-missile armament as the Golfs. The first Soviet nuclear submarine with 16 missiles was the Project 667A (Yankee class), the first of which entered service in 1967, by which time the US had already commissioned 41 SSBNs, nicknamed the &quot;41 for Freedom&quot;.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s first nuclear ballistic missile submarine was the of four submarines built for the Royal Navy as part of the UK Polaris programme. The first to be completed was , laid down in February 1964 and launched in September 1966. After commissioning in 1967, a period of sea trials followed, culminating in the test firing of a Polaris missile from the USAF Eastern Test Range off Cape Kennedy in February 1968. &quot;Resolution&quot; commenced her first operational patrol in June 1968.

France first nuclear ballistic submarine followed very closely. Indeed, the first French SLBMs, Le &quot;Redoutable&quot; was laid down in 1964 in Cherbourg and launched in March 1967. &quot;Le Redoutable&quot; entered operational service in December 1971 and was the first of a series of 6 ships, with a 7,500-ton displacement and equipped with 16 French-made M1 missiles.

=== Deployment and further development ===
The short range of the early SLBMs dictated basing and deployment locations. By the late 1960s the UGM-27 Polaris A-3 missile was deployed on all US and UK ballistic missile submarines. Its range of was a great improvement on the range of Polaris A-1. The A-3 also had three warheads that landed in a pattern around a single target. The Yankee class was initially equipped with the R-27 Zyb (SS-N-6) missile with a range of .

The US was much more fortunate in its basing arrangements than the Soviets. Thanks to NATO and the US possession of Guam, US SSBNs were permanently forward deployed at Advanced Refit Sites in Holy Loch, Scotland and Rota, Spain for Atlantic and Mediterranean areas, and Guam for the Pacific areas, by the middle 1960s resulting in short transit times to patrol areas near the Soviet Union. With two rotating crews per SSBN, about one-third of the total US force could be in a patrol area at any time. The Soviet bases, in Severomorsk near Murmansk for the Atlantic and the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky area for the Pacific, required their submarines to make a long transit through NATO-monitored waters in the Atlantic to their mid-ocean patrol areas to hold the Continental United States (CONUS) at risk.

SSBN submarine mission usually last for 6 months (the maximum duration is limited by the food supply rather than by the amount of the nuclear fuel on board) and occurs with 18 months maintenance and repair breaks. Such relatively short (6 months) mission duration resulted in only a small percentage of the Soviet force occupying patrol areas at any time and was a great motivation for longer-range Soviet SLBMs, which would allow them to patrol close to their bases in areas sometimes referred to as &quot;deep bastions&quot;. The missiles were the R-29 Vysota series (SS-N-8, SS-N-18, SS-N-23), equipped on Projects 667B, 667BD, 667BDR, and 667BDRM (Delta I through Delta IV classes). The SS-N-8, with a range of , entered service on the first Delta-I boat in 1972, before the Yankee class was even completed. A total of 43 Delta-class boats of all types entered service 1972–1990, with the SS-N-18 on the Delta III class and the R-29RM Shtil (SS-N-23) on the Delta IV class. The new missiles had increased range and eventually Multiple Independently Targeted Re-entry Vehicles (MIRV), multiple warheads that could each hit a different target.

The Delta I class had 12 missiles each; the others have 16 missiles each. All Deltas have a tall superstructure (aka casing) to accommodate their large liquid-fueled missiles.

=== Poseidon and Trident I ===
Although the US did not commission any new SSBNs from 1967 through 1981, they did introduce two new SLBMs. Thirty-one of the 41 original US SSBNs were built with larger diameter launch tubes with future missiles in mind. In the early 1970s the Poseidon (C-3) missile entered service, and those 31 SSBNs were backfitted with it. Poseidon offered a massive MIRV capability of up to 14 warheads per missile. Like the Soviets, the US also desired a longer-range missile that would allow SSBNs to be based in CONUS. In the late 1970s the Trident I (C-4) missile was backfitted to 12 of the Poseidon-equipped submarines. The SSBN facilities of the base at Rota, Spain were disestablished and the Naval Submarine Base King&#x27;s Bay in Georgia was built for the Trident I-equipped force.

=== Trident and Typhoon submarines ===
Both the United States and the Soviet Union commissioned larger submarines designed for new missiles in 1981. The American large SSBN was the , also called the &quot;Trident submarine&quot;, with the largest SSBN armament ever of 24 missiles, initially Trident I but built with much larger tubes for the Trident II (D-5) missile, which entered service in 1990. The entire class was converted to use Trident II by the early 2000s. When the commenced sea trials in 1980, two US SSBNs had their missiles removed to comply with SALT treaty requirements; the remaining eight were converted to attack submarines (SSN) by the end of 1982. These were all in the Pacific, and the Guam SSBN base was disestablished; the first several &quot;Ohio&quot;-class boats used new Trident facilities at Naval Submarine Base Bangor, Washington. Eighteen &quot;Ohio&quot;-class boats were commissioned by 1997, four of which were converted to cruise missile submarines (SSGN) in the 2000s to comply with START I treaty requirements.
The Soviet large nuclear ballistic missile submarine was the Project 941 &quot;Akula&quot;, more famously known as the Typhoon class (and not to be confused with the Project 971 &quot;Shchuka&quot; attack submarine, called &quot;Akula&quot; by NATO). The Typhoons were the largest submarines ever built, at 48,000 tons submerged (more than 2½ times the displacement of the &quot;Ohio&quot;-class). They were armed with 20 of the new R-39 Rif (SS-N-20) missiles. Six Typhoons were commissioned 1981–1989.

The United Kingdom commissioned the 15,600-ton in 1985, to carry up to 16 Trident II missiles. France commissioned in 1997 the 12,600-ton , equipped with up to 16 French-made M45 missiles.

===Post-Cold War===
With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1991, construction of new nuclear submarines by Russia was put on hold for over ten years and was slowed in the United States. Additionally the US rapidly decommissioned its 31 older remaining SSBNs, with a few converted to other roles, and the base at Holy Loch in Scotland was disestablished. Most of the former Soviet nuclear submarine force was gradually scrapped under the provisions of the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction agreement through 2012.

The Russian ballistic missile submarine force then stood at six Delta IVs, three Delta IIIs, and a lone Typhoon used as a testbed for new missiles (the R-39s unique to the Typhoons were reportedly scrapped in 2012). Upgraded missiles such as the R-29RMU Sineva (SS-N-23 Sineva) were developed for the Deltas. In 2013 the Russians commissioned the first , also called the &quot;Dolgorukiy&quot; class after the lead vessel. By 2015 two others had entered service. This class is intended to replace the aging Deltas, and carries 16 solid-fuel RSM-56 Bulava missiles, with a reported range of and six MIRV warheads. The US is set to replace the &quot;Ohio&quot;-class, with construction beginning in 2020.

The United Kingdom and France are set to replace in the early 2030s their current fleets composed respectively of &quot;Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Triomphant&quot; with third generation 
&quot;Dreadnought&quot; and unnamed 
SNLE 3G SLBMs.

In 2009, India launched the first of its indigenously built s. The submarines are armed with K15 and K-4ballistic missiles. Follow on variants with longer range ballistic missiles called K-5 and K6 are in works.

North Korea test-fired ballistic missiles from submarines in 2021 and 2022.

==Purpose==
Ballistic missile submarines differ in purpose from attack submarines and cruise missile submarines. Attack submarines specialize in combat with other vessels (including enemy submarines and merchant shipping), and cruise missile submarines are designed to attack large warships and tactical targets on land. However, the primary mission of the ballistic missile boat is nuclear deterrence. They serve as the third leg of the nuclear triad in countries that also operate nuclear-armed land based missiles and aircraft. Accordingly, the mission profile of a ballistic missile submarine concentrates on remaining undetected, rather than aggressively pursuing other vessels.

Ballistic missile submarines are designed for stealth to avoid detection at all costs, and that makes nuclear power, allowing almost the entire patrol to be conducted submerged, very important. They also use many sound-reducing design features, such as anechoic tiles on their hull surfaces, carefully designed propulsion systems, and machinery mounted on vibration-damping mounts. The invisibility and mobility of nuclear ballistic missile submarines offer a reliable means of deterrence against an attack (by maintaining the threat of a second strike), as well as a potential surprise first strike capability.

== Armament ==


In most cases, nuclear ballistic missile submarines generally resemble attack subs of the same generation, with extra length to accommodate SLBMs, such as the Russian R-29 (SS-N-23) or the NATO-fielded and American-manufactured Polaris, Poseidon, and Trident-II missiles. Some early models had to surface to launch their missiles, but modern vessels typically launch while submerged at keel depths of usually less than . Missiles are launched upwards with an initial velocity sufficient for them to pop above the surface, at which point their rocket motors fire, beginning the characteristic parabolic climb-from-launch of a ballistic missile. Compressed air ejection, later replaced by gas-steam ejection, was developed by Captain Harry Jackson of Rear Admiral Raborn&#x27;s Special Project Office when a proposed missile elevator proved too complex. Jackson also derived the armament of 16 missiles used in many SSBNs for the in 1957, based on a compromise between firepower and hull integrity.

==Terminology and locations==
=== United States and United Kingdom ===
In the US Navy, SSBNs are sometimes called Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines, or FBMs. In , ballistic missile submarines are called &quot;boomers&quot;. In the UK, they are known as &quot;bombers&quot;. In both cases, SSBN submarines operate on a two-crew concept, with two complete crews – including two captains – called &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in the United States, &quot;Starboard&quot; and &quot;Port&quot; in the United Kingdom. The designation &quot;SSBN&quot; is also used throughout NATO under STANAG 1166.

=== France ===
The French Navy commissioned its first ballistic missile submarines as &quot;SNLE&quot;, for &quot;Sous-marin Nucléaire Lanceur d&#x27;Engins&quot; (lit. &quot;nuclear-powered device-launching submarines&quot;). The term applies both to ballistic missile submarines in general (for instance &quot;British SNLE&quot; occurs) and, more technically, as a specific classification of the . Its successor, the , is referred to as SNLE-NG (&quot;Nouvelle Génération&quot;, &quot;New Generation&quot;). The two crews used to maximise the availability time of the boats are called (blue) and (red) crews.

=== Soviet Union and Russian Federation ===
The Soviets called this type of ship &quot;RPKSN&quot; (lit. &quot;Strategic Purpose Underwater Missile Cruiser&quot;). This designation was applied to the . Another designation used was &quot;PLARB&quot;(&quot;«ПЛАРБ»&quot; – подводная лодка атомная с баллистическими ракетами, which translates as &quot;Nuclear Submarine with Ballistic Missiles&quot;). This designation was applied to smaller submarines such as the Delta class. After a peak in 1984 (following Able Archer 83), Russian PLARB deterrence patrols have declined to the point where there is less than one patrol per sub each year and at best one sub on patrol at any time. Hence the Russians do not use multiple crews per boat.

=== India ===
India classifies this type of a submarine as a &quot;Strategic Strike Nuclear Submarine&quot;.

<doc id="187259" wikidata="Q155236" url="?curid=187259" title="Udo Jürgens">
<text>Jürgen Udo Bockelmann (30 September 1934 – 21 December 2014), generally known as Udo Jürgens, was an Austrian composer and singer of popular music whose career spanned over 50 years. He won the Eurovision Song Contest 1966 for Austria, composed close to 1,000 songs, and sold over 104 million records. In 2007, he additionally obtained Swiss citizenship. In 2010, he legally changed his name to Udo Jürgens Bockelmann.

He is credited with broadening German-language pop music beyond the traditional post-war &quot;schlager&quot; (hit song) in the 1950s by infusing it with a modern pop appeal and French chanson style. His compositions and arrangements attracted fans of all ages, and he continued to fill venues in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland until his death at age 80.

==Career==

In 1952, Udo Bolan, as he was called then, formed the Udo Bolan Quartet in Klagenfurt, Austria, appearing regularly at the Café Obelisk in Klagenfurt with Englishman Johnny Richards on drums, Klaus Behmel on guitar, and Bruno Geiger on Bass. The quartet played regularly at various dance and jazz venues and also broadcast on Radio Alpenland and the British Forces Radio network produced by Mike Fior.

In 1950, he won a composer contest organized by Austria&#x27;s public broadcasting channel ORF with the song &quot;Je t&#x27;aime&quot;. He wrote the 1961 worldwide hit &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot;, sung by Shirley Bassey.

In 1964, Jürgens represented Austria for the first time at the Eurovision Song Contest 1964 with the song &quot;Warum nur, warum?&quot;, finishing sixth. The UK participant, Matt Monro, was impressed with the melody and covered the song (with English lyrics by his manager Don Black) as &quot;Walk Away&quot;, which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart and number 23 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

Jürgens&#x27; song &quot;Sag ihr, ich lass sie grüßen&quot; came fourth in 1965&#x27;s contest, and on his third try, he won the Eurovision Song Contest 1966 in Luxembourg with &quot;Merci, Chérie&quot;, which became an English-language hit for Vince Hill, another cover by Monro, and one of Jürgens&#x27; most recognized compositions. Jürgens&#x27; version alone sold over one million copies, and he was awarded a gold disc by Deutsche Vogue in 1966.

In the following years, Jürgens wrote songs like &quot;Griechischer Wein&quot;, &quot;Aber bitte mit Sahne&quot;, &quot;Mit 66 Jahren&quot;, and—one of his biggest successes—&quot;Buenos Días, Argentina&quot;, which he performed together with the Germany national football team in 1978 in Argentina.
In 1977, he invited The Supremes to appear as guests on his televised and recorded gala concert. The Supremes (Mary Wilson, Scherrie Payne, and Susaye Greene), who were on a brief farewell tour of Europe at the time, performed two of their own hits, &quot;You Are the Heart of Me&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re My Driving Wheel&quot;, as well as a duet with Jürgens&#x27; &quot;Walk Away&quot; in English.

In 1979, he released a disco album entitled &quot;Udo &#x27;80&quot;, which spawned the hit single &quot;Ich weiß was ich will&quot;. This song was also released as a 12&quot; disco single in an extended remix for nightclubs.

On 2 December 2007, the jukebox musical &quot;Ich war noch niemals in New York&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve never been to New York&quot;) opened in Hamburg&#x27;s Operettenhaus. It weaves songs by Jürgens into a familial storyline, similar to the treatment of ABBA songs in &quot;Mamma Mia!,&quot; the musical succeeded at the venue.

Like Keith Richards, Jürgens is very famous in Argentina, where he has one of the biggest fan bases outside of German speaking countries.

Since 2015, Jürgens holds the worldwide-record as the artist with the longest presence in the charts ever—more than 57 years from his first entry 1958 till 2015. On 16 December 2022, a new album consisting of his legacies was released by his children. This reached #1 on the German charts on 24 December. Thus, Jürgens has been in the German charts for more than eight decades.

==Cover versions==

&quot;Merci, Chérie&quot;, whose original German lyrics were written by Thomas Hörbiger, has been translated or adapted into several languages and covered by dozens of artists in both vocal and instrumental recordings. These versions include:
* &quot;Merci Chérie&quot; by Claude Carrère and André Salvet (French)
* &quot;Merci&quot; by Vito Pallavicini (Italian)
* &quot;Merci Cherie&quot; by Baker Cavendish (English)
* &quot;Merci Cherie&quot; by Fred Bekky (Dutch)
* &quot;Merci Chérie&quot; by Al Sandström (Swedish)
* &quot;Merci Chérie&quot; by Gina Trandafirescu (Romanian)
* &quot;Merci Cheri&quot; by Andrzej Ozga (Polish)
Jürgens himself recorded many of the translations for international release, including a version in Japanese. More recent covers include Belinda Carlisle&#x27;s 2007 recording of the French version.

In addition to recording Cavendish&#x27;s &quot;Merci, Chérie&quot; lyric, Matt Monro covered five more Jürgens compositions, all with English lyrics (unrelated to the German ones), written by his manager Don Black. Four of these became closely associated with Monro (and were subsequently covered by Jürgens himself): 
* &quot;Warum nur warum?&quot; became &quot;Walk Away&quot; (a 1964 Top 40 hit in both the U.S. and UK)
* &quot;Du sollst die Welt für mich sein&quot; became &quot;Without You&quot; (a 1965 UK Top 40 hit)
* &quot;Was ich dir sagen will&quot; became &quot;The Music Played&quot; (1968)
* &quot;Illusionen&quot; became &quot;If I Never Sing Another Song&quot; (1977), which was later performed by Frankie Laine, Shirley Bassey, Sammy Davis Jr., and other entertainers.

A fifth Jürgens song, &quot;In dieser Welt&quot;, became &quot;Lovin&#x27; You Again&quot;, and in 1969, Matt Monro recorded both Spanish and English versions, the latter not released until August 2012. (Monro also recorded Spanish versions of &quot;Walk Away&quot; and &quot;The Music Played&quot;; all three Spanish lyrics were adapted for Monro from Don Black&#x27;s versions by Leonardo Schultz, who also produced the Spanish recordings.)

In one of his last recording sessions, Bing Crosby covered an English version of Jürgens&#x27; &quot;Griechischer Wein&quot; called &quot;Come Share the Wine&quot;, which also was written by Black. The song was released after Crosby&#x27;s death in 1977 as the title track of a compilation album and was later recorded by Al Martino.

In 1979, Marty Robbins released an English version of &quot;Buenos Dias Argentina&quot; that became a latter-day standard for Robbins.

In the early 1990s, German thrash metal band Sodom released a &#x27;metalized&#x27; cover of the boogie &quot;Aber bitte mit Sahne&quot;.

In 2009, the German band Sportfreunde Stiller covered &quot;Ich war noch niemals in New York&quot; together with Jürgens on their &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; concert in Munich.

==Death==
On December 21, 2014, Udo Jürgens collapsed unconscious during a walk in the municipality of Gottlieben (Canton of Thurgau), where he had rented a house. Despite resuscitation attempts, he passed away at the Cantonal Hospital in Münsterlingen at the age of 80 due to heart failure. Two weeks earlier, he had completed the first part of his 25th concert tour in Zurich which covered 27 cities. The tour began on October 24, 2014 in Heilbronn and ended in Zurich Hallenstadion on December 7, 2014. His final public performance took place on December 12, 2014, at the Velodrom in Berlin during the Helene Fischer Show. The performance was broadcast on ZDF on December 25, 2014.

On January 15, 2015, around 200 friends, family and companions gathered in Zurich for a memorial service to bid farewell to Udo Jürgens. His urn was placed in the Volkshalle of the Vienna City Hall, allowing the public to pay their final respects. High-ranking officials, including the then Austrian President Heinz Fischer and Chancellor Werner Faymann, signed the condolence books. Jürgens was laid to rest in an honorary grave of the City of Vienna at the Vienna Central Cemetery.

The gravestone, depicting a grand piano draped in a white mourning cloth, was designed by his brother Manfred Bockelmann and sculpted in Laas marble by artist Hans Muhr. The memorial plaque features one of his lyrics—after multiple corrections of an initially misspelled inscription—reading: &quot;Ihr seid das Notenblatt, das alles für mich war. Ich lass’ Euch alles – ich lass’ Euch alles da!&quot; (&quot;You are the sheet music that meant everything to me. I leave you everything – I leave you everything behind!&quot;).

Auction
Between January 23 and January 30 2025, a selection of Udo Jürgens&#x27; possessions was auctioned by Sotheby’s. The proceeds will go to the Udo Jürgens Foundation, which supports children without parental care and provides assistance to young musical talents.

One of the highlights of the auction was a Schimmel transparent concert grand piano from Jürgens&#x27; estate, which sold for €240,000—far exceeding its estimated value which had originally been valued at €20,000 to €30,000.

The auction, which included many other memorabilia from Jürgens’ life, saw overwhelming demand, with nearly 400 bidders placing a total of 3,150 bids. In many cases, the highest bid changed multiple times before the final sale.

In the end, the total auction proceeds amounted to approximately €1.7 million—far surpassing the initial estimate of €370,000 to €500,000 for the entire collection.

==Family==
* His brother, Manfred Bockelmann (born 1 July 1943), is a painter.
* His son by his first marriage, John Jürgens (born 20 February 1964), is a singer, actor and DJ.
* His daughter by his first marriage, Jenny Jürgens (born 22 January 1967), is an actress.
* His uncle, Werner Bockelmann (23 September 1907 – 7 April 1968), was mayor of Frankfurt am Main.
As Jürgens was not the real family name of Udo Jürgens, he was not related to real Jürgens&#x27; like the singer Andrea Jürgens (1967 – 2017) or the actor Curd Jürgens (1915 – 1982).

<doc id="187260" wikidata="Q1149548" url="?curid=187260" title="Culture of Greece">
<text>The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years, beginning in Minoan and later in Mycenaean Greece, continuing most notably into Classical Greece, while influencing the Roman Empire and its successor the Byzantine Empire. Other cultures and states such as the Frankish states, the Ottoman Empire, the Venetian Republic and Bavarian and Danish monarchies have also left their influence on modern Greek culture.

Modern democracies owe a debt to Greek beliefs in government by the people, trial by jury, and equality under the law. The ancient Greeks pioneered in many fields that rely on systematic thought, including biology, geometry, history, philosophy, and physics. They introduced important literary forms as epic and lyric poetry, history, tragedy, and comedy. In their pursuit of order and proportion, the Greeks created an ideal of beauty that strongly influenced Western art.

== Arts ==
=== Architecture ===
==== Ancient Greece ====
The first great ancient Greek civilization were the Minoans, a Bronze Age Aegean civilization on Crete and other Aegean Islands, that flourished from c. 3000 BC to c. 1450 BC and, after a late period of decline, finally ended around 1100 BC during the early Greek Dark Ages. At the height of their power, they built architecture ranging from city houses and Minoan palaces. Exemplary of this construction was the palace at Knossos, which was composed of two to three levels, had over 500 rooms, and many terraces with porticos and stairs. The interior of this palace included monumental reception halls, vast apartments for the queen and bridesmaids, bathtubs with complete sewage and drainage systems, food deposits, shops, theatres, sport arenas, and other amenities. The walls were built of high-quality masonry that was covered with highly decorated frescos.

Later, the Mycenaean civilization erected palatial structures at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos.
After the Greek Dark Ages, architecture developed into a style that, together with Roman, inspired Classical architecture and later Neoclassical. Examples of this style were their temples, such as the Parthenon and Erectheion which are both based in the Acropolis of Athens, and theatres. Both temples and theatres used a complex mix of optical illusions and balanced ratios. Classical Ancient Greek temples usually consist of a base with stairs at each edges (known as &quot;crepidoma&quot;), a cella (or &quot;naos&quot;) with a cult statue in it, columns, an entablature, and two pediments, one on the front side and another in the back. By the 4th century BC, Greek architects and stonemasons had developed a system of rules for all buildings known as the orders: the Doric, the Ionic, and the Corinthian. They are most easily recognised by their columns (especially by the capitals). The Doric column is stout and basic, the Ionic one is slimmer and has four scrolls (called &quot;volutes&quot;) at the corners of the capital, and the Corinthian column is just like the Ionic one, but the capital is completely different, being decorated with acanthus leafs and four scrolls.

==== Byzantine Greece ====
Following the relocation of the capital of the Roman Empire to Constantinople in 330 AD, and the fall of the Western Roman Empire some 150 years later, the architects of the Eastern Roman Empire, or the Byzantine Empire, built city walls, palaces, hippodromes, bridges, aqueducts, and churches. One of the more famous type of church constructed by the Byzantines was the basilica, which was very widespread and received the most development of the churches that were built in the empire. Through modifications and adaptations of local inspiration, the Byzantine style of architecture was used as the main source of inspiration for architectural styles in Eastern Orthodox countries. For example, in Romania, the Brâncovenesc style is highly based on Byzantine architecture, but also has individual Romanian characteristics.

As with the Parthenon, which was built in dedication to the Ancient Greek religion, the Hagia Sophia was considered an iconic church of Christianity. The temples of both religions differ substantially in terms of their exterior and interior aspect. In Antiquity, the exterior was the most important part of the temple, because in the interior, where the cult statue of the deity to whom the temple was built was kept, only the priest had access. The ceremonies here held outside, and what the worshipers view was the facade of the temple, consisting of columns, with an entablature and two pediments. Meanwhile, Christian liturgies were held in the interior of the churches, the exterior usually having little to no ornamentation.

Byzantine architecture often featured marble columns, coffered ceilings and sumptuous decoration, including the extensive use of mosaics with golden backgrounds. The building material used by Byzantine architects was no longer marble, which was highly appreciated and utilised by the Ancient Greeks, instead opting for mostly stone and brick while using thin alabaster sheets for windows.

==== Modern Greece ====
After the independence of Greece and during the nineteenth century, Neoclassical architecture was heavily used for both public and private buildings. The 19th-century architecture of Athens and other cities of the Kingdom of Greece is mostly influenced by architects like Theophil Hansen, Ernst Ziller, Panagis Kalkos, Lysandros Kaftanzoglou, Anastasios Metaxas and Stamatios Kleanthis. Meanwhile, churches in Greece, on the other hand, experienced a Neo-Byzantine revival.

In 1933, the Athens Charter, a manifesto of the modernist movement, was signed and published by Le Corbusier. The primary architects of this movement were: Ioannis Despotopoulos, Dimitris Pikionis, Patroklos Karantinos and Takis Zenetos. Following World War II, and the Greek Civil War, the massive construction of apartment buildings in major Greek city centres, was a major contributory factor for the Greek economy and the post-war recovery. The first skyscrapers were also constructed during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the OTE Tower and the Athens Tower Complex.

=== Cinema ===

Cinema first appeared in Greece in 1896, but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907. In 1914, the &quot;Asty Films Company&quot; was founded, which started the production of long films in Greece. &quot;Golfo&quot; (Γκόλφω), a well known traditional love story, is the first Greek long movie, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931, Orestis Laskos directed &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; (&quot;Δάφνις και Χλόη&quot;), contained the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad. In 1944, Katina Paxinou was honoured with the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.

The 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many as the Golden age of Greek cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: Michael Cacoyannis, Alekos Sakellarios, Melina Mercouri, Nikos Tsiforos, Iakovos Kambanelis, Katina Paxinou, Nikos Koundouros, Ellie Lambeti, Irene Papas, etc. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements. Notable films were &quot;The Counterfeit Coin&quot; (&quot;Η κάλπικη λίρα&quot;, 1955, directed by Giorgos Tzavellas), &quot;Bitter Bread&quot; (&quot;Πικρό Ψωμί&quot;, 1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), &quot;The Ogre of Athens&quot; (&quot;O Drakos&quot;, 1956, directed by Nikos Koundouros), &quot;Stella&quot; (1955, directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis). Cacoyannis also directed &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. Finos Film also contributed to this period with movies such as &quot;Λατέρνα, Φτώχεια και Φιλότιμο&quot;, &quot;The Auntie from Chicago&quot; (&quot;Η Θεία από το Σικάγο&quot;), &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Cheek&quot; (&quot;Το ξύλο βγήκε από τον Παράδεισο&quot;), and many more. During the 1970s and 1980s Theo Angelopoulos directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film &quot;Eternity and a Day&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.

There were also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora such as the Greek-American Elia Kazan.

=== Music and dances ===
Greece has a diverse and highly influential musical tradition, with ancient music influencing the Roman Empire, and Byzantine liturgical chants and secular music influencing middle eastern music and the Renaissance. Modern Greek music combines these elements, to carry Greeks&#x27; interpretation of a wide range of musical forms.

==== Ancient Greece ====

The history of music in Greece begins with the music of ancient Greece, largely structured on the Lyre and other supporting string instruments of the era. Beyond the well-known structural legacies of the Pythagorean scale, and the related mathematical developments it upheld to define western classical music, relatively little is understood about the precise character of music during this period; we do know, however, that it left, as so often, a strong mark on the culture of Rome. What has been gleaned about the social role and character of ancient Greek music comes largely from pottery and other forms of Greek art.

Ancient Greeks believed that dancing was invented by the gods and therefore associated it with religious ceremony. They believed that the gods offered this gift to select mortals only, who in turn taught dancing to their fellow-men.

Periodic evidence in ancient texts indicates that dance was held in high regard, in particular for its educational qualities. Dance, along with writing, music, and physical exercise, was fundamental to the commenced in a circle and ended with the dancers facing one another. When not dancing in a circle the dancers held their hands high or waved them to the left and right. They held cymbals (very like the zilia of today) or a kerchief in their hands, and their movements were emphasized by their long sleeves. As they danced, they sang, either set songs or extemporized ones, sometimes in unison, sometimes in refrain, repeating the verse sung by the lead dancer. The onlookers joined in, clapping the rhythm or singing. Professional singers, often the musicians themselves, composed lyrics to suit the occasion.

==== Byzantine Greece ====

The Byzantine music is also of major significance to the history and development of European music, as liturgical chants became the foundation and stepping stone for music of the Renaissance (see: Renaissance Music). It is also certain that Byzantine music included an extensive tradition of instrumental court music and dance; any other picture would be both incongruous with the historically and archaeologically documented opulence of the Eastern Roman Empire. There survive a few but explicit accounts of secular music. A characteristic example is the accounts of pneumatic organs, whose construction was further advanced in the eastern empire prior to their development in the west following the Renaissance.

Byzantine instruments included the guitar, single, double or multiple flute, sistrum, timpani (drum), psaltirio, Sirigs, lyre, cymbals, keras and kanonaki.

Popular dances of this period included the &quot;Syrtos&quot;, &quot;Geranos&quot;, &quot;Mantilia&quot;, &quot;Saximos&quot;, &quot;Pyrichios&quot;, and &quot;Kordakas&quot; . Some of these dances have their origins in the ancient period and are still enacted in some form today.

==== Modern Greece ====

A range of domestically and internationally known composers and performers across the musical spectrum have found success in modern Greece, while traditional Greek music is noted as a mixture of influences from indigenous culture with those of west and east. A few Ottoman as well as medieval Italian elements can be heard in the traditional songs, &quot;dhimotiká&quot;, as well as in the modern bluesy rembétika music. A well-known Greek musical instrument is the bouzouki. &quot;Bouzouki&quot; is a descriptive Turkish name, but the instrument itself is probably of Greek origin (from the ancient Greek lute known as pandoura, a kind of guitar, clearly visible in ancient statues, especially female figurines of the &quot;Tanagraies&quot; playing cord instruments).

Famous Greek musicians and composers of modern era include the central figure of 20th-century European modernism Iannis Xenakis, a composer, architect and theorist. Maria Callas, Nikos Skalkottas, Mikis Theodorakis, Dimitris Mitropoulos, Manos Hadjidakis and Vangelis also lead twentieth-century Greek contributions, alongside Demis Roussos, Nana Mouskouri, Yanni, Georges Moustaki, Eleni Karaindrou and others.

The birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music (Heptanesean or Ionian School, Greek:&quot;Επτανησιακή Σχολή&quot;) came through the Ionian Islands (notable composers include Spyridon Samaras, Nikolaos Mantzaros and Pavlos Carrer), while Manolis Kalomiris is considered the founder of the &quot;Greek National School&quot;.

Greece is one of the few places in Europe where the day-to-day role of folk dance is sustained. Rather than functioning as a museum piece preserved only for performances and special events, it is a vivid expression of everyday life. Occasions for dance are usually weddings, family celebrations, and paneyeria (Patron Saints&#x27; name days). Dance has its place in ceremonial customs that are still preserved in Greek villages, such as dancing the bride during a wedding and dancing the of the bride during the wedding preparations. The carnival and Easter offer more opportunities for family gatherings and dancing. Greek taverns providing live entertainment often include folk dances in their program.

Regional characteristics have developed over the years because of variances in climatic conditions, land morphology and people&#x27;s social lives. &quot;Kalamatianos&quot; and &quot;Syrtos&quot; are considered Pan-Hellenic dances and are danced all over the world in diaspora communities. Others have also crossed boundaries and are known beyond the regions where they originated; these include the &quot;Pentozali&quot; from Crete, &quot;Hasapiko&quot; from Constantinople, &quot;Zonaradikos&quot; from Thrace, &quot;Serra&quot; from Pontos and &quot;Balos&quot; from the Aegean islands.

The avant-garde choreographer, director and dancer Dimitris Papaioannou was responsible for the critically successful opening ceremony of the 2004 Olympic Games, with a conception that reflected the classical influences on modern and experimental Greek dance forms.

=== Painting ===

==== Ancient Greece ====
There were several interconnected traditions of painting in ancient Greece. Due to their technical differences, they underwent somewhat differentiated developments. Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record. The most respected form of art, according to authors like Pliny or Pausanias, were individual, mobile paintings on wooden boards, technically described as panel paintings. Also, the tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the Minoan and Mycenaean Bronze Age, with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like Knossos, Tiryns and Mycenae.

Much of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully. This aspect of Greek stonework is described as polychrome (from Greek &quot;πολυχρωμία&quot;, &quot;πολύ&quot; = many and &quot;χρώμα&quot; = colour). Due to intensive weathering, polychromy on sculpture and architecture has substantially or totally faded in most cases.

==== Byzantine Greece ====

Byzantine art is the term created for the Eastern Roman Empire from about the 5th century AD until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its &quot;abstract,&quot; or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on icons and hagiographies.

==== Post-Byzantine and Modern Greece ====


The term Cretan School describes an important school of icon painting, also known as Post-Byzantine art, which flourished while Crete was under Venetian rule during the late Middle Ages, reaching its climax after the Fall of Constantinople, becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements. The most famous product of the school, El Greco, was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe.

The Heptanese School of painting succeeded the Cretan school as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the Ottomans in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing Western European artistic influence, and also saw the first significant depiction of secular subjects. The school was based in the Ionian islands, which were not part of Ottoman Greece, from the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century.

Modern Greek painting, after the independence and the creation of the modern Greek state, began to be developed around the time of Romanticism and the Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art. Notable painters of the era include Nikolaos Gyzis, Georgios Jakobides, Nikiphoros Lytras, Konstantinos Volanakis and Theodoros Vryzakis.

=== Sculpture ===

==== Ancient Greece ====

Ancient Greek monumental sculpture was composed almost entirely of marble or bronze; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century. Both marble and bronze are fortunately easy to form and very durable. Chryselephantine sculptures, used for temple cult images and luxury works, used gold, most often in leaf form and ivory for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived.
By the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces. It was not until published findings by German archaeologist Vinzenz Brinkmann in the late 20th and early 21st century that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact. Using high-intensity lamps, ultraviolet light, specially designed cameras, plaster casts, and certain powdered minerals, Brinkmann proved that the entire Parthenon, including the actual structure as well as the statues, had been painted.

==== Byzantine Greece ====
The Byzantines inherited the early Christian distrust of monumental sculpture in religious art, and produced only reliefs, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in sharp contrast to the medieval art of the West, where monumental sculpture revived from Carolingian art onwards. Small ivories were also mostly in relief.

The so-called &quot;minor arts&quot; were very important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation Consular diptychs or caskets such as the Veroli casket, hardstone carvings, enamels, jewelry, metalwork, and figured silks were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era. Many of these were religious in nature, although a large number of objects with secular or non-representational decoration were produced: for example, ivories representing themes from classical mythology. Byzantine ceramics were relatively crude, as pottery was never used at the tables of the rich, who ate off silver.

==== Modern Greece ====
After the establishment of the Greek Kingdom and the western influence of Neoclassicism, sculpture was re-discovered by the Greek artists. Main themes included ancient Greek antiquity, the War of Independence and important figures of Greek history.

Notable sculptors of the new state were Leonidas Drosis (his major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the Academy of Athens, Lazaros Sochos, Georgios Vitalis, Dimitrios Filippotis, Ioannis Kossos, Yannoulis Chalepas, Georgios Bonanos and Lazaros Fytalis.

=== Theatre ===

==== Ancient Greece ====

Theatre was born in Greece. The city-state of Classical Athens, which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its centre, where it was institutionalised as part of a festival called the Dionysia, which honoured the god Dionysus. Tragedy (late 6th century BC), comedy (486 BC), and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies and allies in order to promote a common cultural identity.

The word τραγῳδία (&quot;tragoidia&quot;), from which the word &quot;tragedy&quot; is derived, is a compound of two Greek words: τράγος (&quot;tragos&quot;) or &quot;goat&quot; and ᾠδή (&quot;ode&quot;) meaning &quot;song&quot;, from ἀείδειν (&quot;aeidein&quot;), &quot;to sing&quot;.
This etymology indicates a link with the practices of the ancient Dionysian cults. It is impossible, however, to know with certainty how these fertility rituals became the basis for tragedy and comedy.

==== Middle Ages ====
During the Byzantine period, the theatrical art was heavily declined. According to Marios Ploritis, the only form survived was the folk theatre (&quot;Mimos&quot; and &quot;Pantomimos&quot;), despite the hostility of the official state. Later, during the Ottoman period, the main theatrical folk art was the &quot;Karagiozis&quot;. The renaissance which led to the modern Greek theatre, took place in the Venetian Crete. Significant dramatists include Vitsentzos Kornaros and Georgios Chortatzis.

==== Modern Greece ====

The modern Greek theatre was born after the Greek independence, in the early 19th century, and initially was influenced by the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama, such as the Italian opera. The Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù was the first theatre and opera house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, Spyridon Xyndas&#x27; &quot;The Parliamentary Candidate&quot; (based on an exclusively Greek libretto) was performed. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the Athenian theatre scene was dominated by revues, musical comedies, operettas and nocturnes and notable playwrights included Spyridon Samaras, Dionysios Lavrangas, Theophrastos Sakellaridis and others.

The National Theatre of Greece was founded in 1880. Notable playwrights of the modern Greek theatre include Alexandros Rizos Rangavis, Gregorios Xenopoulos, Nikos Kazantzakis, Angelos Terzakis, Pantelis Horn, Alekos Sakellarios and Iakovos Kambanelis, while notable actors include Cybele Andrianou, Marika Kotopouli, Aimilios Veakis, Orestis Makris, Katina Paxinou, Manos Katrakis and Dimitris Horn. Significant directors include Dimitris Rontiris, Alexis Minotis and Karolos Koun.

== Cuisine ==


Greek cuisine has a long tradition and its flavors change with the season and its geography. Greek cookery, historically a forerunner of Western cuisine, spread its culinary influence – via ancient Rome – throughout Europe and beyond.

Ancient Greek cuisine was characterized by its frugality and was founded on the &quot;Mediterranean triad&quot;: wheat, olive oil, and wine, with meat being rarely eaten and fish being more common. It was Archestratos in 320 B.C. who wrote the first cookbook in history. Greece has a culinary tradition of some 4,000 years.

The Byzantine cuisine was similar to the classical cuisine including however new ingredients that were not available before, like caviar, nutmeg and lemons, basil, with fish continuing to be an integral part of the diet. Culinary advice was influenced by the theory of humors, first put forth by the ancient Greek doctor Claudius Aelius Galenus.

The modern Greek cuisine has also influences from the Ottoman and Italian cuisine due to the Ottoman and Venetian dominance through the centuries.

=== Wine production ===
Greece is one of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world. The earliest evidence of Greek wine has been dated to 6,500 years ago where wine was produced on a household or communal basis. In ancient times, as trade in wine became extensive, it was transported from end to end of the Mediterranean; Greek wine had especially high prestige in Italy under the Roman Empire. In the medieval period, wines exported from Crete, Monemvasia and other Greek ports fetched high prices in northern Europe.

== Education ==

Education in Greece is compulsory for all children 6–15 years old; namely, it includes Primary (Dimotiko) and Lower Secondary (Gymnasio) Education. The school life of the students, however, can start from the age of 2.5 years (pre-school education) in institutions (private and public) called &quot;Vrefonipiakoi Paidikoi Stathmi&quot; (creches). In some Vrefonipiakoi Stathmoi there are also Nipiaka Tmimata (nursery classes) which operate along with the Nipiagogeia (kindergartens).

Post-compulsory Secondary Education, according to the reforms of 1997 and 2006, consists of two main school types: Genika Lykeia (General Upper Secondary Schools) and the Epaggelmatika Lykeia (Vocational Upper Secondary Schools), as well as the Epaggelmatikes Sxoles (Vocational Schools). Musical, Ecclesiastical and Physical Education Gymnasia and Lykeia are also in operation.

Post-compulsory Secondary Education also includes the Vocational Training Institutes (IEK), which provide formal but unclassified level of education. These Institutes are not classified as an educational level, because they accept both Gymnasio (lower secondary school) and Lykeio (upper secondary school) graduates according to the relevant specializations they provide. Public higher education is divided into Universities and Technological Education Institutes (TEI). Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place at the third grade of Lykeio. Additionally, students are admitted to the Hellenic Open University upon the completion of the 22 year of age by drawing lots.

Nea Dimokratia (New Democracy), the Greek conservative right political party, has claimed that it will change the law so that private universities gain recognition. Without official recognition, students who have an EES degree are unable to work in the public sector. PASOK took some action after EU intervention, namely the creation of a special government agency that certifies the vocational status of certain EES degree holders. However, their academic status still remains a problem. The issue of full recognition is still an issue of debate among Greek politicians.

The Institute of Entrepreneurship Development (iED) is a Greek Non-governmental organization formed for the promotion of innovation and for enhancing the spirit of entrepreneurship intending to link with other European initiatives.

== Greek people ==

The origins of Western literature and of the main branches of Western learning may be traced to the era of Greek greatness that began before 700 BC with the epics of Homer, the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Hesiod, the first didactic poet, put into epic verse his descriptions of pastoral life, including practical advice on farming, and allegorical myths. The poets Alcaeus of Mytilene, Sappho, Anacreon, and Bacchylides wrote of love, war, and death in lyrics of great feeling and beauty. Pindar celebrated the Panhellenic athletic festivals in vivid odes. The fables of the slave Aesop have been famous for more than 2,500 years. Three of the world&#x27;s greatest dramatists were Aeschylus, author of the &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy; Sophocles, author of the Theban plays; and Euripides, author of &quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, and &quot;The Bacchae&quot;. Aristophanes, the greatest author of comedies, satirized the mores of his day in a series of brilliant plays. Three great historians were Herodotus, regarded as the father of history, known for &quot;The Persian Wars&quot;; Thucydides, who generally avoided myth and legend and applied greater standards of historical accuracy in his History of the Peloponnesian War; and Xenophon, best known for his account of the Greek retreat from Persia, the &quot;Anabasis&quot;. Outstanding literary figures of the Hellenistic period were Menander, the chief representative of a newer type of comedy; the poets Callimachus, Theocritus, and Apollonius Rhodius, author of the &quot;Argonautica&quot;; and Polybius, who wrote a detailed history of the Mediterranean world. Noteworthy in the Roman period were Strabo, a writer on geography; Plutarch, the father of biography, whose &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; of famous Greeks and Romans is a chief source of information about great figures of antiquity; Pausanias, a travel writer; and Lucian, a satirist.

The leading philosophers of the period preceding Greece&#x27;s golden age were Thales, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Protagoras, and Democritus. Socrates investigated ethics and politics. His greatest pupil, Plato, used Socrates&#x27; question-and-answer method of investigating philosophical problems in his famous dialogues. Plato&#x27;s pupil Aristotle established the rules of deductive reasoning but also used observation and inductive reasoning, applying himself to the systematic study of almost every form of human endeavor. Outstanding in the Hellenistic period were Epicurus, the philosopher of moderation; Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism; and Diogenes of Sinope, the famous Cynic. The oath of Hippocrates, the father of medicine, is still recited by newly graduating physicians. Euclid evolved the system of geometry that bears his name. Archimedes discovered the principles of mechanics and hydrostatics. Eratosthenes calculated the earth&#x27;s circumference with remarkable accuracy, and Hipparchus Founded scientific astronomy. Galen was an outstanding physician of ancient times.

The sculptor Phidias created the statue of Athena and the figure of Zeus in the temple at Olympia and supervised the construction and decoration of the Parthenon. Another renowned sculptor was Praxiteles.

The legal reforms of Solon served as the basis of Athenian democracy. The Athenian general Miltiades the Younger led the victory over the Persians at Marathon in 490 BC, and Themistocles was chiefly responsible for the victory at Salamis 10 years later. Pericles, the virtual ruler of Athens for more than 25 years, added to the political power of that city, inaugurated the construction of the Parthenon and other noteworthy buildings, and encouraged the arts of sculpture and painting. With the decline of Athens, first Sparta and then Thebes, under the great military tactician Epaminondas, gained the ascendancy; but soon thereafter, two military geniuses, Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great, gained control over all of Greece and formed a vast empire stretching as far east as India. It was against Philip that Demosthenes, the greatest Greek orator, directed his diatribes, the &quot;Philippics&quot;.

The most renowned Greek painter during the Renaissance was El Greco, born in Crete, whose major works, painted in Spain, have influenced many 20th-century artists. An outstanding modern literary figure is Nikos Kazantzakis, a novelist and poet who composed a vast sequel to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Leading modern poets are Kostis Palamas, and Constantine P. Cavafy, as well as George Seferis, and Odysseus Elytis, winners of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1963 and 1979, respectively. The work of social theorist Cornelius Castoriadis is known for its multidisciplinary breadth. Musicians of stature are the composers Nikos Skalkottas, Iannis Xenakis, and Mikis Theodorakis; the conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos; and the soprano Maria Callas. Filmmakers who have won international acclaim are Greek-Americans John Cassavetes and Elia Kazan, and Greeks Michael Cacoyannis and Costa-Gavras. Actresses of note are Katina Paxinou; Melina Mercouri, who was appointed minister of culture and science in the Socialist cabinet in 1981; and Irene Papas.

Outstanding Greek public figures in the 20th century include Cretan-born Eleutherios Venizelos, prominent statesman of the interwar period; Ioannis Metaxas, dictator from 1936 until his death; Constantine Karamanlis, prime minister (1955–63, 1974–80) and president (1980–85) of Greece; George Papandreou, head of the Center Union Party and prime minister (1963–65); and his son Andreas Papandreou, the PASOK leader who became prime minister in 1981. Costas Simitis was leader of PASOK and prime minister from 1996 to 2004. He was succeeded by Kostas Karamanlis.

== Language ==

The Greek language is the official language of the Hellenic Republic and the Republic of Cyprus and has a total of 15 million speakers worldwide. It is an Indo-European language. It is particularly remarkable in the depth of its continuity, with written records spanning over 3400 years. The earliest preserved form is Mycenaean Greek, written in the Linear B script during the Late Bronze Age. Modern Greek descends from Koine Greek, which formed from dialect leveling of Ancient Greek dialects such as Attic Greek and Doric Greek.

Greek has had enormous impact on other languages both directly on the Romance languages, and indirectly through its influence on the emerging Latin language during the early days of Rome. Signs of this influence, and its many developments, can be seen throughout the family of Western European languages.

=== Internet and &quot;Greeklish&quot; ===

More recently, the rise of internet-based communication services as well as cell phones have caused a distinctive form of Greek written partially, and sometimes fully in Latin characters to emerge; this is known as Greeklish, a form that has spread across the Greek diaspora and even to the two countries with majority Greek population, Greece and Cyprus.

=== Katharevousa ===
Katharévousa (Καθαρεύουσα) is a form of the Greek Language midway between modern and ancient forms set in train during the early nineteenth century by Greek intellectual and revolutionary leader Adamantios Korais, intended to return the Greek language closer to its ancient form. Its influence, in recent years, evolved toward a more formal role, and it came to be used primarily for official purposes such as diplomacy, politics, and other forms of official documentation. It has nevertheless had significant effects on the Greek language as it is still written and spoken today, and both vocabulary and grammatical and syntactical forms have re-entered Modern Greek via Katharevousa.

=== Dialects ===
There are a variety of dialects of the Greek language; the most notable include Cappadocian, Cretan Greek (which is closely related to most Aegean Islands&#x27; dialects), Cypriot Greek, Pontic Greek, the Griko language spoken in Southern Italy, and Tsakonian, still spoken in the modern prefecture of Arcadia and widely noted as a surviving regional dialect of Doric Greek.

== Literature ==

Greece has a remarkably rich and resilient literary tradition, extending over 2800 years and through several eras. The Classical era is that most commonly associated with Greek Literature, beginning in 800 BCE and maintaining its influence through to the beginnings of Byzantine period, whereafter the influence of Christianity began to spawn a new development of the Greek written word. The many elements of a millennia-old tradition are reflected in Modern Greek literature, including the works of the Nobel laureates Odysseus Elytis and George Seferis.

=== Ancient Greece ===

The first recorded works in the western literary tradition are the epic poems of Homer and Hesiod. Early Greek lyric poetry, as represented by poets such as Sappho and Pindar, was responsible for defining the lyric genre as it is understood today in western literature. Aesop wrote his &quot;Fables&quot; in the 6th century BC. These innovations were to have a profound influence not only on Roman poets, most notably Virgil in his epic poem on the founding of Rome, &quot;The Aeneid&quot;, but one that flourished throughout Europe.

Classical Greece is also judged the birthplace of theatre. Aeschylus introduced the ideas of dialogue and interacting characters to playwriting and in doing so, he effectively invented &quot;drama&quot;: his &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy of plays is judged his crowning achievement. Other refiners of playwriting were Sophocles and Euripides. Aristophanes, a comic playwright, defined and shaped the idea of comedy as a theatrical form.

Herodotus and Thucydides are often attributed with developing the modern study of history into a field worthy of philosophical, literary, and scientific pursuit. Polybius first introduced into study the concept of military history.

Philosophy entered literature in the dialogues of Plato, while his pupil Aristotle, in his work the &quot;Poetics&quot;, formulated the first set criteria for literary criticism. Both these literary figures, in the context of the broader contributions of Greek philosophy in the Classical and Hellenistic eras, were to give rise to idea of political Science, the study of political evolution and the critique of governmental systems.

=== Byzantine Greece ===

The growth of Christianity throughout the Greco-Roman world in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, together with the Hellenization of the Byzantine Empire of the period, would lead to the formation of a unique literary form, combining Christian, Greek and Oriental influences. In its turn, this would promote developments such as Cretan poetry, the growth of poetic satire in the Greek East and the several pre-eminent historians of the period.

=== Modern Greece ===

Modern Greek literature refers to literature written in the Greek language from the 11th century, with texts written in a language that is more familiar to the ears of Greeks today than is the language of the early Byzantine times.

The Cretan Renaissance poem &quot;Erotokritos&quot; is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this early period of modern Greek literature, and represents one of its supreme achievements. It is a verse romance written around 1600 by Vitsentzos Kornaros (1553–1613). The other major representative of the Cretan literature was Georgios Chortatzis and his most notable work was &quot;Erofili&quot;. Other plays include &quot;The Sacrifice of Abraham&quot; by Kornaros, &quot;Panoria&quot; and &quot;Katsourbos&quot; by Chortatzis, &quot;King Rodolinos&quot; by Andreas Troilos, &quot;Stathis (comedy)&quot; and &quot;Voskopoula&quot; by unknown artists.

Much later, Diafotismos was an ideological, philological, linguistic and philosophical movement among 18th century Greeks that translate the ideas and values of European Enlightenment into the Greek world. Adamantios Korais and Rigas Feraios are two of the most notable figures. In 1819, &quot;Korakistika&quot;, written by Iakovakis Rizos Neroulos, was a lampoon against the Greek intellectual Adamantios Korais and his linguistic views, who favoured the use of a more conservative form of the Greek language, closer to the ancient.

The years before the Greek Independence, the Ionian islands became the center of the Heptanese School (literature). Its main characteristics was the Italian influence, romanticism, nationalism and use of Demotic Greek. Notable representatives were Andreas Laskaratos, Andreas Kalvos, Aristotelis Valaoritis and Dionysios Solomos.

After the independence the intellectual center was transferred in Athens. A major figure of this new era was Kostis Palamas, considered &quot;national poet&quot; of Greece. He was the central figure of the Greek literary generation of the 1880s and one of the cofounders of the so-called New Athenian School (or Palamian School). Its main characteristic was the use of Demotic Greek. He was also the writer of the Olympic Hymn.

Moving into the twentieth century, the modern Greek literary tradition spans the work of Constantine P. Cavafy, considered a key figure of twentieth-century poetry, Giorgos Seferis (whose works and poems aimed to fuse the literature of Ancient and Modern Greece) and Odysseas Elytis, both of whom won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Nikos Kazantzakis is also considered a dominant figure, with works such as &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; and &quot;The Greek Passion&quot; receiving international recognition.

== Philosophy, Science, and Mathematics ==
The Greek world is widely regarded as having given birth to scientific thought using observation, thought, and development of a theory without the intervention of a supernatural force. Thales, Anaximander and Democritus were amongst those contributing significantly to the establishment of this tradition. It is also, and perhaps more commonly in the Western imagination, identified with the dawn of Western philosophy, as well as a mapping out of the natural sciences. Greek developments of mathematics continued well up until the decline of the Byzantine Empire. In the modern era Greeks continue to contribute to the fields of science, mathematics, and philosophy.

=== Ancient Greece ===

The tradition of philosophy in ancient Greece accompanied its literary development. Greek learning had a profound influence on Western and Middle Eastern civilizations. The works of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers profoundly influenced Classical thought, the Islamic Golden Age, and the Renaissance.

The Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians were very good at maths and at building geometric tombs, but they&#x27;re not famous for philosophy. Their religious explanations of things are elaborate but unconvincing in philosophical terms. Theocratic societies governed by priestly castes are usually static and monopolize thought. They insist on orthodox explanations and actively discourage independent and unconventional ideas. The Ancient Greeks invented philosophy, but no one knows why. Because of their trade across the Mediterranean Sea, they borrowed myths and mysticism as well as architecture and mathematics from their neighboring civilizations. Some Greek thinkers decided to not accept religious explanations for how the world works, an example being Xenophanes. They just thought that there just had to be some king of underlying order or logic for the way things are. This will later be given to Ancient Rome and Modern civilisation.

In medicine, doctors still refer to the Hippocratic oath, instituted by Hippocrates, regarded as foremost in laying the foundations of medicine as a science. Galen built on Hippocrates&#x27; theory of the four humours, and his writings became the foundation of medicine in Europe and the Middle East for centuries. The physicians Herophilos and Paulus Aegineta were pioneers in the study of anatomy, while Pedanius Dioscorides wrote an extensive treatise on the practice of pharmacology.

The period of Classical Greece (from 800 BC until the rise of Macedon, a Greek state in the north) is that most often associated with Greek advances in science. Thales of Miletus is regarded by many as the father of science; he was the first of the ancient philosophers to seek to explain the physical world in terms of natural rather than supernatural causes. Pythagoras was a mathematician often described as the &quot;father of numbers&quot;; it is believed that he had the pioneering insight into the numerical ratios that determine the musical scale, and the Pythagorean theorem is commonly attributed to him. Diophantus of Alexandria, in turn, was the &quot;father of algebra&quot;. Many parts of modern geometry are based on the work of Euclid, while Eratosthenes was one of the first scientific geographers, calculating the circumference of the Earth and conceiving the first maps based on scientific principles.

The Hellenistic period, following Alexander&#x27;s conquests, continued and built upon this knowledge. Hipparchus is considered the pre-eminent astronomical observer of the ancient world, and was probably the first to develop an accurate method for the prediction of solar eclipse, while Aristarchus of Samos was the first known astronomer to propose a heliocentric model of the Solar System, though the geocentric model of Ptolemy was more commonly accepted until the seventeenth century. Ptolemy also contributed substantially to cartography and to the science of optics. For his part Archimedes was the first to calculate the value of &quot;π&quot; and a geometric series, and also the earliest known mathematical physicist discovering the law of buoyancy, as well as conceiving the irrigation device known as Archimedes&#x27; screw.

=== Byzantine Greece ===


The Byzantine period remained largely a period of preservation in terms of classical Greco-Roman texts; there were, however, significant advances made in the fields of medicine and historical scholarship. Theological philosophy also remained an area of study, and there was, while not matching the achievements of preceding ages, a certain increase in the professionalism of study of these subjects, epitomized by the founding of the University of Constantinople.

Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles, the architects of the famous Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, also contributed towards mathematical theories concerning architectural form, and the perceived mathematical harmony needed to create a multi-domed structure. These ideas were to prove a heavy influence on the Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan in his creation of the Blue Mosque, also in Constantinople. Tralles in particular produced several treatises on the Natural Sciences, as well as his other forays into mathematics such as Conic Sections.

The gradual migration of Greeks from Byzantium to the Italian city states following the decline of the Byzantine Empire, and the texts they brought with them combined with the academic positions they held, was a major factor in lighting the first sparks of the Italian Renaissance.

=== Modern Greece ===
Greeks continue to contribute to science and technology in the modern world. John Argyris, a mathematician and engineer, was among the creators of the finite element method and the direct stiffness method. Constantin Carathéodory made significant contributions to the theory of functions of a real variable, calculus of variations and measure theory, credited with the introduction of several mathematical theorems. In physics, John Iliopoulos is known for the prediction of the charm quark and the proposition of the GIM mechanism, as well as the Fayet–Iliopoulos D-term formula, while Dimitri Nanopoulos is one of the principal developers of the Flipped SU(5) model.

Biologist Fotis Kafatos pioneers in the field of molecular cloning and genomics, and he was the founding president of the European Research Council. In medicine, Georgios Papanikolaou contributed heavily to the development of cervical screening inventing the Pap test, which is among the most common methods of cervical screening worldwide.

Car designer Alec Issigonis designed the groundbreaking and iconic Mini automobile, while Michael Dertouzos was amongst the pioneers of the Internet, instrumental in defining the World Wide Web Consortium and director for 27 years of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, which innovated in a variety of areas during his term. Nicholas Negroponte, is the founder of the MIT Media Lab and the One Laptop per Child project aiming to extend Internet access in the developing world. Joseph Sifakis, a computer scientist, has won a Turing Award for his pioneering work on model checking.

== Politics ==

Greece is a Parliamentary Republic with a president assuming a more ceremonial role than in some other republics, and the Prime Minister chosen from the leader of the majority party in the parliament. Greece has a codified constitution and a written Bill of Rights embedded within it. The current Prime Minister is Kyriakos Mitsotakis.

The politics of the third Hellenic Republic have been dominated by two main political parties, the conservative New Democracy and the socialist PASOK. New Democracy&#x27;s election to government in 2004 has led to various initiatives to modernize the country, such as the education university scheme above as well as labour market liberalization. Politically there has been massive opposition to some of these moves owing to a large, well organized workers&#x27; movement in Greece, which distrusts the right-wing administration and neo-liberal ideas. The population in general appears to accept many of the initiatives, reflected in governmental support; on the economic front many are so far warming to the reforms made by the administration, which have been largely rewarded with above average Eurozone growth rates. New Democracy were re-elected in September 2007.

A number of other smaller political parties exist, including the far-left Communist Party and the far-right Popular Orthodox Rally.

The political process is energetically and openly participated in by the people of Greece, while public demonstrations are a continual feature of Athenian life; however, there have been criticisms of a governmental failure to sufficiently involve minorities in political debate and hence a sidelining of their opinions. In general, politics is regarded as an acceptable subject to broach on almost every social occasion, and Greeks are often very vocal about their support (or lack of it) for certain policy proposals, or political parties themselves – this is perhaps reflected in what many consider the rather sensationalist media on both sides of the political spectrum; although this is a feature of most European tabloids.

== Public holidays and festivals ==
According to Greek Law every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. In addition, there are four obligatory, official public holidays: March 25 (&quot;Greek Independence Day&quot;), Easter Monday, August 15 (&quot;Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin&quot;) and December 25 (&quot;Christmas&quot;). Two more days, May 1 (&quot;Labour Day&quot;) and October 28 (&quot;Ohi Day&quot;), are regulated by law as optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed National Holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven National Holidays each year.

In addition to the National Holidays, there are Public Holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a &quot;Patron Saint&quot;, also called &quot;Name Day&quot;, or a &quot;Liberation Day&quot;, and at this day it is customary for schools to have a day off.

Notable festivals include Patras Carnival, Athens Festival and various local wine festivals. The city of Thessaloniki is also home of a number of festivals and events. The Thessaloniki International Film Festival is one of the most important film festivals in Southern Europe,

== Religion ==
=== Ancient Greece ===
Classical Athens may be suggested to have heralded some of the same religious ideas that would later be promoted by Christianity, such as Aristotle&#x27;s invocation of a perfect God, and Heraclitus&#x27; Logos. Plato considered there were rewards for the virtuous in the heavens and punishment for the wicked under the earth; the soul was valued more highly than the material body, and the material world was understood to be imperfect and not fully real (illustrated in Socrates&#x27;s allegory of the cave).

=== Hellenistic Greece ===

Alexander&#x27;s conquests spread classical concepts about the divine, the afterlife, and much else across the eastern Mediterranean area. Jews and early Christians alike adopted the name &quot;hades&quot; when writing about &quot;sheol&quot; in Greek. Greco-Buddhism was the cultural syncretism between Hellenistic culture and Buddhism, which developed in the Indo-Greek Kingdoms. By the advent of Christianity, the four original patriarchates beyond Rome used Greek as their church language.

=== Byzantine and Modern Greece ===

The Greek Orthodox Church, largely because of the importance of Byzantium in Greek history, as well as its role in the revolution, is a major institution in modern Greece. Its roles in society and larger role in overarching Greek culture are very important; a number of Greeks attend Church at least once a month or more and the Orthodox Easter holiday holds special significance.
The Church of Greece also retains limited political influence through the fact the Greek constitution does not have an explicit separation of Church and State; a debate suggested by more conservative elements of the church in the early 2000s about identification cards and whether religious affiliation might be added to them highlights the friction between state and church on some issues; the proposal unsurprisingly was not accepted. A widely publicised set of corruption scandals in 2004 implicating a small group of senior churchmen also increased national debate on introducing a greater transparency to the church-state relationship.

Greek Orthodox Churches dot both the villages and towns of Greece and come in a variety of architectural forms, from older Byzantine churches, to more modern white brick churches, to newer cathedral-like structures with evident Byzantine influence. Greece (as well as Cyprus), also polled as, ostensibly, one of the most religious countries in Europe, according to Eurostat; however, while the church has wide respect as a moral and cultural institution, a contrast in religious belief with Protestant northern Europe is more obvious than one with Catholic Mediterranean Europe.

Greece also has a significant minority of Muslims in Western Thrace (numbering around 100–150,000), with their places of worship guaranteed since the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. The Greek state has fully approved the construction a main mosque for the more recent Muslim community of Athens under the freedom of religion provisions of the Greek constitution.

Other religious communities living in Greece include Roman Catholics, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Protestants, Armenians, followers of the ancient Greek religion (see Hellenism), Jews and others.

== Sports ==
Greece has risen to prominence in a number of sporting areas in recent decades. Football in particular has seen a rapid transformation, with the Greece national football team winning the 2004 UEFA European Football Championship. Many Greek athletes have also achieved significant success and have won world and olympic titles in numerous sports during the years, such as basketball, wrestling, water polo, athletics, weightlifting, with many of them becoming international stars inside their sports. The successful organisation of the Athens 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games led also to the further development of many sports and has led to the creation of many World class sport venues all over Greece and especially in Athens and Thessaloniki. Greek athletes have won a total 146 medals for Greece in 15 different Olympic sports at the Summer Olympic Games, including the Intercalated Games, an achievement which makes Greece one of the top nations globally, in the world&#x27;s rankings of medals per capita.

== Symbols ==
The national colours of Greece are blue and white. The coat of arms of Greece consists of a white cross on a blue escutcheon which is surrounded by two laurel branches. The Flag of Greece is also blue and white, as defined by Law 851/1978 &quot;Regarding the National Flag&quot;. It specifies the colour of &quot;cyan&quot; (Greek: κυανό, &quot;kyano&quot;), meaning &quot;blue&quot;, so the shade of blue is ambiguous.

The Order of the Redeemer and military decoration Cross of Valour both have ribbons in the national colours.

Since it was first established, the national emblem has undergone many changes in shape and in design. The original Greek national emblem depicted the goddess Athena and an owl. At the time of Ioannis Kapodistrias, the phoenix, the symbol of rebirth, was added.

Other recognizable symbols include the (throughout the Byzantine Empire) double-headed eagle and the Vergina Sun.

<doc id="187261" wikidata="Q337121" url="?curid=187261" title="Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg">
<text>Alexander Andrew Mackay Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg, (born 23 June 1940), known as Derry Irvine, is a Scottish lawyer and politician who served as Lord Chancellor from 1997 to 2003.

He founded and headed 11 King&#x27;s Bench Walk Chambers in the 1980s, and later became a Recorder and Deputy High Court Judge. A member of the Labour Party, Irvine was appointed to the House of Lords in 1987 and served as Shadow Lord Chancellor from 1992 to 1997. He was appointed to the position in Cabinet by Prime Minister Tony Blair, his former pupil, after the 1997 election and served until his dismissal in 2003.

==Early life and education==
Alexander Andrew Mackay Irvine was born on 23 June 1940 in Inverness, Scotland to a roofer and a waitress. He was educated at the independent Hutchesons&#x27; Boys&#x27; Grammar School in Glasgow.

Irvine studied Scots law at the University of Glasgow, where he became involved in debating through the Glasgow University Dialectic Society and Glasgow University Union; He befriended Donald Dewar and John Smith through his involvement in the societies. Irvine subsequently studied English law at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Legal career==
After teaching law at the London School of Economics, Irvine was called to the Bar in 1967 and joined chambers headed by Morris Finer. He was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1978 and founded 11 King&#x27;s Bench Walk Chambers in 1981, becoming head of chambers. Irvine&#x27;s pupil barristers included Tony Blair and Cherie Booth. In the 1980s, he became a Recorder and later a Deputy High Court Judge.

== Political career ==
At the 1970 general election, Irvine unsuccessfully contested Hendon North as the Labour Party candidate. A legal adviser to the Party through the 1980s, he was awarded a life peerage as Baron Irvine of Lairg, of Lairg in the District of Sutherland, on 25 March 1987.

Irvine served as Shadow Lord Chancellor from 1992 to 1997 under Labour leaders John Smith, Margaret Beckett, and Tony Blair. After Labour&#x27;s election victory in 1997, Blair appointed him as Lord Chancellor.

During Irvine&#x27;s tenure as Lord Chancellor, he oversaw the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. In 2001, Irvine gained further responsibility for constitutional issues including human rights and freedom of information. He notably chose not to wear the officeholder&#x27;s traditional attire during most of his tenure in the role. Irvine was the last Lord Chancellor to give judgments at the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, giving a brief concurring judgment in &quot;AIB Group (UK) Ltd v Martin&quot; [2001] UKHL 63. He also gave the last reasoned judgment to be given by a Lord Chancellor, in &quot;Uratemp Ventures Ltd v Collins&quot; [2001] UKHL 43.

Blair dismissed Irvine from the Cabinet in June 2003, when he announced his intention to abolish the position of Lord Chancellor. However, the role was not abolished, but was used as a secondary title for the Justice Secretary from 2005.

=== Controversies ===
Irvine was criticised for spending £650,000 of public money to redecorate the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s residence in 1998. The cost included £59,000 in hand-printed wallpaper, and contractors had to sign the Official Secrets Act to prevent expenditure leaks. Although renovation responsibility was with the Lords authorities, Irvine defended the cost by stating that the materials would last longer than cheaper products.

He was awarded a pay rise of £22,691 in 2003, as a result of a formula designed to keep his salary ahead that of the Lord Chief Justice. However, he accepted a lower increase following public backlash to the decision.

==Personal life==
Irvine was married to Alison McNair, with whom he had a son, Alistair, and later divorced. He began his relationship with McNair during her marriage to Donald Dewar. Alistair was sentenced to 16 months in jail in the US, after pleading guilty to stalking and vandalism in 2002.

<text>Brain death is the permanent, irreversible, and complete loss of brain function, which may include cessation of involuntary activity necessary to sustain life. It differs from persistent vegetative state, in which the person is alive and some autonomic functions remain. It is also distinct from comas as long as some brain and bodily activity and function remain, and it is also not the same as the condition locked-in syndrome. A differential diagnosis can medically distinguish these differing conditions.

Brain death is used as an indicator of legal death in many jurisdictions, but it is defined inconsistently and often confused by the public. Various parts of the brain may keep functioning when others do not anymore, and the term &quot;brain death&quot; has been used to refer to various combinations. For example, although one major medical dictionary considers &quot;brain death&quot; to be synonymous with &quot;cerebral death&quot; (death of the cerebrum), the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) system defines brain death as including the brainstem. The distinctions are medically significant because, for example, in someone with a dead cerebrum but a living brainstem, spontaneous breathing may continue unaided, whereas in whole-brain death (which includes brainstem death), only life support equipment would maintain ventilation. In certain countries, patients classified as brain-dead may legally have their organs surgically removed for organ donation.

==Medicolegal history==

Differences in operational definitions of death have obvious medicolegal implications (in medical jurisprudence and medical law). Traditionally, both the legal and medical communities determined death through the permanent end of certain bodily functions in clinical death, especially respiration and heartbeat. With the increasing ability of the medical community to resuscitate people with no respiration, heartbeat, or other external signs of life, the need for another definition of death occurred, raising questions of legal death. This gained greater urgency with the widespread use of life support equipment and the rising capabilities and demand for organ transplantation.

Since the 1960s, laws governing the determination of death have been implemented in all countries that have active organ transplantation programs. The first European country to adopt brain death as a legal definition (or indicator) of death was Finland in 1971, while in the United States, the state of Kansas had enacted a similar law earlier.

An &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee at Harvard Medical School published a pivotal 1968 report to define irreversible coma. The Harvard criteria gradually gained consensus toward what is now known as brain death. In the wake of the 1976 Karen Ann Quinlan case, state legislatures in the United States moved to accept brain death as an acceptable indication of death. In 1981, a presidential commission issued a landmark report entitled &quot;Defining Death: Medical, Legal, and Ethical Issues in the Determination of Death&quot;, which rejected the &quot;higher-brain&quot; approach to death in favor of a &quot;whole-brain&quot; definition. This report formed the basis for the Uniform Determination of Death Act, since enacted in 39 states. Today, both the legal and medical communities in the US use &quot;brain death&quot; as a legal definition of death, allowing a person to be declared legally dead even if life support equipment maintains the body&#x27;s metabolic processes.

In the UK, the Royal College of Physicians reported in 1995, abandoning the 1979 claim that the tests published in 1976 sufficed for the diagnosis of brain death, and suggesting a new definition of death based on the irreversible loss of brain-stem function alone. This new definition, the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness and for spontaneous breathing, and the essentially unchanged 1976 tests held to establish that state, have been adopted as a basis of death certification for organ transplant purposes in subsequent Codes of Practice. The Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) states that the &quot;determination of brain death requires that there is unresponsive coma, the absence of brain-stem reflexes and the absence of respiratory centre function, in the clinical setting in which these findings are irreversible. In particular, there must be definite clinical or neuro-imaging evidence of acute brain pathology (e.g. traumatic brain injury, intracranial haemorrhage, hypoxic encephalopathy) consistent with the irreversible loss of neurological function.&quot; In Brazil, the Federal Council of Medicine revised its regulations in 2017, including &quot;a requirement for the patient to meet specific physiological prerequisites and for the physician to provide optimized care to the patient before starting the procedures for diagnosing brain death and to perform complementary tests, as well as the need for specific training for physicians who make this diagnosis.&quot;

In 2020, an international panel of experts, the World Brain Death Project, published a guideline that:provides recommendations for the minimum clinical standards for determination of brain death/death by neurologic criteria (BD/DNC) in adults and children with clear guidance for various clinical circumstances. The recommendations have widespread international society endorsement and can serve to guide professional societies and countries in the revision or development of protocols and procedures for determination of brain death/death by neurologic criteria, leading to greater consistency within and between countries.

==Medical criteria==
Natural movements also known as the Lazarus sign or Lazarus reflex can occur on a brain-dead person whose organs have been kept functioning by life support. The living cells that can cause these movements are not living cells from the brain or brain stem; these cells come from the spinal cord. Sometimes these body movements can cause false hope for family members.

A brain-dead individual has no clinical evidence of brain function upon physical examination. This includes no response to pain and no cranial nerve reflexes. Reflexes include pupillary response (fixed pupils), oculocephalic reflex, corneal reflex, no response to the caloric reflex test, and no spontaneous respirations.

Brain death can sometimes be difficult to differentiate from other medical states such as barbiturate overdose, acute alcohol poisoning, sedative overdose, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, coma, and chronic vegetative states. Some comatose patients can recover to pre-coma or near pre-coma level of functioning, and some patients with severe irreversible neurological dysfunction will nonetheless retain some lower brain functions, such as spontaneous respiration, despite the losses of both cortex and brain stem functionality. Such is the case with anencephaly.

Brain electrical activity can stop completely, or drop to such a low level as to be undetectable with most equipment. An EEG will therefore be flat, though this is sometimes also observed during deep anesthesia or cardiac arrest. Although in the United States a flat EEG test is not required to certify death, it is considered to have confirmatory value. In the UK it is not considered to be of value because any continuing activity it might reveal in parts of the brain above the brain stem is held to be irrelevant to the diagnosis of death on the Code of Practice criteria.

The diagnosis of brain death is often required to be highly rigorous, in order to be certain that the condition is irreversible. Legal criteria vary, but in general require neurological examinations by two independent physicians. The exams must show complete and irreversible absence of brain function (brain stem function in UK), and may include two isoelectric (flat-line) EEGs 24 hours apart (less in other countries where it is accepted that if the cause of the dysfunction is a clear physical trauma there is no need to wait that long to establish irreversibility). The patient should have a normal temperature and be free of drugs that can suppress brain activity if the diagnosis is to be made on EEG criteria.
Also, a radionuclide cerebral blood flow scan that shows complete absence of intracranial blood flow must be considered with other exams – temporary swelling of the brain, particularly within the first 72 hours, can lead to a false positive test on a patient that may recover with more time.

CT angiography is neither required nor sufficient test to make the diagnosis.

Confirmatory testing is only needed under the age of 1. For children and adults, testing is optional. Other situations possibly requiring confirmatory testing include severe facial trauma where determination of brainstem reflexes will be difficult, pre-existing pupillary abnormalities, and patients with severe sleep apnea and/or pulmonary disease. Confirmatory tests include: cerebral angiography, electroencephalography, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and cerebral scintigraphy (technetium Tc 99m exametazime). Cerebral angiography is considered the most sensitive confirmatory test in the determination of brain death.

==Organ donation==

While the diagnosis of brain death has become accepted as a basis for the certification of death for legal purposes, it is a very different state from biological death – the state universally recognized and understood as death. The continuing function of vital organs in the bodies of those diagnosed brain-dead, if mechanical ventilation and other life-support measures are continued, provides optimal opportunities for their transplantation.

When mechanical ventilation is used to support the body of a brain-dead organ donor pending a transplant into an organ recipient, the donor&#x27;s date of death is listed as the date that brain death was diagnosed.

In some countries (for instance, Spain, Finland, the United Kingdom, Portugal, France, and by 2026 Switzerland), everyone is automatically an organ donor after diagnosis of death on legally accepted criteria, although some jurisdictions (such as Singapore, Spain, the United Kingdom, France, Czech Republic, Poland and Portugal) allow opting out of the system. Elsewhere, consent from family members or next-of-kin may be required for organ donation. In New Zealand, Australia and most states in the United States, drivers are asked upon application if they wish to be registered as an organ donor.

In the United States, if the patient is at or near death, the hospital must notify a designated Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) of the details, and maintain the patient while the patient is being evaluated for suitability as a donor. The OPO searches to see if the deceased is registered as a donor, which serves as legal consent; if the deceased has not registered or otherwise noted consent (e.g., on a driver&#x27;s license), the OPO will ask the next of kin for authorization. The patient is kept on ventilator support until the organs have been surgically removed. If the patient has indicated in an advance health care directive that they do not wish to receive mechanical ventilation or has specified a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order and the patient has also indicated that they wish to donate their organs, some vital organs such as the heart and lungs may not be able to be recovered.

==Demographics==

=== United States ===
Brain death is responsible for 2% of all adult and 5% of pediatric in-hospital deaths in the United States. In a nationwide survey of pediatric intensive care units (PICU) in the United States in 2019; there were more than 3,000 pediatric brain deaths out of a total of more than 15,344 children who died in PICUs. According to a national study, &quot;brain death evaluations are performed infrequently, even in large PICUs.&quot;

<text>Arvanitika (; Arvanitika: , ; Greek: , ), also known as Arvanitic, is the variety of Albanian traditionally spoken by the Arvanites, a population group in Greece. Arvanitika was brought to southern Greece during the late Middle Ages by Albanian settlers who moved south from their homeland in present-day Albania in several waves. The dialect preserves elements of medieval Albanian, while also being significantly influenced by the Greek language. Arvanitika is today endangered, as its speakers have been shifting to the use of Greek and most younger members of the community no longer speak it.

==Name==

The name &quot;Arvanítika&quot; and its native equivalent Arbërisht are derived from the ethnonym &quot;Arvanites&quot;, which in turn comes from the toponym Arbën or Arbër (Greek: Άρβανον), which in the Middle Ages referred to a region in modern Albania. Its native equivalents (&quot;Arbërorë, Arbëreshë&quot; and others) used to be the self-designation of Albanians in general. In the past Arvanitika had sometimes been described as &quot;Graeco-Albanian&quot; and the like (e.g., Furikis, 1934); although today many Arvanites consider such names offensive, they generally identify nationally and ethnically as Greeks and not Albanians.

==Classification==

Arvanitika is part of the Tosk dialect group of Albanian, and as such closely related to the varieties spoken across southern Albania. It is also closely related to Arbëresh, the dialect of Albanian in Italy, which largely goes back to Arvanite settlers from Greece. Italian Arbëresh has retained some words borrowed from Greek (for instance &#x27;thank you&#x27;, from &quot;ευχαριστώ&quot;; &#x27;road&#x27;, from &quot;δρόμος&quot;; &#x27;yes&#x27;, from &quot;ναι&quot;, in certain villages). Italo-Arbëresh and Graeco-Arvanitika have a mutually intelligible vocabulary base, the unintelligible elements of the two dialects stem from the usage of Italian or Greek modernisms in the absence of native ones. While linguistic scholarship unanimously describes Arvanitika as a dialect of Albanian many Arvanites are reported to dislike the use of the name &quot;Albanian&quot; to designate it. 

Sociolinguistic work has described Arvanitika within the conceptual framework of &quot;ausbausprachen&quot; and &quot;abstandssprachen&quot;. In terms of &quot;abstand&quot; (objective difference of the linguistic systems), linguists&#x27; assessment of the degree of mutual intelligibility between Arvanitika and Standard Tosk range from fairly high to only partial (Ethnologue). The Ethnologue also mentions that mutual intelligibility may even be problematic between different subdialects within Arvanitika. Mutual intelligibility between Standard Tosk and Arvanitika is higher than that between the two main dialect groups within Albanian, Tosk and Gheg. See below for a sample text in the three language forms. Trudgill (2004: 5) sums up that &quot;[l]inguistically, there is no doubt that [Arvanitika] is a variety of Albanian&quot;.

In terms of &quot;ausbau&quot; (sociolinguistic &quot;upgrading&quot; towards an autonomous standard language), the strongest indicator of autonomy is the existence of a separate writing system, the Greek-based Arvanitic alphabet. A very similar system was formerly in use also by other Tosk Albanian speakers between the 16th and 18th century. However, this script is very rarely used in practice today, as Arvanitika is almost exclusively a spoken language confined to the private sphere. There is also some disagreement amongst Arvanites (as with the Aromanians) as to whether the Latin alphabet should be used to write their language. Spoken Arvanitika is internally richly diversified into sub-dialects, and no further standardization towards a common (spoken or written) Standard Arvanitika has taken place. At the same time, Arvanites do not use Standard Albanian as their standard language either, as they are generally not literate in the Latin-based standard Albanian orthography, and are not reported to use spoken-language media in Standard Albanian. In this sense, then, Arvanitika is not functionally subordinated to Standard Albanian as a &quot;dachsprache&quot; (&quot;roof language&quot;), in the way dialects of a national language within the same country usually are.

==Geographic distribution==


There are three main groups of Arvanitic settlements in Greece. Most Arvanites live in the south of Greece, across Attica, Boeotia, the Peloponnese and some neighbouring areas and islands. A second, smaller group live in the northwest of Greece, in a zone contiguous with the Albanian-speaking lands proper. A third, outlying group is found in the northeast of Greece, in a few villages in Thrace.

According to some authors, the term &quot;Arvanitika&quot; in its proper sense applies only to the southern group or to the southern and the Thracian groups together i.e. to those dialects that have been separated from the core of Albanian for several centuries. The dialects in the northwest are reported to be more similar to neighbouring Tosk dialects within Albania and to the speech of the former Cham Albanians &quot;(Çamërishte)&quot;, who used to live in the same region. These dialects are classified by Ethnologue as part of core Tosk Albanian, as opposed to &quot;Arvanitika Albanian&quot; in the narrow sense, although Ethnologue notes that the term &quot;Arvanitika&quot; is also often applied indiscriminately to both forms in Greece. In their own language, some groups in the north-west are reported to use the term &quot;Shqip&quot; (Albanian language) to refer to their own language as well as to that of Albanian nationals, and this has sometimes been interpreted as implying that they are ethnically Albanians.
The Arvanitika of southern Greece is richly sub-divided into local dialects. Sasse (1991) distinguishes as many as eleven dialect groups within that area: West Attic, Southeast Attic, Northeast-Attic-Boeotian, West Boeotian, Central Boeotian, Northeast Peloponnesian, Northwest Peloponnesian, South Peloponnesian, West Peloponnesian, Euboean, and Andriote.

Estimated numbers of speakers of Arvanitika vary widely, between 30,000 and 150,000. These figures include &quot;terminal speakers&quot; (Tsitsipis 1998) of the younger generation, who have only acquired an imperfect command of the language and are unlikely to pass it on to future generations. The number of villages with traditional Arvanite populations is estimated to more than 500. There are no monolingual Arvanitika-speakers, as all are today bilingual in Greek. Arvanitika is considered an endangered language due to the large-scale language shift towards Greek in recent decades.

==Characteristics==
Arvanitika shares many features with the Tosk dialect spoken in Southern Albania. However, it has received a great deal of influence from Greek, mostly related to the vocabulary and the phonological system. At the same time, it is reported to have preserved some conservative features that were lost in mainstream Albanian Tosk. For example, it has preserved certain syllable-initial consonant clusters which have been simplified in Standard Albanian (cf. Arvanitika &quot;gljuhë&quot; (&#x27;language/tongue&#x27;), vs. Standard Albanian &quot;gjuhë&quot; ).

In recent times, linguists have observed signs of accelerated structural convergence towards Greek and structural simplification of the language, which have been interpreted as signs of &quot;language attrition&quot;, i.e. effects of impoverishment leading towards language death.

==Writing system==

Arvanitika has rarely been written. Reportedly (GHM 1995), it has been written in both the Greek alphabet (often with the addition of the letters b, d, e and j, or diacritics, e.g.) and the Latin alphabet. Orthodox Tosk Albanians also used to write with a similar form of the Greek alphabet (e.g. ).

Texts in Arvanitika have survived in the private correspondence between Arvanites who used the dialect. Such is the correspondence of Ioannis Orlandos with Georgios Kountouriotis and other letters by members of the Kountouriotis family written in the Arvanitika of Hydra with Greek script.

In public use, Arvanitika has been used in election pamphlets of Attica and Boeotia in the 19th century. These pamphlets were published in Greek and Arvanitika for the better propagation of party lines among Arvanites and to ease communication between non-Arvanite candidates who could not speak Arvanitika and Arvanite voters.

<text>Silent Hunter is a World War II submarine combat simulation for MS-DOS, developed by Aeon Electronic Entertainment and published by Strategic Simulations in 1996. The game takes place in the Pacific War during World War II, the player commanding a submarine of the United States Navy. Most contemporary US submarines and Japanese warships are featured along with some generic merchant ships.

==Gameplay==
A single encounter generator is available, but the standard mode of play is the career mode, where the player must take their boat to patrol far behind enemy lines with the mission to search for and destroy any enemy shipping. For best success, the player should concentrate their search on shipping lanes, which may be deduced from contact reports. There are also special missions which may be assigned to a boat, such as beach reconnaissance involving photographing potential landing beaches through the periscope, and the rescue of downed airmen. Both missions were performed by the fleet submarines of World War II. The boat is actually commanded by crewing various stations in first person (no crew is visible, even though their voices are heard), which is common in the genre.

In career mode, the game begins when war against Japan is declared and continues through until August 15, 1945, when CINCPAC (Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet) issues the order to cease all offensive operations against Japan. Success against the enemy rewards the Captain (the player) with medals as appropriate to the degree of success on a given patrol. However, there is a flip side to the game. One patrol without any sinkings will result in a verbal reprimand from COMSUBPAC (Commander, Submarines, Pacific Fleet). Two consecutive patrols with no sinkings will result in the Captain being relieved of command, as happened frequently in the Silent Service, particularly in the early days of the war. If a captain is relieved of command, the game is over. Also, it is possible for Japanese destroyers to sink a submarine by gunfire on the surface, or by depth charge attack while submerged. This also ends the game.

The submarines available in the game are the boats the United States Navy had during the war. They range from the ancient S-boats, and interwar boats like the &quot;Tambor&quot; class and &quot;Sargo&quot; class, to the later wartime &quot;Gato&quot;-class, &quot;Balao&quot; class, and &quot;Tench&quot; class subs. Technological advancements become available to the player at the same time in the game that the boats in the fleet got them. These include radar, the plan position indicator radar display, and the bathythermograph.

Weaponry similarly reflects what the boats had at any given point in the war. The torpedoes range from the Mark X used by the S-boats, to the Mark XIV steam torpedo and Mark XVIII electric torpedo, to the anti-escort &quot;Cutie&quot; acoustic homing torpedo. Deck guns, which are of minor value but have their uses, similarly range from three to five inch, again as the boats received them.

== Reception ==
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator GameRankings. &quot;Silent Hunter II&quot; developer Shawn Storc stated in an interview that &quot;Silent Hunter&quot; was a commercial success with 300,000 sold units. By 1999, global sales had reached 350,000 copies. Bruce Geryk of GameSpot considered it a noteworthy hit in the simulation genre, a genre whose &quot;era had passed&quot; in his view.

&quot;Silent Hunter&quot; was nominated as &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;″s 1996 simulation of the year, although it lost to &quot;Jane&#x27;s AH-64D Longbow&quot;. The game was a finalist for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1996 &quot;Simulation Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Jane&#x27;s AH-64D Longbow&quot;.

<text>Arvanites (; Arvanitika: , or , ; Greek: , ) are a population group in Greece of Albanian origin. They are bilingual, traditionally speaking Arvanitika, an Albanian language variety, along with Greek. Their ancestors were first recorded as settlers who came to what is today southern Greece in the late 13th and early 14th century. They were the dominant population element in parts of the Peloponnese, Attica and Boeotia until the 19th century. They call themselves Arvanites (in Greek) and Arbëror (in their language). Arvanites today self-identify as Greeks as a result of a process of cultural assimilation, and do not consider themselves Albanian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trudgill/Tzavaras 1977&quot;&gt;Trudgill/Tzavaras (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Arvanitika is in a state of attrition due to language shift towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities and subsequent intermingling of the population during the 20th century.

==Names==

The name Arvanites and its equivalents are today used both in Greek (, singular form , feminine ) and in Arvanitika itself ( or ). In Standard Albanian () all three names are used. The name &quot;Arvanites&quot; and its variants are based upon the root &quot;arb/alb&quot; of the old ethnonym that was at one time used by all Albanians to refer to themselves. It refers to a geographical term, first attested in Polybius in the form of a place-name (), and then again in Byzantine authors of the 11th and 12th centuries in the form () or (), referring to a place in what is today Albania. The name &quot;Arvanites&quot; (&quot;Arbanitai&quot;) originally referred to the inhabitants of that region, and then to all Albanian-speakers. The alternative name &quot;Albanians&quot; may ultimately be etymologically related, but is of less clear origin (see Albania (toponym)). It was probably conflated with that of the &quot;Arbanitai&quot; at some stage due to phonological similarity. In later Byzantine usage, the terms &quot;Arbanitai&quot; and &quot;Albanoi&quot;, with a range of variants, were used interchangeably, while sometimes the same groups were also called by the classicising names &quot;Illyrians&quot;. In the 19th and early 20th century, &quot;Alvani&quot; (Albanians) was used predominantly in formal registers and &quot;Arvanites&quot; (Αρβανίτες) in the more popular speech in Greek, but both were used indiscriminately for both Muslim and Christian Albanophones inside and outside Greece. In Albania itself, the self-designation &quot;Arvanites&quot; had been exchanged for the new name &quot;Shqiptarë&quot; since the 15th century, an innovation that was not shared by the Albanophone migrant communities in the south of Greece. In the course of the 20th century, it became customary to use only &quot;Αλβανοί&quot; for the people of Albania, and only &quot;Αρβανίτες&quot; for the Greek-Arvanites, thus stressing the national separation between the two groups.

There is some uncertainty to what extent the term &quot;Arvanites&quot; also includes the small remaining Christian Albanophone population groups in Epirus and West Macedonia. Unlike the southern Arvanites, these speakers are reported to use the name &quot;Shqiptarë&quot; both for themselves and for Albanian nationals, although these communities also espouse a Greek national identity nowadays. The word &quot;Shqiptár&quot; is also used in a few villages of Thrace, where Arvanites migrated from the mountains of Pindus during the 19th century. However they also use the name &quot;Arvanitis&quot; speaking in Greek, while the &quot;Euromosaic&quot; (1996) reports notes that the designation &quot;Chams&quot; is today rejected by the group. The report by GHM (1995) subsumes the Epirote Albanophones under the term &quot;Arvanites&quot;, although it notes the different linguistic self-designation, on the other hand, applies the term &quot;Arvanites&quot; only to the populations of the compact Arvanitic settlement areas in southern Greece, in keeping with the self-identification of those groups. Linguistically, the Ethnologue identifies the present-day Albanian/Arvanitic dialects of Northwestern Greece (in Epirus and Lechovo) with those of the Chams, and therefore classifies them together with standard Tosk Albanian, as opposed to &quot;Arvanitika Albanian proper&quot; (i.e. southern Greek-Arvanitika). Nevertheless, it reports that in Greek the Epirus varieties are also often subsumed under &quot;Arvanitika&quot; in a wider sense. It puts the estimated number of Epirus Albanophones at 10,000. Arvanitika proper is said to include the outlying dialects spoken in Thrace.

== History ==
Arvanites in Greece originate from Albanian settlers who moved south from areas in what is today southern Albania during the Middle Ages. These Albanian movements into Greece are recorded for the first time in the late 13th and early 14th century. The reasons for this migration are not entirely clear and may be manifold. In many instances the Albanians were invited by the Byzantine and Latin rulers of the time. They were employed to re-settle areas that had been largely depopulated through wars, epidemics, and other reasons, and they were employed as soldiers. Some later movements are also believed to have been motivated to evade Islamization after the Ottoman conquest.

Groups of Albanians moved into Thessaly as early as 1268 as mercenaries of Michael Doukas. The Albanian tribes of Bua, Malakasioi and Mazaraki were described as &quot;unruly&quot; nomads living in the mountains of Thessaly in the early 14th century in Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos&#x27; &#x27;History&#x27;. They numbered approximately 12,000. Kantakouzenos describes a pact they made to serve the Byzantine Emperor and pay tribute to him ca. 1332 in exchange for using the lowland areas of Thessaly in the summer months. Albanian groups were given military holdings Fanari in the 1330s and by the end of the 14th century and the Ottoman takeover of the region, they were an integral part of the military structures of Thessaly. Two of their military leaders known in Byzantine sources as Peter and John Sebastopoulos controlled the small towns of Pharsala and Domokos. Ottoman control began in the late 14th century with the capture of Larissa in 1392-93 and consolidated in the early 15th century. Nevertheless, Ottoman control was threatened throughout this era by groups of Greeks, Albanians and Vlachs who based themselves in the mountainous areas of Thessaly.

The main waves of migration into southern Greece started from 1350, reached a peak some time during the 14th century, and ended around 1600. Albanians first reached Thessaly, then Attica, and finally the Peloponnese. One of the larger groups of Albanian settlers, amounting to 10,000, settled the Peloponnese during the reign of Theodore I Palaiologos, first in Arcadia and subsequently in the more southern regions around Messenia, Argolis, Elis and Achaea. Around 1418, a second large group arrived, possibly fleeing Aetolia, Acarnania and Arta, where Albanian political power had been defeated. After the Ottoman incursion in 1417, other groups from Albania crossed western Greece and may have infiltrated into Achaea. The settled Albanians practiced a nomadic lifestyle based on pastoralism, and spread out into small villages.
In 1453, the Albanians rose in revolt against Thomas and Demetrios Palaiologos, due to the chronic insecurity and tribute payment to the Turks; they were also joined by the local Greeks, who by then had a common leader in Manuel Kantakouzenos. Following the Ottoman conquest, many Albanians fled to Italy and settled primarily in the Arbëreshë villages of Calabria and Sicily. On the other hand, in an effort to control the remaining Albanians, during the second half of the 15th century, the Ottomans adopted favorable tax policies towards them, likely in continuation of similar Byzantine practices. This policy had been discontinued by the early 16th century. Arvanites often took part in wars on the side of the Republic of Venice against the Ottomans, between 1463 and 1715.

During the Greek War of Independence, many Arvanites played an important role on fighting on the Greek side against the Ottomans, often as national Greek heroes. With the formation of modern nations and nation-states in the Balkans, Arvanites have come to be regarded as an integral part of the Greek nation. In 1899, leading representatives of the Arvanites in Greece, including descendants of the independence heroes, published a manifesto calling their fellow Albanians outside Greece to join in the creation of a common Albanian-Greek state.

After the Greek War of Independence, Arvanites contributed greatly to the fulfilment of irredentist concept of Megali Idea which aimed to see all Greek populations in the Ottoman Empire freed and came to a halt with the end of the Greco-Turkish war in 1922.

During the 20th century, after the creation of the Albanian nation-state, Arvanites in Greece have come to dissociate themselves much more strongly from the Albanians, stressing instead their national self-identification as Greeks. At the same time, it has been suggested that many Arvanites in earlier decades maintained an assimilatory stance, leading to a progressive loss of their traditional language and a shifting of the younger generation towards Greek. 


At some times, particularly under the nationalist 4th of August Regime under Ioannis Metaxas of 1936–1941, Greek state institutions followed a policy of actively discouraging and repressing the use of Arvanitika. In the decades following World War II and the Greek Civil War, many Arvanites came under pressure to abandon Arvanitika in favour of monolingualism in the national language, and especially the archaizing Katharevousa which remained the official variant of Greek until 1976. This trend was prevalent mostly during the Greek military junta of 1967–1974.

==Demographics==
The 1460–1463 Ottoman taxation cadastre recorded the taxable population of the Peloponnese by households (), bachelors, and widows. Specifically, there were 6,551 (58.37%) Greek and 4,672 (41.63%) Albanian households, 909 (66.25%) Greek and 463 (33.75%) Albanian bachelors, and 562 (72.05%) Greek and 218 (27.95%) Albanian widows. Greeks tended to live in large villages and cities, while Albanians in small villages. Specifically, out of the 580 inhabited villages, 407 are listed as Albanian, 169 as Greek, and four as mixed; however, Greek villages had on average 3.5 times more families than Albanian ones. Many of these settlements have since been abandoned, while others have been renamed. A Venetian source of the mid-15th century estimates that 30,000 Albanians lived in the Peloponnese at that time. Throughout the Ottoman–Venetian wars, many Albanians died or were captured in service to the Venetians; at Nafpaktos, Nafplio, Argos, Methoni, Koroni and Pylos. Furthermore, 8,000 Albanian stratioti, most of them along with their families, left the Peloponnese to continue their military service under the Republic of Venice or the Kingdom of Naples.

Historian Thomas Gordon who traveled in the Kingdom of Greece in the 1830s and earlier in the 1820s described its Albanian-speaking areas: &quot;Attica, Argolis, Boeotia, Phocis, and the isles of Hydra, Spetses, Salamis, and Andros&quot; as well as &quot;several villages in Arcadia, Achaia, and Messenia&quot;. Historian George Finlay in the mid 19th century estimated the number of Albanians (Arvanites) in Greece to number about 200,000 out of approximately 1.1 million inhabitants in total based on the 1861 census. A demographic census by Alfred Philippson, based on fieldwork between 1887 and 1889, found that out of the approximately 730,000 inhabitants of the Peloponnese, and the three neighboring islands of Poros, Hydra and Spetses, Arvanites numbered 90,253, or 12.3% of the total population. In the mid-19th century, Johann Georg von Hahn estimated their number throughout Greece to be between 173,000 and 200,000. According to the , Albanian-speakers numbered 50,975 out of 2,631,952 population in total. The results of that census are unreliable, and were questioned by those responsible for it. With few exceptions, the official census data that have been published since 1907 were manipulated by the Greek state, misrepresenting the reality or avoiding to deal with ethno-linguistic diversity.

There are no official figures about the number of Arvanites in Greece today (no official data exist for ethnicity in Greece). The last official census figures available come from 1951. Since then, estimates of the numbers of Arvanites has ranged from 25,000 to 200,000. The following is a summary of the widely diverging estimates (Botsi 2003: 97):

*1928 census: 18,773 citizens self-identifying as &quot;Albanophone&quot; in all of Greece.
*1951 census: 22,736 &quot;Albanophones&quot;.
*Furikis (1934): estimated 70,000 Arvanites in Attica alone.
*Trudgill/Tzavaras (1976/77): estimated 140,000 in Attica and Boeotia together.
*Sasse (1991): estimated 50,000 Arvanitika speakers in all of Greece.
*Ethnologue, 2000: 150,000 Arvanites, living in 300 villages.
*Federal Union of European Nationalities, 1991: 95,000 &quot;Albanians of Greece&quot; (MRG 1991: 189)
*Minority Rights Group International, 1997: 200,000 Arvanites of Greece.
*Jan Markusse (2001): 25.000 Arvanites in Greece
Like the rest of the Greek population, Arvanites have been emigrating from their villages to the cities and especially to the capital Athens. This has contributed to the loss of the language in the younger generation.

Today, regions with a strong traditional presence of Arvanites are found mainly in a compact area in southeastern mainland Greece, namely across Attica (especially in Eastern Attica), southern Boeotia, the north-east of the Peloponnese, the south of the island of Euboea, the north of the island of Andros, and several islands of the Saronic Gulf including Salamis, Hydra, Poros, Agistri and Spetses. In parts of this area they formed a solid majority until about 1900. Within Attica, parts of the capital Athens and its suburbs were Arvanitic until the late 19th century. There are also settlements in some other parts of the Peloponnese, and in Phthiotis. Albanians also settled on the islands of Kea, Psara, Aegina, Kythnos, Skopelos, Ios and Samos. They would thereafter assimilate into the Greek population.

==Language use and language perception==

Arvanitika is a dialect of the Albanian language, sharing similar features primarily with other Tosk varieties. The name &quot;Arvanítika&quot; and its native equivalent Arbërisht are derived from the ethnonym &quot;Arvanites&quot;, which in turn comes from the toponym Arbëna (Greek: Άρβανα), which in the Middle Ages referred to a region in what is today Albania. Its native equivalents (&quot;Arbërorë, Arbëreshë&quot; and others) used to be the self-designation of Albanians in general.

While Arvanitika was commonly called &quot;Albanian&quot; in Greece until the 20th century, the wish of Arvanites to express their ethnic identification as Greeks has led to a stance of rejecting the identification of the language with Albanian as well. In recent times, Arvanites had only very imprecise notions about how related or unrelated their language was to Albanian. Since Arvanitika is almost exclusively a spoken language, Arvanites also have no practical affiliation with the Standard Albanian language used in Albania, as they do not use this form in writing or in media. The question of linguistic closeness or distance between Arvanitika and Albanian has come to the forefront especially since the early 1990s, when a large number of Albanian immigrants began to enter Greece and came into contact with local Arvanitic communities.

Since the 1980s, there have been some organized efforts to preserve the cultural and linguistic heritage of Arvanites. The largest organisation promoting Arvanitika is the &quot;Arvanitic League of Greece&quot; ().

Arvanitika is currently considered in danger of extinction due to it having no legal status in Greece. The language is also not available at any level of the educational system in Greece. Social changes, government policies, and public indifference have also contributed to the decline of the language.

==Intercommunity relations==
Arvanites were regarded as ethnically distinct from the Greeks until the 19th century. Amongst the Arvanites, this difference was expressed in words such as &quot;shkljira&quot; for a Greek person and &quot;shkljerishtë&quot; for the Greek language that had until recent decades negative overtones. These words in Arvanitika have their related counterpart in the pejorative term &quot;shqa&quot; used by Northern Albanians for Slavs. Ultimately these terms used amongst Albanian speakers originate from the Latin word &quot;sclavus&quot; which contained the traditional meaning of &quot;the neighbouring foreigner&quot;.

With participation in the Greek War of Independence and the Greek Civil War, this has led to increasing assimilation amongst the Arvanites. The common Christian Orthodox religion they shared with the rest of the local population was one of the main reasons that led to their assimilation. Although sociological studies of Arvanite communities still used to note an identifiable sense of a special &quot;ethnic&quot; identity among Arvanites, the authors did not identify a sense of &#x27;belonging to Albania or to the Albanian nation&#x27;. Many Arvanites find the designation &quot;Albanians&quot; offensive as they identify nationally and ethnically as Greeks and not Albanians. Jacques Lévy describes the Arvanites as &quot;Albanian speakers who were integrated into Greek national identity as early as the first half of the nineteenth century and who in no way consider themselves as an ethnic minority&quot;.

Relations between Arvanites and other Albanian speaking populations have varied over time. During the onset of the Greek war of Independence, Arvanites fought alongside Greek revolutionaries and against Muslim Albanians. For example Arvanites participated in the 1821 Tripolitsa massacre of Muslim Albanians, while some Muslim Albanian speakers in the region of Bardounia remained after the war, converting to Orthodoxy. In recent times, Arvanites have expressed mixed opinions towards Albanian immigrants within Greece. Negative views are perceptions that Albanian immigrants are &quot;communists&quot; arriving from a &quot;backward country&quot;, or an opportune people with questionable morals, behaviors and a disrespect for religion. Other Arvanites during the late 1980s and early 1990s expressed solidarity with Albanian immigrants, due to linguistic similarities and being politically leftist. Relations too between Arvanites and other Orthodox Albanian speaking communities such as those of Greek Epirus are mixed, as they are distrusted regarding religious matters due to a past Albanian Muslim population living amongst them.

Amongst the wider Greek speaking population however, the Arvanites and their language Arvanitika were viewed in past times in a derogatory manner. These views contributed toward shaping negative attitudes held by Arvanites regarding their language and thereby increasing assimilation. In post-dictatorial Greece, the Arvanites have rehabilitated themselves within Greek society through for example the propagation of the Pelasgian theory regarding Arvanite origins. The theory created a counter discourse that aimed to give the Arvanites a positive image in Greek history by claiming the Arvanites as the ancestors and relations of contemporary Greeks and their culture. The Arvanite revival of the Pelasgian theory has also been recently borrowed by other Albanian speaking populations within and from Albania in Greece to counter the negative image of their communities. However, this theory has been rejected by modern scholars and it is seen as a myth.

In the 1990s, the Albanian president Sali Berisha raised a question about an Albanian minority in Greece, but the Arvanite cultural associations reacted angrily to his statement.

==Arvanitic culture==

===Fara===
&quot;Fara&quot; (, means &quot;seed&quot;, &quot;descendants&quot; in Albanian, from Proto-Albanian &quot;*pʰarā&quot;) is a descent model, similar to the Albanian tribal system of &quot;fis&quot;. Arvanites were organised in phares (φάρες) mostly during the reign of the Ottoman Empire. The &quot;apical ancestor&quot; was a warlord and the phara was named after him. In an Arvanitic village, each phara was responsible to keep genealogical records (see also registry offices), that are preserved until today as historical documents in local libraries. Usually, there were more than one phares in an Arvanitic village and sometimes they were organised in phratries that had conflicts of interest. Those phratries didn&#x27;t last long, because each leader of a phara desired to be the leader of the phratry and would not be led by another.

===Role of women===

Women held a relatively strong position in traditional Arvanitic society. Women had a say in public issues concerning their phara, and also often bore arms. Widows could inherit the status and privileges of their husbands and thus acquire leading roles within a &quot;fara&quot;, as did, for instance, Laskarina Bouboulina.

===Arvanitic songs===
Traditional Arvanite folk songs offer valuable information about social values and ideals of Arvanitic societies.

===Dress===

The traditional clothing of Arvanites included distinctive attire that sometimes identified them in past times as Arvanites from other neighbouring populations. Arvanite males on the Greek mainland wore the &quot;fustanella&quot;, a pleated like skirt garment or kilt, while those who lived on some Aegean islands wore baggy breeches of the seafaring Greeks.

Arvanite women were known for wearing a chemise shirt that was heavily embroidered. They also wore a heavily embroidered &quot;foundi&quot; or gown like garment that was heavily embroidered in silk and on the mainland the &quot;sigouni&quot;, a woolen thick white coat. On the Aegean islands, Arvanite women wore silk gowns with Turkish influences. Terms for Arvanite female clothing were in Arvanitika rather than in Greek.

<text>Silent Hunter II is a 2001 World War II U-boat combat simulation published by Ubi Soft for PCs with Windows 95/98/ME.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Silent Hunter II&quot; gives the player the command of German U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The game offers single-player missions and multiplayer gameplay. The single-missions include sinking HMS &quot;Laurentic&quot; and HMS &quot;Patroclus&quot; as , avoiding being sunk by as , sinking as , Operation Drumbeat against American shipping, retrieving the war diary from the , the action in Tarrafal Bay, saving the German supply ship &quot;Python&quot; from &#x27; and attacking a task force as as the last act of the Battle of the Atlantic. The campaign, which has the player being sent notes from Admiral Dönitz, spans 21 missions from the start of the war in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945, and includes attacking fleeing Polish navy destroyers during the invasion of Poland, hunting British shipping off the English coast, penetration into Scapa Flow, assisting in the invasion of Norway, Blitzkrieg and Dunkirk evacuation (&quot;Dunkirk little ship&quot; &quot;Sundowner&quot; appears in this mission), then battling in the North Atlantic, before passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to La Spezia, severing the British lifeline to Malta, Operation Drumbeat, attacking in the Caribbean, attacking Arctic convoys to the Allies ultimately gaining the upper hand in the Mid-Atlantic gap, repelling the D-Day invasion and finally escaping to Buenos Aires, Argentina at the end of the war, whereupon Dönitz sends a final message.

German war veteran and U-boat commander Erich Topp was one of the game&#x27;s technical advisers, and a series of interviews with him appears in the game.

&quot;Silent Hunter II&quot; was developed with multi-player support as a notable feature. Players were able to connect with other players, and engage in sub vs. sub combat. Furthermore, connectivity to the separate game &quot;Destroyer Command&quot; (also released by Ubisoft) was available, which enabled sub and surface ship combat.

&quot;Silent Hunter II&quot; was first announced in 1999, and originally developed by Aeon Electronic Entertainment, the developers of &quot;Silent Hunter&quot;, but they had to leave the project unfinished, and Ultimation Inc. finished it. After considerable delays it was released in November 2001 after three years of work.

After release, instability with the multiplayer feature was found to be commonplace, yet Ubisoft never resolved this issue by releasing another official patch. While in 2002 Ubisoft had ended the official support, they authorized and enabled the game&#x27;s community at Subsim.com to fix the game themselves by giving them the source code. The fan community raised over $7000 for an unofficial patch development project called &quot;Projekt Messerwetzer&quot; which ultimately fixed the issues. Since then, unofficial expansion packs like the World War II Pacific war theatre-based total conversation &quot;Pacific Aces&quot; were released by community.

In June 2009, after many years of commercial non-availability, the game was re-released on the digital distributor gog.com.

== Reception ==
&quot;Silent Hunter II&quot; received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. A &quot;Subsim&quot; review rated &quot;Silent Hunter II&quot; 80/100 in 2005 and named it &quot;the new WWII subsim benchmark&quot;.

<doc id="187269" wikidata="Q38058796" url="?curid=187269" title="Extinct language">
<text>An extinct language or dead language is a language with no living native speakers. A dormant language is a dead language that still serves as a symbol of ethnic identity to an ethnic group; these languages are often undergoing a process of revitalisation. Languages that have first-language speakers are known as modern or living languages to contrast them with dead languages, especially in educational contexts.

Languages have typically become extinct as a result of the process of cultural assimilation leading to language shift, and the gradual abandonment of a native language in favor of a foreign &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

As of the 2000s, a total of roughly 7,000 natively spoken languages existed worldwide. Most of these are minor languages in danger of extinction; one estimate published in 2004 expected that some 90% of the currently spoken languages will have become extinct by 2050.

==Language death==
Normally the transition from a spoken to an extinct language occurs when a language undergoes language death by being directly replaced by a different one. For example, many Native American languages were replaced by Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish as a result of European colonization of the Americas.

After a language has ceased to be spoken as a first language, it may continue to exist as learned, second language, such as Latin.

In a view that prioritizes written representation over natural language acquisition and evolution, historical languages with living descendants that have undergone significant language change may be considered &quot;extinct&quot;, especially in cases where they did not leave a corpus of literature or liturgy that remained in widespread use (see corpus language), as is the case with Old English or Old High German relative to their contemporary descendants, English and German. This is accomplished by periodizing English and German as Old; for Latin, an apt clarifying adjective is Classical, which also normally includes designation of high or formal register.

Minor languages are endangered mostly due to economic and cultural globalization, cultural assimilation, and development. With increasing economic integration on national and regional scales, people find it easier to communicate and conduct business in the dominant lingua francas of world commerce: English, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, and French.

In their study of contact-induced language change, American linguists Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman (1991) stated that in situations of cultural pressure (where populations are forced to speak a dominant language), three linguistic outcomes may occur: first – and most commonly – a subordinate population may shift abruptly to the dominant language, leaving the native language to a sudden linguistic death. Second, the more gradual process of language death may occur over several generations. The third and most rare outcome is for the pressured group to maintain as much of its native language as possible, while borrowing elements of the dominant language&#x27;s grammar (replacing all, or portions of, the grammar of the original language). A now disappeared language may leave a substantial trace as a substrate in the language that replaces it. There have, however, also been cases where the language of higher prestige did not displace the native language but left a superstrate influence. The French language for example shows evidence both of a Celtic substrate and a Frankish superstrate.

Institutions such as the education system, as well as (often global) forms of media such as the Internet, television, and print media play a significant role in the process of language loss. For example, when people migrate to a new country, their children attend school in the country, and the schools are likely to teach them in the majority language of the country rather than their parents&#x27; native language.

Language death can also be the explicit goal of government policy. For example, part of the &quot;kill the Indian, save the man&quot; policy of American Indian boarding schools and other measures was to prevent Native Americans from transmitting their native language to the next generation and to punish children who spoke the language of their culture of origin. The French vergonha policy likewise had the aim of eradicating minority languages.

==Language revival==

Language revival is the attempt to re-introduce an extinct language in everyday use by a new generation of native speakers. The optimistic neologism &quot;sleeping beauty languages&quot; has been used to express such a hope, though scholars usually refer to such languages as dormant.

In practice, this has only happened on a large scale successfully once: the revival of the Hebrew language. Hebrew had survived for millennia since the Babylonian exile as a liturgical language, but not as a vernacular language. The revival of Hebrew has been largely successful due to extraordinarily favourable conditions, notably the creation of a nation state (modern Israel in 1948) in which it became the official language, as well as Eliezer Ben-Yehuda&#x27;s extreme dedication to the revival of the language, by creating new words for the modern terms Hebrew lacked.

Revival attempts for minor extinct languages with no status as a liturgical language typically have more modest results. The Cornish language revival has proven at least partially successful: after a century of effort there are 3,500 claimed native speakers, enough for UNESCO to change its classification from &quot;extinct&quot; to &quot;critically endangered&quot;. A Livonian language revival movement to promote the use of the Livonian language has managed to train a few hundred people to have some knowledge of it.

<doc id="187271" wikidata="Q92601" url="?curid=187271" title="Nicholas Negroponte">
<text>Nicholas Negroponte (born December 1, 1943) is a Greek American architect. He is the founder and chairman Emeritus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Media Lab, and also founded the One Laptop per Child Association (OLPC). Negroponte is the author of the 1995 book &quot;Being Digital&quot; translated into more than forty languages.

==Early life==
Negroponte was born to Dimitrios Negropontis (), a Greek shipping magnate, competitive alpine skier and member of the Negroponte family. He grew up in New York City&#x27;s Upper East Side. 
He has three brothers. His elder one, John Negroponte, is the former United States Deputy Secretary of State. Michel Negroponte is an Emmy Award-winning filmmaker. George Negroponte is an artist and was President of the Drawing Center from 2002 to 2007.

He attended Buckley School in New York, Fay School in Massachusetts, Le Rosey in Switzerland, and The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, from which he graduated in 1961. Subsequently, he studied at MIT as both an undergraduate and graduate student in Architecture where his research focused on issues of computer-aided design. 

Yona Friedman recalls having met Negroponte in 1964 when he was still a student at MIT, where he had discussed with Friedman his idea for an &quot;Architecture Machine&quot;. The architecture machine is considered by Negroponte to be a machine collaborator, who engages in an ongoing architectural design process with a human peer. Both machine and human participants engage in a process of mutual training and growth with each other, in order to harness the interactive potential found in peer-to-peer collaborations during an architectural design process with man and machine instead. 

He earned a master&#x27;s degree in architecture from MIT in 1966. Despite his accomplished academic career, Negroponte has spoken publicly about his dyslexia and his difficulty in reading.

==Career==

===MIT===
Negroponte later joined the faculty of MIT in 1966. For several years thereafter he divided his teaching time between MIT and several visiting professorships at Yale, Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley. He also during 1966, had a role with IBM which could potentially provide funding for research to find means of using computers to help architects, planners and designers. He attended Avery Johnson&#x27;s lab and seminars at the MIT Sloan school. He eventually met Warren Brodey, who Negroponte described as being “one of the earliest and most important influences”. According to Evgeny Morozov, it was through Brodey that the ideas of &quot;soft architectures&quot; and &quot;intelligent environments&quot; became established in Negroponte&#x27;s thinking.

In 1967, Negroponte founded MIT&#x27;s Architecture Machine Group, a combination lab and think tank which studied new approaches to human–computer interaction. The Architecture Machine Group was primarily concerned in addressing the potential of computers in architecture. Negroponte argued during this period that computer aided design was only making activities such as architecture &quot;faster&quot;, and that the underlying spirit of the architectural machine group would be to explore the various possibilities for generating collaborating machines for architectural design. The group took funding from DARPA and other parts of The Pentagon to explore early research in human-computer interaction and virtual reality. The contents of the research from the lab were composed into two books: &quot;The Architecture Machine: Towards a More Human Environment&quot; (1973), and &quot;Soft Architecture Machines&quot; (1976). Participants in the group included the cybernetician Gordon Pask, who visited Negroponte as a consultant and whose article &quot;Aspects of Machine Intelligence&quot; became the introduction to the section on machine intelligence in &quot;Soft Architecture Machines&quot;.

In 1985, Negroponte created the MIT Media Lab with Jerome B. Wiesner. As director, he developed the lab into a laboratory for new media and a high-tech playground for investigating the human–computer interface. Negroponte also became a proponent of intelligent agents and personalized electronic newspapers, for which he popularized the term the Daily Me.

===&quot;Wired&quot;===
In 1992, Negroponte was the first investor in &quot;Wired Magazine&quot;. From 1993 to 1998, he contributed a monthly column to the magazine in which he reiterated a basic theme: &quot;Move bits, not atoms.&quot;

Negroponte expanded many of the ideas from his &quot;Wired&quot; columns into a bestselling book &quot;Being Digital&quot; (1995), which made famous his forecasts on how the interactive world, the entertainment world and the information world would eventually merge. &quot;Being Digital&quot; was a bestseller and was translated into some forty languages. Negroponte is a digital optimist who believed that computers would make life better for everyone. However, critics such as Cass Sunstein have criticised his techno-utopian ideas for failing to consider the historical, political and cultural realities with which new technologies should be viewed.

In the 1980s, Negroponte predicted that wired technologies such as telephones would become unwired by using airwaves instead of wires or fiber optics, and that unwired technologies such as televisions would become wired—a prediction commonly referred to as the Negroponte switch.

==Later career==
In 2000, Negroponte stepped down as director of the Media Lab as Walter Bender took over as executive director. However, Negroponte retained the role of laboratory chairman. When Frank Moss was appointed director of the lab in 2006, Negroponte stepped down as lab chairman to focus more fully on his work with One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) although he retains his appointment as professor at MIT (Professor Post-Tenure of Media Arts and Sciences).
In November 2005, at the World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis, Negroponte unveiled the concept of a $100 laptop computer, The Children&#x27;s Machine, designed for students in the developing world. The price has increased to US$180, however. The project was a part of a broader program by One Laptop Per Child, a nonprofit organization started by Negroponte and other Media Lab faculty to extend Internet access in developing countries.

Negroponte is an angel investor and has invested in over 30 startup companies over the last 30 years, including Zagats, Wired, Ambient Devices, Skype and Velti. He has sat on several boards, including Motorola and Velti. He is also on the advisory board of TTI/Vanguard. 

In August 2007, he was appointed to a five-member special committee with the objective of assuring the continued journalistic and editorial integrity and independence of the Wall Street Journal and other Dow Jones &amp; Company publications and services. The committee was formed as part of the merger of Dow Jones with News Corporation. Negroponte&#x27;s fellow founding committee members are Louis Boccardi, Thomas Bray, Jack Fuller, and the late former Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn.

===Epstein funding comments===
In response to the controversy of the MIT Media Lab accepting funding from Jeffrey Epstein five years after Epstein&#x27;s conviction for sex trafficking minors, Negroponte told MIT staff, &quot;If you wind back the clock, I would still say, &#x27;Take it.&#x27;&quot;

Negroponte said that in the fund-raising world these types of occurrences were not out of the ordinary, and they should not be reason enough to cut off business relationships.

<doc id="187272" wikidata="Q1186065" url="?curid=187272" title="Democratic deficit">
<text>A democratic deficit (or democracy deficit) occurs when ostensibly-democratic organizations or institutions (particularly governments) fall short of fulfilling the principles of democracy in their practices or operation. Representative and linked parliamentary integrity have become widely discussed. The qualitative expression of the democratic deficit is the difference between the democracy indices of a country from the highest possible values.

The phrase &quot;democratic deficit&quot; is cited as first being used by the Young European Federalists in their &quot;Manifesto&quot; in 1977, which was drafted by Richard Corbett.
It was also used by David Marquand in 1979, referring to the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the European Union.

== Voting rights ==
The term &quot;democratic deficit&quot; is commonly used to refer to situations where territories under the jurisdiction of a sovereign state do not enjoy equal participation in electing representatives that legislate for them. Examples include:
* : Three external territories of Australia (Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island), have laws from the states of Western Australia or New South Wales apply to them but cannot vote in the elections of those states.
* : Three constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba, Curacao and Sint Maarten) have no representation in the States General of the Netherlands.
* : Eleven inhabited British Overseas Territories and three Crown Dependencies (Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man) have no representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
* : The District of Columbia and five inhabited territories of the United States (Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and U.S. Virgin Islands), only have non-voting representation in the United States House of Representatives, and none in the United States Senate.

Tokelau, a dependent territory of New Zealand with no representation in the New Zealand Parliament, could also be said to be in a similar position. However, in practice, no legislation from New Zealand is extended to Tokelau without the territory&#x27;s consent.

== Multinational organizations ==
Some scholars have argued that the ratification of European Union treaties by repeated referendums, such as those held in Ireland for the Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon, is also associated with a democratic deficit. National parliaments have given up power to the centralised European Parliament. As European Union citizens elect those who make up Council who then elect those become that Commissioners, there is a real fear it is too distant for many citizens. Often, EU elections are treated as second-order elections; with protest votes more common during national and local elections, example of this would be the success of anti-immigration parties such as Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy. Another problem in the EU is that voters vote more on the basis of national issues in the European Parliament elections and that the election is more used by voters to punish their government in the middle of their term. There is also insufficiently a European public opinion or European public sphere that votes against or rewards European politicians. Another problem is the big influence of lobbying groups on European institutions. The European Parliament was created to give more democratic legitimacy to the EU but shares legislative power with the Council of the European Union, which has one vote per country.

The UN Parliamentary Assembly has been proposed as a way of ameliorating a democratic deficit within the United Nations.

== Other examples ==

A study of the Columbia University concluded that policy in US states is congruent with the majority only half the time. The largest influences were found to be legislative professionalization, term limits, and issue salience. Partisanship and interest groups affect the ideological balance of incongruence more than the aggregate degree thereof. Policy is found to be overresponsive to ideology and party, which leads policy to be polarized relative to state electorates. The large differences in voter turnout during US elections for various income groups are also seen as a problem for the functioning of democracy. Sanford Levinson argues that campaign financing and gerrymandering are seen as serious problems for democracy, but another of the root causes of the American democratic deficit lies in the US Constitution itself. For example, there is a lack of representation in the US Senate for highly populated states such as California as all states in the United States regardless of population receive 2 seats in the Senate.

<text>Han unification is an effort by the authors of Unicode and the Universal Character Set to map multiple character sets of the Han characters of the so-called CJK languages into a single set of unified characters. Han characters are a feature shared in common by written Chinese (hanzi), Japanese (kanji), Korean (hanja) and Vietnamese (chữ Hán).

Modern Chinese, Japanese and Korean typefaces typically use regional or historical variants of a given Han character. In the formulation of Unicode, an attempt was made to unify these variants by considering them as allographsdifferent glyphs representing the same &quot;grapheme&quot; or orthographic unit hence, &quot;Han unification&quot;, with the resulting character repertoire sometimes contracted to Unihan.

Nevertheless, many characters have regional variants assigned to different code points, such as Traditional (U+500B) versus Simplified (U+4E2A).

==Rationale and controversy==
The Unicode Standard details the principles of Han unification.
The Ideographic Research Group (IRG), made up of experts from the Chinese-speaking countries, North and South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and other countries, is responsible for the process.

One rationale was the desire to limit the size of the full Unicode character set, where CJK characters as represented by discrete ideograms may approach or exceed 100,000 characters. Version 1 of Unicode was designed to fit into 16 bits and only 20,940 characters (32%) out of the possible 65,536 were reserved for these CJK Unified Ideographs. Unicode was later extended to 21 bits allowing many more CJK characters (97,680 are assigned, with room for more).

An article hosted by IBM attempts to illustrate part of the motivation for Han unification:

In fact, the three ideographs for &quot;one&quot; (, , or ) are encoded separately in Unicode, as they are not considered national variants. The first is the common form in all three countries, while the second and third are used on financial instruments to prevent tampering (they may be considered variants).

However, Han unification has also caused considerable controversy, particularly among the Japanese public, who, with the nation&#x27;s literati, have a history of protesting the culling of historically and culturally significant variants. (See . Today, the list of characters officially recognized for use in proper names continues to expand at a modest pace.)

In 1993, the Japan Electronic Industries Development Association (JEIDA) published a pamphlet titled &quot;&quot; (We are feeling anxious for the future character encoding system ), summarizing major criticism against the Han Unification approach adopted by Unicode.

===Graphemes versus glyphs===
A grapheme is the smallest abstract unit of meaning in a writing system. Any grapheme has many possible glyph expressions, but all are recognized as the same grapheme by those with reading and writing knowledge of a particular writing system. Although Unicode typically assigns characters to code points to express the graphemes within a system of writing, the Unicode Standard (section 3.4 D7) cautions:
However, this quote refers to the fact that some graphemes are composed of several graphic elements or &quot;characters&quot;. So, for example, the character
 combined with (generating the combination &quot;å&quot;) might be understood by a user as a single grapheme while being composed of multiple Unicode abstract characters. In addition, Unicode also assigns some code points to a small number (other than for compatibility reasons) of formatting characters, whitespace characters, and other abstract characters that are not graphemes, but instead used to control the breaks between lines, words, graphemes and grapheme clusters. With the unified Han ideographs, the Unicode Standard makes a departure from prior practices in assigning abstract characters not as graphemes, but according to the underlying meaning of the grapheme: what linguists sometimes call sememes. This departure therefore is not simply explained by the oft quoted distinction between an abstract character and a glyph, but is more rooted in the difference between an abstract character assigned as a grapheme and an abstract character assigned as a sememe. In contrast, consider ASCII&#x27;s unification of punctuation and diacritics, where graphemes with widely different meanings (for example, an apostrophe and a single quotation mark) are unified because the glyphs are the same. For Unihan the characters are not unified by their appearance, but by their definition or meaning.

For a grapheme to be represented by various glyphs means that the grapheme has glyph variations that are usually determined by selecting one font or another or using glyph substitution features where multiple glyphs are included in a single font. Such glyph variations are considered by Unicode a feature of rich text protocols and not properly handled by the plain text goals of Unicode. However, when the change from one glyph to another constitutes a change from one grapheme to another—where a glyph cannot possibly still, for example, mean the same grapheme understood as the small letter &quot;a&quot;—Unicode separates those into separate code points. For Unihan the same thing is done whenever the abstract meaning changes, however rather than speaking of the abstract meaning of a grapheme (the letter &quot;a&quot;), the unification of Han ideographs assigns a new code point for each different meaning—even if that meaning is expressed by distinct graphemes in different languages. Although a grapheme such as &quot;ö&quot; might mean something different in English (as used in the word &quot;coördinated&quot;) than it does in German (as used in the word &quot;schön&quot;), it is still the same grapheme and can be easily unified so that English and German can share a common abstract Latin writing system (along with Latin itself). This example also points to another reason that &quot;abstract character&quot; and grapheme as an abstract unit in a written language do not necessarily map one-to-one. In English the combining diaeresis, &quot;¨&quot;, and the &quot;o&quot; it modifies may be seen as two separate graphemes, whereas in languages such as Swedish, the letter &quot;ö&quot; may be seen as a single grapheme. Similarly in English the dot on an &quot;i&quot; is understood as a part of the &quot;i&quot; grapheme whereas in other languages, such as Turkish, the dot may be seen as a separate grapheme added to the dotless &quot;ı&quot;.

To deal with the use of different graphemes for the same Unihan sememe, Unicode has relied on several mechanisms: especially as it relates to rendering text. One has been to treat it as simply a font issue so that different fonts might be used to render Chinese, Japanese or Korean. Also font formats such as OpenType allow for the mapping of alternate glyphs according to language so that a text rendering system can look to the user&#x27;s environmental settings to determine which glyph to use. The problem with these approaches is that they fail to meet the goals of Unicode to define a consistent way of encoding multilingual text.

So rather than treat the issue as a rich text problem of glyph alternates, Unicode added the concept of variation selectors, first introduced in version 3.2 and supplemented in version 4.0. While variation selectors are treated as combining characters, they have no associated diacritic or mark. Instead, by combining with a base character, they signal the two character sequence selects a variation (typically in terms of grapheme, but also in terms of underlying meaning as in the case of a location name or other proper noun) of the base character. This then is not a selection of an alternate glyph, but the selection of a grapheme variation or a variation of the base abstract character. Such a two-character sequence however can be easily mapped to a separate single glyph in modern fonts. Since Unicode has assigned 256 separate variation selectors, it is capable of assigning 256 variations for any Han ideograph. Such variations can be specific to one language or another and enable the encoding of plain text that includes such grapheme variations.

===Unihan &quot;abstract characters&quot;===
Since the Unihan standard encodes &quot;abstract characters&quot;, not &quot;glyphs&quot;, the graphical artifacts produced by Unicode have been considered temporary technical hurdles, and at most, cosmetic. However, again, particularly in Japan, due in part to the way in which Chinese characters were incorporated into Japanese writing systems historically, the inability to specify a particular variant was considered a significant obstacle to the use of Unicode in scholarly work. For example, the unification of &quot;grass&quot; (explained above), means that a historical text cannot be encoded so as to preserve its peculiar orthography. Instead, for example, the scholar would be required to locate the desired glyph in a specific typeface in order to convey the text as written, defeating the purpose of a unified character set. Unicode has responded to these needs by assigning variation selectors so that authors can select grapheme variations of particular ideographs (or even other characters).

Small differences in graphical representation are also problematic when they affect legibility or belong to the wrong cultural tradition. Besides making some Unicode fonts unusable for texts involving multiple &quot;Unihan languages&quot;, names or other orthographically sensitive terminology might be displayed incorrectly. (Proper names tend to be especially orthographically conservative—compare this to changing the spelling of one&#x27;s name to suit a language reform in the US or UK.) While this may be considered primarily a graphical representation or rendering problem to be overcome by more artful fonts, the widespread use of Unicode would make it difficult to preserve such distinctions. The problem of one character representing semantically different concepts is also present in the Latin part of Unicode. The Unicode character for a curved apostrophe is the same as the character for a right single quote (’). On the other hand, the capital Latin letter A is not unified with the Greek letter Α or the Cyrillic letter А. This is, of course, desirable for reasons of compatibility, and deals with a much smaller alphabetic character set.

While the unification aspect of Unicode is controversial in some quarters for the reasons given above, Unicode itself does now encode a vast number of seldom-used characters of a more-or-less antiquarian nature.

Some of the controversy stems from the fact that the very decision of performing Han unification was made by the initial Unicode Consortium, which at the time was a consortium of North American companies and organizations (most of them in California), but included no East Asian government representatives. The initial design goal was to create a 16-bit standard, and Han unification was therefore a critical step for avoiding tens of thousands of character duplications. This 16-bit requirement was later abandoned, making the size of the character set less of an issue today.

The controversy later extended to the internationally representative ISO: the initial CJK Joint Research Group (CJK-JRG) favored a proposal (DIS 10646) for a non-unified character set, &quot;which was thrown out in favor of unification with the Unicode Consortium&#x27;s unified character set by the votes of American and European ISO members&quot; (even though the Japanese position was unclear). Endorsing the Unicode Han unification was a necessary step for the heated ISO 10646/Unicode merger.

Much of the controversy surrounding Han unification is based on the distinction between glyphs, as defined in Unicode, and the related but distinct idea of graphemes. Unicode assigns abstract characters (graphemes), as opposed to glyphs, which are a particular visual representations of a character in a specific typeface. One character may be represented by many distinct glyphs, for example a &quot;g&quot; or an &quot;a&quot;, both of which may have one loop (, ) or two (, ). Yet for a reader of Latin script based languages the two variations of the &quot;a&quot; character are both recognized as the same grapheme. Graphemes present in national character code standards have been added to Unicode, as required by Unicode&#x27;s Source Separation rule, even where they can be composed of characters already available. The national character code standards existing in CJK languages are considerably more involved, given the technological limitations under which they evolved, and so the official CJK participants in Han unification may well have been amenable to reform.

Unlike European versions, CJK Unicode fonts, due to Han unification, have large but irregular patterns of overlap, requiring language-specific fonts. Unfortunately, language-specific fonts also make it difficult to access a variant which, as with the &quot;grass&quot; example, happens to appear more typically in another language style. (That is to say, it would be difficult to access &quot;grass&quot; with the four-stroke radical more typical of Traditional Chinese in a Japanese environment, which fonts would typically depict the three-stroke radical.) Unihan proponents tend to favor markup languages for defining language strings, but this would not ensure the use of a specific variant in the case given, only the language-specific font more likely to depict a character as that variant. (At this point, merely stylistic differences do enter in, as a selection of Japanese and Chinese fonts are not likely to be visually compatible.)

Chinese users seem to have fewer objections to Han unification, largely because Unicode did not attempt to unify Simplified Chinese characters with Traditional Chinese characters. (Simplified Chinese characters are used among Chinese speakers in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Singapore, and Malaysia. Traditional Chinese characters are used in Hong Kong and Taiwan (Big5) and they are, with some differences, more familiar to Korean and Japanese users.) Unicode is seen as neutral with regards to this politically charged issue, and has encoded Simplified and Traditional Chinese glyphs separately (e.g. the ideograph for &quot;discard&quot; is U+4E1F for Traditional Chinese Big5 #A5E1 and U+4E22 for Simplified Chinese GB #2210). It is also noted that Traditional and Simplified characters should be encoded separately according to Unicode Han Unification rules, because they are distinguished in pre-existing PRC character sets. Furthermore, as with other variants, Traditional to Simplified characters is not a one-to-one relationship.

===Alternatives===
There are several alternative character sets that are not encoding according to the principle of Han Unification, and thus free from its restrictions:
*CNS character set
*CCCII character set
*TRON
*&quot;Mojikyō&quot;
These region-dependent character sets are also seen as not affected by Han Unification because of their region-specific nature:
*ISO/IEC 2022 (based on sequence codes to switch between Chinese, Japanese, Korean character sets – hence without unification)
*Big5 extensions
*GCCS and its successor HKSCS
However, none of these alternative standards has been as widely adopted as Unicode, which is now the base character set for many new standards and protocols, internationally adopted, and is built into the architecture of operating systems (Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and many Unix-like systems), programming languages (Perl, Python, C#, Java, Common Lisp, APL, C, C++), and libraries (IBM International Components for Unicode (ICU) along with the Pango, Graphite, Scribe, Uniscribe, and ATSUI rendering engines), font formats (TrueType and OpenType) and so on.

In March 1989, a (B)TRON-based system was adopted by Japanese government organizations &quot;Center for Educational Computing&quot; as the system of choice for school education including compulsory education. However, in April, a report titled &quot;1989 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers&quot; from Office of the United States Trade Representative have specifically listed the system as a trade barrier in Japan. The report claimed that the adoption of the TRON-based system by the Japanese government is advantageous to Japanese manufacturers, and thus excluding US operating systems from the huge new market; specifically the report lists MS-DOS, OS/2 and UNIX as examples. The Office of USTR was allegedly under Microsoft&#x27;s influence as its former officer Tom Robertson was then offered a lucrative position by Microsoft. While the TRON system itself was subsequently removed from the list of sanction by Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 after protests by the organization in May 1989, the trade dispute caused the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to accept a request from Masayoshi Son to cancel the Center of Educational Computing&#x27;s selection of the TRON-based system for the use of educational computers. The incident is regarded as a symbolic event for the loss of momentum and eventual demise of the BTRON system, which led to the widespread adoption of MS-DOS in Japan and the eventual adoption of Unicode with its successor Windows.

===Merger of all equivalent characters===
There has not been any push for full semantic unification of all semantically linked characters, though the idea would treat the respective users of East Asian languages the same, whether they write in Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Kyūjitai Japanese, Shinjitai Japanese or Vietnamese. Instead of some variants getting distinct code points while other groups of variants have to share single code points, all variants could be reliably expressed only with metadata tags (e.g., CSS formatting in webpages). The burden would be on all those who use differing versions of , , , , whether that difference be due to simplification, international variance or intra-national variance. However, for some platforms (e.g., smartphones), a device may come with only one font pre-installed. The system font must make a decision for the default glyph for each code point and these glyphs can differ greatly, indicating different underlying graphemes.

Consequently, relying on language markup across the board as an approach is beset with two major issues. First, there are contexts where language markup is not available (code commits, plain text). Second, any solution would require every operating system to come pre-installed with many glyphs for semantically identical characters that have many variants. In addition to the standard character sets in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Kyūjitai Japanese and Shinjitai Japanese, there also exist &quot;ancient&quot; forms of characters that are of interest to historians, linguists and philologists.

Unicode&#x27;s Unihan database has already drawn connections between many characters. The Unicode database catalogs the connections between variant characters with distinct code points already. However, for characters with a shared code point, the reference glyph image is usually biased toward the Traditional Chinese version. Also, the decision of whether to classify pairs as semantic variants or z-variants is not always consistent or clear, despite rationalizations in the handbook.

So-called semantic variants of (U+4E1F) and (U+4E22) are examples that Unicode gives as differing in a significant way in their abstract shapes, while Unicode lists and as z-variants, differing only in font styling. Paradoxically, Unicode considers and to be near identical z-variants while at the same time classifying them as significantly different semantic variants. There are also cases of some pairs of characters being simultaneously semantic variants and specialized semantic variants and simplified variants: (U+500B) and (U+4E2A). There are cases of non-mutual equivalence. For example, the Unihan database entry for (U+4E80) considers (U+9F9C) to be its z-variant, but the entry for does not list as a z-variant, even though was obviously already in the database at the time that the entry for was written.

Some clerical errors led to doubling of completely identical characters such as (U+FA23) and (U+27EAF). If a font has glyphs encoded to both points so that one font is used for both, they should appear identical. These cases are listed as z-variants despite having no variance at all. Intentionally duplicated characters were added to facilitate bit-for-bit round-trip conversion. Because round-trip conversion was an early selling point of Unicode, this meant that if a national standard in use unnecessarily duplicated a character, Unicode had to do the same. Unicode calls these intentional duplications &quot;compatibility variants&quot; as with 漢 (U+FA9A) which calls (U+6F22) its compatibility variant. As long as an application uses the same font for both, they should appear identical. Sometimes, as in the case of with U+8ECA and U+F902, the added compatibility character lists the already present version of as both its compatibility variant and its z-variant. The compatibility variant field overrides the z-variant field, forcing normalization under all forms, including canonical equivalence. Despite the name, compatibility variants are actually canonically equivalent and are united in any Unicode normalization scheme and not only under compatibility normalization. This is similar to how is canonically equivalent to a pre-composed . Much software (such as the MediaWiki software that hosts Wikipedia) will replace all canonically equivalent characters that are discouraged (e.g. the angstrom symbol) with the recommended equivalent. Despite the name, CJK &quot;compatibility variants&quot; are canonically equivalent characters and not compatibility characters.

漢 (U+FA9A) was added to the database later than (U+6F22) was and its entry informs the user of the compatibility information. On the other hand, (U+6F22) does not have this equivalence listed in this entry. Unicode demands that all entries, once admitted, cannot change compatibility or equivalence so that normalization rules for already existing characters do not change.

Some pairs of Traditional and Simplified are also considered to be semantic variants. According to Unicode&#x27;s definitions, it makes sense that all simplifications (that do not result in wholly different characters being merged for their homophony) will be a form of semantic variant. Unicode classifies and as each other&#x27;s respective traditional and simplified variants and also as each other&#x27;s semantic variants. However, while Unicode classifies (U+5104) and (U+4EBF) as each other&#x27;s respective traditional and simplified variants, Unicode does not consider and to be semantic variants of each other.

Unicode claims that &quot;Ideally, there would be no pairs of z-variants in the Unicode Standard.&quot; This would make it seem that the goal is to at least unify all minor variants, compatibility redundancies and accidental redundancies, leaving the differentiation to fonts and to language tags. This conflicts with the stated goal of Unicode to take away that overhead, and to allow any number of any of the world&#x27;s scripts to be on the same document with one encoding system. Chapter One of the handbook states that &quot;With Unicode, the information technology industry has replaced proliferating character sets with data stability, global interoperability and data interchange, simplified software, and reduced development costs. While taking the ASCII character set as its starting point, the Unicode Standard goes far beyond ASCII&#x27;s limited ability to encode only the upper- and lowercase letters A through Z. It provides the capacity to encode all characters used for the written languages of the world – more than 1 million characters can be encoded. No escape sequence or control code is required to specify any character in any language. The Unicode character encoding treats alphabetic characters, ideographic characters, and symbols equivalently, which means they can be used in any mixture and with equal facility.&quot;

This leaves the option to settle on one unified reference grapheme for all z-variants, which is contentious since few outside of Japan would recognize and as equivalent. Even within Japan, the variants are on different sides of a major simplification called Shinjitai. Unicode would effectively make the PRC&#x27;s simplification of (U+4FA3) and (U+4FB6) a monumental difference by comparison. Such a plan would also eliminate the very visually distinct variations for characters like (U+76F4) and (U+96C7).

One would expect that all simplified characters would simultaneously also be z-variants or semantic variants with their traditional counterparts, but many are neither. It is easier to explain the strange case that semantic variants can be simultaneously both semantic variants and specialized variants when Unicode&#x27;s definition is that specialized semantic variants have the same meaning only in certain contexts. Languages use them differently. A pair whose characters are 100% drop-in replacements for each other in Japanese may not be so flexible in Chinese. Thus, any comprehensive merger of recommended code points would have to maintain some variants that differ only slightly in appearance even if the meaning is 100% the same for all contexts in one language, because in another language the two characters may not be 100% drop-in replacements.

==Examples of language-dependent glyphs==
In each row of the following table, the same character is repeated in all six columns. However, each column is marked (by the codice_1 attribute) as being in a different language: Chinese (simplified and two types of traditional), Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese. The browser should select, for each character, a glyph (from a font) suitable to the specified language. (Besides actual character variation—look for differences in stroke order, number, or direction—the typefaces may also reflect different typographical styles, as with serif and non-serif alphabets.) This only works for fallback glyph selection if you have CJK fonts installed on your system and the font selected to display this article does not include glyphs for these characters.

No character variant that is exclusive to Korean or Vietnamese has received its own code point, whereas almost all Shinjitai Japanese variants or Simplified Chinese variants each have distinct code points and unambiguous reference glyphs in the Unicode standard.

In the twentieth century, East Asian countries made their own respective encoding standards. Within each standard, there coexisted variants with distinct code points, hence the distinct code points in Unicode for certain sets of variants. Taking Simplified Chinese as an example, the two character variants of (U+5167) and (U+5185) differ in exactly the same way as do the Korean and non-Korean variants of (U+5168). Each respective variant of the first character has either (U+5165) or (U+4EBA). Each respective variant of the second character has either (U+5165) or (U+4EBA). Both variants of the first character got their own distinct code points. However, the two variants of the second character had to share the same code point.

The justification Unicode gives is that the national standards body in the PRC made distinct code points for the two variations of the first character /, whereas Korea never made separate code points for the different variants of . There is a reason for this that has nothing to do with how the domestic bodies view the characters themselves. China went through a process in the twentieth century that changed (if not simplified) several characters. During this transition, there was a need to be able to encode both variants within the same document. Korean has always used the variant of with the (U+5165) radical on top. Therefore, it had no reason to encode both variants. Korean language documents made in the twentieth century had little reason to represent both versions in the same document.

Almost all of the variants that the PRC developed or standardized got distinct code points owing simply to the fortune of the Simplified Chinese transition carrying through into the computing age. This privilege however, seems to apply inconsistently, whereas most simplifications performed in Japan and mainland China with code points in national standards, including characters simplified differently in each country, did make it into Unicode as distinct code points.

Sixty-two Shinjitai &quot;simplified&quot; characters with distinct code points in Japan got merged with their Kyūjitai traditional equivalents, like . This can cause problems for the language tagging strategy. There is no universal tag for the traditional and &quot;simplified&quot; versions of Japanese as there are for Chinese. Thus, any Japanese writer wanting to display the Kyūjitai form of may have to tag the character as &quot;Traditional Chinese&quot; or trust that the recipient&#x27;s Japanese font uses only the Kyūjitai glyphs, but tags of Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese may be necessary to show the two forms side by side in a Japanese textbook. This would preclude one from using the same font for an entire document, however. There are two distinct code points for in Unicode, but only for &quot;compatibility reasons&quot;. Any Unicode-conformant font must display the Kyūjitai and Shinjitai versions&#x27; equivalent code points in Unicode as the same. Unofficially, a font may display differently with 海 (U+6D77) as the Shinjitai version and 海 (U+FA45) as the Kyūjitai version (which is identical to the traditional version in written Chinese and Korean).

The radical (U+7CF8) is used in characters like /, with two variants, the second form being simply the cursive form. The radical components of (U+7D05) and (U+7EA2) are semantically identical and the glyphs differ only in the latter using a cursive version of the component. However, in mainland China, the standards bodies wanted to standardize the cursive form when used in characters like . Because this change happened relatively recently, there was a transition period. Both (U+7D05) and (U+7EA2) got separate code points in the PRC&#x27;s text encoding standards bodies so Chinese-language documents could use both versions. The two variants received distinct code points in Unicode as well.

The case of the radical (U+8278) proves how arbitrary the state of affairs is. When used to compose characters like (U+8349), the radical was placed at the top, but had two different forms. Traditional Chinese and Korean use a four-stroke version. At the top of should be something that looks like two plus signs (). Simplified Chinese, Kyūjitai Japanese and Shinjitai Japanese use a three-stroke version, like two plus signs sharing their horizontal strokes (, i.e. ). The PRC&#x27;s text encoding bodies did not encode the two variants differently. The fact that almost every other change brought about by the PRC, no matter how minor, did warrant its own code point suggests that this exception may have been unintentional. Unicode copied the existing standards as is, preserving such irregularities.

The Unicode Consortium has recognized errors in other instances. The myriad Unicode blocks for CJK Han Ideographs have redundancies in original standards, redundancies brought about by flawed importation of the original standards, as well as accidental mergers that are later corrected, providing precedent for dis-unifying characters.

For native speakers, variants can be unintelligible or be unacceptable in educated contexts. English speakers may understand a handwritten note saying &quot;4P5 kg&quot; as &quot;495 kg&quot;, but writing the nine backwards (so it looks like a &quot;P&quot;) can be jarring and would be considered incorrect in any school. Likewise, to users of one CJK language reading a document with &quot;foreign&quot; glyphs: variants of can appear as mirror images, can be missing a stroke/have an extraneous stroke, and may be unreadable to Non-Japanese people. (In Japan, both variants are accepted).

==Examples of some non-unified Han ideographs==
In some cases, often where the changes are the most striking, Unicode has encoded variant characters, making it unnecessary to switch between fonts or codice_1 attributes. However, some variants with arguably minimal differences get distinct codepoints, and not every variant with arguably substantial changes gets a unique codepoint. As an example, take a character such as (U+5165), for which the only way to display the variants is to change font (or codice_1 attribute) as described in the previous table. On the other hand, for (U+5167), the variant of (U+5185) gets a unique codepoint. For some characters, like / (U+514C/U+5151), either method can be used to display the different glyphs. In the following table, each row compares variants that have been assigned different code points. For brevity, note that shinjitai variants with different components will usually (and unsurprisingly) take unique codepoints (e.g., ). They will not appear here nor will the simplified Chinese characters that take consistently simplified radical components (e.g., /, /). This list is not exhaustive.

==Ideographic Variation Database (IVD)==

In order to resolve issues brought by Han unification, a Unicode Technical Standard known as the Unicode Ideographic Variation Database have been created to resolve the problem of specifying specific glyph in plain text environment. By registering glyph collections into the Ideographic Variation Database (IVD), it is possible to use Ideographic Variation Selectors to form Ideographic Variation Sequence (IVS) to specify or restrict the appropriate glyph in text processing in a Unicode environment.

==Unicode ranges==

Ideographic characters assigned by Unicode appear in the following blocks:

*CJK Unified Ideographs (4E00–9FFF) (Otherwise known as URO, abbreviation of Unified Repertoire and Ordering)

*CJK Unified Ideographs Extension H (31350–323AF)
*CJK Unified Ideographs Extension I (2EBF0–2EE5F)
*CJK Compatibility Ideographs (F900–FAFF) (the twelve characters at FA0E, FA0F, FA11, FA13, FA14, FA1F, FA21, FA23, FA24, FA27, FA28 and FA29 are actually &quot;unified ideographs&quot; not &quot;compatibility ideographs&quot;)

Unicode includes support of CJKV radicals, strokes, punctuation, marks and symbols in the following blocks:
*CJK Radicals Supplement (2E80–2EFF)
*CJK Strokes (31C0–31EF)
*CJK Symbols and Punctuation (3000–303F)

*CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement (2F800–2FA1F)
*Enclosed CJK Letters and Months (3200–32FF)
*Enclosed Ideographic Supplement (1F200–1F2FF)
*Kangxi Radicals (2F00–2FDF)
These compatibility characters (excluding the twelve unified ideographs in the CJK Compatibility Ideographs block) are included for compatibility with legacy text handling systems and other legacy character sets. They include forms of characters for vertical text layout and rich text characters that Unicode recommends handling through other means.

===International Ideographs Core===

The International Ideographs Core (IICore) is a subset of 9810 ideographs derived from the CJK Unified Ideographs tables, designed to be implemented in devices with limited memory, input/output capability, and/or applications where the use of the complete ISO 10646 ideograph repertoire is not feasible. There are 9810 characters in the current standard.

==Unihan database files==
The Unihan project has always made an effort to make available their build database.

The libUnihan project provides a normalized SQLite Unihan database and corresponding C library. All tables in this database are in fifth normal form. libUnihan is released under the LGPL, while its database, UnihanDb, is released under the MIT License.

<text>The São Paulo Futebol Clube () is a professional football club in the Morumbi district of São Paulo, Brazil. It plays in Campeonato Paulista, São Paulo&#x27;s premier state league and Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the top tier of Brazilian football. Despite being primarily a football club, São Paulo competes in a wide variety of sports. Its home ground is the multipurpose 72,039-seater MorumBIS Stadium, the biggest private-owned field in Brazil. São Paulo is part of the Big Twelve of brazilian football, Brazil&#x27;s biggest worldwide champion and one of the only two clubs that have never been relegated from Brazil&#x27;s top division, the other being Flamengo.

Founded in 1930 as merge between the Club Athletico Paulistano and the Associação Atlética das Palmeiras, the club has used its traditional home kit of a white shirt with two horizontal stripes (one red and one black), white shorts, and white socks since its inception; the color choice was made in honour of its parent-clubs primary colors, and also to represent the colors of the state of São Paulo. Although its main affiliation is with the state and city where it was founded, São Paulo is a national team and the third best-supported club in Brazil, with over 22 million supporters, covering around 9.9% of its population. Their supporters are called &quot;são-paulinos&quot; and are often nicknamed &quot;Torcida que conduz&quot; (Supporters who lead), due to their importance in maintaining São Paulo’s long lasting relevance in South America’s football. São Paulo ranked fifth in Brazil with a market value of R$ 2.214 billion in 2023. 

São Paulo is one of the most successful teams in Brazil with 44 official titles, that includes 23 state titles, 1 inter-state title, 6 Campeonato Brasileiro titles, 1 Copa do Brasil title, 1 Supercopa do Brasil title, 3 Copa Libertadores titles, 1 Copa Sudamericana, 1 Supercopa Libertadores, 1 Copa CONMEBOL, 1 Copa Masters CONMEBOL, 2 Recopa Sudamericanas, 2 Intercontinental Cup and 1 FIFA Club World Cup. It is the only club in the country to have won all available titles, earning the nickname “Champions of All”, an honour achieved after winning the 2024 Supercopa do Brasil. It is also one of two unrelegated Brazilian clubs, the other being Flamengo. 

All five FIFA World Cups won by Brazil contained at least one São Paulo player, an honour shared with cross-city rivals Palmeiras.

==History==
===1930–1934: Origins: &quot;São Paulo da Floresta&quot; (&quot;São Paulo of the Forest&quot;)===

The São Paulo Futebol Clube was founded on 25 January 1930 by 60 former officials, players, members, and friends of the football clubs Club Athletico Paulistano and Associação Atlética das Palmeiras of São Paulo. Club Athletico Paulistano, founded in 1900 and one of the oldest clubs in town and 11-time champions of São Paulo, abandoned football due to the professionalization of the sport. Associação Atlética das Palmeiras, founded in 1902 and three-time champions of São Paulo, intended after the end of the season 1929 to set up a professional team, but failed to do so.

The jerseys of the new club were derived from Associação Atlética das Palmeiras, which were white and sported a black ring across the chest. To the black-and-white of Associação Atlética das Palmeiras was added the red-and-white of Club Athletico Paulistano, and the ring became red, white, and black.

The Club Athletico Paulistano brought to the union star players Arthur Friedenreich and Araken Patusca. Associação Atlética das Palmeiras&#x27; contribution was the stadium Estádio da Floresta, generally known as &quot;Chácara da Floresta&quot;.

Internal arguments and turmoil led to financial problems. The club merged with Clube de Regatas Tietê, another sports club from the town, and the football department was disbanded on 14 May 1935.

===1935–1939: The rebirth of São Paulo FC===
Just after the merger with Tietê, the founders and re-founders created the Grêmio Tricolor, which formed Clube Atlético São Paulo on 4 June 1935, and, finally, São Paulo Futebol Clube on 16 December of the same year.

The new club&#x27;s first game was against Portuguesa Santista on 25 January 1936. The match was almost cancelled, owing to the city&#x27;s anniversary, but Porphyrio da Paz, the football director and composer of the club&#x27;s anthem, obtained permission from the Board of Education Office for the game to continue.

Another merger occurred in 1938, this time with Clube Atlético Estudantes Paulista, from the neighborhood of Moóca, and the club finished as runners-up in the Campeonato Paulista.

===1940–1950: &quot;The Steam Roller&quot;===
In 1940, when the Estádio do Pacaembu was inaugurated, a new era began in São Paulo state football. São Paulo Futebol Clube finished as runners-up once again in the Campeonato Paulista in 1941, and a year later the club paid 200 contos de réis (equivalent to approximately R$162,000 today) to acquire Leônidas from Flamengo. During this period, São Paulo also acquired the Argentinian António Sastre and Brazilians Noronha, José Carlos Bauer, Zezé Procópio, Luizinho, Rui and Teixeirinha. With these new additions, &quot;Tricolor&quot; became known as the &quot;Steam Roller&quot;, winning the Paulista championship five times, in 1943, 1945, 1946, 1948 and 1949. The club sold its Canindé training ground to Portuguesa to raise money for their new stadium, the Estádio do Morumbi, for which construction began in 1952.

===1951–1957: The dry spell===
The run of success of the 1940s, came to an end in the early 1950s, and the club only won two state championships in the new decade, in 1953 and 1957. The 1957 championship was won with the help of the 35-year-old Brazilian international Zizinho, and Hungarian manager Béla Guttmann, both of them becoming idols. Guttmann took charge of the team in 1957 and won the São Paulo State Championship that year. While in Brazil he helped popularise the 4–2–4 formation, which was subsequently used by Brazil as they won the 1958 FIFA World Cup.

In the years that followed, the club struggled to compete with the rise of Pelé and his club, Santos. With the construction of the Morumbi stadium still ongoing, São Paulo entered its longest period without a title in its history, which was to last 13 years.
===1958–1969: Just the stadium===
Since São Paulo&#x27;s budget planning was focused on the Estádio do Morumbi construction rather than the signing of new players, few expensive players were bought during the 1960s, although the club did acquire Brazilian internationals Roberto Dias and Jurandir. In 1960, the Estádio do Morumbi was inaugurated, named after the late Cícero Pompeu de Toledo, the club&#x27;s chairman during most of the stadium construction. One of the few happy moments for the fans during this period was the 1963 Paulista Championship 4–1 victory against Pelé&#x27;s Santos.

===1970–1979: Campeonato Brasileiro (Brazilian Championship)===
In 1970, the Estádio do Morumbi was finally completed and the club purchased Gérson from Botafogo, Uruguayan midfielder Pedro Rocha from Peñarol and striker Toninho Guerreiro from Santos. The club was managed by Zezé Moreira, who was the manager of Brazil at the World Cup in 1954, and won the Paulista Championship after beating Guarani 2–1 in the Campinas a week before the end of the competition.

In 1971, the club beat Palmeiras 1–0 with a goal from Toninho Guerreiro in the final to capture another state title. That year saw the inaugural Campeonato Brasileiro, with the club finishing as runners-up to Atlético Mineiro, managed by Telê Santana.

In the following years, São Paulo and Palmeiras gradually overtook Pelé&#x27;s Santos and Corinthians as the dominant club sides in São Paulo state. In 1972, Palmeiras won the state championship title, only one point ahead of São Paulo, and the following year the clubs finished in the same positions in the Brazilian Championship. In 1974, São Paulo took part in the Copa Libertadores losing in the final to Independiente in a replay.

In 1975, former goalkeeper José Poy took over as manager, and São Paulo won the Paulista Championship after defeating Portuguesa in a penalty shoot-out.

Valdir Peres, Chicão, Serginho Chulapa and Zé Sérgio were the club&#x27;s most influential players when São Paulo finally secured the Brazilian Championship for the first time in 1977 following a penalty shoot-out victory over Atlético Mineiro at the Mineirão. However, they failed to win another trophy until the reclaimed the Paulista Championship in 1980.

===The 1980s: Tricolor decade===
In the 1980s, São Paulo won four Paulista and one Brazilian titles, helped by the impressive central defensive pair of Oscar and Dario Pereyra. 1980 and 1981, the club won the Paulista Championship in successive seasons for the first time since the 1940s.

In 1985, the head coach Cilinho introduced to the world the &quot;Menudos of Morumbi&quot;, a team that included Paulo Silas, Müller and Sidney, and the club once again won the Paulista Championship. The main striker was Careca, a centre-forward who also played for Brazil in the 1986 FIFA World Cup. The midfield featured Falcão, brought in from Italian club Roma and becoming a big part in winning the Campeonato Paulista in 1985&quot;.&quot;
In 1986, manager Pepe led the club to its second Brazilian Championship title, defeating Guarani in a penalty shoot-out. In 1987, Dario Pereyra left the club, but in that year the &quot;Menudos&quot; team won its last title, another Paulista title. The so-called &quot;Tricolor Decade&quot; ended with the 1989 Paulista Championship title and a second-place finish in the Brazilian Championship, when São Paulo lost to Vasco da Gama in the final match.

===1990–1995: The Telê Era: Libertadores and Intercontinental Cups===

In 1990, after a poor start to the campaign in the Paulista, Telê Santana was hired as the club&#x27;s coach, and São Paulo went on to finish runners-up in the Brazilian Championship. In 1991, Santana won his first title after winning the Paulista championship.

In 1991, São Paulo won the Brazilian championship after beating Carlos Alberto Parreira&#x27;s Bragantino, and the club began a period of consistent achievement both nationally and internationally. The following year they reached the Copa Libertadores final, where they faced Newell&#x27;s Old Boys of Argentina. São Paulo lost the first leg 1–0, but reversed the scoreline in the second leg in Brazil, and then won the competition in the penalty shoot-out to take the title for the first time.
In the same year, in Tokyo the club won its first Intercontinental Cup, beating Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Barcelona 2–1. After returning to Brazil, the club beat Palmeiras 2–1 to win its 18th state championship title.

In 1993, São Paulo retained the Copa Libertadores, beating Universidad Católica of Chile in the finals 5–3 on aggregate, including a 5–1 first leg win. After the competition, influential midfielder Raí left the club. The Copa Libertadores win allowed the club to play the Recopa Sudamericana that year, beating 1992 Supercopa Libertadores winners and fellow Brazilian side Cruzeiro. The club also won the 1993 Supercopa Libertadores, beating Flamengo on penalties in the final. The Supercopa Libertadores title meant the club has completed an unprecedented CONMEBOL treble (Copa Libertadores, Recopa Sudamericana, Supercopa Libertadores).

São Paulo was able to defend its Intercontinental Cup title again, beating Fabio Capello&#x27;s Milan 3–2. Müller scored the winning goal in the 86th minute of the match, from an assist by Toninho Cerezo. This meant the club had completed a quadruple.

In 1994, the club reached the Copa Libertadores finals for the third year in a row, and faced Argentina&#x27;s Vélez Sársfield. On this occasion they lost on penalties to the Argentine side at the Morumbi stadium. But by the end of this year, São Paulo won the Copa CONMEBOL, defeating Peñarol of Uruguay in the final.

===1996–2004: Post-Telê years===
At the beginning of 1996, owing to health issues, Telê Santana left São Paulo, ending the club&#x27;s golden era. Between 1995 and 2004, the club had fourteen managers. Among the most notable titles during those ten years were the 2000 Paulista Championship and the club&#x27;s first Rio-São Paulo Tournament title in 2001. Rogério Ceni, Júlio Baptista, Luís Fabiano and Kaká were the club&#x27;s stars. Raí briefly returned to the club between 1998 and 2000, and with him, the club won the Paulista Championship twice, in 1998 and 2000, after beating Corinthians and Santos, respectively. In 2004 São Paulo were back in the Copa Libertadores and reached the semi-finals before being eliminated by underdogs Once Caldas from Colombia. At the end of that year, Émerson Leão was hired as the club&#x27;s coach.

In 2003, São Paulo made a deal with Spanish amateur side Santangelo Club Aficionado that resulted in the Spanish club changing its name to &quot;São Paulo Madrid&quot;.

===2005–2009: Three Brazilian Championships, Libertadores and FIFA Club World Cup===
In 2005, with Leão as the club&#x27;s manager, São Paulo won the Paulista Championship. Leão, however, would soon leave the club with Paulo Autuori, former manager of the Peru national team, hired to replace him. São Paulo won the Libertadores Cup for the third time, beating another Brazilian side, Atlético Paranaense, in the final. Atlético switched the first leg of the final to Estádio Beira-Rio, Porto Alegre, their own ground not having sufficient capacity for a final, and the match ended in a 1–1 draw. In the second leg, at the Morumbi, São Paulo won 4–0 to become the first Brazilian club to win three Copa Libertadores titles.

In December 2005, São Paulo competed in the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan. After beating Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Al-Ittihad 3–2, they faced European champions Liverpool in the final. A 1–0 victory over the English team gave São Paulo its third intercontinental title. The single goal was scored by Mineiro in the first half of the match. Other players in that year&#x27;s squad included centre-back Diego Lugano, full-back Cicinho, forward Amoroso, and the record-breaking goalkeeper Rogério Ceni, who was selected Man of the Match at the FIFA Club World Championship title match, as well as the tournament&#x27;s MVP.
After the success of the 2005 season, Paulo Autuori left the team to coach Kashima Antlers in the J. League. Muricy Ramalho was signed up as the new coach, having led Internacional to the runners-up position in the 2005 Brazilian Championship. In his first tournament as a manager, Ramalho reached second place in the Paulista Championship, losing to Santos by one point. São Paulo reached the final of the 2006 Copa Libertadores, but lost 4–3 on aggregate to Brazilian rivals Internacional. However, they went on to win their fourth Campeonato Brasileiro trophy, becoming the first team to become national champions in the new league system format.
After being eliminated from the Copa Libertadores round of 16 to Grêmio in 2007, São Paulo won the Brazilian title for the second year in a row, fifteen points ahead of second-placed Santos. They won the title for the third season running in 2008 season, overturning an 11-point deficit behind Grêmio in the second half, to win its sixth league title. Manager Muricy Ramalho was the first manager to win three league titles in a row with the same team.

Despite this feat, Muricy was sacked the following year after São Paulo was eliminated in the 2009 Copa Libertadores quarter-finals to Cruzeiro, its fourth consecutive elimination to a Brazilian side. Ricardo Gomes took over as manager. The club was very close to winning the league for the fourth time in a row, however, after struggling in the final 4 games, they ended up finishing in third.

===2010–2020: Copa Sudamericana and a tough period===
In 2010 São Paulo lost once again to Internacional in the 2010 Copa Libertadores, this time in the semifinals, ending Ricardo Gomes&#x27; spell as manager. The club finished ninth in the league, not qualifying for the international competition for the first time since 2003.

In 2011, the club signed Rivaldo and brought back Luís Fabiano for a club-record €7.6 million from Sevilla. Goalkeeper Rogério Ceni, meanwhile, scored his 100th career goal, against Corinthians in the Campeonato Paulista. Despite these events, it was another very disappointing season, finishing sixth in the league and failing to qualify for the Libertadores once again.

In research conducted by Brazilian sports website GloboEsporte.com, São Paulo, during the eight years between 2003 and 2011, were just the second Brazilian club to earn more money than losses in the transfer market – &quot;Tricolor paulista&quot; received R$287 million, behind only Internacional, which earned R$289 million.

In 2012, São Paulo won the Copa Sudamericana (its only title in the 2010 decade) and qualified for next season&#x27;s Libertadores, finishing fourth in the league under Ney Franco. However, after that season, the club hit a second massive dry spell and struggled to regain its dominance in the Brazilian and South American stage.

For the 2013 season, after seven years wearing kits produced by Reebok, São Paulo signed with Brazilian brand Penalty. The contract was valid until 2015 and the club earned R$35 million per year. This contract was the second-most lucrative kit deal in Brazil, just exceeded by Flamengo and Adidas&#x27; deal of R$38 million. In May 2015 São Paulo presented its new kits, made by Under Armour. In 2018 the team became sponsored by Adidas.

In 2014, 2018 and 2020 the club was one of the contenders for the national league title, but did not win it; São Paulo finished runners-up in 2014, fifth in 2018, and fourth in 2020, the last two being marked by massives drops of form in the second half. In contrast to this, they struggled hard in 2013 and 2017, fighting (and eventually saving themselves) against relegation to the second tier.

Continentally, in 2016 the club reached the semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores, losing to Atlético Nacional.

During the 2010s, São Paulo did not win a single Campeonato Paulista title, the first time since the 1960s.

===2021–present: Champions of All===
In 2021, São Paulo finally ended its second biggest dry spell in its history (8 years); under new manager Hernán Crespo, the club defeated Palmeiras at the Campeonato Paulista finals, winning the competition for the first time since 2005. However, after a continuing sequence of poor results, which included quarter-final exits in the Copa Libertadores and in the Copa do Brasil to Palmeiras and Fortaleza, respectively, Crespo was sacked in October, with the club being involved in another relegation battle at the Campeonato Brasileiro, eventually finishing 13th, after Crespo was replaced by club legend Rogério Ceni in his second managerial spell.

In 2022, under Ceni, the club reached once again the Campeonato Paulista finals, reaching their third state finals in four years; a progress, since São Paulo didn&#x27;t reach the state finals between 2007 (when the knock-out second phase was re-established) and 2018. São Paulo ended the competition as runners-up to Palmeiras; despite winning the first leg 3–1 at the Morumbi, they suffered a heavy 4–0 comeback defeat at Allianz Parque. Also in 2022, the club reached the semifinals of the 2022 Copa do Brasil, being eliminated by eventual winners Flamengo, and suffered another final defeat, this time in the Copa Sudamericana, losing to Ecuadorian side Independiente del Valle in Córdoba, Argentina; It was the first time since 2005 the club reached two finals in the same year. In the Campeonato Brasileiro, however, São Paulo finished in 9th place, one position outside Copa Libertadores qualification.

In 2023, just like six years before, Rogério Ceni was sacked and replaced by Dorival Júnior after getting eliminated in the quarter-final of the Campeonato Paulista to underdogs and eventual runners-up Água Santa. Under the guidance of Dorival, São Paulo won its first Copa do Brasil title in a memorable run, defeating along the way Ituano, Sport Recife and, most notably, city rivals Palmeiras and Corinthians and defending champions Flamengo in the finals, winning the first leg 1–0 in the Maracanã and drawing 1–1 at the second leg in the Morumbi. The club finished 11th in the Campeonato Brasileiro and reached the quarter-finals of the Copa Sudamericana, being eliminated by eventual champions L.D.U. Quito.

After a successful year, Dorival Júnior left São Paulo in January 2024 to manage the Brazil national team; it was the third time the club lost their manager to a national team in more than eight years (the others being Juan Carlos Osorio to Mexico in 2015 and in the following year, Edgardo Bauza to Argentina). Juventude manager Thiago Carpini was appointed as Dorival&#x27;s replacement, guiding the club to the 2024 Supercopa Rei defeating Palmeiras on penalties at the Mineirão in Belo Horizonte.

==Colors and badge==
When the Club Athletico Paulistano and the Associação Atlética das Palmeiras merged, their colours (red and white for CA Paulistano and black and white for AA das Palmeiras) were inherited by São Paulo. The colours match those of São Paulo&#x27;s state flag, and also represents the three main races that lived in Brazil during that period: the Native Brazilians (represented by the red), the White Brazilians (represented by the white) and the Afro-Brazilians (represented by the black).

The club&#x27;s home kit is a white shirt, with two horizontal stripes at chest level, the upper one red and the lower one black, and the badge in the centre of the chest; the shorts and socks are white. The away kit consists of a shirt with red, white and black vertical stripes, black shorts and black socks.

The badge, representing a heart with five points, consists of a shield with a black rectangle in the upper section bearing the initials SPFC in white; below the rectangle there&#x27;s a red, white and black triangle. It was designed by the german graphic designer Walter Ostrich and one of the founders, Firmiano de Morais Pinto Filho. The badge also has five stars, two gold and three red ones: the gold ones denote Adhemar Ferreira da Silva&#x27;s World and Olympic records at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki and at the 1955 Pan American Games in Mexico City; the red ones represent each of the two Intercontinental Cups and the FIFA Club World Cup won by the club.

==Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors==
Although São Paulo&#x27;s kit has been supplied by several different manufacturers, the club&#x27;s traditional home and away kit suffered very few changes and variations throughout the years, making it one the most recognizable kits in Brazil. 
==Stadium==

São Paulo&#x27;s iconic 72,039 seater stadium is officially named &quot;Estádio Cícero Pompeu de Toledo&quot; (Cicero Pompeu de Toledo Stadium) and commonly known by the nickname &quot;Estádio do Morumbi&quot; (Morumbi Stadium). It was designed by architect Vilanova Artigas and it’s considered a monument in Brazilian modernism. Due to its significant cultural and architectural importance, São Paulo‘s administration chose to include the stadium in its cultural preservation list, effectively eliminating any chance of modification and modernization in the stadium. 

MorumBIS has been on the list since 2018, but after the signature of a multi-million refurbishment deal with , São Paulo’s prefecture agreed to withdraw the stadium’s name for the list, paving the way for a R$800 million modernization to be complete by 2030.

In late 2023, Mondelez bought the Naming rights to the stadium for a record R$25 million a year, on a 5-year contract, temporarily changing the stadium’s name to &quot;MorumBIS&quot;. Also in 2023, Live Nation Entertainment signed a R$ 60 million 5-year deal with the club for concerts and events in the Stadium, the deal being the most expensive of its kind. 

The first game played at the stadium was on 2 October 1960, when São Paulo win 1–0 in a friendly match against Sporting Club from Portugal. It was inaugurated in with a maximum sitting capacity of 120,000 people, but now its maximum capacity is 72,039 seats.

The club also owns two training grounds, one named &quot;Centro de Treinamento Frederico Antônio Germano Menzen&quot; (Frederico Antônio Germano Menzen Training Center), nicknamed &quot;Centro de Treinamento (CT) da Barra Funda&quot; (Barra Funda&#x27;s Training Center), which is used mostly by the professional team. The other is the &quot;Centro de Formação de Atletas Presidente Laudo Natel&quot; (President Laudo Natel Athletes Formation Center), nicknamed &quot;Centro de Treinamento (CT) de Cotia&quot; (Cotia&#x27;s Training Center), which is used by the youth teams.

<text>Sport Club Internacional (), commonly known as Internacional, Inter de Porto Alegre or simply Inter, is a Brazilian professional football club based in Porto Alegre. They play in the Série A, the first division of the Brazilian league, as well as in Campeonato Gaúcho Série A, the first level of the Rio Grande do Sul state football league. The team&#x27;s home stadium, known as Estádio Beira-Rio (&quot;Riverside&quot;), was one of the twelve 2014 FIFA World Cup venues and has a capacity of 50,128.

The club was founded in 1909 by the Poppe brothers, with the clear goal of being a democratic institution without prejudice. Its colors are red and white and its fans are known as Colorados. It is one of the most successful clubs in Brazil and the Americas, being the third club with the most international titles in Brazil, with seven trophies. Its historical rival is Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense, with whom it contests the Grenal, one of the greatest derbies of the world.

Internacional is part of a large membership-based sports club with more than 140,000 associates. 2006 was the most successful year in Inter&#x27;s history as they won the Copa Libertadores and the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, defeating European champions Barcelona in the latter and Club World Cup reigning champions São Paulo in the former. Inter once again won the continental title in 2010.

Other major honours include the 1975, 1976, and 1979 Brazilian league titles, the latter being the only time a club has won the title undefeated, the 2007 and the 2011 Recopa Sudamericana, the 1992 Copa do Brasil, and the 2008 Copa Sudamericana.

==History==

===Foundation and early years (1910s)===
The Club&#x27;s foundation can be attributed directly to three brothers: Henrique Poppe Leão, José Eduardo Poppe, and Luiz Madeira Poppe. They arrived in Porto Alegre from São Paulo around 1908, a period marked by the rising popularity of football across Brazil. 
The younger siblings, José and Luiz, had the desire to play football, a sport they learned to practice in São Paulo. Henrique, the older and influential brother, then orchestrated the creation of a new club.
The genesis of Sport Club Internacional is linked to the combination of diverse nationalities. In contrast to the other teams in Porto Alegre at the time, which primarily catered to descendants of Germans, Inter emerged as inclusive to various ethnic backgrounds. The speeches heard at the meetings always revolved around a very important principle for the Poppe family and those present there. Internacional was being created for Brazilians and foreigners, a clear reference to the discriminatory policies of the other two major existing clubs in Porto Alegre, Grêmio and Fuss-Ball.

The club&#x27;s colors were inspired by the street carnaval of Porto Alegre. At the time there were two big carnaval organizations in the city, the green Esmeraldinos and the red Venezianos, after a vote the color red was chosen.

The area of Ilhota, once a humble neighborhood rich in cultural influence, served as the team&#x27;s first ground. The football field on Rua Arlindo, now known as Sport Club Internacional Square, hosted the early training sessions of the team. Subsequently, this location became the venue for the Canela Preta League matches and also saw the emergence of one of Brazil&#x27;s greatest football talents, the legendary Tesourinha. Because of frequent flooding in the neighborhood, the Club was compelled to relocate. Thus, in 1910, it moved to Campo da Várzea, now called Parque da Redenção.

The time at Bom Fim neighborhood wouldn&#x27;t last long, though, and by 1912, Inter had leased Chácara dos Eucaliptos. Situated on an alley with an entrance on Rua da Azenha, this became Inter&#x27;s inaugural exclusive playing venue. It was here that the club initiated its first series of victories, clinching the City Championship in 1913 and 1917.

===Consolidation and first stadium (1920s-1930s)===

In the 1920s, the second decade of the Colorado&#x27;s history marked a turning point in the club&#x27;s history. After the growth of the early years, Inter began to face significant challenges. On the field, few titles were won. Off the field, the situation was not favorable. In addition to financial difficulties, the Colorado almost lost its home, and there was a possibility of the Club closing down. Decisions needed to be made that would alter the course of the club&#x27;s trajectory.

Inter bounced back and strengthened itself, winning its first state title in 1927, initiating the construction of its first home stadium Estádio dos Eucaliptos and becoming even more popular, fully opening their doors to athletes from other leagues, including black people from Canela Preta league (literally &quot;Black Shins&quot; league).

Inaugurated in 1931, in the Menino Deus neighborhood, the Eucaliptos Stadium would become the stage for many glories and the rise of Inter as the biggest club in southern Brazil. Growing increasingly as the &quot;Clube do Povo&quot; (People&#x27;s Club), Inter began to identify even more with the humble classes of Gaúcho society, not only in the stands but also on the field. During this era, talented players like Sylvio Pirillo, hailing from Ilhota, and Tupan, who emerged from the Canela Preta league, were prominent. Inter was beginning to assemble the renowned &quot;Rolo Compressor&quot; team and signaled the impending dominance of Gaúcho football.

===The Rolo Compressor era (1940s)===

The 1940s marked the a golden decade for Internacional. It was characterized by the emergence of enduring idols, along with consistent dominance in the Gre-Nal derby. The Eucaliptos stadium consistently hosted large crowds. In that time, Vicente Rao, who founded the team&#x27;s first ultra, and Charuto, a often drunk supporter who Luis Fernando Verissimo defined as &quot;a Colorado in pure state&quot;, became symbolic fans who are still remembered today. The team of the time is often referred to as the &quot;Rolo Compressor&quot;, Portuguese for &quot;Steamroller&quot;, an expression coined by Rao for a team that had unparalleled success in Gaúcho football. The extremely offensive side played from 1939 to 1948 and won eight Rio Grande do Sul championships, and also achieved the first instance of a team winning the state championship six times in a row in Rio Grande do Sul.

The reason for such superiority dated back to 1928, the year Inter started to have black players in their squad – something that was not allowed by rivals Grêmio until 1952. That decision ended up strengthening the team, which placed no restrictions. Before football became professional, however, most black players preferred to play in the Canela Preta league, which provided bonuses for participating athletes. When clubs began to professionalize and pay salaries, albeit low ones, more black athletes start accepting invitations to play for Internacional.

That team included some of the greatest football players in the club&#x27;s history. Alfeu, Tesourinha, Abigail, Carlitos, Adãozinho, among others. The term &quot;Rolo Compressor&quot; was coined to represent Inter&#x27;s power of &quot;crushing the opposition&quot; in their quest for victories. It showed the superiority of the team at that time.

===The Rolinho days (1950s)===

Supporters rallied behind the construction of the concrete bleachers of Eucaliptos Stadium in 1947, a project that extended until 1950. Similar to the earlier efforts during the construction of the stadium and later during the inauguration of Beira-Rio, it was the fans who mobilized resources and sought materials to enhance the Club&#x27;s facilities. After that, the stadium hosted two matches of the FIFA World Cup in 1950 – Mexico vs Yugoslavia and Mexico vs Switzerland.

On the pitch, Inter kept having success. The 1950s were marked by a squad of great players like Paulinho, Florindo, Oréco, Chinesinho, Odorico, Salvador, Jerônimo, Luizinho and Canhotinho, all led by the manager Teté in a team that would be called the &quot;Rolinho&quot; (little steamroller) in allusion to the great team of the 1940s. The great stars of this period, however, were certainly the strikers Bodinho and Larry. Among the achievements of this decade are five state titles and a historic 6-2 victory against Grêmio in the inauguration of the Estádio Olímpico, the new home of the rival team. The quality of the team is also proven by the fact that Inter provided most of the squad for the brazilian national team that won the 1956 Pan-American Games in Mexico.

===Building the Beira-Rio (1960s)===

The club spent three decades at the iconic Eucaliptos Stadium, renowned for its mystique, yet it eventually became inadequate for the club&#x27;s growing needs. In the Sixties, the Eucaliptos was becoming small for the large fan base.

Exactly in the year when the long-standing dominance of Inter in the Gaúcho football was coming to an end, 1956, the story of the construction of the Beira-Rio, began. On September 12, 1956, Councilman Ephraim Pinheiro Cabral, a man involved in football who had presided over Inter on several occasions, presented a project in the Porto Alegre City Council for the donation of an area that would be filled in the Guaíba River. In fact, Inter was gaining a piece of land within the water.

The Beira-Rio was largely built with the contribution of the fans, who brought bricks, cement, and iron for the construction, including from the countryside. In this regard, there were special radio programs to mobilize Internacional supporters throughout Rio Grande do Sul, but the 1960s were a challenging period for Inter in football, the Beira-Rio seemed like it would never be completed. Tired of the team&#x27;s defeats at the nearby Eucaliptos Stadium, fans would go out to see the construction of the new stadium and to cheer for the construction workers.

Despite the scarce financial resources, primarily directed towards the construction of the Beira-Rio, Inter assembled good teams, relying on the talent of youngsters like Bráulio, Dorinho, and Pontes. In their first participation in a national competition, the Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa of 1967, Inter had a remarkable campaign, reaching the final phase and ultimately securing the runner-up position against Ademir da Guia&#x27;s Palmeiras. The following year, the Colorado repeated their performance, narrowly missing out on the title, finishing just behind Pelé&#x27;s Santos. Inter was beginning to establish itself among the top clubs in Brazil.

Finally, the Beira-Rio was inaugurated on Sunday, April 6, 1969, two days and 60 years after the foundation of Inter. The inaugural match was a 2-1 victory against Benfica from Portugal, which had Eusébio as its main star, Claudiomiro scored the first goal at the new stadium 

===Kings of Brazil (1970s)===

In 1970s Internacional achieved eight Campeonato Gaúcho titles in a row, the longest consecutive title streak in the state, winning all regional championships from 1969 to 1976. It was a remarkable accomplishment for Internacional, surpassing their rival Grêmio&#x27;s seven titles streak in 1960s. The 1970s, however, would bring even more achievements.

Perhaps no other time is remembered with more affection and longing by the Internacional supporters than the victorious Seventies. In that decade, Inter became the most successful club in Rio Grande do Sul and in Brazil. The new Beira-Rio Stadium lived up to the expectations of the passionate fans.

Inter achieved great results in the first national championships it competed in at Beira-Rio, finishing in fifth place in the 1969, 1970 and 1971 tournaments, which were decided in quadrangular rounds. Gradually, names like Valdomiro, Claudiomiro, Carpegiani, Hermínio, Pontes, Cláudio Duarte, Tovar, and Carbone were taking on the leading roles of the red team. Leading the red dugout at the turn of the decade was the manager Daltro Menezes.

Changes and progress started in 1972. Now under the command of a new coach, Dino Sani, Inter received the reinforcement of chilean center-back Figueroa, who would soon become an idol of the colorados. The year also brought a third place at the Brasileirão, achieved in a historic campaign that took the club to the semifinals against Palmeiras. A draw in 1-1, however, took the team from São Paulo to the finals.
Consolidated in the country&#x27;s national championship, the club reached the mid-1970s determined not only to occupy a prominent role in the tournament but also to lift the long-awaited trophy. To achieve this, the club went after a coach with experience in national cups. At the opening of 1974, Inter had a new commander: Rubens Minelli. The coach was revolutionary for his time, known for deploying teams that controlled space and performed rehearsed plays, also introducing in Brazil the famous offside trap. That year, the club also signed goalkeeper Manga from Nacional, and left winger Lula from Fluminense. With the signing of Lula for the left wing, which happened almost simultaneously with Minelli&#x27;s arrival, Inter began to show greater balance on the sides of the field. Already beloved by the red crowd, Valdomiro, who participated in 1974 FIFA World Cup, ruled the right flank, but lacked a companion with football skills matching his own on the other side, not anymore. 
In midfield, Falcão was already established as a starter. The main highlight in the central region, however, was Paulo César Carpegiani. One of Brazil&#x27;s key players on the World Cup that year, the number 10 was idolized by the fans. To the duo of Paulos, Escurinho was added, thus completing Minelli&#x27;s trio of midfielders. From the youth categories, the champions of the Copa São Paulo at the beginning of the season, Jair, Caçapava, Chico Fraga and Batista were also integrated into the main squad, adding even more strength to the red team. In the Brasileirão, two draws and one defeat in the final quadrangular resulted in another fourth place. However, this time, the team ended the season with greater authority than seen in the past. United, the group was ready to conquer Brazil.
The opening of the 1975 season was different for Inter. Given its growing fame, the club was invited to undertake a tour of Europe. Rubens Minelli spent five consecutive weeks with his players, a crucial time to earn even greater admiration from the athletes and consequently, to fully implement his football concepts within the group. The results obtained endorsed the innovations promoted in Inter&#x27;s team. In 14 matches, Inter won 13 games and drew one, scoring 50 goals and conceding only one. Excellent, these numbers justly represented the high performance of the team, prompting comparisons, from The Sunday Times, between Inter and AFC Ajax who had recently won three consecutive Champions League titles.

After winning a seventh state title in a row, Inter debuted the 1975 Brazilian Championship on Wednesday, August 20. At Beira-Rio, tens of thousands of Inter fans filled the stands to cheer for the People&#x27;s Club in the opening round of the Brasileirão. Riding high on its state championship victory, Inter continued their good form and the team went on to end the initial phase of the Brasileirão at the top of their group, adding eight victories, two draws, and only one defeat. The second phase saw Inter oscillating, but ultimately qualifying in second place. In the semifinal, the opponent would be Fluminense&#x27;s &quot;Tricolor Machine&quot;. Fluminense wasn&#x27;t dubbed the Machine by chance. A historic generation at the Rio de Janeiro-based Tricolor, featuring names like Félix, Carlos Alberto Torres, Marco Antônio, and Paulo Cezar Caju, who were World Cup champions with Brazil in 1970, reached its peak in 1975 with the signing of Rivellino, another star from the Brazil squad that won the World Cup in Mexico. The gaúchos came out on top by winning 2-0, with goals from Lula, after a beautiful pass from Falcão, and a stunning goal from Paulo César Carpegiani. The result took the Inter to face Cruzeiro in the grand final.

The mobilization fot the final was impressive. Even though the match was scheduled for Sunday, December 14, hotel rooms in Porto Alegre had been fully booked since Friday. Even earlier, on Thursday, tickets for the Inter fans had been sold out. The Beira-Rio, massive as it was, seemed small compared to the passion of the fans, who came from all corners to the Rio Grande do Sul capital. Everyone wanted to be part of the decision - the people from the stands and the athletes field. Inter was aware of the quality of Cruzeiro, a traditional team already crowned as Brazilian champions in 1966, and boasting an abundance of star players in its lineup. Piazza led other stars such as Raul, Nelinho, Zé Carlos, Joãozinho, and Palhinha, all of whom were national team players. For this reason as well, that made the match be played at a reduced pace, characterized by constant analysis from both sides on the first half. The title-winning goal, was scored by Elias Figueroa. Known as the &quot;illuminated goal,&quot; as the Chilean defender headed the ball within a beam of sunlight from the sunset over the Guaíba, at the 11th minute of the second half. That ball finding the back of the net marked the beginning of the club&#x27;s sequence of victories in the 1970s. Inter was the first club from Rio Grande do Sul to win the Brazilian Championship, which was largely dominated by teams from São Paulo, winners of 12 of the 18 national titles contested until then, whether in the current format or the previous Taça Brasil and Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa. In total, there were 29 games, 58 points earned, 18 victories, eight draws, and only three defeats, Inter also scored more goals than any other team and conceded the fewest goals, Flavio was also the top scorer of the competition.
For the 1976 championship, Hermínio, Carpegiani, and Flávio were replaced in the starting lineup by Marinho Peres, Batista, and Dario. These were the main differences between Inter&#x27;s teams in 1975 and 1976. With an even better team than the previous year, Internacional was once again sovereign in the first phase of the 1976 Brazilian Championship, with 7 wins and 1 loss in 8 games, scoring impressive 25 goals and securing the top position. In the second phase, the team didn&#x27;t lose, winning 4 games and drawing 1. In the third phase, six wins and two losses in eight games led the team, in first place, to the competition&#x27;s semifinals. The semifinal was played at Beira Rio. And Atlético Mineiro fought hard in a match that felt like an early final. Vantuir opened the scoring for the Minas Gerais team, which showcased the youthfulness of Toninho Cerezo, Paulo Isidoro, and Reinaldo. The lead was maintained until the 73rd minute. Batista rescued Inter, scoring the 1-1 equalizer. And it was him, Falcão, who sealed Inter&#x27;s advancement with a legendary goal, the result of a header exchange with Escurinho, in the dying moments of what is remembered as one of the greatest matches in the history of the Brazilian Championship.

With the right to play the final again at home, Internacional had no trouble securing their second Brazilian title against Corinthians. The São Paulo team relied more on grit and emotion than on technique and were beaten by a score of 2-0, with goals from Dario and Valdomiro. Internacional became Brazilian champions for the second time, crowning their efficient, brilliant, and technical football, as well as elevating Falcão, Figueroa, Manga, and Carpegiani to the highest level among the greats of Brazilian football. The campaign in 1976 was remarkable: in 23 matches for the Brazilian Championship, the team won 19, drew one and lost just three. At the end of the 1976 season, however, coach Rubens Minelli left Inter, concluding a journey of 153 victories, 44 draws and only 20 defeats across 217 matches and three seasons. The coach would go on to win a third national title in a row in 1977, this time with São Paulo.

The 1975 and 1976 titles gave Inter the chance to participate on the Copa Libertadores for the first couple of times. The national success wasn&#x27;t repeated on the continental level, however. In 1976, the defending national champion and its runner-up represented Brazil in the Copa Libertadores de América. At that time, Inter and Cruzeiro were placed in a group with Paraguay&#x27;s Olimpia and Sportivo Luqueño. They led the competition with some ease. However, in a contest where only one team could advance, the stars of Minas Gerais shone brightly. And one game, in particular, became immortalized. Cruzeiro 5, Internacional 4. Arguably the two best teams in Brazil, the teams from Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais engaged in a decisive and spectacular clash. The following year, in 1977, Inter managed to advance past the group stage, defeating Corinthians and the Ecuadorian teams El Nacional and Deportivo Cuenca. However, once again, they succumbed to Cruzeiro in the next phase, losing at home in another closely contested match, 1-0.
The end of the decade, however, was crowned with yet another title, now under new coach Ênio Andrade. With a record number of participants, the 1979 Brazilian Championship was contested by 94 teams. The 1979 Inter team helped revolutionize Brazilian football. While the two-time champion generation played in a clear 4-3-3 formation, designed to maximize the actions of Valdomiro and Lula, respective wingers on the right and left, the 1979 team easily varied between the two lines of three and a midfield composed of four players and two forwards. The team&#x27;s great wildcard was Mário Sérgio, successor to Lula in the position but responsible for performing a completely different role. After three group stages, the semifinals were reached, in which Internacional eliminated Palmeiras, while Vasco da Gama left Coritiba behind. In the finalw, Internacional won 2-0 the first leg against Vasco in Rio de Janeiro. Excited by the advantage obtained in the first match and euphoric due to the great campaign, Inter fans filled the Beira-Rio for the second leg. Up to that point, in the 22 matches played in the championship, Inter had amassed 15 victories and seven draws, scoring 38 goals and conceding only 12. Therefore, more than just the title, the supporters in red and white desired the laurels of an undefeated conquest. With all players available, Ênio chose his ideal starting eleven. In goal was Benítez. João Carlos, Mauro Galvão, Mauro Pastor, and Cláudio Mineiro formed the defense, while Falcão, Batista, and Jair were the chosen midfielders. Finally, the attack consisted of Valdomiro, Bira, and Mário Sérgio. The team was superior and won 2-1, Bira scored the first and Falcão scored the final goal of the victorious campaign, sealing Internacional&#x27;s third Brazilian championship on December 23, 1979. Internacional was a champion undefeated, a deed yet unmatched by any other club in Brazil.

===Falling short (1980s)===
 The 1980s started off well, with Internacional enhancing its international stature. The brazilian champions of 1979 led by manager Ênio Andrade and legends such as Falcão, Valdomiro and Batista, reached the final of the Copa Libertadores for the first time in 1980 where the team were grouped in Group 3 alongside compatriots Vasco da Gama and Venezuelan sides Deportivo Galicia and Deportivo Táchira. Internacional finished first in their group with four wins, one tie and one loss (although the defeat surprisingly came from Deportivo Galicia). In the semi-finals stage, the &quot;Colorados&quot; were grouped with Argentine side Vélez Sarsfield and Colombian powerhouse América de Cali; once again, Inter managed to top the group with two victories over Velez and two draws against America (which was enough to see them reach the final). In the finals, Internacional faced off against Nacional, who had already won the Copa Libertadores once in 1971. The &quot;Colorado&quot; couldn&#x27;t break the Uruguayan backline and the first leg, played at the Beira-Rio, finished 0–0. At the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Inter were defeated 1–0.

Despite losing what was, at that point, Internacional&#x27;s most important match ever, the team went on to win the Campeonato Gaúcho four years in a row starting in 1981. The success of rivals Grêmio, however, winning the Brazilian Championship of 1981 and the 1983 Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup, alongside Inter&#x27;s defeats at important finals made this decade a bittersweet one for the Colorado team. While the previous decade was full of laurels and glories, the 1980s didn&#x27;t taste quite the same. Despite assembling talented teams and achieving good performances, Inter fell short in the most important competitions. 
The club, however, participated on many international friendly tournaments, winning the 1982 Joan Gamper against Barcelona and Manchester City, the only non-european team to do so. Inter also won the 1984 Trofeo Costa del Sol, the 1983 Europac Cup, the 1984 Kirin Cup the 1987 Glasgow International Tournament, the 1987 Trofeo Cidade de Vigo and the 1989 Trofeo Ciudad de Ceuta
In the late 1980s Inter got close to winning the Brazilian Championship once more, reaching two consecutive finals. In 1987, Inter started off well after finishing the first phase in first place of their group with four wins, two ties, and two defeats. In the semi-finals, the squad overcame Cruzeiro after a 0–1 victory at the Mineirão. However, in the finals Inter lost the chance at a fourth title after being defeated by Flamengo, containing famous players as Zico, Bebeto, Jorginho, Leandro, Edinho, Leonardo, Andrade, Zinho and Renato Gaúcho.

In 1988, Inter once again reached a final, after finishing second in their group in the first phase. On the semi-finals, however, the Colorado faced a battle against arch-rivals Grêmio in what was called &quot;The Grenal of the Century&quot;, so named because for the first time it pitted the bitter rivals against each other in a national competition knockout stage. The 1988 semifinal, decided only in February 1989, determined the finalist for the championship and also granted a spot in the Copa Libertadores. The exaggerated nickname was more than justified at the end of the match: the duel transcended the competition itself and became one of the most emblematic events in Inter&#x27;s history. The red side ended the first half down 1–0 and with just ten players on the pitch after Grêmio dominated the first 45 minutes. In the second half, pushed by a large crowd at Beira-Rio, the Colorados came from behind to defeat Grêmio 2–1 with two goals scored by striker Nílson.

A few days later, Inter would lose the title to the surprising team of Bahia, showing that in the 1980s, even in the most glorious moments, it was impossible to be completely happy. The Grenal of the Century was more than a game, it was a catharsis that transcended causes and consequences. Even though Internacional was considered the favourite to win, the team fell to Bahia after losing 2–1 away on the first leg and failing to capitalize at home with a 0–0 tie.
In the 1989 Copa Libertadores, nine years after the 1980 final, Internacional got close to the Libertadores title once more. After a poor star on the competition; the team managed to progress to the Round of 16 but only after finishing third in their group, winning only two matches, drawing once and losing three. However, that would change in the knockout stages as Inter defeated five-times winners Peñarol 1–2 in Montevideo and 6–2 in Porto Alegre. The quarter-finals saw the team face off against Brazilian champions Bahia in a rematch of the Brasileirão finals of a few months earlier; this time, Internacional beat Bahia 1–0 at home and ground out a 0–0 draw to progress. The semifinals had Internacional face off against a tough opponent: Olimpia, who were the reigning champions of Paraguay. Olimpia, were blossoming in their second golden era with players such as Ever Almeida, Gabriel González, Adriano Samaniego, and star Raúl Vicente Amarilla, all coached by Luis Cubilla. After winning the first semifinal match at Defensores del Chaco 1-0, the team led by Abel Braga played for a draw at home to secure a spot in the final. Excited, 69,928 Inter fans packed the Beira-Rio, some of them already waving banners saying &#x27;Inter, champions of America.&#x27; Little did they know that the dream would turn into a nightmare. Olimpia managed a spirited comeback and won the return leg 2–3 silencing the Beira-Rio. Inter even had a penalty kick in their favor, which was failed to convert into goal. Since the aggregate was tied at 3–3, a penalty shootout ensued to decide the finalist, and Olimpia won 3–5, eliminating the &quot;Colorados&quot;. This elimination has been dubbed as the worst trauma lived by the supporters at the Beira-Rio stadium.
Even though the 1980s were not successful for the club, the decade marked the emergence of some players who became major stars in Brazilian football, such as midfielder Dunga and goalkeeper Taffarel, world champions in 1994 with the Brazilian national team, as well as talents like Luís Carlos Winck, Aloísio and Pinga. Because of that, Internacional found itself as the base for the national team again, in 1984. The last time this has happened was in 1956, when eight footballers out of the 22-player squad called up for the national team for the Pan-American Games played for Internacional. At the 1984 Summer Olympics, Internacional had their whole squad called up, creating a Brazilian side known as &quot;Sele/Inter&quot;. Brazil lost to France in the final and won the silver medal. That same group would help Internacional become Brazilian runners-up in 1987 and 1988.

===Years of resistance (1990s)===
After a decade of misses, the 1990s started promising. In 1992, Internacional finally won its fourth national-level title, the championship-winning campaign in the Copa do Brasil, was thrilling. After thrashing Corinthians at the Pacaembu Stadium with a 4-0 victory in the round of 16, Inter faced Grêmio in the quarter-finals. The duel was balanced, and after two draws, Inter secured the spot over the rival in a penalty shootout. In the semi-final, another overwhelming victory over the teams from São Paulo. The Internacional showed no mercy to Palmeiras and won both legs of the tie - 2-0 at Parque Antártica and 2-1 at the Beira-Rio. The final was thrilling from start to finish. Inter took the lead against Fluminense with a goal by Caíco at the Laranjeiras, but then suffered a turnaround. In Porto Alegre, the team had to overturn the 2-1 scoreline. The title-winning goal came in a dramatic fashion: a penalty kick by Célio Silva in the 88th minute. The club secured the title due to the away goals rule.

The 1990s, however, would represented a time of resistance and passion for the colorados. The team went through ups and downs and the rivals Grêmio were in great form, the supporters didn&#x27;t budge and remained united in the struggle for better days. In the last decade of the century. Inter managed to secure four state championships (1991, 1992, 1994, and 1997), and had an unforgettable Grenal at the Olímpico stadium – a 5-2 with a fantastic performance by Fabiano that soothe the souls of the supporters through those difficult years.

This would culminate in a dramatic season in 1999, in which Inter almost faced relegation. The season started promising, with the signing of midfielder Dunga, former captain of the world champion Brazilian national team and who had started his career at Inter. At the end of that year, however, the midfielder didn&#x27;t have good performances, and the team was still fighting against relegation to Serie B. On November 10, in a packed Beira-Rio and with a header by Dunga, at 36 minutes into the second half, Internacional defeated Palmeiras 1-0 and avoided relegation to the second division of the Brazilian Championship for the first time. The stadium lights were turned off at 46 minutes into the second half, moments after Inter&#x27;s coach, Leão, was sent off. After a few minutes of interruption, the light returned, and the game could be concluded and Inter remained in the first division.

===Renaissance and international success (2000-2015)===
After the long and disappointing 1990s, Inter would still have to face some challenges in the early 2000s decade before the tide started to change. After escaping relegation in 1999, in 2002 Internacional almost faced relegation once again. In the last match of the season, to avoid dropping to the second national division, Internacional didn&#x27;t rely solely on themselves. The team needed Palmeiras to lose to Vitória in Salvador, and for Portuguesa not to win against Bahia in Canindé. Indeed, the parallel results unfolded. The biggest challenge would be defeating Paysandu in Belém, which in that same year had won the Copa dos Campeões against Cruzeiro. Therefore, it wasn&#x27;t impossible to envision a loss at the Mangueirão. The intense heat in Belém prevented a faster pace in the first half, but Internacional returned for the second part and secured a 2-0 victory, with goals from Mahicon Librelato and Fernando Baiano. That year would also mark a tragedy for Librelato, who scored on that match. Just eleven days after helping saving Inter from relegation, 
in the early hours of November 28, a car accident on Beira-Mar Avenue in Florianópolis resulted in the death of the 21-year-old promising young forward. The car he was driving lost control on a curve near the Hercílio Luz Bridge and plunged into the sea. For years the player was remembered on a banner with the words &quot;Librelato lives 7&quot; at Beira-Rio.

It seemed liked another decade of difficult times was coming, but under the leadership of a new president, Inter was finding its way back to the top. Fernando Carvalho has a lot to do with the successful comeback of the club. Recognized even by political adversaries as an executive who understands football, the sports official first ran for the presidency of Internacional in 1999 but was defeated. He won in 2001, faced a difficult year in 2002, but started a transformation process in 2003 that led the club to the top of the world. Carvalho and his team took various measures to reform the club. These included implementing long-term contracts, particularly extending up to five years for young players, as well as adopting performance-based contracts. Additionally, they implemented a strategic plan aimed at boosting the number of club members and made substantial investments in the youth academy. Upon assuming the role, the club had a mere 7,000 associates. However, by the time they left the presidency, membership had soared to 45,000.
Under the leadership of the chairman, Inter entered the new millennium seeking renewal from their youth teams. The club won four state titles in a row, from 2002 to 2005. The club modernized all its departments and prepared for a new football era. The South American Cup meant a return to the world stage and prepared the team for contesting the Copa Libertadores title. The campaign included eight wins, six draws, and just one defeat, to Ecuador&#x27;s LDU Quito in the quarter-finals. To win the title, Internacional had to move past two clubs that had won the tournament three times – Uruguay&#x27;s Nacional and São Paulo, who were the defending champions.

Against São Paulo, Internacional arguably won the title away in the first leg. Stunning the 80,000 &quot;são-paulinos&quot; attending the match at the Morumbi stadium, Rafael Sóbis scored twice in the second half before defender Edcarlos scored for São Paulo. Internacional needed just a draw in the second leg at home, and they left the pitch as South American champions for the first time. Striker Fernandão, who, along with Tinga, scored in the final match at the Beira-Rio stadium, was one of the 14 players finishing as top scorer of the Libertadores, with five goals. He was voted Man of the Match against São Paulo and won a Toyota Corolla as the prize. Fernandão put the car up for auction and gave the money to charity organizations.

Internacional competed in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup and shocked the heavily favored European champions Barcelona with such stars as Ronaldinho and Deco 1–0 in the final for their first ever World Championship. They would also win the 2007 Recopa Sudamericana. Amidst all the victories in 2006, International had a bad start to the 2007 season. But to close this winning cycle with a triumph, Inter won the Recopa Sudamericana as they defeated Mexican club Pachuca with a final score of 5–2. In the first game in Mexico, the team had a good performance but was defeated 2–1. Alexandre Pato opened the scoring. In the second match, supported by over 51,000 fans crammed into Beira-Rio, Inter beat the opponent by a score of 4–0 – the biggest win of the competition&#x27;s history.

After the Recopa triumph, Internacional struggled to refill the ranks left after the triumphant generation of 2006; the club finished in 11th place in the Série A, which was barely enough to allow Internacional to participate in the 2008 Copa Sudamericana. In 2008, Internacional won their state championship and participated in a friendly tournament called Dubai Cup 2008. In the same year, Internacional won the Copa Sudamericana, beating Argentine side Estudiantes de La Plata, becoming the first Brazilian winners of the trophy. Internacional repeated the Copa Sudamericana title; finished in a much-improved 6th place in the national league; retained their state title; reached the finals of the Copa do Brasil (the best finish the club has had since 1999); and won the Suruga Bank tournament. On 2 April 2009, Inter launched its third uniform celebrating its centenary, with a golden shirt, red shorts and red socks. The golden shirt represented the glories won in their history. In August 2009, English club Tottenham Hotspur announced that a partnership was completed between the two clubs. The team performed extremely well on the 2009 Brazilian Championship, finishing as runners-up to Flamengo by 2 points. With this 2nd place, Internacional qualified to participate, once again, in the 2010 Copa Libertadores.

Internacional was the top-seed of Group 5, which also contained Ecuador side Deportivo Quito and Emelec, as well as Cerro from Uruguay. In the 2010 season, Internacional finished first in their group, winning their three home matches and tying their away games, no least thanks to figures such as Kléber, Alecsandro, Giuliano and Argentine midfielder Andrés D&#x27;Alessandro. This saw the &quot;Colorados&quot; face off against Argentine champions Banfield; the series finished in a tight 3–3 scoreline, with Kléber&#x27;s away goal in Banfield enough to send them through to the quarterfinals. In that stage, Internacional faced reigning champions Estudiantes, in a rematch of the 2008 Copa Sudamericana Finals. Despite dominating most of the first leg played in Porto Alegre, Internacional only managed a 1–0 win. In Argentina, Estudiantes were winning 2–0 until the 88th minute, when Giuliano, Internacional&#x27;s star goalscorer, put the ball in the net to give Inter a much needed goal and see them through to the semifinals to meet São Paulo, in a rematch of the finals four years earlier. Again, Internacional only managed a 1–0 win at home despite dominating the game, and in São Paulo Alecsandro scored the decisive, away goal that saw Inter go through to their third final ever of the competition. Internacional won their second Copa Libertadores title after they defeated Guadalajara 1–2 in the first leg and 3–2 in the second leg to clinch a 5–3 aggregate win.

This victory gave Internacional the right to compete once again in the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup, with the goal of repeating the 2006 feat and becoming one of the very few Brazilian soccer clubs to have won the Club World Cup twice. However, they were eliminated in the semi-final by Congolese side TP Mazembe, the African champions, in a 0–2 upset that completely stunned Brazilian soccer specialists and fans, and also most international soccer observers.
Starting with minor works in 2011, the Beira-Rio stadium went through a complete renovation to receive matches of 2014 FIFA World Cup. The project named &#x27;Giant Forever&#x27; went on full force in March 2012 when Inter partnership with Andrade Gutierrez took off, and lasted about two years. During this period, the home of the Colorados was adapted to the international football requirements and standards stipulated by FIFA, while maintaining the same structure and soul. The reopening was marked by a historic celebration show, along with a friendly match against Peñarol, who also participated in the inauguration tournament of the Stadium in 1969. Just like the Eucaliptos stadium in 1950, the home of Inter once again became a venue for a World Cup. International stars like Messi, Toni Kroos, Robben, and Benzema shone on the field during the five matches played there.

===Relegation, financial trouble and restructure (2016-present)===
After a pretty good start in the 2016 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Internacional started to struggle and fell off to the bottom of the table, a run which included a 14-game winless streak, the longest in its history on the competition. The streak ended on September 8 with Inter&#x27;s 2-1 comeback win over Santos. Two coaches had been fired up to that point: Argel Fucks, after losing to Santa Cruz, and the idol Falcão, who lasted just five games. To steer the team clear of relegation, the club&#x27;s football department, now led by Fernando Carvalho, president during the glorious days of the 2000s, brought back Celso Roth, a familiar figure for fans. It was an urgent move backed by another historical president of the club Ibsen Pinheiro.

But it didn’t work. Roth took three matches to secure his first win, then needed another four to claim three points again. By the time Inter faced Figueirense in the first of two consecutive games at Beira-Rio, the team was stuck in the relegation zone. In a tough, scrappy match, backed by their fans, Inter managed a 1-0 victory, providing a much-needed boost to escape their difficult situation.

The team continued to struggle and Lisca was called as new manager, a last-ditch effort to rally the players. However, things took a turn for the worse in the 36th round. After Vitória, a direct rival in the fight against relegation, thrashed Figueirense on Sunday, Inter faced Corinthians at the Itaquerão needing a win. But a questionable penalty and a poor performance led to another defeat, virtually sealing their relegation to the second division.

Finally, on December 11, 2016, an apathetic Inter only managed a draw against Fluminense on a hot Sunday afternoon. Lacking energy, the team was dominated by the Rio side and showed no signs of breaking their winless streak away from home. The final whistle marked the darkest moment in Inter&#x27;s history. With 38 games played, they had only 11 wins, 10 draws, and 17 losses, leading to relegation.

That led to the club&#x27;s first relegation in its history, only ten years after winning the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup over a historical FC Barcelona team. Despite this setback, the club would eventually be promoted after finishing second in 2017 Campeonato Brasileiro Série B.

==Beira-Rio==
Internacional plays its home games on its own stadium Beira-Rio. The stadium was built in the 1960s largely with the contribution of the fans, who brought bricks, cement, and iron for the construction and was inaugurated in April 1969.

The Beira-Rio underwent a major modernization process aimed at the 2014 World Cup. The works of the project, called &#x27;Gigante Para Sempre&#x27; (Giant Forever), lasted about two years. The stadium was completely closed for renovations for the World Cup starting in December 2012. During this period, Inter had to make do with temporary homes, such as Estádio do Vale in Novo Hamburgo and Estádio Centenário in Caxias do Sul.
The stadium reinauguration took place in April 2014. Beira-Rio is now the second biggest stadium in the Rio Grande do Sul state and also South Brazil and can currently accommodate a total of 50,848 people. Additionally, a standing area introduced in early 2019 can now hold up 5,000 supporters.

The stadium hosted the last match in the finals of most of Inter&#x27;s most important titles including the national titles of 1975,1976 and 1979, the 1992 Copa do Brasil, the 2006 and 2010 Copa Libertadores and 2008 Copa Sudamericana.

==Symbols==

===Crests===
The first crest of Sport Club Internacional was designed with the initials SCI in red over a white background, without the red contour that appeared shortly afterward. In the Fifties, the colors were inverted, the initials written in white over a red background. Stars were added to crest after the 1975 and 1976 national titles, a third star accompanied by a silver laurel was placed above the symbol after the 1979 undefeated national title, the laurel would later be removed in the 1980s. A fourth star was added after the 1992 Copa do Brasil title.

After the club won the Copa Libertadores, the emblem gained another star which was 50% bigger was placed above the other four. However, Inter won the FIFA Club World Cup that same year, and the star symbolizing the Copa Libertadores title was moved down between the four stars representing the club&#x27;s national honors, and a new diamond star was placed above it to commemorate the world crown. In 2007, after winning the Recopa Sudamericana, a crown was added to the crest to represent the clubs three international titles in a row, silver laurels were also added representing the Brasileirão titles as placed below the crest. This version of the crest was short lived, though, as in 2009, a circle with the name and year of foundation of the club were added around the traditional crest and the crown, laurels and stars were all removed for the club&#x27;s centenary.

===Flag===

The flag of Sport Club Internacional consists of two right-angled triangles with the official colors red and white, with the red triangle having its base on the flagpole. In the upper corner, next to the flagpole, there is the club&#x27;s crest and the founding year. At the Beira-Rio stadium, fans can behold a 110 square meters flag on a mast of 55 meters in height.

===Saci===
Initially, in the 1950s, the newspapers of the time created the figure of a little black boy wearing the Colorado jersey to represent Internacional and its popular and black fanbase in cartoons. The character later evolved to be a Saci, which was popularized by a drawing by Ziraldo. Like the black boy from the original cartoons, the main characteristic of Saci is mischief; he is very playful, enjoys teasing animals and people. He was adopted by Internacional as the club&#x27;s mascot precisely because of these traits of &quot;playing pranks on its opponents&quot;.

===Anthem===

Nélson Silva was a carioca from Rio de Janeiro, a composer from the slums, who lived in Porto Alegre. The musician first visited Rio Grande do Sul to perform with his musical group, Águias da Noite in the early 1940s. After the show, though, he never left. He became a radio host, with shows on TV Piratini and Farroupilha Radio, in addition to continuing to sing and play in nightclubs, but most importantly, he became an Internacional fan.

In 1956, Silva was listening to a match between Inter and Aimoré on the radio, a friendly held in São Leopoldo. He was distraught upon learning that his favorite team had lost 3-1. He was supposed to meet his girlfriend Ieda after the game to go to the cinema. But the game made him forget about his commitments that afternoon. He sat angrily at the table of a bar across the street, he began to write a hymn of praise to Inter, and that&#x27;s how &quot;Celeiro de Ases&quot; (Barn of Aces) came to be.

The anthem stayed in a drawer at Farroupilha radio station for a long time, according to Turiassu Silva, Nelson&#x27;s son. He showed it to some colleagues, the words spread, and eventually, it became popular among the fans. In 1966, the club launched a contest for the creation of an anthem. There were many candidates, but none of the anthems satisfied the Colorado soul like the one that was made on that angry afternoon by Nélson Silva, his composition soon became the formal song to celebrate the feelings of the Colorado fans.

In an interview for Internacional&#x27;s newspaper in 1975, Nelson said that he never charged the club any amount for the use of the song. His greatest achievement, he said, was being known as the man who composed the Colorado anthem.

<text>Cruzeiro Esporte Clube () is a Brazilian professional football club, based in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Although competing in a number of different sports, Cruzeiro is mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the top tier of the Brazilian football league system, as well as in the Campeonato Mineiro, the state of Minas Gerais&#x27;s premier state league.

The club was founded on 2 January 1921, by sportsmen from the Italian colony of Belo Horizonte as &quot;Società Sportiva Palestra Itália&quot;. As a result of the Second World War, the Brazilian federal government banned the use of any symbols referring to the Axis powers in 1942. On October 7, 1942, club board members rebaptized the club with the name of a leading national symbol: the Cruzeiro do Sul&#x27;s constellation. Cruzeiro play their home games at the Mineirão stadium, which currently holds up to 62,547 spectators. Cruzeiro&#x27;s regular kit colors are blue shirts and white shorts with white socks.

Cruzeiro is one of Brazil&#x27;s most successful clubs. It won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A for the first time in 1966, after defeating Santos&#x27; &quot;Santásticos&quot; in the final series. Cruzeiro has won the Brasileirão again in 2003, 2013 and 2014, obtaining the best-ever campaign in the present format of the competition in 2003 with 100 points. Cruzeiro has also won record six Copa do Brasil titles and the Campeonato Mineiro 38 times. Cruzeiro won the defunct state competitions Taça Minas Gerais five times, the Copa dos Campeões Mineiros twice, the Copa Sul-Minas twice, the Torneio Início 8 times and the Supercampeonato Mineiro once. &quot;A Raposa&quot; also obtained many international laurels such as two Copa Libertadores, two Supercopa Libertadores, one Recopa Sudamericana, one Copa de Oro and one Copa Master de Supercopa. Cruzeiro is one of the two Brazilian clubs to complete the Domestic Treble, a feat accomplished in 2003 after winning the Campeonato Mineiro, the 2003 Copa do Brasil and the 2003 Brasileirão.

Cruzeiro hold a long-standing rivalry against Atlético Mineiro. It has contributed many key and famous players towards Brazil&#x27;s FIFA World Cup squads such as Wilson Piazza, Tostão, Nelinho, Ronaldo, Luisão, Alex, Maicon, Cris, Dida, Jairzinho, Rivaldo and Edílson among many others, as well as towards other countries&#x27; FIFA World Cup squads, including Roberto Perfumo and Juan Pablo Sorín from Argentina, and Giorgian de Arrascaeta from Uruguay.

==History==
Cruzeiro&#x27;s history is traced back to the Italian community living in Belo Horizonte, a city where already some Italian immigrants lived and their desire to set up a football club. Similar to the Italians of São Paulo (who founded Palestra Itália, now known as Palmeiras) the people of Belo Horizonte wanted the Italian colonies in Minas Gerais to have its own club as well.

In the sporting goods and footwear Augustine Ranieri&#x27;s factory, located on the street of Caetés, it was decided the foundation of the club should tackle the three major capital: Atlético Mineiro, America-MG and Yale. Was born at that moment, the &quot;Società Sportiva Palestra Italia&quot;, established on 2 January 1921.

The meeting was attended by 95 founders present the shield and uniform that made reference to the Italian colors, and whose SSPI description would be recorded in the center shell. Another decision was that only members of the Italian colony could wear the shirt. Aurelio Noce was elected the first President.

The Palestra Italia emerged as the representative of the Italian colony. And is characterized as a team of Italian descent, Palestra also stood out by having elements of the Belo Horizonte working class, unlike Atlético and América, who had their consisting squad of college students coming from influential and wealthy families of the city.

The idea of the club being created took a big step when Yale, a sports team from the city, went through an administrative crisis. When some players left Yale over a dispute (Yale, which itself had connections to the Italian community), some went on to found the all Italian, Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Itália of Belo Horizonte. Until 1925 the club would only allow Italian men to participate, despite other teams in the nation accepting people of all skin colors and ethnicities.

Palestra debuted in the Prado Mineiro Stadium with a 2–0 win in a friendly on 3 April 1921, against a combination from Nova Lima. The Nova Lima team united players from two teams from the city: Villa Nova, and Palmeiras, another team form Nova Lima. However, the first official match of Palestra was in a 3–0 win over future archrivals Clube Atlético Mineiro.
In January 1942, Brazil entered World War II and a decree of the federal government forbade the use of terms from enemy nations in entities, institutions, establishments, etc. With this, the Italian name was removed and the club could no longer call themselves Palestra Italia. The name was changed to Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Mineiro.

Around six months later, the president Ennes Cyro Poni called a general assembly for 7 October and suggested the name Ypiranga. Between 3 and 7 October, the local media published the new name thinking it would be approved. In assembly, the counselors and associates kept professional system and approved changing club&#x27;s name and colors. Yale and Ypiranga were suggested, but Cruzeiro Esporte Clube was chosen to honor the biggest symbol of Brazil, the constellation of Crux. The idea was from Oswaldo Pinto Coelho. However, the club kept playing as &quot;Palestra Mineiro&quot; until 1943, when the local Federation approved the new statutes. The approved colors were blue and white, chosen as a compromise to appease the Italian factions within the club management, as it was both representative of the Brazilian flag and the Italian football national team (blue is the color of House of Savoy, who ruled Italy from 1861 to 1946).

With the inauguration of the Mineirão in 1965, Cruzeiro entered one of the most successful periods in its history, in which the club won five Campeonato Mineiro titles in a row, and went on to win its first national title, the 1966 Taça Brasil (the highest honor in Brazilian football at that time) beating Santos of Pelé in the final. Cruzeiro won the first leg 6–2 at the Mineirão, and the second leg 3–2 in São Paulo. In the 1974 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A Cruzeiro were runner-up for the first time, after losing to Vasco in the finals. Later in 1975, Cruzeiro were runner-up in the Campeonato Brasileiro again, this time losing to Internacional. In 1976, Cruzeiro won its first Copa Libertadores de América, over River Plate of Argentina. Cruzeiro went on to be runners-up of the same competition in 1977, being defeated in the finals by Boca Juniors, also of Argentina. After winning the 1976 Copa Libertadores, they participated in the 1976 Intercontinental Cup, now renamed the FIFA Club World Championship, for the first time and tied Bayern Munich 0–0 at the Mineirão, but lost 2–0 to Bayern in the Olympiastadion.

After tasting success in the 1960s and 1970s, Cruzeiro entered a dark period in the 1980s. With the exception of a couple of Campeonato Mineiro wins, the club won no other championships in the 1980s, and had its worst performances in the Campeonato Brasileiro, 33rd in 1984 and 29th in 1985. The 1980s was the only decade Cruzeiro did not participate once in the Copa Libertadores since the tournament&#x27;s creation in 1960. The club were invited to Europe in 1988 by Scottish side Celtic to play a friendly as part of the Glasgow club&#x27;s centenary celebrations.

In the 1990s a new era began, and a 15-year sequence of at least one title per year was initiated. This included six of the club&#x27;s seven international championships and a Campeonato Brasileiro (2003). In December 2010 the CBF (the governing body of Brazilian football) also recognized Cruzeiro as Brazilian champion of 1966, for having beaten Santos of Pelé: 6–2 in Belo Horizonte and 2–3 in São Paulo. The club&#x27;s biggest exploit in the 21st century happened when it won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. With 100 points earned during the season, and just over 100 goals scored in 46 matches, it was one of the most successful campaigns ever by a club in a Brazilian championship. In 2003, besides winning the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Cruzeiro also won the Copa do Brasil and the Campeonato Mineiro, to become the only Brazilian team to win the triple crown.

From 2003 to 2012 Cruzeiro have only won one major tournament (four times): the Campeonato Mineiro (2004, 2006, 2008, 2009). However, the club finished in the top five of the Campeonato Brasileiro in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, guaranteeing a spot in the Copa Libertadores for four consecutive years (2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011). In 2010, after a great campaign in the Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A, Cruzeiro took the second place and qualified for the Copa Libertadores da America for 2011. Cruzeiro&#x27;s biggest success in recent years was reaching the finals of the 2009 Copa Libertadores, but they lost to Estudiantes de La Plata 2–1. After a disastrous 2011 season, escaping relegation only in the last round after a triumphant 6–1 against arch-rival Atlético, Gilvan Tavares became president for the 2012-2013-2014 triennium. 2012 was slightly better than 2011, but still Cruzeiro won no titles. In 2013 Cruzeiro lost Campeonato Mineiro again, despite displaying a good game against smaller clubs. Copa do Brasil started promising but Cruzeiro was knocked out by future champion Flamengo in the quarterfinals. After the elimination Cruzeiro went all in to Campeonato Brasileiro and was crowned champion for the third time, this time four rounds before the championship ended, playing an offensive and intense game that led many, including press and runners-up, to attribute the title many rounds before the mathematical confirmation. Cruzeiro&#x27;s 2014 season was even more successful. It started with Cruzeiro winning the Campeonato Mineiro without losing a single match in the whole competition. In the Copa Libertadores da America, Cruzeiro was knocked out, in the quarter finals, by future champion San Lorenzo de Almagro, being the last remaining Brazilian team in the competition. This loss did not prevent Cruzeiro to lead the Campeonato Brasileiro for almost the whole competition, being crowned champion for the fourth time and becoming the second team not from Rio de Janeiro nor Sao Paulo to win the Campeonato Brasileiro twice in a row. Cruzeiro also got to the final of the Copa do Brasil, but lost both matches to rival Atlético Mineiro.

In April 2024, three years after having acquired it for R$ 400 million, the businessman and former football player Ronaldo sold the team&#x27;s SAF to businessman Pedro Lourenço for R$ 500 million.

==Symbols==

===Colors===
When Cruzeiro was still known as Palestra Italia, the home shirt colour was green. The first home kit was an improvised dark green shirt, with white shorts and green stockings. Cruzeiro used this kit in their first professional game on 3 April 1921, in the Prado Mineiro Stadium, with a 2–0 win over the Villa Nova/Palmeiras combined team, of Nova Lima. In 1928 the shirt became a lighter tone of green, with a white neck design and red cuffs. The shorts continued to be white, but the green stockings now had red and white details, similar to that of the Italian flag. This particular uniform was used up until 1940. The light green color of the shirt would later give the team the nickname &quot;periquito&quot;, Portuguese for parakeet. In 1940 there was a big change to the shirt. The shirt began to feature horizontal stripes, with the club crest in the center. This was the shirt used to win the 1940 Campeonato da Cidade – now known as the Campeonto Mineiro – after the club had been unable to win the tournament for ten years. The club also began to be called &quot;tricolor&quot; instead of &quot;periquito&quot;.

In 1942 Cruzeiro played one game under the name Ypiranga, and for this game a blue shirt with a central horizontal stripe was used. In 1943 Cruzeiro played its first game under its current name. The shirt used then was an all blue shirt with a large white v-neck (scapular) design. The shorts and stockings were white. In 1950, due to bad stadium lighting, Cruzeiro began to use an all-white shirt during night games. The shirt, which featured blue details and blue shorts and white stockings, was used for nine years. In 1956, Cruzeiro used, for a short while, a new shirt that was made up of white and blue horizontal stripes. The uniform was not used in many games. There was a change to the shirt in 1959; the shirt became all blue, a design that would influence later shirts. In the 1959 shirt, instead of using its normal crest Cruzeiro simply used the five stars, in the crest, loose on the shirt. The shirt made its debut in the Estádio dos Tecelões, in a friendly match against Renascença, on 19 September.

In 1984 Cruzeiro had the first ever company logo on its shirt; it was the shirt manufacturer&#x27;s logo, which was Topper. In the same year Cruzeiro had its first shirt sponsor, Medradao. Medradao was only used on the away shirts

===Crest===
The first Palestra Itália crest was a rhombus whose top half was red and bottom half was green (both colors of the Italian flag). In the center of the crest was a white circle with the letters P and I inside it. The following year, 1922, the club&#x27;s crest maintained its rhombus shape, but was now completely white, with the letter P, S and I, inscribed within it in green. In 1923, the crest lost its rhombus shape and instead just had the green letters S, P and I. From 1928 to 1939 the crest was identical to the first crest in 1921. Just one year later the crest became a little different: the top half was green and the bottom half was red, similar to the crests from 1921 and 1929–1939, but instead of green letters in its center, it now had the letters S, P and I in yellow.


The crest introduced in 1940 would be the last for Palestra, because the club would soon become Cruzeiro. Cruzeiro&#x27;s first crest was introduced in 1950 and was very simple: a blue circle, with a white border, inside of which were five white stars, positioned to look like the Southern Cross. This first crest was used for over nine years, until 1959. In 1959 the crest changed, now with a white border around the crest with the words &quot;-CRUZEIRO ESPORTE CLUBE-BELO HORIZONTE&quot; in blue. This version of the crest was used until 1996, making it the longest-used crest by Cruzeiro. In the same year, Cruzeiro removed BELO HORIZONTE from the crest; this format was used until 2005. In 2006 to honor its successful 2003 season, a crown was added on top of the crest, to symbolize the triple crown.

Cruzeiro has not always used its official crest on its shirt. In 1959, instead of using its crest, the club opted to simply put the five stars from the Southern Cross on its shirt. This was done until 2000, when the actual crest was again used. In 2002 and in part of 2003 the loose stars were used. Part way through 2003 a new shirt that contained the actual crest was introduced, but instead of just using the regular crest the shirt featured two Copa Libertadores trophies on top of the crest. In 2004 a similar design was used, but now featured a crown, symbolic of the Triple Crown on top of the two trophies. Since 2007 the club has used the &quot;loose stars&quot; design on home shirts. None of these designs actually became the official club crest.

===Anthem===
The club&#x27;s anthem, &quot;Hino ao Campeão&quot;, was written by Jadir Ambrósio in 1966, in homage to the team of his heart. He never meant for it to become the official anthem, but when fans started hearing it they liked it enough to adapt it as the new anthem.

===Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors===
===Mascot===
Cartoonist Fernando Pieruccetti, more popularly known as &quot;Mangabeira&quot;, created the club&#x27;s mascot, a &quot;raposa&quot; (Portuguese for fox) in the 1940s, as he did for other football clubs from Minas Gerais state league. Mangabeira took inspiration from the club&#x27;s ex-president, Mario Grosso. &quot;He was a director who let no one trick him. He was sly, agile, intelligent and skillful like a fox.&quot; In the 2000s, Cruzeiro has made the &quot;Raposão&quot; (Big Fox) its biggest mascot, appearing at all home games and cheering with the crowd while wearing the club&#x27;s colors. 
In 2010, Raposão won Rede Globo&#x27;s Competição de Mascotes (Mascot Competition), held in their Sunday sports show Esporte Espetacular. The program united 20 mascots from the biggest Brazilian teams and had them competing in series of challenges. Raposão won all of the events and was crowned as Brazil&#x27;s Best Mascot.

In 2010, Cruzeiro introduced a &quot;junior mascot&quot;, named &quot;Raposinho&quot; (Little Fox), a smaller version of &quot;Raposão&quot;.

==Records and statistics==
===Most appearances===

Roberto Perfumo, with 138 matches, was the non-Brazilian with the most appearances for the club, this was recently changed however as Ariel Cabral was awarded this record with 200 appearances for the club.

The player with the most appearances for Cruzeiro is Fábio with a stunning record of 800 appearances, having been with the team since 2005, beating former midfielder Zé Carlos, with 619 appearances, between 1965 and 1977. In third place on that list is 1971&#x27;s Bola de Ouro Winner, &quot;The Prince&quot; Dirceu Lopes, while the fourth place belongs to former Brazilian international and 1970 FIFA World Cup champion Wilson Piazza. The fifth overall player, and second goalkeeper with the most appearances for Cruzeiro is the notorious Raul Plassman, who played a total of 557 games with the team. The non-Brazilian with the most appearances for the club is the Argentine Roberto Perfumo who made 138 appearances for the club between 1971 and 1974.

===Top goalscorers===
Brazilian hall-of-famer and 1970 FIFA World Cup winner Tostão has scored the most goals for Cruzeiro, 249 between 1963 and 1972, having appeared on 378 matches for Cruzeiro (12th overall). He beats Dirceu Lopes by 25 goals on that list, which also has old-timer Niginho (207 goals) closing the top 3, being the only ones with over 200 goals for Cruzeiro. Ninão holds the record for goals scored in a single match: 10 in Cruzeiro&#x27;s 14–0 win over Alves Nogueira during Campeonato da Cidade on 17 June 1928. Nelinho holds the record for most goals scored from penalties: 38; and the record for goals scored from fouls: 42. Walter Montillo&#x27;s 39 goals make him the non-Brazilian with the most goals for Cruzeiro, a record that would belong to Bolivia national football team vice-captain and striker Marcelo Moreno with 48 goals or Spanish 1930&#x27;s striker Fernando Carazo, with 44 goals, had they not become Brazilian nationals.

==Grounds and facilities==

Cruzeiro&#x27;s first stadium was the Estádio do Prado Mineiro, which belonged to the &quot;Federação Mineira de Futebol&quot; (FMF). The club&#x27;s first game at the stadium was 2–0 win over a Villa Nova/Palmeiras combine team from Nova Lima on 3 April 1921. Cruzeiro would use the stadium until 1923 when the club built its own stadium, Estádio do Barro Preto. On 23 July 1923, Cruzeiro debuted at the stadium in a 2–2 tie with Flamengo. In 1945, the stadium went through renovations and would become at that time the largest stadium in the state with a capacity of 15,000 and later on would become known as Estádio Juscelino Kubitscheck (or Estádio JK). Cruzeiro would use the stadium until 1965, when the Mineirão was opened. In 1983, the stadium was torn down and one of the club&#x27;s social clubs (&quot;Sede Campestre&quot;) was built there.

Since 1965, Cruzeiro play their home games at Estádio Governador Magalhães Pinto, often referred to as just Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, MG. Cruzeiro shares the stadium with rivals Atlético Mineiro. The stadium does not belong to Cruzeiro, rather it belongs to the state of Minas Gerais (through a land grant from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais) and is administrated by Minas Arena, a private company, on lease from the state since 2013. The stadium, which was built in 1963, had an original capacity of about 130,000, but over the years that capacity has been reduced, and currently it seats 64,800. Named after former Minas Gerais governor José de Magalhães Pinto, it took over 4,000 workers to build the stadium. The period after the stadium&#x27;s inauguration is often called &quot;Era Mineirão&quot; (&quot;Mineirão Era&quot;), which saw Cruzeiro gain national and international prominence. Cruzeiro also holds the attendance record at the stadium, when 132,834 spectators watched Cruzeiro beat Villa Nova in the 1997 Campeonato Mineiro final.

Cruzeiro have had plans to build a new stadium, especially under president Alvimar de Oliveira Costa&#x27;s tenure. However, the state of Minas asked Cruzeiro to stay at the stadium, and after president Zezé Perrella came to the presidency in 2009, plans for a new stadium virtually disappeared.

The Mineirão was selected as a host stadium for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, with renovations beginning on 25 June 2010, and projected to be completed by December 2012. After the stadiums closing, Cruzeiro began playing home games at the Arena do Jacaré and Ipatingão stadiums, both outside the city of Belo Horizonte. Independência stadium is also being renovated and Cruzeiro will start playing homes games there in 2011 until the Mineirão is ready in 2012.

The club has private ownership of other facilities though, including two training facilities (Toca da Raposa I, which serves the youth division and Toca da Raposa II for the senior squad), an administrative headquarters and two social club facilities. Cruzeiro has often been praised for having one of the leading infrastructure systems in Brazil.

==Administration and finances==

Cruzeiro used to be a nonprofit organization, where the real owner are &quot;sócios&quot; (literally, &quot;partners&quot;) or members (who pay an annual fee), in return, sócios receive benefits from the club, such as access to club&#x27;s properties and tickets, as well as a right to vote for the next club officials. This bylaw lasted from the club&#x27;s foundation in 1921 until late 2021, when Wagner Pires de Sá&#x27;s run as club president led to the club to declare bankruptcy.

Wagner Pires de Sá&#x27;s run as club president was filled with corruption. This led Cruzeiro to stop paying its players, leading to the club&#x27;s first relegation in 2019. Over the next two years, Cruzeiro played the second division while still under the sócios program. This changed in December 2021, when the former footballer Ronaldo, who started his professional career in Cruzeiro, announced he would be the owner of Cruzeiro&#x27;s football department.In April 2024, Ronaldo sold his shareholding to Fan and Billionaire Pedro Lourenço. In an operation whose values revolve around R$ 600 million ( USD 100 million) for 90% of SAF.

<text>Alfréd Hajós (1 February 1878 – 12 November 1955) was a Hungarian swimmer, football (soccer) player, referee, manager, and career architect. He was the first modern Olympic swimming champion and the first Olympic champion of Hungary. Formerly excelling in track including discus and hurdles, he was part of the first National European football/soccer team fielded by Hungary in 1902, later serving as a referee as well as the manager and coach of the national football team. 

==Biography==
Hajós was born in Budapest, as Arnold Guttmann, to a family of Jewish heritage. He was 13 years old when he felt compelled to learn swimming after his father drowned in the Danube River. He took the name Hajós (sailor in Hungarian) for his athletic career because it was a Hungarian name.

In 1896, Hajós was an architecture student at the Royal Joseph Technical University in Hungary when the Athens Games took place. He was allowed to compete, but permission from the university to miss class was difficult to obtain. Upon return, the dean did not congratulate Hajós on his Olympic success, but instead said: &quot;Your medals are of no interest to me, but I am eager to hear your replies in your next examination.&quot;

==Olympic swimmer==
At the 1896 Games, the swimming events were held in the Mediterranean Sea in the cold Bay of Zea at Phaleron, requiring athletes to battle the elements. The 18-year-old Hajós won his two gold medals in extremely cold conditions in April (the water temperature was about with 12-foot (4 m) waves crashing down on him. Impressively, he took gold medals in two of the four swimming events, winning both the 100-metre freestyle with a time of 1:22.2, and the 1,200-metre freestyle in 18:22.1. He was the youngest winner in Athens. His brother, Henrik Hajós, later won a gold medal in 4x250 m Freestyle swimming at the 1906 Olympic Games in Athens.

Prior to the 1896 Athens Olympics, Hajós was the 100 metre freestyle European swimming champion in 1895 and 1896.

==Track and football (soccer)==
A versatile athlete, he won Hungary&#x27;s 100 metre sprint championship in 1898, as well as the National 400 metre hurdles and discus titles. He also played as a forward in Hungary&#x27;s national football (soccer) championship between 1901 and 1903, and on 12 October 1902, he again went down in history as one of the eleven football (soccer) athletes who played in the first international match played by the Hungarian national team, captaining his side in a 0–5 loss to Austria in Vienna. Between 1897 and 1904 he was also a football (soccer) referee, and during 1906 he was the coach of Hungary&#x27;s national football (soccer) team, leading the nation in three games, achieving a record of two draws and 1 win.

==Architecture==
===Silver medal===
In 1924, Hajós, an architect specializing in sport facilities, entered the art competitions at the Paris Olympic Games. His plan for a stadium, devised together with Dezső Lauber (who played tennis in the 1908 Summer Olympics), was awarded the silver medal; the jury did not award a gold medal in the competition. Thus making him one of only two Olympians ever to have won medals in both sport (swimming) and art (architecture) Olympic competitions.

===Career===
Graduating from the Technical University of Budapest in 1899, he originally had a partner, but became independent after the first World War. From 1948, he was technical advisor to the Design Office for Building Construction and was involved in the reconstruction of large public buildings in Budapest and Hungary. The best known sports facility designed by Hajós is the Alfréd Hajós National Swimming Stadium built on Margitsziget (Margaret Island) in the Danube in Budapest, which was built in 1930, and used for the 1958, 2006 and 2010 European Aquatics Championships, and the 2006 FINA Men&#x27;s Water Polo World Cup.

==Honors==
In 1953, the International Olympic Committee awarded him the Olympic diploma of merit. He is a member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame, and in 1981 was also made a member of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. In 2010, Hajós posthumously was awarded the Ybl Miklós Prize, the greatest honor bestowed upon architects in Hungary.

==Buildings==
His first designs were in Art Nouveau and eclectic style, later he turned to modernism and was influenced by Italian styles.

<text>The Clube Atlético Mineiro (), commonly known as Atlético Mineiro and colloquially as the Galo (, &quot;Rooster&quot;), is a professional association football club in Belo Horizonte, the capital city of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. They compete in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the first level of Brazilian football, as well as in the Campeonato Mineiro, the top tier state league of Minas Gerais.

The Clube Atlético Mineiro, the oldest active football club in Minas Gerais, was founded on 25 March 1908 by twenty-two students from Belo Horizonte. Despite having upper-class founders, the club immediately opened its doors to players of every social class, establishing itself as a &quot;people&#x27;s club&quot; and becoming the first most supported club on the state and the eighth most supported club in Brazil. The club&#x27;s mascot, the rooster, has been strongly associated with Atlético since its introduction in the 1930s. Over the years, the word &quot;Galo&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;rooster&quot;) became a common nickname for the club itself. The team&#x27;s regular home kit comprises black-and-white striped shirts, black shorts and white socks.

Atlético has won the Campeonato Mineiro a record 49 times. At the national level, the club has won the Campeonato Brasileiro three times, in 1937, 1971 and 2021 and finished second on five occasions. It has also won Copa do Brasil twice and the Supercopa do Brasil and the Copa dos Campeões Brasileiros once each. In international club football, Atlético has won the Copa Libertadores and the Recopa Sudamericana once each, and a record two Copa CONMEBOL; the team has also reached three other continental finals. The club has also competed in other sports throughout its history, with the futsal department becoming especially notable.

The club plays its home games at the Arena MRV, which has an operational capacity of over 46,000 spectators. Arena MRV&#x27;s construction began on 20 April 2020, its inauguration was on 15 April 2023, and its first official match took place on 27 August 2023.
Atlético holds a strong local rivalry with Cruzeiro, called the Clássico Mineiro. The club also holds a local rivalry with América Mineiro and an interstate one with Flamengo. Atlético has the sixth most valuable brand in Brazil, worth million (€143 million) as of 2016, the 8th largest football crowd in Brazil and ranks seventh in the country in terms of turnover, generating R$244.6 million (€62.2 million) in 2015.

On 1 November 2023, it was announced that Galo Holding completed the purchase of controlling interest (75%) of the club&#x27;s SAF. Of a total of 913 million reais paid by new investors, a third of the amount was used to pay debts.

==History==
===Early years and achievements (1908–1949)===
Clube Atlético Mineiro was formed on 25 March 1908, by a group of twenty-two students from Belo Horizonte, who decided the club&#x27;s name would be &quot;Athletico Mineiro Foot Ball Club.&quot; The club&#x27;s first match was played against Sport Club Futebol on 21 March 1909; Atlético won 3–0, with the first goal scored by Aníbal Machado. In 1913, the club&#x27;s name was officially changed to &quot;Clube Atlético Mineiro&quot;, and in the following year Atlético won the Taça Bueno Brandão, the first competition ever held in the state of Minas Gerais. In 1915, the club won the inaugural edition of the Campeonato Mineiro, the state league of Minas Gerais. The competition was then organised by the &quot;Liga Mineira de Sports Athléticos&quot;, which would later become the Federação Mineira de Futebol (FMF).

Atlético won the league again in 1926, led by striker Mário de Castro. In 1927, forwards Said and Jairo joined Castro to form an attacking partnership nicknamed the &quot;Trio Maldito&quot; (&quot;Unholy Trio&quot;), which guided Atlético to another state league triumph. In 1929, the club played its first international encounter, against Portuguese club Vitória de Setúbal, winning 3–1 in a match played at the Presidente Antônio Carlos Stadium. The ground had opened earlier that year and would become the club&#x27;s home for the following two decades.

Atlético won the state league in 1931 and 1932, before becoming a professional club in 1933. After another Campeonato Mineiro triumph in 1936, Atlético won the 1937 Campeonato Brasileiro, the inaugural edition of the national league. The competition was organised by the &quot;Federação Brasileira de Foot-Ball&quot;, a federation for professional clubs that would later merge into the Brazilian Sports Confederation (CBD). The Copa dos Campeões Estaduais was contested by the 1936 state league champions from Minas Gerais (Atlético), Rio de Janeiro (Fluminense), São Paulo (Portuguesa) and Espírito Santo (Rio Branco). Atlético defeated the latter 5–1 in the final match, played at the Antônio Carlos stadium. Guará rose as the club&#x27;s top player during that period, and the interstate title was followed by two more Campeonato Mineiro victories, in 1938 and 1939.

Success continued in the 1940s, with a squad that included Carlyle, Lucas Miranda, Nívio and goalkeeper Kafunga. The club was dominant in the state as it won the league in 1941, 1942, 1946, 1947 and 1949. Although América had been Atlético&#x27;s long-standing adversary, a new rivalry started to develop with Cruzeiro in the 1940s, as it became Galo&#x27;s main challenger during this period.

===European tour and the Mineirão era (1950–1969)===
In 1950, the club&#x27;s home moved from the Antônio Carlos to the newer and larger Estádio Independência. The season saw another Campeonato Mineiro triumph and the club&#x27;s first European tour, in which it played ten games in five countries. The excursion happened at a time when there were neither regular national competitions in Brazil nor continental ones in South America, and followed soon after the traumatic Maracanazo. The tour and Atlético&#x27;s results, many of which achieved under adverse weather conditions and snow, were seen by national sports media as a historic achievement for Brazilian football itself. The team, captained by Zé do Monte, was dubbed the &quot;Campeões do Gelo&quot; (&quot;Ice Champions&quot;), a title that is remembered in the club&#x27;s official anthem. The club&#x27;s success in the state competition continued in the 1950s, a decade that saw the rise of forward Ubaldo and five consecutive Campeonato Mineiro victories from 1952 to 1956. After another state league title in 1958, Atlético took part in the inaugural edition of the Taça Brasil in the following year, reaching the third round. The tournament, the country&#x27;s first annual nationwide competition, was a cup contested between state league champions, originally created by the CBD to select Brazil&#x27;s entrants in the newly formed Copa Libertadores.

In the 1960s, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro twice, in 1962 and 1963, but failed to advance to the later stages of the Taça Brasil. Mineirão, Belo Horizonte&#x27;s new stadium, opened in 1965 and immediately became the club&#x27;s home. It was in the mid-1960s when the rivalry with Cruzeiro became the main one in the state. In 1967, another national-level competition was created by the CBD, the Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa. It included more clubs than the Taça Brasil, but Atlético did not finish in the top-four in any of its editions in the decade. In the second half of the 1960s, highlights came in the form of friendlies against national sides. In 1968, Atlético, representing the Brazilian national team, defeated European Championship runners-up Yugoslavia 3–2 at the Mineirão; the following year, the &quot;Seleção&quot; itself, which would become champions of the 1970 FIFA World Cup, was defeated 2–1.

===National success and state dominance (1970–1989)===
With the arrival of Telê Santana as the club&#x27;s head coach in 1970, Galo broke Cruzeiro&#x27;s sequence and won its first state league title in the Mineirão, also finishing third in the last Roberto Gomes Pedrosa. In 1971, captained by midfielder Oldair and with World Cup-winning forward Dario as the league&#x27;s top goalscorer, Atlético won the Campeonato Brasileiro. It was the first edition of the competition, also known as the Brasileirão, which replaced both the Taça Brasil and the Roberto Gomes Pedrosa as the new national championship. Atlético played a final group stage against São Paulo and Botafogo, defeating the former 1–0 at the Mineirão and the latter 1–0 at the Maracanã. The victory also secured the club&#x27;s first participation in an official continental competition, the 1972 Copa Libertadores, in which it did not advance past the first group stage.
After four trophyless years, Atlético won the state league again in 1976 and finished third in the Campeonato Brasileiro. That season saw the emergence of a golden generation of players, formed in the club&#x27;s youth academies under coach Barbatana. Reinaldo, Toninho Cerezo, Éder, Luizinho, Paulo Isidoro and João Leite, players who represented Brazil at international level, were central to the team that took Atlético to six consecutive state league victories between 1978 and 1983, and to good results in the Série A. Atlético came second in the 1977 Brasileirão, losing the final to São Paulo in a penalty shootout at the Mineirão, despite remaining undefeated for the entire season. Reinaldo, the league&#x27;s top scorer in that season with an average of 1.56 goals per match, was banned from the final. By his account, this was because of his insistence on celebrating his goals by raising his fist, a political symbol that opposed the Brazilian military government of the time. In 1978, Atlético reached the Copa Libertadores semi-finals and won the Copa dos Campeões Brasileiros, a tournament organised by the CBD between past winners of the Brasileirão. In a repetition of the previous year&#x27;s Brasileiro decisive match, the opponent in the final of this competition was São Paulo, with Atlético this time winning a penalty shootout.

In 1980, after having the best record in the first stages of the Brasileirão, Atlético lost to Flamengo in a controversial final of the competition. Three Galo players were bizarrely sent off, among them Reinaldo, who received a straight red card after scoring twice. The team was then eliminated from the following year&#x27;s Copa Libertadores undefeated, in another decisive match marked by controversy: a play-off against Flamengo that ended after 37 minutes, following the sendings-off of five Atlético players. During the 1980s, the club participated in and won international friendly competitions, such as the Amsterdam Tournament and the Tournoi de Paris. Atlético had the best statistic league records of the 1980, 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1987 Brasileirão seasons, but did not win the title, falling in the finals or semi-finals of those editions. In the second half of the decade, the club continued its success in the state, winning the Campeonato Mineiro in 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1989. Atlético was one of Brazil&#x27;s top sides of the 1980s, providing many players to the Brazilian national team, being dominant at state level and having good performances in the Brasileiro, but a tendency to lose in its final knockout stages prevented a new title in this competition.

===Continental efforts and financial turmoil (1990–2009)===
In the following decade, Atlético won the state league in 1991 and first saw success at continental level in 1992, when it won the inaugural Copa CONMEBOL. The team, managed by Procópio Cardoso, defeated Paraguay&#x27;s Olimpia in the finals to claim its first official international title. As champion of that competition, the club took part in the 1993 Copa de Oro, in which it eliminated local rival Cruzeiro in the semi-finals but eventually lost to Argentina&#x27;s Boca Juniors. After finishing fourth in the 1994 Brasileirão, the following year saw the club win the state league and reach the finals of the Copa CONMEBOL for a second time. This one ended in defeat to Argentine team Rosario Central on penalties, after Atlético won the first leg by 4–0 and lost the second one by the same score. In 1996, Atlético participated in the Copa Masters CONMEBOL, a competition between past winners of the Copa CONMEBOL that was played in Cuiabá; Atlético eliminated Rosario Central in the semi-finals but lost to São Paulo in the final match. The team also finished third in that year&#x27;s Brasileiro and fourth in the following edition, falling in the semi-finals of both seasons. Another triumph came in the 1997 Copa CONMEBOL, when an Atlético team that included Marques and Cláudio Taffarel defeated Argentina&#x27;s Lanús in the finals, and won the trophy for a second time. In 1999, after another Campeonato Mineiro title, a Galo side led by Marques and Guilherme, the top scorer in the league, reached the Série A finals for the fourth time, but lost to Corinthians. Despite international success and good performances in the Série A, the decade was marked by bad club administration by Atlético&#x27;s presidents and deteriorating finances, which made the club one of the most indebted in Brazilian football.

In 2000, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro, reached the Copa Libertadores quarter-finals and the semi-finals of Copa Mercosur, but had a bad season in the national league, the Copa João Havelange. The following year, despite a good performance in the Brasileirão with a squad that included Marques, Guilherme and Gilberto Silva, the team was eliminated in the competition&#x27;s semi-finals, eventually finishing in fourth place. Atlético then finished in the upper part of the national league table in the following two seasons, but in 2004 it barely escaped relegation. In 2005 the club was demoted to the Série B, the second level of the Brasileirão.

On the following year with Levir Culpi as head coach, the club won promotion at the first attempt as Série B champion in 2006, returning to the Série A for the 2007 season. That year, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro, its first trophy in seven years, and finished eighth in the national league. Alexandre Kalil was chosen as the club&#x27;s new president in 2008, and tried to improve its finances and status. In 2009, with Diego Tardelli in good form, Galo led the Brasileirão for eight of the thirty-eight rounds, before eventually finishing in seventh place. Despite some highlights at the beginning and end of the decade, the 2000s were not a successful period in the club&#x27;s history, again marked by bad administration and frequent managerial changes. 

===Resurgence and international success (2010-2017)===
The team won its 40th Campeonato Mineiro in 2010, but finished 13th in the Série A. After an unsuccessful year in 2011, coming close to relegation, the arrival of Cuca as head coach at the end of that season marked the beginning of another successful era for the club. The club moved back to the Independência in 2012, as the Mineirão was closed for renovation, and won the Campeonato Mineiro undefeated. The arrival of Ronaldinho in the middle of the season was an important event for the club, which eventually finished as runner-up in the Série A and earned a spot in the following year&#x27;s Copa Libertadores.

Diego Tardelli and Gilberto Silva returned to the club in 2013 and joined Ronaldinho, Jô and Bernard towards another Campeonato Mineiro triumph. The quarter-finals of that season&#x27;s Copa Libertadores saw an iconic moment for Atlético, when a penalty kick was awarded to Mexican Club Tijuana in injury time. It would have meant elimination if it had been scored, but was saved by Atlético&#x27;s goalkeeper Victor with his left foot. The save, according to sports commentators and fans, represented the &quot;kicking out&quot; of the club&#x27;s historic &quot;jinx&quot;. Atlético then defeated Argentina&#x27;s Newell&#x27;s Old Boys in the semi-finals and Olimpia in the finals, both on penalties, after losing both first legs by 2–0 and winning the second ones by the same score, to achieve its first Copa Libertadores title. The club&#x27;s participation in the FIFA Club World Cup was unsuccessful, as Atlético failed to reach the final, losing to Moroccan hosts Raja Casablanca; Galo eventually finished in third place after defeating China&#x27;s Guangzhou Evergrande.

Under Levir Culpi, who returned to the club in 2014, Atlético won its first Recopa Sudamericana, defeating Lanús for the second time in a continental final. In that season&#x27;s Copa do Brasil, after trailing 0–3 on aggregate in both the quarter-finals and semi-finals (against Corinthians and Flamengo, respectively), Atlético made 4–3 comebacks and advanced. The competition&#x27;s finals were the first at a national level to feature them and Atlético defeated Cruzeiro on both encounters to win its first Copa do Brasil. The club&#x27;s successful run in the decade continued in 2015, when it won the Campeonato Mineiro and finished second in the Campeonato Brasileiro. In 2016, however, Atlético Mineiro ended the season without official trophies, finishing as runner-up of the Campeonato Mineiro and the Copa do Brasil, and in fourth place in the Brasileiro. The club achieved its 44th Campeonato Mineiro title in 2017.

===New golden age (2021–)===
On 2 December 2021, after finishing 3rd place in the last edition of the Campeonato Brasileiro, Atlético won its third Série A title after 49 years, beating Bahia in a thrilling 2–3 comeback to take the title. Less than two weeks later, on 15 December, they beat Athletico Paranaense in the 2021 Copa do Brasil Finals after a 4–0 win at home, the largest thrash ever in a Copa do Brasil finals match, followed by a 1–2 away win to secure Galo&#x27;s second Copa do Brasil trophy. On 20 February 2022, after a 2–2 draw with Flamengo, Atlético Mineiro took the 2022 Supercopa do Brasil title after a long penalty shootout, in which Galo won 8–7. On 7 April 2024, Atlético won the 2024 Campeonato Mineiro for the fifth consecutive year (2020–2024), a feat that was last achieved 42 years prior (1978–82), being the third time in the club&#x27;s history.

==Symbols and colours==
===Crest===
The club&#x27;s first emblem, introduced in the 1910s, consisted of a simple design of the three initials of the club&#x27;s name (&quot;CAM&quot; for Clube Atlético Mineiro) in an oval shape in black. The first and most significant change occurred in 1922, when an edged shield format was adopted, with the letters in its upper part and black and white stripes in the lower. The crest&#x27;s general appearance has been kept ever since, with only the exact format and the placement of the black and white stripes within the escutcheon changing over the decades. In the 1970s a golden star above the badge was introduced, alluding to the 1971 Série A title, which still remains. Red stars were featured on two occasions, referring to the 1978 Copa dos Campeões and the 1992 and 1997 Copa CONMEBOL victories, but these were removed in 1999.
===Mascot===
Atlético&#x27;s mascot, a rooster, is the best known in the country. According to Kafunga, who played as goalkeeper for the club from 1935 to 1955, the &quot;rooster&quot; nickname was associated with Atlético because of its kit colours. In 1945, Fernando Pierucetti, known as Mangabeira, a cartoonist for the &quot;A Folha de Minas&quot; newspaper, was selected to design mascots for each of the three biggest clubs in Belo Horizonte. According to Mangabeira, Atlético&#x27;s would be the rooster because the team used to play with passion and would never give up until the end of each match, like gamecocks in cockfights.

Over the years, the word &quot;galo&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;rooster&quot;) became a cheering chant for the supporters and a nickname by which they referred to the club, an appellation that eventually spread to other football fans in the country. The nickname was incorporated into the club&#x27;s official anthem, composed by Vicente Motta in 1968, whose chorus hails Atlético as a &quot;strong and avenging rooster&quot;. In 1976, a costumed rooster mascot was introduced, to accompany players and children in the match entrance. The stadium mascot was reintroduced with a new costume in 2005, named &quot;Galo Doido&quot; (&quot;Crazy Rooster&quot;) by the supporters.

===Kits===
The club&#x27;s home kit has always consisted of a black-and-white vertically striped shirt, with black shorts and white or black socks. The width of the black and white stripes has varied from season to season, as has the colour of the shirt numbers, which have usually been red, black, white or yellow. Atlético&#x27;s traditional away kit is all-white shirts, shorts and socks, but has had slight variations. An all-black third kit was introduced in the 2000 season, being used again in 2015. In 2008, a black-and-gold vertically striped third kit was launched to commemorate the club&#x27;s centenary, featuring the first crest. Squad number 12 is retired from the club&#x27;s kits, dedicated to the fans.

Since the 1981 season, the club has had its kits manufactured by sportswear corporations, the first one being Brazilian company Rainha. Since 2017, Atlético&#x27;s kits are manufactured by Topper, a company which previously provided apparel for the club from 2010 to 2012. Other previous suppliers were Adidas (1983–85), Penalty (1986–90, 1992–93 and 1997–2001), Dell&#x27;erba (1991), Umbro (1994–96 and 2002–04), Diadora (2005–07), Lotto (2008–09), Lupo (2013), Puma (2014–2015) and Dryworld (2016).

In 1982, bank Credireal was Atlético&#x27;s first shirt sponsor. After one sponsorless season in 1983, Precon, a construction company, appeared on the shirts in 1984 and 1985; it was replaced by Agrimisa bank in 1986. In 1987, Coca-Cola sponsored all participating clubs of Copa União, and the brand remained on Atlético&#x27;s kits until 1994. The club was subsequently sponsored by TAM Airlines (1995–96), Tenda (1997–98), and had temporary deals with Fiat and Telemar in 1999. Two sponsorless years followed, before permanent deals were signed with Fiat (2002–03), MRV Engenharia (2004–07) and Fiat again in 2008. After one more season without a brand on the club&#x27;s shirts, BMG, a bank that was owned by the former club president Ricardo Annes Guimarães, was the main sponsor from 2010 to 2014. MRV returned as the club&#x27;s main shirt sponsor in 2015, being replaced by state-owned bank Caixa Econômica Federal in 2016.

==Grounds==


Atlético had its first home ground built in 1912 at Paraopeba Avenue, in downtown Belo Horizonte, across the street from América&#x27;s first stadium. The club&#x27;s main ground for most of its early years, however, was the Presidente Antônio Carlos stadium, which held 5,000 people; it was nicknamed &quot;Estádio de Lourdes&quot; for the quarter in which it was located. The Antônio Carlos was one of the first stadiums in Brazil to feature floodlights, and opened on 30 May 1929 with a friendly against Corinthians, won by Atlético 4–2. The following year, the stadium was visited by FIFA president Jules Rimet, who watched a night game for the first time. The stadium fell out of favor when the larger Independência was built in 1950, and remained largely unused by the first team; eventually it was sold by the club to the Belo Horizonte municipality in the 1960s. After decades of legal disputes with the municipal government, the property returned to the club in 1991. It was leased to a shopping mall in 1995, which was built in the following year where the stadium once was, across the street from Atlético&#x27;s administrative headquarters.

Construction for the Independência (officially Estádio Raimundo Sampaio) started in 1947 in preparation for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, during which its first match was played. Originally the property of the State Government of Minas Gerais, ownership was transferred to Sete de Setembro FC in 1965, when the Mineirão was built, and the property passed to América in 1997, when it absorbed Sete de Setembro. Before the Mineirão, the stadium was the largest in Belo Horizonte – holding up to 30,000 people – and was preferred by Atlético over the older and smaller Antônio Carlos stadium. After the Mineirão&#x27;s construction, however, Atlético did not use the &quot;Estádio do Horto&quot; (as it is also known) for decades, except for a brief spell in the late 1990s. The stadium was renovated in 2012, while the Mineirão was closed, having its capacity reduced to 23,018. In that year, Atlético announced a deal with BWA Arenas, the stadium manager. The club signed a contract to use the Independência as its home ground for 10 years, but moved back to the Mineirão in 2020.

Mineirão (officially Estádio Governador Magalhães Pinto) opened in 1965 and quickly became Galo&#x27;s new home, as its peak capacity of over 100,000 spectators surpassed any other stadium in Belo Horizonte or in Minas Gerais. Property of the State of Minas Gerais, Mineirão was Atlético&#x27;s home from its opening until its closure in 2010 for renovations prior to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The club temporarily moved to Arena do Jacaré in Sete Lagoas and subsequently to Independência in 2012. Historically the club&#x27;s home ground, Atlético&#x27;s most important matches have all been played at the Mineirão. After the renovation, the Mineirão has an overall capacity of 61,846.

Cidade do Galo (&quot;Rooster City&quot;), the club&#x27;s main training facility since 2001, has been lauded as the best in Brazil and is considered one of the best in the world; it hosted the Argentina national football team at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Other facilities owned by the club include Vila Olímpica (&quot;Olympic Village&quot;), the old training grounds opened in 1973 that hosted the &quot;Seleção&quot; in its preparation for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and &quot;Labareda&quot;, a leisure and health club in Belo Horizonte. In 2015, Daniel Nepomuceno, the club president, announced that Atlético had a four-year project to build a new stadium in Belo Horizonte, with a 45,000 capacity. In 2017, the club&#x27;s Deliberative Council approved the project to build the new stadium, in northeastern Belo Horizonte, named Arena MRV. The construction is projected to cost R$410 million, and expected to be inaugurated on the third quarter of 2022.

==Supporters==
Atlético Mineiro was founded by upper-class students, but from an early age it opened its doors to players from every social class, nationality or ethnicity, which earned it a &quot;people&#x27;s club&quot; status in Belo Horizonte and in the state. As a result of vast popular support, the fans came to be collectively known as &quot;A Massa&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;the mass&quot;). According to a 2014 survey conducted by IBOPE and &quot;Lance!&quot;, the club is the second best-supported in Belo Horizonte and in Minas Gerais and has the eighth largest fanbase in Brazil, with over five million supporters.

Atlético has many &quot;torcidas organizadas&quot; that support the club, the oldest being &quot;Dragões da FAO&quot;, founded in 1969, and the largest and best-known being &quot;Galoucura&quot;. Other notable groups include &quot;Galö Metal&quot;, &quot;Movimento 105 Minutos&quot; and the &quot;Charanga&quot;, a brass band that plays during the club&#x27;s home matches. Galoucura has historically developed alliances with other &quot;torcidas&quot; in Brazil, most notably Palmeiras&#x27;s &quot;Mancha Verde&quot; and Vasco da Gama&#x27;s &quot;Força Jovem&quot;. After difficult but successful comebacks in 2013 and 2014, the fans have adopted the motto &quot;Eu acredito&quot; (&quot;I believe&quot;) to support the club in against-the-odds situations. Squad number 12 is retired from the club&#x27;s kits and dedicated to the fans.

Atlético has had the best average attendance in nine editions of the Série A since 1972, and has the second highest all-time average attendance in Brazilian football. The club also ranks second in all-time total attendance in the national league, with more than 13 million tickets sold in 581 home matches as of the 2014 season. The second leg of the 2013 Copa Libertadores finals between Atlético and Olimpia, played at the Mineirão and attended by 58,620 people, had the highest gate receipt revenue of all time in South American football, yielding million (€4.8 million at the time).

In 1999, the club introduced &quot;Galo de Prata&quot; (&quot;Silver Rooster&quot;), a trophy officially awarded by Atlético to sportspeople, illustrious supporters, artists, politicians, and organisations that somehow promote the club&#x27;s name. Since the implementation of municipal and state laws in 2007 and 2008, &quot;Dia do Atleticano&quot; (&quot;Atleticano Day&quot;) is officially celebrated in Belo Horizonte and Minas Gerais every year on 25 March, the day of the club&#x27;s foundation. Atlético launched TV Galo in 2007, a premium television channel that provides content for fans such as interviews with players and staff, coverage of training sessions and matches, footballing news, and other themed programming. Since 2012, the club has an affiliation programme called &quot;Galo na Veia&quot;, in which supporters can become season ticket holders or pay an annual or monthly fees to buy match tickets at reduced price.

==Rivalries==
The local rivalry between Atlético and Cruzeiro, known as the &quot;Clássico Mineiro&quot; (&quot;Mineiro Derby&quot;), started years after the latter&#x27;s foundation as Società Sportiva Palestra Italia in 1921. It strengthened in the 1940s and became the biggest derby in Minas Gerais in the 1960s. Atlético dominated the rivalry from its early days until the late 1950s, Cruzeiro rose in the 1960s to be a strong challenger and the 1970s had divided honours. The 1980s were favourable to Atlético, whilst the 1990s and 2000s were dominated by Cruzeiro. The 2010s have the rivals competing at an even level. The 2020s have been favourable to Atlético, partly due to its local rivals&#x27; three years in a row in relegation level of Brazilian national football. The clubs dissent over the number of matches and head-to-head record of the &quot;Clássico Mineiro&quot;, but both teams&#x27; statistics show Atlético with most wins in the encounter: 518 matches, 210 wins, 138 draws and 171 losses (as of June 2023). The only national final between the two clubs happened in the 2014 Copa do Brasil, when Atlético triumphed in a final match played at Mineirão. The &quot;Clássico Mineiro&quot;&#x27;s most extreme result was an Atlético 9–2 Cruzeiro win in the 1927 Campeonato Mineiro.

The derby between Atlético and América was known as the &quot;Clássico das Multidões&quot; (&quot;Derby of the Masses&quot;), before Mineirão was built. America dominated the early years of the encounter, winning ten consecutive Campeonato Mineiro titles from 1916 to 1925. In the 1930s, Atlético pioneered professionalization of football in Minas Gerais, whereas América resisted against it. From that time on, Galo became the major force between the two, with América suffering a setback as a result of its internal disagreements regarding professionalism.

Atlético also holds a rivalry with Flamengo of Rio de Janeiro, with the first match between the clubs being played in 1929. Until regular national competitions were introduced in Brazilian football in 1959, however, the encounters were played at friendly level, since the clubs are from different states. The rivalry developed in the 1980s, rising from numerous tendentious events and controversial encounters between the two clubs in Campeonato Brasileiro and Copa Libertadores editions of the period. It remained through the following decades and is considered the biggest interstate rivalry in Brazilian football.

==Records and statistics==

João Leite holds Atlético&#x27;s official appearance record, with 684 matches in all competitions. Reinaldo is the club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer, with 255 goals, since joining the first squad in 1973. In the 1977 season, he scored 28 goals in 18 appearances, setting the club record for the most Campeonato Brasileiro goals in a season, and the league&#x27;s best average goal-per-game record (1.55). Dadá Maravilha is second in total goals, with 211, and the only other Atlético player to score over 200 goals. Argentine striker Lucas Pratto is Atlético&#x27;s all-time top foreign goalscorer, with 41 goals. Telê Santana is Galo&#x27;s longest-serving head coach, having taken charge of the team for 434 matches during three periods in the 1970s and 1980s. Nelson Campos is the club&#x27;s longest-serving president, with nine years in the office in three terms.

The first official game in which Atlético participated was against Yale for the 1915 Campeonato Mineiro, which the team won 5–0. The biggest victory ever recorded by Galo was 13–0, against Calafate in the 1927 Campeonato Mineiro. In the national league, the biggest win came against Desportiva Ferroviária – 7–1 in the 1982 season. Atlético&#x27;s biggest win in the Copa do Brasil, 11–0 against Caiçara in 1991, is also the competition&#x27;s record victory. The club&#x27;s home attendance record – split-crowd derbies excepted – is 115,142, in a friendly against Flamengo at the Mineirão, in 1980. The record attendance in official matches is 113,749, achieved in a match against Santos for the 1983 Brasileirão. Atlético holds the Brazilian record for longest unbeaten run at home, with 54 matches from 2011 to 2013, with 44 wins and 10 draws. The signing of André from Dynamo Kyiv in 2012 is the club&#x27;s most expensive purchase, costing around €8 million, while the record sale is the transfer of Bernard to Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, which cost the Ukrainian club €25 million.

==Organization and finances==
As is the case for most Brazilian football clubs, Atlético Mineiro&#x27;s by-law defines the club as a not-for-profit public utility organization, formed by associates (&quot;sócios&quot;). The club&#x27;s administrative powers are the General Assembly, the Deliberative Council, the Board, the Fiscal Council and the Ethics and Discipline Council. The General Assembly, composed of all associates, elects the Deliberative Council among its members every three years, which in turn elects and removes the club&#x27;s Board, responsible for the executive management of the club. Season ticket-holders and participants of the &quot;Galo na Veia&quot; affiliation programme, called &quot;sócios-torcedores&quot;, are not full club associates and cannot vote or be elected.

A study conducted by BDO in 2016 indicated that the club had a brand value of million (€143 million), making it the eighth most valuable in Brazil. In terms of annual turnover, Atlético ranked seventh in the country in 2015, earning R$244.6 million (€62.2 million), which represented a 37 per cent increase compared to the previous year. The club has a main sponsorship deal with Caixa Econômica Federal, worth R$12.5 million (€3.2 million) annually. Its kit sponsorship deal with Dryworld, worth R$20 million (€5.1 million) per year, is the third biggest in the country.

The club&#x27;s gross debt as of 2015 was R$496.5 million (€126.6 million), the third largest in Brazil, with a R$11.9 million (€3 million) deficit in the same year. The club&#x27;s balance sheet in that year stated it experienced operational losses, and according to a study by Itaú BBA, Atlético operates in a dangerous &quot;financial all-in&quot;. The majority of the club&#x27;s debt is owed to the Federal Government of Brazil, totaling R$286.6 million (€89.1 million); in 2015, Atlético and other clubs joined a government program for debt financing.

==In popular culture==
Atlético Mineiro and episodes in the club&#x27;s history have appeared on films and other media. The music video for &quot;É Uma Partida de Futebol&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s a Football Match&quot;), by Brazilian rock band Skank, was filmed during a 1997 &quot;Clássico Mineiro&quot; match between Atlético and Cruzeiro; the video won three categories at the 1997 MTV Video Music Brazil awards. An Atlético match was also depicted in a Martian Manhunter comic book, by DC Comics, in 2015. The protagonist in &quot;Memories of the Desert&quot;, a 2014 Brazilian crime drama film, is a supporter of the club (as is the actor who portrayed him, Daniel de Oliveira).

A short film about goalkeeper Victor&#x27;s iconic penalty-kick save against Tijuana in the 2013 Copa Libertadores was released in 2014; named &quot;A Dream You Dream Together Is Reality&quot;, it was awarded the &quot;Guirlande D&#x27;Honneur&quot; by the FICTS at the &quot;Sport Movies &amp; TV - Milano International FICTS Fest&quot;. In the following year, &quot;O Dia do Galo&quot;, a documentary that followed five Atlético supporters on the day of the final match of the same competition, was released in theatres as a feature film. The motion picture was one of the most watched Brazilian films of 2015, and won the Popular Jury award at the Mostra de Cinema de Tiradentes. &quot;O Imortal do Gelo&quot;, a film about the club&#x27;s 1950 tour to Europe, was released in 2015. Another film called &quot;Lutar, Lutar, Lutar&quot; was released in 2021 and it focuses on the club&#x27;s history and honours, while also remembering the tendentious decisions against the club in the 1980s.

==Honours==

Atlético Mineiro&#x27;s first trophy was the Taça Bueno Brandão, won in 1914. The club was the first winner of the Campeonato Mineiro, the state league of Minas Gerais, a competition it has won a record 49 times; it has also won the Taça Minas Gerais, a state cup, on five occasions. At national level, Atlético has won the Campeonato Brasileiro three times, while finishing second on five seasons; and also won the Copa do Brasil twice, winning their second titles of both the two major national tournaments in the same year of 2021. It has also won the Copa dos Campeões Brasileiros once. In international competitions, Atlético has won the Copa Libertadores and the Recopa Sudamericana once each, and a record two Copa CONMEBOL trophies; the club has also finished as runner-up of the Copa CONMEBOL, the Copa de Oro and the Copa Master de CONMEBOL. The club has competed in the FIFA Club World Cup once, finishing in third place. The club&#x27;s most recent title is the 2023 Campeonato Mineiro.

==Other departments==
===Futsal===
Atlético Mineiro opened its futsal department in the 1960s, achieving victories at state level in the following decades, and winning the Taça Brasil in 1985. In the late 1990s, the team, named Atlético Pax de Minas for sponsorship reasons, was prominent at national and international level. With players such as Manoel Tobias, Falcão and Lenísio in the squad, Atlético won the Brazilian Liga Futsal twice, in 1997 and 1999, and the Intercontinental Futsal Cup in 1998, finishing as runner-up of both competitions in 2000. In the second leg of the 1999 Liga Futsal finals against Rio de Janeiro, the attendance at Mineirinho was 25,713, a world record in the sport. In 2000, the sponsorship deal with Pax de Minas ended and Atlético&#x27;s professional senior futsal team folded in the following year, with the youth sectors remaining. The club&#x27;s futsal department ceased operations in 2009.

=== American football ===
In March 2018, the club announced the creation of an American football team, a three-year partnership with Grupo Sada and BH Eagles, named Galo Futebol Americano. In its first season playing with this name in the Superliga Nacional de Futebol Americano, Brazil&#x27;s American football league, the team won the Southeast Conference undefeated, and proceeded to win all matches in the playoffs, including the Brasil Bowl against João Pessoa Espectros.

===Olympic sports===
Atlético Mineiro had departments for other Olympic sports throughout its history, with the athletics and volleyball ones achieving notability. In 1983, runner João da Mata won the São Silvestre road race as an Atlético athlete. In 2007, Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot and Alice Timbilil won the male and female categories of the same race, and celebrated their victory with Atlético flags. The club&#x27;s board stated that the athletes had been sponsored as a marketing strategy. Atlético&#x27;s men&#x27;s volleyball department won the Minas Gerais Volleyball Championship a total of twelve times, ranking second in the state for most titles. The team had an especially successful period in the early 1980s, under the administrative management of Alexandre Kalil, who became club president in 2009.

<doc id="187306" wikidata="Q335788" url="?curid=187306" title="Kevin Rowland">
<text>Kevin Rowland (born 17 August 1953) is a British singer and musician best known as the frontman for the pop band Dexys Midnight Runners (currently called Dexys). The band had several hits in the early 1980s, the most notable being &quot;Geno&quot; and &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;, both of which reached number one on the UK Singles Chart.

==Early life==
Rowland was born in Wednesfield, Staffordshire (now Wolverhampton), on 17 August 1953 to Irish parents from Crossmolina, County Mayo, Ireland, and he lived for three years in Ireland from the age of one year old before returning to Wolverhampton. The family moved to Harrow when he was 11 and he left school aged 15.

Before his music career, Rowland worked as a hairdresser.

==Career==
Rowland&#x27;s first group, Lucy &amp; the Lovers, were influenced by Roxy Music and turned out to be short-lived. His next project, the punk rock act the Killjoys, were slightly more successful, releasing the single &quot;Johnny Won&#x27;t Get To Heaven&quot; in 1977.

Alienated by the punk scene, Rowland, together with Killjoys guitarist Kevin Archer, formed a new soul-influenced group, Dexys Midnight Runners. Many of the group&#x27;s songs were inspired by Rowland&#x27;s Irish ancestry and were recognisable through Rowland&#x27;s idiosyncratic vocal style. On forming the band Rowland thought it was &quot;important to have a vocal style&quot;, he later recalled, &quot;and I had the idea of putting that &#x27;crying&#x27; voice on&quot;, partly inspired by General Johnson of Chairmen of the Board. The band had several hit singles, such as &quot;Come On Eileen&quot; (1982).

At the end of the 1980s, Rowland wanted to explore different songwriting, and Dexys Midnight Runners began recording more &quot;introspective, mournful&quot; music. The new material was unsuccessful; Dexys Midnight Runners were dropped by their label and disbanded. Rowland said: &quot;I&#x27;d been too confident, too arrogant. I thought everyone would hear our new music and go: &#x27;Wow.&#x27;&quot; He became reliant on drugs, lost his money, and entered rehab.

When Dexys disbanded in 1987, Rowland recorded a solo album, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, which, together with its three singles, was a commercial failure. His next release was not until 1999 when he recorded a collection of interpretations of classic songs called &quot;My Beauty&quot;, the album cover of which depicted a heavily made-up Rowland in a dress and lingerie.

In 2003, Rowland reformed Dexys Midnight Runners—featuring only one other original member, bassist Pete Williams, who fulfilled the role as Rowland&#x27;s co-vocalist—and embarked on a successful comeback tour backed up with a greatest hits compilation album including two newly recorded songs, &quot;Manhood&quot; and &quot;My Life in England&quot;. Both of these new songs were radio tested by the record label, but neither received enough airplay to be considered for release.

In 2012 Rowland re-launched Dexys Midnight Runners as &quot;Dexys&quot; with a new album &quot;One Day I&#x27;m Going to Soar&quot; accompanied by a UK tour. Rowland has always identified strongly with his Irish background and in 2016 Dexys released their fifth album, &quot;Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul&quot;, featuring interpretations of Irish folk songs such as &quot;Women of Ireland&quot; and &quot;Carrickfergus&quot;, among others.

Since around 2005, Rowland has hosted a popular DJ tour in clubs and venues throughout the UK. His eclectic set includes his personal favourites, vintage soul and pop numbers from such notables as T-Rex, Roxy Music, and Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes.

In summer of 2020 Rowland released a new video for the song &quot;Rag Doll&quot;, a promo which features his grandson Roo. In September 2020, &quot;My Beauty&quot; was re-released by Cherry Red Records and finally became a UK chart hit in October, peaking at number 73 in the albums chart.

<text>Richard Ford (born February 16, 1944) is an American novelist and short story author, and writer of a series of novels featuring the character Frank Bascombe.

Ford&#x27;s first collection of short stories, &quot;Rock Springs&quot;, was published in 1987.

In the United States, Ford received the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for his novel &quot;Independence Day&quot;. In Spain, he won the Princess of Asturias Award for 2016. In 2018, Ford received the Park Kyong-ni Prize, an international literary award from South Korea.

His novel &quot;Wildlife&quot; was adapted into a 2018 film of the same name, and in 2023 Ford published &quot;Be Mine&quot;, his fifth work of fiction chronicling the life of Frank Bascombe.

==Early life==
Ford was born in Jackson, Mississippi, the only son of Parker Carrol and Edna Ford. Parker was a traveling salesman for Faultless Starch, a Kansas City company. Of his mother, Ford said, &quot;Her ambition was to be, first, in love with my father and, second, to be a full-time mother.&quot; When Ford was eight years old, his father had a severe heart failure, and thereafter Ford spent as much time with his grandfather, a former prizefighter and hotel owner in Little Rock, Arkansas, as he did with his parents in Mississippi. Ford&#x27;s father died of a second heart attack in 1960. In Jackson, Ford lived across the street from the home of author Eudora Welty.

Ford&#x27;s grandfather had worked for a railroad. At the age of 19, before deciding to attend college, Ford began work on the Missouri Pacific train line as a locomotive engineer&#x27;s assistant, learning the work while doing the job.

Ford received a B.A. degree from Michigan State University. Having enrolled to study hotel management, he switched to English. After graduating, he taught junior high school in Flint, Michigan, and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps but was discharged after contracting hepatitis. At university he met Kristina Hensley, his future wife and they married in 1968.

Despite mild dyslexia, Ford developed a serious interest in literature. He has stated in interviews that his dyslexia may have helped him as a reader since it forced him to read books slowly and thoughtfully.

Ford briefly attended law school but quit and participated with the creative writing program at the University of California, Irvine, to pursue a Master of Fine Arts degree, which he received in 1970. Ford chose this course simply because &quot;they admitted me. I remember getting the application for Iowa and thinking they&#x27;d never have let me in. I&#x27;m sure I was right about that too. But typical of me, I didn&#x27;t know who was teaching at Irvine. I didn&#x27;t know it was important to know such things. I wasn&#x27;t the most curious of young men, even though I give myself credit for not letting that deter me.&quot; Actually, Oakley Hall and E. L. Doctorow were teaching there and Ford has acknowledged they influenced him. In 1971, he was selected for a three-year appointment in the University of Michigan Society of Fellows.

==Early career==
Ford published his first novel, &quot;A Piece of My Heart&quot;, the story of two unlikely drifters whose paths cross on an island in the Mississippi River, during 1976, and followed it with &quot;The Ultimate Good Luck&quot; during 1981. During the interim he briefly taught at Williams College and Princeton University. Despite good notices, the books sold little, and Ford retired from fiction writing to become a writer for the New York magazine &quot;Inside Sports&quot;. &quot;I realized,&quot; Ford said, &quot;there was probably a wide gulf between what I could do and what would succeed with readers. I felt that I&#x27;d had a chance to write two novels, and neither of them had really created much stir, so maybe I should find real employment, and earn my keep.&quot;

During 1982, the magazine was terminated, and when &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; did not hire Ford, he resumed writing fiction, composing &quot;The Sportswriter&quot;, about a failed novelist turned sportswriter who undergoes an emotional crisis after the death of his son. It was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s five best books of 1986 and was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. Ford followed up that success with &quot;Rock Springs&quot; (1987), a story collection —set mostly in Montana —that includes what remain some of his most anthologized short stories.

==Mid-career and acclaim==
Ford&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;Wildlife&quot;, a story of a Montana golf professional turned firefighter, met with mixed reviews and middling sales, but by the end of the 1990s Ford was increasingly sought after as an editor and contributor to various projects. Ford edited the 1990 &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot;, the 1992 &quot;Granta Book of the American Short Story&quot;, the Fall 1996 &quot;fiction issue&quot; of &quot;Ploughshares&quot;, and the 1998 &quot;Granta Book of the American Long Story&quot;. In the latter volume&#x27;s &quot;Introduction,&quot; Ford stipulated that he preferred the designation &quot;long story&quot; instead of the term &quot;novella.&quot; For the publishing project Library of America, Ford edited a two-volume edition of the selected works of the Mississippi writer Eudora Welty, which was published during 1998.

During 1995, Ford published the novel &quot;Independence Day&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Sportswriter&quot;, featuring the continued story of its protagonist, Frank Bascombe. Reviews were positive, and the novel became the first to win both the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. During the same year, Ford was chosen as winner of the Rea Award for the Short Story, for outstanding achievement for that genre. He ended the 1990s with a well-received collection of short stories, &quot;Women With Men&quot;, published during 1997. The &quot;Paris Review&quot; termed him a &quot;master&quot; of the short story genre.

==Later life and writings==

Ford lived for many years in New Orleans in the French Quarter, on lower Bourbon Street then in the Garden District of the same city, where his wife, Kristina, was the executive director of the city planning commission. For a while Ford and his wife resided in East Boothbay, Maine. As of 2023, Ford lives in Billings, Montana where he bought a house. During the intervening years, Ford lived in other locations, usually in the United States, as he pursued a peripatetic teaching career.

He obtained a teaching appointment at Bowdoin College during 2005 but kept the job for only one semester. During 2008 Ford was an adjunct professor of the Oscar Wilde Centre with the School of English at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, teaching in the Masters programme in creative writing. Starting December 29, 2010, Ford assumed the job of senior fiction professor at the University of Mississippi during the autumn of 2011, replacing Barry Hannah, who died during March 2010. During the autumn of 2012, he became the Emmanuel Roman and Barrie Sardoff Roman Professor of the Humanities and Professor of Writing at the Columbia University School of the Arts.

As the new century commenced, he published another story collection, &quot;A Multitude of Sins&quot; (2002), followed by the novels &quot;The Lay Of The Land,&quot; —the third in his Bascombe series— in 2006 and &quot;Canada&quot;, published during May 2012. According to Ford, &quot;The Lay Of The Land&quot; completed his series of Bascombe novels but &quot;Canada&quot; was a stand-alone novel.

In April 2013, Ford read from a new Frank Bascombe story without revealing to the audience whether it was part of a longer work. By 2014, it was confirmed that the story was to appear in the book &quot;Let Me Be Frank With You&quot;, published during November of that year. The latter work consists of four interconnected novellas (or &quot;long stories&quot;), all narrated by Frank Bascombe. &quot;Let Me Be Frank With You&quot; was a finalist for the 2015 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. It did not win the prize but the selection committee praised the book for its &quot;unflinching series of narratives, set in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, insightfully portraying a society in decline.&quot;

As in the preceding decade, Ford continued to assist with various editing projects. During 2007, he edited the &quot;New Granta Book of the American Short Story&quot; and in 2011 he edited &quot;Blue Collar, White Collar, No Collar: Stories of Work&quot;. During May 2017, Ford published a memoir, &quot;Between Them: Remembering My Parents&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;Wildlife&quot; was adapted into a film of the same name by director Paul Dano and screenwriter Zoe Kazan. It was released to widespread critical acclaim.

In 2020, Ford&#x27;s short story collection, &quot;Sorry For Your Trouble&quot;, was published. His novel, &quot;Be Mine&quot;, was published in June 2023 and is the fifth
—and presumably final— book in Ford&#x27;s so-called &quot;Bascombe series.&quot;

==Reception==
Ford began publishing his short stories in the 1980s, which corresponded with an American renaissance in the short story that centered around Raymond Carver (1938–1988). So there was a tendency early on to associate Ford&#x27;s stories in &quot;Rock Springs&quot; with minimalism and its offshoot, an aesthetic style known as &quot;Dirty realism&quot; that referred to Carver&#x27;s lower-middle-class subjects or the protagonists Ford portrays in &quot;Rock Springs&quot;. &quot;Dirty realism&quot; and &quot;minimalism&quot; came to be associated with a long list of writers during the 1970s and 1980s, including Tobias Wolff, Ann Beattie, Frederick Barthelme, Larry Brown, Jayne Anne Phillips, and Gordon Lish.

However, many of the characters in the novels about Frank Bascombe (&quot;The Sportswriter&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;The Lay of the Land&quot;, &quot;Let Me Be Frank With You&quot;, &quot;Be Mine&quot;), including the protagonist, enjoy degrees of material affluence and cultural capital not normally associated with dirty realism.

Ford&#x27;s writing demonstrates &quot;a meticulous concern for the nuances of language ... [and] the rhythms of phrases and sentences&quot;. He has described his sense of language as &quot;a source of pleasure in itself—- all of its corporeal qualities, its syncopations, moods, sounds, the way things look on the page&quot;. Besides this &quot;devotion to language&quot; is what he terms &quot;the fabric of affection that holds people close enough together to survive&quot;.

Comparisons have been drawn between Ford&#x27;s work and the writings of John Updike, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and Walker Percy. Ford resists such comparisons, commenting, &quot;You can&#x27;t write ... on the strength of influence. You can only write a good story or a good novel by yourself.&quot;

Ford&#x27;s works of fiction &quot;dramatize the breakdown of such cultural institutions as marriage, family, and community,&quot; and his &quot;marginalized protagonists often typify the rootlessness and nameless longing ... pervasive in a highly mobile, present-oriented society in which individuals, having lost a sense of the past, relentlessly pursue their own elusive identities in the here and now.&quot; Ford &quot;looks to art, rather than religion, to provide consolation and redemption in a chaotic time.&quot;

==Controversies==
Ford once sent Alice Hoffman a copy of one of her books with bullet holes in it after she angered him by unfavorably reviewing &quot;The Sportswriter&quot;.

In 2004, Ford spat on Colson Whitehead when encountering him at a party two years after Whitehead published a negative review of &quot;A Multitude of Sins&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Thirteen years later, Ford remained unrepentant. Writing in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 2017, Ford declared that &quot;as of today, I don&#x27;t feel any different about Mr. Whitehead, or his review, or my response.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Suomussalmi was fought between Finnish and Soviet forces in the Winter War. The action took place from 30 November 1939 to 8 January 1940. The outcome was a Finnish victory against superior forces. This battle is considered the clearest, most important, and most significant Finnish victory in the northern half of Finland. In Finland, the battle is still seen today as a symbol of the entirety of the Winter War itself.
==Order of Battle==
===Soviet army===
9th Army
* 163rd Rifle Division
* Parts of 47th Rifle Corps
* 44th Rifle Division
===Finish army===
North Finland Group
* Susi Group (Ryhmä Susi) 
* Siilasvuo Group
* 9th Infantry Division

==Course of battle==

On 30 November 1939, Zelentsov leading the Soviet 163rd Rifle Division (the 81st and Sharov&#x27;s 662nd Infantry Regiments with tanks and cavalry) left Ukhta and crossed the border near Juntusranta, while the 759th Infantry Regiment and Division reconnaissance battalion crossed at Raate, as the Soviets advanced towards Suomussalmi. The Soviet objective was to advance to the city of Oulu, effectively cutting Finland in half. At the road connecting Peranka with Hyrynsalmi, the 662nd turned north intending to capture Peranka, while the 81st regiment turned south to join the 759th in attacking Suomussalmi. On 4 December, the Finnish Independent battalion (ErP 15) and the 4th Field Replacement Battalion fought the Soviets from Raate to Suomussalmi, but Suomussalmi was captured on 7 December. On 6 December, I. Pallari&#x27;s ErP 16 stopped the Soviet advance on Peranka at the Piispajärvi straits. Paavo Susitaival took over command of Task Force Susi north and east of the Palovaara juntion, while Salske took command of ErP 16 after Pallari was wounded.

By 9 December the Hjalmar Siilasvuo&#x27;s Regiment JR 27 had arrived, stopping the Soviet advance towards Hyrynsalmi at a ferry just south of Suomussalmi. By the 11th, JR 27 ha severed the Soviet Raate road communication link to the east of Suomussalmi. A Finnish battalion then cut off Soviet communications at Hulkonniemi, northwest of Suomussalmi. Over the next two weeks, Siilasvuo was able to contain the Soviets, while Finnish artillery arrived. On 25 December, Siilasvuo&#x27;s forces were reorganized as the 9th Division, with the addition of Regiment JR 64, guerilla battalion Sissi P1, and bicycle battalion PPP 6. On 27 December, Task Force Susi, reinforced by Regiment JR 65, captured Palovaara, preventing the Soviet 662nd Regiment from supporting the rest of the 163rd Division.

On 21 December, Mäkinen led Finnish raiding parties in attacking Vinogradov&#x27;s 44th Motorized Infantry Division advancing along Battle of Raate Road.

On 24 December, surrounded on all sides in the Hulkonniemi-Suomussalmi area, Zelentsov tried to break out to the south, but was stopped by JR 27&#x27;s Second Battalion. On 25 December, the Soviets tried to break out to the west, but were once again stopped. On 27 December, Siilasvuo made his move, with Kaarle Kari attacking from the northwest along columns led by Frans Fagernäs and Martti Harola, while Battalion PPP 6 struck from the north, and Paavola prevented any northern movement along Lake Kiantajärvi.

On 28 December, around 9 A.M., according to Chew, &quot;Russian resistance suddenly collapsed in front of Fagernäs, the men bolted from their positions, some towards Suomussalmi village, others onto the ice of Lake Kiantajärvi - a few throwing away their weapons in their haste. This retreat sealed the fate of te 163rd Division, although the battle continued against its remnants for two more days. The 163rd Division no longer existed - there were only a few hundred cold, hungry, frightened men who abandoned their weapons and fled in panic towards the Soviet border beyond Juntusranta, some 20 miles to the northeast. The rout developed into a slaughter...&quot;

==Outcome==

The battle resulted in a major victory for the Finns. If the Soviet Union had captured the city of Oulu, the Finns would have had to defend the country on two fronts and an important rail link to Sweden would have been severed. The battle also gave a decisive boost to the morale of the Finnish army.

In addition, Finnish forces on the Raate-Suomussalmi road captured a large amount of military supplies, including tanks (43), field guns (70), trucks (278), horses (1,170), anti-tank guns (29), machine guns (300), rifles (6000) and other weapons, which were greatly needed by the Finnish army.

Alvar Aalto sculpted a memorial for the Finnish soldiers who died.
==Casualties==
Soviet troops suffered heavy losses, but estimates on the severity of these losses vary depending on the source. Multiple estimates report 22,500 to 27,000 Soviet casualties. American historian Allen Chew estimated the total Soviet losses at 22,500. Another estimate lists 27,000 killed and 2,100 captured.

In Russian historiography, until the collapse of the USSR, the issue of losses was not covered in any way. Pavel Aptekar was one of the first to touch upon the issue of losses; however, his data does not reflect the full picture of the battle, but they call the losses of the 44th division to be, according to him, 4,000 people and 80 tanks. Ten years later, an article by another historian, Oleg Kiselev, was published, which tracked the dynamics of losses of all formations during the battle. As a result, he came to this conclusion:
==Analysis==
The Battle of Suomussalmi is often cited as an example of how a small force, properly led and fighting in familiar terrain, can defeat a vastly numerically superior enemy. Factors which contributed to the Finnish victory included:

*Finnish troops possessed higher mobility due to skis and sleds; by contrast, Soviet heavy equipment confined them to roads.
*The Soviet objective to cut Finland in half across the Oulu region, while appearing reasonable on a map, was inherently unrealistic, as the region was mostly forested marshland, with its road network consisting mainly of logging trails. Mechanized divisions had to rely on them and so became easy targets for the mobile Finnish ski troops.
*Finnish strategy was flexible and often unorthodox, for example, Finnish troops targeted Soviet field kitchens, which demoralised Soviet soldiers fighting in a sub-Arctic winter.
*The Soviet army was poorly equipped, especially with regard to winter camouflage clothing; by contrast, Finnish troops&#x27; equipment were well-suited for warfare in deep snow and freezing temperatures.
*The Finnish army had very high morale, resulting from the fact that it was defending their nation. Soviet troops, however, had exclusively-political reasons for their attack, consequently losing their will to fight soon despite continual efforts by Soviet propagandists.
*An additional factor remained Soviet counter-intelligence failures: Finnish troops often intercepted the Soviet communications, which relied heavily on standard phone lines.
*The Finnish tactics involved simplicity where needed, as the final assault was a simple head-on charge, which decreased the chances of tactical errors. Rough weather also favoured comparatively-simple plans.

<text>Esporte Clube Vitória is a Brazilian professional club based in Salvador, Bahia founded on 13 May 1899. It competes in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, as well as in the Campeonato Baiano, the top flight of the Bahia state football league.

Vitória&#x27;s home games are played at the club&#x27;s own stadium, Manoel Barradas, capacity 35,632. The team plays in red and black horizontal striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. The stripes have changed over time: they have been sometimes vertical, horizontal, wide and narrow.

The youth system of the club is one of the most successful of the world, holding, between 1995 and 2000, at its peak, at least 21 international titles. Recent names that started playing in the club are Bebeto, Vampeta, Dida, Júnior, Hulk, David Luiz, Dudu Cearense, Marcelo Moreno, Gabriel Paulista and others.

The rivals of Vitória are Esporte Clube Bahia. Their matches are known as Ba–Vi (&quot;Ba&quot; from &quot;Esporte Clube&quot; &quot;Bahia&quot; and &quot;Vi&quot; from &quot;Esporte Clube Vitória&quot;). It is one of the most intense rivalries, consistently ranked among the world&#x27;s most bitter.

==History==
The club was founded on 13 May 1899, by the brothers Artur and Artêmio Valente, along with seventeen other young fellows. They were from an old Bahia family, and discovered football during their studies in England. Initially Vitória was a cricket club, named Club de Cricket Victoria, because all of them lived at the Vitória neighborhood, in Salvador.

On 22 May 1901, Vitória played its first football match, at Campo da Pólvora, against International Sport Club, a team whose players were English seamen. Vitória beat International 3–2. Two months after that match, Vitória changed its original colors, which were black and white, to red and black, which are still in use.

On 13 September 1903, Vitória beat a club formed by people from São Paulo state, São Paulo Bahia Football Club 2–0 in the club&#x27;s first official match. In 1908, Vitória won its first title ever, the Campeonato Baiano. They won the next year as well.

From 1910 to 1952, they didn&#x27;t win any titles because they were still an amateur club. In 1953, the club turned professional, and won its third Baiano honor. Bahia was dominating the state championship, and Vitória only won titles in 1955, 1957, 1964, 1965, 1972, 1980, 1985 and 1989.

The club was runner-up in the 1993 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A to Palmeiras, with an extremely small payroll. Vitória was champion of Bahia in 1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2000, becoming the top club of the state for the first time. In the 1999 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Vitória reached the semi-finals.

In the 2000s, the Campeonato Baiano trophy was won by Vitória eight out of ten years.

In 2004 Vitória, after a poor campaign, was relegated to the Brazilian Second Division. In 2005, the club competed in the Brazilian second division, finishing 17th, and so was relegated to the Third Division for the first time in its history.

In 2006, Vitória was runner-up of the third division, and was promoted to the Brazilian second division. In 2007, the club was promoted back to the first division after finishing in fourth place. This meant the club had managed to return from the lowest Brazilian national division to its original place in the first division in only two years.

In February 2018 the intense rivalry between Vitória and Esporte Clube Bahia drew international attention when nine players (four from Bahia and five from Vitória) were shown the red card in a State Championship match.

==Mascot==
The club&#x27;s mascot is a lion named Lelê Leão (Lion), and according to Vitória&#x27;s official site, his objective is to stimulate the club&#x27;s supporters and players on match days.

==Competitions record==

==Colours==
Its colours are red and black, which made it to be called &quot;Rubro-Negro&quot; (&quot;red-black&quot;, in portuguese). In the early years, the club&#x27;s colours would be green and yellow, but due to difficulty in find the proper materials in these colours, it was chosen to be white and black. That was the colours worn in the inaugural match facing the International Sport Club. The current red-black colours were adopted 3 years later, in 1902.

Many kinds of shirts have been worn by Vitória&#x27;s players over the years.

<text>Max Carl Friedrich Beckmann (February 12, 1884 – December 27, 1950) was a German painter, draftsman, printmaker, sculptor, and writer. Although he is classified as an Expressionist artist, he rejected both the term and the movement. In the 1920s, he was associated with the New Objectivity (&quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot;), an outgrowth of Expressionism that opposed its introverted emotionalism. Even when dealing with light subject matter like circus performers, Beckmann often had an undercurrent of moodiness or unease in his works. By the 1930s, his work became more explicit in its horrifying imagery and distorted forms with combination of brutal realism and social criticism, coinciding with the rise of Nazism in Germany.

==Life==
Max Beckmann was born into a middle-class family in Leipzig, Saxony. From his youth he pitted himself against the old masters. His traumatic experiences of World War I, in which he volunteered as a medical orderly, coincided with a dramatic transformation of his style from academically correct depictions to a distortion of both figure and space, reflecting his altered vision of himself and humanity.

He is known for the self-portraits painted throughout his life, their number and intensity rivaled only by those of Rembrandt and Picasso. Well-read in philosophy and literature, Beckmann also contemplated mysticism and theosophy in search of the &quot;Self&quot;. As a true painter-thinker, he strove to find the hidden spiritual dimension in his subjects (Beckmann&#x27;s 1948 &quot;Letters to a Woman Painter&quot; provides a statement of his approach to art).

Beckmann enjoyed great success and official honors during the Weimar Republic. In 1925, he was selected to teach a master class at the Städelschule Academy of Fine Art in Frankfurt. Some of his most famous students included Theo Garve, Leo Maillet and Marie-Louise von Motesiczky. In 1927, he received the Honorary Empire Prize for German Art and the Gold Medal of the City of Düsseldorf; the National Gallery in Berlin acquired his painting &quot;The Bark&quot; and, in 1928, purchased his &quot;Self-Portrait in Tuxedo&quot;. By the early 1930s, a series of major exhibitions, including large retrospectives at the Städtische Kunsthalle Mannheim (1928) and in Basel and Zurich (1930), together with numerous publications, showed the high esteem in which Beckmann was held.

His fortunes changed with the rise to power of Adolf Hitler, whose dislike of Modern Art quickly led to its suppression by the state. In 1933, the Nazi government called Beckmann a &quot;cultural Bolshevik&quot; and dismissed him from his teaching position at the Art School in Frankfurt. In 1937, the government confiscated more than 500 of his works from German museums, putting several on display in the notorious Degenerate Art exhibition in Munich. The day after Hitler&#x27;s radio speech about degenerate art in 1937, Beckmann left Germany with his second wife, Quappi, for the Netherlands.

For ten years, Beckmann lived in self-imposed exile in Amsterdam, failing in his desperate attempts to obtain a visa for the United States. In 1944, the Germans attempted to draft him into the army, although the sixty-year-old artist had suffered a heart attack. The works completed in his Amsterdam studio were even more powerful and intense than the ones of his master years in Frankfurt. They included several large triptychs, which stand as a summation of Beckmann&#x27;s art.

In 1947, Beckmann took a position at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts at Washington University. During the last three years of his life, he taught at Washington University (alongside the German-American painter and printmaker Werner Drewes), and at the Brooklyn Museum. He came to St. Louis at the invitation of Perry T. Rathbone, director of the Saint Louis Art Museum. Rathbone arranged for Washington University to hire Beckmann as an art teacher, filling a vacancy left by Philip Guston, who had taken a leave. The first Beckmann retrospective in the United States took place in 1948 at the City Art Museum, Saint Louis. In St. Louis, Morton D. May became his patron and, already an avid amateur photographer and painter, a student of the artist. May later donated much of his large collection of Beckmann&#x27;s works to the St. Louis Art Museum. Beckmann also helped him learn to appreciate Oceanian and African art. 

After stops in Denver and Chicago, he and Quappi took an apartment at 38 West 69th Street in Manhattan. In 1949 he obtained a professorship at the Brooklyn Museum Art School.

Beckmann suffered from angina pectoris and died after Christmas 1950, struck down by a heart attack at the corner of 69th Street and Central Park West in New York City, not far from his apartment building. As the artist&#x27;s widow recalled, he was on his way to see one of his paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Beckmann had a one-man show at the Venice Biennale of 1950, the year of his death. also in that final year of 1950 he painted the work &quot;Falling Man&quot; which is considered both a reflection on mortality and eerily predictive of the jumpers and other doomed persons falling from the World Trade Center Towers during the September 11 attacks.

==Themes==

Unlike several of his avant-garde contemporaries, Beckmann rejected non-representational painting; instead, he took up and advanced the tradition of figurative painting. He greatly admired not only Cézanne and Van Gogh, but also Blake, Rembrandt, and Rubens, as well as Northern European artists of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, such as Bosch, Bruegel, and Matthias Grünewald. His style and method of composition are partially rooted in the imagery of medieval stained glass.

Engaging with the genres of portraiture, landscape, still life, and history painting, his diverse body of work created a very personal but authentic version of modernism, one with a healthy deference to traditional forms. Beckmann reinvented the religious triptych and expanded this archetype of medieval painting into an allegory of contemporary humanity.

From his beginnings in the fin de siècle to the period after World War II, Beckmann reflected an era of radical changes in both art and history in his work. Many of Beckmann&#x27;s paintings express the agonies of Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Some of his imagery refers to the decadent glamor of the Weimar Republic&#x27;s cabaret culture, but from the 1930s on, his works often contain mythologized references to the brutalities of the Nazis. Beyond these immediate concerns, his subjects and symbols assume a larger meaning, voicing universal themes of terror, redemption, and the mysteries of eternity and fate.

His &quot;Self-Portrait with Horn&quot; (1938), painted during his exile in Amsterdam, demonstrates his use of symbols. Musical instruments are featured in many of his paintings; in this case, a horn that the artist holds as if it were a telescope by which he intends to explore the darkness surrounding him. The tight framing of the figure within the boundaries of the canvas emphasize his entrapment. Art historian Cornelia Stabenow terms the painting &quot;the most melancholy, but also the most mystifying, of his self-portraits&quot;.

==Legacy==

Many of Beckmann&#x27;s late paintings are displayed in American museums. He exerted a profound influence on such American painters as Philip Guston and Nathan Oliveira, and, indeed, on Boston Expressionism, the art movement that later expanded nationally and is now called American Figurative Expressionism. His posthumous reputation perhaps suffered from his very individual artistic path; like Oskar Kokoschka, he defies the convenient categorization that provides themes for critics, art historians and curators. Other than a major retrospective at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Art Institute of Chicago in 1964–65 (with an excellent catalogue by Peter Selz), and MoMA&#x27;s prominent display of the triptych &quot;Departure&quot;, his work was little seen in much of the United States for decades. His 1984 centenary was marked in the New York area only by a modest exhibit at Nassau County&#x27;s suburban art museum. The Saint Louis Art Museum holds the largest public collection of Beckmann paintings in the world and held a major exhibition of his work in 1998.

Since the late 20th century, Beckmann&#x27;s work has gained an increasing international reputation. There have been retrospectives and exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art (1995) and the Guggenheim Museum (1996) in New York, and the principal museums of Rome (1996), Valencia (1996), Madrid (1997), Zurich (1998), Munich (2000), Frankfurt (2006) and Amsterdam (2007). In Spain and Italy, Beckmann&#x27;s work has been accessible to a wider public for the first time. A large-scale Beckmann retrospective was exhibited at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (2002) and Tate Modern in London (2003). In 2011, the Städel in Frankfurt devoted an entire room to the artist in its newly fitted permanent exhibition of modern art.

A Max Beckmann Gesellschaft was first established by Wilhelm Hausenstein, and others. The Max Beckmann Archiv was established in 1977 and is under the auspices of the Bavarian State Painting Collections.

In 1996, Piper, Beckmann&#x27;s German publisher, released the third and last volume of the artist&#x27;s letters, whose wit and vision rank him among the strongest writers of the German tongue. His essays, plays and, above all, his diaries are also unique historical documents. A selection of Beckmann&#x27;s writings was issued in the United States by University of Chicago Press in 1996.

In 2003, Stephan Reimertz, Parisian novelist and art historian, published a biography of Max Beckmann. It presents many photos and sources for the first time. The biography reveals Beckmann&#x27;s contemplations of writers and philosophers such as Dostoyevsky, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Richard Wagner. The book has not yet been translated into English.

In 2015, the Saint Louis Art Museum published &quot;Max Beckmann at the Saint Louis Art Museum: The Paintings&quot;, by Lynette Roth. It is a comprehensive look at the Beckmann paintings at SLAM, the largest collection of them in the world, and places both artist and works in a broader context.

==Art market==
Although Beckmann is considered an important 20th-century artist, he has never been a household name, and his works have mostly appealed to a niche market of German and Austrian collectors. In 1921, Beckmann signed an exclusive contract with the print-dealer J. B. Neumann in Berlin. In 1938, he had the first of numerous exhibitions at Curt Valentin’s Buchholz Gallery, New York. 

Today, Beckmann&#x27;s large paintings routinely sell for more than $1 million, and his self-portraits generally command the highest prices. In 2001, Ronald Lauder paid $22.5 million at Sotheby&#x27;s New York for Beckmann&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait with Horn&quot; (1938), and displayed it at the Neue Galerie in New York. In 2017, an anonymous bidder paid the record sum of $45.8 million for Beckmann&#x27;s &quot;Hölle der Vögel (Birds&#x27; Hell)&quot; (1938) at Christie&#x27;s in London; this was also a new world record for a German Expressionism artwork. In 2022, &quot;Self-Portrait Yellow-Pink&quot; (1943) sold at a Berlin auction for 20 million euros ($20.7 million), a price that appears to be a record for an art auction in Germany.

==Rediscovered works==
Several important works by Beckmann were discovered in the Munich flat of Cornelius Gurlitt in 2012, and are the subject of intense scrutiny by the German police and art historians for their provenance and sale during the Nazi period.

In 1949, Fluminense became the only football club in the world to receive the Olympic Cup, awarded annually by the International Olympic Committee to an institution or association with a record of merit and integrity in actively developing the Olympic Movement. Its best international performances include winning the 2023 Copa Libertadores, winning the 1952 Copa Rio, and reaching the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup final.

Fluminense&#x27;s traditional home kit consists of an iconic combination of three colors: burgundy, white, and green, disposed in vertical stripes, since its adoption in 1904. White shorts and white socks, an outfit which has been in use since 1920, complement the home kit for &quot;O Tricolor&quot;.

The club holds several long-standing rivalries with other clubs, most notably with Flamengo (&quot;Clássico Fla-Flu&quot;), Botafogo (&quot;Clássico Vovô&quot;) and Vasco da Gama (&quot;Clássico dos Gigantes&quot;). The Clássico Fla-Flu in particular is widely considered one of the greatest football derbies in Brazil and South America, having eventually set the world record for the highest attendance in a match between football clubs (over 200,000 spectators in the stadium of Maracanã).

The club is the birthplace of the Brazil national football team, which played its first game amidst the club’s 12th anniversary celebrations. In Fluminense&#x27;s ground, the Estádio de Laranjeiras, the “&quot;Canarinhos”&quot; held their first match, scored their first goal and lifted their first trophy. To this day, the club has contributed the fifth-most players to the national team among all Brazilian clubs.

==History==
=== Rio&#x27;s football pioneering ===
Fluminense Football Club was founded on 21 July 1902, in the neighbourhood of Laranjeiras, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, by a group of young football enthusiasts led by Oscar Cox, an English citizen born in Brazil, who had come into contact with the sport whilst studying in Europe, and Cox was subsequently elected as the first president. Therefore, it was the first football club to be founded in the city, whose most popular sport at the time was rowing.

The first official match was played against now defunct Rio Football Club, and Fluminense won 8–0. The club&#x27;s first title came in 1906, when Fluminense won the state championship (Campeonato Carioca).

In 1911, disagreement between Fluminense players led to the formation of Flamengo&#x27;s football team. The so-called &quot;Fla-Flu&quot; derby is considered one of the biggest in the history of Brazilian football. Three years later, in Fluminense&#x27;s stadium, the Brazil national football team debuted, against touring English club Exeter City. It was also there that they won their debut title, in 1919.

By 1922, Fluminense had 4,000 members, a stadium for 25,000 people, and facilities that impressed clubs in Europe.

=== Construction of Maracanã ===

The 1950 World Cup strengthened football in the country, and as a result, the country&#x27;s biggest teams, which basically only competed in state tournaments, began to measure their strength in tournaments and matches against teams from other states. To hold the competition, the Maracanã was built, the largest stadium in the world at that time, and which became the main stadium for Fluminense&#x27;s games.

In the context of the World Cup held in the country in 1950, CBD, accompanied by FIFA and IFAB, decided to hold a competition that pitted the champion clubs from the main FIFA-affiliated countries against each other, thus creating the &quot;International Champions Club Tournament&quot;, better known as Copa Rio. The competition brought together the Champion clubs from countries in South America (Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland and Yugoslavia), its first edition was in 1951, being won by Palmeiras.

In 1951, Fluminense won the Carioca championship, which meant that the team qualified for the 1952 Copa Rio. The team had great players who represented the Brazilian team, such as Carlos Castilho, Píndaro, Pinheiro, Didi, Orlando Pingo de Ouro and Telê Santana.

In the first phase of the competition, the teams were divided into two groups, the first played their matches at Maracanã, and the second played their matches at Pacaembu, Fluminense was in the first group and faced Grasshopper (Switzerland), Sporting Lisboa (Portugal) and Peñarol (Uruguay), and qualified in first place. In the semi final they beat Austria Wien (Austria), and in the final they defeated Corinthians.

From the 1950s, with the creation of the Rio-São Paulo Tournament, the forerunner of what eventually would become the national championship, Fluminense established itself regionally by winning the tournament title in 1957 and 1960.

=== National achievements ===
From the 1960s onwards, the first national championships were played in Brazil, so that the country could send representatives to the Copa Libertadores. Fluminense&#x27;s first national title came in 1970; At that time, Brazil had the best players in world football, and they all played for Brazilian clubs. Its squad was among the main candidates of the season in Brazil, Fluminense won the Brazilian Championship overcoming other major opponents of the season in Santos, Palmeiras and Cruzeiro.

In the 1970s, Fluminense signed several famous players such as Carlos Alberto Torres, Dirceu, Gil, Narciso Doval, Pintinho and Roberto Rivellino. This team, called &quot;Tricolor Machine&quot;, won the state championship in 1975 and 1976. In the national championship, Fluminense lost in the semifinals to Internacional in 1975 and Corinthians in 1976.

Fluminense became Brazilian champions again in 1984, playing in the final against Rio rivals Vasco da Gama. During the decade, they also won three state championships in a row, in 1983, 1984 and 1985, defeating their main rival Flamengo, in the final of the first two. These titles were won by great players such as Branco, Delei, Edinho, Ricardo Gomes, Romerito and the “Casal Vinte”: Assis and Washington.

At the end of the 1980s, Copa do Brasil was created, inspired by cup tournaments played in European countries. Fluminense reached the final of the Copa do Brasil for the first time in 1992, but lost to Internacional in a penalty shootout, in a controversial match in Porto Alegre.

=== Double relegation and return to the top flight ===
A disastrous campaign led to Fluminense&#x27;s relegation from Brasileirão Série A in 1996. However, a set of off-field political manoeuvres not performed by the club allowed them to remain in Brazil&#x27;s top domestic league, only to be relegated the next year. Completely out of control, the club was relegated from Série B to Série C in 1998. In 1999, Fluminense won the Série C championship and were to be promoted to Série B when they were invited to take part in Copa João Havelange, a championship that replaced the traditional Série A in 2000. In 2001, it was decided that all clubs which took part in Copa João Havelange&#x27;s so-called Blue Group should be kept in Série A.

=== 2000s: Copa do Brasil title, first Libertadores final ===

Fluminense had good campaigns in the 2000, 2001, and 2002 Serie A, finishing in the top four each of these times. Fluminense&#x27;s first title of the 21st century was the 2002 Campeonato Carioca. In 2005, Fluminense won the Campeonato Caroica and the Taca Rio, and finished fifth in the Brasileirao. Later that year, they reached the final of the Copa do Brasil again, but lost to Serie B club Paulista 2–0, marking one of the few times that a Serie B club won the Copa do Brasil.

In 2007, Fluminense won the Copa do Brasil beating Figueirense in the final, and was admitted to the Copa Libertadores again after 23 years. In the 2007 Serie A, the club finished fourth, and Thiago Neves won the Golden Ball for the league&#x27;s best player.

The club&#x27;s 2008 Copa Libertadores campaign saw them reach the finals and included a remarkable 6–0 victory against Arsenal de Sarandí in the group stage, winning both games against Colombian club Atlético Nacional in R16, a comeback against São Paulo in the QF, and disposing of defending champions Boca Juniors in the SF with a 3–1 victory. Fluminense eventually finished runner-up, losing the finals to LDU Quito on penalties after a 5–5 draw on aggregate, despite a hat-trick from Thiago Neves in the second leg. Fluminense had already faced LDU in the group stage, winning 1-0 and drawing 0-0. The club finished fourteenth in the Serie A that season, and only finished one point away from relegation, but curiously still qualifying for the following years Copa Sudamericana.

After signing 27 players and going through 5 different managers in 2009, Fluminense found themselves struggling to avoid another relegation from Série A. With less than one-third of the championship left, the mathematical probability of the club&#x27;s relegation was 98%. At this point, manager Cuca decided to dispense with some of the more experienced players and gave Fluminense&#x27;s youngsters a chance. That, along with Fred&#x27;s recovery from a serious injury and substantial support from the fans, allowed not only a sensational escape from relegation with five matches remaining, but also placed Fluminense in the Copa Sudamericana finals, having eliminated rivals Flamengo. For the second year in a row, the club contested a continental cup. In a repeat of the previous year&#x27;s Copa Libertadores, Fluminense lost the finals to LDU Quito.

=== 2010s: Two Brazilian championships ===
For 2010, Muricy Ramalho replaced Cuca. His first task was in the 2010 Copa do Brasil quarter-finals against Grêmio, where Flumiense were eliminated 5–3 on aggregate. However, this elimination was not considered a &quot;failure&quot;, in part because with this elimination the club was not participating in any other competitions and could fully focus on the Brasileirao. Eventually, the elimination helped the club, and that year, with Ramalho&#x27;s effective defensive block conceding the least amount of goals in the league, Fluminense won the Brazilian championship for the third time in their history after 26 years, securing it with a 1–0 victory at home to already relegated Guarani. It was also the fourth title for coach Ramalho in a decade: Ramalho had won the title three times in a row with São Paulo from 2006 to 2008. Darío Conca was named the Brazilian Championship&#x27;s Player of the Season, playing all 38 league matches, while Fred, Washington, and Deco were decisive players in Fluminense&#x27;s title-winning campaign.

For the 2011 season, Fluminense appointed Abel Braga, who led the team to a third-placed finish in the Serie A and qualification for the following year&#x27;s Copa Libertadores, despite being eliminated in the round of 16 of the aforementioned competition by Club Libertad. The club decided to keep Abel Braga for 2012 and made big investments for the squad, bringing back Thiago Neves and signing youngster Wellington Nem. On 13 May 2012, Fluminense won the Campeonato Carioca, beating Rio rivals Botafogo 5–1 on aggregate for their first title of the 2012 season. In the Copa Libertadores, Fluminense was eliminated in the quarter-finals by powerhouse Boca Juniors, losing 2–1 on aggregate. Later that year, on 11 November, they won their fourth Brazilian championship after defeating near-relegated Palmeiras 3–2, with three matchdays left. Striker Fred was also the competition&#x27;s top scorer, with 20 goals, and received the CBF Best Player award. Goalkeeper Diego Cavalieri had a phenomenal season and won the Bola de Prata as the league&#x27;s best goalkeeper, and Abel Braga was chosen as best coach.

==== 2013: Close call ====
In 2013, Fluminense was eliminated in the Copa Libertadores quarter-finals again, this time to Olimpia. In the Série A, things took a turn for the worse when they lost six of their first nine matches, leading to the sacking of Abel Braga. Seven undefeated matches in September steered the club away from relegation, but an eight-match winless run put the club back into the fight for relegation, mainly due to the absences of stars Deco, Fred, Thiago Neves, Carlinhos and Wellington Nem, and in December 2013, a 2–1 victory away to Bahia in the last round of the Série A had Fluminense mathematically relegated to Série B. However, Portuguesa and Fluminense&#x27;s main rivals Flamengo fielded ineligible players in their matches against Grêmio and Cruzeiro respectively, thus losing 4 points after a verdict by STJD (Brazil&#x27;s governing football jury). The points lost by Flamengo and Portuguesa allowed Fluminense to stay in Série A, with Portuguesa being relegated and Flamengo ending the championship as the lowest-ranked non-relegated club.

==== Since 2014: Rebuild ====
In 2014, Fluminense brought back Darío Conca, as well as Walter and Cícero. Coupled with Fred&#x27;s and Carlinhos’ recoveries from injury, Fluminense spent the majority of the 2014 Série A in the top five and fighting for one of the berths at the 2015 Copa Libertadores, ultimately failing to reach its goal after an unstable final stretch and finishing 6th. In December, Fluminense ended its partnership with its main sponsor, Unimed. For fifteen years, the health insurance company was the main investor in signing players, especially after the team won the 2007 Copa do Brasil, bringing to the club athletes such as Darío Conca, Deco, Diego Cavalieri, Fred, Rafael Sóbis, Thiago Neves and Washington. From 2015 onwards, Fluminense underwent a remodeling, with the departure of some of its main players. The club&#x27;s youth categories became fundamental for its maintenance in the first division in the following years, and the sale of young players became the club&#x27;s main source of income.

In 2019, Fluminense hired Fernando Diniz, a young coach with innovative ideas within Brazilian football, but political conflicts within the club forced him out. The following year, the club brought back Fred, one of the greatest idols in the club&#x27;s history, and in the 2020 season qualified for the Copa Libertadores under Odair Hellmann&#x27;s tutelage.

=== 2020s: Copa Libertadores title and FIFA Club World Cup finalist ===
The team returns to compete in the Copa Libertadores after eight years out of the competition, and with consistent campaigns in the Brazilian championship it manages to secure places in the competitions in consecutive editions of the Libertadores. However, after Odair&#x27;s departure, the club has difficulty maintaining a coach, with Marcão, Roger Machado and Abel Braga taking over the position. In 2022, after winning the Campeonato Carioca against rivals Flu, their first trophy in a decade, with Argentine striker Germán Cano being the star of the team, and being eliminated from the Libertadores, Abel Braga retires from his coaching career, and Fluminense decides to give Fernando Diniz another chance.

In 2022, Fluminense achieves its best place in the Brazilian Championship in the last ten years, a third place, with an offensive team that is noted for its fluidity and ball possession, and the team qualifies for the group stage of the 2023 Copa Libertadores. In the beginning of the season, the football played by the team is considered by many to be the best in South America, and the team reaches the Campeonato Carioca finals against Flamengo; in the first match the red-black team wins 2–0, but in the second game Fluminense achieved a 4–1 victory, winning the Campeonato Carioca for a second year in a row against its main rival, and Diniz clinching his first trophy with the club. 
In the 2023 Libertadores, Fluminense falls into group D, along with River Plate (Argentina), The Strongest (Bolivia) and Sporting Cristal (Peru), despite being considered one of the most difficult groups in the edition, Fluminense ranks first, inflicting the biggest defeat in River Plate&#x27;s history in the competition, 5–1 at Maracanã. In the final stage of the dispute, the opponents were Argentinos Juniors, Olimpia (Paraguay) and Internacional, the team defeated all opponents without suffering any defeat.

The Maracanã was previously chosen to be the stage for the final; on the other side the opponent would be Boca Juniors, who sought to become champions of the competition for the seventh time, and with this become the greatest champion of the competition, tied to Independiente. In the final, striker Germán Cano opened the scoring for Fluminense, but Peruvian right-back Luis Advíncula tied the match for Boca; the match then went into extra time, when youngster John Kennedy, coming from the youth team, came off the bench and scored the team&#x27;s second goal. The match ended 2–1 for Fluminense, who lifted the Copa Libertadores trophy for the first time. The Copa Libertadores win sent Fluminense to play in the FIFA Club World Cup semi final, where they beat African champions Al Ahly from Egypt 2-0, but lost 4-0 in the final against Manchester City.

==Rivalries==
According to the fluzao.info site, the average paying public at the principal &quot;classicos&quot; of Fluminense played in the Estádio do Maracanã is 60,107 against Flamengo, 43,735 against Vasco da Gama, 34,359 against Botafogo, 25,127 against America and 22,527 against Bangu (1950-2010). These statistics could be about 20% higher, given the issues of the distribution of gratuities at Maracanã.

=== Grandpa Derby ===
Grandpa Derby or Grandfather Derby (&quot;Clássico Vovô&quot;), played with Botafogo. The name comes from being the two oldest practicing football clubs among the great clubs of Rio de Janeiro, and this is also the oldest derby in Brazil, because its first game was on 22 October 1905, friendly that Fluminense won by 6–0. Along with six other clubs, they were responsible for creating the Carioca Football Championship in 1906.

=== Fla-Flu ===
Fla-Flu Derby, also called Derby of Crowds (&quot;Clássico das Multidões&quot;), played with Flamengo. It is considered by football experts and much of the sports media as one of the greatest classics in the world. According to writer Nelson Rodrigues, the derby was engendered by resentment. On the tricolor side, the fact that their starting players deserted and went to form Flamengo&#x27;s football department, and on the red-black side, the fact that Fluminense still won the first match, circumstances that have been fundamental in generating the derby&#x27;s mystique.

=== Giants&#x27; Derby ===
Giants&#x27; Derby (&quot;Clássico dos Gigantes&quot;), played with Vasco da Gama. The derby gets its name because of the &quot;giant&quot; matches that have been played between the two, these being the final for the 1984 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, which was won by Fluminense, and the 1985 Copa Libertadores, which had two draws, in addition to several decisions Carioca Championship: 1949, 1956, 1970, 1972, 1975, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1993, 1994 and 2003.

=== Silvio Santos Derby ===
Silvio Santos Derby (&quot;Clássico Silvio Santos&quot;), played with Corinthians. It is perhaps the most representative among the various interstate confrontations with big Brazilian clubs played by Fluminense, given the fact that these clubs often intersect at decisive moments in their seasons. The Derby dates back to 1933, in a friendly match that marked both Fluminense&#x27;s first match as a professional team and Corinthians&#x27; first inter-state match as a professional.

The fixture&#x27;s name was given on 17 August 2024, after the Brazilian television host of the same name, died on the same day. Santos was a supporter of both clubs.

== Stadiums ==
=== Laranjeiras Stadium ===
The Manoel Schwartz Stadium is better known as the Laranjeiras Stadium, or also the Álvaro Chaves Street Stadium, due to the name of the street where its main entrance is located. It was the place where the Rio team played its games for decades, however, for security reasons, due to the high demand for attendance at its games, it no longer does so, currently playing at Maracanã.

Flu&#x27;s first match at the Laranjeiras Stadium was the 4–1 victory over Vila Isabel, in the 1919 Carioca Championship, with the Tricolor goals having been scored by Harry Welfare (3) and Machado. Opened in 1919 with a capacity for 18,000 people and having had its capacity expanded to 25,000 people since 1922, in some games this stadium had estimated audiences greater than its capacity.

The record for paying audiences was in the Fluminense 3-1 Flamengo match, on 14 June 1925, when 25,718 spectators paid for tickets, although today the audience for Fluminense&#x27;s match against Sporting, held on 15 July, is unknown. 1928, in the Vulcain Cup dispute, with the stadium full and over 2,000 chairs being placed on the athletics track to accommodate the public present.

Currently, Fluminense does not play its games at its stadium, at the club&#x27;s option, as it would no longer have the security conditions and capacity to host large events, and is currently only used for training, small commemorative events, social and educational projects, games of the women&#x27;s football team and the youth teams. The last time an official match for Fluminense&#x27;s main team took place at Laranjeiras Stadium was in 2003, where Flu drew 3–3 with Americano, in the Carioca Championship.

The renovation of the stadium has been a long-standing demand of the club, however a series of problems make this difficult, such as technical issues linked to the historical preservation of the building, the small area for the construction of a modern stadium and the opposition of the surrounding residents. The current project, at a more advanced stage, foresees a revitalization of Laranjeiras, with the stadium remaining with a small audience capacity, being able to host lower demand games, such as the first phases of the state championship and women&#x27;s football.

=== Maracanã Stadium ===
Since its construction for the 1950 World Cup, the Maracanã has primarily served as the home ground for the four biggest Rio de Janeiro clubs. The stadium was officially completed in 1965, 17 years after construction began. In 1963, more than 194,000 people attended a match between Flamengo and Fluminense at the Maracanã, Rio Championship final.

At the stadium, Fluminense won some of the most important titles, such as the 1952 Copa Rio, for many the most important in its history, it won its first Brazilian Championship in 1970, the &quot;Tricolor Machine&quot; was twice champion of Carioca (1975–76), led by Roberto Rivellino, it was Brazilian champion over its rival Vasco da Gama, in 1984, was three-time Rio champion against Flamengo (1983–85), he was Carioca champion in 1995 with Renato Gaúcho&#x27;s belly goal, against Romário&#x27;s Flamengo (at the time named FIFA World Player of the Year). In this century he won the 2007 Brazil&#x27;s Cup and the 2023 Copa Libertadores.

Following its 50th anniversary and aiming to hold the 2000 FIFA Club World Cup in Brazil, the stadium underwent renovations which would increase its full capacity to around 103,000. After years of planning and nine months of closure between 2005 and 2006, the stadium was reopened in January 2007 with an all-seated capacity of 87,000. For the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, a major expedition project was started in 2010. The original stand, with a two-level configuration, was demolished, making way for a new single-level stand, and the stadium had its capacity reduced to 78,838 seats.

From 2013 onwards, the stadium was managed by the Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht. Corruption scandals, the high rents charged by the company and the abandonment of the stadium, meant that Flamengo and Fluminense came together to manage it. Although clubs have kept the stadium in good condition since 2016 and covered its maintenance costs, it was only in 2019 that the government canceled contracts with Odebrecht. Flamengo and Fluminense then created a joint company, &quot;Fla-Flu S.A.&quot; opened especially to manage Maracanã and its entire sports complex.

<text>Antennae (: antenna) (sometimes referred to as &quot;feelers&quot;) are paired appendages used for sensing in arthropods.

Antennae are connected to the first one or two segments of the arthropod head. They vary widely in form but are always made of one or more jointed segments. While they are typically sensory organs, the exact nature of what they sense and how they sense it is not the same in all groups. Functions may variously include sensing touch, air motion, heat, vibration (sound), and especially smell or taste. Antennae are sometimes modified for other purposes, such as mating, brooding, swimming, and even anchoring the arthropod to a substrate. Larval arthropods have antennae that differ from those of the adult. Many crustaceans, for example, have free-swimming larvae that use their antennae for swimming. Antennae can also locate other group members if the insect lives in a group, like the ant. 
The common ancestor of all arthropods likely had one pair of uniramous (unbranched) antenna-like structures, followed by one or more pairs of biramous (having two major branches) leg-like structures, as seen in some modern crustaceans and fossil trilobites. Except for the chelicerates and proturans, which have none, all non-crustacean arthropods have a single pair of antennae.

==Crustaceans==

Crustaceans bear two pairs of antennae. The pair attached to the first segment of the head are called primary antennae or antennules. This pair is generally uniramous, but is biramous in crabs and lobsters and remipedes. The pair attached to the second segment are called secondary antennae or simply antennae. The second antennae are plesiomorphically biramous, but many species later evolved uniramous pairs. The second antennae may be significantly reduced (e.g. remipedes) or apparently absent (e.g. barnacles).

The subdivisions of crustacean antennae have many names, including flagellomeres (a shared term with insects), annuli, articles, and segments. The terminal ends of crustacean antennae have two major categorizations: segmented and flagellate. An antenna is considered segmented if each of the annuli is separate from those around it and has individual muscle attachments. Flagellate antennae, on the other hand, have muscle attachments only around the base, acting as a hinge for the flagellum—a flexible string of annuli with no muscle attachment.

There are several notable non-sensory uses of antennae in crustaceans. Many crustaceans have a mobile larval stage called a nauplius, which is characterized by its use of antennae for swimming. Barnacles, a highly modified crustacean, use their antennae to attach to rocks and other surfaces. The second antennae in the burrowing Hippoidea and Corystidae have setae that interlock to form a tube or &quot;snorkel&quot; which funnels filtered water over the gills.

==Insects==

Some claim insects evolved from prehistoric crustaceans, and they have secondary antennae like crustaceans, but not primary antennae. Antennae are the primary olfactory sensors of insects and are accordingly well-equipped with a wide variety of sensilla (singular: &quot;sensillum&quot;). Paired, mobile, and segmented, they are located between the eyes on the forehead. Embryologically, they represent the appendages of the second head segment.

All insects have antennae, however they may be greatly reduced in the larval forms. Amongst the non-insect classes of the Hexapoda, both Collembola and Diplura have antenna, but Protura do not.

Antennal fibrillae play an important role in &quot;Culex pipiens&quot; mating practices. The erection of these fibrillae is considered to be the first stage in reproduction. These fibrillae serve different functions across the sexes. As antennal fibrillae are used by female &quot;C. pipiens&quot; to locate hosts to feed on, male &quot;C. pipiens&quot; utilize them to locate female mates.

===Structure===

The three basic segments of the typical insect antenna are the scape or &quot;scapus&quot; (base), the pedicel or &quot;pedicellus&quot; (stem), and finally the flagellum, which often comprises many units known as flagellomeres. The pedicel (the second segment) contains the Johnston&#x27;s organ which is a collection of sensory cells.

The scape is mounted in a socket in a more or less ring-shaped sclerotised region called the torulus, often a raised portion of the insect&#x27;s head capsule. The socket is closed off by the membrane into which the base of the scape is set. However, the antenna does not hang free on the membrane, but pivots on a rigidly sprung projection from the rim of the torulus. That projection on which the antenna pivots is called the antennifer. The whole structure enables the insect to move the antenna as a whole by applying internal muscles connected to the scape. The pedicel is flexibly connected to the distal end of the scape and its movements in turn can be controlled by muscular connections between the scape and pedicel. The number of flagellomeres can vary greatly between insect species, and often is of diagnostic importance.

True flagellomeres are connected by membranous linkage that permits movement, though the flagellum of &quot;true&quot; insects does not have any intrinsic muscles. Some other Arthropoda do however have intrinsic muscles throughout the flagellum. Such groups include the Symphyla, Collembola and Diplura. In many true insects, especially the more primitive groups such as Thysanura and Blattodea, the flagellum partly or entirely consists of a flexibly connected string of small ring-shaped annuli. The annuli are not true flagellomeres, and in a given insect species the number of annuli generally is not as consistent as the number of flagellomeres in most species.

In many beetles and in the chalcidoid wasps, the apical flagellomeres form a club shape, called the clava. The collective term for the segments between the club and the antennal base is the funicle; traditionally in describing beetle anatomy, the term &quot;funicle&quot; refers to the segments between the club and the scape. However, traditionally in working on wasps the funicle is taken to comprise the segments between the club and the pedicel.

Quite commonly the funicle beyond the pedicel is quite complex in Endopterygota such as beetles, moths and Hymenoptera, and one common adaptation is the ability to fold the antenna in the middle, at the joint between the pedicel and the flagellum. This gives an effect like a &quot;knee bend&quot;, and such an antenna is said to be geniculate. Geniculate antennae are common in the Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. They are important for insects like ants that follow scent trails, for bees and wasps that need to &quot;sniff&quot; the flowers that they visit, and for beetles such as Scarabaeidae and Curculionidae that need to fold their antennae away when they self-protectively fold up all their limbs in defensive attitudes.

Because the funicle is without intrinsic muscles, it generally must move as a unit, in spite of being articulated. However, some funicles are complex and very mobile. For example, the Scarabaeidae have lamellate antennae that can be folded tightly for safety or spread openly for detecting odours or pheromones. The insect manages such actions by changes in blood pressure, by which it exploits elasticity in walls and membranes in the funicles, which are in effect erectile.

In the groups with more uniform antennae (for example: millipedes), all segments are called &quot;antennomeres&quot;. Some groups have a simple or variously modified apical or subapical bristle called an arista (this may be especially well-developed in various Diptera).

===Functions===

Olfactory receptors on the antennae bind to free-floating molecules, such as water vapour, and odours including pheromones. The neurons that possess these receptors signal this binding by sending action potentials down their axons to the antennal lobe in the brain. From there, neurons in the antennal lobes connect to mushroom bodies that identify the odour. The sum of the electrical potentials of the antennae to a given odour can be measured using an electroantennogram.

In the monarch butterfly, antennae are necessary for proper time-compensated solar compass orientation during migration. Antennal clocks exist in monarchs, and they are likely to provide the primary timing mechanism for sun compass orientation.

In the African cotton leafworm, antennae have an important function in signaling courtship. Specifically, antennae are required for males to answer the female mating call. Although females do not require antennae for mating, a mating that resulted from a female without antennae was abnormal.

In the diamondback moth, antennae serve to gather information about a host plant&#x27;s taste and odor. After the desired taste and odor has been identified, the female moth will deposit her eggs onto the plant. Giant swallowtail butterflies also rely on antenna sensitivity to volatile compounds to identify host plants. It was found that females are actually more responsive with their antenna sensing, most likely because they are responsible for oviposition on the correct plant.

In the crepuscular hawk moth (&quot;Manduca sexta&quot;), antennae aid in flight stabilization. Similar to halteres in Dipteran insects, the antennae transmit coriolis forces through the Johnston&#x27;s organ that can then be used for corrective behavior. A series of low-light, flight stability studies in which moths with flagellae amputated near the pedicel showed significantly decreased flight stability over those with intact antennae. To determine whether there may be other antennal sensory inputs, a second group of moths had their antennae amputated and then re-attached, before being tested in the same stability study. These moths showed slightly decreased performance from intact moths, indicating there are possibly other sensory inputs used in flight stabilization. Re-amputation of the antennae caused a drastic decrease in flight stability to match that of the first amputated group.
