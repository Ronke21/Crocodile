<text>Bareilly (; ) is a city in Bareilly district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is among the largest metropolises in Western Uttar Pradesh and is the centre of the Bareilly division as well as the historical region of Rohilkhand. The city lies in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, about northwest of the state capital, Lucknow, and east of the national capital, New Delhi. With a population of 903,668 in 2011, it is the eighth most populous city in the state, 17th in northern India and 54th in India. It is located on the bank of Ramganga River and is the site of the Ramganga Barrage built for canal irrigation.

The earliest settlement in what is now Bareilly was established in 1537 by a local chieftain Jagat Singh Katehriya who named it &#x27;Bans-Bareli&#x27; after his two sons Bansaldev and Bareldev. The town came under the rule of the Mughals in 1569 and had become the capital of a local pargana by 1596. The foundation of the modern city of Bareilly was laid by Mughal governor Mukrand Rai in 1657, and in 1658 it became the seat of the governor of Budaun. The weakening of Mughal Empire lead to the rise of the Kingdom of Rohilkhand, of which Bareilly was a major centre. The city came under the control of Oudh State in 1774 after the fall of Rohillas in the First Rohilla War and was then ceded to the British East India Company by the Nawab of Oudh in 1801. A Military station was established in 1811 to the south of the city, where a fort was constructed in 1816. Bareilly was freed by the rebels during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and remained independent under the rule of Khan Bahadur Khan until it was re-annexed by the British in 1858.

Bareilly is renowned for being the place of origin of the Barelvi Movement, a Sunni Islamic movement formed by notable scholar Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Qadri to counter the growing influence of Wahabism. His shrine, located at the Bareilly Sharif Dargah, is visited by millions every year on the occasion of Urs-e-Razavi.

The city has been known as &quot;Nath Nagri&quot; due to the presence of several ancient Shiva temples, and more recently as &quot;Jumka City&quot;. It is a centre for furniture manufacturing and trade in cotton, cereal and sugar. Bareilly is one of the 100 Smart Cities being developed in India, and is one of the nine counter magnet cities of the National Capital Region (NCR). The city is served by the Bareilly Airport which has direct flight connectivity with Delhi, Lucknow, Mumbai and Bangalore. The Bareilly Junction railway station, located in the city is among the Top 100 booking stations of Indian Railways while Izzatnagar is the divisional headquarters of one of the three divisions of North Eastern Railways.

==History==
According to the epic Mahābhārata, the Bareilly region (Panchala) is said to be the birthplace of Draupadi, who was also referred to as &#x27;Panchali&#x27; (one from the kingdom of Panchāla) by Kṛṣṇā (Lord Krishna). When Yudhishthira becomes the king of Hastinapur at the end of the Mahābhārata, Draupadi becomes his queen. The folklore says that Gautama Buddha had once visited the ancient fortress city of Ahichchhatra in Bareilly. The Jain Tirthankara Parshva is said to have attained Kaivalya at Ahichchhatra.

In the 12th century, the kingdom was under the rule by different clans of Kshatriya Rajputs. Then the region became part of the Muslim Turkic Delhi Sultanate for 325 years before getting absorbed in the emerging Mughal Empire. The foundation of the modern City of Bareilly foundation was laid by Mughal governor Mukrand Rai in 1657 during the rule of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Later the region became the capital of Rohilkhand region before getting handed over to Nawab Vazir of Awadh and then to East India Company (transferred to the British India) and later becoming an integral part of India. The region has, also, acted as a mint for a major part of its history.

From archaeological point of view the district of Bareilly is very rich. The extensive remains of Ahichchhatra, the Capital town of Northern Panchala have been discovered near Ramnagar village of Aonla Tehsil in the district. It was during the first excavations at Ahichchhatra (1940–44) that the painted grey ware, associated with the advent of the Aryans in the Ganges–Yamuna Valley, was recognised for the first time in the earliest levels of the site. Nearly five thousand coins belonging to periods earlier than that of Guptas have been yielded from Ahichchhatra. It has also been one of the richest sites in India from the point of view of the total yield of terracotta. Some of the masterpieces of Indian terracotta art are from Ahichchhatra. In fact the classification made of the terracotta human figurines from Ahichchhatra on grounds of style and to some extent stratigraphy became a model for determining the stratigraphy of subsequent excavations at other sites in the Ganges Valley. On the basis of the existing material, the archaeology of the region helps us to get an idea of the cultural sequence from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC up to the 11th century AD. Some ancient mounds in the district have also been discovered by the Deptt. of Ancient History and culture, Rohilkhand University, at Tihar-Khera (Fatehganj West), Pachaumi, Rahtuia, Kadarganj and Sainthal. Apart from this, artefacts of painted grey ware culture of the Iron Age have also been discovered near the city.

===Establishment ===

Bareilly was founded in 1537 by Jagat Singh Katehriya, a Rajput who named it &quot;Bareilly &quot; after his two sons Bansaldev and Baraldev. The city was mentioned by the historian Budayuni. The foundation of the modern city of Bareilly was laid by Mughal governor Mukrand Rai in 1657. In 1658, Bareilly became the headquarters of the province of Budaun. The Mughals encouraged the settlements of loyal Afghans (Pathans) in the Bareilly region to control the rebellious Katehriya Rajputs. After the death of Emperor 
Aurangzeb, the Afghans began to settle in the villages and assimilated with the local Muslims. These descendants of these assimilated Afghans are known as Pathans. After the fall of the Mughal Empire, created anarchy and many Pathans migrated from the Rohilkhand region. Bareilly (like other cities in Uttar Pradesh) experienced economic stagnation and poverty due to the breakdown of trade and security, leading to the migration of Rohilla Muslim Pathans to Suriname and Guyana as indentured labour.

===British East India Company===
Under Barech at the 1761 Third Battle of Panipat, Rohilkhand blocked the expansion of the Maratha Empire into northern India. In 1772 it was invaded by the Marathas, repulsing the invasion with the aid of the Nawab of Awadh. After the war, Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula demanded payment for the nawabs&#x27; help from Barech. When his demand was refused, the nawab joined the East India Company (under Governor Warren Hastings and his Commander-in-Chief, Alexander Champion) to invade Rohilkhand. The combined forces of Daula and the Company defeated Barech (who was killed in battle at Miranpur Katra, ending Rohilla rule) in 1774. Rohilkhand was handed over to Daula, and from 1774 to 1800 the province was ruled by the Nawab of Awadh who surrendered Rohilkhand to the East India Company in a treaty signed on 10 November 1801.
 During the reign of Shah Alam II, Bareilly was the headquarters of Rohilla Sardar Hafiz Rehmat Khan and many coins were minted. The city was later in the possession of Awadh Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah, and his coins had Bareilly, Bareilly Aasfabad and the Bareilly kite and fish as identification marks. Coins were then minted by the East India Company.

===Modern period===

After the Rohilla War, the change in the power structure increased discontent throughout the district.

The most popular trades in and around Bareilly during the 1820s were manufacturing glass, jewellery, glass and lac bangles and gold and silver thread, crimping, bean drying, wire drawing, charpoy weaving, keeping a grocer&#x27;s shop and selling kebabs.

====Rebellion of 1857 ====
Bareilly was a centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The rebellion began as a mutiny of Indian soldiers (sepoys), employed in the three Presidency armies, against race- and religion-based injustices and inequities on 10 May 1857 in Meerut. It expanded into other mutinies and civilian rebellions, primarily in the major north-central Indian river valleys; local episodes extended northwest to Peshawar (on the northwest frontier with Afghanistan) and southeast (beyond Delhi). There were riots in many parts of Uttar Pradesh, and Muslims in Bareilly, Bijnor and Moradabad called for the revival of a Muslim kingdom.

The Rohillas actively opposed the British, but were later disarmed. Khan Bahadur Khan Rohilla, grandson of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, formed his own government in Bareilly in 1857 and a widespread popular revolt in Awadh, Bundelkhand and Rohilkhand took place. In 1857, Khan Bhadur Khan issued silver coins from Bareilly as an independent ruler. When the rebellion failed, Bareilly was subjugated. Khan Bahadur Khan was sentenced to death, and hanged in the police station on 24 February 1860.

===Independence ===
Bareilly Central Jail housed a number of political prisoners who supported the independence movement including Yashpal (who married while imprisoned on 7 August 1936 was the first such ceremony in an Indian jail). The rules were changed, preventing future prison marriages.

The city is equidistant from New Delhi (national capital) and Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. This makes Bareilly a nodal point between two major cities of India.

Bareilly was a flourishing cotton centre in early nineteenth century. There were about 20,000 looms in the city in 1802, with a production value of Rs 30,00,000 per year.

Ganj, located at a distance of 8 km from the city center. HR Sugar Factory was established in Nekpur in 1932. As a result, Bareilly emerged as a major industrial and commercial area of the region by the 1940s, with many banks and educational institutions being established in every corner of the city.

The industrial development of the city continued after the independence of India in 1947 and small scale industries related to &quot;khandsari&quot;, furniture, engineering and oil extraction began to take shape in Shahamatganj and Nai Basti.

The Indian Turpentine &amp; Rosin Factory (ITR) was shut down in April 1998 and the sugar mill of Nekpur ceased production in September 1998. The mill, which was under the control of the UP Sugar Corporation had been awarded a gold medal for producing sugar more than the set target in the year 1997 itself. A rubber factory situated in Fatehganj West was also closed on 15 July 1999. The products of the factory were famous all over Asia, and about two thousand people were serving in this factory. The WIMCO factory in CB Ganj, which used to supply matches across the country, was shut down in 2015. Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative (IFFCO) has a large plant at Aonla (30 km).

The Bareilly bus station (old bus stand) located in Civil Lines caters to Buses plying on routes towards the north, west and south of city i.e. on Moradabad-Delhi, Haldwani-Nainital, Haridwar-Dehradun and Agra-Jaipur routes; while the Bareilly Satellite bus station caters to bus services eastwards of the city notably to Kanpur, Lucknow, Prayagraj and Tanakpur. Another bus station is proposed at Izzatnagar. The bus station would be built over an area of 2.285 hectares and would cater to bus services towards Delhi and Uttarakhand.

=== City Buses ===

City buses in Bareilly are operated by the Bareilly City Transport Services Limited (BCTSL). Electric buses run on three routes in the city. A charging station-cum-depot for these buses is located in the Swale Nagar neighbourhood of the city.

City bus services in Bareilly were started initially on the Kutubkhana-Railway Junction route by the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation. In the 1960s, a total of 4 buses used to ply on the urban routes, and in 1964, 6 new buses were introduced, increasing the number of buses to 10. By 1963–64 the bus services had been expanded from Koharapeer to Bhojipura and Fatehganj. By the late 1970s, six private buses were operating in the city under the control of the UPSRTC, with an average of 5000 daily commuters. However, gradual increase in the traffic on the city roads and the arrival of smaller vehicles resulted in the roadways bus services going into losses, and therefore the bus services were discontinued in the year 1990. At the time of their discontinuation, City buses used to operate from Kutubkhana to Railway Junction, Sadar Cantt, Sainthal, Nawabganj, Faridpur and Fatehganj.

A proposal to restart city bus services in the city was initiated by Bareilly Municipal Corporation in 2019 under the Smart Cities Mission; 25 CNG and Electric buses were proposed to ply on five routes with a depot at Ramganga Nagar. Approval to operate AC Electric buses in the city was granted by state Cabinet in December 2019. Construction of a charging station for the electric buses commenced in Swale Nagar in 2020, and was completed in September 2021. The Electric Buses were inaugurated on 4 January 2022.

===Rail ===

Bareilly Junction lies on Lucknow-Moradabad Line and Lucknow-Sitapur-Lakhimpur-Pilibhit-Bareilly-Kasganj Line. Bareilly has been Connected to the rest of India by rail since the 19th century, and a 1909 map shows that Bareilly was a railway junction during the early 20th century. Six rail lines intersect in the city. After the British Indian Government purchased the Indian Branch Railway on 31 March 1872, and renamed the Lucknow–Kanpur main line as the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, railway services started to expand towards the west of Lucknow. The construction of a railway line from Lucknow to Sandila and then further onwards to Hardoi was completed in 1872. This line was further extended to Bareilly on 1 November 1873. Prior to that, another railway line connecting Moradabad to Chandausi had already been built in 1872; it too was extended to Bareilly, the construction completed on 22 December 1873.

A new railway line connecting Bareilly and Moradabad via Rampur, called the Bareilly–Moradabad Chord, was approved on 4 December 1891, and was completed by 8 June 1894. On 8 December 1894, the main line was officially diverted to this chord, while the older line was renamed the Chandausi loop. In 1890 the Bengal and North Western Railway leased the Tirhoot State Railway to increase the latter&#x27;s revenue, and the Lucknow-Sitapur-Seramow Provincial State Railway merged with the Bareilly-Pilibheet Provincial State Railway to form the Lucknow-Bareilly Railway on 1 January 1891. The Lucknow-Bareilly Railway was owned by the Government of India, and operated by the Rohilkund and Kumaon Railway.

The Oudh and Tirhut Railway was formed on 1 January 1943 by the merger of the Bengal and North Western Railway, the Tirhut Railway (BNW operated), the Mashrak-Thawe Extension Railway (BNW operated), the Rohilkund and Kumaon Railway and the Lucknow-Bareilly Railway (R&amp;K operated). The Oudh and Tirhut Railway was later renamed the Oudh Tirhut Railway; it merged with the Assam Railway and the Kanpur-Achnera section of the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway to form North Eastern Railway (headquartered in Gorakhpur, with a divisional headquarters in Izzatnagar), one of the 16 zones of the Indian Railways.

The AAI began the tender process to award construction contracts for the airport in September 2017 and expected the civil enclave to be ready by March 2018, pending Uttar Pradesh government approval. However, the IAF requested changes in the layout of the taxiway connecting the terminal to the runway. After the Ministry of Defence approved the taxiway, passenger service was hoped to begin by February 2019.

<text>Arnold Beichman (May 17, 1913February 17, 2010) was an author, scholar, and a critic of communism. At the time of his death, he was a Hoover Institution research fellow and a columnist for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Beichman was born on New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side, in Manhattan, in a family of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. He received a B.A. from Columbia University in 1934, after which he succeeded his friend, Arthur Lelyveld, as editor-in-chief of the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;.

Beichman spent many years in journalism, working for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;PM&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and others. He returned to Columbia in his 50s to receive his M.A. and Ph.D. in political science, in 1967 and 1973, respectively.

He gave his name to &quot;Beichman&#x27;s Law,&quot; which states: &quot;With the single exception of the American Revolution, the aftermath of all revolutions from 1789 on only worsened the human condition.&quot;
His Jewish father Solomon Beichman was unhappy, because he wanted Arnold to be a rabbi.
The Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars was in part funded by Beichman&#x27;s donations.

<doc id="1001843" wikidata="Q2604671" url="?curid=1001843" title="Aliou Cissé">
<text>Aliou Cissé (born 24 March 1976) is a Senegalese professional football coach and former player who was the recent manager of the Senegal national team. Cissé is best known for captaining the Senegal team which reached the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations Final and for being the first Senegal manager to win the tournament in 2022 after reaching the final in 2019.

Having begun his career in France, he later played for English clubs Birmingham City and Portsmouth. Cissé was a defensive midfielder who also, on occasion, played at centre-back.

Cissé has been the head coach of Senegal since 2015, having briefly taken charge of them following Amara Traoré&#x27;s sacking, in a caretaker role in 2012. He was also the assistant coach of the under-23 side from 2012 to 2013, becoming head coach from 2013 to 2015.

==Club career==
Born in Ziguinchor, Senegal, Cissé moved to Paris at the age of nine, where he grew up with dreams of playing for Paris Saint-Germain. He began his career with Lille before moving onto Sedan and then Paris Saint-Germain. He also spent the majority of the 2001–02 season on loan at Montpellier.

After captaining the Senegal national team to the quarter-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Cissé transferred to English club Birmingham City for their 2002–03 season, their debut season in the Premier League. Cissé made his first appearance for the club at Arsenal on the opening day of the season, but was sent off. Though the sending-off was rescinded, he went on to receive five yellow cards in six games, ultimately accumulating ten yellow cards before the New Year. His season, however, was cut short after picking up an injury in February that ruled him out for the rest of the season.

Cissé returned late to pre-season training in July 2003, which led manager Steve Bruce to place him on the transfer list. Cissé eventually got himself back into the first team picture, but his relationship with Bruce continued to sour. After Christmas, Cissé only played three more games that season. At the end of the season, he signed for Portsmouth for £300,000 on a two-year contract, despite a strong transfer link to Premiership rivals Bolton Wanderers. The transfer was ultimately one of several included in the Stevens report released in June 2007, which expressed concerns of corruption within English football. Regarding Cissé, the report stated: &quot;Agent Willie McKay acted for Portsmouth in the transfer of Cissé and [...] the inquiry is not prepared to clear these transfers at this stage&quot;.

After two years at Portsmouth, Cissé returned to Sedan in November 2006, after undergoing a two-week trial. He then signed for French Ligue 2 side Nîmes from Sedan in September 2008. Cissé played seven games during the 2008–09 season, before retiring from club football at the age of 33.

==International career==
Cissé captained the Senegal national team at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. After a 1–0 victory over reigning world champions France on matchday one, the team made it all the way to the quarter-finals where they lost 1–0 to Turkey. Cissé was also part of the Senegal team who were the runners-up in the 2002 African Cup of Nations, but was one of the players who missed a penalty during the shootout in the final as they lost to Cameroon.

==Managerial career==

In early March 2015, Cissé was officially appointed as the head coach for the Senegal national team. The team qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup on 10 November 2017, with a 2–0 away win against South Africa. Ultimately, Senegal were knocked out in the group stage of the tournament after becoming the first team in FIFA World Cup history to be eliminated due to fair play tiebreaker rules. &quot;This is one of the rules. We have to respect it&quot;, said Cissé. &quot;Of course, we would prefer to be eliminated another way. It&#x27;s a sad day for us but we knew these were the regulations.&quot;

Cissé coached Senegal at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations tournament, helping Senegal to its first final since 2002, a tournament in which Cissé himself had participated as the team&#x27;s captain. However, his Senegal was defeated 1–0 in the final by Algeria, after losing by the same score in the group stage, and missed out on its first ever African trophy.

In February 2019, Senegal&#x27;s Football Federation (FSF) extended Cissé and his staff&#x27;s contracts until August 2021.

On 6 February 2022, Cissé led Senegal to victory at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. In the final they beat Egypt 4–2 on penalties to clinch their first title, thus redeemed himself after two previous final defeats.

In the 2022 FIFA World Cup, he led the Senegalese national team to the knockout stage for the first time since he was a player in 2002.

On 2 October 2024, Aliou Cissé was dismissed from the job as Senegal coach after the team&#x27;s round of 16 exit at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations and their underwhelming performance during the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification.

==Personal life==
Cissé lost several members of his family in the ferry disaster that occurred off the coast of The Gambia on 26 September 2002. To honour the lives lost, Cissé participated in a charity match between Senegal and Nigeria that raised money for the families of the more than 1,000 reported victims. Birmingham City, one of his former clubs, collected money for the victims&#x27; families and honored Cissé by displaying a giant Senegal flag during a game against Manchester City.

<text>Trehalose (from Turkish &quot;tıgala&quot; – a sugar derived from insect cocoons + -ose) is a sugar consisting of two molecules of glucose. It is also known as mycose or tremalose. Some bacteria, fungi, plants and invertebrate animals synthesize it as a source of energy, and to survive freezing and lack of water.

Extracting trehalose was once a difficult and costly process, but around 2000, the Hayashibara company (Okayama, Japan) discovered an inexpensive extraction technology from starch. Trehalose has high water retention capabilities, and is used in food, cosmetics and as a drug. A procedure developed in 2017 using trehalose allows sperm storage at room temperatures.

== Structure ==
Trehalose is a disaccharide formed by a bond between two α-glucose units. It is found in nature as a disaccharide and also as a monomer in some polymers. Two other stereoisomers exist: α,β-trehalose, also called &quot;neotrehalose&quot;, and β,β-trehalose, also called &quot;isotrehalose&quot;. Neither of these alternate isomers has been isolated from living organisms, but isotrehalose has been was found in starch hydroisolates.

==Synthesis==
At least three biological pathways support trehalose biosynthesis. An industrial process can derive trehalose from corn starch.

== Properties ==

=== Chemical ===
Trehalose is a nonreducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1–1 alpha bond, giving it the name . The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore is stable in solution at high temperatures, even under acidic conditions. The bonding keeps nonreducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation). Trehalose is less soluble than sucrose, except at high temperatures (&gt;80 °C). Trehalose forms a rhomboid crystal as the dihydrate, and has 90% of the calorific content of sucrose in that form. Anhydrous forms of trehalose readily regain moisture to form the dihydrate. Anhydrous forms of trehalose can show interesting physical properties when heat-treated.

Trehalose aqueous solutions show a concentration-dependent clustering tendency. Owing to their ability to form hydrogen bonds, they self-associate in water to form clusters of various sizes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that concentrations of 1.5–2.2 molar allow trehalose molecular clusters to percolate and form large and continuous aggregates.

Trehalose directly interacts with nucleic acids, facilitates melting of double stranded DNA and stabilizes single-stranded nucleic acids.

=== Biological ===
Organisms ranging from bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, invertebrates, and lower and higher plants have enzymes that can make trehalose.
In nature, trehalose can be found in plants, and microorganisms. In animals, trehalose is prevalent in shrimp, and also in insects, including grasshoppers, locusts, butterflies, and bees, in which trehalose serves as blood-sugar. Trehalase genes are found in tardigrades, the microscopic ecdysozoans found worldwide in diverse extreme environments.

Trehalose is the major carbohydrate energy storage molecule used by insects for flight. One possible reason for this is that the glycosidic linkage of trehalose, when acted upon by an insect trehalase, releases two molecules of glucose, which is required for the rapid energy requirements of flight. This is double the efficiency of glucose release from the storage polymer starch, for which cleavage of one glycosidic linkage releases only one glucose molecule.

The concentrations of both trehalose and glucose in the insect hemolymph are tightly controlled by multiple enzymes and hormones, including trehalase, insulin-like peptides (ILPs and DILPs), adipokinetic hormone (AKH), leucokinin (LK), octopamine and other mediators, thereby maintaining carbohydrate homeostasis by endocrine and metabolic feedback mechanisms.

In plants, trehalose is seen in sunflower seeds, moonwort, &quot;Selaginella&quot; plants, and sea algae. Within the fungi, it is prevalent in some mushrooms, such as shiitake (&quot;Lentinula edodes&quot;), oyster, king oyster, and golden needle.

Even within the plant kingdom, &quot;Selaginella&quot; (sometimes called the resurrection plant), which grows in desert and mountainous areas, may be cracked and dried out, but will turn green again and revive after rain because of the function of trehalose.

The two prevalent theories as to how trehalose works within the organism in the state of cryptobiosis are the vitrification theory, a state that prevents ice formation, or the water displacement theory, whereby water is replaced by trehalose.

In bacterial cell wall, trehalose has a structural role in adaptive responses to stress such as osmotic differences and extreme temperature. Yeast uses trehalose as a carbon source in response to abiotic stresses. In humans, the only known function of trehalose is as a neuroprotective, which it accomplishes by inducing autophagy and thereby clearing protein aggregates.

Trehalose has also been reported for anti-bacterial, anti-biofilm, and anti-inflammatory (&quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;) activities, upon its esterification with fatty acids of varying chain lengths.

== Nutritional and dietary properties ==
Trehalose is rapidly broken down into glucose by the enzyme trehalase, which is present in the brush border of the intestinal mucosa of omnivores (including humans) and herbivores. It causes less of a spike in blood sugar than glucose. Trehalose has about 45% the sweetness of sucrose at concentrations above 22%, but when the concentration is reduced, its sweetness decreases more quickly than that of sucrose, so that a 2.3% solution tastes 6.5 times less sweet as the equivalent sugar solution.

It is commonly used in prepared frozen foods, like ice cream, because it lowers the freezing point of foods.

Deficiency of trehalase enzyme is unusual in humans, except in the Greenlandic Inuit, where it is present in only 10–15% of the population.

== Metabolism ==
Five biosynthesis pathways have been reported for trehalose. The most common pathway is TPS/TPP pathway which is used by organisms that synthesize trehalose using the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) synthase (TPS). Second, trehalose synthase (TS) in certain types of bacteria could produce trehalose by using maltose and another disaccharide with two glucose units as substrates. Third, the TreY-TreZ pathway in some bacteria converts starch that contain maltooligosaccharide or glycogen directly into trehalose. Fourth, in primitive bacteria, trehalose glycisyltransferring synthase (TreT) produces trehalose from ADP-glucose and glucose. Fifth, trehalose phosphorylase (TreP) either hydrolyses trehalose into glucose-1-phosphate and glucose or may act reversibly in certain species. Vertebrates do not have the ability to synthesize or store trehalose. Trehalase in humans is found only in specific location such as the intestinal mucosa, renal brush-border, liver and blood. Expression of this enzyme in vertebrates is initially found during the gestation period that is the highest after weaning. Then, the level of trehalase remained constant in the intestine throughout life. Meanwhile, diets consisting of plants and fungi contain trehalose. Moderate amount of trehalose in diet is essential and having low amount of trehalose could result in diarrhea, or other intestinal symptoms.

== Medical use ==
Trehalose is an ingredient, along with hyaluronic acid, in an artificial tears product used to treat dry eye. Outbreaks of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; were initially associated with trehalose, but this finding was disputed in 2019.

In 2021, the FDA accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and granted fast track status for an injectable form of trehalose (SLS-005) as a potential treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3).

==History==
In 1832, H.A.L. Wiggers discovered trehalose in an ergot of rye, and in 1859 Marcellin Berthelot isolated it from &quot;Trehala manna&quot;, a substance made by weevils and named it trehalose.

Trehalose has long been known as an autophagy inducer that acts independently of mTOR. In 2017, research was published showing that trehalose induces autophagy by activating TFEB, a protein that acts as a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway.

<text>phpLDAPadmin is a web app for administering Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers. It&#x27;s written in the PHP programming language, and is licensed under the GNU General Public License. The application is available in 14 languages and supports UTF-8 encoded directory strings.

==History==
The project began in Fall of 2002 when Dave Smith, a student from Brigham Young University (BYU) and lead developer, needed a robust web application to manage his LDAP servers. Originally, phpLDAPadmin was called DaveDAP, but in August 2003, the name was changed to phpLDAPadmin. Since that time, the software has been downloaded approximately 150 times per day, and is commonly used throughout the world. Two other developers have contributed to the code base: Xavier Renard and Uwe Ebel. Xavier has focused on LDIF imports/exports and Samba software integration. Uwe has focused on internationalizing the application.

In Spring of 2005, Deon George took over maintenance of phpLDAPadmin.

Due to a long period starting from 2016, where no new pull requests have been merged into the master project, and no further releases were made, several forks exist, that implement new compatibilities and functionality. Since spring 2019 new development is going on and many pull requests were merged into the project restoring compatibility with recent PHP releases.

==Distributions==
The following Linux distributions include phpLDAPadmin in their official software repositories:
* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Gentoo Linux
* Arch Linux

It is available in the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository, allowing managed installation to distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS and Scientific Linux, and is included in the M23 software distribution system, which manages and distributes software for the Debian, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, CentOS and openSUSE distributions.

It is also available in repositories for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris.

<text>Ultras are a type of association football fans who are known for their fanatical support. The term originated in Italy, but is used worldwide to describe predominantly organised fans of association football teams. The behavioural tendency of ultras groups includes singing football chants, playing musical instruments such as drums, their use of flares and smoke bombs (primarily in &quot;tifo&quot; choreography), frequent use of elaborate displays, vocal support in large groups and the displaying of flags and banners at football stadiums, all of which are designed to create an atmosphere which encourages their own team and intimidates the opposing players and their supporters. These groups also commonly organise trips to attend away games.

Ultras groups have been responsible for many cases of football hooliganism and violence, although differently from hooligan firms, ultras do not have the explicit objective of fighting other fans. Ultras groups are also in some cases directly linked to ideologies like neo-Nazism and other forms of far-right politics, and sometimes far-left politics. In some instances, hooliganism and/or this politicisation goes to the point where support for their team is relegated to a secondary feature of the phenomenon.

In recent decades, the culture has become a focal point for the movement against the commercialisation of sports and football in particular. Ultras also have regional variants and analogues, such as casuals in the United Kingdom, &quot;barra bravas&quot; in Hispanic America, and &quot;torcidas organizadas&quot; in Brazil.

==History==
The origin of the ultras movement is disputed, with many supporters groups from various countries making claims solely on the basis of their dates of foundation. The level of dispute and confusion is aided by a contemporary tendency (mainly in Europe) to categorise all groups of overtly fanatical supporters as ultras. Supporters groups of a nature comparable to the ultras have been present in Brazil since 1939, when the first &quot;torcida organizada&quot; was formed (although these groups began to focus on violence in the 1970s). Inspired by the torcidas and the colourful scenes of the 1950 World Cup, supporters of Hajduk Split formed Torcida Split on 28 October 1950. The group is often cited as the oldest torcida style group in Europe. But the first supporters&#x27; groups in the world formed to produce violence were &quot;barras bravas&quot;, originated in Argentina in the 1950s.
One country closely associated with the ultras movement is Italy. The first Italian ultras groups were formed in 1951, including the Fedelissimi Granata of Torino. The 1960s saw the continuing spread and development of the culture with the formation of the Fossa dei Leoni and Boys San groups, the former often regarded in Italy as the first full-fledged ultras group (associated with violence). The term &quot;ultras&quot; was used as a name for the first time in 1969, when supporters of Sampdoria formed the Ultras Tito Cucchiaroni and fans of Torino formed the Ultras Granata. The style of support that would become synonymous with Italian football developed most during the 1970s, as more groups formed, including the radical S.S. Lazio Ultras in 1974, with a strong predominance of fascist slogans and chants amongst other groups such as Hellas Verona supporters. The active support of the ultras became more apparent, in contrast with the &quot;traditional&quot; culture, choreographic displays, signature banners and symbols, giant flags, drums and fireworks became the norm as groups aimed to take their support to higher levels. The decade also saw the violence and unrest of Italian society at the time overlap with the ultras movement, adding a dimension that has plagued it ever since. The ultras movement spread across Europe, Australia, Asia and North Africa during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, starting with the countries geographically closest to Italy.

==Characteristics==
Ultras groups are usually centred on a core group of founders or leaders (who tend to hold executive control), with smaller subgroups organised by location, friendship or political stance. Ultras tend to use various styles and sizes of banners and flags bearing the name and symbols of their group. Some ultras groups sell their own merchandise to raise funds for performing displays. An ultras group can number from a handful of fans to hundreds or thousands, with larger groups often claiming entire sections of a stadium for themselves. Ultras groups often have a representative who liaises with the club owners on a regular basis, mostly regarding tickets, seat allocations and storage facilities. Some clubs provide groups with cheaper tickets, storage rooms for flags and banners and early access to the stadium before matches to prepare displays. These types of favoured relationships are often criticised when ultras groups abuse their power.

===Hooliganism===

While ultras groups can become violent, the majority of matches attended by ultras conclude with no violent incidents. Unlike hooligan firms, whose main aim is to fight hooligans of other clubs, the main focus of ultras is generally to support their own team Some hooligans try to be inconspicuous when they travel; usually not wearing team colours, to avoid detection by the police. Within the ultra or hooligan culture however, those dressing to &quot;blend in&quot; would be referred to as casuals, which is viewed by some as a branch of hooliganism, yet still maintaining its own independence and culture. Ultras tend to be more conspicuous when they travel, proudly displaying their scarves and club colours while arriving &quot;en masse&quot;, which allows the police to keep a close eye on their movements.

In April 2024, following the inception of the group and a subsequent meeting with club officials, an Aston Villa F.C. supporters group called &quot;1897 Group&quot; were allocated a section of the club&#x27;s home stadium Villa Park for a Premier League match against A.F.C.

=== Italy ===

In Italy, most professional football clubs have an ultras group which attends every match and has dedicated seating areas in either the north or south end of the stadium behind the goals. Each ultras group will have one or more leaders who choreograph chants, and who hand out banners and flags to other people in the stand to wave throughout the match. Ultras have been credited with creating fantastic atmospheres inside the stadium; however they have also come under universal criticism because of ties to various gangs and the mafia, as well as causing violence which often takes place outside the stadium prior to a match. Over the years inappropriate chanting has resulted in the FIGC issuing partial or full stadium bans to clubs. The ultras will choreograph a wide range of chants throughout a match, but some of the most common chants that result in a ban are anti-Southern chants towards clubs which are located in the South of Italy, most notably towards Napoli, as well as racist chants towards opposition players. However, these issues only partially represent parts of the Ultras culture in Italy – Ultras in Italy are also known for fighting criminals and the Mafia, giving housing to immigrants or helping Italian citizens in need, as well as aiding with food and money during the Covid pandemic to their local hospitals.

Prior to the Arab Club Champions Cup game between Nejmeh and Al-Ahly of Egypt, played on 13 August 2018, seven &quot;Ultras Supernova&quot; fans were arrested by the Egyptian national security because of the negative connotations the word &quot;Ultras&quot; has in Egypt. The fans have been returned to Lebanon by request of the Lebanese Ambassador to Cairo.

The ultras scene in India was introduced by East Bengal Ultras, the ultras group of East Bengal FC, in 2013, and since then it grew slowly, as ultras groups of various clubs started to form and display of &quot;&quot;Tifo&quot;&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Pyro&quot; shows became very much a part of the ultras scene in Indian football.

Blue Pilgrims is an organised group of football fans who support the India national football men&#x27;s team, women&#x27;s team, and all the other age – group national teams at every home and away game, formed by a group of football fans of several club fan bases of football clubs from India. Founded in 2017 before the commencement of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, which was held in India, the group based their name on the nickname of the national team, the &quot;Blue Tigers&quot;. They consider travelling with the national teams, to wherever the teams play, as their pilgrimage. They often display flags, banners, and tifos in support of the national team.

===Iran===

<doc id="1001861" wikidata="Q837424" url="?curid=1001861" title="Nanjing anti-African protests">
<text>The Nanjing anti-African protests were mass demonstrations and riots against African students in Nanjing, China, which lasted from December 1988 to the following January.

==Protests==
On December 24, 1988, two male African students were entering their campus at Hohai University in Nanjing with two Chinese women. The occasion was a Christmas Eve party. A quarrel between one of the Africans and a Chinese security guard, who had suspected that the women the African students tried to bring into the campus were prostitutes and refused their entry, led to a brawl between all the African and Chinese students on the campus which lasted till the morning, leaving 13 students injured. The brawl included other African students besides the two stopped by the security guards.

300 Chinese students, spurred by false rumors that a Chinese man had been killed by the Africans, broke into and set about destroying the Africans&#x27; dormitories, shouting slogans. Part of the destruction involved setting fire to the Africans&#x27; dormitory and locking them in. The President of the university had to order the fire department to take action.

After the police had dispersed the Chinese students, many Africans fled to the railway station in order to gain safety at various African embassies in Beijing. The authorities prevented the Africans from boarding the trains so as to question those involved in the brawl. Soon their numbers increased to 140, as other African and non-African foreign students, fearing violence or simply by sympathy, arrived at the first-class waiting room at the station asking to be allowed to go to Beijing.

By this time, Chinese students from Hohai University had joined up with students from other Nanjing universities to make up a 3000-strong demonstration that called on government officials to prosecute the African students and reform the system which gave foreign students more rights than Chinese students. On the evening of December 26, the marchers converged on the railway station while holding banners calling for human rights and political reform. Chinese police managed to isolate the non-Chinese students from the marchers and moved them by force to a military guest house in Yizheng outside Nanjing. The protests were declared illegal, and riot police were brought in from surrounding provinces to pacify the demonstrators, which took several more days.

The African students and their sympathizers were removed from Yizheng to another military guesthouse closer to Nanjing on New Year&#x27;s Eve, and were returned to their universities the following day.

==Aftermath==
In January, three of the African students were deported for starting the brawl. An African student claimed he was electrocuted on the genitals. The other students returned to Hohai University and were required to follow new regulations, including a night-time curfew, having to report to university authorities before leaving the campus. Guests were still required to be registered.

Anti-African demonstrations spread to other cities, including Shanghai and Beijing.

==Tiananmen Square protests==
The Nanjing protests were groundbreaking dissidence for China and went from solely expressing concern about alleged improprieties by African men to increasingly calling for democracy or human rights. They were paralleled by burgeoning demonstrations in other cities during the period between the Nanjing and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, with some elements of the original protests that started in Nanjing still evident in 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, such as banners proclaiming &quot;Stop Taking Advantage of Chinese Women&quot; even though the vast majority of African students had left the country by that point.

<doc id="1001868" wikidata="Q1214862" url="?curid=1001868" title="North of 60">
<text>North of 60 is a 1990s Canadian television drama depicting life in the sub-Arctic northern boreal forest (north of 60° north latitude, hence the title). It first aired on CBC Television in 1992 and was syndicated around the world. It is set in the fictional community of Lynx River, a Canadian Indigenous community depicted as being in the Dehcho Region, Northwest Territories.

Most of the characters were Dene. Some non-native characters had important roles: the restaurant/motel owner (a Ukrainian immigrant), the band manager, the nurse (a white Canadian woman) and (during the show&#x27;s first season) the town&#x27;s RCMP Detachment Commander. The show explored themes of Native poverty, alcoholism, cultural preservation, conflict over land settlements, and natural resource exploitation.

Originally somewhat light-hearted (a CBC response to the very successful &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; on CBS), it quickly became a more sombre dramatic series which explored subplots including murder, band corruption, economic depression, mental health and the death of a child (owing to actress Selina Hanuse, who played Hannah Kenidi, leaving the show to pursue her education in Season 3). There were also romantic and sexual subplots between unlikely characters, giving the show a distinctive soap opera-like atmosphere not hugely common in Canadian government-sponsored media at the time. This included scenes depicting brief sex, nudity and profanity, as well as discussion in one episode about HIV/AIDS and the social stigma faced by a young boy who was a male prostitute with the disease.

==Casting==
Starring in the series were Tina Keeper as RCMP Constable, later Corporal, Michelle Kenidi, Tracey Cook as Sarah Birkett (nurse during first year), Tom Jackson as Peter Kenidi (band chief in first year, Michelle&#x27;s brother), Gordon Tootoosis as Albert Golo (bootlegger, then band chief), Dakota House as Trevor &#x27;Teevee&#x27; Tenia (teen trouble-maker, then band chief), Lubomir Mykytiuk as Gerry Kisilenko (restaurant/motel owner/justice of the peace), Jimmy Herman as Joe Gomba (elder) and Simon R. Baker as Charlie Muskrat. Adam Beach and Tantoo Cardinal also starred. Elsie Tsa Che (Wilma Pelly) was a fan favorite, playing Teevee&#x27;s grandmother, a community elder. John Oliver led the cast as Corporal Eric Olsen during the show&#x27;s first two seasons and entered into an off-screen relationship with co-star Keeper; he left the show when his relationship with Keeper soured. Keeper subsequently became the show&#x27;s lead actor for the remainder of its run. Oliver was replaced by Robert Bockstael as Corporal Brian Fletcher, who was replaced later by Peter Kelly Gaudreault as Constable James Harper.

One of the stars was Michael Horse, as Andrew One Sky, previously best known for his portrayal of Deputy Hawk in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and as Tonto in the 1981 film &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot;. Tom Jackson also performed as Billy Twofeathers on &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; and was also a well-known singer and philanthropist in Canada.

==Series==
The series ran weekly until 1997, and followed seasonal changes in character arcs:

===Season 1===
RCMP Corporal Eric Olson moves to Lynx River from an undercover drug operation in Vancouver, becoming acquainted with the town&#x27;s issues and citizens. Events of note include a physical run-in with local bad boy Trevor Victor &quot;Teevee&quot; Tenia, Eric&#x27;s divorce from his wife, Michelle coping with an abusive former teacher who bullied her at the residential school, Leon trying to quit drinking (and subsequently marrying Rosie), a girl named Donna struggling with the impacts of fetal alcohol syndrome, Sarah having a romance with Eric, Teevee threatening to air an amateur porno tape he made of Eric and Sarah that he recorded while playing peeping tom in Sarah&#x27;s window, Teevee running away to Vancouver and having a bad experience with local male prostitute and hustler Nevada, and Michelle trying to cope with the loss of her and Hannah&#x27;s house in a fire, among other things. Sarah struggles to fit in as a white woman and is at odds with Ellen over the debate of having a natural home birth versus a hospital birth in Yellowknife. Albert Golo is shot by an unknown gunman after Leon and Rey pass out drunk in the cold, and Rey (Leon&#x27;s best friend) freezes to death. Peter is revealed to have had an affair using Band money to pay for his mistress&#x27;s accommodations, which Harris had helped to cover up.

===Season 2===
Season 2&#x27;s main plot device revolves around the town&#x27;s dealings with an Italian brother-and-sister duo involved with fashion design who help to fund the building of a tannery in Lynx River. This raises the ire of two liberal animal rights activists who cause conflict regarding animal welfare versus Native ways of hunting and trapping. Gerry invests fifty-thousand dollars (his life&#x27;s savings) in the tannery at Harris and Peter&#x27;s goading, while Harris begins a sexual romance with Lois Tenia, much to Teevee&#x27;s disgust. Teevee himself deals with fatherhood after getting Bertha pregnant, while Sarah has a mental breakdown and becomes lost in the bush. After a stint in a mental hospital, she begins an apparent sexual relationship with Albert, which upsets the other townsfolk. Hannah struggles with being &quot;the Mountie&#x27;s kid&quot; and begins acting out rebelliously, while Teevee learns how to write grant proposals and raise the morale of the Lynx River children. Eric is horrified after his teenage son, Andy, begins expressing racism towards the Native residents of the town, a bigoted attitude which he apparently picked up from his mother&#x27;s new boyfriend, Bill. After the Italian siblings are charged with international fraud, the tannery project fails, Gerry loses all of his money, and Rosie begins drinking again. Michelle shoots and kills Andre, a violent man, during a hostage situation.

===Season 3===
Albert is elected chief of Lynx River, replacing Peter and leaving the town with a serious alcoholism problem. Rosie recovers after a cathartic experience with Sarah on the riverbank, and Gerry reluctantly hires Rosie back to work as his business partner. Betty Moses, an abrasive but kind-hearted woman, attempts to run a treatment centre in town and finds that Sarah is a surprisingly beloved friend of her patients. Bertha returns and shacks up in her grandmother&#x27;s dilapidated house, where Teevee and their infant daughter gradually move in. Peter struggles with his hopes to move to Ottawa for business in conflict with his desire to stay home, and a pompous artist, Ben Montour, arrives in Lynx River with an alcohol problem, sleeping with Lois, much to Harris&#x27;s chagrin. Hannah steals a boombox from Gerry&#x27;s store and Michelle tries to reconcile with her, trying to find out where the bad behaviour is coming from. Olsen is murdered in a shooting while out of town, and his estranged ex-wife arrives with invasive demands, which bothers Sarah and Michelle. Brian Fletcher, a new RCMP officer, takes Olsen&#x27;s place. Nathan Golo recruits Teevee into bootlegging, Sarah leaves Albert, and Nathan is caught, resulting in him being banned from the community. Teevee is reunited with Nevada, who reveals that he is HIV positive.

===Season 4===
Sarah gives birth to Albert&#x27;s child (a daughter named Elizabeth), which puts her in a precarious situation as Albert and her own estranged white family fight over custody of the child. Gerry has a nervous breakdown after a series of unfortunate events befall him, and Rosie learns that Gerry&#x27;s own family in Ukraine was impacted by the Holodomor in the 1930s. Nathan begins developing mental health issues due to his ban, and Hannah returns to Lynx River, now wearing punk garb and having a noticeably different attitude. She goes missing in the city, and Michelle searches for her, reuniting with Hannah&#x27;s father and meeting a man named Andrew One Sky who both aid her. Rosie learns secrets about the murder of her beloved father two decades prior. Brian Fletcher brings his wife, Rosemary (a devout Christian) to Lynx River, where they both struggle with marital problems due to their inability to conceive a child, including a miscarriage that is difficult on both of them. Teevee argues with Bertha after meeting a new partner (Anne-Marie), and Harris and Lois plan to marry. Gerry reveals that he has romantic feelings for Rosie, and Michelle meets Charlie Muskrat, the child of a chronic alcoholic who needs a more supportive place to stay. Michelle also learns that Hannah was killed in a fall from a high bridge, which shatters her emotionally; Rosie&#x27;s son, Wayne, also struggles deeply with Hannah&#x27;s loss, while Betty Moses pushes Michelle to get rid of Hannah&#x27;s belongings as a gesture of letting go of the tragedy, something that Michelle finds intrusive.

===Season 5===
Teevee invests in a sawmill project to earn an honest living, while Brian and Rosemary consider adopting a child. Michelle becomes a mother figure for Charlie. Sarah struggles with Albert over custody of Elizabeth, and this leads to Joe Gumba deciding to adopt Sarah as his own daughter, which will keep Elizabeth raised in a Dene way but prevent Albert from encroaching on Sarah&#x27;s parenthood. Andrew One Sky keeps a relationship with Michelle, but decides that he wants to try to run his own business, which Albert attempts to sabotage. Leon goes away on business, leaving Rosie alone. She becomes closer with Gerry, but Gerry then learns that Leon is cheating on her and wonders whether to keep it a secret or not in order to protect Rosie&#x27;s feelings. Brian expresses lust for Sarah, which Sarah doesn&#x27;t reciprocate. Brian then becomes increasingly erratic and commits suicide - or so it appears. Albert&#x27;s house burns down and he disappears, but Sarah believes that the fire was deliberate and that Albert is still alive somewhere. Conflicts arise over the building of a new road and the future of Lynx River, while Charlie deals with his difficult past and traumatic upbringing. Gerry distracts himself from Rosie with a short-lived relationship involving a surly loan officer, who later dumps Gerry for a Revenue Canada employee in a bizarre affair. Nathan Golo grows closer with Sarah but is torn between caring for her and wanting to help Albert.

===Season 6===
Constable James Harper replaces Brian Fletcher, but Michelle is still suspicious over Brian&#x27;s inexplicable suicide. The road-building commences in Lynx River, giving Teevee a job, which also leads him to learn about the consequences of radicalism when he gets involved with a leftist group protesting the project and expressing this with violence. Michelle is attacked, leading to an investigation, while Rosie finds out about Leon&#x27;s cheating and confronts him about it. Lois has a baby, and Manfred and Teevee become struck in a blizzard, forced to huddle together for warmth in order to survive, which oddly brings them closer together as friends. Michelle returns to work but acts strangely around Charlie, leading her to consider quitting her RCMP job. Sarah and Nathan discover disturbing news about Albert when he returns to Lynx River. Gerry considers leaving Lynx River, and reveals more about his troubled past and family to Rosie; the two finally admit to having romantic feelings for one another, sharing a kiss. Peter struggles with the consequences of his tax corruption. Harper finally has the means to arrest Albert, but Albert himself is terminally ill and has different plans for how he wants to go down, confronting Joe Gumba about it.

*Character Brian Fletcher&#x27;s suicide is explored further in subsequent &quot;North of 60&quot; follow-up films.

==Telefilms==
After the end of filming on the series, a series of telemovies were made. From 1999 through 2005 there were five made-for-TV films featuring various members of the show&#x27;s recurring cast. These movies include &quot;In The Blue Ground&quot; (1999), &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; (2000), &quot;Dream Storm&quot; (2001), &quot;Another Country&quot; (2003), and &quot;Distant Drumming&quot; (2005).

==Production==

A soundtrack album was produced in 1994, including theme music, background music and songs performed by Tom Jackson and others. Other background soundtracks for the series, which were never listed in the credits for the episodes, were generally by Canadian bands and included various samples from Tom Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;No Regrets&quot;, as well as &quot;Just Another Day&quot; by Kevin Jordan, &quot;E Uassiuian&quot; by Kashtin, &quot;Honky Tonk Choir Boy&quot; by Chris Ward, &quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot; by The Tragically Hip (t-shirts from the band&#x27;s concert in this particular instance were featured, as character Hannah had attended a concert by The Tragically Hip in Calgary as part of an episode storyline in Season 4), and a number of other songs, mostly unidentified folk rock and country.

This series was filmed in Bragg Creek, Alberta. Its provincial park appears in many episodes as well as the television films. The set for the town of Lynx River itself was a series of facsimile buildings, fully functioning and contained within a small area, designed by Douglas Higgins.

==Cultural impact==
&quot;North of 60&quot; has been listed as an important exploration of Indigenous culture and Canadian life in rural areas, as well as one of few fictional depictions of Indigenous cultures in a thoughtful and realistic way. After the show had ceased airing on television, fans gathered to request re-airings of the existing episodes on television, as well as a DVD video release of all 6 seasons. While no DVD release ever happened, APTN (Aboriginal Peoples Television Network) decided to routinely re-air episodes of &quot;North of 60&quot;, with APTN CEO Jean La Rose stating, &quot;when the show originally aired in 1992 it became the most popular series in Canadian history, drawing almost a million viewers per week. It’s apparent that fans miss the show and would love to see it back on the air. APTN has been listening and is thrilled to bring the show back to Canadian television!&quot; APTN also offers digital streaming of the series on its own website. 

&quot;North of 60&quot; has developed a cult following, including a consistently active but private Facebook group with over 10,000 members, and a fan website featuring interviews from multiple actors and actresses from the show; the website, created by longtime fan Patty Winter, was featured in the university textbook &quot;Outside Looking In: Viewing First Nations Peoples in Canadian Dramatic Television Series&quot; by Mary Jane Miller.

&quot;North of 60&quot; is mostly in Canadian English, although Slavey language, Canadian French and Ukrainian language were incorporated. Lubomir Mykytiuk, who played Gerry Kisilenko, had incorporated Ukrainian language and a song into the show (during character Harris Miller&#x27;s wedding), and for a scene involving a family scrapbook from Ukraine, Mykytiuk (who was born in Ukraine himself) brought in his own family photos for the scene. According to Mykytiuk, &quot;it&#x27;s a lovely story with the scrapbook because the art director actually called my mum in Montreal and asked whether she had any pictures of me when I was a child. So that helped. It was quite something.&quot;

<doc id="1001877" wikidata="Q555292" url="?curid=1001877" title="Steve Stone (footballer)">
<text>Steven Brian Stone (born 20 August 1971) is an English football coach and former professional player.

As a player, he was a right midfielder who notably played in the Premier League for Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa and Portsmouth. Whilst with Forest he won the First Division title and played in the UEFA Cup. He also played in the 2000 FA Cup final for Villa. He finished his career with a brief spell in the Football League with Leeds United. He was capped nine times by England, scoring twice. He was part of England&#x27;s Euro 96 team and made three appearances during the tournament.

Following retirement, Stone moved into coaching and worked for Newcastle United from July 2010 to June 2015 in a variety of different roles for both the first and reserve team. He was head coach of Burnley&#x27;s under-23 team between 2018 and 2022.

==Club career==
Stone was born in Gateshead. He began his career at Nottingham Forest.

Forest moved to Aston Villa for £5.5 million in March 1999. He was transferred to Portsmouth for the 2002–03 season. In June 2005, he signed a two-year deal with Leeds United.

Stone&#x27;s career at Leeds was short-lived. He was injured in training as soon as he joined the club, and it took him most of his first season to recover from the tendinitis in his Achilles tendon due to contracting MRSA after the operation and then requiring a further two operations for the MRSA. Stone played a few matches at the end of the 2005–06 campaign, and continued to play at the start of the 2006–07 campaign, scoring once against West Brom. Injuries, however, struck again, and Stone retired early on 15 December 2006.

==International career==
Stone was capped nine times at senior level for England. He made his debut in October 1995, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 draw against Norway. Four days later, again coming off the bench, Stone scored his first international goal in a 3–1 win over Switzerland at Wembley Stadium. He also scored in his next game, which was his first start, as England drew 1–1 with Portugal.

Stone was capped three more times in the build-up to UEFA Euro 1996, where he was selected by manager Terry Venables as part of the 22-man England squad. He made three appearances during the competition, all off the bench. Stone&#x27;s introduction during extra-time of the quarter-final versus Spain was his last appearance for England.

==Coaching career==
On 27 July 2010, he was appointed reserve team assistant manager to Peter Beardsley at Newcastle United after a successful time working at their academy. Stone was promoted to first team coach on 14 December 2010, by new manager Alan Pardew.

Stone remained as first team coach after Pardew resigned to join Crystal Palace, with John Carver put in charge of Newcastle until the end of the season. On 9 June 2015, both he and Carver had their contracts terminated by Newcastle ahead of the announcement of Steve McClaren as new head coach.

On 12 November 2018, he replaced Michael Duff as the new U23 manager of Burnley.

Stone was dismissed on 15 April 2022, alongside first team manager Sean Dyche and fellow coach and former Forest teammate Ian Woan. Stone then followed Dyche to Everton in January 2023 where he worked until his dismissal in January 2025.

==Personal life==
Stone featured in the music video to the football song &quot;Three Lions&quot;, where he dances with the trophy mimicking Nobby Stiles at the 1966 FIFA World Cup final.

<doc id="1001880" wikidata="Q437462" url="?curid=1001880" title="Octavia Hill">
<text>Octavia Hill (3December 183813August 1912) was an English social reformer and a founder of the National Trust. Her main concern was the welfare of the inhabitants of cities, especially London, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Born into a family of radical thinkers and reformers with a strong commitment to alleviating poverty, she herself grew up in straitened circumstances owing to the financial failure of her father&#x27;s businesses. Home educated by her mother, she worked from the age of 14 for the welfare of working people.

Hill was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with John Ruskin enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal.

Another of Hill&#x27;s concerns was the availability of open spaces for poor people. She campaigned against development on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save London&#x27;s Hampstead Heath and Parliament Hill Fields from being built on. She was one of the three founders of the National Trust, set up to preserve places of historic interest or natural beauty for the enjoyment of the British public. She was a founder member of the Charity Organisation Society (now the charity Family Action) which organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work. She was a member of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws in 1905.

Hill&#x27;s legacy includes the large holdings of the modern National Trust, several housing projects still run on her lines, a tradition of training for housing managers, and the Octavia Hill Birthplace House established by the Octavia Hill Society at her birthplace in Wisbech. She was key in pushing for the creation of what is now known as the Army Cadet Force, after seeing the success it was having in schools who maintained detachments of the Officers&#x27; Training Corps (now known as the Combined Cadet Force).

==Biography==

===Early years===
Octavia Hill was born on 3 December 1838 in Bank House (now named the Octavia Hill Birthplace House), South Brink, Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, the daughter of James Hill, a corn merchant, former banker and follower of Robert Owen, and his third wife, Caroline Southwood Smith. James Hill had been widowed twice, and had six surviving children (five daughters and a son) from his two previous marriages; Octavia was her father&#x27;s eighth daughter and tenth child. He had been impressed by the writings on education of his future wife, the daughter of Dr Thomas Southwood Smith, a pioneer of sanitary reform. He engaged Caroline as a governess to his children in 1832, and they were married in 1835. The family&#x27;s comfortably prosperous life was disrupted by James Hill&#x27;s financial problems and his mental collapse. In 1840, he was declared bankrupt. Caroline Hill&#x27;s father gave the family financial support, and took on some of Hill&#x27;s paternal role.

Southwood Smith was a health and welfare reformer concerned with a range of social issues including child labour in mines and the housing of the urban poor. Caroline Hill held similar views on social reform, and her interest in progressive education, influenced by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, and Southwood Smith&#x27;s daily experience in his work at the London Hospital in the East End inspired Octavia Hill&#x27;s concern for the poorest in early Victorian London. She received no formal schooling: her mother educated the family at home.

The family settled in a small cottage in Finchley, now a north London suburb, but then a village. Octavia Hill was impressed and moved by Henry Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot;, a book that portrayed the daily lives of slum dwellers. She was also strongly influenced by the theologian, Anglican priest and social reformer F. D. Maurice, who was a family friend. She began her work on behalf of London&#x27;s poor by helping to make toys for Ragged school children, and serving as secretary of the women&#x27;s classes at the Working Men&#x27;s College in Bloomsbury in central London.

A co-operative guild providing employment for &quot;distressed gentlewomen&quot; accepted Hill for training in glass-painting when she was 13. When the work of the guild was expanded to provide work in toy-making for Ragged school children, she was invited, at the age of 14, to take charge of the workroom. The following year she began working in her spare time from the guild as a copyist for John Ruskin in Dulwich Art Gallery and the National Gallery. She was deeply aware of the dreadful living conditions of the children in her charge at the guild.

Her views on encouraging self-reliance led to her association with the Charity Organisation Society (COS), described by Hill&#x27;s biographer Gillian Darley as &quot;a contentious body which deplored dependence fostered by kindly but unrigorous philanthropy ... support to the poor had to be carefully targeted and efficiently supervised. Later in life, however, she began to think the COS line ... was over-harsh.&quot; It introduced the Elberfeld system to Britain.

Hill was short, like all her family, and indifferent to fashion. Her friend Henrietta Barnett wrote: &quot;She was small in stature with a long body and short legs. She did not dress, she only wore clothes, which were often unnecessarily unbecoming; she had soft and abundant hair and regular features, but the beauty of her face lay in brown and very luminous eyes, which quite unconsciously she lifted upwards as she spoke on any matter for which she cared. Her mouth was large and mobile, but not improved by laughter. Indeed, Miss Octavia was nicest when she was made passionate by her earnestness.&quot;

Barnett also spoke of Hill&#x27;s streak of ruthlessness. Gertrude Bell called Hill despotic. Later in Hill&#x27;s life, the Bishop of London, Frederick Temple, encountered her at a meeting of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and wrote, &quot;She spoke for half an hour … I never had such a beating in all my life.&quot;

===Housing for the poor===
Parliament and many concerned reformers had been attempting to improve the housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been in existence for twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban well-being, and the first of many tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed. From Hill&#x27;s point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. She found that their landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that the tenants were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves. She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself.

John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her. As an aesthete and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of the slums. In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for £750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, Marylebone. The obituary for Octavia Hill, published by The Times 15 August 1912 quoted that Hill herself confessed &quot;not many men would have trusted that the undertaking would succeed&quot;.

Ruskin placed these houses, which were &quot;in a dreadful state of dirt and neglect&quot;, under Hill&#x27;s management. He told her that investors might be attracted to such schemes if a five per cent annual return could be secured. In 1866 Ruskin acquired the freehold of five more houses for Hill to manage in Freshwater Place, Marylebone. &quot;The Times&quot; recorded, &quot;The houses faced a bit of desolate ground occupied by dilapidated cowsheds and manure heaps. The needful repairs and cleaning were carried out, the waste land was turned into a playground where Mr. Ruskin had some trees planted.&quot;

After being improved the properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. A return of five per cent on capital was obtained as promised to Ruskin; any excess over the five per cent was reinvested within the properties for the benefit of the tenants. Rent arrears were not tolerated, and bad debts were minimal. As Hill said, &quot;Extreme punctuality, and diligence in collecting rents, and a strict determination that they shall be paid regularly, have accomplished this.&quot; In consequence of her prudent management, Hill was able to attract new backers, and by 1874 she had 15 housing schemes with around 3,000 tenants.

Hill&#x27;s system was based on closely managing not only the buildings but the tenants; she insisted, &quot;you cannot deal with the people and their houses separately&quot; and she strongly believed that good quality, well-managed homes make for happier, healthier lives. She maintained close personal contact with all her tenants, and was strongly opposed to impersonal bureaucratic organisations and to governmental intervention in housing. In her view, &quot;municipal socialism and subsidized housing&quot; led to indiscriminate demolition, re-housing schemes, and the destruction of communities.

===Housing management===
At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants (who included Emma Cons and Eva McLaren) combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers. At first Hill believed, &quot;Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers.&quot; Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce. Her system required a large staff. Rent was collected on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Rent accounts were balanced in the afternoons and arrangements were made with contractors for repairs. On Thursdays and Fridays arrears were pursued, contractors&#x27; invoices paid, new tenancy lettings and tenants&#x27; moves organised.

If any of Hill&#x27;s assistants had spare time, whether during normal working hours or in frequent voluntary after-hours working, it was used to promote tenants&#x27; associations and after-work and children&#x27;s after-school clubs and societies. In 1859, Hill created the Southwark detachment of the Army Cadet Force, its first independent unit, which gave training along military lines for local boys. Hill considered that such an organisation would be more like the &quot;real thing&quot; than such existing outfits as the Church Lads&#x27; Brigade and therefore more attractive to young men &quot;who had passed the age of make-believe&quot;. She invited a serving officer of the Derbyshire Regiment to set up the company, and such was its popularity that its numbers had to be capped at 160 cadets.
Hill&#x27;s principles were summed up in an article of 1869: &quot;Where a man persistently refuses to exert himself, external help is worse than useless.&quot; She was an outspoken critic of the principles of &quot;outdoor relief&quot; or the Speenhamland system of poor relief as operated by various Poor Law Boards. Because these systems did not encourage recipients to work, she regarded them as &quot;a profligate use of public funds.&quot; Under her methods, personal responsibility was encouraged. She insisted on dealing with arrears promptly; she appointed reliable caretakers; she took up on references of prospective tenants, and visited them in their homes; she paid careful attention to allocations and the placing of tenants, with regard to size of families and the size and location of the accommodation to be offered; and she made no rules that could not be properly enforced.

In 1884, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners recognised her enlightened approach and turned to her to manage and reform 48 of their slum properties in South London, which were notorious for poverty and petty crime. Hill turned these estates into model properties, which still paid a return on investment.

An American admirer described her as &quot;ruling over a little kingdom of three thousand loving subjects with an iron scepter twined with roses.&quot; Although Hill drove her associates hard, she drove herself harder. In 1877, she collapsed and had to take a break of several months from her work. Darley ascribes a number of contributory causes: &quot;chronic overwork, a lack of delegation, the death of her close friend Jane Senior, the failure of a brief engagement&quot;, as well as an attack on her by John Ruskin. The Hill family found a companion for her, Harriot Yorke (1843–1930). Yorke took on a great amount of the everyday work that had contributed to Hill&#x27;s collapse. She remained her companion until Hill&#x27;s death. A further palliative was the building of a cottage, at Crockham Hill near Sevenoaks in Kent, where they could take breaks from their work in London.

===Open spaces===

Among Hill&#x27;s concerns was that her tenants, and all urban workers, should have access to open spaces. She believed in &quot;the life-enhancing virtues of pure earth, clean air and blue sky.&quot; In 1883 she wrote:
She campaigned hard against building on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save Hampstead Heath and Parliament Hill Fields from development. She was the first to use the term &quot;Green Belt&quot; in 1875 for the protected rural areas surrounding London and prevent the city sprawling out. Three hills in Kent (Mariners Hill, Toys Hill and Ide Hill) which she helped to protect from development form part of the belt.

In 1876 Hill became the treasurer of the Kyrle Society, founded in that year by her eldest sister, Miranda, as a &quot;Society for the Diffusion of Beauty&quot;. Under the slogan &quot;Bring Beauty Home to the Poor&quot; it aimed to bring art, books, music and open spaces into the lives of the urban poor. For a short period it flourished and expanded, and although it declined after a few years, it was a template for the National Trust, 20 years later.

Before that, however, Hill was engaged in a campaign in 1883 to stop the construction of railways from the quarries in the fells overlooking Buttermere, in the English Lake District, with damaging effect on the unspoilt scenery. The campaign was led by Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, who secured the support of Ruskin, Hill, and Sir Robert Hunter, solicitor to the Commons Preservation Society. From 1875 onwards, Hunter had been Hill&#x27;s legal adviser on the protection of open spaces in London. Both he and Rawnsley, building on an idea put forward by Ruskin, conceived of a trust that could buy and preserve places of natural beauty and historic interest for the nation.

On 16 November 1893, Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley met in the offices of the Commons Preservation Society and agreed to launch such a trust. Hill suggested that it should be called &quot;The Commons and Gardens Trust&quot;, but the three agreed to adopt Hunter&#x27;s suggested title, the &quot;National Trust&quot;. Under its full formal title, the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty was inaugurated the following year. The trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and endangered buildings of historic interest; its first property was Dinas Oleu, Merioneth, its first built property was Alfriston Clergy House and its first nature reserve was Wicken Fen.

===Later years===
The number of homes managed by Hill continued to grow. Although Ruskin had turned against her in a bout of mental instability, she found a new supporter, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who handed over to her the management of their housing estates in several poor areas of south London. By the end of the nineteenth century, Hill&#x27;s women workers were no longer unpaid volunteers but trained professionals. Hill&#x27;s influence spread beyond the properties under her own control. Her ideas were taken up and copied, with her enthusiastic support, in continental Europe and the United States of America. Beatrice Webb said that she &quot;first became aware of the meaning of the poverty of the poor,&quot; while staying with her sister, who was a rent collector for Octavia Hill in the East End. Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughter, Princess Alice of Hesse-Darmstadt, was taken incognito on a tour of some of Hill&#x27;s properties, and she translated Hill&#x27;s &quot;Homes of the London Poor&quot; into German.

Among those whom Hill trained was her assistant and secretary, Maud Jeffery, who was later engaged by the Commissioners of Crown Lands to run new housing estates in London on Octavia Hill&#x27;s lines. Even some local authorities, despite Hill&#x27;s distrust, followed her model: some of the earliest examples of municipal council housing, at Kensington and Camberwell, were run on her lines, with the acquisition of working-class houses, and their gradual improvement, without evictions or demolitions.

Despite her opposition to interference by national or local government in the provision of housing, Hill had to cope with the newly created London County Council and the involvement of the council and other local authorities in providing housing for the poor. In 1884 a Royal commission on the housing of the working classes was set up, but the prime minister, W.E. Gladstone, and his ministerial colleagues vetoed a proposal to include Hill among the members of the commission. The municipal authorities quickly surpassed her in the number of properties under their management.

A.S. Wohl notes that in the 1880s Hill had about £70,000 worth of property under her management, and at the end of her career she was managing the dwellings of &quot;perhaps three or four thousand people at the most.&quot; The London County Council, by contrast, had a budget of £1,500,000 for its programme of rehousing London&#x27;s poor in 1901–02.

Hill was opposed to other reforms that came about in the early part of the twentieth century. She was against female suffrage on the grounds that &quot;men and women help one another because they are different, have different gifts and different spheres.&quot; She also believed that provision of social services and old-age pensions by the government did more harm than good, sapping people&#x27;s self-reliance.

Hill died from cancer on 13 August 1912 at her home in Marylebone, at the age of 73.

==Legacy and memorials==
When John Singer Sargent&#x27;s portrait of her was presented by her fellow-workers in 1898, Hill made a speech in which she said, &quot;When I am gone, I hope my friends will not try to carry out any special system, or to follow blindly in the track which I have trodden. New circumstances require various efforts, and it is the spirit, not the dead form, that should be perpetuated. We shall leave them a few houses, purified and improved, a few new and better ones built, a certain amount of thoughtful and loving management, a few open spaces...&quot; But, she said, more important would be &quot;the quick eye to see, the true soul to measure, the large hope to grasp the mighty issues of the new and better days to come – greater ideals, greater hope, and patience to realize both.&quot;

The Horace Street Trust, founded by Hill, became a model for many subsequent housing associations and developed into the present trust that bears her name, Octavia Housing. Today it owns several of the homes, including Gable Cottages, designed by Elijah Hoole, who worked with Hill for many years. Hill&#x27;s determination to provide community space can still be seen in the shape of the Red Cross site in Southwark (1888), among others. The Octavia Hill Society website states that with a community hall, and soundly maintained attractive houses, Hill here anticipated the fundamental ingredients of town planning by some 15 years.

The Settlement movement (creating integrated mixed communities of rich and poor) grew directly out of Hill&#x27;s work. Her colleagues Samuel and Henrietta Barnett, founded Toynbee Hall, the first university-sponsored settlement, which together with the Women&#x27;s University Settlement (later called the Blackfriars Settlement) continues to serve local communities. Overseas, Hill&#x27;s name is perpetuated in the Octavia Hill Association in Philadelphia, a small property company founded in 1896 to provide affordable housing to low and middle-income city residents.

Women who had trained under Hill formed the Association of Women Housing Workers in 1916. This later changed its name to the Society of Housing Managers in 1948. After merging with the Institute of Housing Managers in 1965, the society became the present day Chartered Institute of Housing in 1994. The CIH is a professional body for those working in the housing profession in the UK and overseas. The training that Hill gave to Charity Organisation Society volunteers contributed to the development of modern social work, and COS continued to be instrumental in developing social work as a profession during the twentieth century. COS is still in operation today as the charity Family Action.

In 1907, Parliament passed the first National Trust Act, enshrining the trust&#x27;s permanent purpose and giving it powers to protect property for the benefit of the nation. The trust now looks after a wide range of coast, countryside and historic buildings. According to the trust&#x27;s website, &quot;Staff, volunteers and tenants are engaged daily in providing access to open spaces for people&#x27;s enjoyment, providing habitats for wildlife and in improving our environment – &#x27;for ever, for everyone&#x27;.&quot;

A single grave marker for Miranda Hill, Octavia Hill and Harriot Yorke was placed in Holy Trinity churchyard, Crockham Hill, Kent.

Commemorations of Octavia Hill include a monument to her at a Surrey beauty spot, on the summit of a hill called Hydon&#x27;s Ball. Shortly after her death, the family erected a stone seat there, from which walkers can enjoy views over the Surrey countryside. The National Trust, who now own the site, has set up a commemorative guided walk that passes the seat, and two Octavia Hill Trails in Kent.

The Octavia Hill Society was set up in 1992 &quot;to promote awareness of the ideas and ideals of Octavia Hill, her family, fellow workers and their relevance in today&#x27;s society nationally and internationally&quot;. Under the society&#x27;s auspices her birthplace at Wisbech has been turned into the Octavia Hill Birthplace House. In 1995, to mark the centenary of the National Trust, a new variety of rose, &quot;Octavia Hill&quot;, was named in her honour. A zonal pelargonium &#x27;Octavia Hill&#x27; bred in Germany by plant-breeding company Elster PAC Jungpflanzen was launched at the Birthplace House in June 2009.

Octavia is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 13 August.

A housing development in the 1990s by Winchester Housing Group, now part of A2Dominion housing association, was named &quot;Octavia Hill&quot;.

In 2012 a memorial plate was unveiled in Westminster Abbey by the then chair of the National Trust, Simon Jenkins. The round stone tablet in the nave, notes her as a &quot;Social reformer and a founder of the National Trust&quot;.

<text>Simon &amp; Schuster LLC (, ) is an American publishing house owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts since 2023. It was founded in New York City in 1924, by Richard L. Simon and M. Lincoln Schuster. Along with Penguin Random House, Hachette, HarperCollins and Macmillan Publishers, Simon &amp; Schuster is considered one of the &#x27;Big Five&#x27; English language publishers. , Simon &amp; Schuster was the third largest publisher in the United States, publishing 2,000 titles annually under 35 different imprints.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
In 1924, Richard Simon&#x27;s aunt, a crossword puzzle enthusiast, asked whether there was a book of &quot;New York World&quot; crossword puzzles, which were popular at the time. After discovering that none had been published, Simon and Max Schuster decided to launch a company to exploit the opportunity. At the time, Simon was a piano salesman and Schuster was editor of an automotive trade magazine. They pooled , equivalent to $ today, to start a company that published crossword puzzles.

The new publishing house used &quot;fad&quot; publishing to publish books that exploited current fads and trends. Simon called this &quot;planned publishing&quot;. Instead of signing authors with a planned manuscript, they came up with their own ideas, and then hired writers to carry them out.

In the 1930s, the publisher moved to what has been referred to as &quot;Publisher&#x27;s Row&quot; on Park Avenue in Manhattan, New York.

=== Expansion ===
In 1939, Simon &amp; Schuster backed Robert Fair de Graff to found Pocket Books, America&#x27;s first paperback publisher. In 1942, Simon &amp; Schuster and Western Publishing launched the Little Golden Books series in cooperation with the Artists and Writers Guild.

In 1944, Marshall Field III, owner of the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot;, purchased Simon &amp; Schuster and Pocket Books. The company was sold back to Simon and Schuster following his death in 1957 for $1 million.

In the 1950s and 1960s, many publishers including Simon &amp; Schuster turned toward educational publishing due to the baby boom market. Pocket Books focused on paperbacks for the educational market instead of textbooks and started the Washington Square Press imprint in 1959. By 1964 it had published over 200 titles and was expected to put out another 400 by the end of that year. Books published under the imprint included classic reprints such as &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, and &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. In 1967, Simon &amp; Schuster acquired Monarch Press Publishing, Inc., along with its extensive line of college and high school study guides published.

In 1960, Richard Simon died of a heart attack; six years later, Max Schuster retired and sold his half of Simon &amp; Schuster to Leon Shimkin. Shimkin then merged Simon &amp; Schuster with Pocket Books under the name of Simon &amp; Schuster. In 1968, editor-in-chief Robert Gottlieb, who worked at Simon &amp; Schuster since 1955 and edited several bestsellers including Joseph Heller&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot;, left abruptly to work at competitor Knopf, taking other influential S&amp;S employees, Nina Bourne, and Tony Schulte.

Simon &amp; Schuster was acquired by Gulf+Western in an 8-for-1 stock swap on January 28, 1975. Four years later in 1979, Richard Snyder was named CEO of the company. Over the next several years he would help the company to grow substantially.

=== 1980s ===
After the death of Gulf+Western head Charles Bluhdorn on February 19, 1983, the company made the decision to diversify. Bluhdorn&#x27;s successor Martin Davis told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Society was undergoing dramatic changes so that there was a greater need for textbooks, maps, and educational information. We saw the opportunity to diversify into those areas, which are more stable and more profitable than trade publishing.&quot;

In 1984, Simon &amp; Schuster with CEO Richard E. Snyder acquired educational publisher Esquire Corporation, owner of companies including Allyn &amp; Bacon (and former owner of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine), for $180 million. Prentice Hall was brought into the company fold in 1985 for over $700 million and was viewed by some executives to be a catalyst for change for the company as a whole. This acquisition was followed by Silver Burdett in 1986, mapmaker Gousha in 1987 and Charles E. Simon in 1988. Part of the acquisition included educational publisher Allyn &amp; Bacon which, according to then editor and chief Michael Korda, became the &quot;nucleus of S&amp;S&#x27;s educational and informational business.&quot; Three California educational companies were also purchased between 1988 and 1990Quercus, Fearon Education and Janus Book Publishers. In all, Simon &amp; Schuster spent more than $1 billion in acquisitions between 1983 and 1991.

In the 1980s, Snyder also made an unsuccessful bid toward video publishing which was believed to have led to the company&#x27;s success in the audiobook business. Snyder was dismayed to realize that Simon &amp; Schuster did not own the video rights to &quot;Jane Fonda&#x27;s Workout Book&quot;, a huge bestseller at the time and that the video company producing the VHS was making more money on the video. This prompted Snyder to ask editors to obtain video rights for every new book. Agents were often reluctant to give these upwhich meant the S&amp;S Video division never took off. Simon &amp; Schuster launched its audiobook division in 1985. According to Korda, audiobooks were a major business for Simon &amp; Schuster by the 1990s.

In 1989, Gulf and Western Inc., owner of Simon &amp; Schuster, changed its name to Paramount Communications Inc.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Simon &amp; Schuster as the largest book publisher in the United States with sales of $1.3 billion the previous year. That same year, Simon &amp; Schuster acquired the children&#x27;s publisher Green Tiger Press.

In 1993, Simon &amp; Schuster bought Macmillan (including Scribner&#x27;s, Free Press, and Jossey-Bass), and changed its name to Paramount Publishing. Viacom then bought Paramount in 1994 and changed the name back to Simon &amp; Schuster. Macmillan was acquired for US$552.8 million. Later that year, Snyder was suddenly fired from S&amp;S and was replaced by the company&#x27;s president and chief operating officer Jonathan Newcomb. Simon &amp; Schuster then sold several peripheral assets, such as selling Charles E. Simon Co. to CDB Infotek. Gousha was sold to Rand McNally in 1996.

In 1994, S&amp;S acquired the software operations of Markt+Technik. Later that year, Simon &amp; Schuster (through Paramount) launched a software publisher in partnership with Davidson &amp; Associates named Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive. The studio published video games such as &quot;Outlaw Golf&quot;, &quot;Deer Avenger&quot;, &quot;I.M. Meen&quot;, &quot;Chill Manor&quot;, &quot;EVE Online&quot;, and games based on Richard Scarry&#x27;s characters. S&amp;S Interactive shut down in 2003.

In 1998, Viacom sold Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s educational operations (including Prentice Hall, Macmillan, and Jossey-Bass) to Pearson plc, the global publisher and then owner of Penguin and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;; Pearson then merged the operations with Addison-Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education. Later, Pearson sold several of the acquired S&amp;S divisions: first Appleton &amp; Lange was divested to McGraw-Hill and Master Data Central was sold to Master Data Center. Then, Jossey-Bass was sold to John Wiley &amp; Sons and the Bureau of Business Practice was sold to Wolters Kluwer. Subsequently, Macmillan Library Reference&#x27;s children&#x27;s imprints (Silver Burdett Press, Dillon Press, Crestwood House, Silver Press, New Discovery and Julian Messner) were closed. Then, Gale acquired Macmillan Library Reference (Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons Reference, Macmillan Reference, Thorndike Press, G.K. Hall, Twayne Publishers and Schirmer Books). Finally, IDG Books acquired Macmillan General Reference (including Frommer&#x27;s, J.K. Lasser, Betty Crocker Cookbooks, Weight Watchers Dieting and Cookbooks and Howell House Pet Books but excluding Complete Idiot&#x27;s Guides, which Pearson later transferred to Macmillan Computer Publishing under Alpha Books and currently part of Penguin Random House under Dorling Kindersley).

=== 2000s ===
In 2002, Simon &amp; Schuster acquired its Canadian distributor Distican. Simon &amp; Schuster began publishing in Canada in 2013.

At the end of 2005, Viacom split into two companies: CBS Corporation (which inherited S&amp;S and Paramount Parks), and the other retaining the Viacom name. Also in 2005, Simon &amp; Schuster acquired Strebor Books International, which was founded in 1999 by author Kristina Laferne Roberts, who has written under the pseudonym &quot;Zane&quot;. A year later, in 2006, Simon &amp; Schuster launched the conservative imprint Threshold Editions.

In 2009, Simon &amp; Schuster signed a multi-book and co-publishing deal with Glenn Beck which fell over many of its imprints and included adult non-fiction, fiction, children, and YA literature as well as e-book and audiobook originals. As part of CBS, Simon &amp; Schuster has been the primary publisher for books related to various media franchises owned by and/or aired on CBS such as . The company has also held a license to publish books in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise under Pocket Books.

=== 2010s ===
In 2011, Simon &amp; Schuster signed a number of co-publishing deals. Glenn Beck signed a new co-publishing deal with Simon &amp; Schuster for his own imprint, Mercury Ink. Under Atria, Simon &amp; Schuster also launched a publishing venture with Cash Money Records called Cash Money Content.

On April 11, 2012, the United States Department of Justice filed &quot;United States v. Apple Inc.&quot;, naming Apple, Simon &amp; Schuster, and four other major publishers as defendants. The suit alleged that they conspired to fix prices for e-books, and weaken Amazon.com&#x27;s position in the market, in violation of antitrust law.

Simon &amp; Schuster reorganized all of their imprints under four main groups in 2012. The four groups included the Atria Publishing Group, the Scribner Publishing Group, the Simon &amp; Schuster Publishing Group and the Gallery Publishing Group. According to CEO Carolyn Reidy, the divisions were created to align imprints that complement one another and that the structure would &quot;lead to a sharper editorial focus for our imprints even as it takes consideration of the natural affinities among them.&quot; In 2012, Simon &amp; Schuster launched a self-publishing arm of the company, Archway Publishing.

On November 14, 2013, Simon &amp; Schuster signed a co-publishing agreement with former New York Yankees shortstop, Derek Jeter, to launch Jeter Publishing. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which Simon &amp; Schuster and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing.

In 2014, Simon &amp; Schuster signed a partnership deal with Amazon over ebooks and also launched a new speculative fiction imprint. On October 21, 2014, Simon &amp; Schuster signed a multi-year partnership deal with Amazon.com in negotiations concerning the price of e-books. Simon &amp; Schuster also launched a new science fiction imprint called Simon451 that would publish titles across science fiction and fantasy with an emphasis on ebooks and online communities. The name of the imprint was inspired by Ray Bradbury&#x27;s book &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (the temperature at which books burn). Bradbury&#x27;s classic is also published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

Simon &amp; Schuster expanded beyond book publishing in 2015 by offering a new business model and additional services for authors. In 2015, Simon &amp; Schuster announced the creation of a new publishing unit and imprint called North Star Way. The imprint would publish non-fiction titles such as self-improvement, inspirational and mind-body-spirit titles. In addition, the group would also serve as a platform and set of services for authors that go beyond what a traditional book publisher offers to find their audience. The services include helping authors expand their reach through online courses, seminars, workshops, mobile applications, video and audiobooks, sponsorships and business partnerships, and podcasts. North Star Way sits within the Gallery Publishing Group division. According to Michele Martin, publisher and founder, the name North Star reflects their mission, &quot;to publish books that will help readers find the path to a better life, and to be a guide for our authors, not only through publication of their books but also in the many other activities that can help their message find the widest possible audience.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, Michele Martin expanded that North Star Way, &quot;aims to meet consumers where they are, in whatever form of media they consume. We expand the ideas in the books into a variety of platforms.&quot; The name prompted Marvel Comics to attempt to register the name of their superhero Northstar in February 2015. The application was denied as Simon &amp; Schuster had already made a trademark application for North Star Way in January.

Simon &amp; Schuster launched SimonSays.com a portal for online video courses in 2016, along with Scout Press, a new literary fiction imprint under Gallery Books Group. They also launched North Star Way, a platform-based program to provide authors with services beyond publishing including brand management, online courses, sponsorship, and business partnerships. Also as of 2016, Simon &amp; Schuster had more than 18k e-books available for sale and signed a deal to distribute Start Publishing LLC, a catalog of 7,000 e-book titles.

In 2019, CBS and Viacom reunited to form ViacomCBS. As a result, Simon &amp; Schuster became part of the newly formed ViacomCBS. Since February 15, 2022, ViacomCBS is known as Paramount Global.

=== 2020s ===
In March 2020, ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish announced the company&#x27;s intention to sell the Simon &amp; Schuster division, as it &quot;does not have significant connection for our broader business.&quot; Bakish expected the sale to close in 2020, a date that was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In September 2020, German media group Bertelsmann, which owns Penguin Random House, announced that it was interested in acquiring Simon &amp; Schuster. According to Bertelsmann chief executive and chairman Thomas Rabe, &quot;We&#x27;ve been the most active player on the consolidation of the book publishing market in the last 10 years. We combined Penguin and Random House very successfully to create by far the largest book publisher in the world, actually the only global book publisher. Given this position we would, of course, be interested in Simon &amp; Schuster.&quot;

Vivendi, which owns the French publisher Editis, and News Corp, which owns HarperCollins, were also named as contenders in acquiring Simon &amp; Schuster. ViacomCBS expected the bids to be placed before November 26, 2020.

On November 25, 2020, ViacomCBS announced it would sell Simon &amp; Schuster to Penguin Random House for $2.175 billion. The deal was expected to close in 2022, but was blocked by US federal judge Florence Y. Pan on October 31, 2022. An appeal to the court ruling was announced a day later by Bertelsmann, but it was ultimately canceled on November 21.

In 2021, Simon &amp; Schuster made book deals with former Trump administration officials, such as Vice President Mike Pence and Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway. This prompted protests among Simon &amp; Schuster staff. On November 2, 2021, the United States Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit to block Penguin Random House&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Simon &amp; Schuster. The lawsuit argues that the acquisition would create a publisher with too much influence over books and author payments. A federal judge sided with the plaintiff, leading Paramount to nullify the deal in November 2022.

In 2022, Simon &amp; Schuster employee Filippo Bernardini was arrested for the 2016–2021 literary phishing thefts. The company released a statement saying they were &quot;shocked and horrified to learn today of the allegations of fraud and identity theft by an employee.&quot;

In June 2023, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that HarperCollins and investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) had emerged as potential frontrunners for the company. On August 3, 2023, it was reported that KKR was in &quot;advanced talks&quot; with Paramount Global. On August 7, 2023, Paramount Global announced that it had agreed to sell Simon &amp; Schuster to KKR for $1.62 billion. The sale was completed on October 30, 2023.

In May 2024, Simon &amp; Schuster acquired Veen Bosch &amp; Keuning (VBK), the largest Dutch book publishing company. The acquisition includes all of VBK&#x27;s imprints in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as its sister companies, the audiobook producer Thinium, and Bookchoice, a subscription-based platform for e-books and audiobooks. This is the first expansion of Simon &amp; Schuster into a non-English market. In September 2024, it was announced that Simon &amp; Schuster Australia had entered an agreement to acquire publisher Affirm Press.

<text>The First of the Few (US title Spitfire) is a 1942 British black-and-white biographical film produced and directed by Leslie Howard, who stars as R. J. Mitchell, the designer of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft.

David Niven co-stars as a Royal Air Force officer and test pilot, a composite character that represents the pilots who flew Mitchell&#x27;s seaplanes and tested the Spitfire. The film depicts Mitchell&#x27;s strong work ethic in designing the Spitfire and his death. The film&#x27;s title alludes to Winston Churchill&#x27;s speech describing Battle of Britain aircrew, subsequently known as the Few: &quot;Never was so much owed by so many to so few&quot;.

The film premiered at the Leicester Square Theatre in London at 6.30pm on Thurs 30 August 1942, as a charity performance in aid of the RAF Benevolent Fund.

Leslie Howard&#x27;s portrayal of Mitchell has a special significance since Howard was killed when the Lisbon-to-London civilian airliner in which he was travelling was shot down by the Luftwaffe on 1 June 1943. His death occurred only days before &quot;The First of the Few&quot; was released in the United States on 12 June 1943, under the alternative title of &quot;Spitfire&quot;.

==Plot==
A newsreel sets the scene for summer 1940, showing Nazi advances in Europe with Britain facing invasion and aerial attacks on the island increasing. On 15 September 1940, during the Battle of Britain, RAF Squadron Leader Geoffrey Crisp, the station commander of a Spitfire squadron, recounts the story of how his friend R. J. Mitchell designed the Spitfire fighter.

His pilots listen as Crisp begins with the 1922 Schneider Trophy competition, where Mitchell began his most important work, designing high speed aircraft. While watching seagulls with his binoculars, he envisages a new shape for aircraft in the future. Crisp, an ex-First World War pilot seeking work, captivates Mitchell with his enthusiasm and the designer promises to hire him as test pilot should his design ever go into production. Facing opposition from official sources, Mitchell succeeds in creating a series of highly successful seaplane racers, eventually winning the Schneider Trophy outright for Great Britain.

After a visit to Germany in the 1930s, a chance meeting with leading German aircraft designer Willy Messerschmitt, and hearing talk of German re-armament, Mitchell resolves to build the fastest and deadliest fighter aircraft. Convincing Henry Royce of Rolls-Royce that a new engine, eventually to become the famous Merlin, is needed, Mitchell gets the powerplant he requires.

Faced by the devastating news that he has only one year to live and battling against failing health, Mitchell dies just after hearing word that the government has ordered the Spitfire into production. Crisp ends his account when the squadron is scrambled to counter a German attack. The Germans are beaten, with the Luftwaffe losing more planes than the British.

In the end, Crisp is relieved with victory and looks to the clouds to Mitchell, voicing a thanks to him for creating the Spitfire. A single aeroplane ascends towards the sun, followed later by three others.

Cast members are in order as listed by the British Film Institute.

==Production==

&quot;The First of the Few&quot; is a British film produced and directed by Leslie Howard, with Howard taking the starring role of aviation engineer and designer R. J. Mitchell. Leslie Howard bore little resemblance to R. J. Mitchell, however, as Mitchell was a large and athletic man. Howard portrayed Mitchell as upper class and mild-mannered. Mitchell – &quot;the Guv&#x27;nor&quot; – was in fact working class and had an explosive temper; apprentices were told to watch the colour of his neck and to run if it turned red. Howard himself was well aware of these deliberate artistic discrepancies, and dealt delicately with the family and Mitchell&#x27;s colleagues; Mrs. Mitchell and her son Gordon were on the set during much of the production. When told that the &quot;authorities&quot; had come up with the name &quot;Spitfire&quot;, Mitchell is reported to have said &quot;Just the sort of bloody silly name they would think of&quot;.

The film&#x27;s score was composed by William Walton, who later incorporated major cues into a concert work known as &quot;Spitfire Prelude and Fugue&quot;.

Because &quot;The First of the Few&quot; was made during the Second World War and dealt with subjects related to the conflict, it was, in effect, propaganda. Because of its value as propaganda, the RAF contributed Spitfire fighters for the production. U.S. producer Samuel Goldwyn allowed Niven to appear in exchange for U.S. rights to the film, which was distributed by RKO Pictures. After seeing the prints, Goldwyn was furious that Niven was cast in a secondary role and personally edited out 40 minutes before reissuing the film as &quot;Spitfire&quot;.

Wing Commander Bunny Currant (&quot;Hunter Leader&quot;) Squadron Leader Tony Bartley, Squadron Leader Brian Kingcome, Flying Officer David Fulford, Flight Lieutenant &#x27;Jock&#x27; Gillan, Squadron Leader P. J. Howard-Williams and Flight Lieutenant J. C. &#x27;Robbie&#x27; Robson are among the pilots and RAF Fighter Command personnel who make uncredited appearances. Some pilots seen in the early sequences did not survive to see the completed film. Jeffrey Quill is the test pilot who flies the Spitfire prototype in the scene demonstrating its ability to climb to 10,000 feet and dive at more than 500 miles per hour.

==Historical accuracy==

Geoffrey Crisp is a fictional character that is an amalgam of Vickers&#x27;s test pilots, Jeffrey Quill (also an RAF veteran) and &quot;Mutt&quot; Summers. Having one character personify the test pilots is a liberty that gives the story narrative coherence, as well as a narrator and occasional comic relief. The character embodies all those who gave Mitchell encouragement in the face of bureaucratic opposition. &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote, &quot;Oddly enough, since Mitchell was a real man and Crisp is merely a symposium of test pilots, an imaginary creation, it is Mitchell who seems the figment, Crisp the flesh-and-blood character. David Niven&#x27;s flippant assurance is just right here. The real-life story is the more real for his imagined presence; he gives the rather abstracted film a body.&quot;

Mitchell&#x27;s fatal illness is deliberately not specified in the film. Through dramatic licence, it is implied that a period of rest could have saved or at least extended his life. In fact, Mitchell had bowel or rectal cancer, which he battled for four years. In 1933 he underwent a colostomy and he was ill, often seriously ill, for the remainder of his life. Following surgery in February 1937 he spent a month at a clinic in Vienna, but his cancer was too advanced for the treatment to be effective. Mitchell returned home and, as in the film, spent his last conscious hours in his garden. He died on 11 June 1937, aged 42.

&quot;The First of the Few&quot; contains several historical inaccuracies:
* Mitchell did not work himself to death on the Spitfire. He did, however, continue to work despite the pain of his illness, tweaking and perfecting the Spitfire design up until his death.
* The famous Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was named after a bird of prey, following the Rolls-Royce convention adopted for its piston aircraft engine designs. It was not named after the wizard of Arthurian legend, as depicted in the film.
* It is believed that Mitchell visited Germany while convalescing from his 1933 surgery, but he never met aircraft designer Willy Messerschmitt.

The film contains historically significant footage that would otherwise have been lost to posterity:
* Film footage of the Supermarine S.4 taking off from Southampton Water, and in flight, now available nowhere else.
* Footage of many real-life Battle of Britain fighter pilots in the opening and closing scenes. RAF fighter pilots such as Tony Bartley and Brian Kingcome (with pipe) have cameo roles in the scenes at the dispersal, and are seen discussing their flights with David Niven before takeoff and after landing.
* Film footage of Jeffrey Quill flying a Spitfire Mk II in the final scenes of the film. Jeffrey Quill&#x27;s log book records that the aerobatic flying sequences featured in the last 20 minutes of the film were made by him from Northolt on 1–2 November 1941, in a Spitfire Mk II, flying for one hour, five minutes on 1 November and for 45 minutes on 2 November 1941.
* The workers seen building the Spitfire, near the end of the film. These are the real workers, filmed at the Hamble Supermarine Factory, one being Wilfred Hillier (wearing spectacles), working on the only left handed lathe, imported from Germany.

Leslie Howard&#x27;s portrayal of Mitchell has a special significance since Howard was killed when the BOAC Flight 777 Douglas DC-3 airliner in which he was a passenger was shot down by the Luftwaffe one year after the film was released.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The First of the Few&quot; was received well by audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; it was the most popular British film of 1942 in Britain.

===Critical===
&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that &quot;the film is full of action, Schneider Trophy races, test flying and flashes from the Battle of Britain with which, pointing its moral, it begins and ends.&quot; Niven was credited for &quot;one of his best performances up to now.&quot; S. P MacKenzie wrote of the film&#x27;s reception in Britain that &quot;virtually every section of the popular and trade press was bowled over by &quot;First of the Few&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Production, performances and story—they can&#x27;t miss,&quot; wrote &quot;Variety&quot; after an August 1942 screening in London. &quot;In interpreting the life of R. J. Mitchell, who designed the Spitfire plane, Leslie Howard&#x27;s work ranks among his finest performances. And it is an epic picture.&quot;

&quot;It was backed by the RAF and intended to inspire the nation at a time of crisis,&quot; wrote journalist and author Gerard Garrett. &quot;Films, or anything else, made with such intentions rarely survive their hour. But &quot;The First of the Few&quot;, though a trifle stolid to modern eyes, was an excellent example of how British film makers, provided with realistic subjects, rose to the challenge. Film critics like everyone else are not immune to events, but their respectful reception of this film seems in retrospect to have been fully merited.&quot;

When the film reached US screens in June 1943, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; pronounced it &quot;but a fair motion picture [with] moments of almost tedious restraint.&quot; But Crowther wrote that its most moving effect was the place it would hold as Howard&#x27;s last film. &quot;It was a truly uncanny coincidence that &quot;Spitfire&quot; should have opened here just a few days after it was reported that Leslie Howard, its star and producer, had been lost at sea. It was weird and justly poetic and the loss of Mr Howard was thereby brought more poignantly home because this film, which is a quiet memorial to the designer of the famous British plane, might suitably do the same service, in the eyes of Americans, to its star.&quot; Crowther continued:

For Mr Howard&#x27;s R. J. Mitchell in &quot;Spitfire&quot; is mostly Mr Howard—or the character he has often played in pictures and which we have often admired—the studious, retiring fellow of a certain melancholy turn of mind which was sweetened by a quiet sense of humor and a deep-rooted self-respect. … And now, to see him in &quot;Spitfire&quot; seems almost too relevant for chance. For Mr Howard&#x27;s parting as Mitchell is too much like his own exit into the blue. The final fadeout of the picture on planes winging toward the clouds is prophetic. … And if he had consciously designed it, he could not have given himself a more appropriate leave.

Among modern critics, Leslie Halliwell wrote that the film is a &quot;low-key but impressive biopic with firm acting and good dialogue scenes. Production values slightly shaky.&quot; AllMovie noted that the film &quot;gets the essentials correct, and is surprisingly suspenseful for a bio-pic of this type&quot;. Leonard Maltin gave the film three out of four stars, and called it a &quot;good biographical drama&quot;.

<text>Aircrew are personnel who operate an aircraft while in flight. The composition of a flight&#x27;s crew depends on the type of aircraft, plus the flight&#x27;s duration and purpose.

== Commercial aviation ==

=== Flight deck positions ===
In commercial aviation, the crew responsible for operating and controlling the aircraft are called &quot;flight crew&quot;. Some flight crew position names are derived from nautical terms and indicate a rank or command structure similar to that on ocean-going vessels, allowing for quick executive decision making during normal operations or emergency situations. Historical flightdeck positions include:

* Captain, the pilot Pilot-in-Command and highest-ranking member or members of a flight crew.
* First officer (FO, also called a co-pilot), another pilot who is normally seated to the right of the captain. (On helicopters, an FO is normally seated to the left of the captain, who occupies the right-hand seat.)
* Second officer (SO), a person lower in rank to the first officer, and who typically performs selected duties and also acts as a relief pilot. The rank of second officer was traditionally a flight engineer, who was often the person who handled the engine controls. In the 21st century, second officers on some airlines are pilots who act as &quot;cruise relief&quot; on long haul flights.
* Third officer (TO), a person lower in rank to a second officer, and who typically performs selected duties and can also act as a relief pilot. Largely redundant in the present day. 
* &#x27;Relief Crew&#x27; members in the present day are fully licensed and trained captains and first officers who accompany long-haul airline flights, and who relieve the primary pilots during designated times from the commercial operator or consented portions between the two crews to provide them with the opportunities for rest or sleep breaks to avoid the risk of pilot fatigue (some large wide-body airliners are equipped with special pilot sleeper berths, but more typically reserved seats in the section closest to the flight deck, or cockpit, are used for the relief crew). A relief crew will take over most predominantly during the middle portions of a flight when an aircraft is usually on autopilot and at cruising altitude. The number of relief crew members assigned to a flight depends in part on the length of the flight and the official air regulations the airline operates under.
* Flight Engineer (FE), a position originally called an &#x27;Air Mechanic&#x27;. On older aircraft, typically between the late-1920s and the 1970s, the flight engineer was the crew member responsible for engines, systems and fuel management. As aircraft became increasingly sophisticated and automated, this function has been mostly assumed by the primary pilots (Captain and FO), resulting in a continued downsizing in the number of aircrew positions on commercial flights. The flight engineer&#x27;s position is commonly staffed as a second officer. Flight engineers can still be found in the present day (in greatly diminished numbers), used on airline or air freight operations still flying such older aircraft. The position is typically crewed by a dual-licensed Pilot-Flight Engineer in the present day.
* Airborne Sensor Operator, An airborne sensor operator (aerial sensor operator, ASO, Aerial Remote Sensing Data Acquisition Specialist, Aerial Payload Operator, Police Tactical Flight Officer, Tactical Coordinator etc.) is the functional profession of gathering information from an airborne platform (Manned or Unmanned) and/or oversee mission management systems for academic, commercial, public safety or military remote sensing purposes. The airborne sensor operator is considered a principal flight crew or aircrew member.
* Navigator (archaic), also called &#x27;Air Navigators&#x27; or &#x27;Flight Navigators&#x27;. A position on older aircraft, typically between the late-1910s and the 1970s, where separate crew members (sometimes two navigation crew members) were often responsible for the flight navigation, including its dead reckoning and celestial navigation, especially when flown over oceans or other featureless areas where radio navigation aids were not originally available. As sophisticated electronic air navigation aids and universal space-based GPS navigation systems came online, the dedicated Navigator&#x27;s position was discontinued and its function was assumed by dual-licensed Pilot-Navigators, and still later by the aircraft&#x27;s primary pilots (Captain and FO), resulting in a continued downsizing in the number of aircrew positions on commercial flights. Modern electronic navigation systems made the navigator redundant by the early 1980s.
* Radio Operator (archaic). A position on much older aircraft, typically between the mid-1910s and the 1940s, where a separate crew member was often responsible for handling telegraphic and voice radio communications between the aircraft and ground stations. As radio sets became increasingly sophisticated and easier to operate, the function was taken over directly by a FO or SO, and still later by the pilot-in-command and co-pilot, making the radio operator&#x27;s position redundant.

=== Cabin positions ===
Aircraft cabin crew members can consist of:
* Purser or &quot;In-flight Service Manager or Cabin Services Director&quot;, is responsible for the cabin crew as a team leader. 
* Flight attendant or &quot;Cabin Crew&quot;, is the crew member responsible for the safety of passengers. Historically during the early era of commercial aviation, the position was staffed by young &#x27;cabin boys&#x27; who assisted passengers. Cabin boys were replaced by female nurses, originally called &#x27;stewardesses&#x27;. The medical background requirement for the flight attendant position was later dropped.
* Flight medic, is a specialized paramedic employed on air ambulance aircraft or flights.
* Loadmaster, is a crew member on a cargo aircraft with cargo ramp (which is used for loading and unloading cargo to and from the aircraft) responsible for loading freight and personnel, and for calculating the aircraft&#x27;s weight and balance prior to flight, which must be within the aircraft manufacturer&#x27;s prescribed limits, for safe flight. On non-cargo aircraft, weight and balance tasks are performed by the flight crew or ground handling personnel.

== Military ==
From the start of military aviation, additional crew members have flown on military aircraft. Over time these duties have expanded:
* Pilot 
* Co-pilot 
* Air gunner, crew member responsible for the operation of defensive weapons, for example gun turrets. Specific positions include nose gunner, door gunner and tail gunner
* Bombardier or Bomb Aimer is a crew member for the release of ordnance, particularly bombs.
* Boom operator, an aircrew member on tanker aircraft responsible for operating the flying boom and the transfer of fuel.
* Combat systems officer
* Airborne Mission Systems Specialist, an aircrew member who operates some form of electronic or other type equipment such as computers, radars, or intelligence gathering equipment to assist or complete the aircraft&#x27;s mission.
* Airborne Sensor Operator, An airborne sensor operator (Aerial Sensor Operator, Tactical Coordinator, EWO etc.) is the functional profession of gathering information from an airborne platform (Manned or Unmanned) and/or oversee mission management systems for tactical, operational and strategic remote sensing purposes.
* Crew chief, an enlisted aircraft mechanic with many various responsibilities. Primary among those are aircraft maintenance, pre-flight/postflight inspections, passenger management, acting as a doorgunner, in-air fire fighting, airspace surveillance, assisting the pilots to land the aircraft in difficult landing zones, assisting pilots with engine start up and shutdown safety, fuel checks, monitoring &quot;hot&quot; refuels (refueling with engines running).
* Flight attendant, a crew member who tends to passengers on military aircraft. This position is similar to the duties performed by commercial flight attendants.
* Flight engineer, a crew member responsible for engines, systems and fuel management.
* Flight officer 
* Flight surgeon or flight nurse, aerial medical staff not involved in the operation of the aircraft but is considered by some militaries to be aircrew. 
* Loadmaster, crew member responsible for loading freight and personnel and the weight and balance of the aircraft.
* Navigator, a crew member responsible for air navigation. Still actively trained and licensed in some present day militaries, as electronic navigation aids can not be assumed to be operational during warfare. 
* Air observer
* Radar intercept officer
* Rescue swimmer on air-sea rescue aircraft
* Air Signaller or radio operator, crew member responsible for the operation of the aircraft communications systems.
* Tactical coordinator (TACCO), Weapon System Officer on board a Maritime Patrol Aircraft.
* Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) Commissioned Aircrew Officer Weapons or Mission System Specialist.
* Weapon Systems Operator (WSOp), as above but Enlisted.

<doc id="1001908" wikidata="Q5272550" url="?curid=1001908" title="Dichromatism">
<text>Dichromatism (or polychromatism) is a phenomenon where a material or solution&#x27;s hue is dependent on both the concentration of the absorbing substance and the depth or thickness of the medium traversed. In most substances which are not dichromatic, only the brightness and saturation of the colour depend on their concentration and layer thickness.
Examples of dichromatic substances are pumpkin seed oil, bromophenol blue, and resazurin.
When the layer of pumpkin seed oil is less than 0.7 mm thick, the oil appears bright green, and in layer thicker than this, it appears bright red.

The phenomenon is related to both the physical chemistry properties of the substance and the physiological response of the human visual system to colour. This combined physicochemical–physiological basis was first explained in 2007.

In gemstones, dichromatism is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Usambara effect&#x27;.

==Physical explanation==
Dichromatic properties can be explained by the Beer–Lambert law and by the excitation characteristics of the three types of cone photoreceptors in the human retina. Dichromatism is potentially observable in any substance that has an absorption spectrum with one wide but shallow local minimum and one narrow but deep local minimum. The apparent width of the deep minimum may also be limited by the end of the visible range of human eye; in this case, the true full width may not necessarily be narrow. As the thickness of the substance increases, the perceived hue changes from that defined by the position of the wide-but-shallow minimum (in thin layers) to the hue of the deep-but-narrow minimum (in thick layers).

The absorbance spectrum of pumpkin seed oil has the wide-but-shallow minimum in the green region of the spectrum and deep local minimum in the red region. In thin layers, the absorption at any specific green wavelength is not as low as it is for the red minimum, but a broader band of greenish wavelengths are transmitted, and hence the overall appearance is green. The effect is enhanced by the greater sensitivity to green of the photoreceptors in the human eye, and the narrowing of the red transmittance band by the long-wavelength limit of cone photoreceptor sensitivity.
According to the Beer–Lambert law, when viewing through the coloured substance (and thus ignoring reflection), the proportion of light transmitted at a given wavelength, &quot;T&quot;, decreases exponentially with thickness &quot;t&quot;, T = e−&quot;at&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; is the absorbance at that wavelength. Let &quot;G&quot; = e−&quot;a&quot;G&quot;t&quot; be the green transmittance and &quot;R&quot; = e−&quot;a&quot;R&quot;t&quot; be the red transmittance. The ratio of the two transmitted intensities is then (&quot;G&quot;/&quot;R&quot;) = e(&quot;a&quot;R-&quot;a&quot;G)&quot;t&quot;. If the red absorbance is less than the green, then as the thickness &quot;t&quot; increases, so does the ratio of red to green transmitted light, which causes the apparent hue of the colour to switch from green to red.

==Quantification==
The extent of dichromatism of material can be quantified by the Kreft&#x27;s dichromaticity index (DI). It is defined as the difference in hue angle (Δhab) between the colour of the sample at the dilution, where the chroma (colour saturation) is maximal and the colour of four times more diluted (or thinner) and four times more concentrated (or thicker) sample. The two hue angle differences are called dichromaticity index towards lighter (Kreft&#x27;s DIL) and
dichromaticity index towards darker (Kreft&#x27;s DID) respectively. Kreft&#x27;s dichromaticity index DIL and DID for pumpkin oil, which is one of the most dichromatic substances, are −9 and −44, respectively. This means that pumpkin oil changes its colour from green-yellow to orange-red (for 44 degrees in Lab colour space) when the thickness of the observed layer is increased from cca 0.5 mm to 2 mm; and it changes slightly towards green (for 9 degrees) if its thickness is reduced for 4-fold.

==History==
A record by William Herschel (1738–1822), shows he observed dichromatism with a solution of ferrous sulphate and tincture of nutgall in 1801 when working on an early solar telescope, but he did not recognise the effect.

<doc id="1001910" wikidata="Q1076991" url="?curid=1001910" title="Chris Bell (politician)">
<text>Robert Christopher Bell (born November 23, 1959) is an American politician, attorney, and former journalist. He is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin and South Texas College of Law. Bell served five years on the Houston City Council from 1997 to 2001, followed by one term in the United States House of Representatives from Texas&#x27;s 25th Congressional District in Houston from 2003 to 2005.

Bell then became the Democratic nominee in the 2006 election for the office of Governor of Texas, losing to Republican incumbent governor Rick Perry by 406,450 votes (Perry 39% versus Bell 30%) in a fractured general election campaign that also drew in two significant independent challengers. Bell, a member of the Democratic Party, is currently an attorney specializing in personal injury and commercial litigation. Prior to practicing law, Bell had been a prominent radio journalist in Texas.

==Personal history==
Chris Bell was born in Abilene, the seat of Taylor County in West Texas. He was reared in Dallas and moved to Austin when he was accepted to the University of Texas at Austin. As a student, Bell was a member of Phi Delta Theta, and served as president of the Interfraternity Council, and also spearheaded a successful effort to reinstate student government. In 1982, he graduated with a journalism degree and began work as a television and radio journalist, first in Ardmore, Oklahoma and later in Amarillo. He then moved to Houston, working as a Harris County court radio reporter while taking night classes at South Texas College of Law.

Despite his success in journalism (he was named “best radio reporter in the state” in 1990 by the Texas Associated Press), he left journalism and began what would become a successful litigation practice after receiving his J.D. degree and being licensed as an attorney in Texas in 1992. Bell&#x27;s public service career began in 1997, after being elected to the Houston City Council. After his campaign for State Senate in 2008, Bell returned to the private practice of law.

He currently lives in the Heights area of Houston.

==Political career==

===Texas House of Representatives campaign (1984)===

In 1984, Bell ran for Amarillo-based District 87 for the Texas House of Representatives after friends assured him they could get him a job as a legal assistant if he won. Bell was defeated by a large margin by incumbent Charles J. &quot;Chip&quot; Staniswalis.

===Houston City Council (1997–2002)===
Bell ran for Houston City Council in 1995. He received third place, behind David Ballard and eventual winner Orlando Sanchez.

He ran again in a 1997 special election, called to fill the seat vacated by the resignation of John Peavy. He placed second in the election after African American minister James W.E. Dixon II. However, since no candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote, the election went to a runoff. Bell defeated Dixon by 6,000 votes.

Bell served as at large Position 4 councilman for the Houston City Council for five years. During this time, he served as chairman of both the Council Committee on Customer Service and Initiatives and the Ethics Committee. Throughout his service, he focused on ethics reform, passing laws that limited the use of soft money in city elections. He also championed what he called “customer-driven government,” featuring innovative ideas to make government more accessible to the public. He also helped pass the largest tax cut in the city&#x27;s history and worked to pass sweeping ethics reform that significantly cleaned up what was a corrupt local government.

===Mayoral campaign (2001)===
In 2001, Bell ran against incumbent mayor Lee P. Brown. Brown and Bell&#x27;s first disagreement was previously in 2000, when Bell joined with conservatives to pass a 2-cent property tax rollback, causing Brown to replace Bell as chairman. Bell finished third behind Brown and Republican candidate Orlando Sanchez. Bell and Mayor Brown reconciled after the election — Bell endorsed Brown during the resulting runoff election and Brown was a vocal supporter for Bell&#x27;s 2002 congressional bid.

===U.S. Congress (2003–2005)===

In 2002, Bell successfully ran for the United States House of Representatives for Texas District 25. He represented most of southwestern Houston, including most of the city&#x27;s share of Fort Bend County. He was made assistant whip by House Democratic whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland. Bell also served on four standing committees, and was responsible for founding the Port Security Caucus, a group dedicated to improving seaport security.

In October 2003, Bell became a target in U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay’s 2003 congressional redistricting effort. One proposal would have thrown Bell into the heavily Republican 7th District of John Culberson. The final plan was somewhat less ambitious, but still put Bell in political jeopardy. His 25th District was renumbered as the 9th District, and absorbed a larger number of blacks and Latinos than he had previously represented. The old 25th was approximately 65 percent white; the new 9th was only 17 percent white. On March 9, 2004, Bell was handily defeated in the Democratic primary for District 9 by Al Green, the former president of the Houston NAACP, with Bell receiving only 31 percent of the vote.
Three months after losing his primary election, on June 15, 2004, Bell filed an ethics complaint against DeLay, alleging abuse of power and illegal solicitation of money, among other things. Bell&#x27;s charges ended a seven-year &quot;truce&quot; on such official accusations between the parties. Four months later, the House Ethics Committee unanimously &quot;admonished&quot; DeLay – a disciplinary measure less harsh than (in increasing order of severity) a fine, reprimand, censure, or expulsion – on two of Bell&#x27;s charges.

In response to Bell&#x27;s first complaint, it was found that &quot;(1) neither Representative DeLay nor anyone acting on his behalf improperly solicited contributions from [the energy company] Westar, and (2) Representative DeLay took no action with regard to Westar that would constitute an impermissible special favor&quot;; but that DeLay&#x27;s involvement in a Westar fundraiser was &quot;objectionable&quot; in that it raised &quot;an appearance of impropriety under House standards.&quot;

Bell&#x27;s second complaint was &quot;resolved by a letter of admonition&quot; indicating that &quot;the contacts of Representative DeLay’s staff with the Federal Aviation Administration&quot; (regarding absentee Texas legislators) raised &quot;serious concerns ... under House standards of conduct that preclude using governmental resources for a political undertaking.&quot;

The committee ultimately concluded that, for these two of Bell&#x27;s three complaints, &quot;formal investigation&quot; was &quot;not warranted.&quot; Bell&#x27;s third complaint, alleging &quot;violation of provisions of the Texas election code,&quot; was deferred by the committee for investigation by authorities in the state of Texas.

In 2005, after two unsuccessful attempts, Democratic district attorney Ronnie Earle obtained an indictment from a Travis County grand jury against DeLay on criminal charges that he had violated state campaign-finance laws. The indictments effectively ended DeLay&#x27;s political career; he resigned from office the following year. Tried by an Austin jury, DeLay was convicted in November 2010 on two charges of conspiracy and money laundering. On September 19, 2013, the Texas Court of Appeals for the Third District overturned both convictions and entered an acquittal for DeLay. Subsequently, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state&#x27;s highest criminal court, affirmed the district court&#x27;s reversal of the jury verdict in an 8–1 ruling, concluding that &quot;what prosecutors proved in DeLay&#x27;s case did not constitute either offense.&quot; DeLay termed his decade-long legal ordeal, originally instigated by Bell&#x27;s complaints, &quot;an outrageous criminalization of politics,&quot; and indicated that said he would &quot;probably not&quot; seek any return to elected office.

===Gubernatorial campaign (2006)===
Bell was the Democratic candidate in the 2006 election for the office of Governor of Texas. He ran against Republican incumbent Rick Perry and independents Carole Strayhorn and Kinky Friedman. Bell ultimately received 1,310,353 votes, or 29.79%, in the four-way race. Following the loss, Chris Bell and the political action committee (PAC) &quot;Clean Government Advocates for Chris Bell&quot; sued Gov. Perry and the Republican Governors Association, claiming they illegally hid $1 million in donations from Houston homebuilder Bob Perry (no relation to the governor) in the final days of the 2006 gubernatorial campaign.

Rick Perry chose to settle his part of the lawsuit out of court, but the Republican Governors Association did not. An initial court ruling in 2010 (by Travis County judge John Dietz) favored Bell, but that verdict was subsequently reversed on appeal in 2013, and the appellate court panel sent the case back to District Court to determine how much Bell should reimburse the governors association for associated legal fees.

===State Senate District 17 campaign (2008)===
On July 18, 2008, Bell announced on his campaign website that he would run in the special election for Texas Senate, District 17. The election was made necessary by the resignation of Republican senator Kyle Janek. While Bell emerged with a plurality in the November 4, 2008 election, he did not garner enough votes to avoid a special election runoff with Republican Joan Huffman, a former judge and prosecutor.
Despite heavy support from Democratic volunteers and officials, he ultimately lost the runoff to Huffman on December 16 with 43.7 percent of the vote to Huffman&#x27;s 56.3 percent.

===Mayoral campaign (2015)===

Bell ran for Houston Mayor in 2015 but finished fifth during the general elections. Bell then endorsed Bill King, raising eyebrows. Bell had received only 7 percent of the general vote, concentrated in the district C precincts. It was not dispersed throughout the entire city.

=== Senate campaign (2020) ===

Bell ran for Senate in Texas in the 2020 election. He lost the March 2020 Democratic primary, coming in sixth place with 8.5% of the vote and failing to advance to the runoff. Bell finished behind former congressional candidate M.J. Hegar, State Senator Royce West, labor organizer Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, businesswoman Annie &quot;Mamá&quot; Garcia, and Houston City Councilor Amanda Edwards.

==Issues and positions==

===Abortion===
Bell voted no on banning partial birth abortion except to save the mother&#x27;s life and had a 100 percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America.

===Immigration===
Bell supports the use of United States National Guard troops along the U.S.-Mexico border, &quot;as long as we are very careful not to turn the border into a militarized zone.&quot; He also supports the McCain-Kennedy bill that would provide a so-called &quot;pathway&quot; to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants already in the country, provided they had jobs, learned English, paid fines and met certain other requirements. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see anybody cutting in line, but I do think that people should be able to earn their citizenship if they&#x27;re productive and law-abiding citizens.&quot;

===Education===
Bell supports increased spending for the Texas public education system. He wants to focus on acquiring and retaining quality teachers, stopping textbook censorship, and taking the focus away from standardized tests like Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS). He wants to create a bipartisan committee on public education and give school districts more local control. Finally, he wants to make Texas higher education affordable. He wants to end the tuition deregulation which caused a 23% average increase in tuition at Texas state schools. He also wants to give public universities state funding and help students by making textbooks tax free.

===Gay rights===
Bell is a lifelong proponent of gay rights. In 2002, the Houston Chapter of the Human Rights Campaign awarded him with their first ever John Walzel Political Equality Award. He cosponsored the Permanent Partners Immigration Act with Houston Congress member Sheila Jackson-Lee. The bill sought to offer residency to immigrant same-sex partners of U.S. citizens, much as citizens of other countries who marry Americans are allowed to stay in the country.

===Healthcare===
Bell is a passionate supporter of stem cell research. After losing his mother to Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and nearly losing his wife to cancer, he believes that using science to cure disease is a moral imperative. Bell is on the board of StemPAC, a leading stem cell advocacy group, and often speaks at national stem cell conferences. While a member of the 108th United States Congress, he consistently voted pro stem cell research. Bell is also a strong proponent of the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a program that has been the target of budget cuts by Governor Rick Perry.

===Trans-Texas Corridor===
Bell has opposed the Trans-Texas Corridor, a proposed toll road, on the grounds that it would consume 1.5 million acres (6000 km²) of farmland and of privately owned property.

<doc id="1001915" wikidata="Q5105876" url="?curid=1001915" title="Chris Bell (American musician)">
<text>Christopher Branford Bell (January 12, 1951December 27, 1978) was an American musician and singer-songwriter. Along with Alex Chilton, he led the power pop band Big Star through its first album &quot;#1 Record&quot; (1972). He also pursued a solo career throughout the mid-1970s, resulting in the posthumous &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; LP.

AllMusic Guide praised Bell as &quot;one of the unsung heroes of American pop music&quot; and noted his lasting impression, saying: &quot;Despite a life marked by tragedy and a career crippled by commercial indifference, the singer/songwriter&#x27;s slim body of recorded work proved massively influential on the generations of indie rockers who emerged in his wake.&quot;

Bell&#x27;s catalog of proto-alternative rock has inspired the likes of Elliott Smith, Beck, R.E.M., Teenage Fanclub, Pixies, Primal Scream, Afghan Whigs, Pete Yorn, Wilco, The Posies, and The Replacements, all of whom have covered his music or expressed their admiration for Big Star in the press.

His life was documented in the acclaimed documentary &quot;Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me&quot;, released in 2013 by Magnolia Pictures.

Bell&#x27;s life, and the career of Big Star, was documented in the 2018 book &quot;There Was a Light: The Cosmic History of Chris Bell and the Rise of Big Star&quot;. The 400-page oral-history style bio contains rare interviews with Bell, his bandmates, friends, family and notable fans.

==Early career==
Before his more famous work in the 1970s with Alex Chilton, Bell played in a number of Memphis garage bands beginning in the 1960s. He had started playing music at age 12, influenced heavily by The Beatles and other British Invasion groups like The Yardbirds and The Who. One of Bell&#x27;s early groups included Memphis natives Richard Rosebrough and Terry Manning, with whom he continued to work for the rest of his music career.

In 1964 and 1965, Bell played lead guitar in a British Invasion-influenced group called the Jynx (the name being a pun on The Kinks) with local musicians, including lead vocalist Mike Harris, rhythm guitarist David Hoback, drummer DeWitt Shy, and bassist Bill Cunningham, and later, bassist Leo Goff. Other lead vocalists at some of the group&#x27;s shows and rehearsals (though not present on their recordings) included local teens Ames Yates, Vance Alexander, and Alex Chilton. Chilton, who attended many Jynx shows and sang lead vocals at a couple of gigs, soon joined the Box Tops with Cunningham, as the Jynx split up in 1966. Bell continued to perform and record in Memphis throughout the rest of the decade, including a stint in the heavier psych-rock band Christmas Future with Terry Manning and Steve Rhea. By the late 1960s, after attending UT in Knoxville, he had turned his focus toward writing original songs, and Manning brought Bell into the studio for his first professional recordings as a session guitarist.

==Big Star==
The group later known as Big Star stemmed from two Bell band projects that began in the late 1960s while he recorded and performed live in groups named Icewater and Rock City. These groups featured a revolving set of musicians including Jody Stephens, Terry Manning, Tom Eubanks, Andy Hummel, Richard Rosebrough, Vance Alexander, and Steve Rhea. Recordings by these groups appear on the various artists collection &quot;Rockin&#x27; Memphis 1960&#x27;s–1970&#x27;s Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Rock City&quot; (2003), and &quot;Looking Forward: The Roots of Big Star&quot; (2017).

Bell asked Chilton to join several months after the group had started performing. Eventually, during a period of recording demos and tracks for their first album, the group settled on the name &#x27;Big Star&#x27;. The lineup for Big Star&#x27;s first album was composed of Bell (guitars, vocals), Chilton (guitars, vocals), Hummel (bass, vocals), and Stephens (drums, vocals). Bell and Chilton wrote most of the group&#x27;s songs, with occasional writing contributions from Hummel and Stephens. Manning played the keyboards and several session horn players were employed. Bell was even more influenced by the music of the British Invasion than Chilton, and he steadfastly retained his Beatles-oriented pop influences throughout his career.

Along with Ardent Studios founder John Fry and engineer Terry Manning, Bell is credited with much of the mixing and engineering work done on the first Big Star album &quot;#1 Record&quot;. After this album failed to achieve commercial success (partially due to confusion by its soul-oriented distributor Stax in marketing the album), Bell left the band in 1972. He struggled with depression for the rest of his life. He also had problems with alcohol and other drugs while also becoming immersed in Christianity. According to his brother David, Bell may have left Big Star due to a belief that he was overshadowed by the more famous Chilton.

==Solo work==
Bell concentrated on solo work after leaving Big Star, recording demos at Ardent Studios and Shoe Recording in Memphis with old friends including Rosebrough, Manning, Cunningham, Ken Woodley, and occasionally Chilton and Jim Dickinson. One of Bell&#x27;s better known solo songs from this period is &quot;You and Your Sister&quot;, featuring Bell&#x27;s guitar work and vocals, Chilton&#x27;s backing vocal, and Cunningham&#x27;s string arrangements and bass work. From 1975 to 1976, Bell co-produced recording sessions for the power pop group Prix, and contributed guitar and backing vocals. Bell also played in groups with local songwriter Keith Sykes, as well as the Baker Street Regulars with Van Duren and Jody Stephens in 1976.

During the late 1970s, a few of Bell&#x27;s pop song lyrics began to reflect the influence of his interest in Christian spirituality. Although he released &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; backed with &quot;You and Your Sister&quot; as a single in 1978 on Chris Stamey&#x27;s Car Records label, none of his solo material was released on a full-length album during his lifetime. At this time, Bell worked at his father&#x27;s restaurant and continued to grapple with clinical depression.

Almost 14 years after his death, the songs from his Car Records single and several of his other 1970s recordings were released on 1992&#x27;s &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; full-length CD on Rykodisc. As with his work with Big Star, the album received highly favorable critical reviews. Giving the album an &quot;A−&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that it was &quot;clear from Bell&#x27;s very posthumous solo album . . . that Big Star was his idea.&quot;

In 2009, &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; was re-released in as a deluxe two-CD version by Rhino Handmade with lengthy liner notes, alternate versions, and additional tracks.

==Personal life==
Bell was an amateur photographer in his earlier career, especially in the late 1960s. He has been described as &#x27;quite accomplished&#x27;, and made his own prints in the style of Jimi Hendrix album covers.

According to Rob Jovanovic, Bell struggled throughout his life with repressed sexual attraction to other men and internalized homophobia. In later life he turned to born-again Christianity in an attempt to deal with his difficult relationship with his own sexuality, his friends reporting he was &quot;determined not to be gay&quot;.

Bell dealt with suicidal ideation and suicidal tendencies at times during his life, expressing in the song &#x27;Better Save Yourself&#x27; that he had attempted suicide twice.

==Death==
Bell died on December 27, 1978, when he lost control of his Triumph TR7 sports car, sometime after 1:00a.m. He was on his way home from a band rehearsal. The car struck a wooden light pole on the side of the road. The pole fell and killed him instantly. He was 27. His funeral was held the next day.

Chris Bell is buried at Memphis Funeral Home and Memorial Gardens in Bartlett, Tennessee.

==Influence==
Bell&#x27;s music and that of Big Star became popular with alternative rock musicians in the 1980s through word of mouth. Eventually, well-known artists including R.E.M., Ian Moore, Teenage Fanclub, and The Replacements began touting the recordings of Big Star as significant works. This Mortal Coil, which had earlier recorded versions of post-Chris Bell Big Star songs, recorded versions of &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; and &quot;You and Your Sister&quot; on their 1991 album &quot;Blood&quot;. In 1992, The Posies released a 7&quot; single featuring &quot;Feel&quot;/&quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; on Pop Llama.

Big Star&#x27;s pop song &quot;In the Street&quot;, which had featured the tight harmonies of Bell and Chilton, was chosen as a representative song of the 1970s decade by the producers of the television show &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; in 1998; though the Big Star recording of the song was never featured, two different covers of the song were used over the series&#x27; run as the theme song to the opening credits. The second, recorded by Cheap Trick in 1999, with revised lyrics, was also included on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show Presents That &#x27;70s Album: Rockin&#x27;.&quot;

Later, Bell&#x27;s song &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; appeared on the Flaming Lips album &quot;Late Night Tales: The Flaming Lips&quot;. Bell&#x27;s version of &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; is heard over the opening credits to the film &quot;Nick and Norah&#x27;s Infinite Playlist&quot;. Beck covers &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; in concert. Bell&#x27;s song &quot;There Was a Light&quot; was used in the soundtrack to the Patriot (TV series) 2018 episode &quot;Loaded.&quot;

<doc id="1001916" wikidata="Q773274" url="?curid=1001916" title="N-Methylethanolamine">
<text>&quot;N&quot;-Methylethanolamine is an alkanolamine with the formula CH3NHCH2CH2OH. It is flammable, corrosive, colorless, viscous liquid. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of choline.

With both an amine and a hydroxyl functional groups, it is a useful intermediate in the chemical synthesis of various products including polymers and pharmaceuticals. It is also used as a solvent, for example in the processing of natural gas, where it is used together with its analogs ethanolamine and dimethylethanolamine.

== Production ==
&quot;N&quot;-Methylethanolamine is produced industrially by reacting ethylene oxide with excess methylamine in aqueous solution. This reaction yields a mixture of the 1:1 addition product NMEA (1) and - by a further addition of another ethylene oxide - the 1:2 addition product methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) (2):

In order to obtain high yields of the desired target product, the reactants are continuously fed to a flow reactor and reacted with a more than two-fold excess of methylamine. In the downstream process steps, the excess methylamine and the water is removed and NMEA (bp. 160 °C) and MDEA (bp. 243 °C) are isolated from the product mixture by fractional distillation. The poly(methyl-ethanolamine) formed by further addition of ethylene oxide to methylethanolamine remains in the distillation bottoms.

== Properties ==
&quot;N&quot;-Methylethanolamine is a clear, colorless, hygroscopic, amine-like smelling liquid which is miscible with water and ethanol in any ratio. Aqueous solutions react strongly basic and are therefore corrosive. The substance is easily biodegradable and has no potential of bioaccumulation due to its water miscibility. NMEA is not mutagenic, but in the presence of nitrite, carcinogenic nitrosamines can be formed from the compound, as it is a secondary amine.

== Use ==
Like other alkylalkanolamines, &quot;N&quot;-methylethanolamine is used in water- and solvent-based paints and coatings as a solubilizer for other components, such as pigments and as a stabilizer.

In cathodic dip-coating, &quot;N&quot;-methylaminoethanol serves as cation neutralizer for the partial neutralization of the epoxy resin. It also serves as a chain extender in the reaction of high molecular weight polyepoxides with polyols.

Being a base, &quot;N&quot;-methylaminoethanol forms neutral salts with fatty acids, which are used as surfactants (soaps) with good emulsifying properties and find applications in textile and personal care cleansing products. When bleaching cotton-polyester blends, NMEA is used as a brightener.

By methylation of &quot;N&quot;-methylaminoethanol, dimethylaminoethanol and choline [(2-hydroxyethyl)-trimethyl-ammonium chloride] can be prepared.

In the reaction of &quot;N&quot;-methylaminoethanol with fatty acids, long-chain &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-(2-hydroxyethyl)amides are formed upon elimination of water. These are used as neutral surfactants. Such amides also act as flow improvers and pour point depressants in heavy oils and middle distillates.
By catalytic oxidation of &quot;N&quot;-methylaminoethanol, the non-proteinogenic amino acid sarcosine is obtained.

&quot;N&quot;-methylaminoethanol plays a role as a building block for the synthesis of crop protection compounds and pharmaceuticals, such as in the first stage of the reaction sequence to the antihistamine and antidepressant mianserin (Tolvin) and to the non-analgesic Nefopam (Ajan).

In analogy to other aziridines, &quot;N&quot;-methylaziridine can be obtained by a Wenker synthesis from &quot;N&quot;-methylaminoethanol. This is done either via the sulfuric acid ester or after replacement of the hydroxy group by a chlorine atom (for example by thionyl chloride or chlorosulfuric acid) to &quot;N&quot;-methyl-2-chloroethylamine and then by using a strong base (cleavage of HCl) in an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution:

It reacts with carbon disulfide to give &quot;N&quot;-methyl-2-thiazolidinethione.

<doc id="1001917" wikidata="Q3605083" url="?curid=1001917" title="Ground crew">
<text>In all forms of aviation, ground crew (also known as ground operations in civilian aviation) are personnel that service aircraft while on the ground, during routine turn-around; as opposed to aircrew, who operate all aspects of an aircraft whilst in flight. The term ground crew is used by both civilian commercial airlines and in military aviation.

==Aircraft ground crew==
Dependent on the type of aircraft being operated, airline ground crew members typically include: airframe technicians, engine technicians, avionics technicians.

===Military aircraft===
Military aircraft equipped with either weapons and / or an ejector seat will also require a dedicated weapons technician ground crew member.

===Non-powered flight===
Ground crew required for non-powered flight, such as gliders will include people who manually handle the glider aircraft from their storage location (such as an aircraft hangar) to their respective launch site, and then to return them at the end of flying. Aero-towed launched gliders will require ground crew commensurate with supporting the tow aircraft, which are typically single piston-engined general aviation (GA) small lightweight utility variants, often Cessna. For winch-launched gliders, ground crew will also include the winch-launch operator(s), and also a pay-out vehicle operator whose purpose is to draw or pay-out the winch launch cables (usually two cables per launch vehicle) which will be located at the far end of the upwind side of the airfield, to the gliders awaiting their turn to launch at the opposite end of the airfield.

===Non-controlled flight===
For those aircraft that do not possess any controls for changing the direction course of the aircraft, commonly known as hot-air balloons, these require particularly unique ground crew. Their roles include preparing the passenger basket (or gondola) with the correct amount of pressurized gas for the burners, testing of the burners, calculating the total mass of the balloon pilot and all passengers, calculating and applying appropriate ballast weight (fixed internal and releasable external). Then the assembly of the passenger basket to its lift balloon envelope, laying out the balloon envelope fabric in a manner that facilitates efficient inflation. Prior to launch, it will require personnel to &#x27;waft&#x27; the balloon envelope during horizontal burner operation to ensure an efficient fill. When the balloon envelope it itself airborne (but still not able to lift the basket with its pilot and any passengers), the ground crew will be required to hold ground tug ropes, to maintain the correct position of the balloon over the now vertically firing burner, and to prevent the basket from being uncontrollably dragged along the ground, until the balloon is totally full and capable of launch.

Once in flight, the hot air balloon ground crew undertakes a new task, that of driving one or more &#x27;chase vehicles&#x27;, initially to follow the progress and trajectory of the balloon in flight as best it can. Most hot air balloons have zero aviation-specific navigation aids, though modern pilots will typically utilize satellite navigation features found on many smartphones, along with the mobile voice telephony to maintain contact with the chase vehicle. The final task of the chase vehicle will be to locate and attend the balloon landing site, to repatriate any passengers back to their respective location, and also to thoroughly deflate the balloon envelope, then correctly fold and stow away the envelope, along with the basket, and deliver all balloon equipment and its pilot back to their preferred location.

Ground crew who are employed by the individual airport include personnel who are tasked to do the following operations: aircraft fuelling suppliers, toilet effluent tank extraction operatives, interior cabin cleaners, aircraft exterior de-icing operatives, on-board food delivery suppliers (for crew and passengers), baggage, cargo and / or freight handlers (for loading and offloading into the lower hold), ramp agents and boarding gate operatives, flight dispatchers, and even customer service agents, may also loosely be described as ground crew.

Other typical airport ground crew include personnel who are responsible for regular routine sweeping of all operational runways, runway exits and hold points, taxiways, hardstanding (parking) areas, and passenger terminal areas (including sky-bridges or &#x27;gates&#x27;); for clearing of any general and typical debris or garbage (most commonly collected on runways is tyre debris, and wind-blown dirt, sand, earth, grass, etc.; not only from ambient winds, but also from the vortices generated by the aerodynamic elements of an aircraft at speed, along with engine induction and jet exhaust thrust). This is absolutely critical to safe airport operations, as it the major process used to prevent foreign object damage (FOD), whereby a foreign object could sucked into an aircraft engine, or cut and puncture aircraft tyres. On military facilities, ground crew members are tasked with daily FOD walks, or &#x27;FOD plods&#x27;, whereby a team of people will fan out in a line across the entire width of the runway, and walk the length of the entire active runway, to visually inspect the runway surface, and its immediate environs, to look for and removes any items or &#x27;foreign objects&#x27; found; this is typically done in the morning, prior to the first despatch of an aircraft for that day.

Virtually all airports which cater for large aircraft will have a fleet of pushback tugs. Other possible classifications of airport ground crews may include airport shuttle bus drivers, airport firefighters, first aid and qualified medical services, police (often armed in these days of high risks of potential terrorist attacks), and general guard and security services. Airports with international connections will also have passport control agents, border, customs and immigration force officers. Many airports also have a live animal reception centre, staffed by vets, veterinary nurses, and administrators; for the purposes of checking animal health and welfare, along with correct documentation such as permits to fly, pet passports, etc., and will also be responsible for the prevention of importing any illegal, prohibited, or endangered species of animal.

Dependent on geographic location, other airport ground crew may also employ winter service vehicles, specifically snow clearance vehicles; including fleets of multiple sweepers, ploughs, and snow blowers. Ground de-icing operatives may be used; whereby one or more vehicles, similar to an agricultural crop sprayer with fold-out extendible boom arms is used to spray a non-corrosive aircraft-safe de-icing fluid onto all operational hard surfaces, to melt any existing surface ice, and prevent the formation of new ice during the certified operating hours of the airport. Furthermore, teams of avian dispersal agents, commonly known as &#x27;bird scarers&#x27; will be utilised to clear any birds, especially along the entire length runway, and also on the runway approach glide-paths, and runway departure paths.

===Military airport===
For military airbases which operate (or may be required to operate) armed aircraft, i.e., those aircraft capable of carrying explosive ordnance, or rapid-fire canons; an extremely specific ground crew role is the weapons technician.

<doc id="1001919" wikidata="Q1501578" url="?curid=1001919" title="Management buyout">
<text>A management buyout (MBO) is a form of acquisition in which a company&#x27;s existing managers acquire a large part, or all, of the company, whether from a parent company or individual. Management- and/or leveraged buyouts became noted phenomena of 1980s business economics. These so-called MBOs originated in the US, spreading first to the UK and then throughout the rest of Europe. The venture capital industry has played a crucial role in the development of buyouts in Europe, especially in smaller deals in the UK, the Netherlands, and France.

== Overview ==
Management buyouts are similar in all major legal aspects to any other acquisition of a company. The particular nature of the MBO lies in the position of the buyers as managers of the company and the practical consequences that follow from that. In particular, the due diligence process is likely to be limited as the buyers already have full knowledge of the company available to them. The seller is also unlikely to give any but the most basic warranties to the management, on the basis that the management know more about the company than the sellers do and therefore the sellers should not have to warrant the state of the company. 

Some concerns about management buyouts are that the asymmetric information
possessed by management may offer them unfair advantage relative to current owners. The impending possibility of an MBO may lead to principal–agent problems, moral hazard, and perhaps even the subtle downward manipulation of the stock price prior to sale via adverse information disclosure, including accelerated and aggressive loss recognition, public launching of questionable projects, and adverse earning surprises. These issues make recovery by shareholders who bring suit challenging the MBO more likely than challenges to other kinds of mergers and acquisitions.
Naturally, these corporate governance concerns also exist whenever current senior management is able to benefit personally from the sale of their company or its assets. This would include, for example, large parting bonuses for CEOs after a takeover or management buyout. 

Since corporate valuation is often subject to considerable uncertainty and ambiguity, and since it can be heavily influenced by asymmetric or inside information, some question the validity of MBOs and consider them to potentially represent a form of insider trading.

The mere possibility of an MBO or a substantial parting bonus on sale may create perverse incentives that can reduce the efficiency of a wide range of firms—even if they remain as public companies. This represents a substantial potential negative externality. The managers of the target company may at times also set up a holding company for the purpose of purchasing the shares of the target company.

==Purpose==

Management buyouts are conducted by management teams as they want to get the financial reward for the future development of the company more directly than they would do as employees only. A management buyout can also be attractive for the seller as they can be assured that the future stand-alone company will have a dedicated management team thus providing a substantial downside protection against failure and hence negative press. Additionally, in the case the management buyout is supported by a private equity fund (see below), the private equity will, given that there is a dedicated management team in place, likely pay an attractive price for the asset.

==Financing==

===Debt financing===
The management of a company will not usually have the money available to buy the company outright themselves. They would first seek to borrow from a bank, provided the bank was willing to accept the risk. Management buyouts are frequently seen as too risky for a bank to finance the purchase through a loan. Management teams are typically asked to invest an amount of capital that is significant to them personally, depending on the funding source/banks determination of the personal wealth of the management team. The bank then loans the company the remaining portion of the amount paid to the owner. Companies that proactively shop aggressive funding sources should qualify for total debt financing of at least four times (4×) cash flow.

===Private equity financing===
If a bank is unwilling to lend, the management will commonly look to private equity investors to fund the majority of buyout. A high proportion of management buyouts are financed in this way. The private equity investors will invest money in return for a proportion of the shares in the company, though they may also grant a loan to the management. The exact financial structuring will depend on the backer&#x27;s desire to balance the risk with its return, with debt being less risky but less profitable than capital investment.

Although the management may not have resources to buy the company, private equity houses will require that the managers each make as large an investment as they can afford in order to ensure that the management are locked in by an overwhelming vested interest in the success of the company. It is common for the management to re-mortgage their houses in order to acquire a small percentage of the company.

Private equity backers are likely to have somewhat different goals to the management. They generally aim to maximise their return and make an exit after 3–5 years while minimising risk to themselves, whereas the management rarely look beyond their careers at the company and will take a long-term view.

While certain aims do coincide—in particular the primary aim of profitability—certain tensions can arise. The backers will invariably impose the same warranties on the management in relation to the company that the sellers will have refused to give the management. This &quot;warranty gap&quot; means that the management will bear all the risk of any defects in the company that affect its value.

As a condition of their investment, the backers will also impose numerous terms on the management concerning the way that the company is run. The purpose is to ensure that the management run the company in a way that will maximise the returns during the term of the backers&#x27; investment, whereas the management might have hoped to build the company for long-term gains. Though the two aims are not always incompatible, the management may feel restricted.

The European buyout market was worth €43.9bn in 2008, a 60% fall on the €108.2bn of deals in 2007. The last time the buyout market was at this level was in 2001 when it reached just €34bn.

===Seller financing===
In certain circumstances, it may be possible for the management and the original owner of the company to agree a deal whereby the seller finances the buyout. The price paid at the time of sale will be nominal, with the real price being paid over the following years out of the profits of the company. The timescale for the payment is typically 3–7 years.

This represents a disadvantage for the selling party, which must wait to receive its money after it has lost control of the company. It is also dependent, if an earn-out is used, on the returned profits being increased significantly following the acquisition, in order for the deal to represent a gain to the seller in comparison to the situation pre-sale. This will usually only happen in very particular circumstances. The optimum structure would be to convert the earn-out to contracted deferred consideration which has compelling benefits for the seller as it legally fixes the total future amount paid to them. It&#x27;s paid like a quarterly annuity, and then the seller needs to secure the annuity by taking out a deferred consideration surety guarantee from an independent surety institution. The direct beneficiary of the surety is the seller and should the sold firm become insolvent, following its sale, with any outstanding deferred payments due the seller, then the surety will pay the money to the vendor on the purchaser&#x27;s behalf. 

The vendor agrees to vendor financing for tax reasons, as the consideration will be classified as capital gain rather than as income. It may also receive some other benefit such as a higher overall purchase price than would be obtained by a normal purchase.

The advantage for the management is that they do not need to become involved with private equity or a bank and will be left in control of the company once the consideration has been paid.

==Examples==
A classic example of an MBO involved Springfield Remanufacturing Corporation, a former plant in Springfield, Missouri, owned by Navistar (at that time, International Harvester) which was in danger of being closed or sold to outside parties until its managers purchased the company. 

In the UK, New Look was the subject of a management buyout in 2004 by Tom Singh, the founder of the company who had floated it in 1998. He was backed by private equity houses Apax and Permira, who now own 60% of the company. An earlier example of this in the UK was the management buyout of Virgin Interactive from Viacom which was led by Mark Dyne.

The Virgin Group has undergone several management buyouts in recent years. On September 17, 2007, Richard Branson announced that the UK arm of Virgin Megastores was to be sold off as part of a management buyout, and from November 2007, will be known by a new name, Zavvi. On September 24, 2008, another part of the Virgin group, Virgin Comics underwent a management buyout and changed its name to Liquid Comics. In the UK, Virgin Radio also underwent a similar process and became Absolute Radio&quot;.

In Australia, another group of music and entertainment stores were subject to a management buyout in September 2009, when Sanity&#x27;s owner and founder, Brett Blundy, sold BB Retail Capital&#x27;s Entertainment Division (including Sanity, and the Australian franchises of Virgin Entertainment and HMV) to the company&#x27;s Head of Entertainment, Ray Itaoui. This was for an undisclosed sum, leaving Sanity Entertainment to become a private company in its own right.

&quot;Hitman&quot; is a stealth video game series developed by the Danish company IO Interactive, which was previously published by Eidos Interactive and Square Enix. IO Interactive remained a subsidiary of Square Enix until 2017, when Square Enix started seeking sellers for the studio, IO Interactive completed a management buyout, regaining their independent status and retaining the rights for &quot;Hitman&quot;, in June 2017.

<text>Patrickswell, historically known as Toberpatrick (), is a small town in County Limerick, Ireland. It is primarily a commuter village for people working in Limerick, including the nearby industrial suburb of Raheen. The population was 848 at the 2022 census.

==Etymology==
The name of the town refers to a holy well which is traditionally associated with Saint Patrick. Located on the main street, this well was previously capped by a pump - since removed. In the early 19th century, a rough statue of Saint Patrick was erected at the well.

==History==
Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes a number of ringfort, fulacht fiadh and lime kiln sites in the surrounding townlands of Attyflin, Ballyanrahan East and Barnakyle. Protected structures, within the town, include St. Patrick&#x27;s holy well, an 18th century milestone, a lime kiln and the 19th century Royal Irish Constabulary barracks.

The former Patrickswell Railway Station, also a protected structure, was built in 1856 on the main Limerick–Tralee railway line. No longer used as a railway station, it is now in private ownership and home to an engineering consulting firm. A contemporary extension to the original station building was designed by Rob Shanahan architects and won an OPUS Building of the year award in 2004.

According to local historian Mainchín Seoighe (1924–2006), the present day ecclesiastical parish of Patrickswell-Ballybrown is made up parts of the pre-Reformation parishes of Kilkeedy, Killonahan, Mungret, Croom, and Adare. Until the middle of the 18th century, the parishes of Kilkeedy and Clounanna were joined with Adare. When the parish of Patrickswell was formed, Kilkeedy and Clounanna became part of the new parish.

During the Irish Civil War, the town played a role in the Battle of Kilmallock of 1922, when Anti-Treaty IRA troops dug in at Patrickswell to prevent Pro-Treaty National Army forces from reaching Limerick city.

==Location and transport==
The town is located near to the N20/N21 road which, until Patrickswell was bypassed in 2001, ran through the town centre. This road is now the R526 from west of the town to Limerick city. The town can be accessed at either end from the N20 junction for Limerick Racecourse, or the N20/N21 junction further west (where the R526 commences).

A railway line to Adare and Foynes passes alongside the town to the south, although Patrickswell station is long closed. Patrickswell railway station originally opened on 12 July 1856, closed for passenger traffic on 4 February 1963 and finally closed altogether on 2 December 1974. The Ballingrane–Tralee (North Kerry) line closed in November 1975. The station was, at one time, known as Patrickswell Junction and direct Limerick–Cork trains diverged here from the route of trains bound for Foynes, Newcastle West and Tralee. While passenger services ceased in 1963, freight trains between Limerick and Foynes ran until 2000.

==Amenities==
Patrickswell&#x27;s main street has several shops, a garage, ATM and a post office. The town is located approximately 10 km from Limerick city, and as a result relies on the city and its suburbs for secondary schools, shops, banks and other facilities.

There are several housing estates in the area, including several off the main street and road to Clarina. The latter road has strip development north from Patrickswell all the way to Clarina and the N69 road.

==Politics==
Patrickswell is located with the Limerick City West local authority area of Limerick City and County Council and within the Limerick City constituency for national politics.

<text>McClatchy Media Company, or simply McClatchy and MCC, is an American publishing company incorporated under Delaware&#x27;s General Corporation Law. Originally based in Sacramento, California, United States, and known as The McClatchy Company, it became a subsidiary of Chatham Asset Management, headquartered in Chatham Borough, New Jersey, as a result of its 2020 bankruptcy. 

The company operates 29 daily newspapers in 14 states and has an average weekday circulation of 1.6 million and Sunday circulation of 2.4 million. In 2006, it purchased Knight Ridder, which at the time was the second-largest newspaper company in the United States. In 2024, McClatchy merged with A360media. 

In addition to its daily newspapers, McClatchy also operates several websites and community papers, as well as a news agency, McClatchy DC Bureau, focused on political news from Washington, D.C.

==History==
The company originated with &quot;The Daily Bee&quot;, first published in Sacramento, California, on February 3, 1857, by Native American writer Rollin Ridge. James McClatchy joined Ridge as a partner and took over as editor. Known as a supporter of the people&#x27;s interests against corporations and corrupt politicians, McClatchy made &quot;The Bee&quot; a bastion of progressive reformism. Upon McClatchy&#x27;s death in 1883, the paper&#x27;s leadership passed to James&#x27; son, Charles Kenny McClatchy, who with his brother Valentine Stuart McClatchy, bought out the Ridge family&#x27;s interests. The two modernized the paper with the formation of &quot;McClatchy Newspapers&quot; through the founding of the &quot;Fresno Bee&quot; in 1922 and acquisition of the &quot;Modesto Bee&quot; in 1924. C.K. McClatchy&#x27;s legacy to the region has been memorialized in C.K. McClatchy High School in Sacramento, which opened in 1937, about a year after his death.

For most of its history, the company was focused on the newspaper business in California&#x27;s Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley. In 1978, the 4th generation Charles K. McClatchy took over the company and guided the media company toward the modern publicly owned &quot;The McClatchy Company&quot; through further acquisitions of out-of-state newspapers, the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; in Anchorage, Alaska, and the &quot;Tri-City Herald&quot; in Kennewick, Washington.

McClatchy also acquired then-ABC affiliate KOVR, licensed to Stockton, California but also serving the Sacramento area, from Metromedia in 1965. The company&#x27;s own &quot;Modesto Bee&quot; reported the sale of the station. It was sold to The Outlet Company in 1978 and today exists as a CBS owned-and-operated station.

In 1990, McClatchy acquired three dailies in South Carolina: &quot;The Herald&quot; in Rock Hill, &quot;The Island Packet&quot; in Hilton Head, and &quot;The Beaufort Gazette&quot; of Beaufort. In 1995, it acquired &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; of Raleigh, North Carolina.

In 1998, McClatchy purchased the Cowles Media Company, keeping the Minneapolis &quot;Star Tribune&quot; newspaper, which was the primary asset in the $1.4 billion deal, and selling Cowles&#x27; other business units to Primedia Inc. and to a management team.

In January 2004, McClatchy bought the &quot;Merced Sun-Star&quot; of Merced, and five affiliated non-dailies in California&#x27;s San Joaquin Valley.

The company&#x27;s biggest acquisition occurred on June 27, 2006, when McClatchy purchased Knight Ridder. Because McClatchy was so much smaller than Knight Ridder at the time, one observer equated the deal as &quot;a dolphin swallowing a small whale.&quot; The purchase price of $40 and 0.5118 shares of McClatchy Class A stock per share was valued in total at about $4 billion in cash and stock. The company also assumed $2 billion in debt. This purchase added 20 newspapers to the company stable and the immediate sale (over the next five weeks) of 12 publications including the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot;, &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. Those sales were completed on August 2, 2006. This acquisition would be cited as the major cause of McClatchy&#x27;s later troubles - McClatchy overpaid for Knight Ridder by buying at the &quot;top of the market&quot;, and the immense debt taken on to fuel the purchase would be a millstone around the neck of the combined company. Additionally, McClatchy did not keep on any of Knight Ridder&#x27;s digital division or corporate staff, despite the growing prominence of the Internet and Knight Ridder having a well-respected effort in the space at the time.

The Minneapolis-St. Paul &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, acquired in 1998 and sold in 2007 to the private-equity firm Avista Capital Partners for $555 million, had the highest circulation of all McClatchy newspapers.

The company owns a portfolio of digital assets, including 15.0% of CareerBuilder, LLC, which operates CareerBuilder.com; 25.6% of Classified Ventures, LLC, a company that offers classified websites, such as the auto website Cars.com; and 33.3% of HomeFinder, LLC, which operates the online real estate website HomeFinder.com. McClatchy also owns 49.5% of the voting stock and 70.6% of the nonvoting stock of The Seattle Times Company.

In January 2017, former Yahoo! and EarthLink executive Craig Forman was appointed as the new president and chief executive officer (CEO). Forman, a private investor and McClatchy board member, succeeded Patrick Talamantes, who was CEO the previous four years.

The descendants of C.K. McClatchy still own a controlling interest in the McClatchy Company and are represented by the 6th generation Kevin McClatchy as chairman of the Board of Directors.

In February 2019, Forman emailed all staff to say about 10 percent of the newspaper chain&#x27;s employees would be offered voluntary buyouts.

On February 13, 2020, The McClatchy Company and 54 affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The company cited pension obligations and excessive debt as the primary reasons for the filing. In August 2020, the Court approved an offer by Chatham Asset Management—a hedge fund that also owns a 66% share in Canadian publisher Postmedia—to acquire McClatchy for $312 million. The company stated that it would not impose any layoffs, and would honor all existing union agreements.

On July 11, 2023, McClatchy laid off the editorial cartoonists of three of its newspapers, Kevin Siers at &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, Jack Ohman at &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;, and Joel Pett at the &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot;.

In November 2023, McClatchy sold its Charlotte printing plant to North State Media for $4.65 million. The sale was publicly announced in August. The plant was developed by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1982 and sold to the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot;’s parent company in 2013. Following the sale, the plant&#x27;s 30-member staff stayed on at the newly established Charlotte Publishing Company.

In December 2024, McClatchy merged with A360media.

==Company infrastructure==
As of 2015, McClatchy had approximately 5,600 full and part-time employees. The company has two classes of stock, allowing the founding McClatchy family to retain control. In the Knight Ridder purchase, for example, McClatchy shareholders did not need to act in approving the purchase because the family had already voted their shares in favor.

&quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; reported in October 2006 that McClatchy&#x27;s revenue ending August 2006 was down over one percent from August 2005. Between the announced purchase of Knight Ridder in March 2006 and late 2009, the stock value of McClatchy (MNI) declined significantly. On December 18, 2008, McClatchy common stock fell below $1 per share. The market capitalization of the company fell below $100 million, down over 98% since the purchase of Knight Ridder in early 2006. In 2010–2011, the stock had recovered off of its low, but was still down over 90% from the peak.

In 2016, McClatchy approved a 1 for 10 reverse stock split that boosted the price of its shares to over $11.

McClatchy has an Internet subsidiary, McClatchy Interactive (formerly known as Nando Media), which provides business support and material for Internet media (part of the &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot; purchase).

McClatchy was part of a consortium of five U.S. newspaper companies that, along with a Canadian forrest products company, jointly owned the Ponderay Newsprint Mill near Spokane, Washington. The plant opened in 1989 and closed in 2020. A year later it sold for $18.1 million to a California-based venture capital company.

McClatchy also inherited a partnership with the Tribune Company in the news service Knight Ridder-Tribune Information Services, now McClatchy-Tribune Information Services (MCT), when it acquired Knight Ridder. In 2014, Tribune bought out McClatchy&#x27;s share of the company and its headquarters moved to Chicago.

===McClatchy DC Bureau===
McClatchyDC is a news agency that distributes original reporting from McClatchy&#x27;s Washington, D.C. bureau, which was acquired from Knight Ridder. It is the largest client of the McClatchy-Tribune Information Services.

In 2008, McClatchy&#x27;s bureau chief in D.C., John Walcott, was the first recipient of the I. F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence, awarded by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism. In accepting the award, Walcott commented on McClatchy&#x27;s reporting during the period preceding the Iraq War: &quot;Why, in a nutshell, was our reporting different from so much other reporting? One important reason was that we sought out the dissidents, and we listened to them, instead of serving as stenographers to high-ranking [Bush administration] officials and Iraqi exiles.&quot;

McClatchy journalists have also won nine Pulitzer prizes in their 159-year history, most recently in 2017 for an article on the Panama Papers. They were also finalists in 2015 for articles on government efforts to hide Bush-era CIA Enhanced interrogation techniques.

==Criticism==
On August 4, 2013, McClatchy Newspapers, citing anonymous sources, reported on conversations between Ayman al-Zawahiri, who succeeded Osama bin Laden as the head of Al Qaeda, and Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the head of the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, discussing an alleged imminent terrorist attack. Two days previously, &quot;The New York Times&quot; had agreed to withhold the identities of the Al Qaeda leaders after US intelligence officials claimed the information could jeopardize their operations. Government analysts and officials interviewed by the &quot;Times&quot; said this disclosure caused more immediate damage to American counter-terrorism efforts than the thousands of classified documents disclosed by Edward Snowden; after the McClatchy publication, there was a sharp drop in the terrorists&#x27; use of a major communications channel that the authorities were monitoring. Subsequently, officials have been searching for new ways to monitor communications among Al Qaeda&#x27;s leaders and operatives.

<text>The Star-Ledger was the largest circulation newspaper in New Jersey. It is based in Newark, New Jersey. The newspaper ceased print publication on February 2, 2025, however it continues to publish a digital edition of the paper.

In 2007, &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;″s daily circulation was reportedly more than the next two largest New Jersey newspapers combined, and its Sunday circulation was larger than the next three papers combined. It has suffered great declines in print circulation in recent years, to 180,000 daily in 2013, then to 114,000 &quot;individually paid print circulation,&quot; which is the number of copies being bought by subscription or at newsstands, in 2015.

In July 2013, the paper announced that it would sell its headquarters building in Newark. In the same year, Advance Publications announced it was exploring cost-saving changes among its New Jersey properties, but was not considering mergers or changes in publication frequency at any of the newspapers, nor the elimination of home delivery. On February 2, 2025, daily print operation ceased, but online coverage continued.

&quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; is a sister paper to &quot;The Jersey Journal&quot; in Secaucus&quot;, The Times&quot; in Trenton, and the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot;, all of which are owned by Advance Publications, headquartered in One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.

==History==
===Nineteenth century===
The &quot;Newark Daily Advertiser&quot;, founded in 1832, was Newark&#x27;s first daily newspaper. It subsequently evolved into the &quot;Newark Star-Eagle&quot;, owned by what eventually became Block Communications.

===Twentieth century===
In 1939, S. I. Newhouse bought the &quot;Star-Eagle&quot; from Block and merged it with the &quot;Newark Ledger&quot; to become the &quot;Newark Star-Ledger&quot;. The paper dropped Newark from its masthead sometime in the 1970s, but is still popularly called the &quot;Newark Star-Ledger&quot; by many residents of New Jersey.

During the 1960s &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;″s chief competitor was the &quot;Newark Evening News&quot;, once the most popular newspaper in New Jersey. In March 1971, the &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; surpassed the &quot;Evening News&quot; in daily circulation, because the Newark News was on strike. The &quot;Evening News&quot; shut down in 1972.

After the &quot;Newark Evening News&quot; moved to a high-traffic area (with the potential of trapping its delivery trucks in inner-city traffic) the &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; opened a satellite plant in Piscataway. The Piscataway location offered quick access to Union, Monmouth, Somerset, and Middlesex counties.

The &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; was the recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting in 2005 for its comprehensive coverage of the resignation of New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey, after he confessed to adultery with a male lover.

The paper awards the Star-Ledger Trophy each year to the number one high school teams in their respective sport in New Jersey.

===Twenty-first century===
In 2005, George Arwady became the publisher of &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;. A graduate of Columbia University, Arwady was previously the publisher of the &quot;Kalamazoo Gazette&quot; in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Having worked closely with the Newhouse family for years, Arwady was asked to move to Newark to oversee a financial revamping of the newspaper.

Due to financial losses, the paper&#x27;s parent company Advance Publications announced on July 31, 2008 that it would sell the &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; unless 200 non-union staff voluntarily left under a buyout offer, and its unionized truck drivers and mailers agreed to concessions. On September 16, publisher George Arwady sent employees an email saying that management felt progress had been made on the buyout and concessions from the mailers, but that management is &quot;far from an agreement with the Drivers&#x27; union.&quot; The email continued:
:Since it is doubtful that the Drivers will ratify an agreement by October 8, 2008, we will be sending formal notices to all employees this week, as required by both federal and New Jersey law, advising you that the Company will be sold, or, failing that, that it will close operations on January 5, 2009.

On October 24, 2008, the newspaper announced that 168 newsroom employees had offered to take the company&#x27;s buyout offer, and that the company had accepted 151 of them, which resulted in a 40% reduction in newsroom staff.

On January 16, 2013, the newspaper announced the layoffs of 34 employees including 18 newsroom staff.

In July, 2014, their Newark headquarters was sold to a New York developer, according to a news article released by the paper.

&quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; continues to publish seven days a week, and retains a presence in Newark in leased office space located within the downtown Gateway Center complex, where the publisher, the newspaper&#x27;s editorial board, its columnists, its magazine staff and a handful of other jobs will be based. Advance Publications, the owner of the newspaper, launched a new media company — NJ Advance Media — in 2014 to provide content, advertising and marketing services for its online presence at NJ.com, and many of its New Jersey newspapers out of the offices in Woodbridge. The sales and marketing staffs moved to Woodbridge in June 2014.

On September 14, 2023, the paper announced it will cease publication of its Saturday print edition, moving to an all-digital delivery of the Saturday edition beginning in 2024.

On October 30, 2024, the company announced it will cease daily print publication of the &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; on February 2, 2025, along with sister publications the &quot;Times of Trenton&quot; and &quot;South Jersey Times&quot;, due to rising costs, decreasing circulation and reduced demand for print. Online versions of the newspapers will continue to be offered, and newsroom coverage is not affected.

<text>Tasmannia is a genus of about 36 species of flowering plants in the family Winteraceae, and is native to Australia and New Guinea, with one species (&quot;Tasmannia piperita&quot;) also found in parts of Southeast Asia. Plants in the genus &quot;Tasmannia&quot; are shrubs or small trees, usually dioecious with simple leaves, mostly white, sometimes yellow flowers, and one to many clusters of berries.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Tasmannia&quot; are shrubs or small trees that are usually dioecious, with simple, aromatic leaves arranged alternately along the branchlets, and have fine oil dots. There are no stipules. The flowers are usually white, sometimes yellow and arranged singly in the axils of bud scales, appearing like an umbel, later becoming like a whorl. The sepals are joined together, completely enclosing the flower bud, later splitting into lobes. The fruit is a berry arranged singly or in clusters of up to 6.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Tasmannia&quot; was first formally described by published by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in his &quot;Regni Vegetabilis Systema Naturale&quot;, from an unpublished description by Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773).

The genus name, &quot;Tasmannia&quot; honours the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman.

The taxonomic status of, and evolutionary relationship between &quot;Tasmannia&quot; and &quot;Drimys&quot; has been the subject of controversy for many years. A 2004 paper by Andrew Doust and Andrew Dinnan confirmed that the two genera do not form a monophyletic group, although they share distinctive similarities in their flowers.

===Species list===
The following is a list of &quot;Tasmannia&quot; species accepted by Plants of the World Online as at April 2024:
==Distribution and habitat==
In Australia, the genus &quot;Tasmannia&quot; ranges from Tasmania and eastern Victoria and New South Wales to southeastern Queensland, and in the mountains of northeastern Queensland, where it grows in moist mountain forests and in wet areas in the drier forest and along watercourses to an elevation of 1500 m (5000 ft).

<doc id="1001931" wikidata="Q1098595" url="?curid=1001931" title="Ukrainian alphabet">
<text>The Ukrainian alphabet () is the set of letters used to write Ukrainian, which is the official language of Ukraine. It is one of several national variations of the Cyrillic script. It comes from the Cyrillic script, which was devised in the 9th century for the first Slavic literary language, called Old Slavonic. In the 10th century, Cyrillic script became used in Kievan Rus&#x27; to write Old East Slavic, from which the Belarusian, Russian, Rusyn, and Ukrainian alphabets later evolved. The modern Ukrainian alphabet has 33 letters in total: 21 consonants, 1 semivowel, 10 vowels and 1 palatalization sign. Sometimes the apostrophe (&#x27;) is also included, which has a phonetic meaning and is a mandatory sign in writing, but is not considered as a letter and is not included in the alphabet.

In Ukrainian, it is called (; &quot;ukrainska abetka&quot;), from the initial letters &quot;а&quot; ( &quot;a&quot;) and &quot;б&quot; ( &quot;b&quot;); ( &quot;alfavit&quot;); or, archaically, ( &quot;azbuka&quot;), from the acrophonic early Cyrillic letter names ( &quot;az&quot;) and ( &quot;buki&quot;).

Ukrainian text is sometimes romanised (written in the Latin alphabet) for non-Cyrillic readers or transcription systems. There are several common methods for romanizing Ukrainian including the international Cyrillic-to-Latin transcription standard ISO 9. There have also been several historical proposals for a native Ukrainian Latin alphabet, but none have caught on.

== Alphabet ==

The alphabet comprises 33 letters, representing 40 phonemes. The apostrophe is also used in the spelling of some words, but is not considered a letter. Ukrainian orthography is based on the phonemic principle, with one letter generally corresponding to one phoneme. The orthography also has cases in which semantic, historical, and morphological principles are applied. In the Ukrainian alphabet the &quot;Ь&quot; could also be the last letter in the alphabet (this was its official position from 1932 to 1990).

Twenty-one letters represent consonants (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ), ten represent vowels (, , , , , , , , , ), and one represents a semivowel (й). The soft sign , which appears only after consonants, indicates that the preceding consonant is soft (palatalized).

Also, alveolar consonants are palatalized when followed by certain vowels: , , , , , , , and are softened when they are followed by a &quot;soft&quot; vowel: , , , . See iotation.

The apostrophe negates palatalization in places that it would be applied by normal orthographic rules. It also appears after labial consonants in some words, such as &quot;name&quot;, and it is retained in transliterations from the Latin alphabet: (Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) and (O&#x27;Toole).

The apostrophe is used similarly in Belarusian orthography, while the same function is served in Russian by the hard sign (): compare Ukrainian and Belarusian vs. Russian (&quot;object&quot;).

There are other exceptions to the phonemic principle in the alphabet. Some letters represent two phonemes: , or , and , , when they do not palatalize a preceding consonant. The digraphs and are normally used to represent single affricates and . Palatalization of consonants before , , is indicated by writing the corresponding letter , , instead (theoretical palatalization before is not indicated as already corresponds to the palatized or &quot;soft&quot; counterpart of ).

Compared to other Cyrillic alphabets, the modern Ukrainian alphabet is most similar to those of the other East Slavic languages: Belarusian, Russian, and Rusyn. It has retained the two early Cyrillic letters і (i) and izhe () to represent related sounds and as well as the two historical forms e () and ye (). Its unique letters are the following:
*ge (), used for the less-common velar plosive sound, whereas in Ukrainian the common Cyrillic represents a glottal fricative, .
*yi () or .

== History ==

=== Early Cyrillic alphabet ===

The Cyrillic script was a writing system developed in the First Bulgarian Empire in the tenth century, to write the Old Church Slavonic liturgical language. It was named after Saint Cyril, who with his brother Methodius had created the earlier Glagolitic Slavonic script. Cyrillic was based on Greek uncial script, and adopted Glagolitic letters for some sounds which were absent in Greek – it also had some letters which were only used almost exclusively for Greek words or for their numeric value: Ѳ, Ѡ, Ѱ, Ѯ, Ѵ.

The early Cyrillic alphabet was brought to Kievan Rus&#x27; at the end of the first millennium, along with Christianity and the Old Church Slavonic language. The alphabet was adapted to the local spoken Old East Slavic language, leading to the development of indigenous East Slavic literary language alongside the liturgical use of Church Slavonic. The alphabet changed to keep pace with changes in language, as regional dialects developed into the modern Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian languages. Spoken Ukrainian has an unbroken history, but the literary language has suffered from two major historical fractures.

Various reforms of the alphabet by scholars of Church Slavonic, Ruthenian, and Russian languages caused the written and spoken word to diverge by varying amounts. Etymological rules from Greek and South Slavic languages made the orthography imprecise and difficult to master.

Meletii Smotrytskyi&#x27;s Slavonic Grammar of 1619 was very influential on the use of Church Slavonic, and codified the use of the letters Я (&quot;ya&quot;), Е (&quot;e&quot;), and Ґ (&quot;g&quot;). Various Russian alphabet reforms were influential as well, especially Peter the Great&#x27;s Civil Script of 1708 (the &quot;Grazhdanka&quot;). It created a new alphabet specifically for non-religious use, and adopted Latin-influenced letterforms for type. The Civil Script eliminated some archaic letters (Ѯ, Ѱ, Ѡ, Ѧ), but reinforced an etymological basis for the alphabet, influencing Mykhailo Maksymovych&#x27;s nineteenth-century Galician &quot;Maksymovychivka&quot; script for Ukrainian, and its descendant, the &quot;Pankevychivka&quot;, which is still in use, in a slightly modified form, for the Rusyn language in Carpathian Ruthenia.

=== Nineteenth-century reforms ===
In reaction to the hard-to-learn etymological alphabets, several reforms attempted to introduce a phonemic Ukrainian orthography during the nineteenth century, based on the example of Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s Serbian Cyrillic. These included Panteleimon Kulish&#x27;s &quot;Kulishivka&quot; alphabet used in his 1857 &quot;Notes on Southern Rus&quot;&#x27; and &quot;Hramatka&quot;, the &quot;Drahomanivka&quot; alphabet promoted in the 1870s by Mykhailo Drahomanov, and Yevhen Zhelekhivskyi&#x27;s &quot;Zhelekhivka&quot; alphabet from 1886, which standardized the letters ї (&quot;yi&quot;) and ґ (&quot;g&quot;).

A Ukrainian cultural revival of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries stimulated literary and academic activity in both Dnieper Ukraine (formerly part of the Russian Empire) and western Ukraine (Austrian-controlled Galicia). In Galicia, the Polish-dominated local government tried to introduce a Latin alphabet for Ukrainian, which backfired by prompting a heated &quot;War of the Alphabets&quot;, bringing the issue of orthography into the public eye. The Cyrillic script was favoured, but conservative Ukrainian cultural factions (the Old Ruthenians and Russophiles) opposed publications which promoted a pure Ukrainian orthography.

In Dnieper Ukraine, proposed reforms suffered from periodic bans of publication and performance in the Ukrainian language. One such decree was the notorious 1876 Ems Ukaz, which banned the Kulishivka and imposed a Russian orthography until 1905 (called the &quot;Yaryzhka&quot;, after the Russian letter yery ы). The Kulishivka was adopted by Ukrainian publications, only to be banned again from 1914 until after the February Revolution of 1917.

The Zhelekhivka became official in Galicia in 1893, and was adopted by many eastern Ukrainian publications after the Revolution. The People&#x27;s Republic of Ukraine adopted official Ukrainian orthographies in 1918 and 1919, and Ukrainian publication increased, and then flourished under Skoropadsky&#x27;s Hetmanate. Under the Bolshevik government of Ukraine, Ukrainian orthographies were confirmed in 1920 and 1921.

=== Unified orthography ===

In 1925, the Ukrainian SSR created a Commission for the Regulation of Orthography. During the period of Ukrainization in Soviet Ukraine, the 1927 International Orthographic Conference was convened in Kharkiv, from May 26 to June 6. At the conference, a standardized Ukrainian orthography and method for transliterating foreign words were established, a compromise between Galician and Soviet proposals, called the Ukrainian orthography of 1928, or &quot;Skrypnykivka&quot;, after Ukrainian Commissar of Education Mykola Skrypnyk. It was officially recognized by the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars in 1928, and by the Lviv Shevchenko Scientific Society in 1929, and adopted by the Ukrainian diaspora. The Skrypnykivka was the first universally adopted native Ukrainian orthography.

However, by 1930 Stalin&#x27;s government started to reverse the Ukrainization policy, partly attributing the peasant resistance to collectivization to Ukrainian nationalists. In 1933, the orthographic reforms were abolished, decrees were passed to bring the orthography steadily closer to Russian. His reforms discredited and labelled &quot;nationalist deviation&quot;, Skrypnyk committed suicide rather than face a show trial and execution or deportation. The Ukrainian letter ge ґ, and the phonetic combinations ль, льо, ля were eliminated, and Russian etymological forms were reintroduced (for example, the use of -іа- in place of -я-). An official orthography was published in Kyiv in 1936, with revisions in 1945 and 1960. This orthography is sometimes called &quot;Postyshivka&quot;, after Pavel Postyshev, Stalin&#x27;s official who oversaw the dismantling of Ukrainisation.

In the meantime, the Skrypnykivka continued to be used by Ukrainians in Galicia and the worldwide diaspora.

During the period of Perestroika in the USSR, a new Ukrainian Orthographic Commission was created in 1986. A revised orthography was published in 1990, reintroducing the letter ge &quot;ґ&quot;. It also revised the alphabetical order, moving the soft sign &quot;ь&quot; from the end of the alphabet, to a position before the letter &quot;ю&quot;, which helps sort Ukrainian text together with Belarusian (following a proposal by L. M. Ivanenko of the Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics).

On 21 May 2019, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved a new version of the orthography prepared by the Ukrainian National Commission on Spelling. The new edition brought to life some features of orthography in 1928, which were part of the Ukrainian orthographic tradition. At the same time, the commission was guided by the understanding that the language practice of Ukrainians in the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century has already become part of the Ukrainian orthographic tradition.

== Letter names and pronunciation ==

For other transliteration systems, see romanisation of Ukrainian.

Notes:

There are also digraphs which are pronounced as a single sound: , which is pronounced , like &quot;dg&quot; in &quot;knowledge&quot;, and , which is realized as . Examples: (, &quot;a bumble bee&quot;), (, &quot;a bee&quot;), (, &quot;a bell&quot;).

== Historic letters ==
== Letterforms and typography ==

In print, several lowercase Cyrillic letters resemble smaller versions of their corresponding uppercase forms.

Handwritten Cyrillic cursive letterforms vary somewhat from their corresponding printed (typeset) counterparts, particularly for the letters г, д, и, й, and т.

Like Latin script, whose typefaces have roman and italic forms, a Cyrillic type face (, ) has upright (, ) and cursive (курсивний, ) font forms, the latter of which later came to be called (, ). Several lowercase letters in the cursive printed form bear little resemblance to the corresponding lowercase letters in the upright printed form, more closely resembling the corresponding handwritten lowercase cursive forms instead, particularly for the letters г, д, и, й, п, and т.

Quoted text is typically enclosed in unspaced French guillemets («angle-quotes»), or in lower and upper quotation marks as in German.

== Encoding Ukrainian ==

There are various character encodings for representing Ukrainian with computers.

=== ISO 8859-5 ===

ISO 8859-5 encoding is missing the letter &quot;ґ&quot;.

=== KOI8-U ===

KOI8-U stands for &quot;Код обміну інформації 8 бітний — український&quot;, &quot;Code for information
interchange 8 bit — Ukrainian&quot;, analogous to &quot;ASCII&quot;. KOI8-U is a Ukrainianized version of KOI8-R.

=== Windows-1251 ===
Windows-1251 works for the Ukrainian alphabet, as well as for other Cyrillic alphabets.

=== Unicode ===
Ukrainian falls within the Cyrillic (U+0400 to U+04FF) and Cyrillic Supplementary (U+0500 to U+052F) blocks of Unicode. The characters in the range U+0400–U+045F are basically the characters from ISO 8859-5 moved upward by 864 positions.

In the following table, Ukrainian letters have titles indicating their Unicode information and HTML entity. In a visual browser you can hold the mouse pointer over the letter to see this information.

=== Web pages and XML ===

Elements in HTML and XML would normally have the Ukrainian language indicated using the IETF language tag codice_1 (codice_2 in HTML and codice_3 in XML). Although indicating the writing system is normally not necessary, this can be accomplished by adding a script subtag, for example to distinguish Cyrillic Ukrainian text (codice_4) from romanized Ukrainian (codice_5).

<text>Hachette Livre S.A. (; simply known as Hachette) is a French publishing group that was based in Paris. It was founded in 1826 by Louis Hachette as Brédif which later became successively L. Hachette et Compagnie, Librairie Hachette, Hachette SA and is then currently known in France as Hachette Livre. After acquiring an Australian publisher, Hachette Australia was created; in the UK it became Hachette UK, and its expansion into the United States became [[Hachette Book Group]].

Hachette Livre has been owned by the Lagardère Group since 1981 under their publishing division Lagardère Publishing. Lagardère Group in turn is majority owned by the French conglomerate Louis Hachette Group (LHG), resulting from the spin-off of Vivendi.

==History==
===France===
It was founded in 1826 by Louis Hachette as Brédif, a bookshop and publishing company. It became L. Hachette et Compagnie on 1 January 1846, Librairie Hachette in 1919, and Hachette SA in 1977. The company was family led for several generations, including by Hachette&#x27;s great-grandson, Robert Meunier du Houssoy. It was acquired by the Lagardère Group in 1981. In 1992, the publishing assets of Hachette SA were grouped into a subsidiary called Hachette Livre (), the flagship imprint of Lagardère Publishing. Hachette has its headquarters in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. In 1996, it merged with the Hatier group. In 2004, Hachette acquired dictionary publisher Éditions Larousse.

===International expansion===
In 2002, UK publisher John Murray was acquired by Hodder Headline, which was itself acquired in 2004 by the Lagardère Group. Since then, it has been an imprint under Lagardère brand known as Hachette UK.

In 2004, Lagardère acquired Australian publisher Hodder Headline for Hachette Livre, who renamed it Hachette Australia.

In 2006, it expanded into the United States when it purchased Time Warner&#x27;s book-publishing division, which was then renamed Hachette Book Group USA. Part of Time Warner&#x27;s holdings was Australian independent publishing house Lothian Books, which was incorporated as an imprint.

In June 2013, Hachette announced that it would acquire the adult trade business of Hyperion Books from Disney. (Disney retained the young adult business and books related to existing Disney–ABC TV properties, under an expanded Disney–Hyperion imprint.)

In 2018, it announced its &quot;Robinson Millenials&quot; label, under which it would be publishing webcomics in partnership with Hiveworks Comics.

Hachette UK acquired Laurence King Publishing, original publisher of adult colouring book author and illustrator Johanna Basford, in August 2020. In 2022, it acquired Welbeck Publishing Group.

==Corporate affairs==
Since April 2015, Hachette&#x27;s headquarters have been located at 58 rue Jean-Bleauzen in Vanves (department Hauts-de-Seine, France).

Hachette&#x27;s head office previously occupied a building at the intersection of the Boulevards Saint-Germain and Saint-Michel in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés area, then from 2006 to 2015 in Grenelle, in Paris&#x27;s 15th arrondissement.

In June 2014, the company&#x27;s U.S. affiliate in conjunction with Perseus Books Group, and Ingram Content Group, announced a three-way deal whereby Hachette would buy Perseus and then sell the company&#x27;s client services businesses to Ingram. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. However, in August 2014, the deal was called off because Hachette and the other parties involved decided the deal was too complicated. The deal eventually went through in April 2016 with Perseus&#x27;s publishing assets and imprints going to Hachette, and distribution assets to Ingram.

Hachette&#x27;s English-language businesses in the UK and the U.S. will be moved to a single management team in January 2024, with Hachette UK CEO David Chelley taking the same position at the Hachette Book Group USA and reporting to the Hachette Livre chairman and CEO Arnaud Lagardère.

==Company structure==
Hachette Livre is involved in three core businesses: publishing, partworks and distribution.

<doc id="1001941" wikidata="Q2604498" url="?curid=1001941" title="Oscillator (cellular automaton)">
<text>In a cellular automaton, an oscillator is a pattern that returns to its original state, in the same orientation and position, after a finite number of generations. Thus the evolution of such a pattern repeats itself indefinitely. Depending on context, the term may also include spaceships as well.

The smallest number of generations it takes before the pattern returns to its initial condition is called the &quot;period&quot; of the oscillator. An oscillator with a period of 1 is usually called a [[still life (cellular automaton)|still life]], as such a pattern never changes. Sometimes, still lifes are not taken to be oscillators. Another common stipulation is that an oscillator must be finite.

==Examples==
In Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, oscillators had been identified and named as early as 1971. Since then it has been shown that finite oscillators exist for all periods. Additionally, until July 2022, the only known examples for period 34 were considered trivial because they consisted of essentially separate components that oscillate at smaller periods. For instance, one can create a period 34 oscillator by placing period 2 and period 17 oscillators so that they do not interact. An oscillator is considered non-trivial if it contains at least one cell that oscillates at the necessary period.

<doc id="1001945" wikidata="Q6945811" url="?curid=1001945" title="My Learned Friend">
<text>My Learned Friend is a 1943 British, black-and-white, comedy, farce, directed by Basil Dearden with his regular collaborator, Will Hay, as the film&#x27;s star in the role of William Fitch. The principal supporting roles were taken by Claude Hulbert and Mervyn Johns . Character roles went to Laurence Hanray as Sir Norman, Charles Victor as &quot;Safety&quot; Wilson, Ernest Thesiger as Ferris and Ronald Shiner as the Man in Wilson&#x27;s café. It was produced by Michael Balcon, Robert Hamer and Ealing Studios.

The film&#x27;s title refers to a tradition in British law: when addressing either the court or the judge, a barrister refers to the opposing counsel using the respectful term, &quot;my learned friend&quot;.

This was Will Hay&#x27;s last film; Hay went on to star as &quot;Doctor Muffin&quot; in The Will Hay Programme that aired on the radio in 1944. The humour of My Learned Friend took a darker turn than any of Hay&#x27;s earlier films.

==Plot==
This comedy sees Will Hay playing a seedy lawyer, who finds himself marked for assassination by a forger whom he previously defended unsuccessfully. He teams up with an incompetent solicitor to try to prevent the deaths of others involved.

The film climaxes with a sequence where Hay hangs from the hands of the clock face of Big Ben in an attempt to prevent a time bomb being detonated.

<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command-line utility on Unix and Unix-like operating systems that compares two files of any type and writes the results to the standard output. By default, codice_1 is silent if the files are the same; if they differ, the byte and line number at which the first difference occurred is reported. The command is also available in the OS-9 shell.

==History==
 is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification. It first appeared in Version 1 Unix.
The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Torbjorn Granlund and David MacKenzie.
The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

==Switches==
 may be qualified by the use of command-line switches. The switches supported by notable implementations of are:

Operands that are byte counts are normally decimal, but may be preceded by &quot; for octal and &quot; for hexadecimal.

A byte count can be followed by a suffix to specify a multiple of that count; in this case an omitted integer is understood to be 1. A bare size letter, or one followed by &quot;, specifies a multiple using powers of 1024. A size letter followed by &quot; specifies powers of 1000 instead. For example, &quot; and &quot; are equivalent to &quot;, whereas &quot; is equivalent to &quot;. This notation is upward compatible with the SI prefixes for decimal multiples and with the IEC 60027-2 prefixes for binary multiples.

<doc id="1001962" wikidata="Q7445692" url="?curid=1001962" title="Seeds (cellular automaton)">
<text>Seeds is a cellular automaton in the same family as the Game of Life, initially investigated by Brian Silverman and named by Mirek Wójtowicz. It consists of an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which may be in one of two states: &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;. Each cell is considered to have eight neighbors (Moore neighborhood), as in Life. In each time step, a cell turns on or is &quot;born&quot; if it was off or &quot;dead&quot; but had exactly two neighbors that were on; all other cells turn off. Thus, in the notation describing the family of cellular automata containing Life, it is described by the rule B2/S.

In Game of Life terminology, a pattern in which all cells that were on turn off at each step is called a &quot;phoenix&quot;. All patterns in Seeds have this form.
Even though all live cells are constantly dying, the small birth requirement of two cells means that nearly every pattern in Seeds explodes into a chaotic mess that grows to cover the entire universe. Thus, in Wolfram&#x27;s classification of cellular automata, it is a Class III automaton, in which nearly all patterns evolve chaotically.

However, some patterns are known to behave in a more controlled fashion, repeating the same shape either in the same position of the grid (an oscillator) or translated some number of grid units after several steps (a spaceship). More complex rake and puffer patterns are known which move like spaceships leaving trails of oscillators or other spaceships behind them. Most of these patterns move at a speed of 1 cell per time step (the so-called &quot;speed of light&quot;, or c/1) including three commonly seen spaceships with four on cells each, but slower-moving patterns are also known. A collection of patterns for the Seeds rule collected by Jason Summers includes patterns found by Stephen Wright, Mirek Wójtowicz, Noam Elkies, Mark Niemiec, Peter Naszvadi, and David Eppstein.

<doc id="1001964" wikidata="Q259200" url="?curid=1001964" title="Marian Keyes">
<text>Marian Keyes (born 10 September 1963) is an Irish author and radio presenter. She is principally known for her popular fiction.

Keyes became known for her novels &quot;Watermelon&quot;, &quot;Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married&quot;, &quot;Rachel&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, &quot;Last Chance Saloon&quot;, &quot;Anybody Out There&quot;, and &quot;This Charming Man&quot;, which, although written in a light and humorous style, cover themes including alcoholism, depression, addiction, cancer, bereavement, and domestic violence. More than 35 million copies of her novels have been sold, and her works have been translated into 33 languages. Her writing has won both the Irish Popular Fiction Book and the Popular Non-Fiction Book of the Year, each on one occasion, at the Irish Book Awards.

==Biography==
Keyes comes from a large family, with many siblings. She was born in Limerick and raised in Cork, Galway, and in Monkstown, County Dublin. She graduated from University College Dublin with a law degree, and after completing her studies, she took an administrative job before moving to London in 1986. During this period she became an alcoholic and was affected by clinical depression, culminating in a suicide attempt and subsequent rehabilitation in 1995 at the Rutland Centre in Dublin. In an article for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Keyes details how her struggles with anxiety, depression, and alcoholism began at an early age. Keyes appeared on BBC&#x27;s Imagine, aired in February 2022, explaining to Alan Yentob how she was distracted from her resolved end-of-life attempt by an episode of &quot;Come Dine With Me&quot;; husband and assistant Tony defused the drama by saying, &quot;let&#x27;s see how you feel when we&#x27;ve finished watching it,&quot; and so began her slow recovery from depression.

Keyes began writing short stories while suffering from alcoholism. After her treatment at the Rutland Centre she returned to her job in London and submitted her short stories to Poolbeg Press. The publisher encouraged her to submit a full-length novel and Keyes began work on her first book, &quot;Watermelon&quot;. The novel was published the same year. Since 1995 she has published many novels and works of non-fiction.

Keyes has written frankly about her clinical depression, which left her unable to sleep, read, write, or talk. After a long hiatus due to severe depression, a food title, &quot;Saved by Cake&quot;, was published in February 2012.

Keyes&#x27; depressive period lasted about four years. During this time she also wrote &quot;The Mystery of Mercy Close&quot;, a novel in which the heroine experiences similar battles with depression and suicide attempts as those Keyes herself experienced. As Keyes further describes this period of her life: &quot;It was like being in an altered reality . . . I was always melancholic and prone to sadness and hopelessness but this was catastrophic and unimaginable.&quot;

In March 2017, Keyes was a guest castaway for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. Her favourite track was &quot;You Have Been Loved&quot; by George Michael. She revealed that she had battled constant suicidal urges at the height of her mental illness. During her appearance on the show, Keyes also told host Kirsty Young that in spite of all her efforts to treat her depression, including cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, mindfulness, hospitalisation and diets, what finally healed her was time: &quot;It was an illness and it ran its course.&quot;

In 2019 the National Library of Ireland announced that the Keyes digital archive for her novel &quot;The Mystery of Mercy Close&quot; would be acquired by the Library as a pilot project for collecting &quot;born digital&quot; archives.

In 2021 and 2022, Keyes joined Tara Flynn in a series for BBC Radio 4 called &#x27;Now You&#x27;re Asking&#x27;, in which they discussed problems sent in by listeners (they called them &#x27;askers&#x27;).

Keyes lives in Dún Laoghaire with her husband Tony Baines (whom she first met on his 30th birthday) after returning to Ireland from Hampstead in 1997.

==Style==
Although many of her novels are known as comedies, they revolve around dark themes, often drawn from Keyes&#x27;s own experiences, including domestic violence, drug abuse, mental illness, divorce and alcoholism. Keyes considers herself a feminist, and has chosen to reflect feminist issues in many of her books.

Keyes&#x27; stories usually revolve around a strong female character who overcomes numerous obstacles to achieve lasting happiness. Regarding her decision to use an optimistic tone and hopeful ending, Keyes has said: &quot;I&#x27;m very bleak, really melancholic. But I&#x27;ve always used humour as a survival mechanism. I write for me and I need to feel hopeful about the human condition. So no way I&#x27;m going to write a downbeat ending. And it isn&#x27;t entirely ludicrous to suggest that sometimes things might work out for the best.&quot;

Critics recognise Keyes&#x27;s writing as tackling difficult subjects in a relatable fashion. As told to &quot;The Irish Times&quot; by another Irish author: &quot;It’s a rare gift...The only other writer I can think of who writes so hilariously and movingly about serious subjects was the late, great Sue Townsend.&quot;

==Views==
During her appearance on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in March 2017, Keyes told the host that &quot;[by] conditioning women to think that what they find empowering or valuable is worth less than what men consider to be worthwhile, women are prevented from reaching for parity and the gender gap in power and money between men and women is kept in the favour of men&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in 2017, Keyes announced that she suspected &quot;gender bias&quot; to be at play when it comes to the recognition of women writers. She said that, despite her perceived success and acclaim, male writers with less commercial success were held in higher regard. &quot;Do you remember in the early noughties when a lot of Irish women writers like Cathy Kelly, Sheila O&#x27;Flanagan, Cecelia Ahern were selling all over the world? I don’t feel that was celebrated enough.&quot; She went on to &quot;wonder&quot; that &quot;if a group of young Irish men around the same age had been selling in huge numbers&quot;, before concluding: &quot;I really think it would not have passed unremarked.&quot; Similarly, Keyes has rejected the term &quot;chick lit.&quot; During an author Q &amp; A in 2014 with Canada&#x27;s &quot;Chatelaine&quot; magazine, when asked how she feels about the term, Keyes claimed that &quot;it’s meant to be belittling. It’s as if it’s saying, &#x27;Oh you silly girls, with your pinkness and shoes, how will you ever run the world?&#x27; But as I’ve matured (haha) I’ve realised that I&#x27;m very proud of what I write about and I know that the books I write bring happiness and comfort to people&quot;. At an event at the Edinburgh Book Festival in August 2020, Keyes rejected the term chick lit as dismissive and sexist, as men writing similar fiction are not described as &quot;dick lit&quot;.

<text>E-Science or eScience is computationally intensive science that is carried out in highly distributed network environments, or science that uses immense data sets that require grid computing; the term sometimes includes technologies that enable distributed collaboration, such as the Access Grid. The term was created by John Taylor, the Director General of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Office of Science and Technology in 1999 and was used to describe a large funding initiative starting in November 2000. E-science has been more broadly interpreted since then, as &quot;the application of computer technology to the undertaking of modern scientific investigation, including the preparation, experimentation, data collection, results dissemination, and long-term storage and accessibility of all materials generated through the scientific process. These may include data modeling and analysis, electronic/digitized laboratory notebooks, raw and fitted data sets, manuscript production and draft versions, pre-prints, and print and/or electronic publications.&quot; In 2014, IEEE eScience Conference Series condensed the definition to &quot;eScience promotes innovation in collaborative, computationally- or data-intensive research across all disciplines, throughout the research lifecycle&quot; in one of the working definitions used by the organizers. E-science encompasses &quot;what is often referred to as big data [which] has revolutionized science... [such as] the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN... [that] generates around 780 terabytes per year... highly data intensive modern fields of science...that generate large amounts of E-science data include: computational biology, bioinformatics, genomics&quot; and the human digital footprint for the social sciences.

Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined &quot;data-intensive science&quot; or &quot;e-science&quot; as a &quot;fourth paradigm&quot; of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that &quot;everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology&quot; and the data deluge.

E-Science revolutionizes both fundamental legs of the scientific method: empirical research, especially through digital big data; and scientific theory, especially through computer simulation model building. These ideas were reflected by The White House&#x27;s Office and Science Technology Policy in February 2013, which slated many of the aforementioned e-Science output products for preservation and access requirements under the memorandum&#x27;s directive. E-sciences include particle physics, earth sciences and social simulations.

== Characteristics and examples==

Most of the research activities into e-Science have focused on the development of new computational tools and infrastructures to support scientific discovery. Due to the complexity of the software and the backend infrastructural requirements, e-Science projects usually involve large teams managed and developed by research laboratories, large universities or governments. Currently there is a large focus in e-Science in the United Kingdom, where the UK e-Science programme provides significant funding. In Europe the development of computing capabilities to support the CERN Large Hadron Collider has led to the development of e-Science and Grid infrastructures which are also used by other disciplines.

=== Consortiums ===

Example e-Science infrastructures include the
Worldwide LHC Computing Grid,
a federation with various partners including the
European Grid Infrastructure, the Open Science Grid and the
Nordic DataGrid Facility.

To support e-Science applications, Open Science Grid combines interfaces to more than 100 nationwide clusters, 50 interfaces to geographically distributed storage caches, and 8 campus grids (Purdue, Wisconsin-Madison, Clemson, Nebraska-Lincoln, FermiGrid at FNAL, SUNY-Buffalo, and Oklahoma in the United States; and UNESP in Brazil). Areas of science benefiting from Open Science Grid include:

* astrophysics, gravitational physics, high-energy physics, neutrino physics, nuclear physics
* molecular dynamics, materials science, materials engineering, computer science, computer engineering, nanotechnology
* structural biology, computational biology, genomics, proteomics, medicine

=== UK programme ===

After his appointment as Director General of the Research Councils in 1999 John Taylor, with the support of the Science Minister David Sainsbury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, bid to HM Treasury to fund a programme of e-infrastructure development for science which would provide the foundation for UK science and industry to be a world leader in the knowledge economy which motivated the Lisbon Strategy for sustainable economic growth that the UK government committed to in March 2000.

In November 2000 John Taylor announced £98 million for a national UK e-Science programme. An additional £20 million contribution was planned from UK industry in matching funds to projects that they participated in. From this budget of £120 million over three years, £75 million was to be spent on grid application pilots in all areas of science, administered by the Research Council responsible for each area, while £35 million was to be administered by the EPSRC as a Core Programme to develop &quot;industrial strength&quot; Grid middleware. Phase 2 of the programme for 2004-2006 was supported by a further £96 million for application projects, and £27 million for the EPSRC core programme. Phase 3 of the programme for 2007-2009 was supported by a further £14 million for the EPSRC core programme and a further sum for applications. Additional funding for UK e-Science activities was provided from European Union funding, from university funding council SRIF funding for hardware, and from Jisc for networking and other infrastructure.

The UK e-Science programme comprised a wide range of resources, centres and people including the National e-Science Centre (NeSC) which is managed by the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, with facilities in both cities.
Tony Hey led the core programme from 2001 to 2005.

Within the UK regional e-Science centres support their local universities and projects, including:
* White Rose Grid e-Science Centre (WRGeSC)
* Belfast e-Science Centre (BeSC)
* Centre for eResearch Bristol (CeRB)
* Cambridge e-Science Centre (CeSC)
* STFC e-Science Centre (STFCeSC)
* e-Science North West (eSNW)
* National Grid Service (NGS)
* OMII-UK
* Lancaster University Centre for e-Science
* London e-Science Centre (LeSC)
* North East Regional e-Science Centre (NEReSC)
* Oxford e-Science Centre (OeSC)
* Southampton e-Science Centre (SeSC)
* Welsh e-Science Centre (WeSC)
* Midlands e-Science Centre (MeSC)

There are also various centres of excellence and research centres.

In addition to centres, the grid application pilot projects were funded by the Research Council responsible for each area of UK science funding.

The EPSRC funded 11 pilot e-Science projects in three phases (for about £3 million each in the first phase):

* First Phase (2001–2005) were CombEchem, DAME, Discovery Net, GEODISE, myGrid and RealityGrid.
* Second phase (2004–2008) were GOLD and Integrative biology
* Third phase (2005–2010) were PMSEG (MESSAGE), CARMEN and NanoCMOS

The PPARC/STFC funded two projects: GridPP (phase 1 for £17 million, phase 2 for £5.9 million, phase 3 for £30 million and a 4th phase running from 2011 to 2014) and Astrogrid (£14 million over 3 phases).

The remaining £23 million of phase one funding was divided between the application projects funded by BBSRC, MRC and NERC:

* BBSRC: Biomolecular Grid, Proteome Annotation Pipeline, High-Throughput Structural Biology, Global Biodiversity
* MRC: Biology of Ageing, Sequence and Structure Data, Molecular Genetics, Cancer Management, Clinical e-Science Framework, Neuroinformatics Modeling Tools
* NERC: Climateprediction.com, Oceanographic Grid, Molecular Environmental Grid, NERC DataGrid

The funded UK e-Science programme was reviewed on its completion in 2009 by an international panel led by Daniel E. Atkins, director of the Office of Cyberinfrastructure of the US NSF. The report concluded that the programme had developed a skilled pool of expertise, some services, and had led to cooperation between academia and industry, but that these achievements were at a project level rather than by generating infrastructure or transforming disciplines to adopt e-Science as a normal method of work, and that they were not self-sustainable without further investment.

=== United States===

United States-based initiatives, where the term cyberinfrastructure is typically used to define e-Science projects, are primarily funded by the National Science Foundation office of cyberinfrastructure (NSF OCI) and Department of Energy (in particular the Office of Science). After the conclusion of TeraGrid in 2011, the ACCESS program was established and funded by the National Science Foundation to help researchers and educators, with or without supporting grants, to utilize the nation’s advanced computing systems and services.

=== The Netherlands ===

Dutch eScience research is coordinated by the Netherlands eScience Center in Amsterdam, an initiative founded by NWO and SURF.

===Europe ===

Plan-Europe is a Platform of National e-Science/Data Research Centers in Europe, as established during the constituting meeting 29–30 October 2014 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and which is based on agreed Terms of Reference. PLAN-E has a kernel group of active members and convenes twice annually. More can be found on PLAN-E.

===Sweden ===

Two academic research projects have been carried out in Sweden by two different groups of universities, to help researches share and access scientific computing resources and knowledge:
* Swedish e-Science Research Center (SeRC): Kungliga Tekniska högskolan (KTH), Stockholm University (SU), Karolinska institutet (KI) and Linköping University (LiU)
* eSSENCE, The e-Science Collaboration (eSSENCE): Uppsala University, Lund University and Umeå University

== Comparison with traditional science ==
Traditional science is representative of two distinct philosophical traditions within the history of science, but e-Science, it is being argued, requires a paradigm shift, and the addition of a third branch of the sciences. &quot;The idea of open data is not a new one; indeed, when studying the history and philosophy of science, Robert Boyle is credited with stressing the concepts of skepticism, transparency, and reproducibility for independent verification in scholarly publishing in the 1660s. The scientific method later was divided into two major branches, deductive and empirical approaches. Today, a theoretical revision in the scientific method should include a new branch, Victoria Stodden advocate[s], that of the computational approach, where like the other two methods, all of the computational steps by which scientists draw conclusions are revealed. This is because within the last 20 years, people have been grappling with how to handle changes in high performance computing and simulation.&quot; As such, e-science aims at combining both empirical and theoretical traditions, while computer simulations can create artificial data, and real-time big data can be used to calibrate theoretical simulation models. Conceptually, e-Science revolves around developing new methods to support scientists in conducting scientific research with the aim of making new scientific discoveries by analyzing vast amounts of data accessible over the internet using vast amounts of computational resources. However, discoveries of value cannot be made simply by providing computational tools, a cyberinfrastructure or by performing a pre-defined set of steps to produce a result. Rather, there needs to be an original, creative aspect to the activity that by its nature cannot be automated. This has led to various research that attempts to define the properties that e-Science platforms should provide in order to support a new paradigm of doing science, and new rules to fulfill the requirements of preserving and making computational data results available in a manner such that they are reproducible in traceable, logical steps, as an intrinsic requirement for the maintenance of modern scientific integrity that allows an extenuation of &quot;Boyle&#x27;s tradition in the computational age&quot;.

=== Modelling e-Science processes ===
One view argues that since a modern discovery process instance serves a similar purpose to a mathematical proof it should have similar properties, namely it allows results to be deterministically reproduced when re-executed and that intermediate results can be viewed to aid examination and comprehension. In this case, simply modelling the provenance of data is not sufficient. One has to model the provenance of the hypotheses and results generated from analyzing the data as well so as to provide evidence that support new discoveries. Scientific workflows have thus been proposed and developed to assist scientists to track the evolution of their data, intermediate results and final results as a means to document and track the evolution of discoveries within a piece of scientific research.

=== Science 2.0 ===
Other views include Science 2.0 where e-Science is considered to be a shift from the publication of final results by well-defined collaborative groups towards a more open approach, which includes the public sharing of raw data, preliminary experimental results, and related information. To facilitate this shift, the Science 2.0 view is on providing tools that simplify communication, cooperation and collaboration between interested parties. Such an approach has the potential to: speed up the process of scientific discovery; overcome problems associated with academic publishing and peer review; and remove time and cost barriers, limiting the process of generating new knowledge.

<text>Yaser Esam Hamdi (; born September 26, 1980) is a former American citizen who was captured in Afghanistan in 2001. The United States government claims that he was fighting with the Taliban against U.S. and Afghan Northern Alliance forces. He was declared an &quot;illegal enemy combatant&quot; by the Bush administration and detained for almost three years without charge. On October 9, 2004, on the condition that he renounce his U.S. citizenship and commit to travel prohibitions and other conditions, the government released him and deported him to Saudi Arabia, where he had been raised.

Hamdi was initially detained at Camp X-Ray at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, along with eventually hundreds of other detainees. After officials learned that he was a U.S. citizen, Hamdi was transferred to military jails in Virginia and South Carolina. He continued to be detained without trial or legal representation.

Critics of his imprisonment claimed his civil rights were violated and that he was denied due process of law under the U.S. Constitution. They said his imprisonment without formal charges and denial of right to counsel was illegal.

On June 28, 2004, in &quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot;, the United States Supreme Court upheld the U.S. government&#x27;s ability to detain him indefinitely as an enemy combatant, but granted him some due process rights and the ability to contest his enemy combatant status. It said he had the right as a U.S. citizen to due process under &quot;habeas corpus&quot;: to confront his accusers and contest the grounds of detention in an impartial forum.

== Early years ==
According to his birth certificate, Hamdi was born to immigrant parents from Saudi Arabia in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on September 26, 1980.
As a child, he moved with his parents from the United States back to Saudi Arabia, where he grew up. The &quot;Charleston Post and Courier&quot; reported that Hamdi ran away from home during the summer of 2001, when he was 20 years old, and trained at a Taliban camp. His family said that he spent only a few weeks at the camp, &quot;where he quickly became disillusioned&quot;. He was caught up in the fighting and chaos after the United States invaded Afghanistan.

== Afghanistan ==
In late November 2001, after the United States invasion of Afghanistan, Hamdi was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in Kunduz, Afghanistan, along with hundreds of surrendering Taliban fighters. All the men were sent to the Qala-e-Jangi prison complex near Mazar-i-Sharif.

Among the surrendering Taliban forces, Afghan Arabs instigated a prison riot by detonating grenades they had concealed in their clothing, attacking Northern Alliance guards and seizing weapons. The prison uprising (known as the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi) was quashed after a six-day battle, which included heavy air support from U.S. AC-130 gunships and Black Hawk helicopters. One American (Johnny Micheal Spann) was killed and nine were injured, along with about 50 Northern Alliance soldiers. Between 200 and 400 Taliban prisoners were killed during the prison uprising. Two prisoners who were American citizens, Hamdi and John Walker Lindh, were among the survivors.

Hamdi surrendered on the second day of fighting with a group of 73 surviving prisoners, after Coalition forces began flooding the underground basements where the remaining prisoners had hidden themselves. The United States officer Matthew Campbell approached him, demanding to know his origin, to which Hamdi replied &quot;I was born in America... Baton Rouge, Louisiana, you know it, yeah?&quot;

The United States transported Hamdi to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and detained him there starting February 11, 2002. On April 5, the government transferred Hamdi to a jail at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia.

Armed with a federal appeals court finding, the Bush administration refused Hamdi a lawyer until December 2003. The Pentagon announced then that Hamdi would be allowed access to legal counsel because his &quot;intelligence value&quot; had been exhausted and that giving him a lawyer would not harm national security. The announcement said the decision &quot;should not be treated as a precedent&quot; for other cases in which the government had designated U.S. citizens as &quot;illegal enemy combatants&quot;. (José Padilla was then the only other U.S. citizen known to be imprisoned by the U.S. government as an &quot;illegal enemy combatant&quot;).

After the decision, Frank Dunham, Hamdi&#x27;s lawyer, was finally able to meet with him in February 2004, more than two years after he was incarcerated. Under Pentagon guidelines, military observers attended and recorded their meetings. Dunham was not allowed to discuss with Hamdi the conditions of his confinement. By this time, he had been transferred to the Navy Brig in Charleston, South Carolina. After the initial meeting, Hamdi was allowed to have confidential discussions with his attorneys without military observers, or video or audio taping in the room.

Hamdi&#x27;s father petitioned a federal court for Hamdi&#x27;s rights to know the crime(s) he is accused of, and to receive a fair trial before imprisonment. In January 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Hamdi&#x27;s case (&quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot;). It ruled that U.S. citizens were entitled to the basic rights of due process protections, and rejected the administration&#x27;s claim that its war-making powers overrode constitutional liberties.

== 2002 memos ==

On August 1, 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice issued a memo signed by Jay S. Bybee to John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency regarding authorized interrogation and detention techniques for the detainees in the war on terror. It approved ten &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; techniques including waterboarding.

Shortly after September 26, 2002, numerous senior government political appointees of the Bush administration flew to see the conditions of detention for Mohammed al-Kahtani and two United States citizens then held as enemy combatants: Jose Padilla and Hamdi, as a result of legal challenges to the government&#x27;s detention policy. The officials included the following:
*David Addington, legal counsel to Vice-president Dick Cheney;
*Alberto Gonzales, White House Counsel and later U.S. Attorney General;
*John A. Rizzo, Acting General Counsel of the CIA;
*William Haynes II, General Counsel of the Department of Defense;
*Jack Goldsmith, legal adviser to Haynes in the Office of General Counsel, DOD;
*Alice S. Fisher, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division, Department of Justice (DOJ), with responsibility for counter-terrorism efforts; and
*Patrick F. Philbin, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, DOJ, who had helped develop policy related to Bush&#x27;s use of military commissions to review detainees&#x27; cases;

They first flew to Camp Delta at Guantanamo to see the detainee al-Kahtani. They traveled next to Charleston, South Carolina, to view Padilla, held at the Naval Brig, and finally to Norfolk, Virginia, to view Hamdi, who was still being detained at that Naval brig.

Upon seeing Hamdi curled up in fetal position in his cell, Goldsmith wrote, &quot;it seemed unnecessary to hold a twenty-two year old foot soldier in a remote wing of a run-down prison in a tiny cell, isolated from almost all human contact, and with no access to a lawyer&quot;.

In 2008, 91 pages of memos drafted in 2002 by officers at the Naval Consolidated Brig, Charleston, were made public under an FOIA petition. As reported by news outlets, the emails and memos described the officers&#x27; concerns for the sanity of the detainees due to the conditions of their confinements at the time, which included extended solitary confinement. The memos indicate that officers were concerned at the time that the isolation and lack of stimuli was severely affecting the mental health of Hamdi, Padilla and Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, another U.S. detainee.

== U.S. Supreme Court &quot;amici curiae&quot; briefs ==
Twelve U.S. Supreme Court &quot;amici curiae&quot; briefs were filed in the &quot;Hamdi&quot; case, including nine on behalf of Hamdi and three in support of the government. Supporters of the U.S. government&#x27;s position included the American Center for Law and Justice; Citizens for the Common Defence; filing jointly, the Washington Legal Foundation, U.S. Representatives Joe Barton (R–Tex.), Walter Jones (R–N.C.), and Lamar Smith (R–Tex.), and Allied Educational Foundation ; and, also filing jointly, the Center for American Unity, Friends of Immigration Law Enforcement, National Center on Citizenship and Immigration, and U.S. Representatives Dana Rohrabacher (R–Calif.), Lamar Smith, Tom Tancredo (R–Colo.), Roscoe Bartlett (R–Md.), Mac Collins (R–Ga.), Joe Barton, and Jimmy Duncan (R–Tenn.).

Some government supporters argued that he had renounced his citizenship by virtue of enlisting in a foreign army. The Center for American Unity&#x27;s brief argued that Hamdi was never a United States citizen, despite his birth in the United States. They argued that the policy of birthright citizenship is based on a flawed interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

On the other side, the American Bar Association; American Civil Liberties Union, American Jewish Committee, Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, and Union for Reform Judaism filing jointly; the Cato Institute; Experts on the Law of War; Certain Former Prisoners of War; Global Rights; Hon. Nathaniel R. Jones, Hon. Abner J. Mikva, Hon. William A. Norris, Hon. H. Lee Sarokin, Hon. Herbert J. Stern, Hon. Harold R. Tyler, Jr., Scott Greathead, Robert M. Pennoyer, and Barbara Paul Robinson filing jointly; International Humanitarian Organizations and Associations of International Journalists filing jointly; and a group of international law professors filing jointly submitted &quot;amici curiae&quot; briefs to the court on behalf of Hamdi.

Opponents of the U.S. government&#x27;s detention without trial of U.S. citizens argued that the practice violated numerous constitutional safeguards and protections, as well as international conventions to which the United States is a signatory.

== U.S. Supreme Court decision ==
On June 28, 2004, the Supreme Court issued a decision repudiating the U.S. government&#x27;s unilateral assertion of executive authority to suspend constitutional protections of individual liberty.

&quot;An interrogation by one&#x27;s captor, however effective an intelligence-gathering tool, hardly constitutes a constitutionally adequate fact-finding before a neutral decision-maker&quot;, wrote Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor.

The U.S. Supreme Court opinion reasserted the rule of law in American society: &quot;It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments that our nation&#x27;s commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which we fight abroad.&quot; She added that the Court had &quot;long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the nation&#x27;s citizens&quot;.

The Supreme Court decision in &quot;Hamdi&quot; did not say that the government could not detain enemy combatants; it can detain enemy combatants for the length of hostilities. However, they must be given some sort of due process to determine their status as an enemy combatant. Although the United States Congress has recognized the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, the Pentagon&#x27;s administrative procedure, the Supreme Court did not recognize it as due process.

== Legal significance ==
The Hamdi decision reaffirmed the importance of separation of powers among the branches of the government, and, in particular, the role of the judiciary in reviewing actions of the executive branch infringing the rights of citizens even in emergencies. After the American Civil War, the Supreme Court prohibited military detention of noncombatant Americans without appeal or writ of habeas corpus as long as courts were functioning; the difference with this case being that the Supreme Court waited until the war was over to decide the case. A 1948 federal law condemned the detention of Japanese-Americans without legal recourse during World War II; it prohibited the imprisonment of American citizens except pursuant to an act of Congress.

The Bush administration claimed that U.S. law does not apply to &quot;illegal enemy combatants&quot; and that it asserted the right to decide which U.S. citizens are &quot;enemy combatants&quot;, ineligible for protection of their rights as enshrined in the United States Constitution.

Some legal scholars hailed the Supreme Court decision as the most important civil rights opinion in a half-century. They said that it was a dramatic reversal of the sweeping authority asserted by President Bush since the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Other scholars, however, believe the Supreme Court imprudently enhanced the Executive&#x27;s power. The Supreme Court allowed the Executive to unilaterally determine that Hamdi was an enemy combatant. Further, the Supreme Court determined that the Executive was not required to provide any process when making the enemy combatant classification. The Supreme Court&#x27;s only requirement was that a person classified as an enemy combatant must be provided with minimal due process. In effect, this allowed the Executive branch to lower the due process requirements on an American citizen, solely because the Executive branch claimed he was an enemy combatant.

Assessing the Hamdi decision, Habeas Corpus scholar Jared Perkins noted &quot;By ratifying in part and &#x27;fixing&#x27; (as Justice Scalia put it) in part the executive&#x27;s action against Hamdi, the plurality participated with the executive in the usurpation of Congress&#x27;s power to define the curtailment of the public&#x27;s liberties. Removing this power (and, more importantly, this responsibility) from the representatives of the people seriously undermines those structural protections that Madison and others saw as the fundamental barrier to tyranny. &quot;

== Release ==
After agreeing to renounce his U.S. citizenship, Hamdi was released on October 9, 2004, without being charged and was deported to Saudi Arabia. He had to promise to comply with strict travel restrictions, which prohibited him from traveling to the United States, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Hamdi was required to notify Saudi Arabian officials if he ever plans to leave the kingdom. (Saudi Arabia uses exit visas and presumably this is how American authorities can track him if he leaves the country.) He had to promise not to sue the U.S. government over his captivity.

Saudi Arabia subsequently imprisoned Hamdi in Dammam for eight years and Ha&#x27;ir for seven years; he is due to be released in 2022. At Ha&#x27;ir he became a media specialist with the prisoner-run enterprise.

Although Hamdi renounced his U.S. citizenship, it is unclear whether the renunciation counts as &quot;voluntary&quot;, as required by the Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions in &quot;Afroyim v. Rusk&quot; and &quot;Vance v. Terrazas.&quot;

<text>The Open Digital Rights Language (&quot;ODRL&quot;) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. ODRL became an endorsed W3C Recommendation in 2018.

An example of ODRL policy follows, which can be simply interpreted as &quot;John Doe can Play the asset mysong.mp3&quot;.
{
 &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld&quot;,
 &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;http://example.com/policy#001&quot;,
 &quot;permission&quot;: [{
 &quot;target&quot;: &quot;http://example.com/mysong.mp3&quot;,
 &quot;assignee&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
 &quot;action&quot;: &quot;play&quot;
}
==ODRL History==
ODRL was initially created in 2000, to address the burgeoning needs of the digital rights management (DRM) sector when media players were first introduced to the marketplace. Version 1.1 of the ODRL language was quickly adopted by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) as their core standard for mobile media content protections and for managing digital objects. To date, ODRL is arguably the largest mobile implementation of a rights language, currently operating on over a billion compatible devices.

ODRL was managed by an independent Initiative, hosted by IPR Systems and led by Renato Iannella, before becoming a W3C Community Group in 2011. This move has provided long-term stability of the specifications and a transparent governance model.

In 2013, two new media sectors adopted ODRL: the eBook publishing and news industries. The International Press and Telecommunication Council (IPTC) news consortium adopted ODRL for the communication of usage policies, primarily in association with the licensed distribution and use of news content in the online news marketplace.

In the current virtual goods environment, content assets purchased or permissioned by a consumer are often locked into the same platform where content was initially consumed due to interoperability of rights expressions across platforms. ODRL Version 2.0 recognized it is equally important to state Permissions and Prohibitions in an expression language representing both DRM and non-DRM digital objects, broad adoption of this advanced model can reduce friction across digital devices and enable transparent transactions between machines in accordance with the specified policy language.

ODRL policy model framework currently supports traditional rights expressions for commercial transactions, open access expressions, and privacy expressions for social media.

==ODRL Specifications and Profiles==
ODRL is specified in two World Wide Web (W3C) Recommendations published in February 2018:
* ODRL Information Model 2.2
* ODRL Vocabulary &amp; Expression 2.2

Included within the ODRL documentation are a number of basic use cases demonstrating how to implement policy expressions using the Core Model with terms from the Common Vocabulary. ODRL is fully extensible and provides a mechanism for new communities to extend and/or deprecate the ODRL Common Vocabulary used in conjunction with the Core Model.

An example of how the ODRL Profile and Vocabulary may be extended is found in the IPTC RightsML profile. The robust framework of ODRL allows for a wide variety of business models to be expressed and to address the requirements of multiple communities, such as social networks, publishers, image libraries, and education. Other profiles, such as the ODRL profile of Creative Commons were developed.

The ODRL Community Group is a World Wide Web (W3C) Community Group still supports the promotion and future development of the W3C ODRL recommendations.

Other W3C Community Groups have adopted ODRL as the core Policy language and have developed a Profile to meet their community requirements, such as the Rights Automation for Market Data Community Group for pricing and trading data for financial instruments.

==ODRL Core Model==
In the ODRL Core Model, the Policy is the central entity that holds an ODRL policy together. In its encoded form, e.g. in a JSON or XML document, it makes the policy addressable from the outside world via its unique UID attribute. A policy can refer to multiple permissions, duties and prohibitions.

A Permission allows a particular Action to be executed on a related Asset, e.g. “play the audio file abc.mp3″. A Constraint like “at most 10 times” might be added to specify the Permission more precisely. The Party that grants this Permission is linked to it with the Role assigner, the Party that is granted the Permission is linked to it with the Role assignee, e.g. “assigner VirtualMusicShop grants the Permission to assignee Alice”. Additionally, a Permission may be linked to Duty entities that means there are obligations on the assigner to fulfil in order to exercise the permission.

Similar to Permissions, a Duty states that a certain Action may be executed by the Party with the Role assignee for the Permission to be valid, e.g. “Alice must pay 5 EUR in order to get the Permission to play abc.mp3″. 
The Prohibition entity is used in the same way as Permission, with the key difference that it forbids the Action, e.g. “Alice is forbidden to use abc.mp3 commercially”.

==ODRL Vocabulary==
The ODRL Core Vocabulary defines the semantics for the concepts and terms from the ODRL Information Model. The ODRL Core Vocabulary represents the minimally supported terms for ODRL Policies.

In addition, the ODRL Common Vocabulary defines semantics for generic terms that may be optionally used in ODRL Profiles by communities.

==ODRL Encodings==
ODRL can be implemented in three serializations: JSON, XML, and Turtle. Communities adopting ODRL can use standardized actions for Permissions, Prohibitions, and Duties that are expressed in policy statements.

<text>Bedford (pop. 36,354 ) is a former town and now a district of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is situated on the north west shore of the Bedford Basin in the central area of the municipality. It borders the neighbouring communities of Hammonds Plains to the west, Sackville to the north, Dartmouth to the east, and mainland Halifax to the south. Bedford was named in honour of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, Secretary of State for the colonies in 1749.

==History==

The area of Bedford has evidence of Indigenous peoples dating back thousands of years. Petroglyphs are found at Bedford Petroglyphs National Historic Site. The Bedford area is known as Kwipek to the Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nation.
On 21 July 1749, Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports. The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against the Acadians, the French, and the Mi&#x27;kmaq, British fortifications were erected in Halifax (1749), Bedford (Fort Sackville) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), Lunenburg (1753) and Lawrencetown (1754).

The history of Bedford began when Governor Edward Cornwallis organised his men and began the construction of a road leading to Minas Basin on the Bay of Fundy after establishing the garrison at Halifax. To protect it, he hired John Gorham and his Rangers to erect a fort on the shore of Bedford Basin. It was named Fort Sackville after Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset. The area around the fort became known as Sackville until the mid-1850s, when it became Bedford.

In 1752, among the first to receive a large land grant was military officer George Scott in the Fort Sackville area. Scott later participated in the Expulsion of the Acadians, specifically the St. John River Campaign (1758). His brother, Joseph, was paymaster at the Halifax Garrison in the 1760s, received two grants in 1759 and 1765. And built Scott Manor House in 1770.

Anthony Holland established the Acadian Paper Mill on the Basin around 1819 to provide paper to produce the Halifax newspaper Acadian Recorder.

When the railway went through the station named Millview, the Moirs, Son and Co. moved a part of the Moirs Mill factory to Bedford. The Moirs Mill generating station built in the early 1930s to supply the necessary electricity required to run the factory.
On 1 July 1980, Bedford was incorporated as a town. The Town only had two Mayors from 1 July 1980 until 1 April 1996; the first Mayor of Bedford was Francene Cosman. The second and final Mayor of Bedford was Peter J. Kelly. Peter J. Kelly would later serve as Mayor of the Municipality of Halifax, from 2000 to 2012.

On 1 April 1996, Halifax County was dissolved and all of its places (cities, suburbs, towns, and villages) were turned into communities of a single-tier municipality named &quot;Halifax Regional Municipality&quot;. Subsequently, Bedford was turned into a community within the new Municipality of Halifax.

==Geography==
Bedford is approximately from Downtown Halifax. Bedford covers 3,979 hectares (39.79 km2) of land area. As Bedford is quite centralized in the municipality its borders are formed by the community boundaries it shares with its neighbours. To the north are the communities of Lower Sackville, Lakeview and Waverley and Dartmouth are to the east, Halifax and Timberlea to the south and finally Hammonds Plains to the west.

Topographically, the area is situated over bedrock, with a high proportion of rockland and exposed bedrock ridges, dotted with many lakes and wetlands. In these ridge terrains, soils are typically dry, shallow, and coarse, and often degraded by a history of repeated wildfire.

Bedford has several large lakes including: Marsh Lake, Sandy Lake, Kearney Lake and Paper Mill Lake, the latter being the secondary tributary of the Bedford Basin.

The main tributary of the Bedford Basin estuary is the Sackville River. The river has been heavily affected by ongoing development within its watershed and a chronic loss of riparian zones along its shores, especially in downtown Bedford, where the impervious surfaces of shopping centres and strip malls dominate the landscape. The secondary tributary of the Basin flows Paper Mill Lake then through Moirs Mill Pond adjacent to a commercial shopping district at the intersection of the Bedford Highway and Hammonds Plains Road. Both areas are composed almost entirely of impervious surfaces where contaminated stormwater and surface runoff are unable to permeate into the ground and instead flow directly into the Bedford Basin. 

The developed area of Bedford’s shore line is mainly long the Bedford Bay portion of the basin. It consists of a public waterfront boardwalk through a 1 km portion of DeWolf Park and follows along to Lions Park and along Shore Drive. Its eastern shore consists of a &quot;blast buffer zone&quot; that surrounds Canadian Forces Ammunition Depot Bedford; this is the Royal Canadian Navy’s weapons magazine for its Atlantic fleet.

==Culture==
===Recreation===
There is a popular walkway along much of the Bedford Basin waterfront that begins at DeWolf park, and continues as the Bedford-Sackville Connector Greenway, a crushed gravel covered trail that meanders along the Sackville River.

On Shore Drive, there is an outdoor 25-metre pool and smaller splash pool located at Lions Park, and in the summer there are numerous lakes suitable for swimming.

Bedford is a well-established sailing community, and is home to the Bedford Basin Yacht Club and Marina.

===Sports===
The community is currently home to six ice surfaces, at the BMO Centre, Lebrun Centre, and the Gary Martin Dome.

The topography of the area limits the possible locations for football-and-soccer fields. However, there are fields at Basinview Drive Community School, Bedford South School, Charles P. Allen High School, Range Park, Rocky Lake Junior High, and Sunnyside Elementary (Eaglewood location).

===Traditions===
Bedford Days has occurred annually at the end of June and beginning of July for almost 50 years. Currently, most of the events take place at DeWolf Park. There is an opening celebration, a Canada Day celebration, free pancake-breakfast, dog show, Kids&#x27; Extravaganza, Kids&#x27; Triathlon, Movies in the Park, the Rubber Duck Dash, and the Scott Manor House Tea Party.

The Light Up Bedford Parade is an annual parade that has been held since 1998 and takes place on the Sunday following the Light Up Halifax Parade, which usually is mid-November. It runs along the Bedford Highway from Bedford Place Mall and ends at DeWolf Park. At the park there is Christmas carol singing, contests-and-prizes, and a hot chocolate stand. At the conclusion of the parade, a Christmas Tree is lit. In addition to bringing the community together to celebrate the beginning of the Christmas season, the parade serves as a fundraiser for the Turkey Club Society—which raises funds to ensure residents of Municipality of Halifax are able to provide a Christmas dinner for their families.

==Demographics==
Although a well-established community, Bedford has not had demographic information released from the 2006, 2011, 2016, and the 2021 Canadian Censuses.

==Transportation==
Bedford has many different modes of transport for the inhabitants of the community. Cycling paths, footpaths, sidewalks give many options.

There are highways-and-roads for motorists, but Bedford&#x27;s network (like all of the built-up area of Halifax) sees traffic congestion on these roads during the many peak hours. The section of the Bedford Highway is notorious for slow speeds at morning-and-evening peak hours.

Halifax Transit provides services to the community of Bedford. Many routes give access to places within the urban agglomeration of Halifax, and some routes give access to places outside of the urban agglomeration.

Recently, there have been several different modes of public-transportation proposed within Halifax to support its current and continued growth. There is a fast ferry service planned for the Mill Cove area that would connect to the Ferry Terminal in Downtown Halifax. Furthermore, there have been proposals to re-introduce Commuter (Light) Rail within Halifax&#x27;s urban area. However, these proposed services are controversial due to disputes over projected costs and ridership levels.

===Public transit===
 &quot;Wheelchair – Uses Accessible Low Floor (ALF) buses only.&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;Rush Hour Service Only&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;Designated Bike Route&quot;&lt;br&gt;

<doc id="1001992" wikidata="Q7337197" url="?curid=1001992" title="River Burn, Norfolk">
<text>The River Burn (also known as &quot;Nelsons River&quot;) is a river in the northwest of the County of Norfolk, in the East of England. From its source to its mouth on the North Coast of Norfolk it is . The river has a fall of 36 metres to the sea.

==Course==
The source is one mile south of the village of South Creake, in a small copse west of a bend in London Lane. From the source it runs northeast towards the village of South Creake, where at Fakenham road it turns northwest and run through the village. Gradually the river turns north and runs along the western side of the Burnham road heading towards North Creake.

The river runs through the village of North Creake, crosses under the Burnham Road and heads north across the open countryside towards the ruins of Creake Abbey. This abbey is on the southern edge of the Burnham’s, a mile or so from Burnham Thorpe. It was built towards the end of the 14th century for an Augustinian priory which had inhabited this spot since the 1220s, becoming an abbey shortly afterwards. Creake Abbey is unusual, because although it survived into the 16th century, it never suffered the effects of the Reformation or the dissolution of the monasteries. In 1508, an outbreak of plague killed virtually all the inhabitants, and it was abandoned.

The river runs through a small pool in what were the grounds on the west side of the abbey, and then passes under the lane and out northwards across countryside towards Burnham Thorpe. At Burnham Thorpe the river runs through another pool very close to the site of the Burnham Thorpe Parsonage. That parsonage was the birthplace of Admiral Horatio Nelson. Burnham Thorpe was originally one of a group of seven villages all prefixed with &quot;Burnham&quot; taking their name from the river. It is approximately three miles from the North Norfolk coast, a low, flat coastline of muted colour, of sand and salt-marsh. From the high ground above the village one can see the sea, and it is said that from there you can hear the sound of surf on the sand of the shore.

The river now curves northwest through the village towards Thorpe common. The Manor House on Thorpe common has a moat all around supplied with water from the river. Further on the river passes under the route of the dismantled West Norfolk Junction Railway to the east of Burnham Market. From here the river widens a little and flows into the mill pond at Burnham Overy. Burnham Overy Union mill is one of only two mills in Norfolk to use both water and wind power from the same site. The watermill section had 3 pairs of stones, and the windmill had a further 2 pairs. Both mills were built in 1737, being constructed of brick, the watermill having two storeys under a Norfolk pan tiled roof, with a third storey being added later. The windmill was originally built with five floors, but a sixth was subsequently added. In 1825 the sails had copper vanes.

Just a very short distance on the river reaches a second watermill. The lower mill at Burnham Overy is the second of two watermills on the river Burn. This mill consists of a long row of buildings in four sections, three storeys high, built from local red brick with pantile roofs; it was originally three stories high, but after it burnt down in the 1940s Christopher Curtis Green (son of William Curtis Green who lives in the Mill House re-drew it for it to be re-built with a less overbearing two stories, as it stands today. The mill dates from 1795. The inlet water bridge is in between the second and third building. The A149 coast road passes over the river at the mill site.

From here the river enters Overy marshes and Overy Creek. The river spreads out into multiple tidal creeks through the salt marshes that fringe the coast thereabouts, and finally leaves land and enters the sea between the eastern point of Scolt Head Island and Overy Marshes, the gap locally known as Burnham Harbour. Small boats can reach Burnham Overy Staithe through this gap and creek.

<text>Suresh Kalmadi (born 1 May 1944) is an Indian politician and senior sports administrator. He is a former member of the Indian National Congress. He was a member of parliament from Pune until May 2014. He is alleged to have been involved in corrupt practices in relation to the 2010 Commonwealth Games during his tenure as president of Indian Olympic Association and chairman of Commonwealth Games 2010. He was charged with conspiracy, forgery, misconduct and under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and later arrested for the same in April 2014, but has not yet faced trial. In December 2016, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) named Suresh Kalmadi as its lifetime patron. However, he refused to accept the post until he was able to clear his name.

== Early life ==
Kalmadi was born to Mangalore-based Dr. K. Shamrao Kalmadi and Shanta Rao Kalmadi. He speaks Konkani, Kannada, Marathi, English, Hindi and Tulu language. He was educated at St. Vincent&#x27;s High School and Fergusson College, Pune. Kalmadi joined the National Defence Academy in 1960 and was commissioned as a pilot in the Indian Air Force, serving between 1964 and 1972. He then became an instructor with the Air Force Training Team of the NDA from 1972 to 1974 before retiring from the IAF as a squadron leader.

He is married to Meera Kalmadi. The couple have two daughters and one son.

==Political career==
In 1977, Kalmadi became the president of the Indian Youth Congress, Pune, and the next year took over President-ship of the Youth Congress, Maharashtra, a post he held from 1978 to 1980. In 1980, as the president of the Maharashtra Athletics Association, Kalmadi undertook the selection trials for the Marathon team to represent the country at the Moscow Olympics. This soon led to the establishment of the Pune International Marathon.

Kalmadi served as president of the Indian Youth Congress (Socialist) 19811986.

He was a member of the Rajya Sabha for three terms from 1982 to 1996, and again in 1998.

Kalmadi took over as the Chairman of the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation and in 1989 started the Pune Festival.

He was also elected to the 11th Lok Sabha in 1996, and to the 14th Lok Sabha in 2004. During the tenure of P. V. Narasimha Rao as the Prime Minister of India, Suresh Kalmadi served as the Minister of State for Railways from 1995 to 1996. That year he presented the Railway Budget.

Kalmadi served as the president of the Indian Olympic Association from 1996 to 2012. He also served as the president of Asian Athletics Association from 2000 to 2013 and was named its &quot;Life President&quot; in 2015.

==Controversies==

===Corruption related to Formula One 2011===
Kalmadi, as the Indian Olympic Association, signed an agreement to bring the Formula One Grand Prix to India in 2007. Later that year, the UK-based organizers Formula One Administration Limited signed a contract in this regard with India-based JPSK Sports Private Limited. Records obtained by &quot;The Indian Express&quot; showed that Pune-based Sulba Realty Private Limited was a 13% shareholder in JPSK, along with Jaypee Group (74%). Kalmadi&#x27;s son Sumeer was a director in Sulba Realty at the time, which would have implied a conflict of interest. While the JP in JPSK stood for Jaypee Group, it was alleged that the SK was a reference to Suresh/Sumeer Kalmadi. Records from the Registrar of Companies, India showed that a year after the company was floated, Kalmadi&#x27;s daughter, Payal Aditya Bhartia, and his son-in-law, Aditya Bhartia, joined JPSK as independent directors.

===Commonwealth Games 2010===

Kalmadi&#x27;s conduct around the 2010 Commonwealth Games came under scrutiny, with the Central Vigilance Commission (India&#x27;s anti-corruption organisation) asking the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe certain aspects of the games&#x27; organisation.
For this, the opposition demanded Kalmadi&#x27;s resignation.

On 2 August 2010, Suresh Kalmadi had bought hundreds of Air Conditioners for ₹4,00,000 and treadmills for ₹9,00,000 for the Commonwealth games and the sports facilities of Indian players. Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) blames agencies under the Delhi government and the sports ministry for large-scale procedural violations and corruption.

On 25 April 2011, CBI arrested former CWG Organising Committee (OC) chairman Suresh Kalmadi in the Timing-Scoring-Result (TSR) case. He was arrested under Sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.

On 20 May 2011, CBI filed the first chargesheet in a special CBI court against Kalmadi. The CBI alleged that he was the main accused in awarding TSR system contract to a Swiss firm. The charge sheet said, &quot;Kalmadi is the main accused as he was the person with all supreme powers. He had the supreme over-riding powers in the Organising Committee of the CWG, 2010.&quot; In addition to Kalmadi, the CBI named two companies and eight persons including OC former Secretary General Lalit Bhanot and former Director General VK Verma as accused.

Kalmadi&#x27;s membership of the Indian National Congress Party was suspended after being arrested and charged with corruption. On 26 April 2011 he was sacked from the post of president of the Indian Olympic Association. On 1 July 2013 he lost the election for the post of president of the Asian Athletics Association, a post which he had held for 13 consecutive years, losing to Qatar&#x27;s Dahlan Jumaan Al-Hamad.

Suresh Kalmadi was in jail for 10 months and the court asked him to pay a surety amount of .
Kalmadi was allowed by a Delhi court on 13 July 2012 to go to London for 2012 Olympics. He was, however, restrained on 25 July 2012 by the Delhi High court from participating in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics, saying his participation can cause &quot;embarrassment&quot; to the nation.

He claimed to be suffering from dementia during course of investigation while in Tihar jail. Medical tests were not conclusive to be able to prove his claim.

<text>Day and Night is a cellular automaton rule in the same family as Game of Life. It is defined by rule notation B3678/S34678, meaning that a dead cell becomes live (is born) if it has 3, 6, 7, or 8 live neighbors, and a live cell remains alive (survives) if it has 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8 live neighbors, out of the eight neighbors in the Moore neighborhood. It was invented and named by Nathan Thompson in 1997, and investigated extensively by David I. Bell. The rule is given the name &quot;Day &amp; Night&quot; because its &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; states are symmetric: if all the cells in the Universe are inverted, the future states are the inversions of the future states of the original pattern. A pattern in which the entire universe consists of &quot;off&quot; cells except for finitely many &quot;on&quot; cells can equivalently be represented by a pattern in which the whole universe is covered in &quot;on&quot; cells except for finitely many &quot;off&quot; cells in congruent locations.

Although the detailed evolution of this cellular automaton is very different from Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, it exhibits complex behavior similar to that rule: there are many known small &quot;oscillators&quot; and &quot;spaceships&quot;, and &quot;guns&quot; formed by combining oscillators in such a way that they periodically emit spaceships of various types.

<doc id="1002030" wikidata="Q4752920" url="?curid=1002030" title="Ancient Tenements">
<text>The Ancient Tenements are the oldest surviving farms in Dartmoor, England, established during the 14th century and possibly earlier.

In Mediaeval Britain, grazing rights within the boundaries of the Forest of Dartmoor were strictly limited. However a few settlers were permitted to build farms there, and to release their livestock on surrounding land. These farms became known as the Ancient Tenements, and many still survive today, such as Babeny, Bellever, Brimpts, Brownberry, Dunnabridge, Dury, Hartyland, Hexworthy, Huccaby, Lakehead, Merripit, Pizwell, Prince Hall, Riddon, Runnage, and Sherberton.

Many still feature buildings that are of mediaeval origins, including elements of their original longhouses:

*Bellever&#x27;s medieval longhouse was demolished only last century when today&#x27;s farmhouse was built.
*Dunnabridge grew to become a cluster of small farms. Several of today&#x27;s barns show signs of chimneys - evidence that they were once inhabited.
*Dury Farm has an ancient fireplace and a flight of granite stairs winding around the chimney stack.
*Pizwell features a 16th-century door and fireplace.
*Prince Hall (once known as Prynse Hall), is now a hotel and restaurant which stands on the site of the original farm.
*Riddon (originally Riddam) no longer has its original longhouse, although it does feature an ancient granite barn.
*Sherrill (often recorded as Sherwell) is a small hamlet containing a number of farm buildings and cottages. The farm still features its original longhouse, virtually intact, but now used as a barn, with a large porch constructed from slabs of granite.

The majority are Grade II listed and some are Grade II* (particularly important buildings of special interest).

For centuries, these settlements were isolated from &#x27;civilisation&#x27; - many miles from the nearest villages. And yet the inhabitants were still expected to travel many miles to church each Sunday, over hills and rough terrain. To make matters worse, the parish boundaries often bore little or no relation to the natural geography. However, in 1260, the Bishop decreed that the dead from Pizwell and neighbouring Babeny, could be taken to Widecombe-in-the-Moor, which was much closer and more accessible.

<doc id="1002036" wikidata="Q3399796" url="?curid=1002036" title="Onion Johnny">
<text>Onion Johnnies ( or ) were Breton farmers and agricultural labourers who travelled, originally on foot and later on bicycles, selling distinctive pink onions door to door in Great Britain. They were especially active in Wales, where they share linguistic similarities.

They adapted this nickname for themselves in Breton as &quot;ar Johniged&quot; or &quot;ar Johnniged&quot;.

Declining since the 1950s to only a few, the Onion Johnny was once very common. Dressed in striped Breton shirt and beret, riding a bicycle hung with onions, the Onion Johnny became the stereotypical image of the Frenchman in the United Kingdom. In many cases these tradesmen may have been the only contact that ordinary British people had with France and French people.

With renewed interest since the late 1990s by farmers and the public in small-scale agriculture, the number of Onion Johnnies have recently made a small recovery. 

==History==

The trade may have begun in 1828 when the first successful trip is said to have been made by Henri Ollivier. From the area around Roscoff in Brittany known as &quot;Bro Rosko&quot;, Johnnies found a more profitable market in Britain than in France. They typically took their harvest across the English Channel in July to store in rented barns, returning home in December or January. They could have sold their produce in Paris, but the roads and the railways were bad in the 19th century and going there was a long and difficult trip. Crossing the Channel was shorter and easier. 

As the early Johnnies were all Breton-speakers, Wales was a favoured destination. Breton is a Brythonic language related to Welsh and Cornish, and the Johnnies would have found Welsh a far easier language to learn than English. The Johnnies who regularly visited Wales in the nineteenth century became known as &quot;&quot; and subsequently as &quot;Onion Johnnies&quot; in English.

The golden age for Johnnies across the UK was during the 1920s; in 1929 nearly 1,400 Johnnies exported more than 9,000 tonnes of onions to the UK. The Great Depression, followed by the devaluation of the Pound in the early 1930s, ended the era. Trade suddenly fell, reaching a low in 1934, when fewer than 400 people imported under 3,000 tonnes.

In the aftermath of World War II, in common with other goods, onions were subject to import restrictions in the UK and had to be traded through a single company. By 1973 the number of Johnnies had dropped to 160, trading 1,100 tonnes. By the end of the 20th century, the number of Johnnies fell to around 20. By 2008, reportedly only 15 Johnnies remained, and by 2022, with travel restrictions caused by Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic, the profession was &quot;wiped out&quot;.

The Channel crossings Journeys are now made by ferry, but small sailing ships and steamers were used previously. The crossing could be hazardous. Seventy Johnnies died when the steamer SS &quot;Hilda&quot; sank at Saint-Malo in 1905.

==In culture==
The Onion Johnny museum opened in Roscoff in 2004, with a two-day Fête de l&#x27;Oignon (Onion Festival) that has since been held every summer. Since 2009 the &quot;&quot; has been protected under the French &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; designation.

<text>Robert William Taylor (February 10, 1932 – April 13, 2017), known as Bob Taylor, was an American Internet pioneer, who led teams that made major contributions to the personal computer, and other related technologies. He was director of ARPA&#x27;s Information Processing Techniques Office from 1965 through 1969, founder and later manager of Xerox PARC&#x27;s Computer Science Laboratory from 1970 through 1983, and founder and manager of Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Systems Research Center until 1996.

Uniquely, Taylor had no formal academic training or research experience in computer science; Severo Ornstein likened Taylor to a &quot;concert pianist without fingers&quot;, a perception reaffirmed by historian Leslie Berlin: &quot;Taylor could hear a faint melody in the distance, but he could not play it himself. He knew whether to move up or down the scale to approximate the sound, he could recognize when a note was wrong, but he needed someone else to make the music.&quot;

His awards include the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and the Draper Prize. Taylor was known for his high-level vision: &quot;The Internet is not about technology; it&#x27;s about communication. The Internet connects people who have shared interests, ideas and needs, regardless of geography.&quot;

==Early life==
Robert W. Taylor was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1932. His adoptive father, Rev. Raymond Taylor, was a Methodist minister who held degrees from Southern Methodist University, the University of Texas at Austin and Yale Divinity School. The family (including Taylor&#x27;s adoptive mother, Audrey) was highly itinerant during Taylor&#x27;s childhood, moving from parish to parish. Having skipped several grades as a result of his enrollment in an experimental school, he began his higher education at Southern Methodist University at the age of 16 in 1948; while there, he was &quot;not a serious student&quot; but &quot;had a good time.&quot;

Taylor then served a stint in the United States Naval Reserve during the Korean War (1952–1954) at Naval Air Station Dallas before returning to his studies at the University of Texas at Austin under the GI Bill. At UT he was a &quot;professional student,&quot; taking courses for pleasure. In 1957, he earned an undergraduate degree in experimental psychology from the institution with minors in mathematics, philosophy, English and religion.

He subsequently earned a master&#x27;s degree in psychology from Texas in 1959 before electing not to pursue a PhD in the field. Reflecting his background in experimental psychology and mathematics, he completed research in neuroscience, psychoacoustics and the auditory nervous system as a graduate student. According to Taylor, &quot;I had a teaching assistantship in the department, and they were urging me to get a PhD, but to get a PhD in psychology in those days, maybe still today, you have to qualify and take courses in abnormal psychology, social psychology, clinical psychology, child psychology, none of which I was interested in. Those are all sort of in the softer regions of psychology. They&#x27;re not very scientific, they&#x27;re not very rigorous. I was interested in physiological psychology, in psychoacoustics or the portion of psychology which deals with science, the nervous system, things that are more like applied physics and biology, really, than they are what normally people think of when they think of psychology. So I didn&#x27;t want to waste time taking courses in those other areas and so I said I&#x27;m not going to get a PhD.&quot;

After leaving Texas, Taylor taught math and coached basketball for a year at Howey Academy, a co-ed prep school in Florida. &quot;I had a wonderful time but was very poor, with a second child — who turned out to be twins — on the way,&quot; he recalled.

Taylor took engineering jobs with aircraft companies at better salaries. He helped to design the MGM-31 Pershing as a senior systems engineer for defense contractor Martin Marietta (1960–1961) in Orlando, Florida.

In 1962, after submitting a research proposal for a flight control simulation display, he was invited to join NASA&#x27;s Office of Advanced Research and Technology as a program manager assigned to the crewed flight control and display division.

==Computer career==
Taylor worked for NASA in Washington, D.C. while the Kennedy administration was backing research and development projects such as the Apollo program for a crewed moon landing. In late 1962 Taylor met J. C. R. Licklider, who was heading the new Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense. Like Taylor, Licklider had specialized in psychoacoustics during his graduate studies. In March 1960, he published “Man-Computer Symbiosis”, an article that envisioned new ways to use computers. This work was an influential roadmap in the history of the internet and the personal computer, and greatly influenced Taylor.

During this period, Taylor also became acquainted with Douglas Engelbart at the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California. He directed NASA funding to Engelbart&#x27;s studies of computer-display technology at SRI that led to the computer mouse. The public demonstration of a mouse-based user interface was later called &quot;the Mother of All Demos.&quot; At the Fall 1968 Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco, Engelbart, Bill English, Jeff Rulifson and the rest of the Human Augmentation Research Center team at SRI showed on a big screen how he could manipulate a computer remotely located in Menlo Park, while sitting on a San Francisco stage, using his mouse.

===ARPA===
In 1965, Taylor moved from NASA to IPTO, first as a deputy to Ivan Sutherland (who returned to academia shortly thereafter) to fund large programs in advanced research in computing at major universities and corporate research centers throughout the United States. Among the computer projects that ARPA supported was time-sharing, in which many users could work at terminals to share a single large computer. Users could work interactively instead of using punched cards or punched tape in a batch processing style. Taylor&#x27;s office in the Pentagon had a terminal connected to time-sharing at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a terminal connected to the Berkeley Timesharing System at the University of California, Berkeley, and a third terminal to the System Development Corporation in Santa Monica, California. He noticed each system developed a community of users, but was isolated from the other communities.

Taylor hoped to build a computer network to connect the ARPA-sponsored projects together, if nothing else, to let him communicate to all of them through one terminal. By June 1966, Taylor had been named director of IPTO; in this capacity, he shepherded the ARPANET project until 1969. Taylor had convinced ARPA director Charles M. Herzfeld to fund a network project earlier in February 1966, and Herzfeld transferred a million dollars from a ballistic missile defense program to Taylor&#x27;s budget. Taylor hired Larry Roberts from MIT Lincoln Laboratory to be its first program manager. Roberts first resisted moving to Washington DC, until Herzfeld reminded the director of Lincoln Laboratory that ARPA dominated its funding. Licklider continued to provide guidance, and Wesley A. Clark suggested the use of a dedicated computer, called the Interface Message Processor at each node of the network instead of centralized control. At the 1967 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, a member of Donald Davies&#x27; team (Roger Scantlebury) presented their research on packet switching and suggested it for use in the ARPANET. ARPA issued a request for quotation (RFQ) to build the system, which was awarded to Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN). ATT Bell Labs and IBM Research were invited to join, but were not interested. At a pivotal meeting in 1967 most participants resisted testing the new network; they thought it would slow down their research.

In 1968, Licklider and Taylor published &quot;The Computer as a Communication Device&quot;. The article laid out the future of what the Internet would eventually become. It began with a prophetic statement: &quot;In a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face.&quot;

Beginning in 1967, Taylor was sent by ARPA to investigate inconsistent reports coming from the Vietnam War. Only 35 years old, he was given an identification card with the military rank equivalent to his civilian position (brigadier general), thus ensuring protection under the Geneva convention if he were captured. Over the course of several trips to the area, he established a computer center at the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam base in Saigon. In his words: &quot;After that the White House got a single report rather than several. That pleased them; whether the data was any more correct or not, I don&#x27;t know, but at least it was more consistent.&quot; The Vietnam project took him away from directing research, and &quot;by 1969 I knew ARPANET would work. So I wanted to leave.&quot;

The election of Richard Nixon to the presidency and ongoing tensions with Roberts (who, despite maintaining a putatively cordial relationship with Taylor, resented his lack of research experience and appointment to the IPTO directorship) also factored in his decision to leave ARPA. For about a year, he joined Sutherland and David C. Evans at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, where he had funded a center for research on computer graphics while at ARPA.

Unable to acclimate to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints-dominated milieu, Taylor moved to Palo Alto, California in 1970 to become associate manager of the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL) at Xerox Corporation&#x27;s new Palo Alto Research Center.

===Xerox===
Although Taylor played an integral role in recruiting scientists for the laboratory from the ARPA network, physicist and Xerox PARC director George Pake felt that he was an unsuitable candidate to manage the group because he lacked a relevant doctorate and subsequent experience in academic research. While Taylor eschewed a Pake-proposed research program in computer graphics in favor of largely administering the day-to-day operations of the laboratory from its inception, he acquiesced to the appointment of BBN scientist and ARPA network acquaintance Jerome I. Elkind as titular CSL manager in 1971.

Technologies developed at PARC under Taylor&#x27;s aegis focused on reaching beyond ARPANET to develop what has become the Internet, and the systems that support today&#x27;s personal computers. They included:

*Powerful personal computers (including the Xerox Alto and later &quot;D-machines&quot;) with windowed displays and graphical user interfaces that inspired the Apple Lisa and Macintosh. The Computer Science Laboratory built the Alto, which was conceived by Butler Lampson and designed mostly by Charles P. Thacker, Edward M. McCreight, Bob Sproull and David Boggs. The Learning Research Group of PARC&#x27;s Systems Science Laboratory (led by Alan Kay) added the software-based &quot;desktop&quot; metaphor. 
*Ethernet, which networks local computers within a building or campus; and PARC Universal Packet (PUP) an early protocol for internetworking that connected the Ethernet to the ARPANET, which was a forerunner to TCP/IP and the Internet. PUP was primarily designed by Robert Metcalfe, David Boggs, Charles P. Thacker, Butler Lampson and John Shoch.
*The electronics and software that led to the laser printer (spearheaded by optical engineer Gary Starkweather, who transferred from Xerox&#x27;s Webster, New York laboratory to work with CSL) and the Interpress page description language that allowed John Warnock and Chuck Geschke to found Adobe Systems.
*&quot;What-you-see-is-what-you-get&quot; (WYSIWYG) word-processing programs, as exemplified by Bravo, which Charles Simonyi took to Microsoft to serve as the basis for Microsoft Word.
*SuperPaint, a pioneering graphics program and framebuffer computer system developed by Richard Shoup. The software was written in consultation with future Pixar co-founder Alvy Ray Smith, who could not secure an appointment at PARC and was retained as an independent contractor. Although Shoup received a special Emmy Award (shared with Xerox) in 1983 and an Academy Scientific Engineering Award (shared with Smith and Thomas Porter) in 1998 for his achievement, program development continued to be marginalized by Taylor and PARC, ultimately precipitating Shoup&#x27;s departure in 1979.

Belying his lack of programming and engineering experience, Taylor was noted for his strident advocacy of Licklider-inspired distributed personal computing and his ability to maintain collegial and productive relationships between what was widely perceived as the foremost array of the epoch&#x27;s leading computer scientists. This was exemplified by a weekly staff meeting at PARC (colloquially known as &quot;Dealer&quot; after Edward O. Thorp&#x27;s &quot;Beat the Dealer&quot;) in which staff members would lead a discussion about myriad topics. They would sit in a circle of beanbag chairs and open debate was encouraged. According to Kay, the meeting &quot;was part of the larger ARPA community to learn how to argue to illuminate rather than merely to win. ... The main purposes of Dealer -- as invented and implemented by Bob Taylor -- were to deal with how to make things work and make progress without having a formal manager structure. The presentations and argumentation were a small part of a deal session (they did quite bother visiting Xeroids). It was quite rare for anything like a personal attack to happen (because people for the most part came into PARC having been blessed by everyone there -- another Taylor rule -- and already knowing how &#x27;to argue reasonably&#x27;).&quot;

Throughout his tenure at PARC, Taylor frequently clashed with Elkind (who held budgetary responsibility for new projects but found his managerial authority undercut by Taylor&#x27;s intimate relationships with the research staff) and Pake (who did not countenance Taylor&#x27;s outsized influence in the laboratory and deprecatory attitude toward Xerox&#x27;s physics research program, then directly overseen by Pake); as a result, he was not officially invited to the company&#x27;s &quot;Futures Day&quot; demo (marking the public premiere of the Alto) in Boca Raton, Florida in 1977. However, after one of Elkind&#x27;s extended absences (stemming from his ongoing involvement in other corporate and government projects), Taylor became the manager of the laboratory in early 1978.

In 1983, physicist and integrated circuit specialist William J. Spencer became director of PARC. Spencer and Taylor disagreed about budget allocations for CSL (exemplified by the ongoing institutional divide between computer science and physics) and CSL&#x27;s frustration with Xerox&#x27;s inability to recognize and use what they had developed. In a heated discussion led by Elkind and above, it was implied that Taylor without his PhD might be let go he said he would do them one better, &quot;I quit&quot;, he said. After leaving the building, all of Taylor&#x27;s scientists were brought into a large meeting room and were informed of his departure from PARC. A scientist stood up and said that they had better get him back and that if they didn&#x27;t he would never set foot in this place again. Then, one by one, they all stood up and walked out. This sort of loyalty was unprecedented. By the end of the year, Taylor and most of the researchers at CSL who had left Xerox were rejoined again, this time in a Computer Corporation, not a copier company. A coterie of leading computer scientists (including Licklider, Donald Knuth and Dana Scott) expressed their displeasure with Xerox&#x27;s decision not to retain Taylor in a letter-writing campaign to CEO David Kearns.

===DEC SRC===
Taylor was hired by Ken Olsen of Digital Equipment Corporation, and formed the Systems Research Center in Palo Alto. Many of the former CSL researchers came to work at SRC. Among the projects at SRC were the Modula-3 programming language; the snoopy cache, used in the DEC Firefly multiprocessor workstation; the first multi-threaded Unix system; the first User Interface editor; the AltaVista search engine and a networked Window System.

==Retirement and death==
Taylor retired from DEC in 1996. Following his divorce (coinciding with his departure from Xerox), he lived in a secluded house in Woodside, California.

In 2000, he voiced two concerns about the future of the Internet: control and access. In his words:
There are many worse ways of endangering a larger number of people on the Internet than on the highway. It&#x27;s possible for people to generate networks that reproduce themselves and are very difficult or impossible to kill off. I want everyone to have the right to use it, but there&#x27;s got to be some way to insure responsibility.Will it be freely available to everyone? If not, it will be a big disappointment.

On April 13, 2017, he died at his home in Woodside, California. His son said he had suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other health problems.

==Awards==
In 1984, Taylor, Butler Lampson, and Charles P. Thacker received the ACM Software Systems Award &quot;for conceiving and guiding the development of the Xerox Alto System demonstrating that a distributed personal computer system can provide a desirable and practical alternative to time-sharing.&quot; In 1994, all three were named ACM Fellows in recognition of the same work. In 1999, Taylor received a National Medal of Technology and Innovation. The citation read &quot;For visionary leadership in the development of modern computing technology, including computer networks, the personal computer and the graphical user interface.&quot;

In 2004, the National Academy of Engineering awarded him along with Lampson, Thacker and Alan Kay their highest award, the Draper Prize. The citation reads: &quot;for the vision, conception, and development of the first practical networked personal computers.&quot;

In 2013, the Computer History Museum named him a Museum Fellow, &quot;for his leadership in the development of computer networking, online information and communications systems, and modern personal computing.&quot;

<text>A music box (American English) or musical box (British English) is an automatic musical instrument in a box that produces musical notes by using a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc to pluck the tuned teeth (or &quot;lamellae&quot;) of a steel comb. The popular device best known today as a &quot;music box&quot; developed from musical snuff boxes of the 18th century and were originally called (French for &quot;chimes of music&quot;). Some of the more complex boxes also contain a tiny drum and/or bells in addition to the metal comb.

==History==

The Symphonium company started business in 1885 as the first manufacturers of disc-playing music boxes. Two of the founders of the company, Gustave Brachhausen and Paul Riessner, left to set up a new firm, Polyphon, in direct competition with their original business and their third partner, Oscar Paul Lochmann. Following the establishment of the Original Musikwerke Paul Lochmann in 1900, the founding Symphonion business continued until 1909.

According to the Victoria Museums in Australia, &quot;The Symphonion is notable for the enormous diversity of types, styles, and models produced... No other disc-playing musical box exists in so many varieties. The company also pioneered the use of electric motors... the first model fitted with an electric motor being advertised in 1900. The company moved into the piano-orchestrion business and made both disc-operated and barrel-playing models, player-pianos, and phonographs.&quot;

Meanwhile, Polyphon expanded to America, where Brachhausen established the Regina Company. Regina was a spectacular success. It eventually reinvented itself as a maker of vacuums and steam cleaners.

In the heyday of the music box, some variations were as tall as a grandfather clock and all used interchangeable large disks to play different sets of tunes. These were spring-wound and driven and both had a bell-like sound. The machines were often made in England, Italy, and the US, with additional disks made in Switzerland, Austria, and Prussia. Early &quot;juke-box&quot; pay versions of them existed in public places. Marsh&#x27;s free Museum and curio shop in Long Beach, Washington (US) has several still-working versions of them on public display. The Musical Museum, Brentford, London has a number of machines. The Morris Museum in Morristown, New Jersey, USA has a notable collection, including interactive exhibits. In addition to video and audio footage of each piece, the actual instruments are demonstrated for the public daily on a rotational basis.

===Timeline===

9th century: In Baghdad, the Banū Mūsā brothers, a trio of Persian inventors, produced &quot;the earliest known mechanical musical instrument&quot;, in this case a hydropowered organ which played interchangeable cylinders automatically, which they described in their &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;. According to Charles B. Fowler, this &quot;cylinder with raised pins on the surface remained the basic device to produce and reproduce music mechanically until the second half of the nineteenth century.&quot;

Early 13th century: In Flanders, an ingenious bell ringer invents a cylinder with pins which operates cams, which then hit the bells.

1598: Flemish clockmaker Nicholas Vallin produces a wall-mounted clock which has a pinned barrel playing on multiple tuned bells mounted in the superstructure. The barrel can be programmed, as the pins can be separately placed in the holes provided on the surface of the barrel.

1665: Ahasuerus Fromanteel in London makes a table clock which has quarter striking and musical work on multiple bells operated by a pinned barrel. These barrels can be changed for those playing different tunes.

1772: A watch is made by one Ransonet at Nancy, France which has a pinned drum playing music not on bells but on tuned steel prongs arranged vertically.

1796: Antoine Favre-Salomon, a clockmaker from Geneva replaces the stack of bells by a comb with multiple pre-tuned metallic notes in order to reduce space. Together with a horizontally placed pinned barrel, this produces more varied and complex sounds. One of these first music boxes is now displayed at the Shanghai Gallery of Antique Music Boxes and Automata in Pudong&#x27;s Oriental Art Center.

1877: Thomas Edison invents the phonograph, which has important consequences for the musical-box industry, especially around the end of the century.


In 2010 American jazz guitarist Pat Metheny released the album Orchestrion on which he performed alongside a variety of custom-designed and built acoustic and electromechanical orchestrions which comprised the rest of the &quot;band&quot;, playing music in real-time through the MIDI file format.

==Repertoire==
In 1974–1975, German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen composed &quot;Tierkreis&quot;, a set of twelve pieces on the signs of the zodiac, for twelve music boxes.

<doc id="1002045" wikidata="Q7286" url="?curid=1002045" title="Émilie du Châtelet">
<text>Gabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise du Châtelet (; 17 December 1706 – 10 September 1749) was a French mathematician and natural philosopher (now called a physicist) from the early 1730s until her death in 1749.

Her most recognized achievement is her philosophical magnum opus, &quot;Institutions de Physique&quot; (Paris, 1740, first edition; &quot;Foundations of Physics&quot;). She then revised the text substantially for a second edition with the slightly modified title &quot;Institutions physiques&quot; (Paris, 1742). It circulated widely, generated heated debates, and was translated into German and Italian in 1743. The &quot;Institutions&quot; covers a wide range of topics, including the principles of knowledge, the existence of God, hypotheses, space, time, matter and the forces of nature. Several chapters treat Newton&#x27;s theory of universal gravity and associated phenomena. Later in life, she translated into French, and wrote an extensive commentary on, Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;. The text, published posthumously in 1756, is still considered the standard French translation to this day.

Du Châtelet participated in the famous &quot;vis viva&quot; debate, concerning the best way to measure the force of a body and the best means of thinking about conservation principles. Posthumously, her ideas were represented prominently in the most famous text of the French Enlightenment, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, first published shortly after du Châtelet&#x27;s death.

She is also known as the intellectual collaborator with and romantic partner of Voltaire. In the two centuries since her death, numerous biographies, books, and plays have been written about her life and work. In the early twenty-first century, her life and ideas have generated renewed interest.

== Contribution to philosophy ==
Du Châtelet wrote a number of significant scientific and philosophical works, including an essay on the nature of fire which was published by the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris, as well as her &quot;magnum opus&quot;, the &quot;Institutions de physique,&quot; which was also translated into German and Italian. In addition to her original works, Du Châtelet also produced influential translations of major works by authors such as Bernard Mandeville and Isaac Newton.

Because of her well-known collaboration and romantic involvement with Voltaire that spanned much of her adult life, her accomplishments have often been subsumed under his, and historical accounts have often mentioned her only within the context of Voltaire&#x27;s life and work during the period of the early French Enlightenment. However, the nature of their relationship was collaborative. Voltaire acknowledged that du Châtelet&#x27;s mathematical expertise was a crucial aid in understanding the technical parts of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; while writing his popularization of the Newtonian philosophy, &quot;Éléments de la philosophie de Newton&quot;.

Recently, scholars have taken a renewed interest in du Châtelet, which has resulted in a renewed appreciation of her original contributions. Historical evidence indicates that her work had a very significant influence on the philosophical and scientific conversations of the 1730s and 1740s – in fact, she was famous and respected by the greatest thinkers of her time. Francesco Algarotti styled the dialogue of &quot;Il Newtonianismo per le dame&quot; based on conversations he observed between du Châtelet and Voltaire at Cirey.

Du Châtelet corresponded with the renowned mathematicians Johann II Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler, early developers of calculus. She was also tutored by Bernoulli&#x27;s prodigy students, Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis and Alexis Claude Clairaut. Frederick the Great of Prussia, who re-founded the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, was her great admirer, and corresponded with both Voltaire and du Châtelet regularly. He introduced du Châtelet to Leibniz&#x27;s philosophy by sending her the works of Christian Wolff, and du Châtelet sent him a copy of her &quot;Institutions&quot;.

Her works were published and republished in Paris, London, and Amsterdam; they were translated into German and Italian; and, they were discussed in the most important scholarly journals of the era, including the &quot;Memoires des Trévoux&quot;, the &quot;Journal des Sçavans&quot;, the &quot;Göttingische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen&quot;, and others.

Many of her ideas were represented in various sections of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert, and some of the articles in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; are a direct copy of her work.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Émilie du Châtelet was born on 17 December 1706 in Paris, the only daughter amongst six children. Three brothers lived to adulthood: René-Alexandre Le Tonnelier de Breteuil (1698–1720), Charles-Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil (1701–1731) and abbot (1710–1781). Her eldest brother, René-Alexandre, died in 1720, and the next brother, Charles-Auguste, died in 1731. However, her younger brother, Elisabeth-Théodore, lived to a successful old age, becoming an abbot and eventually a bishop. Two other brothers died very young. Du Châtelet also had a half-sister, Michelle, born in 1686, of her father and Anne Bellinzani, an intelligent woman who was interested in astronomy and married to an important Parisian official.

Her father was Louis Nicolas le Tonnelier de Breteuil (1648–1728), a member of the lesser nobility. At the time of du Châtelet&#x27;s birth, her father held the position of the Principal Secretary and Introducer of Ambassadors to King Louis XIV. He held a weekly &quot;salon&quot; on Thursdays, to which well-respected writers and scientists were invited. Her mother was Gabrielle Anne de Froulay (1670–1740), Baronne de Breteuil and daughter of soldier (1601–1671). Her paternal grandfather was administrator (1609–1685). Her paternal uncle was cleric Claude Le Tonnelier de Breteuil (1644–1698). Among her cousins was nobleman François Victor Le Tonnelier de Breteuil (1686–1743), son of her uncle François Le Tonnelier de Breteuil (1638–1705). Among her nephews was aristocrat, diplomat and statesman Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil (1730–1807).

=== Early education ===
Du Châtelet&#x27;s education has been the subject of much speculation, and nothing is known with certainty.

Among their acquaintances was Fontenelle, the perpetual secretary of the French Académie des Sciences. Du Châtelet&#x27;s father Louis-Nicolas, recognizing her early brilliance, arranged for Fontenelle to visit and talk about astronomy with her when she was 10 years old. Her mother, Gabrielle-Anne de Froulay, had been brought up in a convent, which was at that time the predominant educational institution available to French girls and women. While some sources believe her mother did not approve of her intelligent daughter, or of her husband&#x27;s encouragement of Émilie&#x27;s intellectual curiosity, there are also other indications that her mother not only approved of du Châtelet&#x27;s early education, but actually encouraged her to vigorously question stated fact.

In either case, such encouragement would have been seen as unusual for parents of their time and status. When she was small, her father arranged training for her in physical activities such as fencing and riding, and as she grew older, he brought tutors to the house for her. As a result, by the age of twelve she was fluent in Latin, Italian, Greek and German; she was later to publish translations into French of Greek and Latin plays and philosophy. She received education in mathematics, literature, and science.

Du Châtelet also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the harpsichord, sang opera, and was an amateur actress. As a teenager, short of money for books, she used her mathematical skills to devise highly successful strategies for gambling.

=== Marriage ===
On 12 June 1725, she married the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont (1695–1765). Her marriage conferred the title of Marquise du Chastellet. Like many marriages among the nobility, theirs was arranged. As a wedding gift, her husband was made governor of Semur-en-Auxois in Burgundy by his father; the recently married couple moved there at the end of September 1725. Du Châtelet was eighteen at the time, her husband thirty-four.

Émilie du Châtelet and the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont had three children: Françoise-Gabrielle-Pauline (1726–1754), married in 1743 to Alfonso Carafa, Duca di Montenero (1713–1760), Louis Marie Florent (1727–1793), and Victor-Esprit (1733–1734). Victor-Esprit died as an infant in late summer 1734, likely the last Sunday in August. On 4 September 1749 Émilie du Châtelet gave birth to Stanislas-Adélaïde du Châtelet, daughter of Jean François de Saint-Lambert. She died as a toddler in Lunéville on 6 May 1751.

=== Resumption of studies ===
After bearing three children, Émilie, Marquise du Châtelet, considered her marital responsibilities fulfilled and reached an agreement with her husband to live separate lives while still maintaining one household. In 1733, aged 26, du Châtelet resumed her mathematical studies. Initially, she was tutored in algebra and calculus by Moreau de Maupertuis, a member of the Academy of Sciences; although mathematics was not his forte, he had received a solid education from Johann Bernoulli, who also taught Leonhard Euler. However by 1735 du Châtelet had turned for her mathematical training to Alexis Clairaut, a mathematical prodigy known best for Clairaut&#x27;s equation and Clairaut&#x27;s theorem. Du Châtelet resourcefully sought some of France&#x27;s best tutors and scholars to mentor her in mathematics. On one occasion at the Café Gradot, a place where men frequently gathered for intellectual discussion, she was politely ejected when she attempted to join one of her teachers. Undeterred, she returned and entered after having men&#x27;s clothing made for her.

=== Relationship with Voltaire ===
Du Châtelet may have met Voltaire in her childhood at one of her father&#x27;s &quot;salons&quot;; Voltaire himself dates their meeting to 1729, when he returned from his exile in London. However, their friendship developed from May 1733 when she re-entered society after the birth of her third child.

Du Châtelet invited Voltaire to live at her country house at Cirey in Haute-Marne, northeastern France, and he became her long-time companion. There she studied physics and mathematics, and published scientific articles and translations. To judge from Voltaire&#x27;s letters to friends and their commentaries on each other&#x27;s work, they lived together with great mutual liking and respect. As a literary rather than scientific person, Voltaire implicitly acknowledged her contributions to his 1738 &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Newton&quot;. This was through a poem dedicated to her at the beginning of the text and in the preface, where Voltaire praised her study and contributions. The book&#x27;s chapters on optics show strong similarities with her own &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;optique&quot;. She was able to contribute further to the campaign by a laudatory review in the &quot;Journal des savants&quot;.

Sharing a passion for science, Voltaire and du Châtelet collaborated scientifically. They set up a laboratory in du Châtelet&#x27;s home in Lorraine. In a healthy competition, they both entered the 1738 Paris Academy prize contest on the nature of fire, since du Châtelet disagreed with Voltaire&#x27;s essay. Although neither of them won, both essays received honourable mention and were published. She thus became the first woman to have a scientific paper published by the Academy.

==== Social life after living with Voltaire ====

Du Châtelet&#x27;s relationship with Voltaire caused her to give up most of her social life to become more involved with her study in mathematics with the teacher of Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis. He introduced the ideas of Isaac Newton to her. Letters written by du Châtelet explain how she felt during the transition from Parisian socialite to rural scholar, from &quot;one life to the next&quot;.

=== Later pregnancy and death ===

In May 1748, du Châtelet began an affair with the poet Jean François de Saint-Lambert and became pregnant. In a letter to a friend, she confided her fears that she would not survive her pregnancy. On the night of 4 September 1749 she gave birth to a daughter, Stanislas-Adélaïde. Du Châtelet died on 10 September 1749 at Château de Lunéville, from a pulmonary embolism. She was 42. Her infant daughter died 20 months later.

== Scientific research and publications ==

=== Criticizing Locke and the debate on &quot;thinking matter&quot; ===
In her writings, du Châtelet criticized John Locke&#x27;s philosophy. She emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience: &quot;Locke&#x27;s idea of the possibility of &quot;thinking matter&quot; is […] abstruse&quot;. Her critique on Locke originated in her commentary on Bernard de Mandeville&#x27;s &quot;The Fable of the Bees&quot;. She resolutely favored universal principles that precondition human knowledge and action, and maintained that this kind of law is innate. Du Châtelet claimed the necessity of a universal presupposition, because if there were no such beginning, all our knowledge is relative. In that way, Du Châtelet rejected Locke&#x27;s aversion to innate ideas and prior principles. She also reversed Locke&#x27;s negation of the principle of contradiction, which would constitute the basis of her methodic reflections in the &quot;Institutions&quot;. On the contrary, she affirmed her arguments in favor of the necessity of prior and universal principles. &quot;Two and two could then make as well 4 as 6 if prior principles did not exist.&quot;

References by Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis and Julien Offray de La Mettrie to du Châtelet&#x27;s deliberations on motion, free will, &quot;thinking matter&quot;, numbers, and the way to conduct metaphysics are a sign of the importance of her reflections. She rebuts the claim to finding truth by using mathematical laws, and argues against Maupertuis.

=== Fire, heat, and combustion ===

In 1737, the Royal Academy of Science in Paris (now French Academy of Sciences) announced an essay competition on the question of the nature and propagation of fire, to be awarded the following year. Voltaire, who was then working with Du Châtelet at her estate in Cirey, entered the competition. Eventually, Du Châtelet decided to enter herself, though without informing Voltaire, with whom she had significant theoretical disagreements. While neither of them won the competition, their essays were judged to be of sufficient quality to be published in the collections of the Academy, alongside the winning essays. Her &quot;Dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu&quot; thus appeared in 1739, the first time the Academy published a work written by a woman. Du Châtelet&#x27;s essay takes the position that fire is a distinctive type of matter, a common view in the period, and sought to use mechanical theory to understand its properties. For instance, she argued that it is a massless particle, whereas Voltaire had claimed fire had weight. She also speculated that there may be colors in other suns that are not found in the spectrum of sunlight on Earth.

===&quot;Institutions de Physique&quot;===
Her book &quot;Institutions de Physique&quot; (&quot;Lessons in Physics&quot;) was published in 1740; it was presented as a review of new ideas in science and philosophy to be studied by her 13-year-old son, but it incorporated and sought to reconcile complex ideas from the leading thinkers of the time. The book and subsequent debate contributed to her becoming a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in 1746. Du Châtelet originally preferred anonymity in her role as the author, because she wished to conceal her gender. Ultimately, however, &quot;Institutions&quot; was convincing to salon-dwelling intellectuals in spite of the commonplace sexism.

&quot;Institutions&quot; discussed, refuted, and synthesized many ideas of prominent mathematicians and physicists of the time. In particular, the text is famous for discussing ideas that originated with G. W. Leibniz and Christian Wolff, and for using the principle of sufficient reason often associated with their philosophical work. This main work is equally famous for providing a detailed discussion and evaluation of ideas that originated with Isaac Newton and his followers. That combination is more remarkable than it might seem now, since the ideas of Leibniz and Newton were regarded as fundamentally opposed to one another by most of the major philosophical figures of the eighteenth century.

In chapter I, du Châtelet included a description of her rules of reasoning, based largely on Descartes’s principle of contradiction and Leibniz’s principle of sufficient reason. In chapter II, she applied these rules of reasoning to metaphysics, discussing God, space, time, and matter. In chapters III through VI, du Châtelet continued to discuss the role of God and his relationship to his creation. In chapter VII, she broke down the concept of matter into three parts: the macroscopic substance available to sensory perception, the atoms composing that macroscopic material, and an even smaller constituent unit similarly imperceptible to human senses. However, she carefully added that there was no way to know how many levels truly existed.

The remainder of &quot;Institutions&quot; considered more metaphysics and classical mechanics. Du Châtelet discussed the concepts of space and time in a manner more consistent with modern relativity than her contemporaries. She described both space and time in the abstract, as representations of the relationships between coexistent bodies rather than physical substances. This included an acknowledgement that &quot;absolute&quot; place is an idealization and that &quot;relative&quot; place is the only real, measurable quantity. Du Châtelet also presented a thorough explanation of Newton’s laws of motion and their function on earth.

=== Forces Vives ===

In 1741, du Châtelet published a book entitled &quot;Réponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet, a la lettre que M. de Mairan&quot;. D&#x27;Ortous de Mairan, secretary of the Academy of Sciences, had published a set of arguments addressed to her regarding the appropriate mathematical expression for &quot;forces vives&quot; (&quot;living forces&quot;). Du Châtelet presented a point-by-point rebuttal of de Mairan&#x27;s arguments, causing him to withdraw from the controversy.

Immanuel Kant&#x27;s first publication in 1747, &#x27;Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces&#x27; (&quot;Gedanken zur wahren Schätzung der lebendigen Kräfte&quot;), focused on du Châtelet&#x27;s pamphlet rebutting the arguments of the secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, Mairan. Kant&#x27;s opponent, Johann Augustus Eberhard, accused Kant of taking ideas from du Châtelet. In his &quot;Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime&quot;, Kant wrote ad hominem and sexist critiques of learned women of the time, including Mme Du Châtelet, rather than writing about their work. Kant stated: &quot;A woman who has a head full of Greek, like Mme. Dacier, or who conducts disputations about mechanics, like the Marquise du Châtelet might as well also wear a beard; for that might perhaps better express the mien of depth for which they strive.&quot;

=== Advocacy of kinetic energy ===
Although in the early eighteenth century the concepts of force and momentum had been long understood, the idea of energy as being transferable between different systems was still in its infancy, and would not be fully resolved until the nineteenth century. It is now accepted that the total mechanical momentum of a system is conserved and that none is lost to friction. Simply put, there is no &#x27;momentum friction&#x27;, and momentum cannot transfer between different forms, and particularly, there is no &#x27;potential momentum&#x27;. In the twentieth century, Emmy Noether proved this to be true for all problems where the initial state is symmetric in generalized coordinates. E.g., mechanical energy, either kinetic or potential, may be lost to another form, but the total is conserved in time.

Du Châtelet&#x27;s contribution was the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. In doing so, she became the first to elucidate the concept of energy as such, and to quantify its relationship to mass and velocity based on her own empirical studies. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by Willem &#x27;s Gravesande in which heavy balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball&#x27;s kinetic energy – as indicated by the quantity of material displaced – was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity: She showed that if two balls were identical except for their mass, they would make the same size indentation in the clay if the quantity formula_1 (then called &quot;vis viva&quot;) were the same for each ball.

Newton&#x27;s work assumed the exact conservation of only mechanical momentum. A broad range of mechanical problems in physics are soluble only if energy conservation is included. The collision and scattering of two point masses is one example. Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange established a more formal framework for mechanics using the results of du Châtelet.

===Translation and commentary on Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;===
In 1749, the year of du Châtelet&#x27;s death, she completed the work regarded as her outstanding achievement: her translation into French, with her commentary, of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (often referred to as simply the &quot;Principia&quot;), including her derivation of the notion of conservation of energy from its principles of mechanics. Despite modern misconceptions, Newton&#x27;s work on his &quot;Principia&quot; was not perfect. Du Châtelet took on the task of not only translating his work from Latin to French, but adding important information to it as well. Her commentary was as essential to her contemporaries as her spreading of Newton&#x27;s ideas. Du Châtelet&#x27;s commentary was very extensive, comprising almost two-thirds of volume II of her edition.

To undertake a formidable project such as this, du Châtelet prepared to translate the &quot;Principia&quot; by continuing her studies in analytic geometry, mastering calculus, and reading important works in experimental physics. It was her rigorous preparation that allowed her to add a lot more accurate information to her commentary, both from herself and other scientists she studied or worked with. She was one of only 20 or so people in the 1700s who could understand such advanced math and apply the knowledge to other works. This helped du Châtelet greatly, not only with her work on the &quot;Principia&quot; but also in her other important works like the &quot;Institutions de Physique&quot;.

Du Châtelet made very important corrections in her translation that helped support Newton&#x27;s theories about the universe. Newton, based on the theory of fluids, suggested that gravitational attraction would cause the poles of the earth to flatten, thus causing the earth to bulge outwards at the equator. In Clairaut&#x27;s &quot;Memoire&quot;, which confirmed Newton&#x27;s hypothesis about the shape of the earth and gave more accurate approximations, Clairaut discovered a way to determine the shape of the other planets in the solar system. Du Châtelet used Clairaut&#x27;s proposal that the planets had different densities in her commentary to correct Newton&#x27;s belief that the earth and the other planets were made of homogeneous substances.

Du Châtelet used the work of Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician and physicist, to further explain Newton&#x27;s theory of the tides. This proof depended upon the three-body problem which still confounded even the best mathematicians in 18th century Europe. Using Clairaut&#x27;s hypothesis about the differing of the planets&#x27; densities, Bernoulli theorized that the moon was 70 times denser than Newton had believed. Du Châtelet used this discovery in her commentary of the &quot;Principia&quot;, further supporting Newton&#x27;s theory about the law of gravitation.

Published ten years after her death, today du Châtelet&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Principia&quot; is still the standard translation of the work into French, and remains the only complete rendition in that language. Her translation was so important that it was the only one in any language used by Newtonian expert I. Bernard Cohen to write his own English version of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;. Du Châtelet not only used the works of other great scientists to revise Newton&#x27;s work, but she added her own thoughts and ideas as a scientist in her own right. Her contributions in the French translation made Newton and his ideas look even better in the scientific community and around the world, and recognition for this is owed to du Châtelet. This enormous project, along with her &quot;Foundations of Physics&quot;, proved du Châtelet&#x27;s abilities as a great mathematician. Her translation and commentary of the &quot;Principia&quot; contributed to the completion of the scientific revolution in France and to its acceptance in Europe.

===Possible Influence on Immanuel Kant===

Kant mostly engaged with Georg Friedrich Meier’s Excerpts from the Doctrine of Reason (1752) in his logic lectures. It is highly plausible that Du Châtelet’s presence was recognized by contemporaries such as Baumgarten, which alludes to a connection that might have broader implications for Kant’s knowledge of Du Châtelet. Notably, Meier’s involvement in the publication of Christine Ziegler (later Unzer)’s work Grundriss einer Weltweisheit für das Frauenzimmer (A Sketch of a World Wisdom for Women) suggests a potential linkage to Du Châtelet’s philosophical ideas. Hence, Du Châtelet’s name held certain significance within Meier’s sphere of influence. The immediate translation of the Institutions into German following its release also implies its likely role in paving the philosophical path for Kant’s later endeavors.

== Illusions and happiness ==
In &quot;Discours sur le bonheur&quot;, Émilie Du Châtelet argues that illusions are an instrument for happiness. To be happy, “one must have freed oneself of prejudice, one must be virtuous, healthy, have tastes and passions, and be susceptible to illusions...”. She mentions many things one needs for happiness, but emphasizes the necessity of illusions and that one should not dismiss all illusions. One should not abandon all illusions because they can bestow positivity and hope, which can ameliorate one&#x27;s well-being. But Du Châtelet also warns against trusting all illusions, because many illusions are harmful to oneself. They may cause negativity through a false reality, which can cause disappointment or even limit one’s abilities. This lack of self-awareness from so many illusions may cause one to be self-deceived. She suggests a balance of trusting and rejecting illusions for happiness, so as not to become self-deceived.

In &quot;Foundation of Physics&quot;, Émilie Du Châtelet discusses avoiding error by applying two principles – the principle of contradiction and the principle of sufficient reason. Du Châtelet presumed that all knowledge is developed from more fundamental knowledge that relies on infallible knowledge. She states that this infallible fundamental knowledge is most reliable because it is self-explanatory and exists with a small number of conclusions. Her logic and principles are used for an arguably less flawed understanding of physics, metaphysics, and morals.

The principle of contradiction essentially claims that the thing implying a contradiction is impossible. So, if one does not use the principle of contradiction, one will have errors including the failure to reject a contradiction-causing element. To get from the possible or impossible to the actual or real, the principle of sufficient reason was revised by Du Châtelet from Leibniz&#x27;s concept and integrated into science. The principle of sufficient reason suggests that every true thing has a reason for being so, and things without a reason do not exist. In essence, every effect has a cause, so the element in question must have a reasonable cause to be so.

In application, Émilie Du Châtelet proposed that being happy and immoral are mutually exclusive. According to Du Châtelet, this principle is embedded within the hearts of all individuals, and even wicked individuals have an undeniable consciousness of this contradiction that is grueling. It suggests one cannot be living a happy life while living immorally. So, her suggested happiness requires illusions with a virtuous life. These illusions are naturally given like passions and tastes, and cannot be created. Du Châtelet recommended we maintain the illusions we receive and work to not dismantle the trustworthy illusions, because we cannot get them back. In other words, true happiness is a blending of illusions and morality. If one merely attempts to be moral, one will not obtain the happiness one deeply seeks. If one just strives for the illusions, one will not get the happiness that is genuinely desired. One needs to endeavor in both illusions and happiness to get the sincerest happiness.

==Other contributions==

===Development of financial derivatives===
Du Châtelet lost the considerable sum for the time of 84,000 francs—some of it borrowed—in one evening at the table at the Court of Fontainebleau, to card cheats. To raise the money to pay back her debts, she devised an ingenious financing arrangement similar to modern derivatives, whereby she paid tax collectors a fairly low sum for the right to their future earnings (they were allowed to keep a portion of the taxes they collected for the King), and promised to pay the court gamblers part of these future earnings.

===Biblical scholarship===
Du Châtelet wrote a critical analysis of the entire Bible. A synthesis of her remarks on the Book of Genesis was published in English in 1967 by Ira O. Wade of Princeton in his book &quot;Voltaire and Madame du Châtelet: An Essay on Intellectual Activity at Cirey&quot; and a book of her complete notes was published in 2011, in the original French, edited and annotated by Bertram Eugene Schwarzbach.

===Translation of the &quot;Fable of the Bees&quot;, and other works===
Du Châtelet translated &quot;The Fable of the Bees&quot; in a free adaptation. She also wrote works on optics, rational linguistics, and the nature of free will.

===Support of women&#x27;s education===
In her first independent work, the preface to her translation of the &quot;Fable of the Bees&quot;, du Châtelet argued strongly for women&#x27;s education, particularly a strong secondary education as was available for young men in the French &quot;collèges&quot;. By denying women a good education, she argued, society prevents women from becoming eminent in the arts and sciences.

==Legacy==

Du Châtelet made a crucial scientific contribution in making Newton&#x27;s historic work more accessible in a timely, accurate and insightful French translation, augmented by her own original concept of energy conservation.

A main-belt minor planet and a crater on Venus have been named in her honor, and she is the subject of three plays: &quot;Legacy of Light&quot; by Karen Zacarías; &quot;Émilie: La Marquise Du Châtelet Defends Her Life Tonight&quot; by Lauren Gunderson and &quot;Urania: the Life of Émilie du Châtelet&quot; by Jyl Bonaguro. The opera &quot;Émilie&quot; by Kaija Saariaho is about the last moments of her life.

Du Châtelet is often represented in portraits with mathematical iconography, such as holding a pair of dividers or a page of geometrical calculations. In the early nineteenth century, a French pamphlet of celebrated women (&quot;Femmes célèbres&quot;) introduced a possibly apocryphal story of her childhood. According to this story, a servant fashioned a doll for her by dressing up wooden dividers as a doll; however, du Châtelet undressed the dividers, and intuiting their original purpose, drew a circle with them.

The Institut Émilie du Châtelet, which was founded in France in 2006, supports &quot;the development and diffusion of research on women, sex, and gender&quot;.

Since 2016, the French Society of Physics (la Société Française de Physique) has awarded the Émilie Du Châtelet Prize to a physicist or team of researchers for excellence in Physics.

Duke University also presents an annual Du Châtelet Prize in Philosophy of Physics &quot;for previously unpublished work in philosophy of physics by a graduate student or junior scholar&quot;.

On December 17, 2021, Google Doodle honored du Châtelet.

Émilie du Châtelet was portrayed by the actress Hélène de Fougerolles in the docudrama &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Big Idea&quot;.

<doc id="1002046" wikidata="Q1750069" url="?curid=1002046" title="Caieiras">
<text>Caieiras is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. The population is 102,775 (2020 est.) in an area of 97.64 km2. Due to the municipality&#x27;s large reforestation area, it is known as the &quot;City of the Pines&quot;.

The municipality contains part of the Cantareira State Park, created in 1962, which protects a large part of the metropolitan São Paulo water supply.

The municipality is served by CPTM Line 7 (Ruby).

==Economy==
The economy of the city is based on paper industry. Most of the territory of the town consists of reforesting areas belonging to Companhia Melhoramentos de São Paulo.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>The Seal of Solomon or Ring of Solomon (, &#x27;; ,&#x27;) is the legendary signet ring attributed to king Solomon in medieval mystical traditions, from which it developed in parallel within Jewish mysticism, Islamic mysticism and Western occultism.

It is often depicted in the shape of either a pentagram or a hexagram. In mystic Islamic and Jewish lore, the ring is variously described as having given Solomon the power to command the supernatural, including &#x27; and&#x27;, and also the ability to speak with animals. Due to the proverbial wisdom of Solomon, it came to be seen as an amulet or talisman, or a symbol or character in medieval magic and Renaissance magic, occultism, and alchemy.

The seal is the predecessor to the Star of David, a Jewish symbol, and in modern vexillology, it features on the Flag of Israel. The pentagram on the Flag of Morocco also represents the seal. The Seal of Solomon was also depicted on the flag of Nigeria during British colonial rule.

==History==

The earliest references to Solomon&#x27;s seal or signet stem from within Jewish traditions. It is first mentioned by the first-century Jewish historian Josephus, and is similarly referenced by the third-century Jewish magical text Sefer HaRazim, and an aggadic section of the Tractate Gittin within the Babylonian Talmud as well. In parallel, a first century Greek manual of Judeo-Christian magic known as &quot;Testament of Solomon&quot; also makes reference to the Seal of Solomon.

Jewish scholars claim that the tradition of Solomon&#x27;s Seal later made its way into Islamic Arab sources, as Gershom Scholem (the founder of the modern, academic study of Kabbalah) attests &quot;It is difficult to say for how long certain definite names have been used for several of the most common seals. The Arabs made many such terms especially popular, but just the names Seal of Solomon and Shield of David, which are often used interchangeably for the two emblems, go back to pre-Islamic Jewish magic. it did not originate among the Arabs who, incidentally, know only the designation Seal of Solomon.&quot; However, other scholars have demonstrated a wide variety of other origins for its use, including late Babylonian, cuneiform from ancient Mesopotamia, Egyptian hieroglyphs, early Ancient South Arabian script, Tifinagh, Ancient Greek alphabet, Indian Hinduism and Byzantine Greeks.
The widespread use of the symbol within Arab culture, and within many cultures in contact with Arabs, makes such claims spurious. 

The legend of the Seal of Solomon was developed further by medieval Middle Eastern writers, who related that the ring was engraved by God and was given to the king directly from heaven. The ring was made from brass and iron, and the two parts were used to seal written commands to good and evil spirits, respectively. In one tale, a demon — either &quot;Asmodeus&quot; or &quot;Sakhr&quot; — obtained possession of the ring and ruled in Solomon&#x27;s stead for forty days. In a variant of the tale of the ring of Polycrates from Herodotus, the demon eventually threw the ring into the sea, where it was swallowed by a fish, caught by a charitable fisherman, who unknowingly fed it to the displaced Solomon, restoring him to power.

The date of origin legends surrounding the Seal of Solomon is difficult to establish. A legend of a magic ring with which the possessor could command demons was already current in the 1st century (Josephus telling of one Eleazar who used such a ring in the presence of Vespasian), but the association of the name of Solomon with such a ring is likely medieval notwithstanding the 2nd century apocryphal text the Testament of Solomon. The Tractate Gittin (fol. 68) of the Talmud has a story involving Solomon, Asmodeus, and a ring with the divine name engraved: Solomon gives the ring and a chain to one Benaiahu son of Jehoiada to catch the demon Ashmedai, to obtain the demon&#x27;s help to build the temple; Ashmedai later tricks Solomon into giving him the ring and swallows it.

The specification of the design of the seal as a hexagram seems to arise from a medieval Arab tradition, and most scholars assume that the symbol entered the Kabbalistic tradition of medieval Spain from Arabic literature. The representation as a pentagram, by contrast, seems to arise in the Western tradition of Renaissance magic (which was in turn strongly influenced by medieval Arab and Jewish occultism); W. Kennett (1660–1728) makes reference to a &quot;pentangle of Solomon&quot; with the power of exorcising demons.

Hexagrams feature prominently in Jewish esoteric literature from the early medieval period, and it has been hypothesized that the tradition of Solomon&#x27;s Seal may possibly predate Islam and date to early Rabbinical esoteric tradition, or to early alchemy in Hellenistic Judaism in 3rd century Egypt.

The seal appears profusely in the decoration of the 17th-century Catholic Sacromonte Abbey, in Granada, Spain, as a symbol of wisdom. The Seal of Solomon was also discovered in Palestine during the Ottoman period, when it was etched in stone above windows and doors and on Muslim tombs. A few examples were found in houses in Saris and on graves in Jaffa.

An &quot;Order of Solomon&#x27;s Seal&quot; was established in 1874 in Ethiopia, where the ruling house claimed descent from Solomon.

==Other traditions==
In Islamic eschatology, some believe that the Beast of the Earth, which should appear near the Last Judgment day, will come bearing &quot;the Seal of Solomon&quot;, and will use the latter to stamp the noses of the unbelievers.

==Use in vexillology==

In 1354, King of Bohemia Charles IV prescribed for the Jews of Prague a red flag with both David&#x27;s shield and Solomon&#x27;s seal, while the red flag with which the Jews met King Matthias of Hungary in the 15th century showed two pentagrams with two golden stars.

The pentagram on the current flag of Morocco is meant to represent the Seal, as well as the five pillars of Islam.

The hexagram or Star of David, which became a symbol of Judaism in the modern period and was placed on the flag of Israel in 1948, has its origins in 14th-century depictions of the Seal of Solomon.

The flag of Hayreddin Barbarossa had a Seal of Solomon between the blades of a zulfiqar.

==In popular culture==
Lippmann Moses Büschenthal (d. 1818) wrote a tragedy with the title &quot;Der Siegelring Salomonis&quot; (&quot;the signet-ring of Solomon&quot;).

<text>Martin Ruland the Elder (1532, in Freising – 3 February 1602), also known as &quot;Martinus Rulandus&quot; or &quot;Martin Rulandt&quot;, was a German physician, alchemist and classical philologist. He was a follower of the physician Paracelsus.

Ruland was born as the son of the pharmacist Balthasar Ruland (1489-1534). After completing his studies, he initially worked as a balneologist in Giengen. From around 1565, Ruland taught pharmacology, physics and Greek at the &quot;Gymnasium illustre&quot; (now Albertus-Gymnasium) in Lauingen as &quot;professor publicus&quot;. He also practised in Lauingen as the city physician and personal physician to Count palatine Philipp Ludwig.

In his function as personal physician to Emperor Rudolf II, Ruland later moved to Prague where he stayed until his death in 1602. Fragments of his tombstone were used in the construction of Lauingen&#x27;s fortified tower at Oberanger, which are still visible today.

Ruland had six known descendants. Four of his sons also became doctors. His son Martin Ruland the Younger (1569–1611) also became a renowned physician and alchemist.

Presumably the elder of the two published &quot;Centuries&quot; of cures titled &quot;Curationum empiricarum et historicarum Centuria&quot; in 10 volumes from 1578 to 1596 in Basel.

== Works ==
Ruland&#x27;s writings are rooted in the alchemical views of his time. He mostly used antimony-containing emetics as remedies. His antimony potassium tartrate-based emetic &quot;(aqua benedicta rulandi&quot; or Ruland&#x27;s water) became well known and was found in pharmacopoeias until the 19th century.

Ruland is considered to be the first person to describe the clinical symptoms of Rolandic epilepsy (1597), which was not named after him but after the Italian anatomist Luigi Rolando, despite the similarity in name.

In addition to his medical activities, Ruland wrote medical texts on bloodletting and cupping as well as balneological applications of water for diseases. He als published writings on the Greek language, such as the frequently published &quot;Dictionarium latino-graecum sive synonymorum copia&quot;.

A lexicon of alchemy written by his son Ruland the Younger was often attributed to Ruland the Elder.

<doc id="1002066" wikidata="Q1444581" url="?curid=1002066" title="Superflat">
<text>Superflat is a postmodern art movement, founded by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami, which is influenced by manga and anime. However, superflat does not have an explicit definition because Takashi Murakami does not want to limit the movement, but rather leave room for it to grow and evolve over time.

Superflat is also the name of a 2000 art exhibition, curated by Murakami, that toured West Hollywood, Minneapolis and Seattle.

==Description==
&quot;Superflat&quot; is used by Murakami to refer to various flattened forms in Japanese graphic art, animation, pop culture and fine arts, as well as the &quot;shallow emptiness of Japanese consumer culture.&quot; Superflat has been embraced by American artists, who have created a hybrid called &quot;SoFlo Superflat&quot;.

Murakami defines &quot;Superflat&quot; in broad terms, so the subject matter is very diverse. Some works explore the consumerism and sexual fetishism that is prevalent in post-war Japanese culture. This often includes lolicon art, which is parodied by works such as those by Henmaru Machino. These works are an exploration of otaku sexuality through grotesque and/or distorted images. Other works are more concerned with a fear of growing up. For example, Yoshitomo Nara&#x27;s work often features playful graffiti on old Japanese &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; executed in a childish manner. And some works focus on the structure and underlying desires that comprise otaku and overall post-war Japanese culture. Murakami is influenced by directors such as Hideaki Anno.

Superflat is not limited to contemporary art alone. Murakami cites older Japanese pieces as superflat as well, including Katsushika Hokusai&#x27;s &quot;Thunderstorm Beneath the Summit&quot; (1830–32) as an example of superflat.

A subversive look at otakuism is not a defining factor of Kaikai Kiki&#x27;s galleries; Bome, one of the most important artists involved with the first Superflat exhibition, is a famous otaku figure sculptor and his work based on existing bishōjo anime characters has been showcased in multiple galleries including a solo exhibition in the Kaikai Kiki Gallery. The artist Mr. is a self-described lolicon and views his artwork to be not a cultural commentary but a portrayal of his own personal fantasies.

==Artists==
Superflat artists include Chiho Aoshima, Keiichi Tanaami, Ayako Rokkaku, Mahomi Kunikata, Sayuri Michima, Yoshitomo Nara, Yuko Yamaguchi, Aya Takano, Yusuke Nakamura, Tomokazu Matsuyama, Sebastian Masuda, Fantasista Utamaro and Takashi Murakami. In addition, some animators within anime and some manga artists have had their past and present work exhibited in Superflat exhibitions, especially Kōji Morimoto, Keita Takahashi, Seizō Watase, Seiichi Hayashi, Hibiki Yoshizaki, and the work of Hitoshi Tomizawa, author of &quot;Alien 9&quot; and &quot;Milk Closet&quot;.

== Origins ==
There are multiple factors that played a role for Murakami to come up with his Superflat claim. In his Manifesto, he describes “&quot;Super flatness&quot;” as an original concept of Japanese who have been completely Westernized, that simultaneously links the past with the present and the future.

The past, in this case, refers to art made during the Edo period in Japan, where Murakami finds his foremost inspiration in the works of Fine Art painters such as Kano Sansetsu, Ito Jakuchu, Soga Shohaku and Katsushika Hokusai. Murakami explains that his theory was born from a hypothesis created by art historian Nobuo Tsuji in his book &quot;The Lineage of Eccentricity&quot;.

In his book, Tsuji critically analyses works from Edo period painters and explains how the picture controls the speed and course of its observer&#x27;s gaze, creating an interaction between the surface and the viewer with a zigzag motion. This is further elaborated in &quot;Takashi Murakami: Lineage of Eccentrics&quot;, a book that presents key examples of Murakami&#x27;s work alongside a selection of Japanese masterpieces arranged according to the concepts laid out by Tsuji himself. It is mentioned that the juxtaposition of foreground forms extending horizontally across broad compositions and two-dimensional surfaces is another feature that Murakami has adapted for his own theory and contemporary subject matter.

The particular sensibility of the gaze and inspiration from old masters is what Murakami continues to incorporate in his own works. An example of this is his painting called &quot;727&quot;, a work made with acrylics on three panels. In the middle is his alter ego depicted, also known as &#x27;Mr. DOB&#x27;, riding a stylized wave that is a direct reference to Hokusai his famous &quot;Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot;. The panels on which it was painted show a resemblance to the flat and often &#x27;blank&#x27; backgrounds characterizing in Nihonga paintings and folding screens, illustrating features of Superflatness.

Another field within the arts that, according to both Murakami and Tsuji, is closely related to eccentricity of traditional Japanese art and also carries Superflat features, is animation. In his manifesto, Murakami takes Yoshinori Kanada as a prime example of an animator whose work contains a compositional dynamic that resembles that of the “eccentric” artists to a startling degree.

A connection can be made of modern-day animation back to twelfth- and thirteenth-century Japanese handscrolls, where the narrative is composed across multiple sheets of joined paper, read from right to left, providing the observer once again a two-dimensional &#x27;flat&#x27; space and composition where the gaze leads the viewer through the story.

A different factor that played a role for the emergence of Superflatness was the bursting bubble of the Japanese economy in the 1990s, where Japan was led into uncertain territory and a loss of its sense of security. Michael Darling explains that &quot;rabid consumerism and the slavish following of fads, especially in fashion, have further contributed to a culture of surfaces and superficiality, representing still another facet of the Superflat concept&quot;. Darling, 2001). He uses photography and fashion as further examples to illustrate Superflatness and the hype and high consumer demand of Japan.

<text>Leandro Fernández de Moratín (; 10 March 1760 – 21 June 1828) was a Spanish dramatist, translator and neoclassical poet.

==Biography==
Moratín was born in Madrid the son of Nicolás Fernández de Moratín, a major literary reformer in Spain from 1762 until his death in 1828.

Distrusting the teaching offered in Spain&#x27;s universities at the time, Leandro grew up in the rich literary environment of his father and became an admirer of Enlightenment thought. In addition to translating works of Molière and William Shakespeare into Spanish, he himself was a major poet, dramatist and man of letters whose writings promoted the reformist ideas associated with the Spanish Enlightenment. Early in his career, he was supported by statesman and author Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, who, in 1787, arranged for him to study for a year in Paris. In 1792, the Spanish government provided the funds for him to travel to England in order to extend his education. In 1790 he published his first comedy &quot;El viejo y la niña&quot; (&quot;The Old Man and the Young Girl&quot;), a sombre work which attacked the consequences of arranged marriages between people of differing ages. Two years later, in 1792, he wrote the play &quot;La comedia nueva&quot; (&quot;The New Comedy&quot;), a dramatic attack on the extravagant plots used by other contemporary playwrights.

A supporter of Joseph Bonaparte, whose rule had allowed far more expression of liberal thinking than Spain&#x27;s Bourbon monarch Carlos IV was willing to tolerate, Moratín was given the post of royal librarian. However, his 1805 comedy &quot;El sí de las niñas&quot; (&quot;The Maidens&#x27; Consent&quot;) was denounced upon the reinstatement of the Inquisition when Ferdinand VII regained the throne after the fall of the Bonapartes, and he had to abandon playwriting and was forced into exile in France.

Moratín died in Paris and was buried there in the Père Lachaise Cemetery. However, at the turn of the 20th century, his remains were brought back to Spain for interment in Madrid&#x27;s &quot;Panteón de Hombres Ilustres&quot; (&quot;Pantheon of Illustrious Men&quot;).

<doc id="1002084" wikidata="Q176891" url="?curid=1002084" title="Carapicuíba">
<text>Carapicuíba () is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. The population is 403,183 (2020 est.) in an area of . It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in the state of São Paulo.

== History ==
Before the first white man arrived, the region which today is Carapicuíba was inhabited by indigenous people. The hamlet was founded by José de Anchieta. Afonso Sardinha settled there with his farm with the will to use the indigenous people as a workforce. He then built a chapel. The indigenous people soon reacted to the European occupation, and rushed into the jungle. By the 17th century, it was part of the recently created municipality of Santana do Parnaíba. Nothing much has changed in the hamlet during this century and most of the 18th century.

From 1770 on, however, the city and its surroundings started to change noticeably, as new villages were settled, like Embu and Cotia. Houses were built around the main chapel, in which several &quot;entrepreneur&quot; (actually, people who arranged the parties with folklore-related themes) lived.

Until the Sorocabana Railway was implemented, in 1870, little was developed in the village. However, when a station was opened near the section of the tracks that run through the city, many people started to live in the city. During the first half of the 20th century, agriculture started to play a role in the economy of the village, because of the climate and quality of the land. A bus line starting in Barueri, running through Carapicuíba, Osasco and ending in Pinheiros was created to take people to São Paulo in alternate itineraries.

In 1948, Carapicuíba became a district of Cotia, when it became independent from São Paulo. A year later, it became part of Barueri, also as a district.

In 1952 the Parish Nossa Senhora Aparecida was built, and is now known as &quot;Igreja Amarela&quot; (&quot;Yellow Church&quot;), and the city population kept on increasing. The post-war times saw the vertiginous decrease of the prospecting in Minas Gerais, which led a large number of people to go to São Paulo state, a number of them settling in the city.

In the early 1960s, a movement in favor of the independence of Carapicuíba was led by the mayor of Barueri, Carlos Capriotti, and the district earned its city status in March 1965

In 2007-2008, the city gained national attention due to the Paturis Park murders.

=== Origin of the name ===
According to Professor Eduardo de Almeida Navarro, titular professor at the Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humanas of University of São Paulo, the name has a controversial origin and may come from the Tupi or the Paulista General Language and may have different significations:
* &quot;peziza (a fungus that is) inappropriate (to be eaten)&quot; (&quot;karapuku&quot;, peziza + &quot;aíb&quot;, inappropriate + &quot;a&quot;, suffix)
* &quot;carapicus (a fish) rotten (inappropriate to be eaten)&quot; (&quot;akará&quot;, acará + &quot;puku&quot;, long + &quot;aíb&quot;, rotten + &quot;a&quot;, suffix)
* &quot;carapicu tree (a kind of shrub)&quot; (&quot;carapicu&quot;, carapicu + &#x27; &quot;yba&quot;, tree)
Some people say that it may also come from &quot;Quar-I-Picui-Bae&quot;, name given by Indians to a small river delimiting a border between the city with Osasco and Cotia.

== Geography ==
The border with Barueri is a large plain formed by the side of the Rio Tietê. The exploration of sand in the area was so intensive that a large crater was formed. However, during the 1960s, the government of São Paulo state started a series of works to alter the route of the river, and the destruction of the wall between the river and the crater led to the flooding of it. Now, the place has become an artificial lake called &quot;Lagoa de Carapicuíba&quot; (&quot;Carapicuíba Lake&quot;). 8 thousand litres of sewage from the central, western and southern portions of the city of São Paulo pass through the lake towards Barueri. The average altitude is 717 meters and the climate is in general a humid subtropical climate.

== Economy ==

As of 2005, the city has a GDP of R$1,915,285,000.00 and a GDP per capita of R$5,004

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

== Transportation ==

The city is served by the Line 8 of São Paulo commuter rail, having two stations within the area of the municipality and a third one just after the border with Osasco. Three Bus services serve the city: ETT Carapicuíba and Del Rey Transportes, with municipal and inter municipal lines, and Viação Osasco, with intermunicipal lines only.

=== Highways ===
There are no highways crossing Carapicuíba, though the Rodoanel Mário Covas marks most of the border with Osasco and provides some accesses to the city, as well as serving as the main connection to the other highways and the city of São Paulo itself. The Rodovia Castelo Branco passes just north of the city, in Barueri. It is also possible to access Carapicuíba from the Rodovia Raposo Tavares, which runs just south of it in the city of Cotia, and from Osasco via the Avenida dos Autonomistas.

<text>is a novel by Haruki Murakami, published in Japan, by Kodansha, in 1999. An English translation by Philip Gabriel was then published in 2001.

==Plot summary==
Sumire is an aspiring writer who survives on a family stipend and the creative input of her only friend, the novel&#x27;s male narrator and protagonist, known in the text only as &#x27;K&#x27;. K is an elementary school teacher, 25 years old, and in love with Sumire, though she does not quite share his feelings. At a wedding, Sumire meets an ethnic Korean woman, Miu, who is 17 years her senior. The two strike up a conversation and Sumire finds herself attracted to the older woman. This is the first time she has ever been sexually drawn to anybody. Miu soon asks Sumire to come work for her. This meeting and the ensuing relationship between the women leads to Sumire changing: she starts wearing nicer clothes, gets a better apartment, and quits smoking; however, she also develops a writer&#x27;s block.

K suddenly begins to receive letters from Europe written by Sumire. With them, he is able to track Sumire&#x27;s and Miu&#x27;s business travels across the continent. In her last letter, Sumire mentions that instead of coming home as originally planned, she and Miu are to spend some extra time on a Greek island vacationing.

After a short while, K begins to call Sumire&#x27;s house wondering when she will return. The only answer he gets, however, is from her answering machine. He soon gets a surprising call from Miu, who asks him to fly to Greece and mentions that something has happened to Sumire. Miu doesn&#x27;t explain much, but it&#x27;s clear the matter is urgent. The connection is shabby, and their phone connection is soon lost.

K&#x27;s new school year is starting the week after Miu&#x27;s call, but finding Sumire&#x27;s well-being more important, he leaves for Greece the next day. He meets Miu for the first time, and she tells him that Sumire has vanished without a trace. She tells him about the string of events that led to the point of Sumire&#x27;s disappearance, in which Miu was unable to reciprocate physically when Sumire initiated a sexual encounter. Miu is very pleased to have K around, but worries that Sumire may have committed suicide; K reassures her that Sumire would not do that.

Miu leaves the island for Athens in order to get help from the Japanese embassy and to call Sumire&#x27;s parents. K spends a day on the island thinking about Sumire and her fate, coming to a realization that there might be some clue in Sumire&#x27;s writing that Miu mentioned. He finds Sumire&#x27;s computer and a floppy disk that contains two documents, named simply &quot;Document 1&quot; and &quot;Document 2&quot;. One contains Sumire&#x27;s writing about a dream of hers in which she tries and fails to reach a version of her mother, who died when Sumire was young. The other is a story that Miu told her about an event that transformed her 14 years ago. She was trapped in a Ferris wheel overnight and, using her binoculars to see inside her nearby apartment, witnessed another version of herself having a disturbing sexual encounter with a man. The event caused her hair to turn completely white and divested her of sexual urges. Miu says that she feels that she was split in two on that night, and has lost that other part of herself forever. Trying hard to connect the dots, K concludes that both the stories suggest the existence of multiple worlds, and Sumire has left this world and entered a parallel one, perhaps to be with the other version of Miu. He then has a mystical experience during the night.

Miu returns after a couple of days. K feels his time there is up, even though he feels a connection to Miu. Going back to Japan, he returns to his everyday life. In Sumire&#x27;s absence, however, he feels he has lost the only precious thing in his life. He receives another distressed call, this time from his girlfriend who is also a married mother of one of his students. She tells him that her son – a boy nicknamed &quot;Carrot&quot; – had been caught stealing in a supermarket a few times, and she needs his help in order to convince the security guard to let him go without contacting the police. The security guard is unhappy with both Carrot&#x27;s lack of regret for his crime and K&#x27;s outward appearance and manner, which he perceives to be one of an easy lifestyle. After a tedious conversation wherein the guard chastises K for his attitude toward him, he lets Carrot go. K sends the mother home and takes Carrot to a coffee shop. Carrot doesn&#x27;t say anything the whole time. Even so, feeling a sort of connection to him, K tells him the story about Sumire. After dropping Carrot at his mother&#x27;s house, K tells her that he cannot see her anymore.

He continues with his solitary life. Despite their promises to the contrary, he never sees Miu again except for one chance encounter: Miu drives past him in her Jaguar but doesn&#x27;t seem to acknowledge he is there. She has stopped dyeing her hair, and it is now pure white. K senses she is now an &quot;empty shell,&quot; lacking what both Sumire and K were once drawn to about her.

Without warning, K receives a phone call from Sumire, who tells him that she is in the same phone booth near her apartment that she had always called him from. She asks him to come to get her from the phone booth. As with other Murakami works, Sputnik Sweetheart lacks a clear, concise ending.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, &quot;Sputnik Sweetheart&quot; was generally well-received amongst the English press. Globally, &quot;Complete Review&quot; saying on the consensus &quot;Most opinions quite favourable, but a lot of uncertainty about the book&quot;.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote that &quot;worlds of implication exfoliate from this stunning, beautifully structured novel: a moving depiction of the mystery of other people, ever capable of &#x27;disappearing&#x27; into &#x27;places&#x27; where we cannot, try as we may, follow them.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said, of the seventh translation to be provided to Murakami&#x27;s English readership, &quot;His latest offering breaks no new ground but is packaged in a striking manner and should attract a few newcomers.&quot;

Daniel Zalewski, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, remarked on the book&#x27;s tone: &quot;At this more mature stage in his career, Murakami speaks in a subtler language, one that blankets the internal and external world with melancholy.&quot; Julie Myerson, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said that Murakami &quot;surely accomplishes the best, most unnerving job of fiction: to force you to look hard at the parts of yourself you never even suspected were there.&quot;

==Themes==

Murakami explores familiar themes such as the effects of unrequited love, growing up emotionally stunted in an overwhelmingly conformist society, and the conflict between following one&#x27;s dreams and clamping down on them in order to assimilate into society.

While Sumire is an emotional and spontaneous individual who often appears to be a misfit in society, &quot;K&quot;, the narrator, is a person who has through sheer force of will moulded himself into another person, one who integrates seamlessly into the wider society and culture around him, and the transition leaves him emotionally stunted and unable to express his feelings. When Sumire is also, through her interaction with Miu, forcibly shaped into a person other than she is, the transformation is neither permanent nor successful.

As in &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Dance Dance Dance&quot;, Murakami uses (or rather, suggests) alternate worlds as a plot device. &quot;K&quot;, the narrator, is a markedly different protagonist from those of Murakami&#x27;s other novels. He is considerably less given to or adept at wisecracks, maintains a respectable and stable profession as a schoolteacher, and is less self-confident and much more introverted and conflicted than any other Murakami protagonist.

Many elements of the plot remain deliberately unresolved, contributing to the idea that true knowledge is elusive, and actual events of the story are obscured in favour of the characters&#x27; perceptions.

The book ends with the theme of The Telephone, which appears in numerous books by Murakami, usually when telephoning from a far-away place, whose location is unclear.

==In popular culture==

The book is mentioned in the movie Paris, Je T&#x27;aime, while a passage of the book was used in Channel 4&#x27;s TV drama &quot;Nearly Famous&quot; in the UK.

The bands Project Orange and Weatherday named songs after this novel.

<doc id="1002105" wikidata="Q291239" url="?curid=1002105" title="Marguerite Durand">
<text>Marguerite Durand (24 January 1864 – 16 March 1936) was a French stage actress, journalist, and a leading suffragette. She founded her own newspaper, and ran for election. She is also known for having a pet lion. The Bibliothèque Marguerite Durand was named in her honour for her contributions to the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in France.

==Early life and acting career==
Born into a middle-class family on 24 January 1864, Marguerite Durand was sent to study at a Roman Catholic convent. After finishing her primary education, she entered the Conservatoire de Paris before joining the Comédie Française, the oldest active theatre company in the world, in 1881.

In 1888, she gave up her career in the theatre to marry an up-and-coming young lawyer, Georges Laguerre. 

== Politics ==
A friend and follower of the politically ambitious army general Georges Boulanger, her husband introduced her to the world of radical populist politics and involved her in writing pamphlets for the &quot;Boulangists&quot; movement. However, the marriage was short-lived, and in 1891 the couple separated after which Durand took a job writing for &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, the leading newspaper of the day. In 1896, the paper sent her to cover the &quot;Congrès Féministe International&quot; (International Feminist Congress) ostensibly to write a humorous article. She came away from the event a greatly changed person, so much so that the following year on 9 December 1897 she founded a feminist daily newspaper, &quot;La Fronde&quot; to pick up where Hubertine Auclert&#x27;s &quot;La Citoyenne&quot; left off. 

Durand&#x27;s newspaper, run exclusively by women, advocated for women&#x27;s rights, including admission to the Bar association and the . Its editorials demanded that women be allowed to be named to the Legion of Honor and to participate in parliamentary debates. Later in 1910, this came to include Durand&#x27;s attempt to organise female candidates to stand for the legislative elections. However, Durand considered Marie Denizard&#x27;s presidential candidacy in 1913 to be an &quot;unfortunate joke&quot; detrimental to the credibility of the feminist movement.

At the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris, she organised the Congress For The Rights of Women. As well as establishing a summer residence for female journalists in Pierrefonds in the Picardy region, Durand turned to activism for working women, helping to organise several trade unions.

== Image ==
Marguerite Durand, consumed by a passion for the equality of women, was an attractive woman of style and elegance who was famous for walking the streets of Paris with her pet lion she named &quot;Tiger.&quot; Instrumental in the establishing of the zoological Cimetière des Chiens in the Parisian suburb of Asnières-sur-Seine where her lion was eventually interred, her activism raised the profile of feminism in France and Europe to an unprecedented level of respectability.

In the course of her life and activism she compiled an enormous collection of papers that she gave to the government in 1931. The following year, the Bibliothèque Marguerite Durand opened in Paris and still operates as a specialised public library run by the Paris municipal library system, where researchers can work beneath a portrait of Durand.

<text>Catharine Maria Sedgwick (December 28, 1789 – July 31, 1867) was an American novelist of domestic fiction. From the 1820s to the 1850s, Sedgwick made a living writing short stories for a variety of periodicals. She became one of the most notable female novelists of her time. She wrote work in American settings, and combined patriotism with protests against historic Puritan oppressiveness. Her topics contributed to the creation of a national literature, enhanced by her detailed descriptions of nature. Sedgwick created spirited heroines who did not conform to the stereotypical conduct of women at the time. She promoted Republican motherhood.

==Early life and education==

Catharine Maria Sedgwick was born December 28, 1789, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Her mother was Pamela Dwight (1752–1807) of the New England Dwight family, daughter of General Joseph Dwight (1703–1765) and granddaughter of Ephraim Williams, founder of Williams College. Her father was Theodore Sedgwick (1746–1813), a prosperous lawyer and successful politician. He was later elected Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and in 1802, was appointed a justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

Sedgwick&#x27;s four brothers were educated for the law: they naturally followed the profession in which their father, Judge Sedgwick, had been eminent, yet only one of them followed him in the political career in which he had been equally distinguished. The eldest, Theodore, practiced law in Albany, New York and later served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives; Harry and Robert practiced law in New York; Charles, the youngest, practiced in Stockbridge. Her talents seem to have been appreciated by her brothers, Henry and Theodore, whose encouragement was acknowledged in the preface to a new edition of her works in 1849.

As a child, Sedgwick was cared for by Elizabeth Freeman (aka Mumbet), a former slave whose freedom Theodore Sedgwick helped gain by arguing her case in county court in 1781. After winning her freedom Freeman declined her previous owner&#x27;s job offer, and instead accepted a job working for the Sedgwick family.

In her autobiography, Sedgwick refers to Elizabeth Freeman multiple times and reflects upon the influence Freeman had on Sedgwick&#x27;s perception of the world. The integrity and pride that Freeman possessed regarding her own personal intelligence and understanding of the world can be reflected in Sedgwick&#x27;s admiration of the woman.

When Sedgwick was seven or eight, she passed the summer under the care of her cousin Sabrina Parsons in Bennington, Vermont, at the house of the Rev. Mr. Swift, the husband of Sedgwick&#x27;s aunt. At home, she attended the district schools, but no one dictated her studies or overlooked her progress. Reading, spelling, and Dwight&#x27;s Geography were the only subjects taught, in addition to the first four rules of arithmetic, and the names of the several parts of speech. During her first winter in New York, when she was 11 years old, she studied dance under M. Lalliet, and had a French master who came three times a week. About two years later, she attended Mrs. Bell&#x27;s boarding school in Albany, New York, as a day-scholar. At the age of 15, she was sent to Mr. Payne&#x27;s boarding school in Boston to complete her education, and was there for six months. One of her schoolmates, Susan Anne Ridley Sedgwick (1788–1867), would become her sister-in-law and a published author.

==Career==
As a young woman, Sedgwick took charge of a school in Lenox. She converted from Calvinism to Unitarianism, which led her to write a pamphlet denouncing religious intolerance. This further inspired her to write her first novel, &quot;A New-England Tale&quot;. &quot;Redwood&quot; followed in 1824. It was well received, and caused Sedgwick&#x27;s name to be associated, and on equal terms, with that of James Fenimore Cooper, who was then at the height of his popularity. In a French translation of the book, Cooper is given on the title-page as the author. &quot;Redwood&quot; was also translated into the Italian, besides being reprinted in England.

In 1825, Sedgwick published &quot;The Travellers&quot;, a narrative of a journey made by two very young persons, a brother and sister, with their parents, to Niagara Falls and the northern lakes. On their way, these travelers meet everywhere some incident or some sight, which is made the source of entertainment and instruction. This was the first of Sedgwick&#x27;s books intended for young persons and the public gave it a ready welcome. Its success encouraged her in after years to write the series of works intended for young readers which became popular.

The reputation of the author was confirmed and extended by the appearance, in 1827, of &quot;Hope Leslie&quot;, the most decided favourite of all her novels. She wrote other things afterward, that in the opinion of some of the critics are superior to either &quot;Redwood&quot; or &quot;Hope Leslie&quot;. But these later writings had to jostle their way among a crowd of competitors, both domestic and foreign. Her earlier works stood alone, and &quot;Hope Leslie&quot;, especially, became firmly associated in the public mind with the rising form of a native literature. It was not only read with satisfaction but familiarly quoted and applauded as a source of national pride. Her subsequent novels followed at about uniform intervals, &quot;Clarence, a Tale of our Own Times&quot; appearing in 1830.

Sedgwick gives the Native American population a voice within &quot;Hope Leslie&quot; through her characterization of various people within the novel. Similar to the manner in which Sedgwick represented a progressive attitude toward the supposed duties of women during the time period, Philip Gura highlights her addition of minority groups as significant characters and her commitment to questioning the history of the nation that has been told exclusively by white men.

A little later, the Brothers Harper conceived the idea of publishing a collection of tales by several well-known authors, and applied to Sedgwick to become one of the contributors. She complied, and two volumes were published in 1832, with the title of &quot;Tales of the Glauber Spa&quot;. Sedgwick&#x27;s contribution was a tale of the times of Charlemagne, titled &quot;Le Bossu&quot;, in which she skillfully availed herself of the elements of the picturesque to be found in the customs of that warlike age, and the court of that monarch. Then came &quot;The Linwoods, or Sixty Years Since in America&quot;, in 1835. In 1836, she commenced writing in a new vein, giving a series of illustrations of common life, called &quot;The Poor Rich Man, and the Rich Poor Man&quot;. These were followed, in 1837, by &quot;Live and Let Live&quot;, and afterwards by &quot;Means and Ends&quot;, a &quot;Love Token for Children&quot;, and &quot;Stories for Young Persons&quot;. She also published tales in &quot;The Token&quot; annual gift book around this time.

In 1839, Sedgwick went to Europe, and while there, wrote &quot;Letters from Abroad to Kindred at Home&quot;. These were collected after her return and published in two volumes. She also wrote a &quot;Life of Lucretia M. Davidson&quot;, and contributed numerous articles to the Annuals and the Magazines. Some of her publications were prepared expressly for children and young persons. &quot;The Boy of Mount Rhigi&quot;, published in 1848, was one of a series of tales projected for the purpose of diffusing sentiments of goodness among the young. The titles of some of her other small volumes are &quot;Facts and Fancies&quot;, &quot;Beatitudes and Pleasant Sundays&quot;, &quot;Morals of Manners&quot;, &quot;Wilton Harvey&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Louisa and her Cousins&quot;, and &quot;Lessons without Books&quot;. In her final novel, &quot;Married or Single&quot; (1857), she put forth the bold idea that women should not marry if it meant they would lose their self-respect (but she married off her heroine).

In later years, both the brothers who resided in New York City were dead; and her time was divided among her friends in the neighborhood of Boston and those in her native Berkshire. At this time, she wrote &quot;Memoir of Joseph Curtis, a Model Man&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sedgwick was engaged at one point to Harmanus Bleecker, a friend of her father and law partner of her brother Theodore (1780-1839). They did not marry, and Sedgwick turned down several other marriage proposals, instead choosing to remain single and focus on her career.

Sedgwick died in 1867. She is buried in the family plot in Stockbridge. Her family arranged to have Freeman buried in their family plot as well, and had a tombstone inscribed for her.

==Critical response==
By the end of the 19th century, she had been relegated to near obscurity. There was a rise of male critics who denigrated women&#x27;s writing as they worked to create an American literature. Interest in Sedgwick&#x27;s works and an appreciation of her contribution to American literature has been stimulated by the late 20th century&#x27;s feminist movement. Beginning in the 1960s, feminist scholars began to re-evaluate women&#x27;s contributions to literature and other arts and created new frames of reference for considering their work. In addition, the advent of low-cost electronic reproductions, which became available at the end of the 20th century, made Sedgwick and other nineteenth-century authors&#x27; work more accessible for study and pleasure. Edgar Allan Poe described Sedgwick in his &quot;The Literati of New York City&quot; (1846).

She is about the medium height, perhaps a little below it. Her forehead is an unusually fine one nose of a slightly Roman curve; eyes dark and piercing; mouth well-formed and remarkably pleasant in its expression. The portrait in &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot; is by no means a likeness, and, although the hair is represented as curled, (Miss Sedgwick at present wears a cap—at least, most usually,) gives her the air of being much older than she is.

===&quot;The New England Tale&quot;===
Sedgwick&#x27;s first publication was &quot;The New England Tale&quot;. The author informs us in the preface, that the story was commenced as a religious tract, and that it gradually grew in her hands, beyond the proper limits of such a work. Finding this to be the case, she abandoned all design of publication but finished the tale for her own amusement. Once finished, however, the opinions and solicitations of her friends prevailed over her own earnest wishes, and the volume was published in 1822. The original intention of this book led the author to give special prominence to topics of a questionable character for a professed novel, and the unfavourable portraiture which she gives of New England Puritanism, brought some censure upon her. The limited plan of the story did not give the opportunity for the display of that extent and variety of power which appear in some of her later productions. Still, it contains passages of stirring eloquence, as well as of deep tenderness, that compares favourably with her other writings. Perhaps the chief value of &quot;The New England Tale&quot; was its effect upon the author herself. Its publication broke the ice of diffidence and indifference, and launched her career.

===&quot;Hope Leslie&quot;===

Sedgwick&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Hope Leslie&quot; (1827), recounted a dramatic conflict among the British Empire, colonists and Native Americans. The book earned a large readership and established the author&#x27;s reputation in both the United States and Great Britain.

Using the techniques of the &quot;New Criticism&quot; of the 1950s, Judith Fetterley (1998) provides a close reading of &quot;Hope Leslie&quot;. She notes both the areas in which the heroine Leslie (and thus the author) is ahead of her time and the areas in which she is a product of her time. Leslie constantly challenges the role of women suggested during the colonial period. Sedgwick portrays Leslie as living in a hostile world, where, as a woman, she creates a holistic public role that is not separate from the private sphere. Sedgwick regularly uses the rhetoric of &quot;sameness&quot; when comparing Leslie and the main male character, Everell.

Her treatment of her characters is both radical and conservative. For instance, Fetterley believes that Leslie is repulsed to discover that her long-lost sister, Faith Leslie, taken captive by Indians, has &quot;gone native&quot;, assimilated and married an Indian. Sedgwick portrays the Indian woman &quot;Magawisca&quot; sympathetically. But she viewed nonwhite women as a threat to the efforts of white women to establish themselves independently in society, and seemed to write nonwhite women out of the future by expressing the contemporary belief that American Indians were a vanishing race.

Barbara Bardes and Suzanne Gossett differ in opinions about the meaning of &quot;Hope Leslie&quot;. They see the figure of &quot;Magawisca&quot; as a double for Hope Leslie, and note that the author did research on Mohawk customs and presents their religion sympathetically. Because Sedgwick portrays Faith Leslie&#x27;s marriage to an Indian and refusal to rejoin the Puritan community, they see her as more open to American-Native American relations than was James Fenimore Cooper, for instance, whose novel &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1826) was published the year before.

===&quot;Clarence&quot;===

&quot;Clarence; or, A Tale of Our Own Times&quot; (1830) is a novel of manners set in New York City. Portions of the novel also take place in England, Jamaica, and Trenton Falls, a popular tourist destination in New York state. The story follows Gertrude Clarence, a young heiress on the New York City marriage market. An author&#x27;s revised edition of the novel was released in 1849. Critical reception of the novel in America was mostly positive. A review in the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; (14 June 1830) praises the presentations of American domestic life as being &quot;managed with great liveliness and ingenuity, and constitute one of the most attractive parts of the book&quot;. Reviews of the novel in England are mixed. &quot;The Ladies Museum&quot; (1 September 1830) criticizes the novel for being outmoded, complaining that the novel was written &quot;in a style that was considered good fifty years ago&quot;.

===&quot;The Linwoods&quot;===
&quot;The Linwoods; or Sixty Years Since in America&quot; (1835) is a historical romance set during the American Revolution. Sedgwick uses a cosmopolitan framework to shed light on American character and national identity in the early republic by exploring America&#x27;s relationship with Britain and France. The balance between American nationalism and cosmopolitanism is idealized in the novel through the character of the Marquis de Lafayette, as is the struggle between Old World notions of class and the reality of American democracy.

===&quot;Live and Let Live&quot;===

&quot;Live and Let Live; or, Domestic Service Illustrated&quot; (1837) depicts the ideal workplaces for working-class women to develop domestic skills. Sedgwick&#x27;s expression of relations between mistress-employer and housekeepers reflects a return to aristocratic class relations, but one that includes employer respect for the employee&#x27;s humanity and political rights. Domestic economist Catharine Beecher&#x27;s subsequent publications, &quot;A Treatise on Domestic Economy&quot; (1841) and &quot;The American Woman&#x27;s Home&quot; (1869), similarly promoted the importance of the &quot;labor contract&quot; in these relationships.

==Literary style and themes==
Hart in 1857 stated:-&quot;The quality of mind which is most apparent in Miss Sedgwick&#x27;s writings is that of strength. The reader feels at every step that he has to do with a vigorous and active intellect. Another quality, resulting from this possession of power, is the entire absence of affectation of every kind. There is no straining for effect, no mere verbal prettinesses. The discourse proceeds with the utmost simplicity and directness, as though the author were more intent upon what she is saying than how she says it. As a novelist, Sedgwick has for the most part wisely chosen American subjects. The local traditions, scenery, manners, and costume, being thus entirely familiar, she has had greater freedom in the exercise of the creative faculty, on which, after all, real eminence in the art mainly depends. Her characters are conceived with distinctness, and are minutely individual and consistent, while her plot always shows a mind fertile in resources and a happy adaptation of means to ends.&quot;

In 1880, in a Harper and brothers review, it was said:-&quot;Sedgwick has marked individuality; she writes with a higher aim than merely to amuse. Indeed, the rare endowments of her mind depend in an unusual degree upon the moral qualities with which they are united for their value. Animated by a cheerful philosophy, and anxious to pour its sunshine into every place where there is lurking care or suffering, she selects for illustration the scenes of everyday experience, paints them with exact fidelity, and seeks to diffuse over the mind a delicious serenity, and in the heart kind feelings and sympathies, and wise ambition and steady hope. Her style is colloquial, picturesque, and marked by a facile grace which is evidently a gift of nature. Her characters are nicely drawn and delicately contrasted, her delineation of manners decidedly the best that has appeared.

<text>USS &quot;Archerfish&quot; (SS/AGSS-311) was a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine. She was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the archerfish. &quot;Archerfish&quot; is best known for sinking the Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Shinano&quot; in November 1944, the largest warship ever sunk by a submarine. For this achievement, she received a Presidential Unit Citation after World War II.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Archerfish&quot;″s keel was laid down on 22 January 1943 in the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 28 May 1943, sponsored by Miss Malvina Thompson, the personal secretary to first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The boat was commissioned on 4 September 1943.

== World War II ==
&quot;Archerfish&quot; underwent shakedown training through the first part of November off the New England coast, and headed for Hawaii via the Panama Canal. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 November 1943 and joined the Pacific Fleet.

=== First four patrols, December 1943 – September 1944 ===
After receiving voyage repairs and undergoing training exercises, &quot;Archerfish&quot; got under way on 23 December, for her first war patrol. She paused at Midway Atoll on 27 December, to refuel before proceeding to her patrol area north of Taiwan. During this patrol, she attacked three ships, but scored no kills before returning to Midway on 16 February 1944 for repairs and training.

The submarine stood out of Midway on 16 March 1944 on her second war patrol but encountered no Japanese targets during her 42 days at sea, mostly near the Palau Islands. She returned to the Submarine Base at Pearl Harbor via Johnston Island on 27 April, to commence refitting.

A month and a day later, &quot;Archerfish&quot; left Pearl Harbor, bound for the Bonin Islands area and her third patrol. She was assigned lifeguard duty during the strikes against Iwo Jima on 4 July, and rescued downed aviator Ensign John B. Anderson before returning to Midway on 15 July.

After a refit alongside submarine tender and training exercises, &quot;Archerfish&quot; got under way again on 7 August, to begin another patrol. She prowled the waters off Honshū for more than a month without bagging any enemy ships, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 September, after 53 days at sea.

=== Fifth patrol, October–December 1944: Sinking &quot;Shinano&quot; ===
&quot;Archerfish&quot; left Hawaii on 30 October, under the command of Commander Joseph F. Enright, visited Saipan on 9 November, for quick voyage repairs, and departed two days later to carry out her next patrol, in which her primary mission was to provide lifeguard services for the first B-29 Superfortress strikes against Tokyo. On 28 November, she received word that no air raids would be launched that day, giving her carte blanche to roam the waters near Tokyo Bay. That evening, lookouts spotted what looked like a tanker leaving the bay. It was later discovered that it was actually a large aircraft carrier screened by three destroyers (&quot;Hamakaze&quot;, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Isokaze&quot;) and a submarine chaser (&quot;Cha-241&quot;).
Enright ordered the carrier tracked from ahead in preparation for an attack from below. After six hours, the enemy carrier turned back into &quot;Archerfish&quot;″s path, and &quot;Archerfish&quot; got into an attack position. &quot;Archerfish&quot; submerged and fired six torpedoes, four of which found their mark. Enright deliberately set the torpedoes to run shallow () in hopes of capsizing the target by holing it higher up on its hull. He also wanted to increase the chances of a hit in case the torpedoes ran deeper than set. Before &quot;Archerfish&quot; descended to to avoid a depth charge attack, Enright saw that the carrier was listing to starboard. The crew began picking up loud breaking-up noises from the target shortly after firing the last torpedo. The noises continued for 47 minutes.

The patrol ended at Guam on 15 December, after 48 days on station. Initially, the Office of Naval Intelligence thought that &quot;Archerfish&quot; had sunk a cruiser, not believing that there were any carriers in that stretch of ocean. However, Enright had made sketches of the target, and &quot;Archerfish&quot; was given credit for sinking a 28,000-ton carrier.

It was only after the war that the Americans learned the identity of &quot;Archerfish&quot;″s quarry: &quot;Shinano,&quot; the biggest aircraft carrier ever built at the time. It was originally the third of the s, but had been converted into a 72,000-ton supercarrier after the Battle of Midway. Four of &quot;Archerfish&quot;″s six torpedoes had hit, striking the carrier between the anti-torpedo bulge and the waterline at approximately 03:20. The damage was magnified by the fact that &quot;Shinano&quot; had turned south just minutes before Enright loosed his torpedoes, thus exposing her entire side to &quot;Archerfish&quot;—a nearly ideal firing situation for a submarine. The ship initially continued under way, but it lost power around 06:00. The crew were unable to contain the flooding due to serious design flaws and inexperience, and the carrier capsized just before 11:00. &quot;Archerfish&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation and Enright received the Navy Cross for this action. &quot;Shinano&quot; is the largest warship to be sunk by a submarine.

=== Last two patrols, January–September 1945 ===
While her officers and crew spent the holidays at a rest and recreation camp located on Guam, &quot;Archerfish&quot; underwent refit at the island. On 10 January 1945, the submarine got underway for her sixth patrol. Enright was in command of &quot;Joe&#x27;s Jugheads&quot;, a three-submarine &quot;wolfpack&quot; comprising &quot;Archerfish&quot;, , and . 
This mission took her to waters in the South China Sea off Hong Kong and the southern tip of Formosa. She damaged one unidentified target and claimed a submarine on 14 February 1945 during this patrol which ended on 3 March, three days earlier than scheduled, due to bow-plane problems. (The submarine sinking was not confirmed until after the war.) &quot;Archerfish&quot; touched at Saipan and Pearl Harbor before arriving back in the United States at San Francisco, California on 13 March. She then proceeded to the Hunters Point Navy Yard for overhaul and drydocking.
Following completion of the yard work, &quot;Archerfish&quot; sailed on 14 June, for Oahu. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 June, and commenced voyage repairs and training exercises. The submarine got underway on 10 July, for her seventh and last war patrol, which she conducted in the area off the east coast of Honshū and the south coast of Hokkaidō, providing lifeguard services for Superfortresses striking the Japanese home islands. She was still off Hokkaidō on 15 August, when word of the Japanese capitulation arrived. &quot;Archerfish&quot; was one of 12 submarines that entered Tokyo Bay on 31 August, and moored alongside Tender USS Proteus (AS-19), near the Yokosuka Navy Yard. After the formal Japanese surrender on 2 September, &quot;Archerfish&quot; departed Tokyo Bay, bound for Pearl Harbor, and arrived there on 12 September. She was then assigned to Submarine Squadron 1 (SubRon 1) for duty and training.

===Post-war===
The submarine left Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1946, bound for San Francisco. From 8 January, to 13 March, the ship&#x27;s force carried out her preinactivation overhaul. On the latter day, she proceeded to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard where the final stages of inactivation were completed. &quot;Archerfish&quot; was decommissioned on 12 June 1946 and placed in the Pacific Reserve Group berthed at Mare Island.

== 1952–1955 ==
During the Korean War, many inactive Navy vessels were recommissioned. &quot;Archerfish&quot; was chosen for recommissioning on 7 January 1952. She was recommissioned on 7 March and reported for duty to the Pacific Fleet on 26 March. The next day she sailed for three weeks of shakedown training out of San Diego, California. However, a fire broke out in her maneuvering room on 28 March, and the ship returned to Mare Island under her own power for a restricted availability to have the damage corrected.

With repairs complete on 27 May, &quot;Archerfish&quot; held shakedown off the West Coast. She then transited the Panama Canal and joined the Atlantic Fleet on 3 July. Attached to SubRon 12, she operated out of Key West, Florida, visiting such places as Santiago and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba; Port-au-Prince, Haiti; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Trinidad, British West Indies. The vessel departed Key West on 25 April 1955 and proceeded to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for decommissioning. After completing her inactivation overhaul, the ship was towed to Atlantic Reserve Fleet, New London in New London, Connecticut, and was decommissioned on 21 October 1955.

== Oceanographic work, 1958–1964 ==
&quot;Archerfish&quot; was reactivated at New London in July 1957, placed back in commission on 1 August, and again joined SubRon 12 at Key West. On 13 January 1958, she got underway for a cruise under the technical supervision of the Navy Hydrographic Office. On this deployment, she visited Recife, Brazil, and Trinidad. Upon completion of that mission she provided services for the fleet training commands at Key West and Guantánamo Bay. (In this time, she also portrayed the in the 1959 movie &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; for the underwater and distance scenes and shots.)

On 2 October 1959, approximately 15 miles southwest of Key West, over Vestal Shoal, &quot;Archerfish&quot; bottomed at . Commander George F. Bond and Chief Engineman Cyril Tuckfield safely completed a 52-second, 302-foot buoyant ascent from the forward escape trunk. Both men received the Legion of Merit in 1960 for establishing the feasibility of deep submarine escape by locking out.

In early 1960, &quot;Archerfish&quot; was chosen to participate in Operation &quot;Sea Scan&quot;, a scientific study of marine weather conditions, water composition, ocean depths, and temperature ranges. She entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in January to be specially equipped for this new mission. During this time, the vessel was redesignated an auxiliary submarine, with hull classification symbol AGSS-311. Embarking a team of civilian scientists, she commenced the first phase of &quot;Sea Scan&quot; on 18 May. On the cruise, the submarine visited Portsmouth, England; Hammerfest and Bergen, Norway; Faslane, Scotland; Thule, Godthaab, and Julianehab, Greenland; Belfast, Northern Ireland; and Halifax, Nova Scotia, before mooring at New London on 3 December.

After six weeks of upkeep, &quot;Archerfish&quot; got underway on 20 January 1961 for the Pacific phase of &quot;Sea Scan&quot;, transited the Panama Canal on 6 February, and proceeded via San Diego to Hawaii. She left Pearl Harbor on 27 March. During her operations the submarine visited Yokosuka and Hakodate, Japan, Hong Kong; Subic Bay, Philippines; Bangkok, Thailand; Penang, Malaya; Colombo, Ceylon; and Fremantle, Australia, and closed out 1961 moored at Yokosuka.

Phase two of Operation &quot;Sea Scan&quot; continued during the early months of 1962 with operations in the western Pacific area and port calls at Sasebo, Japan, Guam, and Cebu City, Philippines. Early in March, the submarine completed phase two and proceeded via Pago Pago to Pearl Harbor. On 27 April, she entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for overhaul. After completion of overhaul, the submarine moved to San Diego for a two-week upkeep. She then commenced phase three of &quot;Sea Scan&quot; in the eastern Pacific area, with stops in Pearl Harbor and Midway Atoll, and returned to San Diego for the Christmas holidays.

&quot;Archerfish&quot; departed San Diego on 10 January 1963, bound for Yokosuka, where she began a three-week upkeep period. Following two and one-half months of operations she returned to the United States for a brief visit to San Francisco, California, before reentering Pearl Harbor early in May. Late May and most of June were devoted to surveying off the northwest coast of the United States and Canada, with port calls in Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; and Vancouver, British Columbia. The submarine was back in Yokosuka for drydocking in July and August before beginning three months of continuous surveying in the mid-Pacific, broken only by brief fuelling and upkeep stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor. She departed Yokosuka on 25 November, for an extended cruise to the southern hemisphere, arrived in Australia in mid-December and took a three-week holiday in Newcastle and Sydney. From the latter port, &quot;Archerfish&quot; travelled to Guam for a two-week upkeep in late January 1964 and finally reached Pearl Harbor on 5 March.

Departing Pearl Harbor on 30 March, the ship continued &quot;Sea Scan&quot; operations in the eastern Pacific. She visited San Francisco in April and Vancouver, in May before returning to Pearl Harbor on 25 May, ending the third phase of &quot;Sea Scan&quot;.

&quot;Archerfish&quot; began an extended fourth and final phase of Operation &quot;Sea Scan&quot; when she left Pearl Harbor on 17 June, and headed for the eastern Pacific. She made port calls during July at Seattle and Olympia, Washington, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 19 August, for a three-week upkeep and drydocking before undertaking a cruise to the South Pacific. The submarine sailed on 9 September, for the Fiji Islands. After briefly touching Suva, she headed for Auckland, New Zealand, for an 11-day visit. Her next stop was Wellington, New Zealand, but she left New Zealand on 19 October, and arrived in Yokosuka on 6 November. She got underway again on 27 November, to continue survey operations in the Caroline Islands area. After spending New Year&#x27;s Eve in Guam, the ship sailed for Subic Bay, Philippines, where she closed the year in upkeep.

== 1965–1968 ==
During the remaining three and a half years of her Navy career &quot;Archerfish&quot; carried out various research assignments in the eastern Pacific. In early 1968, &quot;Archerfish&quot; was declared unfit for further naval service and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1968. She was towed to a target position off San Diego and sunk by a torpedo fired from the submarine on 19 October 1968.

<text>The charge of high crimes and misdemeanors covers allegations of misconduct by officials. Offenses by officials also include ordinary crimes, but perhaps with different standards of proof and punishment than for non-officials, on the grounds that more is expected of officials by their oaths of office.

== United Kingdom ==
The impeachment of the King&#x27;s Chancellor, Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk in 1386 was the first case to use this charge. One charge under this heading alleged that de la Pole broke a promise to Parliament to follow the advice of a committee regarding improvement of the kingdom. Another charge said that because he failed to pay a ransom for Ghent, the city fell to the French.

The 1450 impeachment of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, a descendant of Michael, was the next to allege charges under this title. He was charged with using his influence to obstruct justice as well as cronyism and wasting public money. Other charges against him included acts of high treason.

Impeachment fell out of use after 1459, but Parliament revived it in the early 17th century to try the King&#x27;s ministers. In 1621, Parliament impeached the King&#x27;s Attorney General, Sir Henry Yelverton, for high crimes and misdemeanors. The charges included failing to prosecute after starting lawsuits and using authority before it was properly his.

In 1640, at the beginning of the Long Parliament, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, was impeached for &quot;high misdemeanours&quot; regarding his conduct in Ireland. Despite the repeated assurances of King Charles I, Strafford was eventually executed (&quot;Put not your trust in princes.&quot;) the following year.

After the Restoration, the scope of the charge grew to include negligence and abuse of power or trust while in office. For example, charges in the impeachment of Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford in 1701 included many violations of trust in his positions. In this case, he abused his position in the Privy Council to make profits for himself; as Treasurer of the Navy he embezzled funds; and as Admiral of the Fleet he got a commission for the pirate William Kidd.

== United States ==
&quot;High crimes and misdemeanors&quot; is a phrase from Section 4 of Article Two of the United States Constitution: &quot;The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other &quot;high Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot;.&quot;

&quot;High,&quot; in the legal and common vocabulary of the 17th and 18th centuries of &quot;high crimes,&quot; is the activity by or against those who have special duties acquired by taking an oath of office that is not shared with ordinary persons. A high crime can be done only by someone in a unique position of authority, which is political, who does things to circumvent justice. The phrase &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors,&quot; used together, was a common phrase when the U.S. Constitution was written and did not require any stringent or demanding criteria for determining guilt. The phrase was historically used to cover an extensive range of crimes.

The Judiciary Committee&#x27;s 1974 report &quot;The Historical Origins of Impeachment&quot; stated: &quot;&#x27;High Crimes and Misdemeanors&#x27; has traditionally been considered a &#x27;term of art&#x27;, like such other constitutional phrases as &#x27;levying war&#x27; and &#x27;due process.&#x27; The Supreme Court has held that such phrases must be construed, not according to modern usage, but according to what the framers meant when they adopted them. In 1807, Chief Justice John Marshall wrote of the phrase &quot;levying war&quot;:

Since 1386, the English Parliament had used the term &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; to describe one of the grounds to impeach officials of the crown. Officials accused of &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; were accused of offenses as varied as misappropriating government funds, appointing unfit subordinates, not prosecuting cases, promoting themselves ahead of more deserving candidates, threatening a grand jury, disobeying an order from Parliament, arresting a man to keep him from running for Parliament, helping &quot;suppress petitions to the King to call a Parliament,&quot; etc.

Benjamin Franklin asserted that the power of impeachment and removal was necessary for those times when the Executive &quot;rendered himself obnoxious,&quot; and the Constitution should provide for the &quot;regular punishment of the Executive when his conduct should deserve it, and for his honorable acquittal when he should be unjustly accused.&quot; James Madison said that &quot;impeachment... was indispensable&quot; to defend the community against &quot;the incapacity, negligence or perfidy of the chief Magistrate.&quot; With a single executive, Madison argued, unlike a legislature whose collective nature provided security, &quot;loss of capacity or corruption was more within the compass of probable events, and either of them might be fatal to the Republic.&quot;

The process of impeaching someone in the House of Representatives and convicting in the Senate is complex, made to be the balance against efforts to remove people from office for minor reasons that could easily be determined by the standard of &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot;. It was George Mason who offered up the term &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; as one of the criteria to remove public officials who abuse their office. Their original intentions can be gleaned by the phrases and words that were proposed before, such as &quot;high misdemeanor,&quot; &quot;maladministration,&quot; or &quot;other crime.&quot; Edmund Randolph said impeachment should be reserved for those who &quot;misbehave.&quot; Charles Cotesworth Pinckney said, It should be reserved &quot;for those who behave amiss, or betray their public trust.&quot; As can be seen from all these references to &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors,&quot; the definition or its rationale does not relate to specific offenses. This gives much freedom of interpretation to the House of Representatives and the Senate. Constitutional law, by nature, is not concerned with being specific. The courts, through precedence and the legislature, through lawmaking, make constitutional provisions clear. In this case, the legislature (the House of Representatives and the Senate) acts as a court and can create a precedent.

In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Hamilton said, &quot;those offences which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.&quot;

The first impeachment conviction by the United States Senate was in 1804 of John Pickering, a judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, for chronic intoxication. Federal judges have been impeached and removed from office for tax evasion, conspiracy to solicit a bribe, and making false statements to a grand jury.

President Andrew Johnson was impeached on February 24, 1868, in the United U.S. House of Representatives on eleven articles of impeachment detailing his &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot;, in accordance with Article Two of the United States Constitution. (The Senate fell one vote short of conviction.) The House&#x27;s primary charge against Johnson was with violation of the Tenure of Office Act, passed by Congress the previous year. Specifically, he had removed Edwin M. Stanton, the Secretary of War from office and replaced him with John Schofield, but it was unclear if Johnson had violated the act as Stanton was nominated by President Abraham Lincoln and not by Johnson.

During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1999, White House Counsel Charles Ruff described a &quot;narrow&quot; interpretation of &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; as requiring &quot;a standard that the framers intentionally set at this extraordinarily high level to ensure that only the most serious offenses and in particular those that subverted our system of government would justify overturning a popular election&quot;. Writing in 1999, Mark R. Slusar commented that the narrow interpretation seemed most common among legal scholars and senators.

Alejandro Mayorkas was impeached in 2024 but the Senate ended the trial without determining guilt after deciding that the articles of impeachment did not allege high crimes and misdemeanors and so did not constitute a valid impeachment.

<doc id="1002128" wikidata="Q58353" url="?curid=1002128" title="Giant magnetoresistance">
<text>Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is a quantum mechanical magnetoresistance effect observed in multilayers composed of alternating ferromagnetic and non-magnetic conductive layers. The 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg for the discovery of GMR, which also sets the foundation for the study of spintronics.

The effect is observed as a significant change in the electrical resistance depending on whether the magnetization of adjacent ferromagnetic layers are in a parallel or an antiparallel alignment. The overall resistance is relatively low for parallel alignment and relatively high for antiparallel alignment. The magnetization direction can be controlled, for example, by applying an external magnetic field. The effect is based on the dependence of electron scattering on spin orientation.

The main application of GMR is in magnetic field sensors, which are used to read data in hard disk drives, biosensors, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and other devices. GMR multilayer structures are also used in magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) as cells that store one bit of information.

In literature, the term giant magnetoresistance is sometimes confused with colossal magnetoresistance of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic semiconductors, which is not related to a multilayer structure.
The founding results of [[Albert Fert]] and [[Peter Grünberg]] (1988): change in the resistance of Fe/Cr superlattices at 4.2 K in external magnetic field H. The current and magnetic field were parallel to the [[miller indices|[110]]] axis. The arrow to the right shows maximum resistance change. &quot;H&quot;s is saturation field.

==Formulation==
Magnetoresistance is the dependence of the electrical resistance of a sample on the strength of an external magnetic field. Numerically, it is characterized by the value

: formula_1

where R(H) is the resistance of the sample in a magnetic field H, and R(0) corresponds to H = 0. Alternative forms of this expression may use electrical resistivity instead of resistance, a different sign for δH, and are sometimes normalized by R(H) rather than R(0).

The term &quot;giant magnetoresistance&quot; indicates that the value δH for multilayer structures significantly exceeds the anisotropic magnetoresistance, which has a typical value within a few percent.

==History==
GMR was discovered in 1988 independently by the groups of Albert Fert of the University of Paris-Sud, France, and Peter Grünberg of Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany. The practical significance of this experimental discovery was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Fert and Grünberg in 2007.

===Early steps===
The first mathematical model describing the effect of magnetization on the mobility of charge carriers in solids, related to the spin of those carriers, was reported in 1936. Experimental evidence of the potential enhancement of δH has been known since the 1960s. By the late 1980s, the anisotropic magnetoresistance had been well explored, but the corresponding value of δH did not exceed a few percent. The enhancement of δH became possible with the advent of sample preparation techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy, which allows manufacturing multilayer thin films with a thickness of several nanometers.

==Experiment and its interpretation==
Fert and Grünberg studied electrical resistance of structures incorporating ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic materials. In particular, Fert worked on multilayer films, and Grünberg in 1986 discovered the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in Fe/Cr films.

The GMR discovery work was carried out by the two groups on slightly different samples. The Fert group used (001)Fe/(001) Cr superlattices wherein the Fe and Cr layers were deposited in a high vacuum on a (001) GaAs substrate kept at 20 °C and the magnetoresistance measurements were taken at low temperature (typically 4.2 K). The Grünberg work was performed on multilayers of Fe and Cr on (110) GaAs at room temperature.

In Fe/Cr multilayers with 3-nm-thick iron layers, increasing the thickness of the non-magnetic Cr layers from 0.9 to 3 nm weakened the antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe layers and reduced the demagnetization field, which also decreased when the sample was heated from 4.2 K to room temperature. Changing the thickness of the non-magnetic layers led to a significant reduction of the residual magnetization in the hysteresis loop. Electrical resistance changed by up to 50% with the external magnetic field at 4.2 K. Fert named the new effect giant magnetoresistance, to highlight its difference with the anisotropic magnetoresistance. The
Grünberg experiment made the same discovery but the effect was less pronounced (3% compared to 50%) due to the samples being at room temperature rather than low temperature.

The discoverers suggested that the effect is based on spin-dependent scattering of electrons in the superlattice, particularly on the dependence of resistance of the layers on the relative orientations of magnetization and electron spins. The theory of GMR for different directions of the current was developed in the next few years. In 1989, Camley and Barnaś calculated the &quot;current in plane&quot; (CIP) geometry, where the current flows along the layers, in the classical approximation, whereas Levy &quot;et al.&quot; used the quantum formalism. The theory of the GMR for the current perpendicular to the layers (current perpendicular to the plane or CPP geometry), known as the Valet-Fert theory, was reported in 1993. Applications favor the CPP geometry because it provides a greater magnetoresistance ratio (δH), thus resulting in a greater device sensitivity.

==Theory==
===Fundamentals===
====Spin-dependent scattering====
In magnetically ordered materials, the electrical resistance is crucially affected by scattering of electrons on the magnetic sublattice of the crystal, which is formed by crystallographically equivalent atoms with nonzero magnetic moments. Scattering depends on the relative orientations of the electron spins and those magnetic moments: it is weakest when they are parallel and strongest when they are antiparallel; it is relatively strong in the paramagnetic state, in which the magnetic moments of the atoms have random orientations.

For good conductors such as gold or copper, the Fermi level lies within the &quot;sp&quot; band, and the &quot;d&quot; band is completely filled. In ferromagnets, the dependence of electron-atom scattering on the orientation of their magnetic moments is related to the filling of the band responsible for the magnetic properties of the metal, e.g., 3&quot;d&quot; band for iron, nickel or cobalt. The &quot;d&quot; band of ferromagnets is split, as it contains a different number of electrons with spins directed up and down. Therefore, the density of electronic states at the Fermi level is also different for spins pointing in opposite directions. The Fermi level for majority-spin electrons is located within the &quot;sp&quot; band, and their transport is similar in ferromagnets and non-magnetic metals. For minority-spin electrons the &quot;sp&quot; and &quot;d&quot; bands are hybridized, and the Fermi level lies within the &quot;d&quot; band. The hybridized &quot;spd&quot; band has a high density of states, which results in stronger scattering and thus shorter mean free path λ for minority-spin than majority-spin electrons. In cobalt-doped nickel, the ratio λ↑/λ↓ can reach 20.

According to the Drude theory, the conductivity is proportional to λ, which ranges from several to several tens of nanometers in thin metal films. Electrons &quot;remember&quot; the direction of spin within the so-called spin relaxation length (or spin diffusion length), which can significantly exceed the mean free path. Spin-dependent transport refers to the dependence of electrical conductivity on the spin direction of the charge carriers. In ferromagnets, it occurs due to electron transitions between the unsplit 4&quot;s&quot; and split 3&quot;d&quot; bands.

In some materials, the interaction between electrons and atoms is the weakest when their magnetic moments are antiparallel rather than parallel. A combination of both types of materials can result in a so-called inverse GMR effect.
====CIP and CPP geometries====
Electric current can be passed through magnetic superlattices in two ways. In the current in plane (CIP) geometry, the current flows along the layers, and the electrodes are located on one side of the structure. In the current perpendicular to plane (CPP) configuration, the current is passed perpendicular to the layers, and the electrodes are located on different sides of the superlattice. The CPP geometry results in more than twice higher GMR, but is more difficult to realize in practice than the CIP configuration.

====Carrier transport through a magnetic superlattice====
Magnetic ordering differs in superlattices with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interaction between the layers. In the former case, the magnetization directions are the same in different ferromagnetic layers in the absence of applied magnetic field, whereas in the latter case, opposite directions alternate in the multilayer. Electrons traveling through the ferromagnetic superlattice interact with it much weaker when their spin directions are opposite to the magnetization of the lattice than when they are parallel to it. Such anisotropy is not observed for the antiferromagnetic superlattice; as a result, it scatters electrons stronger than the ferromagnetic superlattice and exhibits a higher electrical resistance.

Applications of the GMR effect require dynamic switching between the parallel and antiparallel magnetization of the layers in a superlattice. In first approximation, the energy density of the interaction between two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer is proportional to the scalar product of their magnetizations:

: formula_2

The coefficient &quot;J&quot; is an oscillatory function of the thickness of the non-magnetic layer ds; therefore &quot;J&quot; can change its magnitude and sign. If the ds value corresponds to the antiparallel state then an external field can switch the superlattice from the antiparallel state (high resistance) to the parallel state (low resistance). The total resistance of the structure can be written as

: formula_3

where R0 is the resistance of ferromagnetic superlattice, ΔR is the GMR increment and θ is the angle between the magnetizations of adjacent layers.

===Mathematical description===
The GMR phenomenon can be described using two spin-related conductivity channels corresponding to the conduction of electrons, for which the resistance is minimum or maximum. The relation between them is often defined in terms of the coefficient of the spin anisotropy β. This coefficient can be defined using the minimum and maximum of the specific electrical resistivity ρF± for the spin-polarized current in the form

: formula_4

where &quot;ρF&quot; is the average resistivity of the ferromagnet.

====Resistor model for CIP and CPP structures====
If scattering of charge carriers at the interface between the ferromagnetic and non-magnetic metal is small, and the direction of the electron spins persists long enough, it is convenient to consider a model in which the total resistance of the sample is a combination of the resistances of the magnetic and non-magnetic layers.

In this model, there are two conduction channels for electrons with various spin directions relative to the magnetization of the layers. Therefore, the equivalent circuit of the GMR structure consists of two parallel connections corresponding to each of the channels. In this case, the GMR can be expressed as

: formula_5

Here the subscript of R denote collinear and oppositely oriented magnetization in layers, &quot;χ = b/a&quot; is the thickness ratio of the magnetic and non-magnetic layers, and ρN is the resistivity of non-magnetic metal. This expression is applicable for both CIP and CPP structures. Under the condition formula_6 this relationship can be simplified using the coefficient of the spin asymmetry

: formula_7

Such a device, with resistance depending on the orientation of electron spin, is called a spin valve. It is &quot;open&quot;, if the magnetizations of its layers are parallel, and &quot;closed&quot; otherwise.

====Valet-Fert model====
In 1993, Thierry Valet and Albert Fert presented a model for the giant magnetoresistance in the CPP geometry, based on the Boltzmann equations. In this model the chemical potential inside the magnetic layer is split into two functions, corresponding to electrons with spins parallel and antiparallel to the magnetization of the layer. If the non-magnetic layer is sufficiently thin then in the external field E0 the amendments to the electrochemical potential and the field inside the sample will take the form

: formula_8
: formula_9

where &quot;ℓ&quot;s is the average length of spin relaxation, and the z coordinate is measured from the boundary between the magnetic and non-magnetic layers (z &lt; 0 corresponds to the ferromagnetic). Thus electrons with a larger chemical potential will accumulate at the boundary of the ferromagnet. This can be represented by the potential of spin accumulation &quot;V&quot;AS or by the so-called interface resistance (inherent to the boundary between a ferromagnet and non-magnetic material)

: formula_10

where &quot;j&quot; is current density in the sample, &quot;ℓ&quot;sN and &quot;ℓ&quot;sF are the length of the spin relaxation in a non-magnetic and magnetic materials, respectively.

==Device preparation==
===Materials and experimental data===
Many combinations of materials exhibit GMR; the most common are the following:

* FeCr
* Co10Cu90: δH = 40% at room temperature
* [110]Co95Fe5/Cu: δH = 110% at room temperature.

The magnetoresistance depends on many parameters such as the geometry of the device (CIP or CPP), its temperature, and the thicknesses of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers. At a temperature of 4.2 K and a thickness of cobalt layers of 1.5 nm, increasing the thickness of copper layers dCu from 1 to 10 nm decreased δH from 80 to 10% in the CIP geometry. Meanwhile, in the CPP geometry the maximum of δH (125%) was observed for dCu = 2.5 nm, and increasing dCu to 10 nm reduced δH to 60% in an oscillating manner.

When a Co(1.2 nm)/Cu(1.1 nm) superlattice was heated from near zero to 300 K, its δH decreased from 40 to 20% in the CIP geometry, and from 100 to 55% in the CPP geometry.

The non-magnetic layers can be non-metallic. For example, δH up to 40% was demonstrated for organic layers at 11 K. Graphene spin valves of various designs exhibited δH of about 12% at 7 K and 10% at 300 K, far below the theoretical limit of 109%.

The GMR effect can be enhanced by spin filters that select electrons with a certain spin orientation; they are made of metals such as cobalt. For a filter of thickness &quot;t&quot; the change in conductivity ΔG can be expressed as

: formula_11

where ΔGSV is change in the conductivity of the spin valve without the filter, ΔGf is the maximum increase in conductivity with the filter, and β is a parameter of the filter material.

===Types of GMR===
GMR is often classed by the type of devices which exhibit the effect.

====Films====
=====Antiferromagnetic superlattices=====
GMR in films was first observed by Fert and Grünberg in a study of superlattices composed of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers. The thickness of the non-magnetic layers was chosen such that the interaction between the layers was antiferromagnetic and the magnetization in adjacent magnetic layers was antiparallel. Then an external magnetic field could make the magnetization vectors parallel thereby affecting the electrical resistance of the structure.

Magnetic layers in such structures interact through antiferromagnetic coupling, which results in the oscillating dependence of the GMR on the thickness of the non-magnetic layer. In the first magnetic field sensors using antiferromagnetic superlattices, the saturation field was very large, up to tens of thousands of oersteds, due to the strong antiferromagnetic interaction between their layers (made of chromium, iron or cobalt) and the strong anisotropy fields in them. Therefore, the sensitivity of the devices was very low. The use of permalloy for the magnetic and silver for the non-magnetic layers lowered the saturation field to tens of oersteds.

=====Spin valves using exchange bias=====
In the most successful spin valves the GMR effect originates from exchange bias. They comprise a sensitive layer, &quot;fixed&quot; layer and an antiferromagnetic layer. The last layer freezes the magnetization direction in the &quot;fixed&quot; layer. The sensitive and antiferromagnetic layers are made thin to reduce the resistance of the structure. The valve reacts to the external magnetic field by changing the magnetization direction in the sensitive layer relatively to the &quot;fixed&quot; layer.

The main difference of these spin valves from other multilayer GMR devices is the monotonic dependence of the amplitude of the effect on the thickness &quot;dN&quot; of the non-magnetic layers:

: formula_12

where δH0 is a normalization constant, λN is the mean free path of electrons in the non-magnetic material, &quot;d&quot;0 is effective thickness that includes interaction between layers. The dependence on the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer can be given as:

: formula_13

The parameters have the same meaning as in the previous equation, but they now refer to the ferromagnetic layer.

=====Non-interacting multilayers (pseudospin valves)=====
GMR can also be observed in the absence of antiferromagnetic coupling layers. In this case, the magnetoresistance results from the differences in the coercive forces (for example, it is smaller for permalloy than cobalt). In multilayers such as permalloy/Cu/Co/Cu the external magnetic field switches the direction of saturation magnetization to parallel in strong fields and to antiparallel in weak fields. Such systems exhibit a lower saturation field and a larger δH than superlattices with antiferromagnetic coupling. A similar effect is observed in Co/Cu structures. The existence of these structures means that GMR does not require interlayer coupling, and can originate from a distribution of the magnetic moments that can be controlled by an external field.

=====Inverse GMR effect=====
In the inverse GMR, the resistance is minimum for the antiparallel orientation of the magnetization in the layers. Inverse GMR is observed when the magnetic layers are composed of different materials, such as NiCr/Cu/Co/Cu. The resistivity for electrons with opposite spins can be written as formula_14; it has different values, i.e. different coefficients β, for spin-up and spin-down electrons. If the NiCr layer is not too thin, its contribution may exceed that of the Co layer, resulting in inverse GMR. Note that the GMR inversion depends on the sign of the &quot;product&quot; of the coefficients β in adjacent ferromagnetic layers, but not on the signs of individual coefficients.

Inverse GMR is also observed if NiCr alloy is replaced by vanadium-doped nickel, but not for doping of nickel with iron, cobalt, manganese, gold or copper.

====GMR in granular structures====
GMR in granular alloys of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic metals was discovered in 1992 and subsequently explained by the spin-dependent scattering of charge carriers at the surface and in the bulk of the grains. The grains form ferromagnetic clusters about 10 nm in diameter embedded in a non-magnetic metal, forming a kind of superlattice. A necessary condition for the GMR effect in such structures is poor mutual solubility in its components (e.g., cobalt and copper). Their properties strongly depend on the measurement and annealing temperature. They can also exhibit inverse GMR.

==Applications==
===Spin-valve sensors===
====General principle====
One of the main applications of GMR materials is in magnetic field sensors, e.g., in hard disk drives and biosensors, as well as detectors of oscillations in MEMS. A typical GMR-based sensor consists of seven layers:

#Silicon substrate,
#Binder layer,
#Sensing (non-fixed) layer,
#Non-magnetic layer,
#Fixed layer,
#Antiferromagnetic (pinning) layer,
#Protective layer.

The binder and protective layers are often made of tantalum, and a typical non-magnetic material is copper. In the sensing layer, magnetization can be reoriented by the external magnetic field; it is typically made of NiFe or cobalt alloys. FeMn or NiMn can be used for the antiferromagnetic layer. The fixed layer is made of a magnetic material such as cobalt. Such a sensor has an asymmetric hysteresis loop owing to the presence of the magnetically hard, fixed layer.

Spin valves may exhibit anisotropic magnetoresistance, which leads to an asymmetry in the sensitivity curve.

====Hard disk drives====
In hard disk drives (HDDs), information is encoded using magnetic domains, and a change in the direction of their magnetization is associated with the logical level 1 while no change represents a logical 0. There are two recording methods: longitudinal and perpendicular.

In the longitudinal method, the magnetization is normal to the surface. A transition region (domain walls) is formed between domains, in which the magnetic field exits the material. If the domain wall is located at the interface of two north-pole domains then the field is directed outward, and for two south-pole domains it is directed inward. To read the direction of the magnetic field above the domain wall, the magnetization direction is fixed normal to the surface in the antiferromagnetic layer and parallel to the surface in the sensing layer. Changing the direction of the external magnetic field deflects the magnetization in the sensing layer. When the field tends to align the magnetizations in the sensing and fixed layers, the electrical resistance of the sensor decreases, and vice versa.

===Magnetic RAM===
A cell of magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) has a structure similar to the spin-valve sensor. The value of the stored bits can be encoded via the magnetization direction in the sensor layer; it is read by measuring the resistance of the structure. The advantages of this technology are independence of power supply (the information is preserved when the power is switched off owing to the potential barrier for reorienting the magnetization), low power consumption and high speed.

In a typical GMR-based storage unit, a CIP structure is located between two wires oriented perpendicular to each other. These conductors are called lines of rows and columns. Pulses of electric current passing through the lines generate a vortex magnetic field, which affects the GMR structure. The field lines have ellipsoid shapes, and the field direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) is determined by the direction of the current in the line. In the GMR structure, the magnetization is oriented along the line.

The direction of the field produced by the line of the column is almost parallel to the magnetic moments, and it can not reorient them. Line of the row is perpendicular, and regardless of the magnitude of the field can rotate the magnetization by only 90°. With the simultaneous passage of pulses along the row and column lines, of the total magnetic field at the location of the GMR structure will be directed at an acute angle with respect to one point and an obtuse to others. If the value of the field exceeds some critical value, the latter changes its direction.

There are several storage and reading methods for the described cell. In one method, the information is stored in the sensing layer; it is read via resistance measurement and is erased upon reading. In another scheme, the information is kept in the fixed layer, which requires higher recording currents compared to reading currents.

Tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is an extension of spin-valve GMR, in which the electrons travel with their spins oriented perpendicularly to the layers across a thin insulating tunnel barrier (replacing the non-ferromagnetic spacer). This allows to achieve a larger impedance, a larger magnetoresistance value (~10× at room temperature) and a negligible temperature dependence. TMR has now replaced GMR in MRAMs and disk drives, in particular for high area densities and perpendicular recording.

===Other applications===
Magnetoresistive insulators for contactless signal transmission between two electrically isolated parts of electrical circuits were first demonstrated in 1997 as an alternative to opto-isolators. A Wheatstone bridge of four identical GMR devices is insensitive to a uniform magnetic field and reacts only when the field directions are antiparallel in the neighboring arms of the bridge. Such devices were reported in 2003 and may be used as rectifiers with a linear frequency response.

<doc id="1002135" wikidata="Q669305" url="?curid=1002135" title="Cotia">
<text>Cotia is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. The population is 274.413 (2022 est.) in an area of 323.99 km2. The city is at an elevation of 853 m. Cotia is linked with the Rodovia Raposo Tavares highway.

The municipality is made up of the headquarters and the district of Caucaia do Alto, with its former districts of Jandira, Itapevi and Vargem Grande Paulista (originally called Raposo Tavares) having been split off to form new municipalities.

== History ==
Cotia was founded in 1580, and was an active village during the &quot;bandeiras&quot; expeditions. In 1626, Raposo Tavares and his companions arrived in the city. The &quot;Sítio do Mandú&quot; and &quot;Sítio do Padre Inácio&quot; (Mandu&#x27;s Ranch and Priest Inácio&#x27;s Ranch) were some of the first rural houses to be built there. Nowadays, they are preserved by the &quot;Instituto Brasileiro de Patrimônio Cultural. Cotia was declared an independent municipality on April 2, 1856. According to the 1980 demographic census, the city had a population of over 62 thousand people.

== Economy ==
The city&#x27;s economy is quite diverse, with the industrial and agricultural sectors standing out.

In the industrial sector located along the Raposo Tavares Highway and its surroundings, the most important products are electrical materials, chemicals, ceramics, toys, textiles, explosives, food, wine, brandy and agricultural machinery.

In agriculture, the most notable are potatoes, tomatoes, corn, beans, garlic and various fruits, most of which come from Caucaia do Alto. Poultry farming is also developed in the municipality.

In 2014, the municipality had 1,200 licensed companies (micro, small, medium and service providers) and, by the first quarter of 2015, it had 6,186 individual microentrepreneurs.

== Geography ==
The city is located west of São Paulo, and has a terrain made of valleys and mountains, reaching a maximum elevation of 1,074 meters above sea level 

The city has the Cotia River as its main river.

The city has a densely populated urban area, but the less developed areas to the west attract people interested in ecotourism. The only naturally occurring case of Brazilian hemorrhagic fever took place here.

==Demography==
=== Population history ===

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Jean Elliot (April 1727 – 29 March 1805), also known as Jane Elliot, was a Scottish poet. She wrote one of the most famous versions of &quot;The Flowers of the Forest&quot;, a song lamenting the Scottish army&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of Flodden. Published in 1776, it is her only surviving work. The lyrics are set to an earlier tune c. 1615–1625 in the John Skene of Halyards Manuscript as &quot;Flowres of the Forrest.&quot;

== Biography ==
Daughter of Sir Gilbert Elliot, Jean was born in 1727 at Minto House in Teviotdale.

During the Jacobite rising of 1745, when a posse of Jacobite Army soldiers came to arrest her influential father, Jean received and entertained the officers at Minto House with such calmness, courtesy and composure that she was able to convince them that her father was not within reach when he was actually hiding himself among Minto crags, not far from the Minto House.

While Miss Elliot had many admirers, she never married. From 1782 to 1804 she resided in Brown&#x27;s Square, Edinburgh. She is said to have been the last lady in the city who kept standing in her hall a private sedan chair.

Towards the end of her life, Jean went back to Teviotdale. She died either at Minto House, or Mount Teviot, the residence of her younger brother Admiral John Elliot, on 29 March 1805.

Her brothers included Gilbert, John, and Andrew Elliot.

<doc id="1002139" wikidata="Q5710454" url="?curid=1002139" title="Whitwell Elwin">
<text>Whitwell Elwin (26 February 1816 – 1 January 1900) was an English clergyman, critic and editor of the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;.
==Life==

He was the son of Marsham Elwin, a country gentleman of Thurning, Norfolk, Whitwell Elwin studied at Caius College, Cambridge, and took holy orders in 1840. He was Rector of Booton, Norfolk from 1849 until his death. There he rebuilt St Michael the Archangel&#x27;s Church to his own design.

==Works==
Elwin was an important contributor to the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, of which he was editor from 1853 until 1860.

He undertook to complete John Wilson Croker&#x27;s edition of Alexander Pope, and brought out five volumes, when he dropped it, leaving it to be finished by William John Courthope. As an editor he was extremely autocratic, and on all subjects had pronounced opinions, and often singular likes and dislikes.

The &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; was published by John Murray, who on 1 April 1859 agreed to publish Charles Darwin&#x27;s book &quot;An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection&quot;, without even seeing the manuscript. When the first three chapters were sent to Murray, he cautiously asked Elwin to review them. Elwin was initially opposed to publication of this book on evolution, but after consulting Darwin&#x27;s colleague Charles Lyell, Elwin felt that for Darwin &quot;to put forth the theory without the evidence would do grievous injustice to his views, &amp; to his twenty years of observation &amp; experiment. At every page I was tantalised by the absence of the proofs. All kinds of objections, &amp; possibilities rose up in the mind, &amp; it was fretting to think that the author had a whole array of facts, &amp; inferences from the facts, absolutely essential to the decision of the question which were not before the reader.&quot; He recommended Lyell&#x27;s suggestion that, to gain public agreement, rather than &quot;put forth the theory without the evidence&quot;, the book should focus on observations upon pigeons, briefly stating how these illustrated Darwin&#x27;s general principles and preparing the way for Darwin&#x27;s larger work &quot;Natural Selection&quot; which was expected to follow soon: &quot;Every body is interested in pigeons.&quot; Darwin responded that this was impractical, and his book retitled as &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; was published on Thursday 24 November 1859.

<doc id="1002152" wikidata="Q3378469" url="?curid=1002152" title="Jennifer Syme">
<text>Jennifer Maria Syme (December 7, 1972 – April 2, 2001) was an American actress, personal assistant, and record company executive. 

Jennifer was in a relationship with actor Keanu Reeves from 1998 until early 2000. Following the stillbirth of their daughter the previous December, Syme died in an automobile collision at the age of 28 on April 2, 2001, shortly after she and Reeves had reunited.

== Early life and career ==
Syme was born in Pico Rivera, California, and was raised in Laguna Beach. Her parents were Maria St. John and Charles Syme, a retired California highway patrol officer, and they divorced some time after Syme was born.

When Syme was about to start high school, she and her mother moved to Los Angeles, where Syme developed a passion for moviemaking and especially for David Lynch&#x27;s films. Actor and filmmaker Scott Coffey said that Syme was 16 years old when she walked into Lynch&#x27;s office. &quot;She was a huge fan and wanted to do anything on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;&quot;, Coffey said. Syme landed a job at Lynch&#x27;s company, Asymmetrical Productions, where she started as an intern and ended up working for five years. She introduced Lynch to many of the musicians he used in his projects, and according to Coffey, she had a huge influence on the music in the 1997 film &quot;Lost Highway&quot;.

Syme also did some acting, and Scott Coffey directed her in five independent short films. The last one, &quot;Ellie Parker&quot;, was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2001. Syme later joined the staff of a music label. She was also a personal assistant to guitarist Dave Navarro of Jane&#x27;s Addiction and, later, the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

In 1997, Syme made her film debut in a small role credited as &quot;junkie girl&quot; in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot;.

Syme had a small role credited as &quot;casting chick&quot; in Scott Coffey&#x27;s film &quot;Ellie Parker&quot;, released in 2005, reprising the role she played in the 2001 short film of the same title.

At the time of her death in 2001, Syme had enrolled in a film-supervision course at UCLA, and was working as a record company executive.

==Personal life==
According to reports, Syme met actor Keanu Reeves in 1998 at a party thrown for Reeves&#x27;s rock band, Dogstar, and they started dating. However, Syme&#x27;s mother, Maria St. John, disputed the reports and said the two had known each other for a decade, and that she was with Syme when she met Reeves, and it was not at a party.

On December 24, 1999, while eight months pregnant, she gave birth to her child with Reeves, who was stillborn. Syme&#x27;s and Reeves&#x27;s grief over the loss put a strain on their relationship, which ended several weeks later. They remained close friends after their breakup and were back together in 2001.

St. John said that Syme became very depressed when her grandfather, Alfonso Diaz, died in March 2001. Her mother noted that it was the first time she had been back to the hospital since her baby died.

Marilyn Manson mentioned Syme and how she helped him work with director David Lynch in his 1998 memoir &quot;The Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot;, and later depicted her in a painting called &quot;A Mother Without a Daughter and a Daughter Without a Mother (In Memory of Jen)&quot;.

== Death ==
On the night of April 1, 2001, Syme attended a party at the home of musician Marilyn Manson. After being driven home by another party guest shortly before dawn the following morning, she left her home, reportedly to return to the party. She drove her Jeep Grand Cherokee into a row of parked cars on Cahuenga Boulevard in Los Angeles. She was partially ejected from the vehicle and died instantly. She was 28 years old. Reeves, Dave Navarro, Scott Coffey, Anthrax&#x27;s guitarist Scott Ian, and David Lynch acted as pallbearers at Syme&#x27;s funeral. Syme was eulogized to the sound of Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;Higher Ground&quot; and Bette Midler&#x27;s &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; as Lynch screened a series of snapshots from Syme&#x27;s life at the Good Shepherd Church in Beverly Hills. She was buried next to her daughter at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. David Lynch dedicated his 2001 film &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; to Syme in the closing credits.

An investigation into the collision found that Syme was not wearing a seatbelt. Police found two rolled-up dollar bills that contained a white, powdery substance, and two bottles of prescription drugs: a muscle relaxant and an anticonvulsant. Syme&#x27;s mother told police her daughter had recently sought treatment for back pain from an earlier automobile collision, and for depression stemming from her daughter&#x27;s stillbirth.

While Syme and Keanu Reeves had broken up shortly after the stillbirth of their daughter, Reeves told investigators that they were back together. On April 1, 2001, they had brunch together at &quot;Crepes on Cole&quot; in San Francisco. The next day, Reeves called the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s Office and asked, according to Lt. Mac Willie, &quot;if Jen Syme was there.&quot;

In April 2002, Syme&#x27;s mother, Maria St. John, sued Marilyn Manson for wrongful death, for giving Syme &quot;various quantities of an illegal controlled substance&quot; and for &quot;instructing [Syme] to operate a motor vehicle in her incapacitated condition&quot;. Manson denied responsibility, stating that the lawsuit was &quot;completely without merit&quot;. The case was dismissed at St. John&#x27;s request in May 2003.

<text>&quot;The Screwfly Solution&quot; is a 1977 science fiction novella by James Tiptree Jr., a pen name for American psychologist Alice Sheldon. The story is about a misogynistic cult. 

When the story was first published in June 1977, the identity of Alice Sheldon as both Tiptree and &quot;Raccoona&quot; Sheldon was unknown to the public or anyone in the science fiction community; a series of events triggered by the death of Sheldon&#x27;s mother Mary Hastings Bradley in October 1977 resulted in the identity behind the pen-names being revealed by the end of the same year. 

&quot;The Screwfly Solution&quot; received the Nebula Award for Best Novelette in 1978, and has been adapted into a television film.

The title refers to the sterile insect technique, a technique of eradicating the population of screwflies by the release of large amounts of sterilized males that would compete with fertile males, thus reducing the native population more with each generation this is done. This story concerns a similar distortion of human sexuality with disastrous results.

==Plot summary== 
The story begins with an exchange of letters and news clippings between Alan, a scientist working on parasite eradication by releasing sterile insects in Colombia, and his wife, Anne Alstein, at home in the U.S., concerning an epidemic of organized murder of women by men.

The murderers feel that their killings are driven by natural instincts and have constructed elaborate, misogynistic rationalizations for their acts. For example, a new religious movement, the Sons of Adam, is spreading along with the murders. The Sons of Adam believe that women are evil, that the Garden of Eden was a paradise before women were created, that God is telling them to get rid of all of the women, and that once women are eliminated, God will either make everyone live forever or reveal a better way to reproduce (the movement is unclear about what exactly would happen). When the religion initially arises, prior to the organized murders, little is done to stop the ideology&#x27;s spread, nor is the movement&#x27;s actions of evicting women from the areas the men control prevented.

Initially, some women fought back, such as three women who stole an Air Force plane and bombed Dallas, but there was no organized resistance. There was extensive censoring of the news, as the government believed that it was a case of mass psychological hysteria that could be snuffed out by suppressing the news. However, a minority of scientists have figured out the truth: Some kind of infectious agent is spreading in the atmosphere, turning human male sexual impulses into violent ones.

Alan, a sensitive, kindly man, realizes that he is succumbing to the infection and tries to resist the impulses and isolate himself from women. While he does this, his wife and teenage daughter argue: the daughter, faithful to her father, refuses to believe her mother&#x27;s warnings about him. She sneaks off to visit her father, and he murders her, then kills himself in horror over his actions.

Anne flees north, to Canada, since the disease had begun in the tropical zones and was spreading toward temperate zones. In the end, Anne, pursued by an entire society bent on femicide, discovers the source and motivation behind the plague: an alien species is intentionally causing the human race to destroy itself so that the aliens can have Earth for themselves.

<text>Juliana Horatia Ewing (née Gatty, 3 August 1841 – 13 May 1885) was an English writer of children&#x27;s stories. Her writings display a sympathetic insight into children&#x27;s lives, an admiration for things military, and a strong religious faith.

==Life==
Known as Julie, she was the second of ten children of the Rev. Alfred Gatty, Vicar of Ecclesfield in Yorkshire, and Margaret Gatty, who was herself a children&#x27;s author. Their children were educated mainly by their mother, but Julie was often the driving force behind their various activities: drama, botany and so on. Later she was responsible for setting up a village library in Ecclesfield, and helped out in the parish with her three sisters. Early stories of hers appeared in Charlotte Mary Yonge&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Monthly Packet&quot;.

On 1 June 1867, Julie married Major Alexander Ewing (1830–1895) of the Army Pay Corps. A musician, composer and translator, he was also a keen churchgoer and shared his wife&#x27;s interest in literature. Within a week of their marriage, the Ewings left England for Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, where he had received a new posting. They remained there for two years, before returning to England in 1869 and spending eight years in the army town of Aldershot. Although her husband was sent overseas again, to Malta in 1879 and Sri Lanka in 1881, Ewing&#x27;s poor health precluded her from accompanying him.

On her husband&#x27;s return in 1883, the Ewings moved to Trull, Somerset, and then in 1885 to Bath, in the hopes that the change of air would do her good. However, her health continued to decline. After two operations, she died in Bath on 13 May 1885. She was given a military funeral at Trull three days later.

Julie&#x27;s sister Horatia Katharine Frances Gatty (1846–1945) published a memorial of her life and works, which includes a publication history of her stories. A later selection includes some of Julie&#x27;s letters and drawings about Canada. A biography of her by Gillian Avery appeared in 1961.

==&quot;Child-novels&quot;==

Roger Lancelyn Green calls Ewing&#x27;s works the &quot;first outstanding child-novels&quot; in English literature. They show notably sympathetic insight into child life, admiration for things military, and a reflection of Ewing&#x27;s strong Anglican faith. They include &quot;Mrs. Overtheway&#x27;s Remembrances&quot; (1869), &quot;A Flat Iron for a Farthing&quot; (1873), &quot;Six to Sixteen&quot; (1875), &quot;Jackanapes&quot; (1884), &quot;Daddy Darwin&#x27;s Dovecot&quot; (1884), and &quot;The Story of a Short Life&quot; (1885).

A talented artist herself, Ewing&#x27;s works were frequently illustrated by such notable figures as George Cruikshank and Randolph Caldecott. She was also the editor of a number of magazines which published short stories for children, such as the &quot;Nursery Magazine&quot; from 1856 onwards, the &quot;Monthly Packet&quot;, and the monthly &quot;Aunt Judy&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from 1866.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Story of a Short Life&quot; inspired Grace Kimmins to start the Guild of the Brave Poor Things to help children with disabilities in London. Grace and later Ada Vachell took their motto &quot;Laetus sorte mea&quot; (Happy in my lot) from Ewing&#x27;s book. Her &quot;Madam Liberality&quot; (1873) has been taken to be autobiographical.

Rudyard Kipling declared he knew Ewing&#x27;s novel &quot;Jan of the Windmill&quot; (1872–1873, 1876) almost by heart. He wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Something of Myself&quot;: &quot;One [book] I have still, a bound copy of &quot;Aunt Judy&#x27;s Magazine&quot; of the early &#x27;seventies, in which appeared Mrs. Ewing&#x27;s &quot;Six to Sixteen&quot;. I owe more in circuitous ways to that tale than I can tell. I knew it, as I know it still, almost by heart. Here was a history of real people and real things.&quot; Her story &quot;The Brownies&quot; (1865) gave the Baden-Powells the idea and the name for the junior level of the Girl Guides. Another admirer of her work was E. Nesbit, herself a prominent children&#x27;s author.

In 1899 a stained-glass window by Charles Eamer Kempe in memory of Alexander and Juliana Horatia Ewing was installed in the Church of All Saints, Trull, overlooking their graves.
