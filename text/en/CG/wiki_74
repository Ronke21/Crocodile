<text>Omkar Prasad Nayyar (16 January 1926 – 28 January 2007) was an Indian film music composer, singer-songwriter, music producer, and musician. He is considered to be one of the most rhythmic and melodious music directors of the Hindi film industry. He won the 1958 Filmfare Award for Best Music Director for &quot;Naya Daur&quot;. Nayyar worked extensively with singers Geeta Dutt, Asha Bhosle, Mohammed Rafi, though not with leading Bollywood female singer Lata Mangeshkar.

O. P. Nayyar had recognised Kishore Kumar long before he became a popular singer. The film like &quot;Baap Re Baap&quot; (1955) is one of Kishore Kumar hits in the characteristic &quot;O. P.&quot; style as well as the film &quot;Raagini&quot; (1958), but the relationship did not endure.

==Early life and career==
Nayyar was born in Lahore, British India (present Pakistan). He never received any formal music training.
He composed the background score for &quot;Kaneez&quot; (1949), and 1952&#x27;s &quot;Aasmaan&quot; (produced by Dalsukh M. Pancholi), was his first film as music director. Nayyar then composed music for &quot;Chham Chhama Chham&quot; (1952) and &quot;Baaz&quot; (1953). Film producer, director and actor Guru Dutt enlisted him to compose and conduct music for &quot;Aar Paar&quot; (1954), &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. &#x27;55&quot; (1955) and &quot;C.I.D.&quot; (1956). Nayyar&#x27;s early work was primarily performed by Shamshad Begum, Geeta Dutt and Mohammed Rafi, with Asha Bhosle introduced in &quot;C.I.D.&quot; Nayyar never worked with Lata Mangeshkar, though her song &quot;Saari Saari Raat Teri Yaad Satayein&quot; from the 1958 film &quot;Aji Bas Shukriya&quot;was used in the 1973 Hindi film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, for which he was the music director.

Nayyar&#x27;s favorite Raga is Pilu in Hindustani classical music, its equivalent in Carnatic music being Kapi (raga) which eventually remained source for majority of his compositions, but he has been able to mesmerize everyone with no clues.

In 1957 Filmalaya introduced Nasir Hussain, who wanted a composer to provide romantic scores for newcomers Shammi Kapoor and Ameeta. Nayyar&#x27;s scores were featured in the Hussain films &quot;Tumsa Nahin Dekha&quot; (1957) and &quot;Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon&quot; (1964). During the decade, state-controlled All India Radio banned most of Nayyar&#x27;s songs because the broadcaster considered them too &quot;trendy&quot;.

According to music and film expert Rajesh Subramanian, &quot;Aap Ke Haseen Rukh&quot; (from &quot;Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi&quot;) was planned with full orchestration but many of the musicians were late for the recording. After a disagreement with Mohammed Rafi, Nayyar began working with singer Mahendra Kapoor. Kapoor performed Nayyar&#x27;s song &quot;Badal Jaaye Agar Maali, Chaman Hotaa Nahi Khaali&quot; in &quot;Bahaaren Phir Bhi Aayengi&quot;. Based on a Bengali language song Ekla Chalo Re by Rabindranath Tagore, Nayyar composed &quot;Chal Akelaa, Chal Akelaa&quot; (sung by Mukesh in 1969 film &quot;Sambandh&quot;).

Nayyar co-produced songs with Shamshad Begum (including &quot;Kajra Mohabbatwala&quot;), and after Madhubala&#x27;s 1969 death Vyjayanthimala, Sadhana, Mala Sinha, Padmini, Asha Parekh and Sharmila Tagore lip-synced several Nayyar-Bhosle songs. Nayyar and Bhosle parted ways in 1974, and he then worked with Dilraj Kaur, Krishna Kalle, Vani Jayaram and Kavita Krishanmurthy. Majrooh Sultanpuri and Sahir Ludhianvi wrote the lyrics for some of Nayyar&#x27;s earlier songs, including &quot;Naya Daur&quot;. Nayyar also worked with developing lyricists such as Jan Nisar Akhtar, Qamar Jalalabadi, S. H. Bihari and Ahmed Wasi. He began the tradition of assigning full, three-minute songs to comedians. Om Prakash sang Nayyar&#x27;s &quot;Churi Bane Kanta Bane&quot; in &quot;Jaali Note&quot; and &quot;Eent ki dukhi paan ka ikka&quot; in &quot;Howrah Bridge&quot; and Johnny Walker sang &quot;Aye Dil Hai Mushkil Jeena Yahaan&quot; in &quot;CID&quot;, &quot;Jaane Kahan Mera Jigar Gaya Jee&quot; in &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. 55&quot;, &quot;Main Bambaika Baaboo, Naam Meraa Anjaanaa&quot; in &quot;Naya Daur&quot; and &quot;Bajewala&quot; in &quot;Basant&quot;.

In addition to songs for Asha Bhosle and Geeta Dutt&#x27;s, &quot;Thandi Thandi Hawaa&quot;, Nayyar wrote &quot;Yeh Desh Hai Veer Jawaanonkaa&quot; (featuring Dilip Kumar and Ajit) for &quot;Naya Daur&quot; (1957). The song earned him the 1958 Filmfare Best Music Director Award. The last Nayyar song performed by Bhosle was &quot;Chain Se Humko Kabhi&quot;. Intended for &quot;Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye&quot; (1973), disappeared in the film&#x27;s final cut but won Bhosle the 1975 Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer. Nayyar was less active in the 1970s and did not compose music for younger actors such as Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan. His films included Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Guru Dutt, Dharmendra, Shammi Kapoor, Joy Mukherjee, Biswajit, Feroz Khan, Bharat Bhushan, Madhubala, Asha Parekh, Sadhana, Mumtaz, Sharmila Tagore, Rajshree, Rekha, Ameeta and Shyama. In addition to Hindi films, Nayyar composed for &quot;Neerajanam&quot; 1989 film in Telugu. He made a brief comeback during the 1990s with &quot;Mangni&quot; and &quot;Nishchay&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Zid&quot; in 1994.
O.P. Nayyar played a major part in shaping up Asha&#x27;s career, but Asha rarely mentions it. She mentions S. D. Burman&#x27;s name instead. Why OP and Asha parted away in 1974, neither of them ever talked about it.

==Personal life==
He had three brothers: Elder brother colonel G. P. Nayyar (a retired army dentist in Secunderabad who died in 2010), then Dr. H.P. Nayyar (a physician, who died in 2005) the younger one is P. P. Nayyar (a physician, who was kidnapped in Australia since then he is missing). O. P. Nayyar&#x27;s wife, Saroj Nayyar was a stage dancer before marriage and she came in touch with O. P. Nayyar at Lahore Radio Station at that time he was a singer at that station, Saroj Nayyar wrote the lyrics to &quot;Preetam Aan Milo&quot; (originally sung by C. H. Atma in 1945 which was used later in the film &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. &#x27;55&quot; by Geeta Dutt). They had daughters Sonia, Annapoorna, Laxmi and son Ashish. Niharica Raizada an actress from Luxembourg, is his brother&#x27;s granddaughter.

He is reported to have had an affair with Asha Bhosle. They broke up in 1972. His last song sung by Asha Bhosle was &quot;Chain se hum ko kabhi aap ne jeene na diyaa&quot;, for the movie Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye in 1974. The song was never included in the movie, however Asha won the Filmfare Best Singer award of 1974 for the same song. Asha did not go to the awards function, but O. P. Nayyar accepted the award for her. On his way home, he threw away the award.

Estranged from his family, Nayyar had moved out of his Churchgate Mumbai home in 1979, first staying in a hotel and then staying with Madhuri Joglekar, a singer, in Virar from 1989 and then as a paying guest in Thane with Rani Nakhwa and her family. He requested that his family be barred from his funeral. He died on 28 January 2007 following a heart attack. 

None of his family members or the Bollywood figures attended his last rites at the civic crematorium in Thane. 

He was survived by his estranged family, wife, three daughters and a son. Nayyar&#x27;s death was followed by tributes from many Bollywood figures, including Lata Mangeshkar, Sharmila Tagore, Mumtaz, Mahesh Bhatt, Khayyam, Shakti Samanta, Sonu Nigam, Ravindra Jain, Anu Malik, B. R. Chopra and Shammi Kapoor. A commemorative stamp was issued by India Post on 3 May 2013. His granddaughter Niharica Raizada is also an actress.

<text>Foundry Networks, Inc. was a networking hardware vendor selling high-end Ethernet switches and routers. The company was acquired by Brocade Communications Systems on December 18, 2008. 

==History==


The company was founded in 1996 by Bobby R. Johnson, Jr. and was headquartered in Santa Clara, California, United States. In its first year the company operated under the names Perennium Networks and StarRidge Networks, but by January 1997 the name Foundry Networks was adopted. Foundry Networks had their initial public offering in 1999, during the Internet bubble, with the company reaching a valuation of $9 billion on its first day of trading on NASDAQ with the symbol FDRY.

Foundry Networks designed, manufactured and sold high-end enterprise and service provider switches and routers, as well as wireless, security, and traffic management solutions. It was best known for its Layer 2 &amp; 3 Ethernet switches. Foundry Networks was the first company to build and ship a gigabit Ethernet switch in 1997; to build a Layer 3 switch, also in 1997; to build the first Layer 4-7 switch in 1998 and to include 10 Gigabit Ethernet single connectors in its boxes (since 2001).

Foundry Networks early product lines consisted of the Workgroup, Backbone, and ServerIron products. The TurboIron all GigE switch and then router models were later introduced. Foundry Networks&#x27; later product lines consisted of the BigIron, EdgeIron, FastIron, IronPoint, NetIron, SecureIron, and ServerIron. After the early BigIron modular chassis, the Mucho Grande (MG) series chassis were introduced. Later the RX series in 4, 8, 16, and 32 slot versions. The largest and final product, the XMR was a full rack sized switch/router. Their software products included IronView and ServerIron TrafficWorks.

According to a Dell’Oro report published in 1Q2006, Foundry Networks ranked number 4 in a total market share of over US$3,659 million, and its ServerIron application switch ranked first for total port shipments.

== Acquisition==
On July 21, 2008, Foundry management agreed to allow the company to be acquired by storage networking company Brocade Communications Systems for approximately $3 billion in cash and stock. On November 7, they agreed to a reduced purchase price of roughly $2.6 billion in an all-cash transaction when Brocade was unable to come up with a $400M tranche of financing required to complete the original deal. A meeting was scheduled for December 17, 2008, where shareholders approved the amended agreement.

The acquisition was completed on December 18, 2008.

Qatalyst Partners advised Brocade on financial matters, and Cooley Godward Kronish LLP was Brocade&#x27;s legal adviser. TJ Grewal, Jody Kirk, and Alex Lam were the deal leads on the Brocade team.

Brocade sold Foundry&#x27;s FastIron Campus portfolio to Arris (Ruckus Networks) and SRA portfolio to Extreme Networks in 2017.

<doc id="997055" wikidata="Q8007328" url="?curid=997055" title="William Crowe (poet)">
<text>William Crowe (1745–1829) was an English poet, the son of a carpenter and educated as a foundationer at Winchester College. He went to Oxford, where he became public orator.

Crowe was a clergyman and rector of Alton Barnes in Wiltshire. He wrote a popular, but somewhat conventional poem, &quot;Lewesdon Hill&quot; in 1789, edited William Collins&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; in 1828, and lectured on poetry at the Royal Institution. His poems were collected in 1804 and 1827.

==Life==
William Crowe was born at Midgham, Berkshire, and baptised 13 October 1745. His father, a carpenter by trade, lived during Crowe&#x27;s childhood at Winchester, where the boy occasionally sang as a chorister in Winchester College chapel. At the election in 1758, he was placed on the roll for admission as a scholar at the college, and was duly elected a &quot;poor scholar&quot;. He was fifth on the roll for New College, Oxford at the election in 1764, and succeeded to a vacancy on 11 August 1765. After two years of probation he was admitted as Fellow in 1767, and became a tutor of his college. On 10 October 1773, he took the degree of B.C.L.

Crowe continued to hold his fellowship until November 1783, although, according to Thomas Moore, he had several years previously married &quot;a fruitwoman&#x27;s daughter at Oxford&quot; and had become the father of several children. In 1782, on the presentation of his college, he was admitted to the rectory of Stoke Abbott in Dorset, which he exchanged for Alton Barnes in Wiltshire in 1787, and on 2 April 1784 he was elected the public orator of Oxford University. Crowe retained this position and the rectory of Alton Barnes until his death in 1829, and he discharged his duties as orator until he was advanced in years.

According to the &quot;Clerical Guide&quot;, Crowe was also rector until his death at Llanymynech in Denbighshire, from 1805, and incumbent of Saxton in Yorkshire, valued at about £80 a year, from the same date. A portrait of Crowe is preserved in New College library. A grace for the degree of D.C.L. was passed by his college on 30 March 1780, but he does not seem to have proceeded to take it.

Crowe and Samuel Rogers were close friends. After a short illness, he died at Queen Square, Bath on 9 February 1829, aged 83.

==Reputation==
Anecdotes were told of his eccentric speech and his rustic manners. In politics he was an extreme Whig, close to being a republican, and he sympathised with the early stages of the French Revolution. He was accustomed to walk from his living in Wiltshire to his college at Oxford. His appearances in the pulpit or in the Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford were always welcomed by the graduates of the university; his Latin sermons at St. Mary&#x27;s or his orations at commemoration, graced as they were by a fine rich voice, enjoyed great popularity.

Crowe was interested in architecture, and occasionally read a course of lectures on that subject in New College hall. The merits of his lectures at the Royal Institution on poetry were praised by Thomas Frognall Dibdin. When he visited Horne Tooke at Wimbledon, a considerable portion of his time was spent in the garden. He was skilled in valuing timber, from associating with farmers. His portrait as &quot;a celebrated public orator&quot; was drawn by Robert Dighton January 1808 in full-length academicals and with a college cap in his hand.

==Works==
&quot;Lewesdon Hill&quot; is Crowe&#x27;s poem on the hill in the western part of Dorset, on the edge of the parish of Broadwindsor, of which Tom Fuller was rector, and near Crowe&#x27;s benefice of Stoke Abbott. The poet is depicted as climbing the hill-top on a May morning and describing the prospect, with its associations, which his eye surveys. The first edition, issued anonymously and dedicated to Jonathan Shipley, was published at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, in 1788. A second impression, with its authorship avowed, was demanded in the same year, and later editions, in a much enlarged form, and with several other poems, were published in 1804 and 1827.

Crowe&#x27;s other works were:
* ‘A Sermon before the University of Oxford at St. Mary&#x27;s, 5 Nov. 1781.’
* ‘On the late Attempt on her Majesty&#x27;s Person, a sermon before the University of Oxford at St. Mary&#x27;s, 1786.’
* ‘Oratio ex Instituto ... Dom. Crew.’ 1788. From the preface it appears that the oration was printed in refutation of certain slanders as to its character which had been circulated. It contained his views on the Glorious Revolution of 1688.
* ‘Oratio Crewiana,’ 1800. On poetry and the poetry professorship at Oxford.
* ‘Hamlet and As you like it, a specimen of a new edition of Shakespeare’; anonymous by Thomas Caldecott and Crowe, 1819, with later editions in 1820 and 1832. The two authors contemplated a new edition of Shakespeare. Caldecott was Crowe&#x27;s schoolfellow at Winchester and lifelong friend.
* ‘A Treatise on English Versification,’ 1827, dedicated to Caldecott.
* ‘Poems of William Collins, with notes, and Dr. Johnson&#x27;s Life, corrected and enlarged,’ Bath, 1828.

Crowe&#x27;s son died in battle in 1815, and in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; there is a Latin monody by his father on his loss. His verses intended to have been spoken at the theatre at Oxford on the installation of the Duke of Portland as chancellor were praised by Rogers and Moore. His sonnet to Petrarch is included in the collections of English sonnets by Robert Fletcher Housman and Alexander Dyce. 

Crowe contributed articles to &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot;, but the topics are not known.

<doc id="997056" wikidata="Q707614" url="?curid=997056" title="Manuel Cardoso (composer)">
<text>Manuel Cardoso (baptized 11 December 1566 – 24 November 1650) was a Portuguese composer and organist. With Duarte Lobo and John IV of Portugal, he represented the &quot;golden age&quot; of Portuguese polyphony.

Cardoso is not known to be related to an older contemporary composer of the same name; the precentor Manuel Cardoso, who published a book of Latin passions in Leiria in 1575.

Cardoso was born in Fronteira, near Portalegre, most likely in 1566. He attended the Colégio dos Moços do Coro, a choir school associated with the Évora cathedral, studying with Manuel Mendes and Cosme Delgado. In 1588 he joined the Carmelite order, taking his vows in 1589. In the early 1620s he was resident at the ducal household of Vila Viçosa, where he was befriended by the Duke of Barcelos—later to become King John IV. For most of his career he was the resident composer and organist at the Carmelite Convento do Carmo in Lisbon.

Cardoso&#x27;s works are models of Palestrinian polyphony, and are written in a refined, precise style which completely ignores the development of the Baroque idiom elsewhere in Europe. His style has much in common with Tomás Luis de Victoria, in its careful treatment of dissonance, occasional polychoral writing, and frequent cross-relations, which were curiously common among both Iberian and English composers of the time. Three books of masses survive; many of the works are based on motets written by King John IV himself, and others are based on motets by Palestrina. Cardoso was widely published, often with the help of King John IV to defray costs. Many of his works—especially the elaborate polychoral compositions, which probably were the most progressive—were destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake and fire of 1755.

<text>Maria Susanna Cummins (April 9, 1827 – October 1, 1866) was an American novelist. She authored the novel &quot;The Lamplighter&quot; (1854).

==Biography==
Maria Susanna Cummins was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on April 9, 1827. She was the daughter of David Cummins and Maria F. Kittredge, and was the eldest of four children. The Cummins family resided in the neighborhood of Dorchester in Boston, Massachusetts. Cummins&#x27; father encouraged her to become a writer at an early age. She studied at Mrs. Charles Sedgwick&#x27;s Young Ladies School in Lenox, Massachusetts.

In 1854, she published the novel &quot;The Lamplighter&quot;. One reviewer called it &quot;one of the most original and natural narratives&quot;. Within eight weeks, it sold 40,000 copies and totaled 70,000 by the end of its first year in print. She wrote other books, including &quot;Mabel Vaughan&quot; (1857).

Cummins died in Dorchester after a period of illness on October 1, 1866, aged 39.

<doc id="997062" wikidata="Q832661" url="?curid=997062" title="Stability and Growth Pact">
<text>The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is an agreement, among all the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), to facilitate and maintain the stability of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Based primarily on Articles 121 and 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it consists of fiscal monitoring of member states by the European Commission and the Council of the European Union, and the issuing of a yearly Country-Specific Recommendation for fiscal policy actions to ensure a full compliance with the SGP also in the medium-term. If a member state breaches the SGP&#x27;s outlined maximum limit for government deficit and debt, the surveillance and request for corrective action will intensify through the declaration of an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP); and if these corrective actions continue to remain absent after multiple warnings, a member state of the eurozone can ultimately also be issued economic sanctions. The pact was outlined by a European Council resolution in June 1997, and two Council regulations in July 1997. The first regulation &quot;on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies&quot;, known as the &quot;preventive arm&quot;, entered into force 1 July 1998. The second regulation &quot;on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure&quot;, sometimes referred to as the &quot;dissuasive arm&quot; but commonly known as the &quot;corrective arm&quot;, entered into force 1 January 1999.

The purpose of the pact was to ensure that fiscal discipline would be maintained and enforced in the EMU. All EU member states are automatically members of both the EMU and the SGP, as this is defined by paragraphs in the EU Treaty itself. The fiscal discipline is ensured by the SGP by requiring each Member State, to implement a fiscal policy aiming for the country to stay within the limits on government deficit (3% of GDP) and debt (60% of GDP); and in case of having a debt level above 60% it should each year decrease with a satisfactory pace towards a level below. As outlined by the &quot;preventive arm&quot; regulation, all EU member states are each year obliged to submit a SGP compliance report for the scrutiny and evaluation of the European Commission and the Council of the European Union, that will present the country&#x27;s expected fiscal development for the current and subsequent three years. These reports are called &quot;stability programmes&quot; for eurozone Member States and &quot;convergence programmes&quot; for non-eurozone Member States, but despite having different titles they are identical in regards of the content. After the reform of the SGP in 2005, these programmes have also included the Medium-Term budgetary Objectives (MTO), being individually calculated for each Member State as the medium-term sustainable average-limit for the country&#x27;s structural deficit, and the Member State is also obliged to outline the measures it intends to implement to attain its MTO. If the EU Member State does not comply with both the deficit limit and the debt limit, a so-called &quot;Excessive Deficit Procedure&quot; (EDP) is initiated along with a deadline to comply, which basically includes and outlines an &quot;adjustment path towards reaching the MTO&quot;. This procedure is outlined by the &quot;dissuasive arm&quot; regulation.

The SGP was initially proposed by German finance minister Theo Waigel in the mid-1990s. Germany had long maintained a low-inflation policy, which had been an important part of the German economy&#x27;s robust performance since the 1950s. The German government hoped to ensure the continuation of that policy through the SGP, which would ensure the prevalence of fiscal responsibility, and limit the ability of governments to exert inflationary pressures on the European economy. As such, it was also described to be a key tool for the member states adopting the euro, to ensure that they did not only meet the Maastricht convergence criteria at the time of adopting the euro but kept on complying with the fiscal criteria for the following years. The Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), also known as the corrective arm of the SGP, was suspended via activation of the &quot;general escape clause&quot; during 2020–2023 to allow for higher deficit spending; first due to the COVID-19 pandemic arriving as an extraordinary circumstance, and later during 2022-2023 due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine having sent energy prices up, defence spending up and budgetary pressures up across the EU. Despite the EDP suspension in 2020-2023, Romania still experienced the opening of an EDP in April 2020; but only because of existence of a deficit limit breach being recorded already for its 2019 fiscal year, which required corrective action across 2020–2024, to remedy a budgetary imbalance created before 2020. 16 out of 27 member states had a technical SGP criteria breach, when their 2022 fiscal results and 2023 budgets were analyzed in May 2023; because those breaches were exempted due to the finding of temporary and exceptional circumstances, reflected by the activation of the general escape clause, no new EDPs were opened against those member states.

The EDP will be assessed again starting from 19 June 2024, where each country will have their usual set of a &quot;2024 National Reform Programme&quot; and &quot;2024 Stability or Convergence Programme&quot; analyzed, with a compliance check of the 2023 fiscal result and 2024 budget with the existing 2019-version of the SGP rules, although only 3% deficit breaches will be evaluated because no debt limit or debt reduction breach can trigger an EDP in 2024. The European Commission reasoned for its continued deactivation for another year of the debt limit or debt reduction rule in 2023–2024, stating &quot;that compliance with the debt reduction benchmark could imply a too demanding frontloaded fiscal effort that would risk to jeopardise economic growth. Therefore, in the view of the Commission, compliance with the debt reduction benchmark is not warranted under the prevailing economic conditions.&quot; In February 2024, the EU approved a revised set of SGP rules, that will introduce acceptance of a slower adjustment path towards respecting the deficit and debt limit of the SGP, and extend the maximum duration of an Excessive Deficit Procedure from four to seven years if certain reform requirements are respected. The new revised rules will be finally adopted by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers before the 2024 European Parliament election; and fully applied starting from the presented drafts for 2025 budgets. The first &quot;national medium-term fiscal-structural plans&quot; guided by the new revised fiscal rules, will cover the four-year period 2025–2028, and need to be submitted by each member state by 20 September 2024.

== Timeline ==
This is a timeline of how the Stability and Growth Pact evolved over time:

* 1997: The Stability and Growth Pact is decided.
* 1998: The preventative arm comes into force.
* 1999: The corrective arm comes into force.
* 2005: The SGP is amended. 
* 2011: The Six Pack enters into force.
* 2013: The Fiscal Compact and the Two-Pack are adopted.
* 2020: The General Escape Clause within the existing regulations is activated, and the SGP fiscal rules suspended for fiscal years 2020–22.
* 2023: The General Escape Clause within the existing regulations is deactivated, and the SGP fiscal rules will apply again starting from the next evaluation in June 2024, concerning data for fiscal year 2023 and budget year 2024.
* 2024: Reform of the Economic Governance Framework (new fiscal rules) will be adopted by EU in spring 2024, and apply starting from submission of 2025 budgets and 2025–2028 national fiscal plans in September 2024.

==Reform 2005==
In March 2005, the EU Council, under the pressure of France and Germany, relaxed the rules; the EC said it was to respond to criticisms of insufficient flexibility and to make the pact more enforceable. The Ecofin agreed on a reform of the SGP. The ceilings of 3% for budget deficit and 60% for public debt were maintained, but the decision to declare a country in excessive deficit can now rely on certain parameters: the behaviour of the cyclically adjusted budget, the level of debt, the duration of the slow growth period and the possibility that the deficit is related to productivity-enhancing procedures. The pact is part of a set of Council Regulations, decided upon the European Council Summit 22–23 March 2005.

; Reform changes of the preventive arm
* Country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objectives (MTO): Previously throughout 1999-2004 the SGP had outlined a common MTO for all Member States, which was &quot;to achieve a budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus over a complete business cycle&quot;. After the reform, MTOs were calculated to country-specific values according to &quot;the economic and budgetary position and sustainability risks of the Member State&quot;, based upon the state&#x27;s current debt-to-GDP ratio and long-term potential GDP growth, while the overall objective over the medium term is still &quot;to achieve a budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus over a complete business cycle&quot;. No exact formula for the calculation of the country specific MTO was presented in 2005, but it was emphasized the upper limit for the MTO should be at a level &quot;providing a safety margin towards continuously respecting the government&#x27;s 3% deficit limit, while ensuring fiscal sustainability in the long run&quot;. In addition it was enforced by the EU regulation, that the upper MTO limit for eurozone states or ERM II Member States should be: &quot;Max. 1.0% of GDP in structural deficit if the state had a combination of low debt and high potential growth, and if the opposite was the case – or if the state suffered from increased age-related sustainability risks in the long term, then the upper MTO limit should move up to be in &quot;balance or in surplus&quot;.&quot; Finally, it was emphasized, that each Member State has the task to select its MTO when submitting its yearly convergence/stability programme report, and always allowed to select its MTO at a more ambitious level compared to the upper MTO limit, if this better suited its medium-term fiscal policy.
* Minimum annual budgetary effort – for states on the adjustment path to reach its MTO: All Member States agreed that fiscal consolidation of the budget should be pursued &quot;when the economic conditions are favourable&quot;, which was defined as being periods where the actual GDP growth exceeded the average for long-term potential growth. In regards of windfall revenues, a rule was also agreed, that such funds should be spent directly on reduction of government deficit and debt. In addition, a special adjustment rule was agreed for all Eurozone states and ERM-II member states being found not yet to have reached their MTO, outlining that they commit to implement yearly improvements for its structural deficit equal to minimum 0.5% of GDP.
* Early-warning system: The existing early-warning mechanism is expanded. The European Commission can now also issue an &quot;opinion&quot; directed to member states, without a prior Council involvement, in situations where the opinion functions as formal advice and encouragement to a Member State for realizing the agreed adjustment path towards reaching its declared MTO. This means that the commission will not limit its opinion/recommendations only to situations with an acute risk of breaching the 3% of GDP reference value, but also contact Member States with a notification letter in cases where it finds unjustified deviations from the adjustment path towards the declared MTO or unexpected breaches of the MTO itself (even if the 3% deficit limit is fully respected).
* Structural reforms: To ensure that implementation of needed structural reforms will not face disincentives due to the regime of complying with the adjustment path towards reaching a declared MTO, it was agreed that implementation of major structural reforms (if they have direct long-term cost-saving effects – and can be verified to improve fiscal sustainability over the long term – i.e. pension scheme reforms), should automatically allow for a temporary deviation from the MTO or its adjustment path, equal to the costs of implementing the structural reform, in the condition that the 3% deficit limit will be respected and the MTO or MTO-adjustment path will be reached again within the four-year programme period.

==Reforms 2011–13==

The 2010 European sovereign debt crisis proved the serious shortcomings embedded in the SGP. On one hand, fiscal wisdom was not spontaneously followed by the majority of Eurozone Members during the early-2000s expansion cycle. On the other hand, the EDP was not duly carried out, when necessary, as the cases of France and Germany clearly show.

In order to stabilise the Eurozone, Member States adopted an extensive package of reforms, aiming at straightening both the substantive budgetary rules and the enforcement framework. The result was a complete revision of the SGP. The measures adopted soon proved highly controversial, because they implied an unprecedented curtailment of national sovereignty and the conferral upon the Union of penetrating surveillance competences. The new framework consists of a patchwork of normative acts, both within and outside the formal EU edifice. Consequently, the system is now much more complex.

=== Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance ===

The Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG), commonly labeled as European Fiscal Compact, was signed on 2 March 2012 by all eurozone member states and eight other EU member states and entered into force on 1 January 2013. As of today, all current 27 EU member states ratified or acceded to the treaty, while the main opponent against the TSCG (the United Kingdom) left the EU in January 2020. The TSCG was intended to promote the launch of a new intergovernmental economic cooperation, outside the formal framework of the EU treaties, because most (but not all) member states at the time of its creation were willing to be bound by extra commitments.

Despite being an intergovernmental treaty outside the EU legal framework, all treaty provisions function as an extension to pre-existing EU regulations, utilising the same reporting instruments and organisational structures already created within the EU in the three areas: Budget discipline enforced by Stability and Growth Pact (extended by ), Coordination of economic policies (extended by ), and Governance within the EMU (extended by ). The full treaty applies for all eurozone member states. A voluntary opt-in for non-eurozone member states to be bound by the fiscal and economic provisions of the treaty (Title III+IV) has been declared by Denmark, Bulgaria and Romania, while this main part of the treaty currently does not apply for Sweden, Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic - until the point of time they either declare otherways or adopt the euro. 

Member states bound by Title III of the TSCG have to transpose these fiscal provisions (referred to as the Fiscal Compact) into their national legislation. In particular, the general government budget has to be in balance or surplus, under the treaty&#x27;s definition. As a novelty, an automatic correction mechanism has to be established by written law in order to correct potential significant deviations. Establishment is also required of a national independent monitoring institution to provide fiscal surveillance (commonly referred to as a fiscal council), with a mandate to verify all statistical data and fiscal budgets of the government are in compliance with the agreed fiscal rules, and ensure the proper functioning of the automatic correction mechanism.

The treaty defines a balanced budget exactly the same way the SGP did, as a government budget deficit not exceeding 3.0% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and a structural deficit not exceeding a country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO). The Fiscal Compact however introduced a more strict upper MTO-limit compared to SGP, as it now at most can be set to 0.5% of GDP for states with a debt‑to‑GDP ratio exceeding 60%, while only states with debt levels below 60% of GDP will be subject to respect an upper MTO-limit at the SGP-allowed 1.0% of GDP. The exact applying country-specific minimum MTO is recalculated and set by the European Commission for each country every third year, and might be set at levels stricter than the greatest latitude permitted by the treaty.

In line with the existing SGP rules, the general government budget balance of a member state will be in compliance with the TSCG deficit criteria, either if its found to be within the country-specific MTO-limit, or if its found to display &quot;rapid progress&quot; on its &quot;adjustment path&quot; towards respecting the country-specific MTO-limit. On this point the TSCG is only stricter than SGP by using the phrase &quot;rapid progress&quot; (without quantifying this term), while the SGP regulation opted instead to use the phrase &quot;sufficient progress&quot;. In line with the existing SGP rules, the European Commission will for each country set the available time-frame for the &quot;adjustment path&quot; until the MTO-limit shall be achieved, based on consideration of a country-specific debt sustainability risk assessment, while also respecting the requirement that the annual improvements for the structural budget balance shall be minimum 0.5% of GDP.

The treaty refers to that the compliance check and calculation of sufficiently required corrections for the debt-limit and &quot;debt brake&quot; criteria, shall be identical with the existing operating debt rules outlined by the Stability and Growth Pact. The outlined debt-limit and debt brake criteria established four ways for a member state to comply with the debt rules, either by simply having a gross debt level below 60% of GDP, or if above 60% of GDP it then needs to be found &quot;sufficiently diminishing&quot; by specific calculation formulas, either over a &quot;3year forward looking period&quot; or a &quot;3year backward looking period&quot; or a &quot;3year backward looking period based on cyclical adjusted data&quot;.

If any of the periodic checks conducted by the national fiscal council finds the budget or estimated fiscal account of the general government to be noncompliant with the deficit or debt criteria of the treaty, the state is obliged to immediately rectify the issue by implementing sufficient counteracting fiscal measures or changes to its ongoing fiscal policy for the specific year(s) in concern. If a state is in breach at the time of the treaty&#x27;s entry into force, the correction will be deemed to be sufficient if it delivers sufficiently large annual improvements to remain on a country specific predefined &quot;adjustment path&quot; towards the limits at a midterm horizon. Similar to the general escape clause of the SGP, a state suffering a significant recession or a temporary exceptional event outside its control with major budgetary impact, will be exempted from the requirement to deliver a fiscal automatic correction for as long as it lasts.

The treaty states that the signatories shall attempt to incorporate the treaty into EU&#x27;s legal framework, on the basis of an assessment of the experience with its implementation, by 1 January 2018 at the latest. In December 2017, the European Commission proposed a new Council Directive to incorporate the main fiscal provisions of the TSCG (all articles of its Title III - except ) into EU law. The ECB proposed several clarifying amendments to this proposed Council Directive in May 2018, while noting a potential adoption of this Directive should only happen together with an amendment of the pre-existing Council Regulation 1466/97, in order to reflect the TSCG had introduced a stricter upper limit for the structural deficit (MTO) at 0.5% of GDP for member states indebted by a debt-to-GDP ratio above 60%, which was a stricter limit than the maximum 1% of GDP being allowed by Council Regulation 1466/97 for all eurozone member states regardless of their debt-to-GDP ratio. If the Council Directive is adopted, it will align the EU fiscal rules with the TSCG fiscal rules. As the content of the Directive does not cover all articles of the TSCG, it will however not replace it, but continue to coexist with TSCG. The proposed Council Directive was never adopted, but the latest 2024 reform is a new attempt to integrate the TSCG into EU law, that will likely succeed.

=== Secondary legislation ===
Several secondary legislative acts were implemented to strengthen both the preventive and the corrective arms of the SGP. One must distinguish between the 2011 Sixpack and the 2013 Twopack.

==== Sixpack ====
The Sixpack consists of five Regulations and one Directive, which all entered into force on 13 December 2011, although compliance with the Directive was only required by 31 December 2013.

* Regulation 1177/2011 amended the corrective arm (Regulation 1467/97), with a new debt reduction rule being introduced and operationalised (see subchapter below), and the Excessive Deficit Procedure being modified. On one side, each procedural step was subjected to precise and bounding timing. On the other side, the flexibility clauses listed in Art. 126(3) were better specified to reduce enforcement uncertainty.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1177/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regulation 1176/2011 introduced the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP), a new procedure based on the macroeconomic clauses of the treaties. This procedure is not concerned with budgetary rules, but with the reduction of &quot;macroeconomic imbalances&quot;. The latter consists of economic trends experienced by one member state that can upset the normal functioning of the economy. An example of such trends might be the development of a housing bubble like the one that busted in Ireland in 2010, or of an uncontrolled current account surplus or deficit.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIP regulation 1176/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regulations 1173/2011&lt;ref name=&quot;1173/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 1174/2011&lt;ref name=&quot;EIP sanction regulation 1174/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; modified the framework for the imposition of sanctions in the context of both the EDP and the MIP. A semi-automatic mechanism was introduced: the establishment of a budgetary infringement would trigger a fining decision within the Council unless a qualified majority vote expresses a contrary opinion. Furthermore, as the infringements persist, less afflictive sanctions (such as interest-bearing deposits) are automatically transformed into more afflictive ones (either non-interest-bearing deposits or fines).
* Regulation 1175/2011 amended the preventive arm (Regulation 1466/97), and introduced the European Semester.&lt;ref name=&quot;R1175/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is a procedure meant to provide a forum for ex ante coordination of economic and budgetary policies of Member States on an annual basis. In particular, every year in April all eurozone member states submit their &quot;stability programmes&quot;, while all non-eurozone member states submit &quot;convergence programmes&quot; that except of a different title provides identical content. These documents outline the main elements of the member states&#x27; budgetary plans and are assessed by the Commission for compliance with the SGP criteria both within the preventive arm (MTO achievement) and corrective arm (EDP correction). An important part of the assessment addresses compliance with the minimum annual benchmark figures set for each individual country&#x27;s structural budget balance, striving towards either a minimum improvement for the structural budget balance to be on the set path to correct an ongoing Exessive Deficit Procedure within the corrective arm, or striving towards achievement of the country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO) - or being assessed to be on an appropriate adjustment path towards this MTO within the preventive arm. Based on its assessment of the stability and convergence programmes, the Commission also draws up Country-Specific Recommendations for all EU member states, on which the Council adopts opinions in July. These include recommendations for appropriate economic and fiscal policy actions. All CSRs adopted in the context of the European Semester since 2011 are registered in the CSR database, which is the main tool for recording and monitoring each member state&#x27;s annual progress with the implementation of CSRs. Furthermore, the Council adopts recommendations on economic policies that apply to the euro area as a whole.
* Directive 2011/85/EU outlined requirements for annually submitted budgetary frameworks of all member states,&lt;ref name=&quot;Directive 2011/85/EU&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and shall be implemented by each member state no later than 31 December 2013.

===== New debt reduction rule (Regulation 1177/2011) =====
The corrective arm of the SGP (Regulation 1467/97) was amended by Regulation 1177/2011. By an entirely rewritten &quot;article 2&quot;, this amendment introduced and operationalised a new &quot;debt reduction rule&quot;, commonly referred to as the &quot;debt brake rule&quot;, and legislatively referred to as the &quot;1/20 numerical benchmark for debt reduction&quot;. The new debt reduction rule entered into force at the EU level on 13 December 2011.

* Debt brake rule: Member states whose gross debt-to-GDP ratio for the general government exceeds the 60% reference level in the latest recorded fiscal year, shall reduce it at an average rate of at least one twentieth (5%) per year of the exceeded percentage points, where the calculated average period shall be either the 3year period covering the latest fiscal year and forecasts for the current and next year, or the latest three fiscal years. Rising debt levels for both of the rolling 3year periods, are allowed for as long as the debt-to-GDP ratio of the member state does not exceed 60% in the latest recorded fiscal year. If the European Commission had decided the interim values in the 3year periods should have no direct influence on the reduction requirement at the end point of the period, then the formula would have been quite simple (i.e. for a debt-to-GDP ratio recorded to be 80% by the end of the year preceding the latest fiscal year, then it should for the period covering the latest fiscal year and the subsequent forecast two years decline with at least: 1/20 * (80%60%) = 1.0 percentage point per year, resulting in a limit of 77.0% three years later). As the European Commission decided interim values in the 3year periods also should impact the final debt reduction requirement, they came up with this slightly more complicated benchmark calculation formula:
:* Backwards-checking formula for the debt reduction bechmark (bbt):bbt = 60% + 0.95*(bt-1-60%)/3 + 0.952*(bt-2-60%)/3 + 0.953*(bt-3-60%)/3. The bb-value is the calculated benchmark limit for year &quot;t&quot;. The formula feature three t-year-indexes for backwards-checking.
:* Forwards-checking formula for the debt reduction bechmark (bbt+2):bbt+2 = 60% + 0.95*(bt+1-60%)/3 + 0.952*(bt-60%)/3 + 0.953*(bt-1-60%)/3. When checking forwards, the same formula is applied as the backwards-checking formula, just with all the t-year-indexes being pushed two years forward.
:* The year referred to as &quot;t&quot; in the backward-looking and forward-looking formula listed above, is always the latest completed fiscal year with available outturn data. For example, a backward-check conducted in 2024 will always check whether outturn data from the completed 2023 fiscal year (t) featured a debt-to-GDP ratio (bt) at a level respecting the &quot;2023 debt reduction benchmark&quot; (bbt) calculated on basis of outturn data for the debt-to-GDP ratio from 2020+2021+2022, while the forward-looking check conducted in 2024 will be all about whether the forecast 2025-data (bt+2) will respect the &quot;2025 debt reduction benchmark&quot; (bbt+2) calculated on basis of debt-to-GDP ratio data for 2022+2023+2024. It shall be noted, that whenever a &quot;b&quot; input-value (debt-to-GDP ratio) is recorded/forecast below 60%, its data-input shall be replaced by a fictive 60% value in the formula.
:* Besides of the backward-looking debt-brake compliance check (bt formula_1 bbt) and forward-looking debt-brake compliance check (bt+2 formula_1 bbt+2), a third &quot;cyclically adjusted backward-looking debt-brake check (b*t formula_1 bbt)&quot; also form part of the assessment whether or not a member state is in abeyance with the debt-criterion. This check applies the same backwards-checking formula for the debt reduction bechmark (bbt), but now checks if the &quot;cyclically adjusted debt-to-GDP ratio&quot; (b*t) respects this calculated benchmark-limit (bbt) by being compliant with the equation: b*t formula_1 bbt. The exact formula used to calculate the &quot;cyclically adjusted debt-to-GDP ratio for the latest completed year t with outturn data (b*t)&quot;, is displayed by the formula box below.

If just one of the four quantitative debt-requirements (including the first one requesting the debt-to-GDP ratio to be below 60% in the latest recorded fiscal year) is complied with: or or or , then a member state will be declared to be in abeyance with the debt brake rule. Otherwise the Commission will declare existence of an &quot;apparent breach&quot; of the debt-criterion by the publication of a 126(3) report, which shall investigate if the &quot;apparent breach&quot; was &quot;real&quot; after having taken a range of allowed exemptions into consideration. Provided no special &quot;breach exemptions&quot; can be found to exist by the 126(3) report (i.e. finding the debt breach was solely caused by &quot;structural improving pension reforms&quot; or &quot;payment of bailout funds to financial stability mechanisms&quot; or &quot;payment of national funds to the new European Fund for Strategic Investments&quot; or &quot;appearance of an EU-wide recession&quot;), then the Commission will recommend the Council to open a debt-breached EDP against the member state by the publication of a 126(6) report.

For transitional reasons, the regulation granted all 23 EU member states with an ongoing EDP in November 2011, a 3year exemption period to comply with the rule, which shall start in the year when the member state have its 2011-EDP abrogated. For example, Ireland will only be obliged to comply with the new debt brake rule in 2019, if they, as expected, manage to correct their EDP in fiscal year 2015 – with the formal EDP abrogation then taking place in 2016. During the years where the 23 member states are exempted from complying with the new debt brake rule, they are still obliged to comply with the old debt brake rule that requires the debt-to-GDP ratios in excess of 60% to be &quot;sufficiently diminished&quot;, meaning that it must approach the 60% reference value at a &quot;satisfactory pace&quot; ensuring it will succeed to meet the debt reduction requirement of the new debt brake rule three years after its EDP is abrogated. This special transitional &quot;satisfactory pace&quot; is calculated by the Commission individually for each of the concerned member states, and is published to them in form of a figure for: &quot;The annually required Minimum Linear Structural Adjustment (MLSA) of the deficit in each of the 3 years in the transition period – ensuring the compliance with the new debt brake rule by the end of the transition period.&quot;

==== Twopack ====
The Twopack consists of two Regulations that entered into force on 30 May 2013. They are exclusively applicable to eurozone member states and introduced additional coordination and surveillance of their budgetary processes. They were deemed necessary given the higher potential for spillover effects of budgetary policies in a common currency area. The additional regulations complement the SGP&#x27;s requirement for surveillance, by enhancing the frequency and scope of scrutiny of the member state&#x27;s policymaking, but do not place additional requirements on the policy itself. The degree of surveillance will depend on the economic health of the member state.

Regulation 473/2013 is directed at all eurozone member states and requires a draft budgetary plan for the upcoming year to be submitted annually by 15 October, for a SGP compliance assessment conducted by the European Commission. The member state shall then await receiving the Commission&#x27;s opinion before the draft budgetary plan is debated and voted for in their national parliament. The Commission will not be granted any veto right over the national parliaments potential pass of a fiscal budget, but will have the role to issue warnings in advance to the national parliaments, if the proposed draft budget is found to compromise the debt and deficit rules of the SGP. 
* The regulation requires that any eurozone member state subject to an open EDP shall also publish a &quot;status report for corrective action&quot; by 6 months intervals, with the frequency increased to quarterly reports if the state &quot;persistently fails to implement the Council recommendations for corrective measures in order to remedy the excessive deficit&quot;.

Regulation 472/2013 is concerned with the subgroup of eurozone member states experiencing or being threatened by financial instability, which is understood to be the case if the state has an ongoing Excessive Imbalance Procedure (EIP) or receives any macroeconomic financial assistance from EFSM/EFSF/ESM/IMF/other bilateral basis. These member states are made subject to even more in depth and frequent &quot;enhanced surveillance&quot;, in order to prevent a possible sovereign debt crises to emerge.
* The regulation requires that &quot;status reports for corrective action&quot; needs to be published on a quarterly basis, and that the Commission on that basis will be allowed to send warnings to the national parliament of the member state concerned, about a likely missed compliance with programme targets and/or the fiscal adjustment path to comply with EDP deadlines; at such an early stage in the process, that the affected member state still have sufficient time to implement needed counter-measures to prevent the possible delay of the required compliance.

==== Assessment and criticism ====
In the post-crisis period, the legal debate on EMU largely focused on assessing the effects of both the Six- and the Two-Pack on the SGP. Most scholars admit that a considerable improvement occurred in the field of budgetary enforcement, especially for what concerns the imposition of dissuasive sanctions upon noncompliant Members. However, critical positions generally outnumber positive ones.

Many have criticised the growing complexity of the enforcement procedures. The reform process had to reconcile a strong tightening of the EDP with the pressure for wider escape clauses. The tension between these opposite trends fostered the developments of complicated assessment criteria, often translated in sophisticated mathematical formulas. This not only induces confusion in the overall framework, but also makes the procedural outcome hardly predictable for Member States.

Another widespread criticism concerns the high democratic deficit embedded by the SGP. National policymakers are elected democratically backed up at national level, whereas the EU (in its quality of central watchdog) is only in an indirect way. The friction between the two levels is ever more perceived in periods of economic distress, when the quest for budgetary consolidation becomes more compelling. Scholars agree in referring the issue of democratic deficit to the lack of a more federalised institutional framework for the Eurozone economic governance. The argument goes that strongly legitimated Union institutions would avoid the need for penetrating surveillance mechanisms, as they would partially shift economic policymaking at central level.

=== Bailout programs ===
Because of the crisis, some Members lost access to financial markets to refinance their debt. Clearly, the SGP framework proved not enough to ensure the stability of the Eurozone. For this reason, a bailout facility was deemed necessary to face such extraordinary challenges. The first attempt was the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), specifically created in 2010 to help Greece, Portugal, and Ireland. However, a permanent facility was created two years later with the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The latter consists of an international treaty signed on 2 February 2012 by Eurozone Members only.

Ailing Members receive financial aid in the form of low-interest loans whose disbursement is attached policy conditionalities. The latter usually consist in Macroeconomic Adjustment Programs (MAPs) whose adoption is deemed necessary to fix the imbalances which gave rise to the original instability.

Bailout programs do not constitute enforcement procedure &quot;stricto sensu&quot;. However, since financial support always entails compliance with several budgetary and economic conditionalities, they can be construed as a sort of &quot;ex post&quot; enforcement mechanism.

== Reform 2024 ==
On 26 April 2023, the Commission presented three legislative proposals to implement a comprehensive reform of the EU fiscal framework:
* New Regulation on the preventive arm of the SGP: &quot;Regulation on the effective coordination of economic policies and multilateral budgetary surveillance, and repealing Council Regulation 1466/97.&quot;
* Regulation amending the corrective arm of the SGP: &quot;Regulation amending Regulation 1467/97 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure.&quot;
* Directive amending the Directive on national budgetary frameworks: &quot;Council Directive amending Directive 2011/85/EU on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States.&quot;

The proposed reform aims to strengthen public debt sustainability, promote sustainable and inclusive growth through reforms and investments, increase national ownership for fiscal plans and fiscal corrections, simplify the legal framework, move towards a greater medium-term approach to budgetary policies, and ensure more effective and coherent enforcement of the fiscal rules.

As per legal assessment of ECB, the Commissions reform proposals also aim to integrate the of the European Fiscal Compact (TSCG), and wherever provisions would be different this does not necessitate the subsequent amendment or repeal of the TSCG, because ensures that the TSCG provisions will always apply and be interpreted in accordance with the existing economic governance framework of the European Union.

In February 2024, the trilogue negotiations between the co-legislators ended with a provisional political agreement on the Commissions proposal for a comprehensive reform of the SGP rules. The reform will introduce acceptance of a slower adjustment path towards respecting the deficit and debt limit of the SGP, and extend the maximum duration of an Excessive Deficit Procedure from four to seven years if certain reform requirements are respected. The new revised rules will be finally adopted by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers before the 2024 European Parliament election; and fully applied starting from the presented drafts for 2025 budgets. The first &quot;national medium-term fiscal-structural plans&quot; guided by the new revised fiscal rules, will cover the four-year period 2025-2028, and need to be submitted by each member state by 20 September 2024.

The European Parliament is expected to vote on the new Regulation on the preventive arm in April 2024. After the Parliament&#x27;s approval, the Council of Ministers is expected to adopt the new Regulation, adopt the Regulation amending the corrective arm, and adopt the Directive amending the Directive on national budgetary frameworks. In the meantime, as a new legal framework is not yet in place, the current legal framework continues to apply in spring 2024.

===SGP changes induced by the reform ===
The reform was adopted and entered into force on 30 April 2024, and induced the following changes to the SGP:

* &quot;National medium-term fiscal-structural plans&quot; submitted annually by 20 September, will integrate and replace the previous &quot;Stability/Convergence programme&quot; and &quot;National Reform Programme&quot; submitted annually in April. While maintaining a 4-5 year time span for the duration of the programme/plan, the intention with the new plans are that the subsequent annually reporting will be limited to progress reports on how the implementation of the original plan is moving forward.
* The maximum duration of an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) will be extended from four to seven years if certain reform requirements are respected, for member states in need of a slower adjustment path towards respecting the deficit and debt limit of the SGP.
* The New debt reduction rule (Regulation 1177/2011) - also known as the debt reduction benchmark, will be repealed. In the future, a debt-based EDP can instead only be triggered for member states having a debt-to-GDP ratio above 60% along with a budget balance deficit, if the control account of the member state at the same time deviates from the country-specific agreed &quot;Net Expenditure Path&quot; by 0.3 percentage points of GDP annually, or 0.6 percentage points of GDP cumulatively. As 2025 will be the first fiscal year subjected to the reformed &quot;Net Expenditure Path&quot;, no member state can have the opening of a debt-based EDP in 2024. The procedure for launching a deficit-based EDP, due to a breach of the 3% deficit limit for the general government nominal budget balance, will however not be changed by the reform, and will therefore be assessed already in 2024.
* The Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO) and its related &quot;Significant Deviation Procedure&quot; within the preventive arm of the SGP, are both repealed.
* Fiscal surveillance will no longer focus on how the structural budget balance performs, but instead check if the annual percentage change of the &quot;nationally financed net primary expenditure&quot; of the member state stays within the agreed country-specific multi-year net expenditure path, as endorsed by the Council. This path will serve as a basis for carrying out annual fiscal surveillance over the lifetime of the Member State&#x27;s medium-term fiscal-structural plan. The &quot;nationally financed net primary expenditure&quot;, represents the figure for the overall general government expenditures but excluding: new additional expenditures financed by discretionary revenue measures such as new taxation measures (as per the word &quot;net&quot;), interest expenditures (as per the word &quot;primary&quot;), cyclical unemployment expenditures (making the figure neutral to the business cycle), national expenditures on co-financing of programmes funded by the EU, and expenditures on EU programmes fully matched by revenue from EU funds.
* For a member state having both a government deficit below the 3% of GDP reference value and public debt below the 60% of GDP reference value, the European Commission will now only provide technical advice upon the request of the concerned member state, on its country-specific target for the &quot;Structural Primary Balance&quot; necessary in order to ensure that both:
** The government deficit and debt also stay below both reference values, during its 4-5 year long &quot;National medium-term fiscal-structural plan&quot; plus for an additional assumed no-fiscal-policy-change 10-year period beyond.
** The government deficit throughout the same 14-15 years period complies with the new &quot;deficit resilience safeguard&quot; (Article 6b), that requires an annual positive fiscal adjustment for the Structural Primary Balance of at least 0.4% of GDP (or 0.25% in case the adjustment period and plan is extended to 7 years) until the structural balance is above or equal to -1.5% of GDP.
** The technical advice for the &quot;Structural Primary Balance&quot; target meeting both criteria above, shall be calculated as per the outlined methodology described in the latest &quot;Debt Sustainability Monitor&quot; report. When knowing the recommended &quot;Structural Primary Balance&quot; target, then the maximum allowed limit for the annual &quot;Nominal net primary expenditure growth&quot; can be calculated per this formula:
* For member states with a public debt above the 60% of GDP reference value or a government deficit above the 3% of GDP reference value, the European Commission will issue reference trajectories for the country-specific net expenditure path, ensuring a compliance with both reference values for debt and deficit in the future. The net expenditure path set annual limits for how much the net expenditure of the general government can grow, and will be determined and communicated by the European Commission ahead of the publication of the first national medium-term fiscal-structural plan, with a default adjustment period covering the four years of the plan - but with a possible extension of the adjustment period by a maximum of three additional years if certain reform requirements are met. The reference trajectories for the country-specific net expenditure path shall be set in compliance with these five subcriteria:
** Government deficit is brought and maintained below 3% of GDP by the end of the EDP period.
** Government deficit shall after being recorded below 3% of GDP, further converge towards a &quot;common resilience margin&quot; below the 3% of GDP deficit limit. This new criteria is called the &quot;deficit resilience safeguard&quot; (Article 6b), that requires a further annual positive fiscal adjustment for the Structural Primary Balance of at least 0.4% of GDP (or 0.25% in case the adjustment period and plan is extended to 7 years) until the structural balance is above or equal to -1.5% of GDP.
** Projected public debt-to-GDP ratios above 60% shall decrease by a minimum annual average, in line with the debt sustainability safeguard, as per the outlined methodology described in the latest &quot;Debt Sustainability Monitor&quot; report. The debt sustainability safeguard will ensure that the government debt ratio decreases by a minimum annual average of 1% of GDP as long as the member state&#x27;s debt ratio exceeds 90%, or of 0.5% of GDP as long as the member state&#x27;s debt ratio remains between 60% and 90%. 
** The fiscal effort over the horizon of the plan is linear and at least proportional to the total effort over the entire adjustment period, and will by default have a duration of 4 years, although it can be extended to 7 years if certain reform requirements are met.
** While having a nominal budget balance deficit above 3% of GDP, the structural deficit of the general government shall be improved by a fiscal adjustment of minimum 0.5% of GDP per year as a benchmark, even if the four other subcriteria above would allow for a lower annual adjustment. If the four other subcritera demand a higher than 0.5% of GDP annual adjustment, this higher adjustment will be required instead. 
* The standard fine in case of non-compliance with the EDP targets, was 0.2% of GDP in the previous version of the SGP, but will after the reform now amount to up to 0.05% of GDP and accumulate every six months until &quot;effective action&quot; by the member state concerned is taken. After the reform &quot;effective action&quot; will be deemed taken, if the net expenditure is corrected to a level in compliance with the agreed &quot;Net Expenditure Path&quot;.
* The previous &quot;general escape clause&quot; was not changed by the reform. As activation/deactivation of this clause however covered the entire eurozone/EU as a whole entity, the reform now also introduced a &quot;national escape clause&quot;, which may be activated by the Council if this is requested by a member state and recommended by the European Commission. A potential activation of a &quot;national escape clause&quot; would suspend the rules only for the member state concerned for a time-limited period, in the event that exceptional circumstances outside the control of that member state have a major impact on its public finances, but only if the activation itself will not endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term.

== Member states by SGP criteria ==
Both eurozone and non-eurozone EU member states are subjected to a regular compliance check with the SGP deficit and debt criterion. Minimum one ordinary check per year was conducted for all member states since 1998, and minimum two ordinary checks per year for all eurozone member states since the twopack reform entered into force in 2013. If just one of the two criteria is not complied with when conducting the first numerical check, and the following investigative article 126(3) report of the Commission concludes this &quot;apparent breach&quot; was non-exempted, then there will be the opening of an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) against the concerned member state - declared by the Council&#x27;s adoption of a 126(6) report; and a deadline for the needed correction of the criteria breach - along with annual targets for the structural deficit and nominal budget balance - will be set by the simultaneous adoption of a 126(7) report.

The EDP - also known as the corrective arm of the SGP, was however suspended via activation of the &quot;general escape clause&quot; during 2020-2023 to allow for higher deficit spending; first due to the Covid-19 pandemic arriving as an extraordinary circumstance, and later during 2022-2023 due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine having sent energy prices up, defence spending up and budgetary pressures up across the EU. Despite the EDP suspension in 2020-2023, Romania still experienced the opening of an EDP in April 2020; but only because of existence of a deficit limit breach being recorded already for its 2019 fiscal year, which required corrective action across 2020-2024, to remedy a budgetary imbalance created before 2020.

=== Compliance in 2023 ===
The data in the table below are from the ordinary compliance check of all EU member states in May 2023, with outturn data for the 2022 fiscal year as they were published on the Eurostat website in April 2023, and budget values for 2023-2026 as they were reported by the submitted Stability programme or Convergence programme of each member state in April 2023. 16 out of 27 member states had a technical &quot;SGP criteria breach&quot; when their 2022 fiscal results and 2023 budgets were analyzed in May 2023, but because those breaches were exempted due to the finding of temporary and exceptional circumstances - reflected by the activation of the general escape clause, no new EDPs were opened against those member states.


=== Compliance in 2024 ===
The EDP will be assessed again starting from 19 June 2024, where each country will have their usual set of a &quot;2024 National Reform Programme&quot; and &quot;2024 Stability or Convergence Programme&quot; analyzed, with a compliance check of the 2023 fiscal result and 2024 budget with the existing 2019-version of the SGP rules; although only 3% deficit breaches will be evaluated - because no debt limit or debt reduction breach can trigger an EDP in 2024. The European Commission reasoned for its continued deactivation for another year of the debt limit or debt reduction rule in 2023-2024: &quot;that compliance with the debt reduction benchmark could imply a too demanding frontloaded fiscal effort that would risk to jeopardise economic growth. Therefore, in the view of the Commission, compliance with the debt reduction benchmark is not warranted under the prevailing economic conditions.&quot;

10 out of 27 member states (Belgium, Czechia, France, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Spain) had a technical deficit-based &quot;SGP criteria breach&quot; as per their 2023 fiscal results published by Eurostat in April 2024. The European Commission will await receiving the budget values for 2024-2027 via the submitted Stability programme or Convergence programme of each member state, before deciding whether or not to open an EDP for the concerned member states. 

The 2024 SGP compliance table below will be updated with the latest data, as soon as the 2024 stability/convergence programme has been published for each country. The colors used to indicate compliance with the SGP criteria, are only preliminary selected based on whether the reported fiscal data exceeds the criteria limits after taking the Commission&#x27;s latest fiscal policy statements into consideration exempting all debt-related breaches, but without taking any additional factors or subcriteria into consideration when assessing compliance with the deficit criteria. The final assessment for compliance with the SGP criteria of each country, will be published by the European Commission on 19 June 2024, in the form of an article 126(3) assessment report investigating if the &quot;apparent breach&quot; was &quot;real&quot; (indicated by a red color) or can be &quot;exempted&quot; (indicated by a yellow color).


An article 126(3) assessment report can declare an apparent numerical breach &quot;exempted&quot; and hereby &quot;accepted&quot;, if the breach in example was solely caused by &quot;extra expenditures caused by implementation of structural improving pension reforms&quot; or &quot;payment of bailout funds to financial stability mechanisms&quot; or &quot;payment of national funds to the European Fund for Strategic Investments&quot; or &quot;appearance of an EU-wide recession&quot; or &quot;other temporary and extraordinary expences specifically allowed by the currently agreed fiscal policy of the EU&quot;. Any non-exempted breach of either the deficit or debt criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact declared by a 126(3) report, will however result in the publication of a 126(6) report and 126(7) report shortly afterwards, in which the Council will be recommended to open an EDP and set a deadline for when the breaching of the criteria shall have been corrected by the member state. If any EDP recommendation is issued by the Commission in June, then the EDP is expected to be formally adopted and opened by the Council in July.

==Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO)==

===1999–2005===
Across the first seven years, since the entry into force of the Stability and Growth Pact, all EU Member States were required to strive towards a common MTO being &quot;to achieve a budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus over a complete business cycle – while providing a safety margin towards continuously respecting the government&#x27;s 3% deficit limit&quot;. The first part of this MTO, was interpreted by the Commission Staff Service to mean &quot;continuously achievement each year throughout the business cycle of a &quot;cyclically-adjusted budget balance net of one-off and temporary measures&quot; (also referred to as the &quot;structural balance&quot;) at minimum 0.0%&quot;. In 2000, the second part was interpreted and operationalized into a calculation formula for the MTO also to respect the so-called &quot;Minimal Benchmark&quot; (later referred to as &quot;MTO Minimum Benchmark&quot;). When assessing the annual Convergence/Stability programmes of the Member States, the Commission Staff Service checked whether the structural balance of the state complied with both the common &quot;close to balance or surplus&quot; criteria and the country-specific &quot;Minimal Benchmark&quot; criteria. The last round under this assessment scheme took place in Spring 2005, while all subsequent assessments were conducted according to a new reformed scheme – introducing the concept of a single country-specific MTO as the overall steering anchor for the fiscal policy.

===Calculation of a country-specific Minimum MTO (2005–present)===
In order to ensure long-term compliance with the SGP deficit and debt criteria, the member states have since the SGP-reform in March 2005 striven towards achieving their country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO). The MTO is the set limit, that the structural balance relative to GDP needs to equal or be above for each year in the medium-term. Each state selects its own MTO, but it needs to equal or be better than a calculated minimum requirement (Minimum MTO) ensuring sustainability of the government accounts throughout the long-term (calculated on basis of both future potential GDP growth, future cost of government debt, and future increases in age-related costs).

The structural balance is calculated by the European Commission as the cyclically adjusted balance minus &quot;one-off measures&quot; (i.e. one-off payments due to reforming a pension scheme). The cyclically adjusted balance is calculated by adjusting the achieved general government balance (in % of GDP) compared to each year&#x27;s relative economic growth position in the business cycle (referred to as the &quot;output gap&quot;), which is found by subtraction of the achieved GDP growth with the potential GDP growth. So, if a year is recorded with average GDP growth in the business cycle (equal to the potential GDP growth rate), the output gap will then be zero, meaning that the &quot;cyclically-adjusted balance&quot; then will be equal to the &quot;government budget balance&quot;. In this way, because it is resistant to GDP growth changes, the structural balance is considered to be neutral and comparable across an entire business cycle (including both recession years and &quot;overheated years&quot;), making it perfect to be used consistently as a medium-term budgetary objective.

Whenever a country does not reach its MTO, it is required in the subsequent year(s) to implement annual improvements for its structural balance equal to minimum 0.5% of GDP, although several sub-rules (including the &quot;expenditure benchmark&quot;) has the potential slightly to alter this requirement. When Member States are in this process of improving their structural balance until it reaches its MTO, they are referred to as being on the &quot;adjustment path&quot;, and they shall annually report an updated target year for when they expect to reach their MTO. It is the responsibility of each Member State through a note in their annual Convergence/Stability report, to select their contemporary MTO at a point being equal to or above the &quot;minimum MTO&quot; calculated every third year by the European Commission (most recently in October 2012). The &quot;minimum MTO&quot; that the &quot;nationally selected MTO&quot; needs to respect, is equal to the strictest of the following three limits :

(1) MTOMB 

(2) MTOILD 

(3) MTOea/erm2/fc .
The third minimum limit listed above (MTOea/erm2/fc), mean that EU member states having ratified the Fiscal Compact and being bound by its fiscal provisions in Title III (which requires a special additional declaration of intent for non-eurozone member states), are obliged to select a MTO which does not exceed a structural deficit of 1.0% of GDP at maximum if they have a debt-to-GDP ratio significantly below 60%, and of 0.5% of GDP maximum if they have a debt-to-GDP ratio above 60%. In 2013-22, the following six states were not bound by the fiscal provisions of the Fiscal Compact: &quot;UK, Czech Republic, Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Hungary.&quot; Croatia became bound by the Fiscal Compact provisions and its stricter -0.5% limit when they adopted the euro on 1 January 2023, and were bound by the -1.0% limit while being an ERM-2 member from 10 July 2020 until 31 December 2022. Those of the non-eurozone member states neither being ERM-2 members nor having committed to respect the fiscal provisions of the Fiscal Compact (&quot;Czech Republic, Poland, Sweden, and Hungary,&quot; as of April 2024), will still be required to set a national MTO respecting the calculated &quot;minimum MTO&quot; being equal to the strictest limit set by MTOMB and MTOILD.

The only EU member state ever exempted from complying with this MTO procedure outlined above, was the former member UK, as it was exempted from complying with the SGP per a protocol to the EU treaty. In other words, while all other member states are obliged nationally to select a MTO respecting their calculated Minimum MTO, the calculated Minimum MTO for the UK were only presented by the European Commission for advice, with no obligation for the UK to set a compliant national MTO in structural terms.

The &quot;Minimum MTOs&quot; are recalculated every third year by the Economic and Financial Committee, based on the above-described procedure and formulas, that among others require the prior publication of the commission&#x27;s triennial Ageing Report. Although member states having an open &quot;macroeconomic adjustment programme&quot; covering the entire first year of which a recalculated &quot;Minimum MTO&quot; should have applied, shall not be subject to recalculation of its MTOILD due to an ongoing implementation of structural reforms as part of that program, and consequently will not be bound by any &quot;Minimum MTO&quot; for this specific threeyear period (i.e. Greece in 2012-15 and 2015-18, while a &quot;Minimum MTO was calculated for 2010 due to its first 2010-12 programme only starting in May 2010). A Member State can also have its &quot;Minimum MTO&quot; updated outside the ordinary threeyear schedule, if it implements structural reforms with a major impact on the long-term sustainability of public finances (i.e. a major pension reform) – and subsequently submit a formal request for an extraordinary recalculation.

In example, after the ordinary recalculation of minimum MTOs had been conducted by the Commission staff service in autumn 2012, based partially on input values from the 2012 Ageing report published in November 2011, many extraordinary recalculations were subsequently conducted during 2013-14. The MTOILD limits for Belgium, Denmark, Hungary and the Netherlands were revised in 2013, due to the impact of their 2012 pension reforms only subsequently being incorporated for some updated S2COA values in the Commission&#x27;s Fiscal Sustainability Report 2012 released on 18 December 2012. The MTOILD limits were also later revised in a similar fashion for Spain, Poland, Latvia, Slovakia, and Slovenia, as the data impact from their 2012 enacted pension reforms had only been assessed with publication of some revised S2COA values by graph 5.4 in the July 2014 report entitled &quot;2014 Stability and Convergence Programmes: An Overview&quot;. The revised S2COA values due to enacted pension reforms consequently changed the calculated MTOILD limits to less strict limits, for all of the concerned countries. 

In March 2017, the Commission made a commitment to begin updating the MTO minimum benchmark (MTOMB) annually in March/April (based on recalculated ROG input data from its latest autumn economic forecast), as the MTOMB had become a critical part of how the recently introduced &quot;Flexibility Clauses&quot; (a collective term for the &quot;Structural Reform Clause&quot; and &quot;Investment Clause&quot;) were applied, when making the annual assessment of compliance with the deficit and debt criteria for each member state within the preventive arm of the SGP. Except from the situation where a member state request an extraordinary recalculation of its MTOILD (due to implementation of major structural reforms), all calculated &quot;Minimum MTOs&quot; will however remain frozen for the entire threeyear period it covers, and not be changed by the annually revised MTOMB.

The table below, display the input data and calculated &quot;Minimum MTOs&quot; only from the five latest ordinary recalculations, with no display of any potential extraordinary recalculations in between.

===Nationally selected MTOs (2005–present)===
Whenever a &quot;Minimum MTO&quot; gets recalculated for a country, the announcement of a &quot;nationally selected MTO&quot; that is equal to or above this recalculated &quot;Minimum MTO&quot; shall occur as part of the following ordinary stability/convergence report, while only taking effect compliance-wise for the fiscal account(s) in the years after the new &quot;nationally selected MTO&quot; has been announced. The tables below have listed all country-specific MTOs selected by national governments throughout 2005–2015, and colored each year red/green to display whether or not the &quot;nationally selected MTO&quot; was achieved, according to the latest revision of the structural balance data as calculated by the &quot;European Commission method&quot;. Some states, i.e. Denmark and Latvia, apply a national method to calculate the structural balance figures reported in their convergence report (which greatly differs from the results of the commission&#x27;s method), but for the sake of presenting comparable results for all Member States, the &quot;MTO achieved&quot; coloring of the tables (and if not met also the noted forecast year of reaching it) is decided solely by the results of the commission&#x27;s calculation method.

==Criticism==
The Pact has been criticised by some as being insufficiently flexible and needing to be applied over the economic cycle rather than in any one year. The problem is, that countries in the EMU cannot react to economic shocks with a change of their monetary policy since it is coordinated by the ECB and not by national central banks. Consequently, countries must use fiscal policy i.e. government spending to absorb the shock. They fear that by limiting governments&#x27; abilities to spend during economic slumps may intensify recessions and hamper growth. In contrast, other critics think that the Pact is too flexible; economist Antonio Martino writes: &quot;The fiscal constraints introduced with the new currency must be criticized not because they are undesirable—in my view they are a necessary component of a liberal order—but because they are ineffective. This is amply evidenced by the &quot;creative accounting&quot; gimmickry used by many countries to achieve the required deficit to GDP ratio of 3 per cent, and by the immediate abandonment of fiscal prudence by some countries as soon as they were included in the euro club. Also, the Stability Pact has been watered down at the request of Germany and France.&quot;

The Maastricht criteria has been applied inconsistently: the Council failed to apply sanctions against the first two countries that broke the 3% rule: France and Germany, yet punitive proceedings were started (but fines never applied) when dealing with Portugal (2002) and Greece (2005). In 2002 the European Commission President (1999–2004) Romano Prodi described it as &quot;stupid&quot;, but was still required by the Treaty to seek to apply its provisions.

The Pact has proved to be unenforceable against big countries that dominate the EU economically, such as France and Germany, which were its strongest promoters when it was created. These countries have run &quot;excessive&quot; deficits under the Pact definition for some years. The reasons that larger countries have not been punished include their influence and large number of votes on the Council, which must approve sanctions; their greater resistance to &quot;naming and shaming&quot; tactics, since their electorates tend to be less concerned by their perceptions in the European Union; their weaker commitment to the euro compared to smaller states; and the greater role of government spending in their larger and more enclosed economies. The Pact was further weakened in 2005 to waive France&#x27;s and Germany&#x27;s violations.

<text>Ronald A. Route (born October 24, 1949) is a retired Vice Admiral and former Naval Inspector General of the United States Navy and a former President of the Naval War College. On July 16, 2013, Vice Admiral Route was named President of the Naval Postgraduate School.

==Naval career==
A native of Denver, Colorado, Route graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1971, and subsequently completed a series of command and leadership assignments both within the Navy and in the Joint Service arena. He commanded the guided-missile destroyer , the guided-missile cruiser , Cruiser-Destroyer Group Two, and the Carrier Battle Group. In addition to his afloat commands, he served at sea with Cruiser-Destroyer Group Two and Destroyer Squadron Four, and aboard the guided-missile cruiser , the frigate , the guided-missile cruiser , and the destroyer .

Ashore, Route commanded the Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC). From 9 July 2003 to 12 August 2004, he was the 50th officer to serve as President of the Naval War College since the college″s founding in 1884. During his tour as president, he sharpened the college″s focus on mission and relevance; initiated research, analysis, and wargaming to address key operational concerns of the U.S. Navy such as ballistic missile defense and antisubmarine warfare and established the Halsey Scholars, an advanced research program for selected students; and facilitated discussions between retired Soviet Navy officers and their American counterparts on Cold War naval history. Route assumed his duties as Naval Inspector General in August 2004 after leaving the presidency of the Naval War College. His other flag assignments included two tours on the Chief of Naval Operations staff, first as Director, Politico-Military Affairs Division (N52) and later as Director, Navy Programming Division (N80), where he developed and prioritized a multi-year spending plan for the Navy&#x27;s $80–$100 billion annual budget.

Route″s Pentagon assignments also included Executive Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) for three assistant secretaries in two presidential administrations, Long-Range Planner and Surface Ship Readiness analyst in the Chief of Naval Operations&#x27;s Program Resource Appraisal Division (now N81), and Naval Warfare Analyst in the Joint Analysis Directorate (now part of J8), within the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Route retired from the Navy in January 2008 after more than 36 years on active duty. In October 2013, Route became the second civilian president of the Naval Postgraduate School. He presided over the university as it rose from restrictions resulting from a Naval Inspector General&#x27;s report. Route&#x27;s accomplishments in moving NPS forward are highly significant.

<text>Knightstown (, also ), alternatively called Knight&#x27;s Town, is a village and the largest settlement on Valentia Island, County Kerry, in Ireland. It lies within the townland of Farranreagh, at the eastern tip of the island. As of the CSO census of 2022, Knightstown had a population of 244.

== History ==
In 1830 Maurice FitzGerald, the 18th Knight of Kerry, commissioned Scottish engineer Alexander Nimmo to draw up plans for a new village. During the 1840s, development began on what was initially known as the New Town of Valentia.
== Locality ==
The local RNLI lifeboat station moved to Knightstown in 1869 from Reenard Point and has since been known as the Valentia Lifeboat Station. There is a selection of local coffee shops and bars in the town, as well as Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland churches.
Knightstown is also the location of the car ferry connection between Valentia Island and Reenard Point on the mainland.

The area served as a base of operations for the laying of the first successful Transatlantic telegraph cable to Heart&#x27;s Content, completed in 1866. A cable station operated until it was closed in 1966. The history of the transatlantic cable and artifacts from it can be seen at the local history museum located in Knightstown.

Knightstown participates in the annual &quot;Tidy Towns&quot; competition where it is regularly recognized for the quality and cleanliness of its environment.

His biggest hits included three number one entries on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart: &quot;The Chokin&#x27; Kind&quot; (1969), &quot;Power of Love&quot; (1972), and &quot;Get Down, Get Down (Get on the Floor)&quot; (1975). In 2021, he was one of the 60 nominees for the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

==Career==
Simon was born in Simmesport, Louisiana, United States. Similar to many other African American artists from the era, Simon began singing in his father&#x27;s Baptist church. He pursued his vocal abilities full-time once the family moved to Richmond (near Oakland, California) in the late 1950s. There Simon joined the Golden West Gospel Singers and became influenced by Sam Cooke and Arthur Prysock. With this, the group decided to turn secular and recorded &quot;Little Island Girl&quot; as the Golden Tones in 1959.

Hush Records label owners Gary and Carla Thompson urged Simon to record on his own, and in 1964 Simon scored a minor hit on the Vee-Jay label with &quot;My Adorable One&quot;. Simon scored again in 1965 on the Chicago-based label with &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Over&quot;, which landed a #13 spot on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. However, the Vee-Jay label folded soon after the latter song&#x27;s release and Simon found himself travelling across the country singing.

Simon caught the eye of Nashville, Tennessee, R&amp;B disc jockey John Richbourg during this time, and Richbourg not only became Simon&#x27;s manager/record producer but also brought the singer to Monument Records&#x27; subsidiary label Sound Stage 7 in 1966. That year Simon released &quot;Teenager&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, which peaked at #11 on Billboard&#x27;s R&amp;B chart. Within the next two years, Simon released a string of hits: &quot;(You Keep Me) Hanging On&quot;, &quot;The Chokin&#x27; Kind&quot; (&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 #13), &quot;Farther on Down The Road&quot;, and &quot;Yours Love&quot;. &quot;The Chokin&#x27; Kind&quot; was written by Harlan Howard, spent 12 weeks in the charts, and had sold one million copies by June 16, 1969. In addition, Simon was given a Grammy Award in 1970 for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance.

In 1969, his composition &quot;My Special Prayer&quot;, which had been a minor US hit for himself and for Percy Sledge, went to number one on the Dutch Top 40 in Sledge&#x27;s version, spending 32 weeks on chart in two separate chart runs.

Under the encouragement of Richbourg, Simon moved to the Polydor distributed Spring Records label in 1970, which paired Simon with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The team scored a #3 R&amp;B hit in 1971 with &quot;Drowning in the Sea of Love&quot; and a #1 R&amp;B hit in the summer of 1972 with &quot;Power of Love&quot;. Both songs reached #11 on the Hot 100. &quot;Drowning in the Sea of Love&quot; sold over 1.5 million copies and the RIAA on January 6, 1972, gave a gold disc. &quot;Power of Love&quot;, written by Gamble, Huff and Simon was Simon&#x27;s third million seller, and the R.I.A.A. awarded gold disc status on August 29, 1972.

Simon continued to release R&amp;B hits with &quot;Pool of Bad Luck&quot;, &quot;Trouble in My Home&quot;, &quot;Step By Step&quot; (his only UK success), &quot;I Need You, You Need Me&quot;, &quot;Music in My Bones&quot;, &quot;Carry Me&quot;, and 1975&#x27;s &quot;Get Down, Get Down (Get on the Floor)&quot;, which gave Simon his third #1 R&amp;B hit, and also a #8 Hot 100 hit. Simon&#x27;s success escalated with his writing/producing the theme tune for the film &quot;Cleopatra Jones&quot; in 1973.

In the late 1970s/early 1980s, Simon decided to remove his tenor/bass-baritone voice from the secular music world and devote it and other parts of his life to Christianity. Simon began evangelical preaching in Flossmoor, Illinois. In 1983, he produced the album &quot;Lay My Burden Down&quot; for former Davis Sisters second lead Jackie Verdell. Simon briefly returned to secular music in 1985 for his &quot;Mr. Right&quot; album, though none of its singles charted. He went on to release a gospel album titled &quot;This Story Must Be Told&quot; in the late 1990s.

In 1999, Simon was inducted as a Pioneer Award honoree by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. He died on December 13, 2021. Sources gave his age as 85, in contrast to sources during his lifetime that had indicated a later year of birth. Simon&#x27;s wife Melanie informed the Journal of Gospel Music of his death: &quot;Joe had been ill for some time and spent his final night at home with her, even talking about going back into the studio. He died of breathing problems in an ambulance on his way to hospital. His funeral is planned for 22nd December.&quot;

<text>Acklins is an island and district of the Bahamas.

It is one of a group of islands arranged along a large, shallow lagoon called the Bight of Acklins, of which the largest are Crooked Island () in the north and Acklins () in the southeast, and the smaller are Long Cay (once known as Fortune Island, ()) in the northwest, and Castle Island in the south.

== Etymology ==
The indigenous Lucayan people called the Acklins as &quot;Yabaque&quot;, meaning &quot;large western land&quot;.

==History==
The islands were settled by American Loyalists in the late 1780s who set up cotton plantations maintained by over 1,000 slaves. After the abolition of slavery in the British Empire the plantations became uneconomical, and the replacement income from sponge diving has now dwindled as well with the rest of the natural sponge industry after the advent of synthetics. The inhabitants now live by fishing and small-scale farming.
Although Acklins Island has relatively few historical landmarks, there are some noteworthy places. Acklins is home to numerous Lucayan people sites. An ancient site, thought to be one of the largest Lucayan settlements in The Bahamas, sits along Pompey Bay Beach, just south of Spring Point. Ten ancient Lucayan sites have been unearthed by National Geographic Society archeologists on Samana Cay alone, which is northeast of Spring Point in Acklins.

Plana Cays, also northeast of Spring Point, is a protected reserve for endangered great iguanas and the very rare Bahamian hutia (a guinea pig-like rodent), the only native mammal of The Bahamas.

The population of Acklins was 565 at the 2010 census, with the largest populations at Lovely Bay in the northwestern tip of the island and in Salina Point in the southernmost area of the island.

==Transportation==
The island is served by Spring Point Airport.

== Politics ==
The island is part of the MICAL constituency for elections to the House of Assembly of the Bahamas.

<doc id="997096" wikidata="Q5074189" url="?curid=997096" title="Chard Canal">
<text>The Chard Canal was a tub boat canal in Somerset, England, that ran from the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal at Creech St. Michael, over four aqueducts, through three tunnels and four inclined planes to Chard. It was completed in 1842, was never commercially viable, and closed in 1868. The major engineering features are still clearly visible in the landscape.

==Precursors==
Prior to the construction of the canal, there had been several plans over the previous 50 years to build a ship canal from the Bristol Channel to the English Channel, in order to avoid the route around Cornwall and Devon. The first which would have connected Chard to the canal network was a scheme surveyed in 1769 by Robert Whitworth, to link the River Parrett to Seaton in Devon. Whitworth was asked to reassess this route in the early 1790s, and again thought it was feasible. The plan was revived in 1793, while another route was suggested in 1794 by Josiah Easton, again passing through Chard.

The 1793 Chard Canal plan was revived in 1809, by now renamed as the English and Bristol Channels Canal, and the engineer John Rennie was asked to survey it in 1810. He advocated a small ship canal, suitable for vessels up to 120 tons. The cost of a barge canal had been estimated at £70,000, but Rennie&#x27;s estimate for a ship canal was £1.33 million. 

One further attempt to build a ship canal took place in 1825, when a canal capable of taking vessels of 200 tons, with a draught of was proposed. 30 locks would have been required, on a canal from Stolford on the Bristol Channel to Beer on the English Channel, passing through Creech St Michael, Ilminster and Chard, at an estimated cost of £1.7 million. Thomas Telford produced the survey, an act of Parliament, the English and Bristol Channels Ship Canal Act 1825 (6 Geo. 4. c. cxcix) was obtained on 6 July 1825, and although subscriptions of over £1.5 million were promised, no further action occurred, with the company disappearing after 1828.

==History==

With the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal having opened in 1827, there was further initiative to link Chard to it, and James Green carried out a survey in 1831. The route was long, but with Chard some higher than the canal at Creech St Michael, his plan involved two boat lifts, two inclined planes and two tunnels, and was costed at £57,000. An act of Parliament, the (4 &amp; 5 Will. 4. c. liii) was obtained in June 1834, authorising the raising of £57,000, with an additional £20,000 if required, but local enthusiasm for the scheme was muted and most of the capital was provided by just five men, all of whom were involved in the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal. 

Work began at Wrantage in June 1835, but the act did not allow parts of the canal to be built until tunnelling was well-advanced, and so work on the upper sections did not start until Autumn 1837. Green was replaced as engineer by Sydney Hall from the start of construction, and in view of the problems Green was experiencing on the Grand Western Canal with commissioning his boat lifts, Hall decided to replace the lifts with inclined planes instead.

Further changes to the original plans were made above Ilminster inclined plane, where another tunnel was constructed, enabling the line of the canal to be built at a lower level. A lock was added at Bere Mills, to raise the line by and the length of the Chard incline was increased. Construction costs were much higher than anticipated, and another act of Parliament, the &#x27; (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. i) was obtained in March 1840, allowing the company to raise another £80,000 in shares, and to obtain a mortgage for £26,000, while a third act, the &#x27; (4 &amp; 5 Vict. c. x) allowed construction to continue beyond the original seven year limit. The canal opened to Ilminster on 15 May 1841, and to Dowlish Ford wharfs on 3 February 1842. 

There were delays caused by the rope on the Wrantage plane breaking, resulting in damage to the caissons, and further delays caused by the Bristol and Exeter Railway constructing their line under the canal at Creech, but the work was finally completed on 24 May 1842. There were immediate benefits to the community, as coal prices fell, but the total cost of construction had been about £140,000, and as income was only a third of what had been projected, the canal company was never able to meet even the interest payments on its debts.

==Operation==
The canal was designed for tub-boats which were . The inclines at Thornfalcon, Wrantage and Ilminster were double-acting inclines, consisting of two parallel tracks, each containing a six-wheeled caisson, in which the boats floated. A chain linked the two caissons together, passing round a horizontal drum situated at the top of the incline. Power for the movement of the boats was provided by over-filling the top caisson, the extra weight causing that caisson to descend and the other to rise. Because the majority of traffic passed up the canal, and a boat displaces its own weight in water (Archimedes&#x27; principle), considerably more water passed down the incline than up it. However, the system was still more economical than using locks, and a large new Chard Reservoir supplied the necessary water. 

The incline at Chard Common was quite different, consisting of a single track, with the tub-boats being carried on a cradle with four wheels. Power was supplied by a Whitelaw and Stirrat water turbine, with a head, which used of water per minute. Boats were raised in a wheeled cradle up a slope of 1:10. The cradle was attached to the turbine by a substantial wire rope, after breakages of the original rope. The Ilminster tunnel was wide, allowing boats travelling in opposite directions to pass, but the tunnels at Lillesdon and Crimson Hill were only wide enough for one boat. However the Crimson Hill Tunnel has a double width &quot;passing area&quot; about halfway through its course to allow passing of the boats from either direction.

The main cargoes were coal and stone. Traffic for the first three years rose from 25,835 tons to 33,284 tons, about two thirds of which was coal or culm (anthracite). Competition started immediately, with the railway arriving at Taunton in 1842, and the Westport Canal being completed in 1840. Attempts were made to convert the canal to a railway, and an act of Parliament, the (10 &amp; 11 Vict. c. clxxv) obtained in 1847 changed the name of the company to the Chard Railway Company, but successive plans were thwarted by the inability of the company to repay its debts. 

The canal went into receivership in 1853, after which there were discussions with the Bristol and Exeter Railway and the London and South Western Railway, with a view to building a branch to Chard. A new Chard Railway Company was constituted in 1860, and another company was formed in 1861, to construct a branch from Taunton to Chard. The London and South Western Railway took over the Chard Railway, and the Bristol and Exeter built the branch from Taunton to Chard. 

In order to prevent competition from the L&amp;SWR, the Bristol and Exeter Railway bought the Grand Western Canal, the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal and the Chard Canal, so that the L&amp;SWR could not. They paid £5,945 for the Chard Canal, with the takeover and closing of the canal being authorised by the Bristol and Exeter Railway Act 1867 (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. cxxx). The receivers were discharged in February 1868, and it seems likely that the canal was closed then.

==Remains==

The Chard reservoir, which was the main supply for the canal, was sold to Lord Poulett. In 1990, South Somerset District Council bought it, and it is now a designated nature reserve. Surrounded by woodland, it provides habitat for over 150 species of birds. The remains of the inclines have survived over 140 years of neglect, as have the three tunnels. Near Lower Farm, a bridge on the Thornfalcon to Creech road is now a grade II listed structure, and the three-arched aqueduct which carried the canal over the River Tone is largely intact, although it no longer has its parapets.

During World War II part of the Taunton Stop Line invasion defence project ran along the canal.

<doc id="997097" wikidata="Q2268240" url="?curid=997097" title="Elliptic orbit">
<text>In astrodynamics or celestial mechanics, an elliptic orbit or elliptical orbit is a Kepler orbit with an eccentricity of less than 1; this includes the special case of a circular orbit, with eccentricity equal to 0. In a stricter sense, it is a Kepler orbit with the eccentricity greater than 0 and less than 1 (thus excluding the circular orbit). In a wider sense, it is a Kepler orbit with negative energy. This includes the radial elliptic orbit, with eccentricity equal to 1. They are frequently used during various astrodynamic calculations.

In a gravitational two-body problem with negative energy, both bodies follow similar elliptic orbits with the same orbital period around their common barycenter. The relative position of one body with respect to the other also follows an elliptic orbit.

Examples of elliptic orbits include Hohmann transfer orbits, Molniya orbits, and tundra orbits.

==Velocity==
Under standard assumptions, no other forces acting except two spherically symmetrical bodies formula_1 and formula_2, the orbital speed (formula_3) of one body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed from the vis-viva equation as:
:formula_4
where:
*formula_5 is the standard gravitational parameter, formula_6, often expressed as formula_7 when one body is much larger than the other.
*formula_8 is the distance between the orbiting body and center of mass.
*formula_9 is the length of the semi-major axis.
The velocity equation for a hyperbolic trajectory has either formula_10, or it is the same with the convention that in that case formula_11 is negative.

== Orbital period ==
Under standard assumptions the orbital period (formula_12) of a body travelling along an elliptic orbit can be computed as: 
:formula_13
where:
*formula_14 is the standard gravitational parameter.
*formula_9 is the length of the semi-major axis.
Conclusions:
*The orbital period is equal to that for a circular orbit with the orbital radius equal to the semi-major axis (formula_9),
*For a given semi-major axis the orbital period does not depend on the eccentricity (See also: Kepler&#x27;s third law).

==Energy==
Under standard assumptions, the specific orbital energy (formula_17) of an elliptic orbit is negative and the orbital energy conservation equation (the Vis-viva equation) for this orbit can take the form: 
:formula_18
where:
*formula_3 is the orbital speed of the orbiting body,
*formula_8 is the distance of the orbiting body from the central body,
*formula_21 is the length of the semi-major axis,
*formula_5 is the standard gravitational parameter.
Conclusions:
*For a given semi-major axis the specific orbital energy is independent of the eccentricity.

Using the virial theorem to find:
*the time-average of the specific potential energy is equal to −2ε
**the time-average of &quot;r&quot;−1 is &quot;a&quot;−1
*the time-average of the specific kinetic energy is equal to ε

=== Energy in terms of semi major axis ===
It can be helpful to know the energy in terms of the semi major axis (and the involved masses). The total energy of the orbit is given by
:formula_23,

where a is the semi major axis.

==== Derivation ====
Since gravity is a central force, the angular momentum is constant:
:formula_24

At the closest and furthest approaches, the angular momentum is perpendicular to the distance from the mass orbited, therefore:
:formula_25.

The total energy of the orbit is given by 
:formula_26.

Substituting for v, the equation becomes
:formula_27.

This is true for r being the closest / furthest distance so two simultaneous equations are made, which when solved for E:
:formula_28

Since formula_29 and formula_30, where epsilon is the eccentricity of the orbit, the stated result is reached.

==Flight path angle==
The flight path angle is the angle between the orbiting body&#x27;s velocity vector (equal to the vector tangent to the instantaneous orbit) and the local horizontal. Under standard assumptions of the conservation of angular momentum the flight path angle formula_31 satisfies the equation: 
:formula_32
where:
* formula_33 is the specific relative angular momentum of the orbit,
* formula_3 is the orbital speed of the orbiting body,
* formula_8 is the radial distance of the orbiting body from the central body,
* formula_36 is the flight path angle

formula_37 is the angle between the orbital velocity vector and the semi-major axis. formula_38 is the local true anomaly. formula_39, therefore,
:formula_40 
:formula_41

where formula_42 is the eccentricity.

The angular momentum is related to the vector cross product of position and velocity, which is proportional to the sine of the angle between these two vectors. Here formula_31 is defined as the angle which differs by 90 degrees from this, so the cosine appears in place of the sine.

==Equation of motion==
===From initial position and velocity===

An orbit equation defines the path of an orbiting body formula_44 around central body formula_45 relative to formula_45, without specifying position as a function of time. If the eccentricity is less than 1 then the equation of motion describes an elliptical orbit. Because Kepler&#x27;s equation formula_47 has no general closed-form solution for the Eccentric anomaly (E) in terms of the Mean anomaly (M), equations of motion as a function of time also have no closed-form solution (although numerical solutions exist for both).

However, closed-form time-independent path equations of an elliptic orbit with respect to a central body can be determined from just an initial position (formula_48) and velocity (formula_49).
For this case it is convenient to use the following assumptions which differ somewhat from the standard assumptions above:

:# The central body&#x27;s position is at the origin and is the primary focus (formula_50) of the ellipse (alternatively, the center of mass may be used instead if the orbiting body has a significant mass)
:# The central body&#x27;s mass (m1) is known
:# The orbiting body&#x27;s initial position(formula_48) and velocity(formula_49) are known
:# The ellipse lies within the XY-plane

The fourth assumption can be made without loss of generality because any three points (or vectors) must lie within a common plane. Under these assumptions the second focus (sometimes called the &quot;empty&quot; focus) must also lie within the XY-plane: formula_53 .

====Using vectors====
The general equation of an ellipse under these assumptions using vectors is:

:formula_54

where:
*formula_9 is the length of the semi-major axis.
*formula_53 is the second (&quot;empty&quot;) focus.
*formula_57 is any (x,y) value satisfying the equation.
The semi-major axis length (a) can be calculated as:

:formula_58

where formula_59 is the standard gravitational parameter.
The empty focus (formula_53) can be found by first determining the Eccentricity vector:

:formula_61

Where formula_62 is the specific angular momentum of the orbiting body: 

:formula_63

Then

:formula_64

====Using XY Coordinates====
This can be done in cartesian coordinates using the following procedure:

The general equation of an ellipse under the assumptions above is:

:formula_65

Given:
:formula_66 the initial position coordinates
:formula_67 the initial velocity coordinates

and
:formula_68 the gravitational parameter

Then:
:formula_69 specific angular momentum
:formula_70 initial distance from F1 (at the origin)

:formula_71 the semi-major axis length
:formula_72 the Eccentricity vector coordinates
:formula_73
Finally, the empty focus coordinates
:formula_74
:formula_75
Now the result values &quot;fx, fy&quot; and &quot;a&quot; can be applied to the general ellipse equation above.

== Orbital parameters ==
The state of an orbiting body at any given time is defined by the orbiting body&#x27;s position and velocity with respect to the central body, which can be represented by the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (position of the orbiting body represented by x, y, and z) and the similar Cartesian components of the orbiting body&#x27;s velocity. This set of six variables, together with time, are called the orbital state vectors. Given the masses of the two bodies they determine the full orbit. The two most general cases with these 6 degrees of freedom are the elliptic and the hyperbolic orbit. Special cases with fewer degrees of freedom are the circular and parabolic orbit.

Because at least six variables are absolutely required to completely represent an elliptic orbit with this set of parameters, then six variables are required to represent an orbit with any set of parameters. Another set of six parameters that are commonly used are the orbital elements.

==Solar System==

In the Solar System, planets, asteroids, most comets, and some pieces of space debris have approximately elliptical orbits around the Sun. Strictly speaking, both bodies revolve around the same focus of the ellipse, the one closer to the more massive body, but when one body is significantly more massive, such as the sun in relation to the earth, the focus may be contained within the larger massing body, and thus the smaller is said to revolve around it. The following chart of the perihelion and aphelion of the planets, dwarf planets, and Halley&#x27;s Comet demonstrates the variation of the eccentricity of their elliptical orbits. For similar distances from the sun, wider bars denote greater eccentricity. Note the almost-zero eccentricity of Earth and Venus compared to the enormous eccentricity of Halley&#x27;s Comet and Eris.
==Radial elliptic trajectory==
A radial trajectory can be a double line segment, which is a degenerate ellipse with semi-minor axis = 0 and eccentricity = 1. Although the eccentricity is 1, this is not a parabolic orbit. Most properties and formulas of elliptic orbits apply. However, the orbit cannot be closed. It is an open orbit corresponding to the part of the degenerate ellipse from the moment the bodies touch each other and move away from each other until they touch each other again. In the case of point masses one full orbit is possible, starting and ending with a singularity. The velocities at the start and end are infinite in opposite directions and the potential energy is equal to minus infinity.

The radial elliptic trajectory is the solution of a two-body problem with at some instant zero speed, as in the case of dropping an object (neglecting air resistance).

==History==
The Babylonians were the first to realize that the Sun&#x27;s motion along the ecliptic was not uniform, though they were unaware of why this was; it is today known that this is due to the Earth moving in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with the Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.

In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun at one focus, and described this in his first law of planetary motion. Later, Isaac Newton explained this as a corollary of his law of universal gravitation.

<text>Ralph Randolph Gurley (May 26, 1797 – July 30, 1872) was an American clergyman, an advocate of the separation of the races, and a major force for 50 years in the American Colonization Society. It offered passage to free black Americans to the ACS colony in west Africa. It bought land from chiefs of the indigenous Africans. Because of his influence in fundraising and education about the ACS, Gurley is considered one of the founders of Liberia, which he named.

== Biography ==
Gurley was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, and gained an early education. He graduated from Yale College, B.A. in 1818. He moved to Washington, D.C., where he was licensed to preach as a Presbyterian.

On May 25, 1827, he married Eliza McLellan (1810?-1872). – (Note: different spelling in Gurley source – Eliza McLellen (1812–1872, uncertain). They had a large family, including William Henry Fitzhugh (1820) (this seems questionable as this birth was seven years before the couple married), Felicia Liberia Heneaus (1829), Ralph Randolph (1832–1833), Eliza (1834), Julia (1835), Mary Custis (1836), Ralph Randolph Gurley (b. 1841), Archibald Alexander (1841), Marion Ann Muirhead (1844), John McDonough &quot;Mackie&quot; (1846), and Caroline Rose Gurley (1847-died in infancy).

From 1822, Gurley began to work with the American Colonization Society. Although he was never ordained as a minister, Gurley was also appointed to serve as Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives for the 21st and 22nd Congresses (1829–1833), and again for the 30th and 31st (1847–1851), opening each day&#x27;s proceedings with a prayer.

== American Colonization Society ==
Starting as a young man of about 25, Gurley acted as the agent and secretary of the American Colonization Society from 1822, soon after its founding, until 1872. By that time the West African colony founded by the Society had declared independence in 1847 as the Republic of Liberia.

The ACS was founded as an uneasy alliance of abolitionists and slaveholders. Members of each group were seeking solutions to the place of free people of color or free blacks in United States society. Together members of this group proposed to relocate free American blacks to a new colony in West Africa. Chapters of the ACS were set up in several southern states, some of which initially funded their own relocation efforts to property they purchased in contiguous parcels along the African coast. Eventually they allowed it to be absorbed into the larger ACS enterprise.

While some ACS members referred to this transportation of blacks as &quot;repatriation&quot;, by this time most blacks in America, including slaves, were native born. Most free blacks, some of whom had achieved freedom before the Revolution, wanted to gain equal civil rights in the nation they regarded as their own. But over time, the ACS did attract some black pioneers willing to settle in West Africa.

Because of continued discrimination against free blacks in American society, and especially among the slave societies of the South, where they were thought to threaten the stability of the slave regimes, even some abolitionists believed that free American blacks and newly manumitted slaves might be better off founding their own society in West Africa, with the eventual goal of self-government. Such members believed that if alternative settlement for free blacks were available, with financial support by the ACS, more slaveholders might be encouraged to manumit their slaves. After Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion of 1831, most Southern states repealed the already limited rights of free blacks and free people of color, and strengthened laws meant to control them through banning education, worship without white ministers, and group assemblies, for instance. Manumissions were sharply limited, generally available only by individual act of the state legislatures for each person to be freed. This procedure was so difficult that few slaveholders pursued freeing their slaves.

During the first ten years of Gurley&#x27;s agency, the annual income of the society increased from $778 to $40,000. He traveled widely to deliver addresses in its behalf, as it needed funds to support the ships and relocation expenses of new settlers to Monrovia. He is considered one of the founders of Liberia, which he named.

Gurley also edited the public-relations organ of the ACS, the &quot;African Repository and Colonial Journal&quot;. He sailed to England to solicit aid in the work of colonization. As in the British effort, American missionaries accompanied the settlers to the major settlement, Monrovia, in order to aid in converting the indigenous Africans they encountered. He continued to express the highest motives for the project, even after Liberia gained independence from the ACA:
:&quot;How should Virginians universally rejoice in the great evidences of Civilization growing &amp; expanding on the west coast of Africa, through civilized Africans sent forth from their homes!&quot; (letter, November 4, 1857)

The British had earlier established their own colony in West Africa, at Freetown (now the capital of Sierra Leone), for resettlement of blacks from London, Nova Scotia (Black Loyalists had been settled there from the American colonies after the Revolutionary War), and Jamaican Maroons. In time, the British also resettled here captives who had been liberated from illegal slave ships after the banning of the Atlantic slave trade.

Former President James Madison was among prominent American slaveholders who supported the work of the ACS. He bequeathed $2000 (~$ in ) in his will through Gurley to the Society.

Gurley visited Africa three times: in 1824 for the ACS, in order to resolve a dispute between the settlers and the appointed governor, Jehudi Ashmun; in 1849 representing the US government, in order to report to it on the newly independent republic; and late in life, in 1868, on an independent trip on an ACS ship in a desire to see Liberia again, his life&#x27;s work.

Gurley also wrote a biography, &quot;Life of Jehudi Ashmun&quot; (1835), about the secretary of the Society who served as an early governor of the colony. He reported his &quot;Mission to England for the American Colonization Society&quot; (1841), and wrote an encomium, the &quot;Life and Eloquence of Reverend Sylvester Larned&quot; (1844).

In his biography of Ashmun (1835), Gurley wrote

<text>Shepherd Moons is the third studio album by Irish singer, songwriter and musician Enya, released on 4 November 1991 by WEA. After the unexpected critical and commercial success of her previous album &quot;Watermark&quot; (1988), Enya embarked on a worldwide promotional tour to support it. At its conclusion, she wrote and rehearsed new material for her next album with her long time recording partners, manager, arranger and producer Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. The album was recorded in Ireland and London and continued to display Enya&#x27;s sound of multi-tracked vocals with keyboards and elements of Celtic and new-age music.

&quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and became a greater commercial success than &quot;Watermark&quot;. It went to number one on the UK Albums Chart and peaked at number seventeen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States. The album was certified multi-platinum by the British Phonographic Industry and Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of 1.2 million and five million copies, respectively. Between 1991 and 1994, Enya released four singles from &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;: &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot;, &quot;How Can I Keep from Singing?&quot;, &quot;Book of Days&quot;, which charted at number ten in the United Kingdom, and &quot;Marble Halls&quot;. As with &quot;Watermark&quot;, Enya supported the album with a worldwide promotional tour that included several interviews and televised performances. In 1993, the album won Enya a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album, the first of four she has won in her career. It was reissued in 1992 and 2009; the latter was a Japanese release with bonus tracks.

== Background and writing ==
In September 1988, Enya released her second studio album &quot;Watermark&quot;. It became an unexpected commercial success, charting around the world helped by its international top-ten hit, &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;. The album propelled Enya to worldwide fame and she spent much of the following year travelling worldwide to promote it through interviews, appearances, and performances. With such a length of time for promotion, Enya felt the priority was to return to the studio and record a new album rather than spend further time planning and completing a concert tour, partly due to the various difficulties involved in recreating her studio-oriented sound in a live setting. Enya worked with her long time recording partners, manager, producer and arranger Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. The success of &quot;Watermark&quot; complicated the writing process at first. Enya recalled: &quot;I put a lot of pressure on myself at the beginning ... When I was composing new melodies I kept thinking &quot;Would this have gone on &quot;Watermark&quot;? Is it as good?&quot; Eventually I had to forget about this and start on a blank canvas and just really go with what felt right in the studio.&quot;
When the process got underway, she was able to forget about the success of &quot;Watermark&quot; and start again. She added, &quot;It felt like &quot;Watermark&quot; was a dream. It felt like it hadn&#x27;t happened. And in a way it&#x27;s nice because you can concentrate only on the music. You can forget about charts, how much you sold. You forget that.&quot; As with all her albums, Enya considered a strong melody as a fundamental part to her songwriting. Only when she has pieced one together, usually with vocal ideas or with piano accompaniment, does she then build a song around it. As with &quot;Watermark&quot;, Enya sings Irish, her first language, English, and Latin. Her Catholic upbringing and childhood experiences of hymns and church music, coupled with later studies in classical music, were big influences that helped form her albums. She gained inspiration from several sources and stories, including her personal diaries and her grandparents. Two tracks on &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; are traditional songs that Enya rearranged with Nicky. Initially, Enya felt worried that by recording non-original songs, she would be unable to perform them with the same amount of emotion as she might with her own compositions, though her strong feelings towards them coupled with their age, made recording them easier.

== Recording ==
&quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; was recorded with new equipment purchased with the profits from &quot;Watermark&quot;. Much of the album was recorded at Aigle Studio, the recording studio in the Ryans&#x27; home, then located in Artane, a northern suburb of Dublin. However, as with her two previous albums, recording and production had to relocate elsewhere as the Aigle facility lacked the correct equipment to complete the final mix and mastering. The album was finished at SARM West Studios in London, where &quot;How Can I Keep from Singing?&quot;, &quot;Book of Days&quot;, and &quot;Lothlórien&quot; were recorded with additional engineering and mixing carried out by Gregg Jackman. As with &quot;Watermark&quot;, several musicians were brought in to perform additional instruments. Andy Duncan plays percussion on &quot;Book of Days&quot;, Roy Jewitt plays the clarinet on &quot;Evacuee&quot; and &quot;Angeles&quot;, Liam O&#x27;Flionn plays the uilleann pipes on &quot;Smaointe...&quot;, Steve Sidwell plays the cornet on &quot;Evacuee&quot;, and Nicky performs percussion on &quot;Ebudæ&quot;.

Enya noticed a change in her own attitude when it came to recording &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, &quot;the difference ... is that I&#x27;ve mellowed&quot;. This was down to the greater amount of time Enya took away from the studio, particularly during &quot;quite difficult&quot; moments, while recording the album in comparison to &quot;Watermark&quot;. The process, she felt, improved her sense of creativity in the long run. In some parts on the album, Enya recorded 500 layered voices without sampling or replication. When the melody to a song was completed, Roma Ryan would write lyrics to it. Several months after recording and mixing was complete, Enya had not yet listened to the album. &quot;I will find any excuse not to. And honestly, I have never felt so miserable as finishing this album. It&#x27;s fear – fear that all your feelings and all your emotions have gone into the thing, and when you hear it, it won&#x27;t live up to your expectations for it.&quot;

Writer Molly Burke wrote about the album&#x27;s artwork: &quot;&quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; features Enya in what can only be described as an opera gown she could be twenty or forty but her delicate beauty is intact. There is a sense of timelessness here bathed in the dark but fragile blue of sorrow&quot;.

== Songs ==
=== Side one ===
As with &quot;Watermark&quot;, the album title opens with an instrumental title track with wordless vocals. Its title, devised by Roma, refers to two inner satellite moons around Saturn discovered in 1980, Pandora and Prometheus, that &quot;protect and preserve the rings very much like a shepherd guiding his flock&quot;. Enya also liked the title as the association with the moon &quot;is quite romantic&quot;.

&quot;Caribbean Blue&quot; is a waltz that depicts a journey through a fantasy world. It was named by Roma Ryan, as the melody that Enya had come up with reminded her of the Caribbean. In writing about the song in 2002, Roma wrote: &quot;As with all dreams we reach for the ideal and &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot; represents such a dream. The lyrics can be summed up in three words, Believe in yourself.&quot;

Enya believed &quot;How Can I Keep from Singing?&quot; was a traditional Christian hymn from the Shaker sect. She chose to record her own rendition of it as she liked its melody and &quot;very strong&quot; lyrics. She added, &quot;They talked about the trouble in the world, the strife, the turmoil, but at the end of each verse it simply said &quot;how can I keep from singing?&quot; ... I believe this in music ... at some stage you&#x27;ve got to try and forget the trouble that is around you&quot;.
Enya and her record company were sued for copyright infringement by Sanga Music, Inc. for recording the song because she had mistakenly credited this track as a &quot;traditional Shaker hymn&quot;, thus assumed it as public domain. Pete Seeger had helped make the song fairly well known in the 1950s by publishing it with Doris Plenn&#x27;s additional third verse in his folk music magazine Sing Out! (Vol. 7, No 1. 1957), recording it, and mistakenly credited it as a &quot;traditional Quaker hymn&quot; without copyrighting Plenn&#x27;s verse, thus presenting the entire song as &quot;public domain&quot;. It was again published by Sanga Music, Inc. in 1964. Seeger had presented the new verse as being public domain and Plenn had only wanted the song to be preserved rather than seeking to make a profit from it, so the court decided that Enya could use the verse without paying royalties.
&quot;Ebudæ&quot; is an ancient name of the Hebrides islands in western Scotland. The word was previously referenced in &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;, specifically in the lyric &quot;From the north to the south, Ebudae into Khartoum&quot;. The song is composed of wordless mouth sounds that resemble Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Its story was inspired by the tradition of Scottish waulking songs sung by women as they fulled cloth.

&quot;No Holly for Miss Quinn&quot; is a piano instrumental named after a novel by Miss Read. It follows its partner piece, &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from &quot;Watermark&quot;, also named after one of her stories.

=== Side two ===
Enya drew inspiration for &quot;Book of Days&quot; from her own personal diary, something which Roma suggested as she knew Enya enjoyed keeping one. Please note that the 1st version aund in Gaelic on 1991 album lasts 2:34 and the later English/Gaelic version lasts 2:55 as listed nelow. The song was adapted from its original form as an instrumental track for the soundtrack to the 1992 romantic film &quot;Far and Away&quot;, with Roma writing a set of lyrics based on the film&#x27;s themes. The song features Irish lyrics that describe the excitement of writing in the diary in the morning, &quot;because you don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going to happen ... it&#x27;s the expectation of that day really that she was talking about&quot;.

&quot;Evacuee&quot; was written after she and Roma had seen a BBC documentary about a child evacuated from London during World War II and her subsequent reunion with her parents. A girl who was crying while recounting the story of her separation from, and return to, her home had moved them greatly. After Enya had written a melody for the song, the two imagined the scenario of the girl saying goodbye at the train station, &quot;waiting until it&#x27;s all over&quot;.

&quot;Lothlórien&quot; is an instrumental in reference to the Elvish kingdom mentioned in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; novels and adaptations.

The album&#x27;s second traditional song, &quot;Marble Halls&quot;, is an aria from the 1843 opera &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot; by Irish composer Michael William Balfe. Enya felt a sense of challenge when she recorded the latter as it had only been previously sung in an opera setting. For Nicky, it was necessary to incorporate reverb in the song as its title suggested to him that the listener should feel as if they are within a hall itself.

&quot;Afer Ventus&quot; is Latin for &quot;African Wind&quot;. Roma was inspired to name the track by listening to its sound and structure with the melody lines constantly &quot;sweeping in between each other&quot;, which created a wind-like effect.

&quot;Smaointe...&quot;, roughly translated from Irish as &quot;Thoughts...&quot;, was originally released as a B-side to the 7&quot; single of &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; as &quot;Smaoitím... (D&#x27; Aodh Agus Do Mháire Uí Dhúgain)&quot;, released in 1988. The song refers to the story of a large tsunami destroying the church, and everyone inside, at Magheragallon Beach in Gweedore, where Enya&#x27;s grandparents are buried. The theme of loss, something that Enya depicted in &quot;Watermark&quot; and &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, stemmed from her leaving home at age eleven to attend a strict boarding school, which she described as &quot;devastating&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; was released on 4 November 1991 in the United Kingdom; its release in the United States followed on 19 November 1991 by Reprise Records. A promotional box set containing a CD and cassette of the album, plus a 14-page booklet autographed by Roma with her words on each track and lyrics, was released and limited to 1,000 copies.

The album became a greater chart success than &quot;Watermark&quot;, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart for one week for the week ending on 16 November 1991. It spent a total of 110 weeks on the chart. In the United States, it entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number forty-seven, the week of 7 December 1991. It then rose to its peak at seventeen on the week ending 28 March 1992. It was present on the chart for a total of 238 weeks. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Age Albums chart, the album was number one for twenty-nine weeks during its 266-week stay.

In its first week of release, the album sold over 250,000 copies in the United States, and became Warner Bros. Records&#x27; top selling album in early 1992. This commercial success spread across Enya&#x27;s catalogue; three months after &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, an additional 250,000 copies of &quot;Watermark&quot; were sold in the same country. By July 1994, seven million copies of &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; had been sold worldwide. It sold close to one million copies in the United States each year from 1992 to 1996; in March 1996, it was certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of five million copies. In January 1997, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipment of 1.2 million copies. By 1994, the album spent 52 weeks on spanish charts and sold nearly 400,000 copies in Spain. The album has sold an estimated 13 million copies worldwide.

Between 1991 and 1994, Enya released four singles from &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;. &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot; was the lead single, released in November 1991. It peaked on the singles chart in the United Kingdom at thirteen, and received some crossover airplay exposure on alternative rock radio stations in the United States. &quot;How Can I Keep from Singing?&quot; was also released in 1991 and features two previously unreleased B-sides: &quot;Oíche Chiúin (Silent Night)&quot;, the Irish language version of the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night&quot; recorded in 1988, and &quot;&#x27;S Fágaim Mo Bhaile&quot;, an original composition recorded in 1991. In July 1992, &quot;Book of Days&quot; was released as the third single and peaked at number ten in the United Kingdom. &quot;Marble Halls&quot; followed in 1994 following its inclusion in the 1993 film &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;.

On 4 November 2021, the 30th anniversary of the release of &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, a live &quot;watch party&quot; video was broadcast on Enya&#x27;s YouTube channel. The video featured the album played in its entirety, with poems by Roman Ryan and commentary on each track.

== Reception ==
&quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, reviewer Mike Joyce praised Enya&#x27;s vocals as &quot;impressive&quot; and &quot;crystalline&quot; that bring &quot;unmistakable poignancy to much of the album&quot;. However, the tracks that focus on her piano playing, like &quot;No Holly for Miss Quinn&quot; and &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, make the album &quot;succumb to the usual new age doldrums&quot;. Barbara Jaeger gave a positive review for &quot;The Record&quot;. The three-year gap between &quot;Watermark&quot; and &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, she wrote, was &quot;worth it&quot; as the album, like its predecessor, contains &quot;rich sonic tapestries that envelop the listener&quot; that brings a &quot;lush, semi-New Age instrumental atmosphere&quot; that is &quot;only part of the inviting package&quot;. She picks &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot; as highlight tracks along with her singing in Irish. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Ned Raggett acknowledged similarities to &quot;Watermark&quot;, while also opining that &quot;in terms of finding her own vision and sticking with it&quot;, Enya &quot;polished and refined her work to a strong, elegant degree&quot; on &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;.

In 1993, Enya was awarded a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album for &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;. She also won an IFPI Platinum European Award, a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award, and a National Association of Recording Merchandisers Award for Best Selling Album. Saxophonist Colin Stetson credited &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; as an influence on his album &quot;All This I Do for Glory&quot; (2017). He said the Enya album &quot;made me think about how the air is manipulated in my own music.&quot;

<text>The of guided-missile destroyers in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force are equipped with the Aegis Combat System, and is the first of few ship classes outside the United States to have that capability. Following a decision made in December 2003, Japan is upgrading their &quot;Kongo&quot;-class destroyers with Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. The upgrade involves a series of installations and flight tests to take place from 2007 to 2010. JS &quot;Kongo&quot; was the first ship to have the BMD upgrade installed.

== Background ==
The JMSDF built under FY1960 program and started shipboard operation of surface-to-air missiles. She had been equipped with analog-version of the Tartar Guided Missile Fire Control System. A fully-digitized system was adopted on the next-generation , and later a combat direction system based on the Naval Tactical Data System was added.

Nevertheless, the JMSDF estimated that its fleets would not survive against Soviet airstrikes, especially Tupolev Tu-22M bombers using AS-4 air-to-surface missiles. Based on these estimates, JMSDF began to pursue the introduction of the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) from the early 1980s. In 1984, with the prospect of deploying AWS, concrete implementation plans began. And the construction of Japanese first Aegis-equipped ships, &quot;Kongo&quot; class, had begun under the FY1988 program.

== Design ==
The overall design is generally modeled on the s of the U.S. Navy. The hull adopted shelter deck design as with preceding Japanese destroyers, but it was widened to support the superstructure with four PESA antennas just as &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class. Due to this widened hull, the outer panel is inclined to reduce the width of the waterline, which also has the effect of reducing radar cross section area.

Because they are built to different operational requirements than the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers, such as for carrying extra commanding equipment, the &quot;Kongō&quot;-class ships&#x27; internal arrangement is quite different from the original design on which they are based. Recognisable external features are the vertical mast and enlarged superstructure to carry sufficient headquarters equipment so that they could act as a flagship.

The propulsion systems are almost the same as those of the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class, powered by four Ishikawajima-Harima LM2500 gas turbines giving them a top speed of .
== Equipment ==
The class is equipped with the Aegis Weapon System (AWS). The system version was Baseline 4 for name-ship through the third ship, and Baseline 5 for fourth ships immediately after they were put into service; then all ships were updated to Baseline 5.3 with modernization. The class uses the AN/SPY-1D as the main radar. As surface-to-air missiles, the SM-2MR Block IIIA was initially used, and later the Block IIIB came into use. Since the mid-2000s, they have also been equipped with a missile defense capability with the primary intention of countering North Korean ballistic missiles, and now have an Aegis BMD 3.6 system installed to launch SM-3 Block IA and IB missiles. 

The Mark 41 Vertical Launching System arrangement, similar to the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class, consisted of 29 cells on the foredeck and 61 cells on the afterdeck. These cells contain not only RIM-162, SM-2, and SM-3, but also VL-ASROCs. In addition, they are equipped with HOS-302, one of the Japanese variant of the Mark 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes, as anti-submarine weapons and Harpoon as anti-ship missiles. And as gunnery weapons, an Oto Melara /54 caliber gun and two Mark 15 20 mm CIWS gun mounts are installed.

Most of electronic devices outside of AWS originated in Japan. For electronic warfare, this class is equipped with NOLQ-2, an elaborate system capable of both ES and EA. The OQS-102 sonar is equivalent to the U.S. SQS-53C.

=== Flight tests for Aegis BMD systems ===

In December 2007, Japan conducted a successful test of the SM-3 block IA against a ballistic missile aboard . This was the first time a Japanese ship was selected to launch the interceptor missile during a test of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. In previous tests, they provided tracking and communications. Afterward, Japan has also undertaken another two successful Ballistic Missile Defense tests aboard in October 2009 and aboard in October 2010, while one test aboard in November 2008 failed to intercept the target.

== Names ==
The &quot;Kongō&quot;-class destroyers are named after mountains in Japan.

<doc id="997107" wikidata="Q311269" url="?curid=997107" title="John Bolton">
<text>John Robert Bolton (born November 20, 1948) is an American attorney, diplomat, Republican consultant, and political commentator. He served as the 25th United States ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006, and as the 26th United States national security advisor from 2018 to 2019.

Bolton served as a United States assistant attorney general for President Ronald Reagan from 1985 to 1989. He served in the State Department as the assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs from 1989 to 1993, and the under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs from 2001 to 2005. He was an advocate of the Iraq War as a Director of the Project for the New American Century, which favored going to war with Iraq.

He was the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from August 2005 to December 2006, as a recess appointee by President George W. Bush. He stepped down at the end of his recess appointment in December 2006 because he was unlikely to win confirmation in the Senate, of which the Democratic Party had control at the time. Bolton later served as National Security Advisor to President Donald Trump from April 2018 to September 2019. He repeatedly called for the termination of the Iran nuclear deal, from which the U.S. withdrew in May 2018. He wrote a best-selling book about his tenure in the Trump administration, &quot;The Room Where It Happened&quot;, published in 2020.

Bolton is widely considered a foreign policy hawk and advocates military action and regime change by the U.S. in Iran, Syria, Libya, Venezuela, Cuba, Yemen, and North Korea. A member of the Republican Party, his political views have been described as American nationalist, conservative, and neoconservative, although Bolton rejects the last term. He is a former senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and a Fox News Channel commentator. He was a foreign policy adviser to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Bolton was born on November 20, 1948, in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Virginia Clara &quot;Ginny&quot; (née Godfrey), a housewife, and Edward Jackson &quot;Jack&quot; Bolton, a Baltimore fireman. He grew up in the working-class neighborhood of Yale Heights, and won a scholarship to the McDonogh School in Owings Mills, Maryland, graduating in 1966. He also ran the school&#x27;s Students For Goldwater campaign in 1964.

Bolton attended Yale College, earning a Bachelor of Arts and graduating &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1970. He was a member of the Yale Political Union. He attended Yale Law School from 1971 to 1974, where he shared classes and student housing with his friend Clarence Thomas, earning a Juris Doctor in 1974.

In 1972, Bolton was a summer intern for Vice President Spiro Agnew. He was hired for the position by David Keene.

===Vietnam War===
Bolton was a supporter of the Vietnam War, but avoided combat through a student deferment followed by enlistment in the Maryland Air National Guard. During the 1969 Vietnam War draft lottery, Bolton drew number 185. (Draft numbers were assigned by birth date. Numbers 1 to 195 were eventually called up.) As a result of the Johnson and Nixon administrations&#x27; decisions to rely largely on the draft rather than on the reserve forces, joining a Guard or Reserve unit became a way to reduce the chances of service in Vietnam. 

Before graduating from Yale College in 1970, Bolton enlisted in the Maryland Army National Guard rather than waiting to find out if his draft number would be called. He attended Active Duty for Training (ADT) at Fort Polk, Louisiana, from July to November 1970. After serving in the National Guard for four years, he served in the United States Army Reserve until the end of his enlistment two years later.

He wrote in his Yale 25th reunion book: &quot;I confess I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy. I considered the war in Vietnam already lost.&quot; In a 2007 interview, Bolton explained his comment in the reunion book saying his decision to avoid service in Vietnam was because &quot;by the time I was about to graduate in 1970, it was clear to me that opponents of the Vietnam War had made it certain we could not prevail, and that I had no great interest in going there to have Teddy Kennedy give it back to the people I might die to take it away from.&quot; 

In his 2007 book, &quot;Surrender Is Not an Option&quot;, Bolton described his perception of the war as a &quot;futile struggle&quot;, and that &quot;dying for your country was one thing, but dying to gain territory that antiwar forces in Congress would simply return to the enemy seemed ludicrous to me. Looking back, I am not terribly proud of this calculation...&quot;

=== Attorney ===
From 1974 to 1981, Bolton was an associate at the Washington, D.C. office of Covington &amp; Burling; he returned to the firm again from 1983 to 1985. Bolton was also a partner in the law firm of Lerner, Reed, Bolton &amp; McManus, from 1993 to 1999. He was of counsel in the Washington, D.C. office of Kirkland &amp; Ellis from 2008 until his appointment as National Security Advisor in 2018. In September 2015, Freedom Capital Investment Management appointed Bolton as a senior advisor.

=== Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations ===
During the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, his governmental roles were within the State Department, the Justice Department, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. He was a protégé of conservative North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms.

His Justice Department position as an assistant attorney general required him to advance Reagan administration positions, including opposition to financial reparations to Japanese-Americans held in World War II-era internment camps; the insistence on Reagan&#x27;s executive privilege during William Rehnquist&#x27;s chief justice confirmation hearings, when Congress asked for memos written by Rehnquist as a Nixon Justice Department official; shepherding the judicial nomination process for Antonin Scalia; and the framing of a bill to control illegal immigration as an essential drug war measure. He was also involved in the Iran–Contra affair.

Bolton&#x27;s government service included positions such as:
* Assistant secretary for International Organization Affairs at the Department of State (1989–1993);
* Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division (1988–1989);
*Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs, Department of Justice (1985–1988);
*Assistant administrator for program and policy coordination, USAID (1982–1983); and
*General counsel, USAID (1981–1982). While working for USAID, Lynne Finney, a legal adviser for the agency, alleged that Bolton threatened to fire her for refusing to lobby for the deregulation of baby formula in developing nations.

==Under Secretary of State (2001–2005)==

Bolton worked as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, sworn into this position on May 11, 2001. In this role, a key area of his responsibility was the prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Bolton negotiated so-called &quot;Article 98&quot; agreements with countries to prohibit them from turning Americans over to the International Criminal Court, which is not recognized by the U.S. Bolton said the decision to pull out of the ICC was the &quot;happiest moment&quot; of his political career to date.

===Weapons of mass destruction===
Bolton was instrumental in derailing a 2001 biological weapons conference in Geneva convened to endorse a UN proposal to enforce the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. He argued that the plan would have jeopardized U.S. national security by allowing spot inspections of suspected U.S. weapons sites.

In May 2002, Bolton gave a speech entitled &quot;Beyond the Axis of Evil&quot; in response to President Bush&#x27;s State of the Union Address (where Bush characterized Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as part of an &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;). Bolton added three more nations to be grouped with the aforementioned rogue states: Cuba, Libya, and Syria. Bolton said they were all &quot;state sponsors of terrorism that are pursuing or who have the potential to pursue weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or have the capability to do so in violation of their treaty obligations.&quot; During his time as Under Secretary of State, Bolton &quot;sought to block, and often succeeded in sabotaging&quot; the negotiations that Secretary of State Colin Powell had conducted with North Korea.

Also in 2002, Bolton is said to have flown to Europe to demand the resignation of Brazilian José Bustani, head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and to have orchestrated his removal at a special session of the organization. Bustani was deemed to be an obstacle in creating the case for the invasion of Iraq. The United Nations&#x27; highest administrative tribunal later condemned the action as an &quot;unacceptable violation&quot; of principles protecting international civil servants. Bustani had been unanimously re-elected for a four-year term—with strong U.S. support—in May 2000, and in 2001 was praised for his leadership by Colin Powell. According to Bustani, John Bolton demanded that he step down in 24 hours, adding, &quot;We know where your children are.&quot;

He also pushed for reduced funding for the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program to halt the proliferation of nuclear materials. At the same time, he was involved in the implementation of the Proliferation Security Initiative, working with a number of countries to intercept the trafficking in weapons of mass destruction and in materials for use in building nuclear weapons.

===Diplomacy===
According to an article in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Bolton was highly successful in pushing his agenda, but his bluntness made him many enemies. &quot;Iran&#x27;s Foreign Ministry has called Bolton &#x27;rude&#x27; and &#x27;undiplomatic&#x27;.&quot; In response to critics, Bolton says his record &quot;demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy.&quot; Bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position. &quot;It&#x27;s like the Palestinians&#x27; having to negotiate with [Israeli Prime Minister] Ariel Sharon. If you have a deal, you know you have a deal,&quot; an anonymous official told CNN. He also &quot;won widespread praise for his work establishing the Proliferation Security Initiative, a voluntary agreement supported (at the time) by 60 countries&quot;.

===Interventions===
In July 2022, during an interview with CNN reporter Jake Tapper, denying that President Donald Trump&#x27;s involvement in the 
January 6 United States Capitol attack amounted to an attempt to overthrow the U.S. government, Bolton admitted to his personal involvement in planning unspecified &quot;coups d&#x27;état&quot; in foreign countries.

According to Reuters, &quot;it is highly unusual for U.S. officials to openly acknowledge their role in stoking unrest in foreign countries.&quot;

===Unsubstantiated claims about a Cuban WMD program===
In 2002, Bolton delivered a speech at the Heritage Foundation where he accused Cuba of having a secret biological weapons program, and of collaborating with Libya and Iran. Bolton asserted, &quot;The United States believes that Cuba has at least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development effort. Cuba has provided dual-use biotechnology to other rogue states.&quot; Bolton made the remarks a week before former President Jimmy Carter was scheduled to meet Fidel Castro in Cuba, becoming the first U.S. president since the Cuban Revolution to visit Cuba in an effort to build bridges between the two countries.

The State Department&#x27;s chief bioweapons analyst refused to approve the accusation made in the speech, telling Bolton that the State Department did not have evidence to substantiate Bolton&#x27;s accusation. Subsequently, Bolton berated the analyst, unsuccessfully sought to fire him, began to exclude the analyst&#x27;s supervisor from meetings, and tried to transfer the analyst to a different office. Bolton was also alleged to have sought to punish other intelligence officers who refused to endorse his claims about Cuba. 

Paul Pillar described Bolton&#x27;s attempts to get the intelligence community to endorse his views as among the most egregious recent instances of &quot;arm-twisting&quot; the intelligence community, while Columbia University international relations scholar Richard K. Betts described the reports about Bolton&#x27;s pressure as &quot;most blatant top-down pressure on intelligence&quot; in the Bush administration. Bolton claims the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers, who did not work under him, behaved unprofessionally.

In April 2004, Bolton again accused Cuba of being a &quot;terrorist and (biological weapons) threat to the United States.&quot; Experts at the time disputed the veracity of Bolton&#x27;s claims, saying the evidence in support of the claim was weak. In September 2004 and in the wake of the failure to locate WMDs in Iraq, the Bush administration backed off claims that Cuba had an active biological weapons program.

===Criticism===
Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman alleged that Bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of the statement that British Intelligence had determined Iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from Niger in Bush&#x27;s 2003 State of the Union Address. These statements were claimed by critics of the President to be partly based on documents found to be forged. Waxman&#x27;s allegations could not be confirmed, as they were based on classified documents.

Bolton stated in June 2004 congressional testimony that Iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination: &quot;Another unmistakable indicator of Iran&#x27;s intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to ... the IAEA ... when evidence of uranium enriched to 36 percent was found, it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts.&quot; However, later isotope analysis supported Iran&#x27;s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium. At their August 2005 meeting the IAEA&#x27;s Board of Governors concluded: &quot;Based on the information currently available to the Agency, the results of that analysis tend, on balance, to support Iran&#x27;s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed HEU [highly enriched uranium] contamination.&quot;

Bolton has often been accused of attempting to pressure the intelligence community to endorse his views. According to former coworkers, Bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from Secretary of State Colin Powell on multiple occasions, and from Powell&#x27;s successor Condoleezza Rice on at least one occasion.

==Ambassador to the United Nations (2005–2006)==
On March 7, 2005, Bolton was nominated to the post of United States Ambassador to the United Nations by President George W. Bush. 
Bolton said previously at a forum that &quot;there is no such thing as the United Nations&quot; and &quot;[i]f the U.N. secretary building in New York lost 10 stories, it wouldn&#x27;t make a bit of difference&quot;. Several officials from U.N. Security Council member states were shocked that Bush would nominate someone they believed had a known antipathy toward the United Nations. As a result of a Democratic filibuster, he was recess-appointed to the post on August 1, 2005. Bolton&#x27;s nomination received strong support from Republicans but faced heavy opposition from Democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the United Nations.

Holding a 10–8 majority in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees), the Republican leadership hoped to send Bolton&#x27;s nomination to the full Senate with a positive recommendation. Concern among some Republicans on the committee, however, prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation. In the full Senate, Republican support for the nomination remained uncertain, with the most vocal Republican critic, Ohio Senator George V. Voinovich, circulating a letter urging his Republican colleagues to oppose the nomination. 

Democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature, given the resistance of the White House to share classified documents related to Bolton&#x27;s alleged actions. The Republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate, but because a supermajority of 60 votes is needed to end debate, the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a 55–44 majority in the body. An earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the Democrats to relate only to judicial nominees, not ambassadorships, although the leader of the effort, Sen. John McCain, said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees.

On November 9, 2006, Bush, only days after losing both houses to a Democratic majority, sent the nomination for Bolton to continue as representative for the United States at the UN. He said: &quot;I believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences. And I believe we will be able to work through differences. I reassured the House and Senate leaders that I intend to work with the new Congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country.&quot;

===2005 nomination, Senate confirmation hearings===
On April 11, 2005, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee reviewed Bolton&#x27;s qualifications. Bolton said he and his colleagues &quot;view the U.N. as an important component of our diplomacy&quot; and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths, echoing Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&#x27;s words from a month earlier.

On the first day of the hearings, Republican committee chairman Richard Lugar criticized Bolton for ignoring the &quot;policy consequences&quot; of his statements, saying diplomatic speech &quot;should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the U.S. public opinion or to validate a personal point of view.&quot; The committee&#x27;s top Democrat, Joe Biden, compared sending Bolton to the UN to sending a &quot;bull into a china shop,&quot; and expressed &quot;grave concern&quot; about Bolton&#x27;s &quot;diplomatic temperament&quot; and his record: &quot;In my judgment, your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful,&quot; Biden said. Republican Senator George Allen said Bolton had the &quot;experience,&quot; &quot;knowledge,&quot; &quot;background,&quot; &quot;and the right principles to come into the United Nations at this time,&quot; calling him &quot;the absolute perfect person for the job.&quot; Democratic Senator Russ Feingold asked Bolton about what he would have done had the Rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the United Nations, and criticized his answer—which focused on logistics—as &quot;amazingly passive.&quot;

On the second day, April 12, 2005, the Senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that Bolton pressured intelligence analysts. Calling Bolton a &quot;serial abuser&quot;, former State Department intelligence chief Carl W. Ford Jr. said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen anybody quite like Secretary Bolton... I don&#x27;t have a second, third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people.&quot; Ford contradicted Bolton&#x27;s earlier testimony, saying: &quot;I had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done.&quot; Ford also characterized Bolton as a &quot;kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy&quot;, implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him, while having very little regard for people working under him.

Lugar, who criticized Bolton at his April 11 hearing, said the &quot;paramount issue&quot; was supporting Bush&#x27;s nominee. He conceded that &quot;bluntness... may be required&quot;, even though it is not &quot;very good diplomacy&quot;. Lincoln Chafee, the key member for Bolton&#x27;s approval, said &quot;the bar is very high&quot; for rejecting the president&#x27;s nominees, suggesting that Bolton would make it to the Senate.

On April 19, Democrats, with support from Voinovich, forced Lugar to delay the committee vote on Bolton&#x27;s nomination until May. The debate concerning his nomination raged in the Senate prior to the Memorial Day recess. Two other Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee, Chafee and Chuck Hagel, also expressed serious concerns about the Bolton nomination. Asked on April 20 if he was now less inclined to support the nomination, Chafee said, &quot;That would be accurate.&quot; He elaborated that Bolton&#x27;s prospects were &quot;hard to predict&quot; but said he expected that &quot;the administration is really going to put some pressure on Senator Voinovich. Then it comes to the rest of us [who] have had some reservations.&quot;

On April 20, it emerged that Melody Townsel, a former USAID contractor, had reported to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in Moscow. Townsel&#x27;s encounter with Bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for USAID, IBTCI. Townsel told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff that Bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight, among other workplace improprieties. In an official interview with Senate Foreign Relation Committee staff, Townsel detailed her accusations against Bolton, which were confirmed by Canadian designer Uno Ramat, who had served as an IBTCI employee and one of Townsel&#x27;s AID colleagues. &quot;Time&quot; magazine, among other publications, verified Townsel&#x27;s accusations and Ramat&#x27;s supporting testimony, and Townsel&#x27;s story was transcribed and entered into the official Senate committee record. Townsel, who was an employee of Young &amp; Rubicam at the time of her encounter with Bolton, continued working for the company on a variety of other USAID projects.

On April 22, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other media reported that Bolton&#x27;s former boss, Colin Powell, personally opposed the nomination and had been in personal contact with Chafee and Hagel. The same day, Reuters reported that a spokesman for Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) had said the Senator felt the committee &quot;did the right thing delaying the vote on Bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee.&quot;

Also on May 11, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported allegations that the American position at the 7th Review Conference in May 2005 of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty had been undercut by Bolton&#x27;s &quot;absence without leave&quot; during the nomination fight, quoting anonymous sources &quot;close to the negotiations&quot;.

===Democrats&#x27; filibuster===
On May 26, 2005, Senate Democrats postponed the vote on Bolton&#x27;s UN nomination. The Republican leadership failed to gain enough support to pass a cloture motion on the floor debate over Bolton, and minority leader Harry Reid conceded the move signaled the &quot;first filibuster of the year.&quot; The Democrats claimed that key documents regarding Bolton and his career at the Department of State were being withheld by the Bush administration. Scott McClellan, White House press secretary, responded by saying, &quot;Just 72 hours after all the good will and bipartisanship (over a deal on judicial nominees), it&#x27;s disappointing to see the Democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach.&quot;

The failure of the Senate to end debate on Bolton&#x27;s nomination provided one surprise for some: Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tennessee) voted against cloture for procedural reasons, so he could bring up a cloture vote in the future. (Although Voinovich once spoke against confirming Bolton, he voted for cloture.) Senator John Thune (R-South Dakota) voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against Bolton in the up-or-down vote as a protest against the government&#x27;s plans to close a military base (Ellsworth) in his home state.

On June 20, 2005, the Senate voted again on cloture. The vote failed 54–38, six votes short of ending debate. That marked an increase of two &quot;no&quot; votes, including the defection of Voinovich, who switched his previous &quot;yes&quot; vote and urged President Bush to pick another nominee (Democrats Mark Pryor, Mary Landrieu and Ben Nelson voted to end debate both times). On June 21, Frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless, but later that day, following a lunch at the White House, changed his position, saying he would continue to push for an up-or-down vote. Voinovich later recanted his opposition and stated that if Bolton were renominated he would have supported the nomination.

===Accusations of false statement===
On July 28, 2005, it was revealed that a statement made by Bolton on forms submitted to the Senate was false. Bolton indicated that in the prior five years he had not been questioned in any investigation, but in fact he had been interviewed by the State Department&#x27;s Inspector General as part of an investigation into the sources of pre-war claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. After insisting for weeks that Bolton had testified truthfully on the form, the State Department reversed itself, saying Bolton had simply forgotten about the investigation.

===Recess appointment===
On August 1, 2005, Bush officially made a recess appointment of Bolton, installing him as Permanent U.S. Representative to the UN. A recess appointment lasts until the next session of Congress ends or until the individual is renominated and confirmed by the Senate. During the announcement, Bush said, &quot;This post is too important to leave vacant any longer, especially during a war and a vital debate about U.N. reform.&quot; Democrats criticized the appointment, and Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT) of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said Bolton would lack credibility in the U.N. because he lacked Senate confirmation. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed Mr. Bolton, but told reporters that the new ambassador should consult with others as the administration continued to press for changes at the United Nations.

===Term at the UN===
&quot;The Economist&quot; called Bolton &quot;the most controversial ambassador ever sent by America to the United Nations.&quot; Some colleagues in the UN appreciated the goals Bolton was trying to achieve, but not his abrasive style. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in its editorial &quot;The Shame of the United Nations&quot;, praised Bolton&#x27;s stance on &quot;reforming the disgraceful United Nations Human Rights Commission&quot;, saying &quot;John Bolton, is right; Secretary-General Kofi Annan is wrong.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; also said the commission at that time was composed of &quot;some of the world&#x27;s most abusive regimes&quot; who used their membership as cover to continue their abusiveness.

Bolton also opposed the proposed replacement for the Human Rights Commission, the UN Human Rights Council, as not going far enough for reform, saying: &quot;We want a butterfly. We don&#x27;t intend to put lipstick on a caterpillar and call it a success.&quot;

===2006 nomination===
Bush announced his intention to renominate Bolton for confirmation as U.N. ambassador at the beginning of 2006, and a new confirmation hearing was held on July 27, 2006, in the hope of completing the process before the expiration of Bolton&#x27;s recess appointment at the end of the 109th Congress. Voinovich, who had previously stood in opposition to Bolton, had amended his views and determined that Bolton was doing a &quot;good job&quot; as UN ambassador; in February 2006, he said &quot;I spend a lot of time with John on the phone. I think he is really working very constructively to move forward.&quot;

Over the summer and during the fall election campaign, no action was taken on the nomination because Chafee, who was in a difficult re-election campaign, blocked a Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote. Without his concurrence, the SFRC would have been deadlocked 9–9, and the nomination could not have gone to the Senate floor for a full vote. Bush formally resubmitted the nomination on November 9, 2006, immediately following a midterm election that would give control of the 110th Congress to the Democratic party. Chafee, who had just lost his re-election bid, issued a statement saying he would vote against recommending Bolton for a Senate vote, citing what he considered to be a mandate from the recent election results: &quot;On Tuesday, the American people sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with the foreign policy approach of the Bush administration. To confirm Mr. Bolton to the position of U.N. ambassador would fly in the face of the clear consensus of the country that a new direction is called for.&quot;

===Termination of service===
On December 4, 2006, Bolton announced that he would terminate his work as U.S. representative to the UN at the end of the recess appointment and would not continue to seek confirmation. His letter of resignation from the Bush administration was accepted on December 4, 2006, effective when his recess appointment ended December 9 at the formal adjournment of the 109th Congress.

The announcement was characterized as Bolton&#x27;s &quot;resignation&quot; by the Associated Press, United Press International, ABC News, and other news sources, as well as a White House press release and President Bush himself. The White House, however, later objected to the use of this language. Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino told CBS News &quot;it is not a resignation.&quot; The actual language of the President&#x27;s written acceptance was: &quot;It is with deep regret that I accept John Bolton&#x27;s decision to end his service in the administration as permanent representative of the United States to the United Nations when his commission expires.&quot; However, at a press conference, the President said, &quot;I received the resignation of Ambassador John Bolton. I accept it. I&#x27;m not happy about it. I think he deserved to be confirmed.&quot; Some news organizations subsequently altered their language to phrases such as &quot;to step down,&quot; &quot;to leave,&quot; or &quot;to exit.&quot;
===Support for Bolton===
During his confirmation hearings in 2005, letters with signatures of more than 64 co-workers and professional colleagues were sent to Senator Richard Lugar, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in praise of Bolton and contradicting other criticisms and allegations concerning his diplomatic style and his treatment of colleagues and staff.

In late 2006, when his nomination was again before the committee, another letter signed by professional colleagues supporting the renomination was sent to Senator Lugar. A &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op ed by Claudia Rosett on December 5, 2006, said in part, &quot;Bolton has been valiant in his efforts to clean up UN corruption and malfeasance, and follow UN procedure in dealing with such threats as a nuclear North Korea, a Hezbollah bid to take over Lebanon, and the nuclearization of Hezbollah&#x27;s terror-masters in Iran. But it has been like watching one man trying to move a tsunami of mud.&quot;

==National Security Advisor (2018–2019)==

===Speculation on position (2016–2017)===
In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump named Bolton as a possible choice for Secretary of State. Appearing on Fox News&#x27; Fox and Friends on December 1, 2016, Bolton admitted he was being considered as a Secretary of State candidate for the incoming Trump administration. Several Trump associates claim Bolton was not chosen, in part, due to Trump&#x27;s disdain for Bolton&#x27;s signature mustache.

The evening of December 10, the BBC cited NBC reports that &quot;sources close to Mr Trump [were]... saying that Mr Tillerson is likely to be named next week&quot; and that former UN ambassador John Bolton &quot;will serve as his deputy&quot;.

Bolton has supported theories about the health of Hillary Clinton and about her aide Huma Abedin, and in December 2016, Bolton said the conclusion of the United States Intelligence Community that Russian hackers had intervened to help elect Donald Trump in 2016 may have been a &quot;false flag&quot; operation. In a subsequent interview on Fox News, Bolton criticized the Obama administration&#x27;s retaliatory sanctions as insufficient and suggested that the US response should &quot;make them [the Russians] feel pain&quot;.

===Tenure===
In February 2017 President Trump interviewed Bolton and three others to determine who would fill the position of National Security Advisor vacated by Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn. The position ultimately went to H. R. McMaster. Trump &quot;made a point on Monday of praising Mr. Bolton and saying that he would find a position for him in his administration eventually.&quot; Bolton was seen at the White House on the evening of March 6, 2018, presumably to be interviewed as a candidate for national security adviser.
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on March 22, 2018, that John Bolton would replace National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, which was confirmed by Trump in a tweet later that day. Bolton began his position as National Security Advisor on April 9, 2018. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the rise of Bolton and Mike Pompeo, coupled with the departure of Rex Tillerson and General McMaster, meant Trump&#x27;s foreign policy team was now &quot;the most radically aggressive foreign policy team around the American president in modern memory&quot;, and compared it to the foreign policy team surrounding George W. Bush, notably with Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.

On April 10, 2018, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert resigned at Bolton&#x27;s request, and Bolton said he was considering a merger of the NSC with the Homeland Security Council. During his first week in office Bolton requested and obtained the resignations of multiple National Security Council (NSC) employees including NSC spokesman Michael Anton (April 8), deputy national security adviser Nadia Schadlow (April 10), and deputy national security adviser Ricky L. Waddell (April 12). CNN reported in September 2018 that Bolton had significantly shrunk the number of NSC personnel, cutting it to under 300.

In April 2018, Bolton pressed President Trump to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal, which Trump did a month later.

The Huffington Post reported that on May 8, 2018, Bolton removed Timothy Ziemer and dissolved his Global Health Security team formerly on the NSC leaving the administration&#x27;s high level preparation for and ability to respond to pandemics, infectious disease, and other biological threats unclear. The choice to remove and not replace Ziemer in the midst of an emerging Ebola outbreak in The Democratic Republic of Congo was criticized in several news outlets.
On September 10, 2018, in his first major address as National Security Advisor, Bolton criticized the International Criminal Court, saying it lacks checks and balances, exercises &quot;jurisdiction over crimes that have disputed and ambiguous definitions,&quot; and has failed to &quot;deter and punish atrocity crimes.&quot; Calling the ICC a threat to &quot;American sovereignty and U.S. national security,&quot; Bolton said it is &quot;superfluous,&quot; given that &quot;domestic judicial systems already hold American citizens to the highest legal and ethical standards.&quot; He added that the U.S. would do everything &quot;to protect our citizens&quot; should the ICC attempt to prosecute U.S. servicemen over alleged detainee abuse in Afghanistan, and it would bar ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the U.S. and sanction their funds. He also criticized Palestinian efforts to bring Israel before the ICC over allegations of human rights abuses in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
In 2018, Bolton requested that the Pentagon provide the White House with options for military strikes against Iran. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Bolton &quot;intensified the administration&#x27;s policy of isolating and pressuring Iran—reflecting an animus against Iran&#x27;s leaders that dates back to his days as an official in the George W. Bush administration. As a private citizen, he later called for military strikes on Iran, as well as regime change.&quot;

As National Security Advisor, Bolton eliminated the kinds of internal policy debates that his predecessor H. R. McMaster had in place. &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that this change in practices contributed to Trump&#x27;s sudden decision to withdraw the United States from Syria in January 2019.

As National Security Advisor, Bolton advanced policies skeptical and hostile toward international organizations. By his first year as National Security Advisor, Bolton had reshaped the National Security Council and become influential within the Trump Administration.

By May 2019, Trump had undercut some of Bolton&#x27;s major hard line positions, stating he was not seeking regime change in Iran and contradicting Bolton&#x27;s assertion that North Korea had recently violated United Nations resolutions by testing new short-range missiles. 
In late August 2019, Bolton met Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk, Belarus.

On September 10, 2019, President Trump claimed on Twitter that he had told Bolton on September 9 his &quot;services are no longer needed&quot; given &quot;many&quot; disagreements with Trump, thus Bolton gave his resignation on September 10. Just minutes later, Bolton contradicted Trump&#x27;s account, tweeting out this claim: Bolton offered to resign on September 9, with Trump replying: &quot;Let&#x27;s talk about it tomorrow.&quot; Bolton later told the media Trump &quot;never asked&quot; for his resignation &quot;directly or indirectly&quot;, and that he had both offered to resign and actually resigned of his own accord. Meanwhile, the White House endorsed Trump&#x27;s version of the events. Politico reported that Tucker Carlson had urged Trump to fire Bolton.

After Bolton&#x27;s departure, Trump claimed that Bolton&#x27;s views were &quot;not necessarily tougher&quot; than his own: &quot;in some cases, he thought it was too tough what we were doing&quot;. On Cuba and Venezuela, Trump claimed that his own views were &quot;far stronger&quot; than Bolton&#x27;s: &quot;He was holding me back!&quot; Bolton himself was known for his hawkish positions, including on Cuba and Venezuela, while Trump previously in May 2019 offered a different view of Bolton: &quot;I actually temper John, which is pretty amazing.&quot;

Following his departure, Bolton was reappointed as a senior advisor to investment company Rhône Group, a role he had held previously.

=== Trump–Ukraine scandal ===
Following Bolton&#x27;s departure, Fiona Hill, who served as the National Security Council&#x27;s senior director for Europe and Russia, testified before a Congressional committee that Bolton had disassociated himself from what he viewed as the Trump administration&#x27;s effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the President&#x27;s political rivals.

Bolton refused to attend his scheduled deposition in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump on November 7, 2019, and threatened to take legal action if he was subpoenaed. Bolton said he was willing to testify, but wanted a federal court to first rule on a lawsuit by his former deputy seeking a court ruling on the competing claims of the Trump administration and Congress. However, in a written statement obtained by NBC News on January 6, 2020, Bolton announced that he would testify during the Senate impeachment trial should he be issued a subpoena to do so. A 51-vote majority would be required from the Senate in order to obtain the subpoena. 

As the second week of opening statements was set to begin, to be followed by a vote on whether to call witnesses, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Bolton wrote in his forthcoming book that the President had told him in August 2019 that he wanted to continue freezing the Ukraine aid until officials there pursued investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. The &quot;Times&quot; also stated that &quot;Drafts of the book outline the potential testimony of the former national security adviser if he were called as a witness in the president&#x27;s impeachment trial.&quot; On January 23, as Bolton was preparing for possible Senate testimony about the assertions in his manuscript, the National Security Council informed him that it contained classified information and &quot;may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information.” Bolton&#x27;s attorney stated he did not believe the manuscript contained sensitive information. The dispute set the stage for a prolonged review, with Bolton&#x27;s attorney asking that access to the manuscript be limited to &quot;those career government officials and employees regularly charged with responsibility for such reviews.&quot; The leaked contents from the book also resulted in Trump impeachment lawyer Jay Sekulow dismissing Bolton&#x27;s claims as &quot;inadmissible&quot; when he argued before the Senate in defense of Trump on January 28, 2020. Democratic trial manager Adam Schiff later remarked that Sekulow&#x27;s assertion validated the argument that Bolton should be called to testify.

== Punditry and conservative activism ==

Bolton was executive director of the Committee on Resolutions in the Republican National Committee from 1983 to 1984.

Between 1997 and 2000, Bolton worked as an assistant to James Baker when he was the UN Secretary-General envoy to the Western Sahara. Since 2006, he has been a paid Fox News contributor and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. For 2017, he reported an income of $569,000 from Fox News. Bolton was a contributor to &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, an American conservative opinion magazine, from 1997 to 2000, and again from 2014 to 2016.
From 2013 until March 2018, Bolton was chairman Gatestone Institute. In 2018, the White House reported that Bolton&#x27;s total income for 2017 had been $2.2 million which included $569,000 from Fox News and $747,000 in speaking fees from, among others, the Victor Pinchuk Foundation (a Ukrainian NGO), Deutsche Bank, and HSBC.

=== 2012 presidential election ===
Bolton considered running for president in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. He received attention in conservative circles, including the cover of the December 31, 2010, issue of &quot;National Review&quot; magazine. He told &quot;Politico&quot;: &quot;As I survey the situation, I think the Republican field is wide open. I don&#x27;t think the party&#x27;s anywhere close to a decision. And stranger things have happened. For example, inexperienced senators from Illinois have gotten presidential nominations.&quot; In September 2011, Bolton said he would not run for president in 2012.

During the Republican primary, Republican presidential-hopeful Newt Gingrich said he would ask Bolton to serve as his Secretary of State. In January 2012, Bolton endorsed Mitt Romney for the 2012 Republican Nomination.

=== American Enterprise Institute ===
Bolton was senior vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, from 1997 to 2001. At the time, he frequently wrote columns criticizing the Clinton administration&#x27;s foreign policy. Bolton said Clinton&#x27;s policy on Iraq was &quot;worse than incompetent&quot;, his policy on North Korea was &quot;egregiously wrong&quot;, and his Libya policy was a &quot;catastrophic loss of U.S. credibility.&quot;

After leaving the George W. Bush Administration in 2006, Bolton returned to the American Enterprise Institute as a Senior Fellow. From 2010 until 2018, Bolton served as Director, Foreign and Defense Policy Studies for AEI. In Bolton&#x27;s time at the American Enterprise Institute, he spoke against the policy of rewarding North Korea for ending its nuclear weapons program. He said the policy would encourage others to violate nuclear non-proliferation rules so they could then be rewarded for following the rules they&#x27;d already agreed to.

In July 2013, Bolton was identified as a key member of Groundswell.

=== John Bolton Super PAC ===
In 2013, Bolton set up the John Bolton Super PAC. It raised $11.3 million for Republican candidates in the 2014 and 2016 elections and spent $5.6 million, paying Cambridge Analytica at least $650,000 for voter data analysis and digital video ad targeting in support of the campaigns of Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), and of former U.S. Senator (R-MA) Scott Brown&#x27;s unsuccessful 2014 bid for a U.S. Senate seat for New Hampshire. In September 2016, Bolton announced that his Super PAC would spend $1million on (R-N.C.) Senator Richard Burr&#x27;s reelection effort by targeting ads at &quot;social media users and Dish Network and Direct TV subscribers&quot;.

The Center for Public Integrity analysed the John Bolton Super PAC&#x27;s campaign finance filings and found that they had paid Cambridge Analytica more than $1.1 million since 2014 for &quot;research&quot; and &quot;survey research&quot;. According to Federal Election Commission filings, Cambridge Analytica was paid more than $811,000 by them in the 2016 presidential election; in the same election cycle, the Super PAC spent around $2.5 million in support of Republican U.S. Senate candidates.

Bolton said he aims to raise and spend $25 million for up to 90 Republican candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. In January 2018, Bolton announced a $1 million advertising campaign in support of Kevin Nicholson&#x27;s bid for the Republican nomination to run against incumbent Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. The Super PAC ran an ad campaign in the Green Bay area in January 2018; on March 19, 2018, the Super PAC announced a two-week $278,000 television and radio ad campaign in the Milwaukee area.

Major donors to the John Bolton Super PAC are Robert Mercer, who gave $4 million from 2012 to 2016; Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus, and Los Angeles real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer.

After Bolton was appointed National Security Advisor in March 2018, the John Bolton Super PAC and the John Bolton PAC announced that their political activities were suspended temporarily, effective March 31, 2018. The Super PAC&#x27;s FEC filings showed a balance of $2.6 million in unspent donations at the end of March 2018.

=== 2024 presidential election ===
Bolton had openly considered the idea of running for president in the 2024 United States presidential election in order to secure the Republican nomination against former President Donald Trump. However, he had been widely ridiculed for proposing running for president, due to bipartisan opposition to him and his policies.

==Memoir and legal concerns==
On June 16, 2020, the Trump Justice Department attempted to block publication of Bolton&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Room Where It Happened&quot;, seeking to confiscate Bolton&#x27;s $2 million advance for breach of contract, asserting he had not completed the prepublication security review as he had agreed to receive his security clearance. Bolton had submitted the book for security review in December 2019, and after months of discussions, was told on April 27 by Ellen Knight—the National Security Council&#x27;s senior director for prepublication review—that no other classification issues remained. However, the White House did not provide Bolton written notice that he could proceed with publication, and in May another NSC official was asked to further review the manuscript. On June 17, the Justice Department asked a federal judge to issue an injunction to block publication of the book, which had already been printed, bound and shipped to distribution warehouses for its official release the following week. By that day, media outlets had acquired copies of the book and begun publishing articles about its contents.

In its brief filed with the court, the Justice Department provided six examples of what it asserted were classified items that remained in the book. Trump had previously asserted that any conversation with him is &quot;highly classified.&quot; During a hearing on June 19, federal judge Royce Lamberth castigated Bolton for proceeding to publish his book without formal clearance, but ruled that publication of the book could proceed.

Bolton&#x27;s attorney asserted that the White House was slow-walking the review process to prevent the book, which contained extensive harsh criticism of Trump, from being released during the 2020 election campaign. According to reporting, Trump claimed that the book contained &quot;highly classified&quot; information but also characterized the book as &quot;pure fiction.&quot;

On June 21, a pirated copy of the book appeared online. The book was released on June 23. Later that summer, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into whether the book revealed classified information, empaneling a grand jury that subpoenaed the publisher&#x27;s communications records.

The Justice Department dropped its criminal inquiry of Bolton in June 2021 and moved to end efforts to confiscate proceeds from his book. In a 2023 edition of his memoirs, Bolton criticizes Trump as a man who punishes &quot;personal enemies and appease[s] adversaries Russia and China&quot;.

== Political positions ==


He declared himself in an interview with Edward Luce of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 2007 to be a &quot;Goldwater conservative&quot;, as opposed to being a neoconservative. He also pointed out that he was a follower of Edmund Burke. He also said &quot;I have always been a conservative. The idea of big-government conservatism has more neocon adherents than from unmodified conservatives.&quot;

=== Unilateralism and Americanism ===
Americanism is Bolton&#x27;s core belief, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
Bolton is skeptical of international organizations and international law, believing them to endanger American sovereignty, and does not believe they have legitimate authority under the U.S. Constitution. He criticized the Obama administration&#x27;s foreign policy for what he perceived as surrendering U.S. sovereignty. He also prefers unilateralism over multilateralism. In a 2000 article in the &quot;Chicago Journal of International Law&quot;, Bolton described himself as a &quot;convinced Americanist&quot;, favoring it over what he described as &quot;globalism&quot;. In his roles in the U.S. government, however, Bolton has been more pragmatic in his actions toward international organizations, though according to &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, he effectively advanced his views on this subject during his tenure in the Trump Administration.

Bolton has criticized the International Criminal Court, seeing it as a threat to U.S. sovereignty. Bolton said: &quot;If the court comes after us, Israel or other US allies, we will not sit quietly. We will ban its judges and prosecutors from entering the United States. We will sanction their funds in the US financial system, and we will prosecute them in the US criminal system.&quot;

====Views on the United Nations====
Bolton has been a strong critic of the United Nations for much of his career. Bolton&#x27;s opposition to the UN was rooted in a disdain for international organizations, which he believed infringed on the sovereignty of the United States. He also opposed the International Criminal Court. In 1994, he stated, &quot;There is no United Nations. There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that&#x27;s the United States, when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along.&quot;

He also stated that &quot;The Secretariat Building in New York has 38 stories. If you lost ten stories today, it wouldn&#x27;t make a bit of difference.&quot; When pressed on the statement during the confirmation process, he responded, &quot;There&#x27;s not a bureaucracy in the world that couldn&#x27;t be made leaner.&quot; However, in a paper on U.S. participation in the UN, Bolton stated &quot;the United Nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of American foreign policy.&quot;

=== European Union ===
Bolton is a critic of the European Union. In his book &quot;Surrender Is Not an Option&quot;, he criticized the EU for pursuing &quot;the endless process of diplomatic mastication&quot; rather than satisfactorily solving problems, and he labeled the organization&#x27;s diplomats as &quot;EUroids&quot;. He has also criticized the EU for advancing what he considers liberal policies. Bolton campaigned in Ireland against further EU integration in 2008, and he criticized the Treaty of Lisbon for expanding EU powers. In 2016, Bolton praised the UK&#x27;s referendum vote to leave the EU, and &quot;Axios&quot; reported in January 2019 that Bolton continued to advocate for a hard Brexit as National Security Advisor. In a March 2019 interview with Sky News, Bolton criticized the UK &quot;political class&quot; for not implementing the Brexit vote.
===Targeted killings of terrorist leaders===
In September 2011, when the Obama administration declared the death of Al Qaeda target and American-born radical Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, Bolton commented &quot;I think it&#x27;s important as individual Al Qaeda figures and other terrorists are killed that we not read more into it than there is. Consider this analogy if you were around in the 1920s and somebody said, my God, Vladimir Lenin is dead. The Bolsheviks will never recover from this...So while Al-Awlaki&#x27;s death is significant, I would not read cosmic consequences into it.&quot;

=== Libya ===
Bolton opposed the deal that George W. Bush made with then Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to eliminate the country&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction program. He was in a key role during initial negotiations but his role became limited over time. According to a 2005 study, Bolton was intentionally kept out of the loop so a final agreement could be reached: &quot;Bolton reportedly was unaware of the December 19 WMD agreement until very shortly before its public announcement. And after initially being given a lead role in implementing it, he pushed so hard to backtrack from the agreement that the British convinced the Bush administration to restrict his involvement in the Libya matter.&quot;

Bolton supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya that toppled the regime of Muammar Gaddafi.

=== Iraq ===
Bolton is regarded to be an &quot;architect&quot; of the Iraq War. In 1998, he was a signatory to a letter sent to President Bill Clinton urging him to remove Saddam Hussein from power using U.S. diplomatic, political and military power. He supported the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein and continued to stand by his support of the invasion by 2018. In 2007, Bolton said the only mistake the United States made with regard to Iraq was to not leave earlier after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and tell the Iraqis &quot;Here&#x27;s a copy of the Federalist Papers. Good luck.&quot;

In March 2023, Bolton defended the decision to invade Iraq, claiming that there were concerns that Saddam Hussein would pursue nuclear weapons and provide them to terrorist groups.

=== Kosovo ===
During 2008, Bolton opposed the declaration of independence by Kosovo. In 2018 he said, &quot;US policy is that if the two parties can work it out between themselves and reach agreement, we don&#x27;t exclude territorial adjustments,&quot; and that the US or Europe would not &quot;stand in the way if the two parties to the dispute reached a mutually satisfactory settlement.&quot;

=== Israel ===


Bolton is known for his strong support for Israel. Bolton opposes the two-state solution of creating an independent Palestinian state alongside the existing state of Israel. Bolton supported moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in accordance with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, and he testified in front of Congress in 2017 on the matter. In 2010, Bolton co-founded the Friends of Israel Initiative with 12 other international figures.

Bolton supports what he calls the &quot;Three State Solution&quot; in order to determine the political status of Gaza and the West Bank. Under Bolton&#x27;s Three State Solution, Israel would annex settlements it has built in the West Bank since the conclusion of the Six-Days War in 1967, Egypt would annex and administer the Gaza Strip, and Jordan would annex and administer the remaining portion of the West Bank not annexed by Israel. Bolton&#x27;s Three State proposal would not result in the creation of an independent Palestinian state.

Bolton opposed the 2023 Gaza war ceasefire. In December 2023, he proposed resettling Palestinians from Gaza. In April 2024, Bolton said that the Gaza war &quot;is an Iranian war against Israel, fought through terrorist proxies&quot;, and the only way to end the suffering of the people of Gaza &quot;is to eliminate Hamas, which is the cause of the suffering.&quot;

===North Korea and Iran===
Bolton has advocated for pre-emptive strikes against North Korea and Iran. In March 2018, he suggested that South Korea take North Korea and terminate the North Korean regime as the only &quot;diplomatic option&quot;, and said that the war between the two countries is their problem and not the United States&#x27; problem.

In 2006, Bolton attempted to bring prosecution against Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for incitement to genocide in the International Court of Justice, along with Alan Dershowitz, Dore Gold, and other experts from the United States, Canada, and Israel, based on Ahmadinejad&#x27;s comments that &quot;Israel must be wiped off the map&quot;.

In 2008, Bolton said: &quot;The idea here is not to have much larger hostilities, but to stop the Iranians from engaging in the hostilities that they&#x27;re already doing against us inside Iraq. And they&#x27;re doing much the same by aiding the Taliban in Afghanistan. So this is not provocative or preemptive, this is entirely responsive on our part.&quot; In 2018, Bolton stated: &quot;Russia, China, Syria, Iran, North Korea. These are regimes that make agreements and lie about them. A national security policy that is based on the faith that regimes like that will honor their commitments is doomed to failure.&quot; He also said, &quot;Our goal should be regime change in Iran.&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, described the people who have worked with Bolton as saying &quot;he is focused less on North Korea than on Iran&quot;. H. R. McMaster has reportedly told Dexter Fikins that Bolton has had &quot;[the] anal focus on Iran for twenty years&quot;.

Unlike several of President Trump&#x27;s early national security officials like National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Bolton campaigned to press President Trump for a complete withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran (the JCPOA) and rejected the idea it could be fixed. Unable at the time to directly present his position to President Trump, Bolton published his proposal on how to withdraw from the Iran deal in an August 28, 2017 National Review Online article. After he was named to succeed McMaster as Nation Security Adviser in April 2018, Bolton pressed the President to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, a decision President Trump announced a month later. Bolton has been one of the biggest anti-Iran hawks in the Trump administration.

Speaking to a meeting of Iranian exile group Mujahedin-e-Khalq in March 2018, Bolton said the Trump administration should follow the goal of regime change in Iran and that &quot;before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!&quot;

In 2019, Bolton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo successfully sabotaged Trump&#x27;s attempts to open diplomatic channels with Iran.

On January 3, 2020, the high-level Iranian General, Qasem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone strike, which considerably heightened the existing tensions between the two countries. In a tweet, Bolton called the airstrike a &quot;long in the making, this was a decisive blow against Iran&#x27;s malign Quds Force activities worldwide. Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran.&quot;

====People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran====
Prior to it being de-listed by the U.S. as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2012, Bolton spoke in favor of the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (also known as the Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK), MEK has opposed the Iranian theocratic state since shortly after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. According to his financial disclosure, he was given $40,000 for his 2016 speech to MEK. According to the 5 U.S.C. app. § 101-required &#x27;US Public Financial Disclosure Report&#x27; (2018) for Bolton, released by Al-Monitor, he has received $40,000 of speaking fee for &quot;Global Events–European Iranian Events&quot; on June 1, 2017, the same day he made a speech for the MEK in a gathering in Paris, France. In May 2018, Joanne Stocker, a journalist and researcher studying the MEK, told Richard Engel of MSNBC that she estimates Bolton was paid &quot;on the low-end, $180,000&quot;. Bolton&#x27;s office has refused to comment on the matter.

===Russia===

In 2013, after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden had been granted asylum in Russia, Bolton said: &quot;I think in order to focus Putin&#x27;s thinking, we need to do things that cause him pain as well. And while I know that not having a chance to have a bilateral meeting with his buddy Barack Obama will cause Putin to lose sleep, it&#x27;s not damaging Russian interests.&quot;

Russian Senator Aleksey Pushkov, former chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, said after Bolton&#x27;s appointment: &quot;Bolton, along with Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld, was an ardent supporter of the war in Iraq. A supporter of jihadists for the sake of overthrowing [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad]. A great specialist in interventions and aggression, and adept at the use of force. McMaster is a general. Bolton is the ideologue of a new cold war, a convinced opponent of Russia.&quot;

In a June 2017 article entitled &quot;Vladimir Putin looked Trump in the eye and lied to him. We negotiate with Russia at our peril,&quot; Bolton called Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections &quot;a true act of war.&quot; As Trump&#x27;s national security advisor in July 2018, Bolton referred to the investigation into the Russian interference as &quot;the Russia witch hunt&quot;.

In a December 2021 article entitled &quot;Now Is the Time for NATO to Stand Up to Russia,&quot; Bolton called for an aggressive response to Moscow&#x27;s troops build-up along the Ukraine border, before the full-scale invasion commenced in February 2022.

On July 6, 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden approved the provision of cluster munitions to Ukraine. Bolton hailed the decision as &quot;an excellent idea&quot;.

===China===
In 2018, Bolton criticized Washington&#x27;s One-China policy, under which Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, is not recognized as an independent nation, with recognition being given only to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

On China&#x27;s notoriety in intellectual property matters, he remarked in 2018 that &quot;There&#x27;s simply no excuse for the stealing of intellectual property, forced technology transfers it&#x27;s sometimes called.&quot;

Bolton said in October 2018 that the United States&#x27; need to counter a Chinese arms buildup in the Pacific, including within South China Sea, was one of the reasons for their move to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, because China is not a signatory to the treaty.

On January 20, 2021, the Chinese government imposed sanctions against Bolton and 27 other Trump administration officials that &quot;planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves, gravely interfered in China&#x27;s internal affairs, undermined China&#x27;s interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-U.S. relations&quot;. The sanctions ban them from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macau, and restrict companies and institutions associated with them from doing business in China.

===Latin America===
In a speech as National Security Advisor on November 1, 2018, Bolton praised Brazil&#x27;s president-elect Jair Bolsonaro and Colombia&#x27;s president Iván Duque Márquez, both right-wing conservatives, calling them &quot;like-minded&quot; partners. In the speech, he also framed Bolsonaro&#x27;s election victory as a &quot;positive sign&quot; for Latin America, and he criticized Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as a &quot;troika of tyranny.&quot;

===Criticism of the Obama administration===
In December 2012, Bolton suggested that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had faked a concussion to avoid testifying before Congress regarding the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Bolton stated &quot;When you don&#x27;t want to go to a meeting or conference or an event you have a &#x27;diplomatic illness&#x27;. And this is a diplomatic illness to beat the band.&quot;

In 2010, he wrote a foreword for the book &quot;The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration&#x27;s War on America&quot;, authored by far-right anti-Muslim commentators Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer. Bolton endorsed their book, writing: &quot;This book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of Barack Obama as our first post-American president. What it recounts is disturbing, and its broader implications are more disturbing still.&quot;

==Alleged assassination plot==
On August 10, 2022, an Iranian national and member of Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Shahram Poursafi, was charged by the United States Department of Justice in an October 2021 plot to allegedly murder Bolton, likely in retaliation for the January 2020 death of Qasem Soleimani. In response to the plot, Bolton was granted a protective detail from the United States Secret Service on the orders of President Joe Biden. This protection was later rescinded by President Trump upon his return to office on January 20, 2025.

==Personal life==
Bolton married Christina Bolton in 1972; they divorced in 1983. He has been married to Gretchen Smith Bolton, a financial planner with AXA Advisors, since January 1986. She was born in Kansas City in 1945 and had been married once before, divorcing in 1973. Together they have a daughter, Jennifer, and have resided in Bethesda, Maryland since 1986. Bolton is a Lutheran.

<text>Weisman Art Museum is an art museum at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Founded in 1934 as University Gallery, the museum was originally housed in an upper floor of the university&#x27;s Northrop Auditorium. In 1993, the museum moved to its current building, designed by the Canadian-born American architect Frank Gehry, and renamed in honor of art collector and philanthropist Frederick R. Weisman. Widely known as a &quot;modern art museum,&quot; its 20,000+ acquisitions include large collections of traditional Korean furniture and modern American Art, including collections of work by Marsden Hartley, Alfred Maurer, Charles Biederman.

==Frederick Rand Weisman==

Frederick Rand Weisman (April 27, 1912 – September 11, 1994) was a Minneapolis native who became well known as an art collector in Los Angeles. In 1982 Weisman purchased an estate in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles that would serve as a showcase for his personal collection of 20th-century art. When he opened the art collection to the public, he wanted to share the experience of &quot;living&quot; with art, rather than the usual, more formal protocol of seeing art in a gallery or museum. The estate remains the home of the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation to this day.

The Weisman Foundation estate is a two-story Mediterranean Revival house designed in the late 1920s by Los Angeles architect Gordon B. Kaufmann. The Weisman home exhibits the fine craftsmanship characteristic of the period, including custom decorative treatments on the walls and ceilings. Today the foundation estate, annex, and surrounding gardens are made accessible to the public by appointment only.

Another museum bearing Weisman&#x27;s name, the Frederick R. Weisman Museum of Art, is located on the campus of Pepperdine University in Malibu, California.

==Museum building==
The current museum building was designed by world-renowned architect Frank Gehry with MSR Design as architect of record and completed in November 1993. It is one of the major landmarks on the University of Minnesota campus, situated on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River at the east end of the Washington Avenue Bridge. The abstract structure is considered highly significant because it was built prior to the widespread use of computer aided design in architecture.

The building presents two faces, depending on which side it is viewed from. To the south and east, it presents a brick facade that blends with the historic buildings along Northrop Mall. To the north and west, it is an abstraction of a fish and waterfall in curving and angular brushed steel sheets. The stainless steel skin was fabricated and installed by the A. Zahner Company, a frequent collaborator with Gehry&#x27;s office.

The museum received a major addition, also designed by Frank Gehry, in 2011. HGA Architects and Engineers served as local consultants for the project.

<doc id="997115" wikidata="Q1088657" url="?curid=997115" title="The Memory of Trees">
<text>The Memory of Trees is the fourth studio album by Irish singer, songwriter, and musician Enya, released on 20 November 1995 by WEA. After travelling worldwide to promote her previous album &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; (1991), and contributing to film soundtracks, Enya took a short break before she started writing and recording a new album in 1993 with her longtime recording partners, arranger and producer Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. The album is Enya&#x27;s first to be recorded entirely in Ireland, and covers themes that include Irish and Druid mythology, the idea of one&#x27;s home, journeys, religion, dreams, and love. Enya continues to display her sound of multi-tracked vocals with keyboards and elements of Celtic and new age music, though Enya does not consider her music to be in the latter genre. She sings in English, Irish, Latin, and Spanish.

&quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; received mostly positive reviews from music critics. It became a worldwide commercial success, reaching number five in the United Kingdom and number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States. In 2000, it was certified multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling three million copies. Two tracks were released as singles; &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; in November 1995, which reached number seven in the United Kingdom, followed by &quot;On My Way Home&quot; in November 1996, which peaked at number twenty-six. Enya supported the album with a promotional tour that included several interviews and televised performances. &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; won Enya her second Grammy Award for Best New Age Album in 1997. It was remastered for a Japanese release with bonus tracks in 2009, and became available on vinyl in 2016.

==Recording and production==
After travelling worldwide since late 1991 to promote her previous album &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; (1991), and working for the soundtrack to the romantic adventure drama film &quot;Far and Away&quot; (1992), the 31-year-old Enya took a break from music that lasted for approximately one year. She spent most of the time with her family, trying &quot;to unwind&quot;, and visiting different places around the world to provide further inspiration for her songwriting. She returned to work in 1993 when she felt it was the right time to start writing and recording a new studio album with her longtime recording partners, arranger and producer Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. Enya received further soundtrack offers during the recording of &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, but turned them down as she wished to concentrate solely on the album.
During Enya&#x27;s break from music, the Ryans moved home from Artane, a northern suburb of Dublin, to Killiney, County Dublin, which involved the relocation of Aigle Studio, their home recording facility where Enya had recorded her previous three albums, &quot;Enya&quot; (1987), &quot;Watermark&quot; (1988), and &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;. Prior to the move, Enya and Nicky would start to record in Artane but were required to finish albums in London as Aigle lacked the right equipment to do so, which Enya found difficult as working in the city was met with frequent distractions and high studio rental costs, compared to the &quot;very intimate and personal&quot; setting at home. Aigle was rebuilt as a separate building on the grounds and upgraded with new equipment designed and built according to their specifications, thus making &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; Enya&#x27;s first to be recorded entirely in Ireland. She described the two-storey studio: &quot;It&#x27;s very peaceful and quiet. Upstairs we have this long room with two big arc windows at either end with a piano looking out over the Wicklow Mountains&quot;.

Enya&#x27;s pace and hours of working in the studio increased during the last eight months of recording, waking up at seven or eight in the morning and working until late in order to &quot;give as much as I could&quot; on the album. Enya later said she &quot;gave 100 per cent&quot; on it. When recording finished the album was mastered by Arun Chakraverty, who had also worked on the 1992 reissue of &quot;Enya&quot;, &quot;The Celts&quot;. Nicky was pleased to have the album complete due to the length of time it took to record. He reasoned this down to the three being &quot;the worst enemies in deciding when a piece is finished ... listener fatigue sets in and we&#x27;re unable to judge whether the work&#x27;s ready.&quot;

The album&#x27;s sleeve design was arranged to a layout by Sooky Choi who, like Chakraverty, had worked on &quot;The Celts&quot;. Its front is an adaptation of &quot;The Young King of the Black Isles&quot;, a painting by American artist Maxfield Parrish from 1906, itself based on the story of the same name from the collection of folktales, &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. Enya is depicted as the crying young king sitting on his throne in a costume designed by English fashion designer Elizabeth Emanuel. Live action footage of Enya in the costume and pose is used in the music video to &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
Enya is the sole composer of the music on &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; and co-arranged them with Nicky. It is her first album not to feature guest musicians. In addition to the vocals, piano and an array of keyboards and synthesisers that defined her sound, Enya plays the violin, cello, and percussion instruments. Her method of songwriting had deviated little since the start of her career, which started by entering the studio and forgetting about past successes. Ideas are then put on tape as either a vocal or a piano melody. &quot;Usually what happens is the first note, the second note, and it takes me on a journey and I just go along with it.&quot; When a collection of ideas have been recorded Enya presents them to Nicky, starting discussions on how to develop them further into songs. Roma will then work on a lyric if she feels the song would suit one.

As with her previous two albums, &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; opens with a same-titled instrumental with wordless vocals. The track originated from Roma after she read about Irish mythology and the Celtic druids, who placed a great importance on trees and believed they were sacred and possessed wisdom. Enya maintained it does not mean an ecological statement, but more about what trees may think about humans. Roma suggested its title and Enya agreed, thinking the title was particularly strong and has a sense of ambiguity that allows the listener to conjure up their own images and ideas when they see and hear it. When the title was agreed upon, Enya proceeded to write the song around two weeks later, which was an unusual way of working as the melody had always come first, followed by its title and lyrics.
&quot;Anywhere Is&quot; developed from a staccato line that Enya described had a &quot;march feel&quot;. Initially it was a track that she and Nicky wanted to reject for the album, but it was developed further after Rob Dickins, then chairman of Warner Music UK who had signed Enya, was invited to Ireland in August 1995 to listen to the album, roughly a year and a half into the recording process. Enya and the Ryans thought the songs needed further work but Dickens expressed his satisfaction, &quot;Most tracks sounded absolutely superb. They were ready.&quot; For &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, for which only its backing tracks had been put down, Dickins sensed the song had the makings of a hit single and encouraged them to complete it; it was the final track to be worked on. Enya&#x27;s melody for the song inspired Roma to write lyrics about, as &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine put it, &quot;the search for the temporal heaven all cultures call &#x27;home&#x27;&quot;, a subject that Enya felt was important as she only writes and rehearses her songs in Ireland. Dickins received a dedication on the album&#x27;s sleeve in Irish.

&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is Latin for &quot;Peace of the Gods&quot; and features Enya playing the cello and violin, instruments that she had not fully learnt but can play basic chords that to her sounded effective when Nicky layered them in the studio with her synthesisers. While working on the track in its early stages during the Christmas 1994 period, the song took a direction that Enya and Nicky were not happy with, so they left it for up to three months before they revisited it, readjusting its basic theme in the process. When Enya played the song to Roma, it was clear to them that the song suited a language other than English, and decided Latin, at Roma&#x27;s suggestion, for its &quot;classic feel&quot;. Regarding the Irish language song &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot;, which translates as &quot;Father in Heaven&quot; in English, Roma wrote &quot;The voice of epiphany is found in &#x27;Athair ar Neamh&#x27;. It is the voice of day, the voice of night, the voice of all, of understanding ... a peace which is unique to the individual, a peace that is felt rather than described&quot;.
&quot;From Where I Am&quot; is the album&#x27;s second of three instrumental tracks on the album. The title of &quot;China Roses&quot; makes reference to the flower &quot;Rosa chinensis&quot;. Its lyrics refer to the plants Christmas holly and Angel&#x27;s tears, the red-tailed comet, the Keys of Heaven, and the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; stories. Roma explained the song is based on the idea that &quot;everyone has their own idea of heaven ... it is a different treasure we embrace&quot;. &quot;Hope Has a Place&quot; was developed lyrically at first, after Roma had visited the Silent Valley Reservoir in the Mourne Mountains in Ireland, and wrote its words based around one&#x27;s first love for her daughter Ebony. Enya subsequently wrote a melody and visited the Silent Valley with Nicky, who suggested that she record the song&#x27;s lead vocal on location.

&quot;Tea-House Moon&quot; is the album&#x27;s third instrumental track. &quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; was influenced by Enya&#x27;s experience of singing hymns in her youth, and incorporated its structure and melody into the track. &quot;La Soñadora&quot; is Spanish for &quot;The Dreamer&quot;. Its lyrics were inspired by a poem recited by Amergin Glúingel, a Druid of the Milesian race, upon his arrival to Ireland from Spain. Enya has an ancestral connection to Spain through her mother&#x27;s side of the family; both aspects inspired her to sing it in Spanish, at Roma&#x27;s suggestion. To Enya, &quot;On My Way Home&quot; is about &quot;those wonderful memories and fond moments that you have when you&#x27;re on your way home&quot;, and wished to present a positive feel in the chorus. The song contains samples from two other Enya songs, &quot;Book of Days&quot; and &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;.

The original Japanese edition contains &quot;Oriel Window&quot;, a piano instrumental that was recorded around the time of &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, as a bonus track.

==Release and commercial performance==
To promote the album, Warner Music organised a pre-release event in London for journalists and broadcasters on the Silver Barracuda, a pleasure boat that travelled from Charing Cross to Greenwich, where a reception was held at Queen&#x27;s House complete with a fireworks display. The following day, Enya held a private conference for the press. A limited edition promotional box set was released, of which 1,001 copies were produced, which included the album on CD and cassette with a 14-page booklet containing notes and a foreword autographed by Roma Ryan and printed lyrics.

&quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; was released on 20 November 1995 by WEA in the United Kingdom and on 5 December 1995 by Reprise Records in the United States. It reached number one on the Irish Albums Chart, and became Enya&#x27;s fourth album to enter the top 10 of the UK Albums Chart, entering at number 6 before it reached its peak position of number 5 for two weeks in December 1995 during its initial 22-week run on the chart. The album re-entered the chart for a total of six weeks in 1996, and three more weeks in 1997. In the United States, &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, her highest-charting album in the country at the time of release, during a 66-week stay on the chart. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Age Albums chart, the album became Enya&#x27;s second consecutive number one during a 104-week stay. To further promote the album, Enya and Nicky travelled worldwide on a media tour that covered sixteen countries and included interviews, guest appearances, and lip-sync performances of &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;.

The album became an international commercial success. In December 1995, it was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for 300,000 copies sold in the United Kingdom. In August 1996, it reached double platinum for 600,000 copies sold. Its greatest success was in the United States where in February 1996, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling one million copies. In the following six months, a further one million copies were sold. In March 2000, &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; was certified triple platinum for selling three million. In November 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported the album had sold 2,397,724 copies in the United States according to figures tracked by Nielsen SoundScan.

Enya released a single from &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; in 1995 and 1996. &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; was the lead single, released in November 1995. It became her second-highest-charting single in the United Kingdom, reaching a peak of number 7 during its 13-week stay on the chart. In 2013, it was certified silver by the BPI for 200,000 copies sold. A music video for the song was directed by David Scheinmann, who had previous worked with Enya on the reissue of &quot;Enya&quot; and her other promotional videos. &quot;On My Way Home&quot; was the second single, released in November 1996. It reached number 26 in the United Kingdom during a two-week stay on the singles chart. Its video was directed by Dickins.

In February 1997, &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; earned Enya her second Grammy Award for Best New Age Album at the 39th edition of the award ceremony.

In 2009, the album was remastered for a Japanese release on Super High Material CD with three bonus tracks: &quot;I May Not Awaken&quot;, originally released as the B-side to the &quot;On My Way Home&quot; single, and single edits of the latter and &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;. On 11 November 2016, Reprise Records put the album out on vinyl for the first time.

==Critical reception==

Of frequent discussion was how little Enya&#x27;s sound and style changed. Some critics welcomed Enya continuing the formula, Jody Callahan of &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; exclaiming &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; was &quot;another Enya record, with all the myth and warmth that implies&quot;, and
&quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Don Heckman writing the style would still appeal to Enya&#x27;s fans. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reporter Elysa Gardner picked out &quot;China Roses&quot; as a track that reminded her of the &quot;tranquil radiance&quot; of &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot; from &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, with &quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; sounding &quot;equally tender, with a reassuring lyric and all the prettiness of a Christmas carol&quot;. Others found the lack of evolution a downside and resulting in a dull experience. Sullivan felt it was not &quot;quite as exotic or transcendent&quot; as Enya&#x27;s previous two albums, and wished for more &quot;movement and drama&quot;. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Enya &quot;even less the life of the pub&quot; with her new release: &quot;With its layered, breathing-lesson choral harmonies cushioned in sullen keyboards, the album is, except for a few perky moments, wistful to the point of stultification.&quot;

Nicky Ryans&#x27; production and Enya&#x27;s singing was acclaimed. Howard Cohen for &quot;The Los Angeles Daily News&quot; state the record does not &quot;disappoint, at least not stylistically&quot; with its &quot;flawless&quot; recording and &quot;gorgeous&quot; sounds. The &quot;technical proficiency and the mood-sustaining qualities&quot; of the music, that Heckman called &quot;mysterious&quot; and &quot;rich&quot; coupled with Enya&#x27;s &quot;angelic, folk soprano&quot; and &quot;nostalgic&quot; piano, flow to make a seamless album that &quot;almost demands that the album be heard in its entirety&quot;. Callahan praised the record&#x27;s &quot;sonorous melodies, glowing with strings, piano and crashing percussion; luxurious vocals&quot;. Joyce praised her vocals and Nicky Ryan&#x27;s production as forming a &quot;cascading shower of harmonies&quot;. Jim Sullivan of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; thought she and the Ryans produce &quot;serene ambience&quot; and &quot;new-age music with subtlety and smarts&quot;.

<text>Paint the Sky with Stars: The Best of Enya is the first greatest hits album by Irish singer-songwriter Enya, released on 3 November 1997 by WEA. Following her worldwide promotional tour in support of her previous album &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; (1995), Enya began selecting tracks for a compilation album in early 1997, as her recording contract with WEA permitted her to do so. The album contains songs from her debut album &quot;Enya&quot; (1987) to &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; (1995) and two new tracks, &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; and &quot;Only If...&quot;.

&quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, reaching number 4 in the United Kingdom and number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States. In the latter territory, the album continued to sell over the next eight years, reaching four million copies shipped in 2005. In Japan, it became the first non-Japanese album under the Warner label to receive a Japan Gold Disc Award in the Grand Prix Album category for selling over one million copies.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; received universal acclaim from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic rated the album five stars out of five and says that &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars: The Best of Enya&quot; is an excellent 16-song overview of Enya&#x27;s career, containing 14 selections from &quot;The Celts&quot;, &quot;Watermark&quot;, &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, and &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, including &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot;, &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, &quot;Marble Halls&quot;, &quot;Book of Days&quot; and, of course, &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;—as well as two previously unreleased songs (&quot;Only If...&quot;, &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot;) that fit comfortably with her past work.

<doc id="997138" wikidata="Q312724" url="?curid=997138" title="Robert Zoellick">
<text>Robert Bruce Zoellick (; ; born July 25, 1953) is an American public official and lawyer who was the 11th president of the World Bank Group, a position he held from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2012. He was previously chairman of international advisors at Goldman Sachs from 2006 to 2007, United States Deputy Secretary of State from 2005 to 2006, and U.S. Trade Representative from 2001 to 2005. Prior to those posts, from 1985 to 2001 he served in a variety of capacities in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, and the presidential campaign of George W. Bush, in addition to positions in various think tanks and academia.

Zoellick has been a senior fellow at Harvard&#x27;s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs since ending his term with the World Bank in 2012. Since 2017 he has been a Senior Counselor at Brunswick Group.

==Early life and education==
Zoellick was born in Evergreen Park, Illinois, the son of Gladys (Lenz) and William T. Zoellick. His ancestors were German and he was raised Lutheran. 

He grew up in Naperville, Illinois. He graduated in 1971 from Naperville Central High School. 

In 1975 he received a B.A. in history from Swarthmore College. In 1981 he received both a J.D. from Harvard Law School and a Master of Public Policy degree from Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

==Career==

===Judicial clerkship (1982–1983)===
Upon graduation from Harvard Law School, Zoellick served as a law clerk for Judge Patricia Wald on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1982 to 1983.

===Government service (1985–1992)===
Zoellick was special assistant to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Richard G. Darman from July to December 1985, and was counselor and executive secretary to United States Secretary of the Treasury James Baker from January to July 1988. 

He was issues director for the 1988 George H. W. Bush Presidential campaign from July to November 1988.

During Bush&#x27;s presidency, Zoellick served with Baker, by then Secretary of State, as Counselor of the United States Department of State from March 1989 to August 1992, and as Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs from May 1991 to August 1992.

Zoellick served as Bush&#x27;s personal representative or &quot;sherpa&quot; for the G7 Economic Summits in 1991 and 1992. He led the US Delegation to the Two Plus Four talks on German reunification; for his achievements in this role, the Federal Republic of Germany awarded him the Knight Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit.

Baker&#x27;s book &quot;The Politics of Diplomacy&quot; describes Zoellick as his &quot;right-hand man on NAFTA&quot;. In August 1992, Zoellick was appointed White House Deputy Chief of Staff and Assistant to the President.

===Business, academia, and politics (1993–2001)===

After leaving government service, Zoellick served from 1993 to 1997 as an Executive Vice President of Fannie Mae, and was also its General Counsel from 1993 through 1996. Afterwards, Zoellick was John M. Olin Visiting Professor of National Security Affairs at the U.S. Naval Academy (1997–98); and Research Scholar at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government (1999–2001). From July 1999 to February 2001, he was Senior International Advisor to Goldman Sachs.

He served as a member of the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1994 through 2001. From 1997 to 2001, he also served as director of the Aspen Strategy Group. 

From January 1999 to May 1999, Zoellick was president and CEO of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). He resigned due to pressure from the board, which objected to his role as an occasional adviser to George W. Bush&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign.

In the 2000 presidential election campaign, Zoellick served as a foreign policy advisor to George W. Bush as part of a group, led by Condoleezza Rice, which she termed The Vulcans, after her home town of Birmingham, Alabama. James Baker designated him as his second-in-command—&quot;a sort of chief operating officer or chief of staff&quot;—in the 36-day battle over the 2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida.

===U.S. Trade Representative (2001–2005)===
George W. Bush named Zoellick U.S. Trade Representative in his first term, making him a member of the Executive Office of the President and Cabinet of the United States. He took office on February 7, 2001.

According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative website, Zoellick completed negotiations to bring China and Taiwan into the World Trade Organization (WTO); developed a strategy to launch new global trade negotiations at the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2001 in Doha, Qatar; worked with Congress to enact the 2001 Jordan–United States Free Trade Agreement and the 2001 Vietnam Trade Agreement; and worked with Congress to pass the Trade Act of 2002, which included new Trade Promotion Authority.

According to journalist and author Nikolas Kozloff, Zoellick relentlessly promoted the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) over the objections of labor, environmentalist, and human rights groups, and engaged in fear-mongering around Daniel Ortega and Hugo Chavez to do so.
Zoellick played a key role in the U.S.-WTO dispute against the European Union over genetically modified foods. Before the U.S. filed its WTO lawsuit against the EU in 2003, Zoellick stated &quot;The EU&#x27;s moratorium violates WTO rules. People around the world have been eating biotech food for years. Biotech food helps nourish the world&#x27;s hungry population, offers tremendous opportunities for better health and nutrition, and protects the environment by reducing soil erosion and pesticide use.&quot;

===Deputy Secretary of State (2005–2006)===

On January 7, 2005, Bush nominated Zoellick to be Deputy Secretary of State. He assumed the office on February 22, 2005.

Zoellick was a major influence on the Bush administration&#x27;s policies regarding China. In an important speech on September 21, 2005, Zoellick challenged China &quot;to become a &#x27;responsible stakeholder&#x27; in the international system, contributing more actively than in the past to help shore up the stability of the international system from which it ha[d] benefited so greatly.&quot;

Zoellick was also the Bush administration&#x27;s point-man on the Darfur conflict peace process, making four trips to Sudan to press the two sides to agree. He spearheaded U.S. efforts in the 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement.

Zoellick resigned his position as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State in June 2006 to rejoin Goldman Sachs, this time as Vice Chairman, International, and to advise the investment bank on global strategy.

===President of the World Bank (2007–2012)===

On May 30, 2007, President George W. Bush nominated Zoellick to replace Paul Wolfowitz as President of the World Bank. He took office on July 1, 2007.

In a speech at the National Press Club in Washington in October 2007, Zoellick outlined &quot;six strategic themes in support of the goal of an inclusive and sustainable globalization&quot; to guide the future work of the World Bank: overcoming poverty and spurring sustainable growth in the poorest countries, especially Africa; addressing the problems of states coming out of conflict or seeking to avoid breakdown of the state; using a more differentiated business model for middle-income countries; fostering regional and global public goods that transcend national boundaries and benefit multiple countries and citizens; supporting development and opportunities in the Arab World; and using the World Bank&#x27;s &quot;brain trust&quot; of applied experience to address the five other strategic themes.

During Zoellick&#x27;s time at the World Bank, the institution&#x27;s capital stock was expanded and lending volumes increased to help member countries deal with the global financial and economic crisis; assistance was stepped up to deal with the famine in the Horn of Africa; a major increase in resources was achieved for the institution&#x27;s soft loan facility, the International Development Association (IDA), which lends to the poorest countries; and a reform was carried out to the World Bank&#x27;s shareholding, Executive Board and voting structure, to increase the influence of developing and emerging economies in the World Bank&#x27;s governance.

Zoellick made advances in the use of open data, promoted senior officials from developing countries, addressed climate change, expanded aid during the financial crisis and obtained a capital increase, with developing countries providing more than half.

Zoellick stepped down from the World Bank presidency when his term ended on June 30, 2012.

===Senior Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School (2012–present)===
After leaving the World Bank, Zoellick took up the position as a senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in July 2012. 

From October 2013 to September 2016, he served as Chairman of International Advisors to Goldman Sachs.

===Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign===

In August 2012, during the 2012 United States presidential election, Zoellick was appointed to lead the national security portion of Republican candidate Mitt Romney&#x27;s transition team should he be elected President of the United States. According to political commentator Fred Barnes, writing beforehand in &quot;The International Economy&quot; magazine, Zoellick at the time was considered a &quot;heavyweight with impressive government experience&quot;.

The selection of Zoellick drew criticism from conservatives, especially neoconservatives. 

Romney lost the election to incumbent Barack Obama.

==Views==

In a January 2000 &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; essay entitled &quot;Campaign 2000: A Republican Foreign Policy,&quot; Zoellick noted five Republican principles (respect for power, building and sustaining coalitions and alliances, recognizing common interests with international agreements and institutions, embracing new technologies for global politics and security, and the continuing presence of bad actors. &quot;[T]here is still evil in the world—people who hate America and the ideas for which it stands. Today, we face enemies who are hard at work to develop nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, along with the missiles to deliver them. The United States must remain vigilant and have the strength to defeat its enemies. People driven by enmity or by a need to dominate will not respond to reason or goodwill. They will manipulate civilized rules for uncivilized ends.&quot;

In Australia&#x27;s &quot;New Left Review&quot;, Gavan McCormack wrote that as USTR Zoellick had intervened during a 2004 privatization issue in Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi&#x27;s re-election campaign: &quot;The office of the U.S. Trade Representative has played an active part in drafting the Japan Post privatization law. An October 2004 letter from Robert Zoellick to Japan&#x27;s Finance Minister Takenaka Heizo, tabled in the Diet on August 2, 2005, included a handwritten note from Zoellick commending Takenaka. Challenged to explain this apparent U.S. government intervention in a domestic matter, Koizumi merely expressed his satisfaction that Takenaka had been befriended by such an important figure… It is hard to overestimate the scale of the opportunity offered to U.S. and global finance capital by the privatization of the Postal Savings System.&quot; 

In the lead-up to the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit and in the immediate wake of the U.S. elections and subsequent Fed QE2 monetary-policy move, Zoellick wrote in a &quot;Financial Times&quot; editorial that the Group of 20 leading economies should consider adopting a global reserve currency based on gold as part of structural reforms to the world’s foreign-exchange regime.

In March 2016, Zoellick was one of three Cabinet-level Republican officials to oppose Trump&#x27;s presidential candidacy, in an open letter signed by 122 members of the Republican national security community. In August 2016, Zoellick signed a letter from 50 of America&#x27;s most senior Republican national security officials, which warned that a Donald Trump presidency would be a national security risk and would threaten the nation&#x27;s well-being. In a November 1, 2016, interview with &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot;, Zoellick said &quot;My belief differences with Trump were not only placed on policy – his protectionism, his infatuation with authoritarian leaders and Vladimir Putin. But also that I think he is a narcissistic, ego-driven person and that he would be dangerous. I have had the good fortune to serve a number of different presidents and I know the importance of that job and I don&#x27;t want him in the Oval Office.&quot;

Zoellick is the author of the 2020 book, &quot;America in the World: A History of U.S. Diplomacy and Foreign Policy&quot;, which asserts that since the country&#x27;s founding, U.S. foreign policy has been defined by five traditions: the continent of North America; trade, transnationalism and technology; alliances and order; public and congressional support; and America’s purpose.

==Personal life==
Zoellick married Sherry Lynn Ferguson in 1980. They live in McLean, Virginia.

<text>An areostationary orbit, areosynchronous equatorial orbit (AEO), or Mars geostationary orbit is a circular areo­synchronous orbit (ASO) approximately in altitude above the Mars equator and following the direction of Mars&#x27;s rotation.

An object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to Mars&#x27;s rotational period, and so to ground observers it appears motionless in a fixed position in the sky. It is the Martian analog of a Geostationary orbit (GEO). The prefix &quot;areo-&quot; derives from Ares, the ancient Greek god of war and counterpart to the Roman god Mars, with whom the planet was identified.

Although it would allow for uninterrupted communication and observation of the Martian surface, no artificial satellites have been placed in this orbit due to the technical complexity of achieving and maintaining one.

== Characteristics ==

The radius of an areostationary orbit can be calculated using Kepler&#x27;s Third Law.

formula_1

Where:

Substituting the mass of Mars for M and the Martian sidereal day for T and solving for the semimajor axis yields a synchronous orbit radius of above the surface of the Mars equator. Subtracting Mars&#x27;s radius gives an orbital altitude of .

Two stable longitudes exist - 17.92°W and 167.83°E. Satellites placed at any other longitude will tend to drift to these stable longitudes over time.

== Feasibility ==
Several factors make placing a spacecraft into an areostationary orbit more difficult than a geostationary orbit. Since the areostationary orbit lies between Mars&#x27;s two natural satellites, Phobos (semi-major axis: 9,376 km) and Deimos (semi-major axis: 23,463 km), any satellites in the orbit will suffer increased orbital station keeping costs due to unwanted orbital resonance effects. Mars&#x27;s gravity is also much less spherical than earth due to uneven volcanism (i.e. Olympus Mons). This creates additional gravitational disturbances not present on earth, further destabilizing the orbit. Solar radiation pressure and sun-based perturbations are also present, as with an earth-based geostationary orbit. Actually placing a satellite into such an orbit is further complicated by the distance from earth and related challenges shared by any attempted Mars mission.
== Uses ==
Satellites in an areostationary orbit would allow for greater amounts of data to be relayed back from the Martian surface easier than by using current methods. Satellites in the orbit would also be ideal advantageous for monitoring Martian weather and mapping of the Martian surface.

In the early 2000s NASA explored the feasibility of placing communications satellites in an areocentric orbit as a part of the Mars Communication Network. In the concept, an areostationary relay satellite would transmit data from a network of landers and smaller satellites in lower Martian orbits back to earth.

<doc id="997147" wikidata="Q3134025" url="?curid=997147" title="Herk Harvey">
<text>Harold Arnold &quot;Herk&quot; Harvey (June 3, 1924 – April 3, 1996) was an American film director, screenwriter, actor and film producer, perhaps best known for his 1962 horror film &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;.

==Early life==
Harvey was born in Windsor, Colorado, the son of Everett and Minnie R. Prewitt Harvey. He grew up in Waverly, Illinois and in Fort Collins and was a graduate of Fort Collins High School before serving in the U.S. Navy as a Quartermaster, 3rd Class, during World War II, during which time he was studying chemical engineering. &quot;But when I got out,&quot; Harvey said, &quot;I decided that wasn&#x27;t for me and so I went into the theater.&quot;

Harvey came to Lawrence, Kansas in 1945 to study at the University of Kansas, where he majored in theater and acted in scores of college stage productions, including &quot;Hay Fever&quot;, &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, &quot;Beggar on Horseback&quot;, &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Joan of Lorraine&quot;, &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, &quot;Harvey&quot;, and &quot;Hamlet&quot;. During his years at KU, Harvey served as vice-president of the Dramatics Workshop and was a member of the Owl Society, an honorary organization for male juniors. He earned a bachelor of science degree in education from the KU speech and drama department in 1948 and subsequently became employed by that department as an instructor, while also a graduate student.

Harvey made his directorial debut with an &quot;experimental&quot; production of Irwin Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Bury the Dead&quot; in 1949, and went on to direct several other plays and pageants at the university. He received his master of arts degree in speech and dramatics from KU in 1950. The subject of his master&#x27;s thesis was his experience directing &quot;Bury the Dead&quot; for the KU stage. Besides his student appearances, Harvey gained acting experience through some work in summer stock, performing on the stages of the Topeka Civic Theater and Kansas City&#x27;s Resident Theater. It was with the latter organization that Harvey portrayed Stanley Kowalski in a 1958 production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

On June 3, 1950, Harvey&#x27;s 26th birthday, he married Bernice &quot;Bea&quot; Brady, a Wichita native with whom he had performed in numerous KU theater productions. Immediately following the marriage, Harvey did a graduate study in drama during the 1950 summer session at the University of Denver, and then studied at the University of Colorado for a doctorate. &quot;I made it through summer school and then I decided to go back to Kansas,&quot; Harvey has said. He and his wife then returned to Lawrence and both landed jobs teaching theater, Harvey at KU and his wife at the local high school.

==Centron Films==
While teaching and directing at the university, Harvey broke into the film business as an actor in some of the movies being made by Centron Corporation of Lawrence, an independent industrial and educational film production company. Founded in 1947 in Lawrence by Arthur H. Wolf and Russell A. Mosser, Centron would come to the forefront of the industrial and educational film companies in the United States. Harvey joined the staff in 1952 and went on to work for Centron as a film director, writer, and producer for over three decades, making a variety of short industrial, educational, documentary, and government films. Films created by Harvey include &quot;Shake Hands With Danger&quot;, which won a 1980 Golden Eagle award from the Council on International Nontheatrical Events. Centron competed with large companies on both coasts to become one of the top producers of industrial and educational films. Harvey was known for his high quality films, coming in on time and under budget. Harvey and his film crews were dispatched to far-flung locations around the globe to bring back images for geography and travel films. Harvey also worked with many well-known professional actors and entertainers in Centron films, such as Walter Pidgeon, Rowan and Martin, Dennis Day, Louis Nye, George Gobel, Billy Barty, Anita Bryant, Eddie Albert, Ed Ames, Jesse White, and Ricardo Montalbán. The director won many national and international awards for his work, including the highest honors from the American Film Festival, C.I.N.E., and the Columbus Film Festival.

An article written by Harvey was published in the March 1956 issue of &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; magazine, concerning innovative special effects techniques that had been developed by the Centron crew during the production of an industrial film. Harvey also occasionally penned reviews of local theater productions for the Lawrence newspaper. In 1957, Harvey commissioned the construction of a custom-built house within a block of the Centron studios. The resultant home was hailed regionally as an exceptional display of modern suburban architecture and attracted thousands of spectators when opened for public inspection upon its completion. The home&#x27;s hillside yard was criss-crossed with a winding network of stone walls and terraces, built by Harvey himself.

Harvey and his first wife Bea were divorced in 1960, due to the latter&#x27;s infidelity, and shortly afterward Harvey met Pauline G. Pappas, who was one of the investors for &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;. The two were married in 1967.

When a crew from ABC came to Lawrence in 1982 to shoot the controversial television movie on nuclear war, &quot;The Day After&quot;, they cast Harvey in a small speaking role as a farmer, while also casting a handful of other local thespians. The film was broadcast to much international publicity and controversy in 1983.

In 1981, Arthur Wolf and Russell Mosser had sold Centron to the Coronet division of Esquire, Inc., though production operations continued in Lawrence until decade&#x27;s end. After 33 years with the firm, Harvey retired from Centron in 1985. His last project for the company was a prize-winning series of educational travelogues shot in Korea.

After his retirement, Harvey continued in various activities, teaching film production at the University of Kansas, adjudicating films for the American Film Festival and the Kansas Film and Video Festival, and directing and acting in plays for the Lawrence Community Theater. He also had small speaking parts in the made-for-TV movies &quot;Murderer Ordained&quot; and &quot;Where Pigeons Go to Die&quot;, both of which were filmed on location in Kansas.

==&quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;==

Harvey is best known for his sole feature film, &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;, a low budget 1962 horror film starring Candace Hilligoss. It was produced and directed by Harvey for an estimated $33,000. Harvey had witnessed the recent success of Elmer Rhoden Jr. and fellow industrial filmmaker Robert Altman in producing low-budget feature films in nearby Kansas City, and began to secure backing from local investors in order to mount a similar project in Lawrence. While returning to Kansas after shooting a Centron film in California, Harvey developed the idea for &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; after driving past the abandoned Saltair Pavilion in Salt Lake City, Utah. Hiring an unknown New York actress, Lee Strasberg-trained Hilligoss, and otherwise employing mostly local talent, Harvey shot &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; in three weeks, on location in Lawrence and Salt Lake City, using a script penned by Centron associate John Clifford. Harvey also played an uncredited role as the film&#x27;s most prominent &quot;ghoul.&quot; Originally marketed as a B film and released by an upstart distribution company that quickly went bankrupt, &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; never gained widespread public attention upon its original release but today has become hailed as a cult classic. Set to an organ score by Gene Moore, &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; relies more on atmosphere than on special effects to create its mood of psychological horror. The film has a large cult following, built up primarily via late-night television screenings, and has been released on DVD by the Criterion Collection (complete with a host of special features, including an hour of excerpts from Harvey&#x27;s Centron productions). To this day, the movie is still discussed by film buffs and occasionally has screenings at Halloween and art film festivals.

Discouraged by the apparent failure of &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; and busy with Centron assignments, Harvey never directed another feature, though he did make several aborted attempts. One was &quot;Flannagan&#x27;s Smoke&quot;, a comedy script written by John Clifford concerning an escaped gas from a chemist&#x27;s laboratory and its effect on the townspeople. Another was &quot;The Reluctant Witch&quot;, with a screenplay adapted by KU professor James E. Gunn from his own science fiction short story of the same title. Unlike &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;, this was actually to be a Centron production, as Harvey had persuaded the company to delve into feature films. Shooting did begin, in the late 1960s, but it was not long before budgetary problems and conflicts with the lead actor ultimately shut down the production of &quot;The Reluctant Witch&quot;. Some unedited footage still survives. Harvey also wrote an un-produced feature screenplay of his own, entitled &quot;Windwagon&quot;, which was a historical dramatization of the Kansas territorial period and &quot;sailing wagon&quot; innovations of the late nineteenth century.

Harvey did live to see the belated recognition of &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;, which began in earnest during the mid-1980s. The peak of this revival of interest was a nationally publicized cast and crew reunion in Lawrence in 1989, followed by the movie&#x27;s first legal release on home video, which sparked a number of high-profile reviews and articles. Several years later, Harvey was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On April 3, 1996, weeks after the sound stage at KU&#x27;s Oldfather Studios (home of the KU film school and formerly Centron&#x27;s headquarters) was officially christened the &quot;Herk Harvey Sound Stage&quot; in a large ceremony, Harvey died at his home in Lawrence.

The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; in 2012.

<doc id="997163" wikidata="Q927271" url="?curid=997163" title="Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River">
<text>The Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River lies within the city boundaries of Christchurch, New Zealand, and is fed from springs near Templeton Road, with a catchment area in wet weather extending as far west as Yaldhurst and Pound Road. It meanders around the base of the Port Hills from west to south-east.

==Course==
The catchment of the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River extends to the suburb of Yaldhurst. It drains an area of approximately , with the Cashmere Stream the largest tributary. Curletts Stream flows through an industrial part of Christchurch before joining Ōpāwaho. The Heathcote River flows through Wigram, Hillmorton (where the main springs are located), Hoon Hay (and from there around the base of the Port Hills), Spreydon, Cracroft, Cashmere, Beckenham, St. Martins, Opawa, Woolston and Ferrymead.

It drains into the Avon Heathcote Estuary / Ihutai before draining into Pegasus Bay.

== Pre-European settlement and naming ==
The original name of this river, Ō-pā-waho means &#x27;The Place of the Outward Pā&#x27;, or &#x27;The Outpost&#x27; and refers to this pā being an outpost (Māori: waho) of Kaiapoi Pā. The pā was built in a higher location just downstream of the present Opawa Road Bridge. It was a resting place for Ngāi Tahu travelling between Kaiapoi Pā and Te Pātaka o Rākaihautū (Banks Peninsula). The surrounding area was an important mahinga kai, a source of plentiful food, especially tuere (blind eel) and kanakana (lamprey).

The river historically meandered through extensive wetlands prior to urbanisation. Historic survey maps from the mid-19th century (known as the &#x27;Black Maps&#x27;) indicate that the habitat that the river passed through was abundant in flax (harakeke), toetoe, raupō, tutu and ferns and was dotted with tī kōuka (cabbage tree).

The river corridor was low-lying and very wet. When the Waimakariri River rose and flowed across the plains, even higher ground was prone to flooding. Over many centuries of using the river as a food source and transport corridor, the iwi of Waitaha, Kāti Māmoe and Ngāi Tahu fostered a close relationship with this resource. The swamp forest around the river provided gathering grounds for water fowl and forest birds. Traps were regularly set for inanga (whitebait), pātiki (flounder), and tuna (eel).

The original European name for the river, the Heathcote, is in honour of Sir William Heathcote, secretary of the Canterbury Association.

==Management==

The Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River provided Woolston with plentiful water for industries such as wool scouring. The river became increasingly polluted until the Woolston industrial sewer was built in 1966.

Flooding was also a problem until 1986 when the Woolston Cut began to allow flood waters to bypass a long loop of the river, known as the Woolston Loop. The long project, which cost NZ$2m, had as a consequence that the trees on the riverbank died as far upstream as the Opawa bridge, and that banks collapsed. Extensive investigations revealed that the trees died from salt water travelling further upstream with every tide (with the salt killing the trees), that the soil structure changed (a sodium and calcium exchange in the clay molecules weakened the soils) and the tunnelling mud crab had extended its range up the river, further weakening the banks. As a mitigating measure, the Woolston Tidal Barrage was built at the upstream end of the cut, which is only opened in time of floods. During normal flow regimes, the Heathcote flows through the Woolston Loop. But despite the Woolston Cut, parts of the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River have flooded during heavy rainfall.

During 2008, Christchurch City Council consulted on a management plan for the section of river located between Colombo Street and Opawa Road, which was formally adopted on 9 April 2009.

The water quality in the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River is rated poorly by the Christchurch City Council in 2020. Eight of the thirteen worst monitored sites in rivers or streams in Christchurch were in the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote catchment.

Work has been completed in 2021 on stormwater basins at the upper Heathcote to improve the water quality, manage flood risk with an added benefit of providing additional recreational spaces. These include the Curletts stormwater basin and the, Wigram east basin. Work continues on the Eastman wetlands storage basins, Sutherlands storm water treatment basins and the flood storage basin in Worsleys valley near the Christchurch Adventure Park.

In the heavy rain which caused flooding across Canterbury at the end of May 2021, the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River did not flood any houses above floor level. This was despite of rain falling over a three-day period. The Christchurch City Council was pleased to see the work developing storm water basins had paid off.

<text>The areosynchronous orbits (ASO) are the synchronous orbits for artificial satellites around the planet Mars. They are the martian equivalent of the geosynchronous orbits (GSO) on the Earth. The prefix &quot;areo-&quot; derives from Ares, the ancient Greek god of war and counterpart to the Roman god Mars, with whom the planet was identified. The modern Greek word for Mars is &quot;Άρης&quot; (Áris).

As with all synchronous orbits, an areosynchronous orbit has an orbital period equal in length to the primary&#x27;s sidereal day. A satellite in areosynchronous orbit does &quot;not&quot; necessarily maintain a fixed position in the sky as seen by an observer on the surface of Mars; however, such a satellite will return to the same apparent position every Martian day.

The orbital altitude required to maintain an areosynchronous orbit is approximately . If a satellite in areosynchronous orbit were to be used as a communication relay link, it &quot;would experience communications ranges of &quot; to various points on the visible Martian surface.

An areosynchronous orbit that is equatorial (in the same plane as the equator of Mars), circular, and prograde (rotating about Mars&#x27;s axis in the same direction as the planet&#x27;s surface) is known as an areostationary orbit (AEO). To an observer on the surface of Mars, the position of a satellite in AEO would appear to be fixed in a constant position in the sky. The AEO is analogous to a geostationary orbit (GEO) about Earth.

Although no satellites currently occupy areosynchronous or areostationary orbits, some scientists foresee a future telecommunications network for the exploration of Mars.

<doc id="997173" wikidata="Q507369" url="?curid=997173" title="Electromyography">
<text>Electromyography (EMG) is a technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram. An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated. The signals can be analyzed to detect abnormalities, activation level, or recruitment order, or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement. Needle EMG is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique commonly used by neurologists. Surface EMG is a non-medical procedure used to assess muscle activation by several professionals, including physiotherapists, kinesiologists and biomedical engineers. In computer science, EMG is also used as middleware in gesture recognition towards allowing the input of physical action to a computer as a form of human-computer interaction.

==Clinical uses==
EMG testing has a variety of clinical and biomedical applications. Needle EMG is used as a diagnostics tool for identifying neuromuscular diseases, or as a research tool for studying kinesiology, and disorders of motor control. EMG signals are sometimes used to guide botulinum toxin or phenol injections into muscles. Surface EMG is used for functional diagnosis and during instrumental motion analysis. EMG signals are also used as a control signal for prosthetic devices such as prosthetic hands, arms and lower limbs.

An acceleromyograph may be used for neuromuscular monitoring in general anesthesia with neuromuscular-blocking drugs, in order to avoid postoperative residual curarization (PORC).

Except in the case of some purely primary myopathic conditions EMG is usually performed with another electrodiagnostic medicine test that measures the conducting function of nerves. This is called nerve conduction study (NCS). Needle EMG and NCSs are typically indicated when there is pain in the limbs, weakness from spinal nerve compression, or concern about some other neurologic injury or disorder. Spinal nerve injury does not cause neck, mid back pain or low back pain, and for this reason, evidence has not shown EMG or NCS to be helpful in diagnosing causes of axial lumbar pain, thoracic pain, or cervical spine pain. Needle EMG may aid with the diagnosis of nerve compression or injury (such as carpal tunnel syndrome), nerve root injury (such as sciatica), and with other problems of the muscles or nerves. Less common medical conditions include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, and muscular dystrophy.

== Technique ==

===Skin preparation and risks===
The first step before insertion of the needle electrode is skin preparation. This typically involves simply cleaning the skin with an alcohol pad.

The actual placement of the needle electrode can be difficult and depends on a number of factors, such as specific muscle selection and the size of that muscle. Proper needle EMG placement is very important for accurate representation of the muscle of interest, although EMG is more effective on superficial muscles as it is unable to bypass the action potentials of superficial muscles and detect deeper muscles. Also, the more body fat an individual has, the weaker the EMG signal. When placing the EMG sensor, the ideal location is at the belly of the muscle: the longitudinal midline. The belly of the muscle can also be thought of as in-between the motor point (middle) of the muscle and the tendonus insertion point.

Cardiac pacemakers and implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are used increasingly in clinical practice, and no evidence exists indicating that performing routine electrodiagnostic studies on patients with these devices pose a safety hazard. However, there are theoretical concerns that electrical impulses of nerve conduction studies (NCS) could be erroneously sensed by devices and result in unintended inhibition or triggering of output or reprogramming of the device. In general, the closer the stimulation site is to the pacemaker and pacing leads, the greater the chance for inducing a voltage of sufficient amplitude to inhibit the pacemaker. Despite such concerns, no immediate or delayed adverse effects have been reported with routine NCS.

No known contraindications exist for performing needle EMG or NCS on pregnant patients. Additionally, no complications from these procedures have been reported in the literature. Evoked potential testing, likewise, has not been reported to cause any problems when it is performed during pregnancy.

Patients with lymphedema or patients at risk for lymphedema are routinely cautioned to avoid percutaneous procedures in the affected extremity, namely venipuncture, to prevent development or worsening of lymphedema or cellulitis. Despite the potential risk, the evidence for such complications subsequent to venipuncture is limited. No published reports exist of cellulitis, infection, or other complications related to EMG performed in the setting of lymphedema or prior lymph node dissection. However, given the unknown risk of cellulitis in patients with lymphedema, reasonable caution should be exercised in performing needle examinations in lymphedematous regions to avoid complications. In patients with gross edema and taut skin, skin puncture by needle electrodes may result in chronic weeping of serous fluid. The potential bacterial media of such serous fluid and the violation of skin integrity may increase the risk of cellulitis. Before proceeding, the physician should weigh the potential risks of performing the study with the need to obtain the information gained.

===Surface and intramuscular EMG recording electrodes===
There are two kinds of EMG: surface EMG and intramuscular EMG. Surface EMG assesses muscle function by recording muscle activity from the surface above the muscle on the skin. Surface EMG can be recorded by a pair of electrodes or by a more complex array of multiple electrodes. More than one electrode is needed because EMG recordings display the potential difference (voltage difference) between two separate electrodes. Limitations of this approach are the fact that surface electrode recordings are restricted to superficial muscles, are influenced by the depth of the subcutaneous tissue at the site of the recording which can be highly variable depending on the weight of a patient, and cannot reliably discriminate between the discharges of adjacent muscles. Specific electrode placements and functional tests have been developed to minimize this risk, thus providing reliable examinations.

Intramuscular EMG can be performed using a variety of different types of recording electrodes. The simplest approach is a monopolar needle electrode. This can be a fine wire inserted into a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference; or two fine wires inserted into muscle referenced to each other. Most commonly fine wire recordings are for research or kinesiology studies. Diagnostic monopolar EMG electrodes are typically insulated and stiff enough to penetrate skin, with only the tip exposed using a surface electrode for reference. Needles for injecting therapeutic botulinum toxin or phenol are typically monopolar electrodes that use a surface reference, in this case, however, the metal shaft of a hypodermic needle, insulated so that only the tip is exposed, is used both to record signals and to inject. Slightly more complex in design is the concentric needle electrode. These needles have a fine wire, embedded in a layer of insulation that fills the barrel of a hypodermic needle, that has an exposed shaft, and the shaft serves as the reference electrode. The exposed tip of the fine wire serves as the active electrode. As a result of this configuration, signals tend to be smaller when recorded from a concentric electrode than when recorded from a monopolar electrode and they are more resistant to electrical artifacts from tissue and measurements tend to be somewhat more reliable. However, because the shaft is exposed throughout its length, superficial muscle activity can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles. Single fiber EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording areas, and allow for the discharges of individual muscle fibers to be discriminated.

To perform intramuscular EMG, typically either a monopolar or concentric needle electrode is inserted through the skin into the muscle tissue. The needle is then moved to multiple spots within a relaxed muscle to evaluate both insertional activity and resting activity in the muscle. Normal muscles exhibit a brief burst of muscle fiber activation when stimulated by needle movement, but this rarely lasts more than 100ms. The two most common pathologic types of resting activity in muscle are fasciculation and fibrillation potentials. A fasciculation potential is an involuntary activation of a motor unit within the muscle, sometimes visible with the naked eye as a muscle twitch or by surface electrodes. Fibrillations, however, are detected only by needle EMG, and represent the isolated activation of individual muscle fibers, usually as the result of nerve or muscle disease. Often, fibrillations are triggered by needle movement (insertional activity) and persist for several seconds or more after the movement ceases.

After assessing resting and insertional activity, the electromyographer assess the activity of muscle during voluntary contraction. The shape, size, and frequency of the resulting electrical signals are judged. Then the electrode is retracted a few millimetres, and again the activity is analyzed. This is repeated, sometimes until data on 10–20 motor units have been collected in order to draw conclusions about motor unit function. Each electrode track gives only a very local picture of the activity of the whole muscle. Because skeletal muscles differ in the inner structure, the electrode has to be placed at various locations to obtain an accurate study. For the interpretation of EMG study is important to evaluate parameters of tested muscle motor units. This process may well be partially automated using appropriate software.

Single fiber electromyography assesses the delay between the contractions of individual muscle fibers within a motor unit and is a sensitive test for dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction caused by drugs, poisons, or diseases such as myasthenia gravis. The technique is complicated and typically performed only by individuals with special advanced training.

Surface EMG is used in a number of settings; for example, in the physiotherapy clinic, muscle activation is monitored using surface EMG and patients have an auditory or visual stimulus to help them know when they are activating the muscle (biofeedback). A review of the literature on surface EMG published in 2008, concluded that surface EMG may be useful to detect the presence of neuromuscular disease (level C rating, class III data), but there are insufficient data to support its utility for distinguishing between neuropathic and myopathic conditions or for the diagnosis of specific neuromuscular diseases. EMGs may be useful for additional study of fatigue associated with post-poliomyelitis syndrome and electromechanical function in myotonic dystrophy (level C rating, class III data). Recently, with the rise of technology in sports, sEMG has become an area of focus for coaches to reduce the incidence of soft tissue injury and improve player performance.

Certain US states limit the performance of needle EMG by nonphysicians. New Jersey declared that it cannot be delegated to a physician&#x27;s assistant. Michigan has passed legislation saying needle EMG is the practice of medicine. Special training in diagnosing medical diseases with EMG is required only in residency and fellowship programs in neurology, clinical neurophysiology, neuromuscular medicine, and physical medicine and rehabilitation. There are certain subspecialists in otolaryngology who have had selective training in performing EMG of the laryngeal muscles, and subspecialists in urology, obstetrics and gynecology who have had selective training in performing EMG of muscles controlling bowel and bladder function.

===Maximal voluntary contraction===
One basic function of EMG is to see how well a muscle can be activated. The most common way that can be determined is by performing a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the muscle that is being tested. Each muscle group type has different characteristics, and MVC positions are varied for different muscle group types. Therefore, the researcher should be very careful while choosing the MVC position type to elicit the greater muscle activity level from the subjects.

The types of MVC positions can vary among muscle types, contingent upon the specific muscle group being considered, including trunk muscles, lower limb muscles, and others.

Muscle force, which is measured mechanically, typically correlates highly with measures of EMG activation of muscle. Most commonly this is assessed with surface electrodes, but it should be recognized that these typically record only from muscle fibers in close proximity to the surface.

Several analytical methods for determining muscle activation are commonly used depending on the application. The use of mean EMG activation or the peak contraction value is a debated topic. Most studies commonly use the maximal voluntary contraction as a means of analyzing peak force and force generated by target muscles. According to the article &quot;Peak and average rectified EMG measures: Which method of data reduction should be used for assessing core training exercises?&quot;, it was concluded that the &quot;average rectified EMG data (ARV) is significantly less variable when measuring the muscle activity of the core musculature compared to the peak EMG variable.&quot; Therefore, these researchers would suggest that &quot;ARV EMG data should be recorded alongside the peak EMG measure when assessing core exercises.&quot; Providing the reader with both sets of data would result in enhanced validity of the study and potentially eradicate the contradictions within the research.

===Other measurements===
EMG can also be used for indicating the amount of fatigue in a muscle. The following changes in the EMG signal can signify muscle fatigue: an increase in the mean absolute value of the signal, increase in the amplitude and duration of the muscle action potential and an overall shift to lower frequencies. Monitoring the changes of different frequency changes the most common way of using EMG to determine levels of fatigue. The lower conduction velocities enable the slower motor neurons to remain active.

A motor unit is defined as one motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it innervates. When a motor unit fires, the impulse (called an action potential) is carried down the motor neuron to the muscle. The area where the nerve contacts the muscle is called the neuromuscular junction, or the motor end plate. After the action potential is transmitted across the neuromuscular junction, an action potential is elicited in all of the innervated muscle fibers of that particular motor unit. The sum of all this electrical activity is known as a motor unit action potential (MUAP). This electrophysiologic activity from multiple motor units is the signal typically evaluated during an EMG. The composition of the motor unit, the number of muscle fibres per motor unit, the metabolic type of muscle fibres and many other factors affect the shape of the motor unit potentials in the myogram.

Nerve conduction testing is also often done at the same time as an EMG to diagnose neurological diseases.

Some patients can find the procedure somewhat painful, whereas others experience only a small amount of discomfort when the needle is inserted. The muscle or muscles being tested may be slightly sore for a day or two after the procedure.

=== EMG signal decomposition ===

EMG signals are essentially made up of superimposed motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) from several motor units. For a thorough analysis, the measured EMG signals can be decomposed into their constituent MUAPs. MUAPs from different motor units tend to have different characteristic shapes, while MUAPs recorded by the same electrode from the same motor unit are typically similar. Notably MUAP size and shape depend on where the electrode is located with respect to the fibers and so can appear to be different if the electrode moves position. EMG decomposition is non-trivial, although many methods have been proposed.

===EMG signal processing===
Rectification is the translation of the raw EMG signal to a signal with a single polarity, usually positive. The purpose of rectifying the signal is to ensure the signal does not average to zero, due to the raw EMG signal having positive and negative components. Two types of rectification are used: full-wave and half-wave rectification. Full-wave rectification adds the EMG signal below the baseline to the signal above the baseline to make a conditioned signal that is all positive. If the baseline is zero, this is equivalent to taking the absolute value of the signal. This is the preferred method of rectification because it conserves all of the signal energy for analysis. Half-wave rectification discards the portion of the EMG signal that is below the baseline. In doing so, the average of the data is no longer zero therefore it can be used in statistical analyses.

=== Limitations ===
Needle EMG used in clinical settings has practical applications such as helping to discover disease. Needle EMG has limitations, however, in that it does involve voluntary activation of muscle, and as such is less informative in patients unwilling or unable to cooperate, children and infants, and in individuals with paralysis. Surface EMG can have limited applications due to inherent problems associated with surface EMG. Adipose tissue (fat) can affect EMG recordings. Studies show that as adipose tissue increased the active muscle directly below the surface decreased. As adipose tissue increased, the amplitude of the surface EMG signal directly above the center of the active muscle decreased. EMG signal recordings are typically more accurate with individuals who have lower body fat, and more compliant skin, such as young people when compared to old. Muscle cross talk occurs when the EMG signal from one muscle interferes with that of another limiting reliability of the signal of the muscle being tested. Surface EMG is limited due to lack of deep muscles reliability. Deep muscles require intramuscular wires that are intrusive and painful in order to achieve an EMG signal. Surface EMG can measure only superficial muscles and even then it is hard to narrow down the signal to a single muscle.

=== Electrical characteristics ===
The electrical source is the muscle membrane potential of about –90 mV. Measured EMG potentials range between less than 50 μV and up to 30 mV, depending on the muscle under observation.

Typical repetition rate of muscle motor unit firing is about 7–20 Hz, depending on the size of the muscle (eye muscles versus seat (gluteal) muscles), previous axonal damage and other factors. Damage to motor units can be expected at ranges between 450 and 780 mV.

==Procedure outcomes==

=== Normal results ===
Muscle tissue at rest is normally electrically inactive. After the electrical activity caused by the irritation of needle insertion subsides, the electromyograph should detect no abnormal spontaneous activity (i.e., a muscle at rest should be electrically silent, with the exception of the area of the neuromuscular junction, which is, under normal circumstances, very spontaneously active). When the muscle is voluntarily contracted, action potentials begin to appear. As the strength of the muscle contraction is increased, more and more muscle fibers produce action potentials. When the muscle is fully contracted, there should appear a disorderly group of action potentials of varying rates and amplitudes (a complete recruitment); this can be described as an interference pattern.

=== Abnormal results ===
EMG findings vary with the type of disorder, the duration of the problem, the age of the patient, the degree to which the patient can be cooperative, the type of needle electrode used to study the patient, and sampling error in terms of the number of areas studied within a single muscle and the number of muscles studied overall. Interpreting EMG findings is usually best done by an individual informed by a focused history and physical examination of the patient, and in conjunction with the results of other relevant diagnostic studies performed including most importantly, nerve conduction studies, but also, where appropriate, imaging studies such as MRI and ultrasound, muscle and nerve biopsy, muscle enzymes, and serologic studies.

== History ==
The first documented experiments dealing with EMG started with Francesco Redi&#x27;s works in 1666. Redi discovered a highly specialized muscle of the electric ray fish (Electric Eel) generated electricity. By 1773, Walsh had been able to demonstrate that the eel fish&#x27;s muscle tissue could generate a spark of electricity. In 1792, a publication entitled &quot;De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius&quot; appeared, written by Luigi Galvani, in which the author demonstrated that electricity could initiate muscle contraction. Six decades later, in 1849, Emil du Bois-Reymond discovered that it was also possible to record electrical activity during a voluntary muscle contraction. The first actual recording of this activity was made by Marey in 1890, who also introduced the term electromyography. In 1922, Gasser and Erlanger used an oscilloscope to show the electrical signals from muscles. Because of the stochastic nature of the myoelectric signal, only rough information could be obtained from its observation. The capability of detecting electromyographic signals improved steadily from the 1930s through the 1950s, and researchers began to use improved electrodes more widely for the study of muscles. The AANEM was formed in 1953 as one of several currently active medical societies with a special interest in advancing the science and clinical use of the technique. Clinical use of surface EMG (sEMG) for the treatment of more specific disorders began in the 1960s. Hardyck and his researchers were the first (1966) practitioners to use sEMG. In the early 1980s, Cram and Steger introduced a clinical method for scanning a variety of muscles using an EMG sensing device.

Research began at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota under the guidance of Edward H. Lambert, MD, PhD (1915–2003) in the early 1950s. Lambert, known as the &quot;Father of EMG&quot;, with the assistance of his Research Technician, Ervin L Schmidt, a self taught electrical engineer, developed a machine that could be moved from the EMG Lab, and was relatively easy to use. Oscilloscopes at that time were not able to store or print results, so a Polaroid camera was affixed to the front on a hinge and synchronized to photograph the scan. Fellows studying at Mayo soon learned that this was a tool they wanted, too. As Mayo has no interest in marketing their inventions, Schmidt went on to continue to develop them in his basement for decades, selling them under the name ErMel Inc.

It was not until the middle of the 1980s that integration techniques in electrodes had sufficiently advanced to allow batch production of the required small and lightweight instrumentation and amplifiers. At present, a number of suitable amplifiers are commercially available. In the early 1980s, cables that produced signals in the desired microvolt range became available. Recent research has resulted in a better understanding of the properties of surface EMG recording. Surface electromyography is increasingly used for recording from superficial muscles in clinical or kinesiological protocols, where intramuscular electrodes are used for investigating deep muscles or localized muscle activity.

There are many applications for the use of EMG. EMG is used clinically for the diagnosis of neurological and neuromuscular problems. It is used diagnostically by gait laboratories and by clinicians trained in the use of biofeedback or ergonomic assessment. EMG is also used in many types of research laboratories, including those involved in biomechanics, motor control, neuromuscular physiology, movement disorders, postural control, and physical therapy.

==Research==
EMG can be used to sense isometric muscular activity where no movement is produced. This enables definition of a class of subtle motionless gestures to control interfaces without being noticed and without disrupting the surrounding environment. These signals can be used to control a prosthesis or as a control signal for an electronic device such as a mobile phone or PDA .

EMG signals have been targeted as control for flight systems. The Human Senses Group at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, CA seeks to advance man-machine interfaces by directly connecting a person to a computer. In this project, an EMG signal is used to substitute for mechanical joysticks and keyboards. EMG has also been used in research towards a &quot;wearable cockpit&quot;, which employs EMG-based gestures to manipulate switches and control sticks necessary for flight in conjunction with a goggle-based display.

Unvoiced or silent speech recognition recognizes speech by observing the EMG activity of muscles associated with speech. It is targeted for use in noisy environments, and may be helpful for people without vocal cords, with aphasia, with dysphonia, and more.

EMG has also been used as a control signal for computers and other devices. An interface device based on an EMG Switch can be used to control moving objects, such as mobile robots or an electric wheelchair. This may be helpful for individuals that cannot operate a joystick-controlled wheelchair. Surface EMG recordings may also be a suitable control signal for some interactive video games.

A joint project involving Microsoft, the University of Washington in Seattle, and the University of Toronto in Canada has explored using muscle signals from hand gestures as an interface device. A patent based on this research was submitted on June 26, 2008.

In 2016 a startup called Emteq Labs launched a virtual reality headset with embedded EMG sensors for measuring facial expressions. In September 2019 Facebook, later renamed Meta Platforms, bought a startup called CTRL-labs that was working on EMG. In 2024, Meta unveiled augmented reality glasses that were paired with a wristband that reads a user&#x27;s hand gestures using electromyography.

<text>Domestic Disturbance is a 2001 American psychological thriller film directed by Harold Becker and starring John Travolta, Vince Vaughn, Teri Polo, Steve Buscemi, and Matt O&#x27;Leary.

==Plot==
In Southport, Maryland, Susan Morrison, recently divorced from her husband Frank, a struggling boat builder, is marrying a younger and wealthier man, Rick Barnes. Danny, Susan and Frank&#x27;s twelve-year-old son, is clearly unhappy that his mother is remarrying. Susan asks Frank to allow Rick to go sailing with him and Danny, to help Danny bond with and accept Rick as a stepfather.

After the wedding, Danny and Rick play a game of catch, where Rick clearly becomes agitated with Danny&#x27;s ambivalent playing style and starts criticizing him harshly. The revelation that Susan and Rick are having a baby worsens the situation. After finding out about the baby, Danny stows away in Rick&#x27;s Chevy Suburban, planning to drop off it en route and visit his father. But while Danny is inside, he sees Rick murdering mysterious stranger Ray Coleman, who earlier attended the wedding unannounced, claiming to be an ex-business associate of Rick.

Danny reports the murder to his father and to the local police. Rick, however, has managed to dispose of most of the evidence, and is widely considered a pillar of the local community as he invested his money in the area, whereas Danny has a history of lying and misdemeanors. Frank believes his son, though, stemming from Rick&#x27;s notable unease around Ray at the ceremony and the fact that Danny never lies to him.

Frank does some investigating of his own and unearths Rick&#x27;s criminal past, which now stands to put his son and ex-wife at risk. Frank learns that Rick&#x27;s true identity is Jack Parnell, a criminal who was acquitted while his partners, Ray among them, were convicted because he framed them all for the crime. Ray had planned to get revenge on Jack by exposing him at the wedding. Jack tries to kill Frank by setting his boathouse on fire, but Frank manages to escape and expose Jack&#x27;s true identity to the police, who begin heading for Susan&#x27;s house.

At the house, Susan also realizes the truth when she sees a large burn on Jack&#x27;s arm, having heard about the fire at the boathouse minutes earlier. She tries to escape with Danny, but Jack knocks her out and takes Danny as a hostage, intending to flee. Frank arrives to confront Jack, and they both engage in a vicious fight, ending when a tied-up Danny pushes Jack into a fuse box, electrocuting and killing him. Susan has no serious physical injury from the conflict, aside from suffering a miscarriage. The police apologize to both Danny and Frank for not believing them about Jack, and the reunited father and son follow Susan as she is taken to the hospital via ambulance.

==Production==
In April 2001, while shooting the film in Wilmington, North Carolina, actor Steve Buscemi was slashed in the face while intervening in a bar fight between his friend Vince Vaughn, screenwriter Scott Rosenberg and a local man, Timothy Fogerty, who allegedly instigated the brawl.

==Release==
Paramount Pictures held the world premiere of &quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot; at the studio on October 30, 2001. The film&#x27;s stars were in attendance as well as many other guest celebrities. The film was then officially released on November 2, 2001 in 2,910 theaters throughout the United States. It did not prove to be a financial success, grossing only $45,246,095 domestically. By the end of its run, the film was only able to gross $54 million worldwide from its $75 million budget.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD on September 3, 2002 by Paramount Home Entertainment.

==Critical reaction==
&quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot; was received poorly by critics, and gains a 24% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 100 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10. The consensus reads: &quot;Well-made but extremely predictable, &quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot; is an average thriller that may work better on TV.&quot; On Metacritic, it holds a score of 29 out of 100, based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of a possible four, reciting an anecdote about how the Chicago film critics had been shown the wrong last reel. He saw the correct one the following Monday, and scathingly said of it in his review: &quot;The earlier reel was lacking the final music. Music is the last thing wrong with that reel.&quot;

==Accolades==
Matt O&#x27;Leary was nominated for a Young Artist Award, for Best Performance in a Feature Film – Supporting Young Actor. However, star John Travolta was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Actor (also for &quot;Swordfish&quot;). Vaughn and Travolta later worked in &quot;Be Cool&quot; together.

<doc id="997178" wikidata="Q7115954" url="?curid=997178" title="Oxygen minimum zone">
<text>The oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), sometimes referred to as the shadow zone, is the zone in which oxygen saturation in seawater in the ocean is at its lowest. This zone occurs at depths of about , depending on local circumstances. OMZs are found worldwide, typically along the western coast of continents, in areas where an interplay of physical and biological processes concurrently lower the oxygen concentration (biological processes) and restrict the water from mixing with surrounding waters (physical processes), creating a &quot;pool&quot; of water where oxygen concentrations fall from the normal range of 4–6 mg/L to below 2 mg/L.

== Physical and biological processes ==
Surface ocean waters generally have oxygen concentrations close to equilibrium with the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. In general, colder waters hold more oxygen than warmer waters. As water moves out of the mixed layer into the thermocline, it is exposed to a rain of organic matter from above. Aerobic bacteria feed on this organic matter; oxygen is used as part of the bacterial metabolic process, lowering its concentration within the water. Therefore, the concentration of oxygen in deep water is dependent on the amount of oxygen it had when it was at the surface, minus depletion by deep sea organisms.

The downward flux of organic matter decreases sharply with depth, with 80–90% being consumed in the top . The deep ocean thus has higher oxygen because rates of oxygen consumption are low compared with the supply of cold, oxygen-rich deep waters from polar regions. In the surface layers, oxygen is supplied by photosynthesis of phytoplankton. Depths in between, however, have higher rates of oxygen consumption and lower rates of advective supply of oxygen-rich waters. In much of the ocean, mixing processes enable the resupply of oxygen to these waters (see upwelling).

A distribution of the open-ocean oxygen minimum zones is controlled by the large-scale ocean circulation as well as local physical as well as biological processes. For example, wind blowing parallel to the coast causes Ekman transport that upwells nutrients from deep water. The increased nutrients support phytoplankton blooms, zooplankton grazing, and an overall productive food web at the surface. The byproducts of these blooms and the subsequent grazing sink in the form of particulate and dissolved nutrients (from phytodetritus, dead organisms, fecal pellets, excretions, shed shells, scales, and other parts). This &quot;rain&quot; of organic matter (see the biological pump) feeds the microbial loop and may lead to bacterial blooms in water below the euphotic zone due to the influx of nutrients. Since oxygen is not being produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis below the euphotic zone, these microbes use up what oxygen is in the water as they break down the falling organic matter thus creating the lower oxygen conditions.

Physical processes then constrain the mixing and isolate this low oxygen water from outside water. Vertical mixing is constrained due to the separation from the mixed layer by depth. Horizontal mixing is constrained by bathymetry and boundaries formed by interactions with sub-tropical gyres and other major current systems. Low oxygen water may spread (by advection) from under areas of high productivity up to these physical boundaries to create a stagnant pool of water with no direct connection to the ocean surface even though (as in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific) there may be relatively little organic matter falling from the surface.

=== Microbes ===
In OMZs oxygen concentration drops to levels &lt;10 nM at the base of the oxycline and can remain anoxic for over 700 m depth. This lack of oxygen can be reinforced or increased due to physical processes changing oxygen supply such as eddy-driven advection, sluggish ventilation, increases in ocean stratification, and increases in ocean temperature which reduces oxygen solubility.

At a microscopic scale the processes causing ocean deoxygenation rely on microbial aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is a metabolic process that microorganisms like bacteria or archaea use to obtain energy by degrading organic matter, consuming oxygen, producing CO2 and obtaining energy in the form of ATP. In the ocean surface photosynthetic microorganisms called phytoplankton use solar energy and CO2 to build organic molecules (organic matter) releasing oxygen in the process. A large fraction of the organic matter from photosynthesis becomes dissolved organic matter (DOM) that is consumed by bacteria during aerobic respiration in sunlit waters. Another fraction of organic matter sinks to the deep ocean forming aggregates called marine snow. These sinking aggregates are consumed via degradation of organic matter and respiration at depth.

At depths in the ocean where no light can reach, aerobic respiration is the dominant process. When the oxygen in a parcel of water is consumed, the oxygen cannot be replaced without the water reaching the surface ocean. When oxygen concentrations drop to below &lt;10 nM, microbial processes that are normally inhibited by oxygen can take place like denitrification and anammox. Both processes extract elemental nitrogen from nitrogen compounds and that elemental nitrogen which does not stay in solution escapes as a gas, resulting in a net loss of nitrogen from the ocean.

=== Bioavailability of oxygen ===

==== Oxygen demand ====
An organism&#x27;s demand for oxygen is dependent on its metabolic rate. Metabolic rates can be affected by external factors such as the temperature of the water, and internal factors such as the species, life stage, size, and activity level of the organism. The body temperature of ectotherms (such as fishes and invertebrates) fluctuates with the temperature of the water. As the external temperature increases, ectotherm metabolisms increase as well, increasing their demand for oxygen. Different species have different basal metabolic rates and therefore different oxygen demands.

Life stages of organisms also have different metabolic demands. In general, younger stages tend to grow in size and advance in developmental complexity quickly. As the organism reaches maturity, metabolic demands switch from growth and development to maintenance, which requires far fewer resources. Smaller organisms have higher metabolisms per unit of mass, so smaller organisms will require more oxygen per unit mass, while larger organisms generally require more total oxygen. Higher activity levels also require more oxygen.

This is why bioavailability is important in deoxygenated systems: an oxygen quantity which is dangerously low for one species might be more than enough for another species.

==== Indices and calculations ====
Several indices to measure bioavailability have been suggested: Respiration Index, Oxygen Supply Index, and the Metabolic Index. The Respiration Index describes oxygen availability based on the free energy available in the and products of the stoichiometric equation for respiration. However, organisms have ways of altering their oxygen intake and carbon dioxide release, so the strict stoichiometric equation is not necessarily accurate. The Oxygen Supply Index accounts for oxygen solubility and partial pressure, along with the Q10 of the organism, but does not account for behavioral or physiological changes in organisms to compensate for reduced oxygen availability. The Metabolic Index accounts for the supply of oxygen in terms of solubility, partial pressure, and diffusivity of oxygen in water, and the organism&#x27;s metabolic rate. The metabolic index is generally viewed as a closer approximation of oxygen bioavailability than the other indices.

There are two thresholds of oxygen required by organisms:
* &quot;Pcrit&quot; (critical partial pressure)- the oxygen level below which an organism cannot support a normal respiration rate
* &quot;Pleth&quot; (lethal partial pressure)- the oxygen level below which an organism cannot support the minimum respiration rate necessary for survival.

Since bioavailability is specific to each organism and temperature, calculation of these thresholds is done experimentally by measuring activity and respiration rates under different temperature and oxygen conditions, or by collecting data from separate studies.

== Life in the OMZ ==

Despite the low oxygen conditions, organisms have evolved to live in and around OMZs. For those organisms, like the vampire squid, special adaptations are needed to either make do with lesser amounts of oxygen or to extract oxygen from the water more efficiently. For example, the giant red mysid (&quot;Gnathophausia ingens&quot;) continues to live aerobically (using oxygen) in OMZs. They have highly developed gills with large surface area and thin blood-to-water diffusion distance that enables effective removal of oxygen from the water (up to 90% O2 removal from inhaled water) and an efficient circulatory system with high capacity and high blood concentration of a protein (hemocyanin) that readily binds oxygen.

Another strategy used by some classes of bacteria in the oxygen minimum zones is to use nitrate rather than oxygen, thus drawing down the concentrations of this important nutrient. This process is called denitrification. The oxygen minimum zones thus play an important role in regulating the productivity and ecological community structure of the global ocean. For example, giant bacterial mats floating in the oxygen minimum zone off the west coast of South America may play a key role in the region&#x27;s extremely rich fisheries, as bacterial mats the size of Uruguay have been found there.

=== Zooplankton ===
Decreased oxygen availability results in decreases in many zooplankton species’ egg production, food intake, respiration, and metabolic rates. Temperature and salinity in areas of decreased oxygen concentrations also affect oxygen availability. Higher temperatures and salinity lower oxygen solubility decrease the partial pressure of oxygen. This decreased partial pressure increases organisms’ respiration rates, causing the oxygen demand of the organism to increase.

In addition to affecting their vital functions, zooplankton alter their distribution in response to hypoxic or anoxic zones. Many species actively avoid low oxygen zones, while others take advantage of their predators’ low tolerance for hypoxia and use these areas as a refuge. Zooplankton that exhibit daily vertical migrations to avoid predation and low oxygen conditions also excrete ammonium near the oxycline and contribute to increased anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox, which produces N2 gas. As hypoxic regions expand vertically and horizontally, the habitable ranges for phytoplankton, zooplankton, and nekton increasingly overlap, increasing their susceptibility to predation and human exploitation.

== Changes ==
OMZs have changed over time due to effects from numerous global chemical and biological processes. To assess these changes, scientists utilize climate models and sediment samples to understand changes to dissolved oxygen in OMZs. Many recent studies of OMZs have focused on their fluctuations over time and how they may be currently changing as a result of climate change.

=== In geological time scales ===
Some research has aimed to understand how OMZs have changed over geological time scales. Throughout the history of Earth&#x27;s oceans, OMZs have fluctuated on long time scales, becoming larger or smaller depending on multiple variables. The factors that change OMZs are the amount of oceanic primary production resulting in increased respiration at greater depths, changes in the oxygen supply due to poor ventilation, and amount of oxygen supplied through thermohaline circulation.

<text>Lenovo Group Limited, trading as Lenovo ( , ), is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in designing, manufacturing, and marketing consumer electronics, personal computers, software, servers, converged and hyperconverged infrastructure solutions, and related services. Its global headquarters are in Beijing, and Morrisville, North Carolina, United States; it has research centers at these locations, elsewhere in China, in Stuttgart, Germany, and in Yamato, Kanagawa, Japan.

Lenovo originated as an offshoot of a state-owned research institute. Then known as Legend and distributing foreign IT products, co-founder Liu Chuanzhi incorporated Legend in Hong Kong in an attempt to raise capital and was successfully permitted to build computers in China, and were helped by the American AST Research. Legend listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1994 and became the largest PC manufacturer in China and eventually in Asia; they were also domestic distributors for HP printers, Toshiba laptops, and others. After the company rebranded itself to Lenovo, it acquired IBM&#x27;s PC business including its ThinkPad line in 2005, after which it rapidly expanded abroad. In 2013, Lenovo became the world&#x27;s largest personal computer vendor by unit sales for the first time, a position it still holds as of 2024.

Products manufactured by the company include desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers, smartphones, workstations, servers, supercomputers, data storage devices, IT management software, and smart televisions. Its best-known brands include its ThinkPad business line of notebooks, the IdeaPad, Yoga, LOQ, and Legion consumer lines of notebooks, and the IdeaCentre, LOQ, Legion, and ThinkCentre lines of desktops. Lenovo is also part of a joint venture with NEC, named Lenovo NEC Holdings, that produces personal computers for the Japanese market. The company also operates Motorola Mobility which produces smartphones.

==History==
===1984–1993: Founding and early history===
Lenovo was founded in Beijing on 1 November 1984 as Legend by a team of engineers led by Liu Chuanzhi and Danny Lui. Initially specializing in televisions, the company migrated towards manufacturing and marketing computers.
Liu Chuanzhi and his group of ten experienced engineers, teaming up with Danny Lui, officially founded Lenovo in Beijing on 1 November 1984, with 200,000 yuan. The Chinese government approved Lenovo&#x27;s incorporation on the same day. Jia Xufu (贾续福), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicated that the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on 17 October the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Zeng Maochao (曾茂朝). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.

The organizational structure of the company was established in 1985 after the Chinese New Year. It included technology, engineering, administrative, and office departments. The group first attempted to import televisions but failed. It rebuilt itself as a company doing quality checks on computers. It also tried and failed to market a digital watch.

In May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement on the front page of the &quot;China Youth News&quot;. Such ads were quite rare in China at the time. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had the authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Yang Yuanqing, the current chairman and CEO of Lenovo, was among that group.

Liu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu&#x27;s father, already in Hong Kong along with Lui, furthered his son&#x27;s ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.

In 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name. Some of the company&#x27;s early successes included the KT8920 mainframe computer. It also developed a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters.

===1994–1998: IPO, second offerings and bond sales===
Lenovo (known at the time as Legend) became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong IPO that raised nearly at per share. Prior to the IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. On its first day of trading, the company&#x27;s stock price hit a high of and closed at suggesting an initial under-valuing of the company. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.

By 1996, Lenovo was the market leader in China and began selling its own laptop. By 1998 it held 43 per cent of the domestic computer market share in China, selling approximately one million computers.

Lenovo released its Tianxi () computer in 1998. Designed to make it easy for inexperienced Chinese consumers to use computers and access the internet, one of its most important features was a button that instantly connected users to the internet and opened the Web browser. It was co-branded with China Telecom and it was bundled with one year of Internet service. The Tianxi was released in 1998. It was the result of two years of research and development. It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone.

===1999–2010: IBM purchase and sale of smartphone division===

To fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about . It rebranded to the name Lenovo in 2003 and began making acquisitions to expand the company.

Lenovo acquired IBM&#x27;s personal computer business in 2005, including the ThinkPad laptop and ThinkCentre desktop lines. Lenovo&#x27;s acquisition of IBM&#x27;s personal computer division accelerated access to foreign markets while improving Lenovo&#x27;s branding and technology. Lenovo paid for IBM&#x27;s computer business and assumed an additional of IBM&#x27;s debt. This acquisition made Lenovo the third-largest computer maker worldwide by volume. Lenovo&#x27;s purchase of the Think line from IBM also led to the creation of the IBM/Lenovo partnership, which works together in the creation of Think-line of products sold by Lenovo.

On the purchase of IBM&#x27;s personal computer division, Chuanzhi said in 2012: &quot;We benefited in three ways from the IBM acquisition. We got the ThinkPad brand, IBM&#x27;s more advanced PC manufacturing technology and the company&#x27;s international resources, such as its global sales channels and operation teams. These three elements have shored up our sales revenue in the past several years.&quot; The employees of the division, including those who developed ThinkPad laptops and ThinkCentre desktops, became employees of Lenovo.

Despite Lenovo acquiring the &quot;Think&quot; brand from IBM, IBM still plays a key indirect, background role in the design and production of the Think line of products. Today, IBM is responsible for overseeing servicing and repair centers, and is considered an authorized distributor and refurbisher of the Think line of products produced by Lenovo.

IBM also acquired an 18.9% share of Lenovo in 2005 as part of Lenovo&#x27;s purchase of IBM&#x27;s personal computing division. In the years following the deal, IBM sold their stake in Lenovo, with a final sale in 2011 completing their divestment.

Mary Ma, Lenovo&#x27;s chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo&#x27;s emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on China Central Television (CCTV). Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.

Lenovo sold its smartphone and tablet division in 2008 for in order to focus on personal computers and then paid US$200 million to buy it back in November 2009. , the mobile division ranked third in terms of unit share in China&#x27;s mobile handset market. Lenovo invested in a fund dedicated to providing seed funding for mobile application development for its LeGarden online app store. As of 2010, LeGarden had more than 1,000 programs available for the LePhone. At the same time, LeGarden counted 2,774 individual developers and 542 developer companies as members.

===2011–2013: Re-entering smartphone market and other ventures===

On 27 January 2011, Lenovo formed a joint venture to produce personal computers with Japanese electronics firm NEC. The companies said in a statement that they would establish a new company called Lenovo NEC Holdings, to be registered in the Netherlands. NEC received US$175 million in Lenovo stock. Lenovo was to own a 51% stake in the joint venture, while NEC would have 49%. Lenovo has a five-year option to expand its stake in the joint venture.

This joint venture was intended to boost Lenovo&#x27;s worldwide sales by expanding its presence in Japan, a key market for personal computers. NEC spun off its personal computer business into the joint venture. As of 2010, NEC controlled about 20% of Japan&#x27;s market for personal computers while Lenovo had a 5% share. Lenovo and NEC also agreed to explore cooperating in other areas such as servers and tablet computers.

Roderick Lappin, chairman of the Lenovo–NEC joint venture, told the press that the two companies will expand their co-operation to include the development of tablet computers.

In June 2011, Lenovo announced that it planned to acquire control of Medion, a German electronics manufacturing company. Lenovo said the acquisition would double its share of the German computer market, making it the third-largest vendor by sales (after Acer and Hewlett-Packard). The deal, which closed in the third quarter of the same year, was claimed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the first in which a Chinese company acquired a well-known German company.&quot;

This acquisition will give Lenovo 14% of the German computer market. Gerd Brachmann, chairman of Medion, agreed to sell two-thirds of his 60 per cent stake in the company. He will be paid in cash for 80 per cent of the shares and will receive 20 per cent in Lenovo stock. That would give him about one percent of Lenovo.

In September 2012, Lenovo agreed to acquire the Brazil-based electronics company Digibras, which sells products under the brand-name CCE, for a base price of R$300 million (US$148 million) in a combination of stock and cash. An additional payment of R$400 million was made dependent upon performance benchmarks. Prior to its acquisition of CCE, Lenovo already established a $30 million factory in Brazil, but Lenovo&#x27;s management had felt that they needed a local partner to maximize regional growth. Lenovo cited their desire to take advantage of increased sales due to the 2014 World Cup that would be hosted by Brazil and the 2016 Summer Olympics and CCE&#x27;s reputation for quality. Following the acquisition, Lenovo announced that its subsequent acquisitions would be concentrated in software and services.

In September 2012, Lenovo agreed to acquire the United States–based software company Stoneware, in its first software acquisition. The transaction was expected to close by the end of 2012; no financial details have been disclosed. Lenovo said that the company was acquired in order to gain access to new technology and that Stoneware is not expected to significantly affect earnings. More specifically, Stoneware was acquired to further Lenovo&#x27;s efforts to improve and expand its cloud-computing services. For the two years prior to its acquisition, Stoneware partnered with Lenovo to sell its software. During this period Stoneware&#x27;s sales doubled. Stoneware was founded in 2000. As of September 2012, Stoneware is based in Carmel, Indiana, and has 67 employees.

Lenovo re-entered the smartphone market in 2012 and quickly became the largest vendor of smartphones in mainland China. Entry into the smartphone market was paired with a change of strategy from &quot;the one-size-fits-all&quot; to a diverse portfolio of devices. These changes were driven by the popularity of Apple&#x27;s iPhone and Lenovo&#x27;s desire to increase its market share in mainland China. Lenovo surpassed Apple Inc. to become the No. 2 provider of smartphones in the domestic Chinese market in 2012. However, with approximately 100 smartphone brands sold in China, this only equated to a 10.4% market share.

In May 2012, Lenovo announced an investment of US$793 million in the construction of a mobile phone manufacturing and R&amp;D facility in Wuhan, Hubei.

In 2013, Lenovo created a joint venture with EMC named Iomega. The venture took over Iomega&#x27;s business and rebranded all of Iomega&#x27;s products under the LenovoEMC brand, and designed products for small and medium-sized businesses that could not afford enterprise-class data storage. Lenovo has since retired all of the LenovoEMC products on their product page advising that the products are no longer available for purchase on lenovo.com.

===Since 2014: Purchase of IBM server lines and other acquisitions===

IBM sold its x86-based server lines, including System x and Blade Center, to Lenovo in 2014. Lenovo says it will gain access to more enterprise customers, improve its profit margins, and develop a closer relationship with Intel, the maker of most server processors, through its acquisition of IBM&#x27;s x86-based server business. On 1 October 2014, Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM&#x27;s server division, with the final price put at $2.1 billion. Lenovo said this acquisition came in at a price lower than the previously announced $2.3 billion partially because of a change in the value of IBM inventories. The deal has been already approved by Europe and China. Per Forbes, the United States Department of Treasury Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was reportedly the last major hurdle for Lenovo, since the United States has the strictest policies. According to Timothy Prickett-Morgan from Enterprise Tech, the deal still awaits &quot;approval of regulators in China, the European Commission, and Canada&quot;.

After closing, Lenovo said that its goal was to become the world&#x27;s largest maker of servers. Lenovo also announced plans to start integrating IBM&#x27;s workforce. The acquisition added about 6,500 new employees to Lenovo. Lenovo said that it has no immediate intent to cut jobs. Lenovo said that positions in research and development and customer-facing roles such as marketing would be &quot;100% protected&quot;, but expected &quot;rationalization&quot; of its supply chain and procurement.
On 29 January 2014, Google announced it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for US$2.91 billion. As of February 2014, Google owned about 5.94% of Lenovo&#x27;s stock. The deal included smartphone lines like the Moto X, Moto G, Droid Turbo, and the future Motorola Mobility product roadmap, while Google retained the Advanced Technologies &amp; Projects unit and all but 2,000 of the company&#x27;s patents. Lenovo received royalty free licenses to all the patents retained by Google. Lenovo received approval from the European Union for its acquisition of Motorola in June 2014. The acquisition was completed on 30 October 2014. Motorola Mobility remained headquartered in Chicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, but Liu Jun, president of Lenovo&#x27;s mobile device business, became the head of the company.

In April 2014, Lenovo purchased a portfolio of patents from NEC related to mobile technology. These included over 3,800 patent families in countries around the world. The purchase included standards-essential patents for 3G and LTE cellular technologies and other patents related to smartphones and tablets.

In May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan &quot;Innovation Never Stands Still&quot; (). Lenovo&#x27;s new logo, created by Saatchi, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging &quot;e&quot; and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo&#x27;s Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, &quot;When we first started looking at it, it wasn&#x27;t about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked &#x27;If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?&#x27; We came up with the idea of a digital logo first [...] designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.&quot;

In early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds were sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo&#x27;s history. Financial commentators noted that Lenovo was paying a premium to list the bonds in yuan given relatively low costs for borrowing in US dollars.

Lenovo said that its x86 servers will be available to all its channel partners. Lenovo plans to cut prices on x86 products in order to gain market share. This goes in alliance with IBM&#x27;s vision of the future around cloud technologies and their own POWER processor architecture.

Lenovo&#x27;s acquisition of IBM&#x27;s businesses is arguably one of the greatest case studies on merging massive international enterprises. Though this acquisition in 2005 ultimately resulted in success, the integration of the businesses had a difficult and challenging beginning. Lenovo had employees from different cultures, different backgrounds, and different languages. These differences caused misunderstandings, hampering trust and the ability to build a new corporate culture. At the end of its first two years, Lenovo Group had met many of its original challenges, including integrating two disparate cultures in the newly formed company, maintaining the Think brand image for quality and innovation, and improving supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies. However, Lenovo had failed to meet a key objective of the merger: leveraging the combined strength of the two companies to grow volume and market share. In order to achieve success, Lenovo embraced diversification at multiple levels- business model, culture, and talent. By 2015, Lenovo grew into the world&#x27;s number 1 PC maker, number 3 smartphone manufacturer and number 3 in the production of tablet computers.

In March 2017, Lenovo announced it was partnering with Fort Lauderdale, Florida–based software storage virtualization company DataCore to add DataCore&#x27;s parallel I/O-processing software to Lenovo&#x27;s storage devices. The servers were reportedly designed to outperform Storage Area Network (SAN) SAN arrays.

In 2017, Lenovo formed a joint venture with Fujitsu and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ). In the joint venture, Fujitsu would sell Lenovo a 51% stake in Fujitsu Client Computing Limited. DBJ would acquire a 5% stake.

In September 2018, Lenovo and NetApp announced about strategic partnership and joint venture in China. As part of strategic partnership Lenovo started two new lines of storage systems: DM-Series and DE-Series. Both storage systems using Lenovo hardware and NetApp software: DM-Series using ONTAP OS and DE-Series SANtricity OS.

In 2018, Lenovo became the world&#x27;s largest provider for the TOP500 supercomputers.

In 2020, Lenovo became a preferred data center innovation provider for DreamWorks Animation starting with Trolls World Tour.

On 12 January 2021, Lenovo filed an application to issue Chinese depositary receipts, representing newly issued ordinary shares, and to list them on the Science and Technology Innovation Board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

In April 2021, Lenovo was reorganized into three divisions: The Intelligent Devices Group for PCs, Smartphones, Smart Collaboration products, Augmented and Virtual Reality solutions and Internet of Things devices, the Infrastructure Solutions Group (formally known as Data Center Group) for smart infrastructure solutions, and the Solutions and Services Group focused on services and industry-specific products. That year, the company hit $60 billion in annual revenues.

On 8 October 2021, Lenovo withdrew its application to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange just days after it had been accepted by the exchange, citing the possibility of the validity of financial information in its prospectus lapsing as the reason. The price of the company&#x27;s shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by over 17% following the news, which was its biggest intraday decline in over a decade.

==Name==

&quot;Lenovo&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;Le-&quot; (from Legend) and &quot;novo&quot;, Latin ablative for &quot;new&quot;. The Chinese name () means &quot;association&quot; (as in &quot;association of ideas&quot;), &quot;associative thinking&quot;, or &quot;connected thinking&quot;. It also implies creativity. &quot;Lianxiang&quot; was first used to refer to a layout of Chinese typewriters in the 1950s organized into groups of common words and phrases rather than the standard dictionary layout.

For the first 20 years of its existence, the company&#x27;s English name was &quot;Legend&quot;. In 2002, Yang Yuanqing decided to abandon the Legend English name to expand beyond the Chinese home market. &quot;Legend&quot; was already in use worldwide by many businesses, making it impossible to register in many jurisdictions outside China. In April 2003, the company publicly announced its new English name, &quot;Lenovo&quot;, with an advertising campaign including huge billboards and primetime television ads. Lenovo spent 18 million RMB on an eight-week television advertising campaign. The billboards showed the Lenovo logo against blue sky with a slogan that read, &quot;Transcendence depends on how you think.&quot; By the end of 2003, Lenovo had spent a total of 200 million RMB on rebranding.

==Products and services==
Lenovo is a manufacturer of personal computers, smartphones, televisions, and wearable devices. Some of the company&#x27;s earliest products included the KT8920 mainframe computer and a circuit board that allowed IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters. One of its first computers was the Tianxi (), released in 1998 in the Chinese market. It became the best selling computer in Chinese history in 2000.

===Personal and business computing===
Lenovo markets the ThinkPad, IdeaPad, Yoga, Legion and Xiaoxin (; Chinese market only) lines of laptops, as well as the IdeaCentre and ThinkCentre lines of desktops. It expanded significantly in 2005 through its acquisition of IBM&#x27;s personal computer business, including its ThinkPad and ThinkCentre lines. As of January 2013, shipments of THINK-branded computers have doubled since Lenovo&#x27;s takeover of the brand, with profit margins thought to be above 5%. Lenovo aggressively expanded the THINK brand away from traditional laptop computers in favor of tablets and hybrid devices such as the ThinkPad Tablet 2, ThinkPad Yoga, ThinkPad 8, ThinkPad Helix, and ThinkPad Twist; the shift came as a response to the growing popularity of mobile devices, and the release of Windows 8 in October 2012. Lenovo achieved significant success with this high-value strategy and in 2013 controlled more than 40% of the market for Windows computers priced above $900 in the United States.

====ThinkPad====
The ThinkPad is a line of business-oriented laptop known for their boxy black design, modeled after a traditional Japanese &quot;bento&quot;. The ThinkPad was originally an IBM product developed at the Yamato Facility in Japan by ; they have since been developed, manufactured and sold by both IBM and Lenovo after early 2005, following its acquisition of IBM&#x27;s personal computer division. The ThinkPad has been used in space and was the only laptop model certified for use on the International Space Station until 2016.

====ThinkCentre====

The ThinkCentre is a line of business-oriented desktop computers which was introduced in 2003 by IBM and since has been produced and sold by Lenovo since 2005. ThinkCentre computers typically include mid-range to high-end processors, options for discrete graphics cards, and multi-monitor support. Similar to the ThinkPad line of computers, there have been budget lines of ThinkCentre branded computers in the past. Some examples of this include: M55e series, A50 series, M72 series. These &quot;budget&quot; lines are typically &quot;thin clients&quot; however, meaning they are not standalone computers, rather, they are access points to a central server.

====ThinkServer, followed by ThinkSystem====

The ThinkServer product line began with the TS100 from Lenovo. The server was developed under an agreement with IBM, by which Lenovo would produce single-socket and dual-socket servers based on IBM&#x27;s xSeries technology. An additional feature of the server design was a support package aimed at small businesses. The focus of this support package was to provide small businesses with software tools to ease the process of server management and reduce dependence on IT support.

On 20 June 2017, Lenovo&#x27;s Data Center Group relaunched the ThinkServer product line as ThinkSystem, which consisted of 17 new machine type models, in the catalog formate containing form factors such as Tower, 1U/2U, Blades, Dense and 4U Mission Critical Intel-based servers. Also within this relaunch contained a portfolio of Storage Arrays and of Fibre Channel SAN Switches and Directors. To further incorporate industry-leading partnerships into its portfolio, Lenovo struck an agreement with the processor company, AMD, to be able to supply customers with a choice of options between both Intel and AMD powered appliances. In August, 2019, the first two ThinkSystem platforms were introduced to the market containing a single AMD EPYC processor, the SR635 (1U) and the SR655 (2U). Again, in May 2020, Lenovo DCG further expanded its AMD offerings to incorporate 2-proc systems, the SR645 and the SR665, continuing to exemplify its approach to being the Most Trusted Data Center Advisor in the market.

====ThinkStation====

Lenovo ThinkStations are workstations designed for high-end computing. In 2008, IBM/Lenovo expanded the focus of its THINK brand to include workstations, with the ThinkStation S10 being the first model released.

====ThinkVision====

High-end monitors are marketed under the ThinkVision name. ThinkVision displays share a common design language with other THINK devices such as the ThinkPad line of laptop computers and ThinkCentre line of desktop computers. At the 2014 International CES, Lenovo announced the ThinkVision Pro2840m, a 28-inch 4K display aimed at professionals. Lenovo also announced another 28-inch 4K touch-enabled device running Android that can function as an all-in-one PC or an external display for other devices.

At the 2016 International CES, Lenovo announced two displays with both USB-C and DisplayPort connectivity. The ThinkVision X24 Pro monitor is a 24-inch 1920 by 1080 pixel thin-bezel display that uses an IPS LCD panel. The ThinkVision X1 is a 27-inch 3840 by 2160 pixel thin-bezel display that uses a 10-bit panel with 99% coverage of the sRGB color gamut. The X24 includes a wireless charging base for mobile phones. The X1 is the first monitor to receive the TUV Eye-Comfort certification. Both monitors have HDMI 2.0 ports, support charging laptops, mobile phones, and other devices, and have Intel RealSense 3D cameras in order to support facial recognition. Both displays have dual-array microphones and 3-watt stereo speakers.

====IdeaPad====
The IdeaPad line of consumer-oriented laptops was introduced in January 2008. The IdeaPad is the result of Lenovo&#x27;s own research and development; Unlike the ThinkPad line, its design and branding were not inherited from IBM nor are they designed/developed by IBM.

The IdeaPad&#x27;s design language differs markedly from the ThinkPad and has a more consumer-focused look and feel.

On 21 September 2016, Lenovo confirmed that their Yoga series is not meant to be compatible with Linux operating systems, that they know it is impossible to install Linux on some models, and that it is not supported. This came in the wake of media coverage of problems that users were having while trying to install Ubuntu on several Yoga models, including the 900 ISK2, 900 ISK For Business, 900S, and 710, which were traced back to Lenovo disabling and removing support for the AHCI storage mode for the device&#x27;s Solid State Drive in the computer&#x27;s BIOS, in favor of a RAID mode that is only supported by Windows 10 drivers that come with the system. Lenovo has since released an alternative firmware that has restored the AHCI mode to the drive controller to allow installation of Linux operating systems.

====IdeaCentre====
All IdeaCentres are all-in-one machines, combining processor and monitor into a single unit. The desktops were described by HotHardware as being &quot;uniquely designed&quot;. The first IdeaCentre desktop, the IdeaCentre K210, was announced by Lenovo on 30 June 2008. While the IdeaCentre line consists only of desktops, it shares design elements and features with the IdeaPad line. One such feature was Veriface facial recognition technology.

At CES 2011, Lenovo announced the launch of four IdeaCentre desktops: the A320, B520, B320, and C205. In the autumn of 2012, the firm introduced the more powerful IdeaCentre A720, with a 27-inch touchscreen display and running Windows 8. With a TV tuner and HDMI in, the A720 can also serve as a multimedia hub or home theater PC.

In 2013, Lenovo added a table computer to the IdeaCentre line. The Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon, introduced at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show is a 27-inch touchscreen computer designed to lay flat for simultaneous use by multiple people. Thanks to its use of Windows 8, the Horizon can also serve as a desktop computer when set upright.

====Legion and LOQ====

Legion is a series of laptops and tablets from Lenovo targeting gaming performance. The first Legion brand laptops was revealed at CES 2017, the Legion Y520 and the Legion Y720. On 6 June 2017, a high-performance model, the Legion Y920, equipped with Intel&#x27;s seventh-generation quad-core i7-7820HK and Nvidia GTX 1070 discrete graphics, was launched.

At E3 2018, Lenovo announced three new laptops with new redesigned chassis, Y530, Y730 and Y7000.

In 2020, Lenovo launched Legion 3, 5, and 7, where Legion 7 is the highest specification of the series.

In 2021, Lenovo launched Legion 5 pro with AMD 5th series CPU and Nvidia 30s GPU.

In March 2023, Lenovo launched the LOQ gaming sub-brand which is aimed towards budget and new-to-gaming markets.

===Smartphones===
As of January 2013, Lenovo only manufactured phones that use the Android operating system from Google. Numerous press reports indicated that Lenovo planned to release a phone running Windows Phone 8, According to J. D. Howard, a vice president at Lenovo&#x27;s mobile division, the company would release a Windows Phone product if there is market demand.

Lenovo has implemented an aggressive strategy to replace Samsung Electronics as Mainland China market&#x27;s top smartphone vendor. It has spent $793.5 million in Wuhan in order to build a plant that can produce 30 to 40 million phones per year. Data from Analysys International shows that Lenovo experienced considerable growth in smartphone sales in China during 2012. Specifically, it saw its market share increase to 14.2% during 2012&#x27;s third quarter, representing an increase when compared to 4.8% in the same quarter of 2011. IDC analysts said that Lenovo&#x27;s success is due to its &quot;aggressive ramping-up and improvements in channel partnerships&quot;. Analysys International analyst Wang Ying wrote, &quot;Lenovo possesses an obvious advantage over rivals in terms of sales channels.&quot; The company&#x27;s CEO, Yang Yuanqing, said, &quot;Lenovo does not want to be the second player ... we want to be the best. Lenovo has the confidence to outperform Samsung and Apple, at least in the Chinese market.&quot;

According to IHS iSuppli, Lenovo was a top-three smartphone maker in China with a 16.5% market share in the first quarter of 2012. According to a May report released by IDC Lenovo ranks fourth in the global tablet market by volume. As of November 2012, Lenovo was the second largest seller of mobile phones in China when measured by volume.

In May 2013, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing indicated that the company had aimed to release smartphones in the United States within the next year. Later in October, Lenovo expressed interest in acquiring the Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry Limited. However, its attempt was reportedly blocked by the Government of Canada, citing security concerns due to the use of BlackBerry devices by prominent members of the government. An official stated that &quot;we have been pretty consistent that the message is Canada is open to foreign investment and investment from China in particular but not at the cost of compromising national security&quot;.

In January 2014, Lenovo announced a proposed deal to acquire Motorola Mobility to bolster its plans for the U.S. market. Microsoft officially announced that Lenovo had become the hardware partner of Windows Phone platform at the Mobile World Congress 2014. In January 2016, Lenovo announced at CES that the company would be producing the first Tango phone.

Lenovo plus Motorola was the 3rd largest producer of smartphones by volume in the world between 2011 and 2014. Since Lenovo&#x27;s acquisition of Motorola Mobility, the combined global market share of Lenovo plus Motorola has fallen from 7.2% in 2014 to 3.9% in the third quarter of 2016. A number of factors have been cited as the cause of this reduced demand, including the fact that Lenovo relied heavily on carriers to sell its phones, its phones lacked strong branding and unique features to distinguish them in the competitive Chinese market where a weak economy and saturated market is slowing demand and the culture clash between a more hierarchical PC company and the need to be nimble to sell rapidly-evolving smartphones. In response to the weak sales, Lenovo announced in August 2015 that it would lay off 3,200 employees, mostly in its Motorola smartphone business.

In the reorganization which followed, Lenovo was uncertain how to brand its Motorola smartphones. In November 2015, members of Lenovo management made statements that Lenovo would use the Motorola brand for all its smartphones. Then, in January 2016, Lenovo announced that it would be eliminating the Motorola brand in favor of &quot;Moto by Lenovo&quot;. The company reversed course in March 2017 and announced that the Motorola brand name would be used in all regions in future products. &quot;In 2016, we just finished transforming ourselves,&quot; Motorola Chairman and President Aymar de Lencquesaing said in an interview, &quot;We have clarity on how we present ourselves.&quot;

===Smart televisions===
In November 2011, Lenovo said it would soon unveil a Smart TV product called LeTV, expected for release in the first quarter of 2012. &quot;The PC, communications and TV industries are currently undergoing a &quot;smart&quot; transformation. In the future, users will have many smart devices and will desire an integrated experience of hardware, software and cloud services.&quot; Liu Jun, president of Lenovo&#x27;s mobile-Internet and digital-home-business division. In June 2013 Lenovo announced a partnership with Sharp to produce smart televisions. In March 2014, Lenovo announced that it projected smart television sales surpassing one million units for 2014. The same month Lenovo released its flagship S9 Smart TV.

===Wearables===

Rumors that Lenovo was developing a wearable device were confirmed in October 2014 after the company submitted a regulatory finding to the Federal Communications Commission. The device, branded a &quot;Smartband&quot;, has a battery life of seven days. It has an optical heart-rate monitor and can be used to track distance and time spent running and calories burned. It can also notify the user of incoming calls and texts. It can also unlock computers without the use of a password. The Smartband went on sale in October 2014. Lenovo started offering the device for sale on its website without a formal product announcement.

===IoT / Smart Home===
In 2015 Lenovo launched a strategic cooperation with IngDan (), a subsidiary of Chinese electronics e-commerce company Cogobuy Group, to penetrate into the intelligent hardware sector.  Lenovo wanted to procure High-Tech hardware in the then newly emerging Internet of Things (IoT) economy and formed a strategic partnership with Cogobuy in which it previously primarily bought IC components from. Cogobuy&#x27;s supply chain was utilized by Lenovo to procure consumer devices and bridge gaps in their proprietary hardware and software development. At the IFA 2018, Lenovo launched several Home automation products.

===Lenovo Connect===
At the Mobile World Congress in 2016, Lenovo introduced Lenovo Connect, a wireless roaming service. This service works across devices, networks, and borders for customers in China and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Lenovo Connect eliminates the need to buy new SIM cards when crossing borders. Lenovo Connect started service for phones and select ThinkPad laptops in China in February 2016.

==Operations==
Lenovo has operations in over 60 countries, and sells its products in around 180 countries. Lenovo&#x27;s principal facilities are in Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville, North Carolina, United States, with research centers in Beijing, Singapore, Morrisville, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chengdu, Nanjing, Wuhan and Yamato (Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan). Lenovo operates manufacturing facilities in Chengdu and Hefei in China, and in Japan. A global flagship opened in Beijing in February 2013.
Lenovo&#x27;s manufacturing operations are a departure from the usual industry practice of outsourcing to contract manufacturers. Lenovo instead focuses on vertical integration in order to avoid excessive reliance on original equipment manufacturers and to keep down costs. Speaking on this topic, Yang Yuanqing said, &quot;Selling PCs is like selling fresh fruit. The speed of innovation is very fast, so you must know how to keep up with the pace, control inventory, to match supply with demand and handle very fast turnover.&quot; Lenovo benefited from its vertical integration after flooding affected hard-drive manufacturers in Thailand in 2011, as the company could continue manufacturing operations by shifting production towards products for which hard drives were still available.

Lenovo began to emphasize vertical integration after a meeting in 2009 in which CEO Yang Yuanqing, and the head of Lenovo&#x27;s supply chain, analyzed the costs versus the benefits of in-house manufacturing, and decided to make at least 50% of Lenovo&#x27;s manufacturing in-house. Lenovo Chief Technology Officer George He said that vertical integration is having an important role in product development. He stated, &quot;If you look at the industry trends, most innovations for&quot; PCs, smartphones, tablets and smart TVs are related to innovation of key components—display, battery and storage. Differentiation of key parts is so important. So we started investing more ... and working very closely with key parts suppliers.&quot; Previously, lack of integration due to numerous foreign acquisitions and an excessive number of &quot;key performance indicators&quot; (KPIs) was making Lenovo&#x27;s expansion expensive and creating unacceptably slow delivery times to end-customers. Lenovo responded by reducing the number of KPIs from 150 to 5, offering intensive training to managers, and working to create a global Lenovo culture. Lenovo also doubled-down on vertical integration and manufacturing near target markets in order to cut costs at time when its competitors were making increased use of outsourcing offshoring. By 2013, Lenovo ranked 20th on Gartner&#x27;s list of top 50 supply chains, whereas in 2010 the company was unranked.

In 2012, Lenovo partially moved production of its ThinkPad line of computers to Japan. ThinkPads will be produced by NEC in Yamagata Prefecture. , president of Lenovo Japan, said, &quot;As a Japanese, I am glad to see the return to domestic production and the goal is to realize full-scale production as this will improve our image and make the products more acceptable to Japanese customers.&quot;

In October 2012, Lenovo announced that it would start assembling computers in Whitsett, North Carolina. Production of desktop and laptop computers, including the ThinkPad Helix began in January 2013. , 115 workers were employed at this facility. Lenovo has been in Whitsett since 2008, where it also has centers for logistics, customer service, and return processing.

In 2015, Lenovo and Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, a government-sponsored business park for technology firms, reached a deal to &quot;jointly build a cloud service and product research and development center&quot;. Lenovo&#x27;s Asia Pacific data center will also be housed in Cyperport.

Lenovo assembles smartphones in Chennai, India through a contract manufacturing agreement with Flex. In November 2015, Lenovo announced that it would start manufacturing computers in Pondicherry.

===Accusations of slave labor by supplier===
In August 2020, &quot;The Intercept&quot; reported that Lenovo imported about 258,000 laptops from the Chinese manufacturer Hefei Bitland Information Technology, a company, among others, accused by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute of using Uyghur forced labor. In July 2020, the United States Commerce Department added 11 companies, including Hefei Bitland, implicated in human rights abuses on the Entity List. Lenovo took some shipments out of the distribution, but other shipments were distributed to consumers.

In late July, Lenovo informed its customers it had stopped manufacturing with Bitland and was moving production of related devices to other suppliers.

==Corporate affairs==
===Business trends===
The key trends for Lenovo are (as of the financial year ending March 31):
===Headquarters===

Alongside Beijing, the company has operational centres in Lorong Chuan, Singapore, and Morrisville, North Carolina (near Raleigh in the Research Triangle metropolitan area) in the United States. As of October 2012, the Morrisville facility has about 2,000 employees. Lenovo identifies its facilities in Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville as its &quot;key location addresses&quot;, where its principal operations occur. The company&#x27;s registered office is on the 23rd floor of the Lincoln House building of the Taikoo Place in Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.

Previously the company&#x27;s U.S. headquarters were in Purchase, Harrison, New York. About 70 people worked there. In 2006, Lenovo announced that it was consolidating its U.S. headquarters, a logistics facility in Boulder, Colorado, and a call center in Atlanta, to a new facility in Morrisville. The company received offers of over $11 million in incentive funds from the local Morrisville, North Carolina, area and from the State of North Carolina on the condition that the company employs about 2,200 people. In early 2016, Lenovo carried out a comprehensive restructuring of its business units.

===Financials and market share===
In the third quarter of 2020, Lenovo commands a leading market share of 25.7 percent of all PCs sold in the world.

In March 2013, Lenovo was included as a constituent stock in the Hang Seng Index. Lenovo replaced the unprofitable Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, a state-owned enterprise, on the list of 50 key companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange that constitute the Hang Seng Index. The inclusion of Lenovo and Tencent, China&#x27;s largest internet firm, significantly increased the weight of the technology sector on the index. Being added to the Hang Seng Index was a significant boon for Lenovo and its shareholders as it widened the pool of investors willing to purchase Lenovo&#x27;s stock. For instance, index funds pegged to the Hang Seng and pension funds that consider index inclusion now have the opportunity to invest in Lenovo. In November 2013 Lenovo reported that they had achieved double-digit market share in the United States for the first time.

===Ownership===
In 2009, China Oceanwide Holdings Group, a private Investment company based in Beijing, bought 29% of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo, for ¥2.76 billion. , 65% of Lenovo stock was held by the general public, 29% by Legend Holdings, 5.8% by Yang Yuanqing, and 0.2% by other directors.

Responding to claims that Lenovo is a state-owned enterprise, CEO Yang Yuanqing said, &quot;Our company is a 100% market oriented company. Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It&#x27;s 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we&#x27;re different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.&quot;

As of 2014, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, owns 11.7% of Lenovo and IBM owns 37.8%.

In early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, &quot;We are not a government-controlled company.&quot; He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China&#x27;s transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment. The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo&#x27;s supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress.

Yang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 per cent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, &quot;While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company&#x27;s very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership – we do what we say, and we own what we do. My decision to increase my holdings represents my steadfast belief in these principles.&quot;

===Corporate culture===
Lenovo&#x27;s senior executives rotate between the three head offices at Beijing, Singapore, and Morrisville, as well as Lenovo&#x27;s research and development center in Yamato, Japan.

===Leadership===
====Yang Yuanqing====
Yang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo. One of his major achievements was leading Lenovo to become the best-selling personal computer brand in China since 1997. In 2001, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; named him one of Asia&#x27;s rising stars in business. Yang was president and CEO of Lenovo until 2004, when Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM&#x27;s PC division, after which Yang was succeeded as Lenovo CEO by IBM&#x27;s Stephen M. Ward Jr. Ward was succeeded by William Amelio on 20 December 2005. In February 2009, Yang replaced Amelio as CEO and has served in that capacity ever since. Yang was chairman of Lenovo&#x27;s board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.

In 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo&#x27;s employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, &quot;redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.&quot; Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight per cent of Lenovo&#x27;s stock, &quot;felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company&quot;. The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of or about . This was almost equivalent to a monthly salary of an average worker in China. Yang made a similar gift of again in 2013.

According to Lenovo&#x27;s annual report, Yang earned , including in bonuses, during the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.

In 2013, &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; named Yang one of the &quot;World&#x27;s Best CEOs&quot;.

====Liu Chuanzhi====

Liu Chuanzhi is the founder and former chairman of Lenovo. Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with &quot;The Economist&quot; he stated that &quot;Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.&quot; For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s distributor in China. In reference to Lenovo&#x27;s later acquisition of IBM&#x27;s personal computer unit Liu said, &quot;I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father&#x27;s and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.&quot;

====Board of directors====
In early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang to its board. Lenovo&#x27;s CEO Yang Yuanqing said, &quot;Jerry&#x27;s appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo&#x27;s reputation as a transparent international company.&quot; Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm ARM, was also appointed to Lenovo&#x27;s board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, &quot;We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.&quot;

==Marketing and sponsorships==
In 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo&#x27;s competitors have widely adopted the same approach In 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising.

===Celebrity sponsorships and endorsements===
In October 2013, Lenovo announced that it had hired American actor Ashton Kutcher as a product engineer and spokesman. David Roman, Lenovo&#x27;s chief marketing officer, said, &quot;His partnership goes beyond traditional bounds by deeply integrating him into our organization as a product engineer. Ashton will help us break new ground by challenging assumptions, bringing a new perspective and contributing his technical expertise to Yoga Tablet and other devices.&quot; Kobe Bryant became an official ambassador for Lenovo smartphones in China and Southeast Asia in early 2013. Bryant appeared in a social campaign titled &quot;The Everyday Kobe Challenge&quot; for the launch of Lenovo IdeaPhone K900 in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines in the same year.

===Sporting sponsorship===

Lenovo was an official computer sponsor of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. When asked about Lenovo&#x27;s brand Yang Yuanqing said, &quot;The Beijing Olympics were very good for brand awareness in countries like the US and Argentina, but not good enough.&quot; The NFL has been a Lenovo customer since 2007. In July 2012, Lenovo and the National Football League (NFL) announced that Lenovo had become the NFL&#x27;s &quot;Official Laptop, Desktop and Workstation Sponsor.&quot; Lenovo said that this was its largest sponsorship deal ever in the United States. NFL stars Jerry Rice, DeAngelo Williams, and Torry Holt were on hand for the announcement and a celebration with 1,500 Lenovo employees. Lenovo&#x27;s sponsorship will last at least three years.

Lenovo is a technology partner of Ducati Corse in Grand Prix motorcycle racing since 2018. For the 2021 MotoGP it will become main sponsor for the Bolognese.

Lenovo is also an official partner of the NHL&#x27;s Carolina Hurricanes who play in nearby Raleigh, North Carolina. In 2024, Lenovo bought the naming rights to the their arena, renaming it Lenovo Center.

Lenovo and FC Internazionale, in 2019, have signed a multi-year sponsorship agreement that makes Lenovo the Global Technology Partner of the Nerazzurri company. In May 2021, Lenovo and Motorola Mobility decided to celebrate with a limited edition of Motorola Razr totally customized and produced in 2021 numbered pieces, to honor Inter who won their 19th Scudetto. In July 2021 there was the launch of the new Inter Home shirt for the 2021–22 season, they unveiled the introduction of Lenovo as a sponsor on the back of the shirt. In October 2024, Lenovo was named the official technology partner of FIFA.

===Television, internet, and other media===
Lenovo used a short-film entitled &quot;The Pursuit&quot; in its &quot;For Those Who Do&quot; campaign launched in 2011. The film depicted a mysterious young woman using the IdeaPad Yoga 13 to stay one-step-ahead of her evil pursuers. Martin Campbell, who previously worked on action movies and James Bond films such as GoldenEye and the remake of Casino Royale, shot this film. Lenovo was the first Chinese company to make use of such marketing techniques.

In May 2015, Lenovo hosted its first ever &quot;Tech World&quot; conference in Beijing. ZUK Mobile, a separate company formed by Lenovo in 2014, announced several products at Tech World. These included slim power banks, 3D printers that can print food such as chocolate, an outdoor sound box, and a Wi-Fi based control system for home automation.

===China===
In its home market China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.

As of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by former premier Li Keqiang will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo&#x27;s annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: &quot;I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.&quot; Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by China&#x27;s relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government&#x27;s rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.

===India===
Lenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of Tamil Nadu ordered a million ThinkPads from IBM/Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as Ingram Micro and Redington.

Given that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo&#x27;s managing director for India, said, &quot;To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area.&quot; As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.

Lenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15–20% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in Gujarat and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo&#x27;s strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones. Lenovo has also partnered with HCL in order to set up 250 service centers in 110 cities.

In India, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain market intelligence and speed up product development.

Lenovo reported a year-on-year increase of about 951% in tablet sales in India for the first quarter of 2014. Canalys, a market research firm, said Lenovo took market share away from Apple and Samsung in the country.

===Africa===
Lenovo first started doing business in South Africa, establishing a sales office, and then expanded to East African markets such as Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Rwanda. West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana.

According to Lenovo&#x27;s general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo&#x27;s strategy is to put &quot;great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa&quot; and roll out &quot;products alongside different African governments&#x27; rolling out of wireless technology&quot;. Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply. Other popular products include the Lenovo netbooks, which were introduced in 2008.

Lenovo picked Nigeria in 2013 to release its smartphone because unlike South Africa and other African countries, there is no requirement to partner with a local telecom firm to sell its phones.

In the long term, according to Braum, &quot;Lenovo in Africa will focus on continuing to consistently supply personal computer products and allow this market to grow, while moving into new territory such as mobile and enterprise.&quot;

===Singapore===
Lenovo has had a presence in Singapore as early as its foundation, and with a focus on the Southeast Asia region, it is the location of one of Lenovo&#x27;s three head offices. Registered as Lenovo (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., it is located at the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district of the North-East Region of Singapore.

===United States===
In the United States, Lenovo began the &quot;For Those Who Do&quot; marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. It was part of Lenovo&#x27;s first-ever global branding campaign, beyond its domestic market in China. &quot;For Those Who Do&quot; was designed to appeal to young consumers in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic by stressing its utility to creative individuals that Lenovo&#x27;s advertising refers to as &quot;doers&quot;. One of Lenovo&#x27;s operational centers is located in North Carolina, United States. Lenovo also started manufacturing products in the United States in 2012.

===Goodweird===
Lenovo launched a multi-year advertising campaign called &quot;Goodweird&quot; in the last half of 2015. Goodweird is designed to convey the idea that designs that seem strange initially often become familiar and widely accepted. The Goodweird campaign includes a video with famous images of early attempts to fly with the aid of homemade wings and a bicycle that transitions to a modern-day shot of a man soaring across mountains in a wingsuit before transitioning again to a shot of the Stealth Bomber. Lenovo worked with three agencies on Goodweird: London-based DLKW Low, We Are Social, and Blast Radius. Goodweird is part of Lenovo&#x27;s wider strategy to appeal to millennials with an emphasis on design trendsetters. A portion of the funding for Goodweird is being directed to prominent YouTubers and Viners. BuzzFeed has been engaged to create relevant content.

==Security and privacy incidents==
===Superfish===
In February 2015, Lenovo became the subject of controversy for having bundled software identified as malware on some of its laptops. The software, Superfish Visual Discovery, is a web browser add-on that injects Pricing advertising into search engine results pages. To intercept HTTPS-encrypted communications, the software also installed a self-signed public key certificate. When the Superfish public-key cryptography was compromised, it was also discovered that the same private key was used across all installations of the software, leaving users vulnerable to security exploits utilizing the key. Lenovo made between on its deal with Superfish. In 2017 Lenovo agreed to pay as part of a settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission. and announced an apology to its customers and stockholders.

The head of Superfish responded to security concerns by saying the vulnerability was &quot;inadvertently&quot; introduced by Komodia, which built the application. In response to the criticism, Lenovo detailed that it would cease further distribution and use of the Superfish software, and offered affected customers free six-month subscriptions to the McAfee LiveSafe software. Lenovo issued a promise to reduce the amount of &quot;Software bloat&quot; it bundles with its Windows 10 devices, promising to only include Lenovo software, security software, drivers, and &quot;certain applications customarily expected by users&quot;. &quot;Salon&quot; tech writer David Auerbach compared the Superfish incident to the Sony DRM rootkit scandal, and argued that &quot;installing Superfish is one of the most irresponsible mistakes an established tech company has ever made.&quot;

===Lenovo Service Engine===
From October 2014 through June 2015, the UEFI firmware on certain Lenovo models had contained software known as &quot;Lenovo Service Engine&quot;, which Lenovo says automatically sent non-identifiable system information to Lenovo the first time Windows is connected to the internet, and on laptops, automatically installs the Lenovo OneKey Optimizer program (software considered to be Software bloat) as well. This process occurs even on clean installations of Windows. It was found that this program had been automatically installed using a new feature in Windows 8, Windows Platform Binary Table, which allows executable files to be stored within UEFI firmware for execution on startup, and is meant to &quot;allow critical software to persist even when the operating system has changed or been reinstalled in a &quot;clean&quot; configuration&quot;; specifically, anti-theft security software. The software was discontinued after it was found that aspects of the software had security vulnerabilities, and did not comply with revised guidelines for appropriate usage of WPBT. On 31 July 2015, Lenovo released instructions and UEFI firmware updates meant to remove Lenovo Service Engine.

===Lenovo Customer Feedback program===
At a third time in 2015, criticism arose that Lenovo might have installed software that looked suspicious on their commercial Think-PC lines. This was discovered by Computerworld writer Michael Horowitz, who had purchased several Think systems with the Customer Feedback program installed, which seemed to log usage data and metrics. Further analysis by Horowitz revealed however that this was mostly harmless, as it was only logging the usage of some pre-installed Lenovo programs, and not the usage in general, and only if the user allowed the data to be collected. Horowitz also criticized other media for quoting his original article and saying that Lenovo preinstalled spyware, as he himself never used that term in this case and he also said that he does not consider the software he found to be spyware.

===Lenovo Accelerator===
As of June 2016, a Duo Labs report stated that Lenovo was still installing bloatware, some of which leads to security vulnerabilities as soon as the user turns on their new PC. Lenovo advised users to remove the offending app, &quot;Lenovo Accelerator&quot;. According to Lenovo, the app, designed to &quot;speed up the loading&quot; of Lenovo applications, created a man-in-the-middle security vulnerability.

===U.S. Marine network security breach===
In February 2021, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; reported that U.S. investigators found in 2008 that military units in Iraq were using Lenovo laptops in which the hardware had been altered. According to a testimony from the case in 2010, &quot;A large amount of Lenovo laptops were sold to the U.S. military that had a chip encrypted on the motherboard that would record all the data that was being inputted into that laptop and send it back to China&quot;. Lenovo was unaware of the testimony and the U.S. military did not inform the company of any security concerns. A Lenovo spokesperson stated that &quot;we have no way to assess the allegations you cite or whether security concerns may have been triggered by third-party interference.&quot;

<text>Hazen Street (also typeset Hazen St.) is an American supergroup that formed in early 2004. The band features Freddy Cricien and Hoya Roc (Madball); Toby Morse (H2O), David Kennedy (Box Car Racer, Over My Dead Body, later Angels &amp; Airwaves), and Mackie (Cro-Mags &amp; Bad Brains). Chad Gilbert (Shai Hulud and later New Found Glory) co-wrote and helped record every song on the album, but he was soon dismissed from Hazen Street by New Found Glory&#x27;s record label due to a contract dispute. He was replaced by Brian &quot;Mitts&quot; Daniels of Madball.

== History ==
In March 2004, the band performed at the ExtremeThing festival. In April and May 2004, the group supported Story of the Year on their headlining US tour. Hazen Street released their self-titled debut album, Hazen Street on Joel and Benji Madden&#x27;s DC Flag Records. On August 31, 2005, the band posted an update on their website, reporting that they would begin to work on a new record at the end of 2005, label to be announced. However, there has been no website updates since then, and nothing has been heard regarding this new album, presumably due to Kennedy&#x27;s full-time involvement with Angels &amp; Airwaves.

In November 2006, it was announced that their song &quot;Are You Ready?&quot; would be the official theme song for WWE Survivor Series 2006, the twentieth annual Survival Series pay-per-view. The event took place at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia on November 26, 2006.

Hazen Street reunited for a one-off performance on June 21, 2009, supporting H2O in a show in New York City.

Hazen Street again reunited to perform at The East Coast Tsunami Fest 2011, a Hardcore/Punk /Metal festival that took place in Reading, Pennsylvania.

In 2012, Hazen Street performed at the Groezrock festival in Belgium. The band is set to do a performance with Rancid and several other acts in New York City.

Together with Madball and H2O, Hazen Street was part of the Rebellion Tour 2023, playing shows all over Europe.

<doc id="997205" wikidata="Q2261398" url="?curid=997205" title="Circular orbit">
<text>A circular orbit is an orbit with a fixed distance around the barycenter; that is, in the shape of a circle.
In this case, not only the distance, but also the speed, angular speed, potential and kinetic energy are constant. There is no periapsis or apoapsis. This orbit has no radial version.

Listed below is a circular orbit in astrodynamics or celestial mechanics under standard assumptions. Here the centripetal force is the gravitational force, and the axis mentioned above is the line through the center of the central mass perpendicular to the orbital plane.

==Circular acceleration==
Transverse acceleration (perpendicular to velocity) causes a change in direction. If it is constant in magnitude and changing in direction with the velocity, circular motion ensues. Taking two derivatives of the particle&#x27;s coordinates concerning time gives the centripetal acceleration

:formula_1

where:
*formula_2 is the orbital velocity of the orbiting body,
*formula_3 is radius of the circle
*formula_4 is angular speed, measured in radians per unit time.
The formula is dimensionless, describing a ratio true for all units of measure applied uniformly across the formula. If the numerical value formula_5 is measured in meters per second squared, then the numerical values formula_2 will be in meters per second, formula_3 in meters, and formula_4 in radians per second.

==Velocity==
The speed (or the magnitude of velocity) relative to the centre of mass is constant:
:formula_9
where:
* formula_10, is the gravitational constant
* formula_11, is the mass of both orbiting bodies formula_12, although in common practice, if the greater mass is significantly larger, the lesser mass is often neglected, with minimal change in the result.
*formula_13, is the standard gravitational parameter.
*formula_14 is the distance from the center of mass.

==Equation of motion==
The orbit equation in polar coordinates, which in general gives &quot;r&quot; in terms of &quot;θ&quot;, reduces to:
:formula_15
where:
*formula_16 is specific angular momentum of the orbiting body.

This is because formula_17

==Angular speed and orbital period==

:formula_18

Hence the orbital period (formula_19) can be computed as:
:formula_20

Compare two proportional quantities, the free-fall time (time to fall to a point mass from rest)

:formula_21 (17.7% of the orbital period in a circular orbit)

and the time to fall to a point mass in a radial parabolic orbit

:formula_22 (7.5% of the orbital period in a circular orbit)

The fact that the formulas only differ by a constant factor is a priori clear from dimensional analysis.

==Energy==
The specific orbital energy (formula_23) is negative, and
:formula_24
:formula_25

Thus the virial theorem applies even without taking a time-average:

*the kinetic energy of the system is equal to the absolute value of the total energy
*the potential energy of the system is equal to twice the total energy

The escape velocity from any distance is times the speed in a circular orbit at that distance: the kinetic energy is twice as much, hence the total energy is zero.

==Delta-v to reach a circular orbit==
Maneuvering into a large circular orbit, e.g. a geostationary orbit, requires a larger delta-v than an escape orbit, although the latter implies getting arbitrarily far away and having more energy than needed for the orbital speed of the circular orbit. It is also a matter of maneuvering into the orbit. See also Hohmann transfer orbit.

== Orbital velocity in general relativity ==
In Schwarzschild metric, the orbital velocity for a circular orbit with radius formula_14 is given by the following formula:
:formula_27
where formula_28 is the Schwarzschild radius of the central body.

=== Derivation ===
For the sake of convenience, the derivation will be written in units in which formula_29.

The four-velocity of a body on a circular orbit is given by:
:formula_30
(formula_31 is constant on a circular orbit, and the coordinates can be chosen so that formula_32). The dot above a variable denotes derivation with respect to proper time formula_33.

For a massive particle, the components of the four-velocity satisfy the following equation:
:formula_34

We use the geodesic equation:
:formula_35
The only nontrivial equation is the one for formula_36. It gives:
:formula_37
From this, we get:
:formula_38
Substituting this into the equation for a massive particle gives:
:formula_39
Hence:
:formula_40

Assume we have an observer at radius formula_31, who is not moving with respect to the central body, that is, their four-velocity is proportional to the vector formula_42. The normalization condition implies that it is equal to:
:formula_43
The dot product of the four-velocities of the observer and the orbiting body equals the gamma factor for the orbiting body relative to the observer, hence:
:formula_44
This gives the velocity:
:formula_45
Or, in SI units:
:formula_27

<text>Hello Brother is a 1999 Indian Hindi-language romantic fantasy comedy action film written and directed by Sohail Khan. It stars Khan&#x27;s real-life elder brothers Salman Khan and Arbaaz Khan with Rani Mukerji and Shakti Kapoor. The film is an adaptation of 1992 Malayalam film &quot;Aayushkalam&quot; (itself adapted from the 1990 American films &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Heart Condition&quot;).

== Plot ==
Hero (Salman Khan) works for a courier company owned by Khanna (Shakti Kapoor). He is spirited and humorous and is in love with Rani (Rani Mukerji) but she simply thinks of Hero as a very good friend. as Inspector Vishal (Arbaaz Khan) who works in the narcotics department. Vishal, who is stationed at a different Police Department, transfers to Mumbai from Goa. Vishal suspects Khanna to be involved in a drug ring and confronts him. Hero stands up to Vishal and defends his boss, but soon learns the truth behind Khanna. In a confrontation, Hero is shot dead by Khanna and shoots Vishal in the heart. The police department decides to transplant Hero&#x27;s heart into Vishal&#x27;s body.

Hero appears as a ghost now and can only be seen by Vishal, since his heart is in Vishal&#x27;s body. Hero says that he will only rest in peace after Khanna is killed, thus avenging him. Vishal decides to go about doing this, and Rani and Vishal begin to fall in love with each other. Hero dislikes this and tries to foil Vishal&#x27;s plans of getting close to Rani. But Hero and Vishal start getting closer and work together, becoming good friends after Vishal confronts Khanna&#x27;s drug company.

Khanna arranges to leave the country but kidnaps Rani. Vishal and Hero go to save Rani and fight off Khanna&#x27;s henchmen, but Vishal gets injured. Hero then goes inside him and controls his fighting moves, helping him to beat the thugs. Rani witnesses this and realizes that only Hero could perform such moves. She calls out Hero&#x27;s name, though Vishal does not know that Hero is inside him. Khanna shoots Vishal. Hero takes Vishal&#x27;s hand and shoots Khanna with the gun.

Khanna finally dies, and as Rani is comforting Vishal, he tells her that Hero is with them and he loves Rani. Rani then tells Vishal to tell Hero that she loves Him. Khanna&#x27;s ghost rises from his dead body and Hero hits him. Khanna is taken to Hell and Hero is taken to Heaven.

Afterward, Rani and Vishal have gotten married and are spending their wedding night and honeymoon in a house on the water. It is shown that Hero, now an angel, is happily watching over them from Heaven.They then lived happily ever after .

Suparn Verma of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; wrote that &quot;Hello Brother is a loud, garish film; it is funny, if you have an appetite for such fare&quot;.

The film was dubbed and released in Telugu under the same name later that year, despite a 1994 Telugu film with the same name was already released.

<text>Victor Brauner (, also spelled Viktor Brauner; 15 June 1903 – 12 March 1966) was a Romanian painter and sculptor of the surrealist movement.

==Early life==
He was born in Piatra Neamț, Romania, the son of a Jewish timber manufacturer who subsequently settled in Vienna with his family for a few years. It is there that young Victor attended elementary school. When his family returned to Romania in 1914, he continued his studies at the Lutheran school in Brăila. His interests revolved around zoology during that period.

He attended the National School of Fine Arts in Bucharest (1916–1918) and Horia Igiroșanu private school of painting. He visited Fălticeni and Balcic, and started painting landscapes in the manner of Paul Cézanne. Then, as he testified himself, he went through all the stages: &quot;Dadaist, Abstractionist, Expressionist&quot;.

On 26 September 1924, the Mozart Galleries in Bucharest hosted his first personal exhibition. In that period he met poet Ilarie Voronca, together with whom he founded the &quot;75HP&quot; magazine. It was in this magazine that Brauner published the manifesto &quot;The Pictopoetry&quot; and the article &quot;The Surrationalism&quot;. He painted and exhibited &quot;Christ at the Cabaret&quot; (in the manner of George Grosz) and &quot;The Girl in the Factory&quot; (in the manner of Ferdinand Hodler). He participated to the &quot;Contimporanul&quot; exhibition in November 1924.

In 1925, he undertook his first journey to Paris, from where he returned in 1927. In the period 1928–1931 he was a contributor of the &quot;unu&quot; magazine (an avant-garde periodical with Dadaist and Surrealist tendencies), which published reproductions of most of his paintings and graphic works: &quot;clear drawings and portraits made by Victor Brauner to his friends, poets and writers&quot; (Jaques Lessaigne – &quot;Painters I Knew&quot;).

In 1930, he settled in Paris, where he met Constantin Brâncuși, who instructed him in methods of art photography. In that same period he became a friend of the Romanian poet Benjamin Fondane and met Yves Tanguy, who would later introduce him to the circle of the Surrealists. He lived on Moulin Vert Street, in the same building as Alberto Giacometti and Tanguy. He painted &quot;Self-portrait with enucleated eye&quot;, a premonitory theme.

In 1934 André Breton wrote an introduction to the catalogue for Brauner&#x27;s first Parisian solo exhibition at the Pierre Gallery. The theme of the eye was omnipresent: &quot;Mr. K&#x27;s power of concentration&quot; and &quot;The strange case of Mr. K&quot; are paintings that Breton compared with Alfred Jarry’s play &quot;Ubu Roi&quot;, &quot;a huge, caricature-like satire of the bourgeoisie&quot;.

In 1935, Brauner returned to Bucharest. He joined the ranks of the Romanian Communist Party for a short while, without a very firm conviction, but campaigned for the party with the surrealists Mary Stanley Low and Juan Ramón Breá when they visited him. On 7 April 1935, he opened a new personal exhibition at the Mozart Galleries. Sașa Pană wrote about it in his autobiographical novel, &quot;Born in 02&quot;:

The catalogue shows 16 paintings; they are accompanied by verse, surrealist images that are exquisite by their bizarreness – they are perhaps the creations of automatic dictation and they certainly bear no connection to the painting itself. They are written in French, but their colorful taste is kept in their Romanian language translation. The exhibition brought about many interesting articles and takings of position regarding Surrealism in arts and literature.

Another remark about Brauner&#x27;s participation to Surrealist exhibitions: &quot;Despite its appearance of abstract formula … this trend is a point of transition to the art that is to come&quot; (Dolfi Trost, in &quot;Rampa&quot; of 14 April 1935). In &quot;Cuvântul liber&quot; of 20 April 1935, Miron Radu Paraschivescu wrote in the article &quot;Victor Brauner’s exhibition&quot;: &quot;In contrast to what one may see, for instance, in the neighboring exhibition halls, Victor Brauner’s painting means integration, an attitude that is a social one, as far as art allows it. For V. Brauner takes attitude through the very character and ideology of his art&quot;. On 27 April, he created the illustrations for Gellu Naum’s poetry collections – &quot;The Incendiary Traveler&quot; and &quot;The Freedom to Sleep on the Forehead&quot;.

==Exiles==
In 1938, he returned to France. On 28 August, he lost his left eye in a violent argument between Oscar Domínguez and Esteban Francés. Brauner attempted to protect Esteban and was hit by a glass thrown by Domínguez: the premonition became true.

That same year, he met Jaqueline Abraham, who was to become his wife. He created a series of paintings called &quot;lycanthropic&quot; or sometimes &quot;chimeras&quot;.

He left Paris during Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of France in 1940, together with Pierre Mabille. He lived for a while in Perpignan, at Robert Rius&#x27;, then at Canet-plage, in the Eastern Pyrenees and at Saint-Féliu-d&#x27;Amont, where he was forcibly secluded. However, he kept in touch with the Surrealists who had taken refuge in Marseille. In 1941, he was granted the permission to settle in Marseille. Seriously ill, he was hospitalized at the &quot;Paradis&quot; clinic.

He painted &quot;Prelude to a civilization&quot; in 1954, now in New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art. The painting is in encaustic on Masonite. After the war, he took part in the Venice Biennale, and traveled to Italy.

In 1959, he settled in a studio at 72, rue Lepic, in Montmartre. In 1961, he traveled to Italy again. In the same year, New York City&#x27;s Bodley Gallery mounted a solo exhibition of Brauner&#x27;s work. He settled in Varengeville in Normandy, where he spent most of his time working.

In 1965, he created an ensemble of object-paintings, grouped under the titles &quot;Mythologie&quot; and &quot;Fêtes des mères&quot;. These paintings were made in Varengeville and in Athanor in 1964, where Brauner retreated. His last painting, &quot;La fin et le début&quot; (made in 1965), reminds us that &quot;when the painter&#x27;s life ends, his work starts living&quot;.

In 1966, he was chosen to represent France at the Venice Biennale, where an entire hall was dedicated to him.
He died in Paris as a result of a prolonged illness. The epitaph on his tomb from Montmartre Cemetery is a phrase from his notebooks: &quot;Peindre, c&#x27;est la vie, la vraie vie, ma vie&quot; (&quot;Painting is life, real life, my life&quot;).

The painter&#x27;s notebooks with private notes, which he handed to Max Pol Fouchet, partly enclose the &quot;key&quot; of his creation: &quot;Each painting that I make is projected from the deepest sources of my anxiety...&quot;

Victor Brauner&#x27;s brother, Harry Brauner, was a folklorist who later married Lena Constante.

==Collections==

<text>Almada () is a city and a municipality in Portugal, located on the southern margin of the Tagus River, on the opposite side of the river from Lisbon. The two cities are connected by the 25 de Abril Bridge. The population of the municipality in 2011 was 174,030, in an area of 70.21 km2. The urbanized core center, the city of Almada proper, had a population of 101,500 in 2001. It makes part of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area.

==History==
Human presence in the area of Almada dates to the end of the Neolithic period about 5000 years ago; archeological excavations performed in the municipality suggest that non-sedentary nomadic tribes may have occupied this location sporadically. The gradual development of settlement here made its greatest advance with the coming of Islamic civilization, when Muslims constructed a fort at Almada to defend and monitor the entrance to the Tagus River. Lying across the river from Lisbon, the area of Almada was a crossroads for a succession of various peoples who traded along the Tagus, including Phoenicians, Romans and Moors.

As one of the principal Arab military bases along the southern margin of the Tagus, Almada was conquered by the Christian forces of Afonso I with the aid of English Crusaders in 1147. Alongside these Christians there lived many free Moors and Jews, under the royal protection guaranteed them by Afonso I in the charter of 1170 (which applied to all the former Moorish strongholds at Lisbon, Almada, Palmela and Alcácer).

Almada received a foral from King Sancho I in 1190, although it came at a price: Miramolim Jacub-Abu-Jassuf, son of the Moorish leader who had laid siege to Santarém in 1171, was angered by the Christian victories and gathered a large army. He boldly attacked in the north, conquering Alcácer do Sal and Silves, while forcing the residents of Almada, Palmela and other towns along the Tagus into hiding. It would be some time after the death of Sancho before this region would be restored to Portuguese control.
When this event occurred with the success of the Reconquista in driving the Muslims out, the Order of Santiago, a donatorio of Almada after 28 October 1186, had an important role in the territory (especially between the Tagus and Sado Rivers). In this role, it facilitated the repopulation of acquired territories and was the beneficiary of the various local economies.

==Geography==

Although small in area, the city of Almada has a large population. It is bounded to the southeast by Seixal, to the south by Sesimbra, to the west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and northeast by the Tagus River. At Cacilhas, its main port, ferry boats transport visitors and local residents across to Lisbon daily, while the 25 de Abril Bridge, which spans the Tagus, is traversed by rail, commercial and personal vehicles daily. Almada is considered a transportation hub and a fast-growing suburb; its coast has several sandy beaches and panoramic vistas.

Located in the district of Setúbal, the municipality includes two cities, Almada and Costa da Caparica, and is divided into five civil parishes:
* Almada, Cova da Piedade, Pragal e Cacilhas
* Caparica e Trafaria
* Charneca de Caparica e Sobreda
* Costa da Caparica
* Laranjeiro e Feijó

==Demographics==
==Transportaion==

The 25 de Abril Bridge links Lisbon and Almada, which are on opposite sides of the Tagus river. The municipality is served by a light-rail transit system, the Metro Transportes do Sul, linking it to the suburban rail system (Fertagus) serving Greater Lisbon and the municipality of Seixal.

<text>Adventure Game Studio (AGS) is an open source development tool primarily used to create graphic adventure games. It is aimed at intermediate-level game designers, and combines an integrated development environment (IDE) with a scripting language based on the C programming language to process game logic.

==History==
Adventure Game Studio was created by British programmer Chris Jones in 1997 as an MS-DOS program entitled &quot;Adventure Creator&quot;. Jones was inspired by Sierra On-Line&#x27;s adventure game interface, specifically as showcased in &quot;Space Quest IV&quot;. The first version of Adventure Creator allowed users to create only low-resolution keyboard-controlled games.

&quot;Lassi Quest&quot; was released as the first complete AGS game in late 1999. The engine gained popularity with the release of Ben &quot;Yahtzee&quot; Croshaw&#x27;s &quot;Rob Blanc&quot; and Philip Reed&#x27;s &quot;Larry Vales&quot; games in 2000-2001. 

Version 3.0 in January 2008 included a complete rewrite of the editor using the .NET Framework and an update to the game engine to support 3D hardware acceleration.

On 26 October 2010, Chris Jones released the source code for the editor under the terms of the Artistic License, version 2. On 27 April 2011, the runtime engine code was released under the same licence.

By 2015, community developers were maintaining and improving the engine and IDE, and began to implement cross-platform capabilities as well as support for more modern screen resolutions (4:3, 16:9 and custom high resolutions).

==Capabilities==
The editor and runtime engine were originally designed for Microsoft Windows operating systems; the runtime engine was ported to Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS X and PlayStation Portable after the release of the source code. Prior to AGS 2.7, an MS-DOS engine was also available; this has since been discontinued. It is not yet possible to run the editor on operating systems other than Windows without an emulator or API wrapper such as Wine.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki GNU/linux&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

AGS can create games with a graphical range from 256 colours and a resolution of 320×200, to truecolor games with any higher resolution supported by the player&#x27;s graphic adapter and an alpha channel. It also supports graphics filters: nearest-neighbor interpolation (2x, 3x, and 4x), and hqx (2x and 3x). Version 2.61 supports the following multimedia formats: mod, wav, xm, MIDI, ogg, mp3, avi. Version 2.72 also supports Impulse Tracker and S3M.

==Community==
The AGS community is based on the AGS Forum, the AGS Internet Relay Chat channel and Discord channel. There are real-world meetings of the community each year, known as &quot;Mittens&quot;.

==AGS Awards==
The AGS Awards were founded in 2001 and are awarded annually to the best games created with AGS, in multiple categories. The AGS Awards were once an important barometer for indie adventure games, receiving coverage from sites like &quot;Destructoid&quot;, &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot;, &quot;IndieGames&quot; and &quot;GameSetWatch&quot;.

==Reception and usage ==
Thousands of games have been produced using AGS, among them commercially successful games such as &quot;Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman&#x27;s Mine&quot;, &quot;The Cat Lady&quot;, or &quot;The Journey Down&quot;.

Wadjet Eye Games is an indie game developer that has created most of its commercial titles using AGS, such as the &quot;Blackwell&quot; series of games. They also publish AGS games by other developers, such as &quot;Primordia&quot; by Wormwood Studios, &quot;Resonance&quot; by XII Games, and &quot;Gemini Rue&quot; by Joshua Nuernberger.

Development teams AGD Interactive and Infamous Adventures have remade and updated &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; and other Sierra releases. LucasFan Games have done the same with LucasArts adventure games.

<text>Manuel Mendes (or Manoel Mendes; c. 1547 – 24 September 1605) was a Portuguese composer and teacher of the Renaissance. While his music remains obscure, he was important as the teacher of several of the composers of the golden age of Portuguese polyphony, including Duarte Lobo and Manuel Cardoso.

He was born in Lisbon, and studied music with Cosme Delgado in Évora as a youth. Later he was appointed &quot;mestre de capela&quot; at the cathedral in Portalegre, but returned to Évora to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1575. In 1575 he became a priest and teacher of the choirboys in the cathedral. His students included some of the most famous Portuguese composers of the early 17th century, such as Duarte Lobo, Manuel Cardoso, Filipe de Magalhães and Manuel Rebelo. He died at Évora.

While Mendes was evidently a prolific composer, his works are only extant in manuscript. He was famous in the 16th century, and his music traveled to Spain as well as Mexico, where he was highly regarded.

<doc id="997248" wikidata="Q66674" url="?curid=997248" title="Anton Schwarzkopf">
<text>Anton Schwarzkopf (8 July 1924 – 30 July 2001) was a German engineer who founded Schwarzkopf Industries GmbH, a German manufacturer of roller coasters and other amusement rides that were sold to amusement parks and travelling funfairs around the world.

==Early years==
Anton Schwarzkopf, born in Bahlingen, Germany, began as an apprentice in his father&#x27;s business, which focused on the design of specialised trailers used to transport circus equipment. By 1954, his father&#x27;s company had transitioned into creating amusement rides.

==Career==
In 1957, Schwarzkopf built his first attraction, the Düsenspirale, which was a roller coaster that traveled around Germany with funfair showman Löffelhardt. He took over his father&#x27;s company in 1960 and created his first full-scale steel roller coaster, The Wildcat, in 1964. In 1970, the first Jet Star II model was built for German showman Rick. The model became popular for its electric spiral lift hill, and many of this type were built. In 1976, Schwarzkopf partnered with ride engineer Werner Stengel to create a ground-breaking attraction, the Revolution roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California. It was the first roller coaster in the modern era to feature a vertical loop. The vertical loop became a signature element used in many of Schwarzkopf&#x27;s designs, including King Kobra at Kings Dominion in 1977, one of the first Shuttle Loop designs, and Shock Wave at Six Flags Over Texas in 1978, which featured consecutive vertical loops.
Schwarzkopf Industries GmbH experienced rapid growth throughout the 1970s, as its rides were well received and in high demand. In the 1980s, the company produced several transportable rides for travelling funfairs, particularly those in Western Europe, with a notable example being the Alpina Bahn in 1983. Dreier Looping (meaning triple loop in English) was built in 1984, and Thriller was built in 1986. Outside of Germany, the company partnered with Intamin, and many older rides credited to Intamin were actually designed and created by Schwarzkopf. Schwarzkopf suffered several business setbacks and suffered through several bankruptcies, with the first occurring in late 1983, leading to the abandonment of several upcoming designs and installations. While dormant during the mid-1980s, Peißenberg and Zierer stepped in to construct several of Schwarzkopf&#x27;s designs, including Bavarian Mountain Railroad in 1987.

The company continued to produce flat rides and assist with roller coaster design for a number of years, and some popular releases during this time included the Bayern Kurve, the Enterprise, and the Monster. Schwarzkopf retired from the industry in 1995 and died on after battling Parkinson&#x27;s disease for several years.

==Legacy==
There are a number of notable people from the amusement industry who have either worked with, or have relations to Anton Schwarzkopf. His brother, Franz Schwarzkopf, was also a ride designer around the same time as Anton, and designed many staples of both amusement parks and carnivals alike, such as the Wave Swinger. Anton&#x27;s son Wieland Schwarzkopf also became involved with the industry, starting out at Schwarzkopf, and later starting his own business in 1984. Wieland&#x27;s company mostly provided parts and services for his father&#x27;s rides, but had a few of its own attractions, such as the &#x27;Sound Factory&#x27;, a short-lived version of the popular &#x27;Monster&#x27; ride with looping cars. Werner Stengel got his start with the Schwarzkopf company, and later went on to become one of the most prestigious designers of roller coasters and amusement rides. He was still heavily involved with most of Schwarzkopf&#x27;s attractions. Hubert Gerstlauer, founder and namesake of Gerstlauer Amuesment Rides GmbH, was an employee of Schwarzkopf, before starting his own company in 1982. Gerstlauer&#x27;s manufacturing is still carried out at the former Schwarzkopf facility in Münsterhausen, Bavaria.

Despite their age and shrinking numbers, Schwarzkopf rides remain popular. New Revolution at Six Flags Magic Mountain, Whizzer at Six Flags Great America, and at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm have all received the American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) Coaster Landmark award signifying their importance to the industry.

==List of notable roller coasters==
As of 2019, Schwarzkopf has built 149 roller coasters around the world.

The Sound Factory, a portable fair ride created sometime between 1998 and 1999, was retired in the early 2000s with hardly any video or photos of it. It returned sometime between 2017-2018 as The Parkour. The ride was modified with modern seats and no longer flips upsidown, making it not as thrilling or intense. As of September 2024 it is still in operation and can be found at fairs outside of the U.S.

<doc id="997250" wikidata="Q6537006" url="?curid=997250" title="Lewis River (Canterbury)">
<text>The Lewis River is a river in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. The valley of this river forms the southeastern approach to Lewis Pass; the river is thus adjacent to State Highway 7. The Lewis River is a tributary of the Boyle River. The Nina River flows into the Lewis River a few kilometres upstream from the confluence with the Boyle River. Land Information New Zealand lists the name of the river as &quot;not official&quot;, i.e. the name is not confirmed by the New Zealand Geographic Board. It was named for the surveyor Henry Lewis, who discovered the pass in 1860 alongside his colleague Christopher Maling. Later in 1860, the river was named by Julius von Haast during his own expedition; von Haast became the brother-in-law of Lewis&#x27; daughter in 1866.

<doc id="997251" wikidata="Q325854" url="?curid=997251" title="George Simpson (HBC administrator)">
<text>Sir George Simpson ( – 7 September 1860) was a Scottish explorer and colonial governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company during the period of its greatest power. From 1820 to 1860, he was in practice, if not in law, the British viceroy for the whole of Rupert&#x27;s Land, an enormous territory of 3.9 millions square kilometres corresponding to nearly forty per cent of modern-day Canada.

His efficient administration of the west was a precondition for the confederation of western and eastern Canada, which later created the &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot;. He was noted for his grasp of administrative detail and his physical stamina in traveling through the wilderness. Excepting voyageurs and their Siberian equivalents, few men have spent as much time travelling in the wilderness.

Simpson was also the first person known to have &quot;circumnavigated&quot; the world by land, and became the most powerful man of the North American fur trade during his lifetime.

== Early life ==

Born at Dingwall, Ross-Shire, Scotland, as the illegitimate son of George Simpson, Writer to the Signet, he was raised by two aunts and his paternal grandmother, Isobel Simpson (1731–1821), daughter of George Mackenzie, 2nd Laird of Gruinard—grandson of George Mackenzie, 2nd Earl of Seaforth—and Elizabeth, daughter of Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden. Simpson&#x27;s father was a first cousin of Sir Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s father-in-law.

In 1808, he was sent to London to work in the sugar brokerage business run by his uncle, Geddes Mackenzie Simpson (1775–1848). When his uncle&#x27;s firm merged with that of Andrew Colvile-Wedderburn in 1812, Simpson came into contact with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, as Colvile was a company director and brother-in-law of Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk.

== Career (1820–42) ==
This was at the time of conflict between the HBC and the North West Company. Governor William Williams, who had been sent out in 1818, had arrested or captured several North West Company men. The Nor&#x27;Westers replied with a Quebec warrant for Williams&#x27; arrest. The London governors were unhappy with Williams&#x27; clumsy management and both companies were under British pressure to settle their differences. The in Simpson&#x27;s title meant that if Williams had been arrested, Simpson would take his place. In 1820, he joined the prominent Beaver Club.

He went by ship to New York, by boat and cart to Montreal and left by the usual route for York Factory on Hudson Bay. He met Williams at Rock Depot on the Hayes River. Since Williams had not been arrested he was William&#x27;s subordinate and was sent west to Fort Wedderburn on Lake Athabaska. There he spent the winter learning about, and reorganizing, the fur trade. On his return journey in 1821, he learned that the two companies had merged. This put an end to a ruinous and sometimes violent competition and converted the HBC monopoly into an informal government for western Canada. He escorted that year&#x27;s furs to Rock Depot and returned upriver to Norway House for the first meeting of the merged companies. There he learned that he had been made governor of the Northern—that is, western—Department and Williams had been made his equal in the Southern Department south of Hudson Bay. In December 1821, the HBC monopoly was extended to the Pacific coast.

After the meeting he returned downstream to take up his duties at York Factory. In December 1821, he set out on snowshoes for Cumberland House and then the Red River Colony. By July 1822, he was back at York Factory for the second meeting of the Northern Council, the first that he chaired. After the meeting he went by water to Lac Île-à-la-Crosse and then by dog sled to Fort Chipewyan and Fort Resolution on the Tıdeè Lake. He then went south to Fort Dunvegan on the Peace River and then Fort Edmonton and after the thaw, back to York Factory.

=== Second Trip to the Columbia (1824–25) ===
In August 1824, he left York Factory for the Pacific, taking the unorthodox Nelson–Burntwood River route, and ascended the Churchill River and Athabasca Rivers to Jasper House at the east side of Athabasca Pass. He crossed the pass on horseback to Boat Encampment and then down the Columbia River, reaching its mouth on November 8 at Fort George, previously named Fort Astoria. This 80-day journey was 20 days faster than the previous record. He moved the headquarters of the Columbia District to Fort Vancouver, guessing that the south side of the river might fall to the Americans.

He left in March 1825, and crossed the snow-covered Athabasca Pass. From Fort Assiniboine he went on horseback south to Fort Edmonton on the North Saskatchewan River. He had ordered this new road laid out on his outward voyage. It was a major saving over the old Methye Portage route. He went on horseback from Fort Carlton to the Red River settlements, and then by boat to York Factory. During this trip his servant, Tom Taylor, became separated on a hunting trip. After searching for half a day, Simpson left Taylor to his fate. Taylor reached the Swan River post after 14 days in the wilderness with no proper equipment.

=== Third Trip to the Columbia (1828–29) ===
In 1825, he returned to Britain and learned that William Williams had retired, thereby adding the eastern area to his domain. Returning to Montreal, he went to the Red River settlements, Rock Depot for the annual meeting, the posts on James Bay to inspect his new domain, and back to Montreal. In May 1828, he started his second trip to the Pacific along with his dog, mistress and personal piper, going first to York Factory and then using the Peace River route. This trip remains the longest North American canoe journey ever made in one season. 

=== Marriage and Knighthood (1830–41) ===
He returned via Athabasca Pass to Moose Factory and Montreal and immediately went south to New York and took ship to Liverpool. After a brief courtship he married his first cousin, Frances Ramsay Simpson, in February 1830, and returned with his new wife to New York, Montreal, Michipicoten, Ontario, for the annual meeting, York Factory, and Red River. Here his wife gave birth to his first legitimate child, who soon died. In 1832, John Jacob Astor approached Gov. Simpson for talks to restrain liquor from the fur trade, and the two met in New York, but a binding agreement never ensued.

In May 1833, he suffered a mild stroke. He and his wife returned to Scotland, where she remained for the next five years and gave birth to a baby girl. In the spring of 1834, he returned to Canada and attended the Southern Council at Moose Factory in May and the Northern Council at York Factory in June, inspected posts on the Saint Lawrence, and arrived back in England in October 1835.

In the summer of 1838, he went to Saint Petersburg to negotiate with Baron Ferdinand von Wrangel of the Russian-American Company. The Russians recognized the HBC posts and the HBC agreed to supply the Russian posts. He then went to Montreal, Red River, Moose Factory, the Saint Lawrence posts, and down the Hudson to New York, where he took ship to England. Simpson received the title of Knight Bachelor from Queen Victoria, giving him the non-hereditary title of Sir on 25 January 1841.

=== Circumnavigation (1841–42) ===

He left London in March 1841, and went by canoe to Fort Garry (now the site of Winnipeg). On this part of the trip he was accompanied by James Alexander, 3rd Earl of Caledon, who left to hunt on the prairie and later published a journal. Travelling on horseback to Fort Edmonton, Simpson caught up with James Sinclair&#x27;s wagon train of over 100 settlers heading for the Oregon country, a sign of what would soon destroy his fur trade empire. Instead of taking the usual route, he went to what is now Banff, Alberta, made the first recorded passage of the pass named after him in August, and went down the Kootenay River to Fort Vancouver.

Guessing that the 49th parallel border would be extended to the Pacific and considering the difficulties of the Columbia Bar, he proposed to move the HBC headquarters to what is now Victoria, British Columbia, a suggestion that earned him the enmity of John McLoughlin, who had done much to develop the Columbia district. Simpson took the north along the Pacific coast to the Russian post at Sitka, and then another boat as far south as Santa Barbara, stopping at the HBC post of Yerba Buena.

At some point he met Mariano Vallejo, a Californio statesman and general. He sailed to the HBC post in Hawaii (then known as the Sandwich Islands) in February 1842, and back to Sitka, where he took a Russian ship to Okhotsk in June. He went on horseback to Yakutsk, up the Lena River by horse-drawn boat, visited Lake Baikal, went by horse and later carriage to Saint Petersburg and reached London by ship at the end of October. This trip was documented in his book, &quot;An overland journey round the world&quot;.

==== Hawaii ====

During his visit to Hawaii, he met with King Kamehameha III and his advisers. Simpson, along with Timoteo Haalilio and William Richards were commissioned as joint Ministers Plenipotentiary on 8 April 1842. Simpson, shortly thereafter, left for England, via Alaska and Siberia, while Haalilio and Richards departed for the United States, via Mexico, on 8 July. The Hawaiian delegation, while in the United States, secured the assurance of President John Tyler of its recognition of Hawaiian independence on 19 December, and then proceeded to meet Simpson in Europe and secure formal recognition by Great Britain and France. He was instrumental in arranging conferences between Hawaiian representatives and the British Foreign Office which resulted in a British commitment to recognize the independence of the islands. On 17 March 1843, King Louis Philippe I of France recognized Hawaiian independence at the urging of King Leopold I of Belgium, and on 1 April, Lord Aberdeen on behalf of Queen Victoria, assured the Hawaiian delegation that: &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Government was willing and had determined to recognize the independence of the Sandwich Islands under their present sovereign.&quot;

== Later life ==
By then, Simpson and his wife had a large house on the Lachine Canal across from the depot from which the fur brigades started west. He also owned other estates such as a Manor in Coteau-du-Lac that he sold to the Comte de Beaujeu and Adélaïde de Gaspé, and another estate in Dorval where he received and entertained Prince Edward VII, of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The Manor&#x27;s estate included the Fur Trade Depot, and was later sold to Senator Lawrence Alexander Wilson and Lt. Col. W. A. Grant of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. Lord Donald Smith of Knebworth House, Co-Premier of Canada Sir Francis Hincks, and other leading members of Montreal&#x27;s society would attend Simpson&#x27;s banquets.

He began investing in banks, railroads, ships, mines and canals. He became a board director and shareholder of Canada’s first bank, the Bank of Montreal, as well as of the Bank of British North America, the Montreal and Lachine Railroad, the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad, the Grand Trunk Railway, and the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company.

His business partners included Canada&#x27;s richest man Sir Hugh Allan, Sir John Rose, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, President David Torrance, minister Luther H. Holton, Senator George Crawford, Senator Thomas Ryan, banker John Redpath, and bankers John Molson and William Molson.

With Governor Drummond, Sir Antoine-Aimé Dorion, and John Young, they founded the Transmundane Telegraph Company, but the venture later failed. In the spring of 1845, he went to Washington, D.C., to discuss the Oregon boundary with the Americans, which he had already done with Sir Robert Peel. In 1846, the Oregon Treaty established the current border. His wife contracted tuberculosis in 1846 and died in 1853.

In 1854, he was able to travel by rail to Chicago before he boarded his voyageur canoe at Sault Ste. Marie. In 1855, he was in Washington, D.C., and discussed Oregon affairs, and in 1857, defended the HBC monopoly in London. In May 1860, he went by rail to Saint Paul, Minnesota; decided that his health would not bear the trip to Red River; and returned to Lachine.
In August 1860, he entertained the Prince of Wales at Lachine, who came for the inauguration of Victoria Bridge, in honour of his mother Queen Victoria. Simpson built Prince of Wales Terrace in his honour. The building, made of a limestone facade in the Classical Greek style, consisted of a row of nine luxurious houses, and was inhabited by Sir William Christopher Macdonald and Mcgill University&#x27;s Principal William Peterson. It was later demolished to make room for Samuel Bronfman&#x27;s pavilion, which was seen by Alcan CEO David Culver as an unforgivable act of vandalism.
A street was named in his honor, called Simpson Street, next to Parc Percy-Walters, McGregor Street, and Maison John-Wilson-McConnell. The park was previously occupied by one of his houses, and was part of his 15 acre estate on Mount Royal. It was then occupied by Rosemount House, which was built on the land of Governor Simpson and was the home of Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet, and later William Watson Ogilvie. Galt House was also built on Simpson Street by Canadian Founding Father Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt. The entrance of Simpson Street is now occupied by Sir George Simpson Tower.

Both Simpson Street and Prince of Wales Terrace were in the Golden Square Mile, a neighbourhood of Downtown Montreal where nearly 3/4 of all the wealth in Canada was held by its inhabitants. During that era, most Canadian enterprises were either owned or controlled by approximately fifty men. As the most important man in the North American fur trade, he was one of them.

=== Legacy and death ===
Shortly after the Princes of Wales&#x27;s visit, Governor Simpson suffered a massive stroke and died six days later in Lachine. At his death in 1860, he left an estate worth over £100,000, which in relation to GDP, amounted to half a billion dollars in 2023 Canadian money. The amount is also very similar to Harlaxton Manor&#x27;s building cost. Simpson also gave money to the general endowment of McGill University in 1856, along with Peter McGill and Peter Redpath, among others.

James Raffan, author of &quot;Emperor of the North&quot;, was of the view that Simpson should be counted among Canada’s founding fathers for his role as Governor-in-chief of Rupert&#x27;s Land, and its later merger in 1867 to form the &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot;. Rupert&#x27;s Land territory was Canada&#x27;s largest land acquisition to form modern Canada, and included land in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Montana, Minnesota, and North and South Dakota. In newspapers and books, he has been referred as the &quot;King of the Fur-trade&quot;, the &quot;Emperor of the North&quot;, the &quot;Emperor of the Plains&quot;, the &quot;Emperor of Lachine&quot;, the &quot;Birch-bark Emperor&quot;, and the &quot;Little Emperor&quot;.

Simpson also had a passion for Napoleon, and was living during his lifetime. It was one of the passions of his life, collecting writing relating to his hero, covering his walls with Napoleonic prints at Lachine Depot, Norway House and Fort Garry, and infecting the factors and fur traders of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company with them.

== Children ==
Simpson sired at least eleven children by at least seven women, only one of whom was his wife. 

During his years in London, he fathered two daughters, born to two separate women. Maria-Louisa, born 1815 to a mother named Maria, and Isabella, born 1817 to an unknown mother. Once Simpson left for Rupert&#x27;s Land, both daughters were sent to Scotland to be cared for by his relatives.

Sometime during his first year in Rupert&#x27;s Land, in about 1821, he met and began a relationship with Elizabeth &quot;Betsey&quot; Sinclair, a Métis washerwoman, who he likely met at Fort Wedderburn. He fathered one child with her, a daughter named Maria, who died at age 16 when she drowned while travelling to the Columbia District. Simpson ended their relationship when he began his 1822 trip westward, regarding her as an &quot;unnecessary &amp; expensive appendage&quot; who was of little use to him while he was away travelling. 

James Keith Simpson (1823–1901) is poorly documented. Ann Simpson, born in Montreal in 1828, is known only from her baptismal record. Simpson fathered two sons, George Stewart (1827) and John Mackenzie (1829), with Margaret (Marguerite) Taylor. George married Isabella Yale (1840–1927), daughter of fur trader James Murray Yale, of the Yale family. George was also the brother-in-law of Eliza Yale, wife of Capt. Henry Newsham Peers, grandson of Count Julianus Petrus de Linnée.

Soon after the birth of John Mackenzie, Simpson left Margaret to marry his cousin. Simpson shocked his peers by neglecting to notify Margaret of his marriage or make any arrangements for the future of his two sons.

<text>Thespesia garckeana (also known by its synonym &quot;Azanza garckeana&quot;) is a tree in the family Malvaceae, found throughout the warmer parts of Southern Africa in wooded grasslands, open woodland and thickets. It grows naturally over a range of altitudes from 1,000 to 2,000 m above sea level, from semi-arid areas to areas of higher rainfall. &quot;T. garckeana&quot; is often found on or near termite mounds in old fields.

Common names: African chewing gum, goron tula, snot apple, tree hibiscus, &quot;mutohwe&quot; (Shona), &quot;nkole&quot; (Sri Lanka), &quot;uXakuxaku&quot; (isiNdebele) and &quot;morojwa&quot; (Setswana).

== Benefits of African chewing gum leaves ==

# nutrients present in the fruit help cleanse the body system and prevent diseases like cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and fertility challenges.
# it serves as an aphrodisiac and aids against liver problems, and mental illness among other diseases.
# it assists in improving bowel movement, eases digestion and improves the body&#x27;s immune system. Most importantly, it is safe for consumption across all ages.

==Uses==
* The whole fruit except the seeds is chewed like gum, producing a sweet glutinous slime. The fruit is also used as a syrup and soup.
* The sap wood is yellow and the heart wood is a deep brown. It is easily worked but generally only suitable for small building needs, tool handles, oxen yokes, and domestic items such as spoons.
*The leaves of &quot;T. garckeana&quot; have many uses including green manure and mulch. The leaves also provide an often used fodder.

==Flavour==
The flavour is similar in taste to the mango fruit. The taste is quite different to a mango, it has a sweet scent, the darker the tinge, as well as the droplets of sap that cover the outside, glistening in the sun. It is a hard shell fruit, each segment of the fruit when consumed breaks down the compounds and creates a sticky, almost gelatinous texture and finally into a pulp, thats sucked of all its nutrients and is not digested. Like with any other fruits, when it is not ripe, you can tell by the green tinge, and the taste is more bitter in the fibre though sweet overall.

<doc id="997260" wikidata="Q4010521" url="?curid=997260" title="Specific angular momentum">
<text>In celestial mechanics, the specific relative angular momentum (often denoted formula_1 or formula_2) of a body is the angular momentum of that body divided by its mass. In the case of two orbiting bodies it is the vector product of their relative position and relative linear momentum, divided by the mass of the body in question.

Specific relative angular momentum plays a pivotal role in the analysis of the two-body problem, as it remains constant for a given orbit under ideal conditions. &quot;Specific&quot; in this context indicates angular momentum per unit mass. The SI unit for specific relative angular momentum is square meter per second.

== Definition ==
The specific relative angular momentum is defined as the cross product of the relative position vector formula_3 and the relative velocity vector formula_4.
formula_5

where formula_6 is the angular momentum vector, defined as formula_7.

The formula_8 vector is always perpendicular to the instantaneous osculating orbital plane, which coincides with the instantaneous perturbed orbit. It is not necessarily perpendicular to the average orbital plane over time.

== Proof of constancy in the two body case ==
Under certain conditions, it can be proven that the specific angular momentum is constant. The conditions for this proof include:
* The mass of one object is much greater than the mass of the other one. (formula_9)
* The coordinate system is inertial.
* Each object can be treated as a spherically symmetrical point mass.
* No other forces act on the system other than the gravitational force that connects the two bodies.

=== Proof ===

The proof starts with the two body equation of motion, derived from Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation:

formula_10

where:
* formula_11 is the position vector from formula_12 to formula_13 with scalar magnitude formula_14.
* formula_15 is the second time derivative of formula_11. (the acceleration)
* formula_17 is the Gravitational constant.

The cross product of the position vector with the equation of motion is:

formula_18

Because formula_19 the second term vanishes:

formula_20

It can also be derived that:
formula_21

Combining these two equations gives:
formula_22

Since the time derivative is equal to zero, the quantity formula_23 is constant. Using the velocity vector formula_24 in place of the rate of change of position, and formula_2 for the specific angular momentum:
formula_26 is constant.

This is different from the normal construction of momentum, formula_27, because it does not include the mass of the object in question.

== Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion ==

Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion can be proved almost directly with the above relationships.

=== First law ===
The proof starts again with the equation of the two-body problem. This time the cross product is multiplied with the specific relative angular momentum
formula_28

The left hand side is equal to the derivative formula_29 because the angular momentum is constant.

After some steps (which includes using the vector triple product and defining the scalar formula_30 to be the radial velocity, as opposed to the norm of the vector formula_31) the right hand side becomes:
formula_32

Setting these two expression equal and integrating over time leads to (with the constant of integration formula_33)
formula_34

Now this equation is multiplied (dot product) with formula_35 and rearranged
formula_36

Finally one gets the orbit equation
formula_37

which is the equation of a conic section in polar coordinates with semi-latus rectum formula_38 and eccentricity formula_39.

=== Second law ===
The second law follows instantly from the second of the three equations to calculate the absolute value of the specific relative angular momentum.

If one connects this form of the equation formula_40 with the relationship formula_41 for the area of a sector with an infinitesimal small angle formula_42 (triangle with one very small side), the equation
formula_43

=== Third law ===
Kepler&#x27;s third is a direct consequence of the second law. Integrating over one revolution gives the orbital period
formula_44

for the area formula_45 of an ellipse. Replacing the semi-minor axis with formula_46 and the specific relative angular momentum with formula_47 one gets
formula_48

There is thus a relationship between the semi-major axis and the orbital period of a satellite that can be reduced to a constant of the central body.

<text>Noir fiction (or roman noir) is a subgenre of crime fiction. 

== Definition ==
Noir denotes a marked darkness in theme and subject matter, generally featuring a disturbing mixture of sex and violence.

While related to and frequently confused with hardboiled detective fiction—due to the regular adaptation of hardboiled detective stories in the film noir style—the two are not the same. Both regularly take place against a backdrop of systemic and institutional corruption. However, noir (French for &quot;black&quot;) fiction is centred on protagonists that are either victims, suspects, or perpetrators—often self-destructive. A typical protagonist of noir fiction is forced to deal with a corrupt legal, political or other system, through which the protagonist is either victimized and/or has to victimize others, leading to a lose-lose situation. Otto Penzler argues that the traditional hardboiled detective story and noir story are &quot;diametrically opposed, with mutually exclusive philosophical premises&quot;. While the classic hardboiled private detective—as exemplified by the creations of writers such as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane—may bend or break the law, this is done by a protagonist with meaningful agency in pursuit of justice, and &quot;although not every one of their cases may have a happy conclusion, the hero nonetheless will emerge with a clean ethical slate.&quot; Noir works, on the other hand,whether films, novels, or short stories, are existential pessimistic tales about people, including (or especially) protagonists who are seriously flawed and morally questionable. The tone is generally bleak and nihilistic, with characters whose greed, lust, jealousy, and alienation lead them into a downward spiral as their plans and schemes inevitably go awry. ... The machinations of their relentless lust will cause them to lie, steal, cheat, and even kill as they become more and more entangled in a web from which they cannot possibly extricate themselves.Author and academic Megan Abbott described the two thus:Hardboiled is distinct from noir, though they&#x27;re often used interchangeably. The common argument is that hardboiled novels are an extension of the wild west and pioneer narratives of the 19th century. The wilderness becomes the city, and the hero is usually a somewhat fallen character, a detective or a cop. At the end, everything is a mess, people have died, but the hero has done the right thing or close to it, and order has, to a certain extent, been restored.
Noir is different. In noir, everyone is fallen, and right and wrong are not clearly defined and maybe not even attainable.Andrew Pepper, in an essay published in &quot;The Cambridge Companion to American Crime Fiction&quot;, listed the major thematic commonalities of noir fiction as &quot;the corrosive effects of money, the meaninglessness and absurdity of existence, anxieties about masculinity and the bureaucratization of public life, a fascination with the grotesque and a flirtation with, and rejection of, Freudian psychoanalysis.&quot; Eddie Duggan discusses the distinction between hardboiled and noir fiction, claiming that &quot;psychological instability is the key characteristic of the protagonists of noir writing, if not the key characteristic of the noir writers themselves&quot;. Similarly, Johnny Temple, founder of Akashic Books, observed that noir fiction tends to be written by &quot;authors whose life circumstances often place them in environments vulnerable to crime.&quot;

== Origins and later proponents ==
Beginning with 1940&#x27;s &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot;, author Cornell Woolrich wrote a series of six unrelated noir novels with &quot;black&quot; in the title, three of which were adapted for film in the 1940s. The word &quot;noir&quot; was used by the Paris-based publisher Gallimard in 1945 as the title for its &quot;Série Noire&quot; crime fiction imprint. In the English-speaking world, the term originated as a cinematic one—film noir. This term again first appeared in France, in 1946, though it did not enjoy wide use until the 1970s. Film noir refers to cinematic works based on novels of both the hardboiled and noir traditions, exhibiting realism and postwar disillusionment as influenced by German Expressionism.

James M. Cain is regarded as an American pioneer of the hardboiled and noir genres. Other important early American writers in the noir genre include Cornell Woolrich, Jim Thompson, Horace McCoy, and David Goodis. In the 1950s, Fawcett Books&#x27; Gold Medal imprint was instrumental in releasing noir and crime novels from such writers as Elliott Chaze, Charles Williams, Gil Brewer, Harry Whittington, Peter Rabe, and Lionel White, as well as Goodis and Thompson. In the 1980s, American publisher Black Lizard would re-release many of these works. Today, publisher Akashic Books features an elaborate line of noir short-story anthologies.

Prominent European authors of the genre include Jean-Claude Izzo and Massimo Carlotto. According to Italian publisher Sandro Ferri, &quot;Mediterranean noir&quot; is remarkable for its attention to the duality of Mediterranean life:
The prevailing vision in the novels belonging to the genre known as Mediterranean noir is a pessimistic one. Authors and their literary inventions look upon the cities of the Mediterranean and see places that have been broken, battered, and distorted by crime. There is always a kind of dualism that pervades these works. On one hand, there is the Mediterranean lifestyle—fine wine and fine food, friendship, conviviality, solidarity, blue skies and limpid seas—an art of living brought almost to perfection. On the other hand, violence, corruption, greed, and abuses of power.
Of latter-day novelists who write in both the hardboiled and noir modes, the most prominent is James Ellroy. Calling noir &quot;the most scrutinized offshoot of the hard-boiled school of fiction&quot;, he wrote:The thrill of noir is the rush of moral forfeit and the abandonment to titillation. The social importance of noir is its grounding in the big themes of race, class, gender, and systemic corruption. The overarching and lasting appeal of noir is that it makes doom fun.

==Rural/outback noir==

A sub-genre of noir fiction has been named &quot;rural noir&quot; in the US, and sometimes &quot;outback noir&quot; in Australia. Many rural noir novels have been adapted for film and TV series in both countries, such as &quot;Ozark&quot;, &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, and &quot;Big Sky&quot; in the US, and &quot;Troppo&quot;, &quot;The Dry&quot;, &quot;Scrublands&quot;, and &quot;High Country&quot; (2024) in Australia.

Norris Eppes suggests that &quot;Intruder in the Dust&quot; (1948) by William Faulkner and &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1970) by James Dickey were the earliest examples of rural noir. He interviewed seven authors who write rural noir fiction: Brian Panowich, Karin Slaughter, Attica Locke, Ace Atkins, Tom Franklin, John Hart, and James Sallis, who all give their opinions on the genre. Tom Bouman thinks that rural noir has its roots further back, in the 19th century, and cites the first 20th century novel to contribute to the trend as &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1934) by James M. Cain.

In Australia, outback noir increasingly includes issues relating to Indigenous Australians, such as the dispossession of land from Aboriginal peoples and racism. Filmmaker Ivan Sen is known for his exploration of such themes in his &quot;Mystery Road&quot; TV series and film of the same name with its prequel &quot;Goldstone&quot;, and his more recent award-winning film Limbo (2023).

<text>The Fantastic Journey is an American science fiction television series that was originally aired on NBC from February 3 through June 16, 1977. It was originally intended to run 13 episodes, as a mid-season replacement, but NBC cancelled the series in April, after the ninth episode aired. A tenth episode, already produced, was burned off two months later.

== Overview ==
The series concerns a family and their associates who charter a boat out into the Caribbean for a scientific expedition. In the Bermuda Triangle, after encountering a glowing green cloud, accompanied by the eerie disembodied sound of ship&#x27;s bells, the group find themselves shipwrecked on a mysterious uncharted island from which they cannot escape.

They encounter Varian (Jared Martin), initially disguised as an Arawak native, who is later revealed to be from the year 2230. A 23rd-century pacifist, musician and healer, Varian explains to the travelers that, like he and many before them, they have been caught in a space/time continuum where people from the past, present, future and from other worlds are trapped, co-existing on the island in a series of &quot;Time Zones&quot;. The only way home can be found in a place called &quot;Evoland&quot;, which lies &quot;far to the rising sun&quot; (it was indicated in interviews at the time that Evoland was also the name of the island). The only way to travel between Time Zones is via invisible gateways that instantaneously transport individuals or groups from one zone to another. In one episode, &quot;Beyond the Mountain&quot;, the group also encounters a second cloud, which has much the same effect, but which also splits up the group.

After the initial pilot story, a steady group of travelers forms around Varian as &quot;de facto&quot; leader, and the series then follows this group as they travel across the many Time Zones of the island to find Evoland. On their way, they encounter people from different planets and times who are also trapped on the island and who have adapted to their plight in different ways. 

The pilot initially suggested the historical past would be explored. The series, though, soon adopted a consistently futuristic style during the series following pressure from the network. Three characters after the pilot were also dropped, as they wanted a more exotic group of travelers, hence the arrival of Liana and Willoway. Liana disappeared from the last two episodes when Katie Saylor fell ill.

==Cast==
* Varian (Jared Martin): &quot;A man from the 23rd century possessing awesome powers&quot;, Varian generally uses a kind of crystalline &quot;tuning fork&quot; device called the Sonic Energizer through which he focuses his thoughts into what is described as a sonic manipulation of matter. The device is completely useless in anyone else&#x27;s hands, and seems capable of a huge variety of tasks, from opening doors to disrupting electrical systems to large scale acts of destruction, as well as its apparently intended function as a diagnostic and healing device. Following the departure of Professor Paul Jordan at the end of the pilot film, Varian takes over as &quot;de facto&quot; leader to the travelers and adopts a parental role over Paul&#x27;s teenage son, Scott (most notable in episodes such as &quot;An Act of Love&quot; and &quot;Turnabout&quot;).
* Scott Jordan (Ike Eisenmann): &quot;The 13-year-old son of a famous scientist&quot;, Scott has an excellent knowledge of Earth history and events, but is still young and has much to learn.
* Dr. Fred Walters (Carl Franklin): &quot;A young doctor just out of medical school&quot; whose impulsive and rather hot-headed nature acts as a counterpoint to the calm, pacifistic Varian. A friend of Scott&#x27;s father and the only other member of the group from the same time period, the athletic black physician takes the role of protective &quot;older brother&quot; with the young teen.
* Liana (Katie Saylor): &quot;Daughter of an Atlantean father and an extraterrestrial mother&quot;. The beautiful blonde Liana possessed greater than human physical strength due to her mother being from a planet with a higher gravity than Earth. (However, not much use was ever actually made of Liana&#x27;s strength.) She also had powerful psychic abilities (presumably due to her mixed heritage) which allow her to, among other things, telepathically communicate with animals - especially her cat Sil-El. Saylor left the show after the episode &quot;Turnabout&quot; due to illness. In the next episode &quot;Riddles&quot; the reason for her not being present with the group was given that she opted to stay a few days at Coriel to help the inhabitants work out their new government and would catch up with the group later.
* Dr. Jonathan Willoway (Roddy McDowall): &quot;Rebel scientist from the 1960s&quot; who has a mastery of computers, robotics and scientific knowledge which is quite useful to the group. He is something of a never-entirely-trustworthy black sheep, not unlike Doctor Smith from &quot;Lost in Space&quot; but without the latter&#x27;s cowardice; he often tends to do things for his own mysterious reasons. Over the course of the episodes, however, the black-clad Willoway comes to care about Scott and his fellow travelers and becomes more integrated into the group, although Fred makes no secret about still not trusting him, which leads to a bickering Spock/McCoy-style relationship between the two.
* Sil-El (The Felix Team): Liana&#x27;s companion and pet, a &quot;tuxedo cat&quot; with which she can communicate telepathically and who sometimes scouts ahead for her, acting as an extra set of eyes and ears.

==Production==
D. C. Fontana recalled that once the show had been commissioned, she and the producers had a very short period of time to develop and produce the show before filming commenced. Additional footage was shot and inserted into the pilot, introducing the Atlanteans, who are the focus of Episode 2. The addition of these scenes resulted in quickly moving off-screen the characters of Paul, Eve and Jill. They were originally intended to be regulars, but the network wanted a more diverse set of travelers. A subplot involving the group finding an Air Force pilot from the 1940s, held prisoner by 16th-century pirates, was removed from the first episode as well.

The character of Willoway was created with McDowall specifically in mind. The actor was interested, and took the role when it was offered.

The show benefited from more location filming than usual, with familiar sites such as the Hollywood Hills, Zuma Beach, the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles, and Griffith Observatory appearing in various episodes.

Although it aired in a time when the nation&#x27;s interest in the Bermuda Triangle, UFOs and fantasy was at a height, the show failed to find success. It was originally scheduled opposite &quot;The Waltons&quot; and &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;, both popular family series, as a midseason replacement for another failed fantasy show in that time slot, &quot;Gemini Man&quot;. NBC would repeatedly preempt and move the series before finally giving up on it, after only ten of the twelve episodes that the network had ordered to follow the revised pilot had been produced. The script for an eleventh episode, &quot;Romulus&quot;, has been circulated on the Internet.

Within a few months of the abrupt end of production, several of the team that worked on the series would be producing the thematically similar &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; for the 1977–1978 television season.

<text>Harsh Realm is an American science fiction television series about humans trapped inside a virtual reality simulation. It was developed by Chris Carter, creator of &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Millennium&quot;, and began airing on the Fox Network on October 8, 1999. The series fared poorly in the ratings and was removed from the schedule after three of its nine episodes had aired. The remaining six episodes premiered on the FX Network. Repeats of the series began airing Fall 2007 on CBC Country Canada.

The term &quot;harsh realm&quot; originates from the &quot;grunge speak&quot; hoax of 1992, in which it meant &#x27;bummer&#x27;.

The show was loosely based on a comic book by James D. Hudnall and Andrew Paquette. When the creators noticed the credits read &quot;Created by Chris Carter&quot;, they sued Fox to get properly credited. The credits were changed to read &quot;Inspired by the Harsh Realm comic book series, Created by James D. Hudnall and Andrew Paquette, Published by Harris Publications, Inc.&quot;

The series was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

==Setting==

Harsh Realm is a virtual reality game created by the U.S. Army, programmed to minutely replicate the real world for training simulations. In the world of Harsh Realm, a small nuclear bomb is detonated in the program&#x27;s version of New York City, killing four million people and thrusting its participants into a post-apocalyptic disaster scenario.

Lieutenant Tom Hobbes is unknowingly thrust into this world by his superiors with one mission: to kill &quot;General&quot; Omar Santiago. Along the way, he meets fellow soldiers sent into the game and alternate versions of people he knows in the real world. Tom Hobbes quickly finds companions such as Mike Pinocchio (a cynical long-time resident of Harsh Realm), Florence (a mute with mysterious powers) and Dexter (an alternate version of his real world dog).

Hobbes&#x27; target is Santiago, the highest scorer in Harsh Realm. Santiago, a U.S. Army Sergeant Major in the &quot;real world&quot;, is now a self-proclaimed &quot;General&quot; in the simulation who controls five U.S. states as a brutal dictator.

From his new companions, Hobbes learns that Santiago has commandeered Harsh Realm; Hobbes is merely the latest soldier in a long line of men sent on unsuccessful missions to kill the would-be dictator. Hobbes also learns from a mysterious &quot;ally&quot;, Inga Fossa, that Santiago is planning the ultimate act of terrorism in the real world so that Harsh Realm is all that remains.

It is in this world that Hobbes must survive, defeat Santiago, save the real world, and somehow return to his real life and his fiancée, Sophie Green.

==Cast==
* Scott Bairstow as Tom Hobbes. Lieutenant Thomas F. Hobbes was just days away from being discharged from the Army when he was called upon for one last mission and sent into the virtual reality simulation known as Harsh Realm. He was forced to leave behind his fiancée Sophie Green and put off their plans to move to California as a result. Hobbes was decorated for saving the life of his friend and comrade Mel Waters when they served together in Sarajevo in 1994. In the realm, Hobbes was reunited with the virtual character of his dog Dexter, who had died before the series. He also came upon the dying virtual copy of his mother, Katherine, at the same time she was dying of cancer in the real world. Hobbes grew up in Columbus, Ohio. His name is a reference to the 17th-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes used a Heckler &amp; Koch P7 pistol in the Pilot episode before moving onto the SIG Sauer P226 in episodes 2, 3, and 4, and then a Walther P99 for the remainder of the series. He also uses a Beretta M93R in episode 7.
* D. B. Sweeney as Mike Pinocchio . Specialist-4 Mike Pinocchio served in Operation Desert Storm. After that, he served in Yugoslavia, where he was severely injured by a land mine. The loss of his leg and eye prompted him to volunteer to go into Harsh Realm (in which Pinocchio has neither injury). In the Realm, he worked for Santiago before presumably faking his own death and going to live outside the fence. He is forced into an uneasy alliance with Tom Hobbes after attempting to rob him upon Hobbes&#x27; first entering the realm. He drives a modified 1972 Chevrolet Chevelle. His gun is a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5K PDW.
* Rachel Hayward as Florence. Florence is a mute VC (&quot;virtual character&quot;) with the ability to heal injuries that occur within the game (although pre-existing conditions coded into the game are beyond her capabilities). She was a member of a group known as the Sisters, all of whom were mute healers, but she left the religious group and took up arms. She now works as a mercenary of sorts, though she shows some loyalty to Mike Pinocchio. Her gun is a CAR-15 Commando (specifically, the Model 649 GAU-5A/A variant, as indicated by the 11.5 inch barrel, A1-type rear sight, and lack of forward assist and case deflector).
* Terry O&#x27;Quinn as Omar Santiago. In the real world, Santiago is a sergeant major in the U.S. Army and the most-decorated combat veteran to serve in Southeast Asia. He then retired, but apparently that retirement took him to Harsh Realm, where he holds the rank of General in the Republican Guard and is working from his Santiago City headquarters to take over the United States, renaming it the United States of Santiago. Pinocchio claims that Santiago is able to go in and out of the game at will, though how is unclear. The US government in the real world wants him dead, which prompts their sending Hobbes into the realm to stop him. His plans are said to involve destroying the real world so that Harsh Realm, where his rule is total, becomes the new reality.
* Max Martini as Mel Waters. Although they were best friends in the real world, Waters and Hobbes are at odds in Harsh Realm. Hobbes finds that Waters married Sophie&#x27;s virtual character, to his horror; things become even more complicated when Waters accidentally shoots and kills her at the end of the pilot. Waters holds the rank of major in the Republican Guard (Waters&#x27; real world military rank was sergeant) and often reports directly to Santiago. His gun is a Taurus PT99.
* Sarah-Jane Redmond as Inga Fossa. She works with the military in Fort Dix, New Jersey. She can come and go as she pleases between Harsh Realm and the real world, where she approached Sophie Green with information. She has a past connection to Pinocchio. Her motives in Harsh Realm are unclear, having also worked with Santiago, Waters, and aiding Tom Hobbes. &quot;Inga Fossa&quot; translates to &quot;in the trench&quot; in Latin. Redmond appeared in the 2008 film &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; as a character referred to on-screen as &quot;Agent Fossa&quot;, possibly a reprisal of the character.
* Samantha Mathis as Sophie Green. Sophie is Hobbes&#x27; pregnant fiancée, whom he was forced to leave behind in the real world. She has two sisters and a brother named Sam. The &quot;virtual character&quot; version of Sophie within Harsh Realm briefly becomes Hobbs&#x27; ally until she is gunned down by Waters, who happens to be her husband in the realm. This angers Santiago, who realizes that her death, even if it is not real, will act as a drive for Hobbes to take Santiago down.

==Episodes==
==Production==

The pilot was written by Chris Carter, best known as the creator of the science-fiction series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Carter wrote the pilot as a &quot;high-tech version&quot; of his favorite films—&quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. He said of the pilot: &quot;I think this has a tremendous romantic story and a great mythology potential, as well. I think it&#x27;s a great chance to tell allegorical stories … to take a godless world, where there is no morality, where there is no standard or code of behavior, and see what the world would be like if it were like that.&quot; The Fox executives worried that pilot episode included too much violence for the 8:00 p.m. timeslot, and they tried to get the producers of the show to tone the violence down in upcoming episodes. American writer Judd Apatow said he doubted Carter would tone down the violence: &quot;He&#x27;s going to do what he wants to do, and he should. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s his place to tone it down for people. It&#x27;s parents&#x27; place to say, &#x27;You know what? You&#x27;re not allowed to watch Harsh Realm&#x27;. But it&#x27;s much easier to say, &#x27;Take off the shows&#x27; than to tell parents to be aware of what their kids are doing.&quot; Terry O&#x27;Quinn stars in the episode as Omar Santiago. He was concerned that the viewers would find the show confusing, &quot;There might be some things if you miss the first one you won&#x27;t know what is going on. The writers are going to have to find a good one- or two-minute intro that explains things.&quot; When O&#x27;Quinn first read the script of the pilot, he &quot;pretty much understood the concept of the show when I read it, but I had a hard time visualizing it. I&#x27;m kind of computer illiterate. So I had a tough time seeing it. But the fact that Carter is doing it is a good starting point.&quot;

A tenth episode, entitled &quot;Circe&quot;, was written and directed by Mark Rosner, but never produced. In the episode Hobbes meets up with a woman claiming to be his old lover, while he was searching for an army to recruit. Pinocchio senses danger, and Florence finds both a prophecy and a traitor in the Resistance against Santiago.

The theme music contains samples of speeches given by Benito Mussolini.

==Reception==
The debut episode was watched by 7.5 million viewers during its original airing in the United States. 

On Rotten Tomatoes it has a score of 44% based on reviews from 18 critics. 
Ken Parish Perkins of the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; called the pilot &quot;dark, moody and confusing&quot;. Ed Bark of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; said &quot;Fans of heavy automatic weapons fire, bloodletting and unrelenting bleakness won&#x27;t be disappointed. A supporting character named Mike Pinocchio supplies the gutter-level language, none of which can be printed here.&quot; David Kronke of the &quot;Daily News of Los Angeles&quot; said: &quot;Fortunately, Carter makes the show&#x27;s pilot episode exciting, smart and edgy enough that, for the time being, viewers will be intrigued enough to see how this ordeal will play out.&quot; Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; wrote: &quot;If most of these &quot;Harsh Realm&quot; characters are virtual, why should we care? And if the show is playing out inside Hobbes&#x27; brain, why do any of the events depicted matter? Presumably future episodes will answer those questions, but the pilot exudes lots of flash and little heart. The characters lack any spark of life and depth. &quot;Harsh Realm&quot; could improve, but at this point dark conspiracies and paranoia have become tiresome. How many viewers will stick with &quot;Harsh Realm&quot; to a point it starts to make sense?&quot; Mark McGuire of the &quot;Times Union&quot; commented that &quot;Carter&#x27;s script and the direction of Daniel Sackheim are riddled with hoary, snory contemporary clichés.&quot;

Later Samantha Mathis said, &quot;I mean, did it actually air? My recollection on having done that was that it was greenlit into production when one person was the president of the studio and when we aired someone else was the president of the studio and as often times happens things just get abandoned because they were made by the prior regime if you will and people want to clean house. But I thought that was a very interesting provocative landscape and I was excited to work with Chris Carter – that’s all I really remember about why that didn’t launch.&quot;

==Lawsuit==
A lawsuit filed by the creators of the &quot;Harsh Realm&quot; comic book series that was licensed by Fox and Carter as the basis for the TV series became a precedent-setting case. In it, Fox attorneys argued that Carter&#x27;s sole &quot;written by&quot; credit was not only warranted, but required under the rules of the Writers Guild of America (WGA). Fox argued – with the support of the WGA – that it could not give Hudnall and Paquette the credit they demanded, because of the WGA agreement. &quot;The problem with this argument,&quot; Judge Martin responded, &quot;is that [Hudnall and Paquette] are not members of the WGA and are not bound by its contract. If the listing of the credits violates [their] right under the Lanham Act, the fact that the violation is pursuant to a contract with a third party is no defense.&quot; In response to the comic book authors’ request for a preliminary injunction, Judge Martin found that &quot;While there are substantial differences between the comic books and the television series, a trier of fact could find that it is misleading to represent Chris Carter as the creator of ‘Harsh Realm’ without giving adequate recognition to the role [Hudnall and Paquette] played in its creation.&quot;

==Home release==
The DVD box set features two commentary tracks on the pilot episode by the show&#x27;s creator and director as well as other special features.

<doc id="997303" wikidata="Q2297224" url="?curid=997303" title="Supernumerary nipple">
<text>A supernumerary nipple is an additional instance of nipple occurring in mammals, including humans and monkeys. They are often mistaken for moles. Studies variously report the prevalence of supernumerary nipples as approximately 1 in 18 and 1 in 40.

The nipples appear along the two vertical &quot;milk lines&quot;, which start in the armpit on each side, run down through the typical nipples and end at the groin. They are classified into eight levels of completeness, from a simple patch of hair to a milk-bearing breast in miniature.

==Types==
&quot;Polythelia&quot; refers to the presence of an additional nipple alone, while &quot;polymastia&quot; denotes the much rarer presence of additional mammary glands.

Although usually presenting on the milk line, pseudomamma can appear as far away as the foot.

==Clinical significance==
===Clinical presentation===
It may remain undetected. Occasionally, the supernumerary nipple is noticed when hormonal changes during adolescence, menstruation, or pregnancy cause increased pigmentation, fluctuating swelling, tenderness, or even lactation.

===Associations===
It is said to be found in association with many syndromes and other conditions:

* McKusick–Kaufman syndrome
* Char syndrome
* Simpson–Golabi–Behmel syndrome

A possible connection with mitral valve prolapse has been proposed.

===Treatment and prognosis===
Most often no treatment is required; however, a protruding embarrassing supernumerary nipple can be removed surgically, if desired. Removal using liquid nitrogen cryotherapy has also been described.

==Society and culture==

=== Television ===
&quot;The Triple Nipple Club&quot; is a documentary shown on Channel 4 which explored the biological mystery of the supernumerary nipple. First broadcast on 2 January 2008, it was directed and produced by Dan Louw and commissioned as part of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;First Cut&quot; series. The film focuses on Louw&#x27;s attempts to understand why he was born with extra nipples, a condition he shares with the likes of Mark Wahlberg, Lily Allen, and Tilda Swinton, as well as TV and film characters such as the James Bond villain Francisco Scaramanga and Chandler Bing from &quot;Friends&quot;. Fascinated and confused by this seemingly pointless mutation, Louw sets off on a personal journey of discovery to try and unwrap &quot;the riddle of the triple nipple&quot;. He starts out by consulting the man in the street and a renowned teratologist, an expert in physical mutations. After testing the notion that extra nipples could be a sign of fertility, he discovers that they are actually an atavism, or evolutionary &#x27;holdover&#x27;—a sign of how humans evolved.

English pop-star Harry Styles confirmed in 2017 that he has four nipples as a result of the condition.

<text>Donald Sidney-Fryer (born September 8, 1934) is a poet and entertainer principally influenced by Edmund Spenser and Clark Ashton Smith.

Born and raised in the Atlantic coastal community of New Bedford, Massachusetts, Sidney-Fryer enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in October 1953. While in the Marines, he first became enamored of &quot;imaginative literature&quot; and began to compile &quot;A Checklist of the Ballet Scores of Cesare Pugni&quot;, eventually published in 1961 as Vol. VIII of &quot;Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo&quot;. Following his honorable discharge at the rank of sergeant in August 1956, he moved to California, where he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles; during this period, he engaged in the concomitant study of classical ballet, working under David Lichine and Tatiana Riaboushinska for a year.

In 1958 and 1959, he visited Clark Ashton Smith&#x27;s home in Monterey, California; during these two excursions, Smith introduced him to the oeuvre of George Sterling. After graduating from UCLA in January 1961 with a B.A. in French and the death of Smith in August of that year, Sidney-Fryer commenced work on the poetry that would eventually comprise &quot;Songs and Sonnets Atlantean&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Emperor of Dreams&quot; (1976), a bibliography of Smith completed in 1965. From 1965 to 1971, he edited three volumes of Smith&#x27;s work for Arkham House, a task he would reprise for Pocket Books a decade later.

In 1969, he married Gloria Kathleen Braly, and started giving dramatic readings shortly thereafter at universities and other institutions, almost always incorporating material by Smith and Spenser. His poetry has continued to appear in a variety of weird fiction and speculative poetry-oriented journals.

Sidney-Fryer&#x27;s verse is marked by a strong imagination, and a Francophilic focus. He is a strong believer in &quot;pure poetry,&quot; and practices formalist verse, having developing his own specific poetic form: the &#x27;Spenserian stanza-sonnet&#x27;.

He remains a prolific historian of 19th century ballet, and is an expert on the ballet theatre of the romantic era.

<doc id="997320" wikidata="Q719634" url="?curid=997320" title="Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt">
<text>The Eleventh Dynasty of ancient Egypt (notated Dynasty XI; ) is a well-attested group of rulers. Its earlier members before Pharaoh Mentuhotep II are grouped with the four preceding dynasties to form the First Intermediate Period, whereas the later members are considered part of the Middle Kingdom. They all ruled from Thebes in Upper Egypt.

==Characteristics==
The relative chronology of the 11th Dynasty is well established by contemporary attestations and, except for count Intef and Mentuhotep IV, by the Turin canon.

Manetho&#x27;s statement that the 11th Dynasty consisted of 16 kings, who reigned for 43 years is contradicted by contemporary inscriptions and the evidence of the Turin King List, whose combined testimony establishes that this kingdom consisted of seven kings who ruled for a total of 143 years. However, his testimony that this dynasty was based at Thebes is verified by the contemporary evidence. It was during this dynasty that all of ancient Egypt was united under the Middle Kingdom.

This dynasty traces its origins to a nomarch of Thebes, &quot;Intef the Great, son of Iku&quot;, who is mentioned in a number of contemporary inscriptions. However, his immediate successor Mentuhotep I is considered the first king of this dynasty.

An inscription carved during the reign of Wahankh Intef II shows that he was the first of this dynasty to claim to rule over the whole of Egypt, a claim which brought the Thebans into conflict with the 10th-Dynasty rulers of Herakleopolis Magna. Intef undertook several campaigns northwards, and captured the important nome of Abydos.

Warfare continued intermittently between the Theban and Heracleapolitan dynasts until shortly before the 39th regnal year of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II, when the Herakleopolitans were defeated, and this dynasty could begin to consolidate their rule. The rulers of the 11th Dynasty reasserted Egypt&#x27;s influence over her neighbors in Africa and the Near East. Mentuhotep II sent renewed expeditions to Phoenicia to obtain cedar. Sankhkare Mentuhotep III sent an expedition from Coptos south to the land of Punt.

The reign of its last king, and thus the end of this dynasty, is something of a mystery. Contemporary records refer to &quot;seven empty years&quot; following the death of Mentuhotep III, which correspond to the reign of Nebtawyre Mentuhotep IV. Modern scholars identify his vizier Amenemhat with Amenemhat I, the first king of 12th Dynasty, as part of a theory that Amenemhat became king as part of a palace coup. The only certain details of Mentuhotep&#x27;s reign was that two remarkable omens were witnessed at the quarry of Wadi Hammamat by the vizier Amenemhat.

<doc id="997324" wikidata="Q7141373" url="?curid=997324" title="Parvocellular cell">
<text>In neuroscience, parvocellular cells, also called P-cells, are neurons located within the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Their name comes , due to the small size of the cell compared to the larger magnocellular cells. Phylogenetically, parvocellular neurons are more modern than magnocellular ones.

==Function==

The parvocellular neurons of the visual system receive their input from midget cells, a type of retinal ganglion cell, whose axons comprise the optic tract. These synapses occur in one of the four dorsal parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. The information from each eye is kept separate at this point, and continues to be segregated until processing in the visual cortex. The electrically-encoded visual information leaves the parvocellular cells via relay cells in the optic radiations, traveling to the primary visual cortex layer 4C-β. The parvocellular neurons are sensitive to colour, and are more capable of discriminating fine details than their magnocellular counterparts. Parvocellular cells have greater spatial resolution, but lower temporal resolution, than the magnocellular cells.

In February 2005, Relient K toured the Southern US states with Mae and Name Taken. They appeared at The Bamboozle festival in April 2005. In May and June 2005, the group supported Good Charlotte and Simple Plan on their co-headlining US tour. Between mid June and mid August, the group went on the 2005 edition of Warped Tour. &quot;Who I Am Hates Who I&#x27;ve Been&quot; was released to radio on August 23. In October and November 2005, they embarked on a headlining US tour, with support from MxPx, Rufio and Over It. Between February and April 2006, the group went on The Matt Hoopes Birthday Tour, with support from the Rocket Summer and Maxeen. Following this, they appeared at The Bamboozle festival.

==Reception==
&quot;Mmhmm&quot; received generally positive reviews and earned the group a Canadian Juno Award nomination for Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year in 2006. In 2005, &quot;Mmhmm&quot; was certified Gold by the RIAA for sales in excess of 500,000 units in the United States. It has sold over 800,000 copies in the United States. In 2006, the album won a Dove Award for Rock Album of the Year at the 37th GMA Dove Awards. It was also nominated for Recorded Music Packaging of the Year. The songs &quot;Be My Escape&quot; and &quot;Who I Am Hates Who I&#x27;ve Been&quot; received nominations as well.

<text>Magnocellular cells, also called M-cells, are neurons located within the magnocellular layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. The cells are part of the visual system. They are termed &quot;magnocellular&quot; since they are characterized by their relatively large size compared to parvocellular cells.

==Structure==
The full details of the flow of signaling from the eye to the visual cortex of the brain that result in the experience of vision are incompletely understood. Many aspects are subject to active controversy and the disruption of new evidence.

In the visual system, signals mostly travel from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and then to the visual cortex. In humans the LGN is normally described as having six distinctive layers. The inner two layers, (1 and 2) are magnocellular cell (M cell) layers, while the outer four layers, (3,4,5 and 6), are parvocellular cell (P cell) layers. An additional set of neurons, known as the koniocellular cell (K cell) layers, are found ventral to each of the M cell and P cell layers. These layers were named this way because cells in the M layers of the LGN are larger than cells in the P layers.

M cells in the LGN receive input from parasol ganglion cells (which some neuroscientists call M cells), and P cells receive input from midget retinal ganglion cells (which some neuroscientists call P cells).
From the LGN, the M pathway continues by sending information to the interblob regions of the 4Cα layer of the V1 region of the visual cortex, also called the &quot;striate cortex&quot;. Other cells in the striate are more influenced from signaling from P cells and yet others from K cells. As signals are passed to other regions of the cortex, the signals start to be less separate, more integrated, and more influenced by signals from other parts of the brain. While classically it is said that signaling through the M pathway ultimately flow out of the visual cortex through the dorsal stream and signaling through the P pathway ultimately flows to the ventral stream, subsequent studies have shown that both pathways influence both streams.

==Function==
The magnocellular pathway cannot provide finely detailed or colored information, but still provides useful static, depth, and motion information. The M pathway has high light/dark contrast detection, and is more sensitive at low spatial frequencies than high spatial frequencies. Due to this contrast information, M cells are essential for detecting changes in luminance, and performing visual search tasks and detecting edges.

The M pathway is also important for providing information about the location of objects. M cells can detect the orientation and position of objects in space, information that is sent through the dorsal stream. This information is also useful for detecting the difference in positions of objects on the retina of each eye, an important tool in binocular depth perception.

Cells in the M pathway have the ability to detect high temporal frequencies and can thus detect quick changes in the position of an object. This is the basis for detecting motion. The information sent to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) of the posterior parietal cortex allows the M pathway to direct attention and guide saccadic eye movements to follow important moving objects in the visual field. In addition to following objects with the eyes, the IPS sends information to parts of the frontal lobe that allows the hands and arms to adjust their movements to correctly grasp objects based on their size, position, and location. This ability has led some neuroscientists to hypothesize that the purpose of the M pathway is not to detect spatial locations, but to guide actions related to the position and motion of objects.

Some information has also been found to support the hypothesis that the M pathway is necessary for facial processing.

==Clinical significance==
Abnormal magnocellular pathways and magnocellular cells can be associated with various disorders and ocular impairments, including dyslexia, prosopagnosia and schizophrenia.

=== Dyslexia ===
Dyslexia is a disability which affects individual’s ability to read. It often first manifests in childhood, if at all; however, dyslexia can manifest itself in adulthood because of a brain tumor or lesion on/penetrating M cells. There is no clear idea of the role of M cells and the magnocellular pathway in dyslexia.

One theory suggests that the nonlinearity, size, and compensation of miniature eye movements of M cells all help to focus on a single target and blur the surroundings, which is crucial in reading. This suggests that M cells are underdeveloped in many dyslexics. This may be due to genetics, autoimmunity, or nutrition. The KIAA0319 gene on chromosome six controls cell migration to the LGN during development; and studies in transgenic mice and on brains of people with dyslexia examined after they died, show malformations in the LGN and cells expressing KIAA0319 growing in the wrong place. M cells are vulnerable to antineuronal antibodies which attack and render them unusable in the magnocellular pathway. This could be a cause of why dyslexics are more likely to have weakened immune systems.

Another line of research suggests that defective eye movement caused by M cells is the cause of dyslexia. Since the magnocellular system is sensitive to image movement, and dyslexia is posited to be caused by abnormalities in M cells, dyslexics tend to focus on words longer, take shorter scans when reading, and stop more often per line. The study postulates that this is not caused by dyslexia but rather, low comprehension of the text causing abnormal eye movements in M cells. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude the importance of M cells in dyslexia from this study.

=== Schizophrenia ===
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder in which people are unable to differentiate what is real and what is not. It is believed that the magnocellular pathway may help with facial recognition and discrimination in children, but when this pathway is not developed completely or correctly, facial processing is more difficult for individuals later in life. This is seen in people with schizophrenia and occurs when there are issues in the integration of information from the M cell and P cell pathways, making it difficult for individuals with schizophrenia to differentiate between reality and hallucinations.

<text>Anya Sun Corke (born 12 September 1990 in California, USA) is an American-born English chess player holding the title of Woman Grandmaster (WGM). She played for Hong Kong, where she was the top ranked chess player, until 2009.

== Career ==
Corke earned the WGM title with her performance in the 36th Chess Olympiad, playing for the Hong Kong men&#x27;s team.

She was the 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008 Hong Kong National Champion (for men and women), one of the youngest national champions ever at the age of 13 years and 9 months.

She was the British Junior Under-11 Champion in 2002 and the Under-12 Champion in 2003, the first girl to win either of these age groups. In 2004, she became joint British U-14 Champion.

In December 2004, she won the Asian Youth Girls U-14 Championship in Singapore.

In August 2005, she jointly won with Alisa Melekhina and Abby Marshall the second annual Susan Polgar National Invitational for Girls under-19.

Corke represented the England Women&#x27;s team at the 2012 Chess Olympiad in Istanbul, Turkey, and the 2013 European Team Championship in Warsaw, Poland.

== Personal life and education ==
In 2013, Corke graduated from Wellesley College summa cum laude with a B.A. in Russian and Philosophy.

In 2014, she started a Ph.D. program in Slavic Languages and Literatures at Yale University. She obtained an M.A. and M.Phil Slavic Languages and Literatures (specializing in Russian).

In 2019, Corke started the J.D. program at Yale Law School.

Corke is married and lives in the United States with her husband.

== Media ==
Her photograph was misappropriated by supporters of Barisan Nasional, the ruling political party of Malaysia, to depict the victim in a controversy alleging sexual misconduct by the son of Lim Guan Eng, who is one of the leaders of DAP, a Malaysian opposition party. DAP and their supporters then contacted Anya Corke to obtain an official denial that she knows Lim Guan Eng&#x27;s son; she confirmed that the allegations were false, and that the photo was used without her knowledge or consent. The original photo used in this controversy was stolen from an article on the website ChessBase News, and had the chess board cropped out.

<doc id="997333" wikidata="Q1567545" url="?curid=997333" title="Rōshi">
<text>(Japanese: &quot;old teacher&quot;; &quot;old master&quot;) is a title in Zen Buddhism with different usages depending on sect and country. In Rinzai Zen, the term is reserved only for individuals who have received &quot;inka shōmei&quot;, meaning they have completed the entire &quot;kōan&quot; curriculum; this amounts to a total of fewer than 100 people at any given time. In Sōtō Zen and Sanbo Kyodan it is used more loosely. This is especially the case in the United States and Europe, where almost any teacher who has received dharma transmission might be called rōshi, or even use it to refer to themselves, a practice unheard of in Japan.

==Etymology==
The Japanese &quot;rōshi&quot; is a translation of the more antiquated Chinese &quot;Laozi&quot; (Wade-Giles; &quot;Lao Tzu&quot;) meaning &#x27;Old Master&#x27; and connoting the archetype of a wise old man. The modern Chinese 老師/老师 (&quot;Chinese&quot; ) is a common word for teacher or professor without the religious or spiritual connotation of &quot;rōshi&quot;. Chinese Chán Buddhism (Zen is the Japanese transliteration of Chán) uses the semantically related title 師父/师父 or Mandarin &quot;shīfu&quot; (Cantonese &quot;sifu&quot;), literally &quot;master father&quot; or &quot;father of masters&quot;, or 師傅/师傅, literally &quot;master teacher&quot; or &quot;teacher of masters&quot;; both pronounced &quot;shīfu&quot; in Mandarin) as an honorific title for the highest masters, but it also may be used in respectful address of monks and nuns generally.

==Usage==
Traditionally, the term &quot;rōshi&quot; has been applied as a respectful honorific to a significantly older Zen teacher considered to have matured in wisdom and to have attained a superior understanding and expression of the Dharma (Japanese: &quot;mujōdō no taigen&quot;) . Typically, a &quot;rōshi&quot; will have received dharma transmission (Jap: &quot;inka shōmei&quot;) many years ago and although often the abbot or spiritual director of a monastery may in fact be too old to carry these responsibilities.

Despite this historical reality, it has come in some modern Zen schools to be applied as a general title for a teacher regardless of the age of the individual who receives it. This is especially true in the United States and Europe where it appears that some confusion has arisen where the word &quot;rōshi&quot; has been conflated with the term &quot;oshō&quot;, which is the generic term for a Soto Buddhist teacher who has received &quot;shiho&quot; and completed her or his basic training. Historically, the term &quot;rōshi&quot; will only be applied to an &quot;oshō&quot; after they have given many years of service as a teacher.

===Rinzai===
In some Rinzai organizations, a monastic is sometimes called &quot;rōshi&quot; after they have received &quot;inka shōmei&quot;, meaning they have completed &quot;kōan&quot; study and received Dharma transmission from their master;
According to roshi Sokun Tsushimoto, the title of &quot;rōshi&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Zen master&quot; and &quot;shike&quot;:
===Sōtō===
In the Sōtō organization, a person is sometimes called &quot;rōshi&quot; after they have received the title of &quot;shike&quot;, but this is by no means standard practice:
===Western Zen===
Many Zen communities in the United States confer the honorific title of &quot;rōshi&quot; to their teachers as a regular title, in deference to perceived Japanese Zen tradition. In most western instances it is used synonymously with the term Zen master, which has a quite specific meaning in Japan, namely the select group of persons who are qualified to supervise the headtemples and monk training halls.

In the west, Rinzai and Soto-uses of the term have been mixed:
In the Sanbo Kyodan, a lay organization that combines Soto and Rinzai elements, a person is called &quot;rōshi&quot; when they have received &quot;inka&quot;, indicating they have passed the &quot;kōan&quot; curriculum and received Dharma transmission.

==Criticism==
The use of the term &quot;rōshi&quot; in the U.S. and Europe has at times led to confusion and controversy. Stuart Lachs has argued that Zen institutions in the West have often attributed a mythic status to the title &quot;rōshi&quot; with harmful consequences.

<text>The Lincolnshire Wolds Railway (LWR) is a heritage railway based at Ludborough station, near Louth, Lincolnshire, England and the only standard gauge steam railway in Lincolnshire open to the public. The line is part of the original Great Northern Railway (GNR), a rail system that opened in 1848 and once linked Grimsby, Louth and East Lincolnshire with London. In early 2002, 2009 and 2013 the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway received a top national award from the Heritage Railway Association for its heritage railway efforts.

==History==
Construction of the railway began in 1846 and was completed in 1848. The line ran from Louth to New Holland and was officially opened on 28 March 1848 as the first section of the GNR. The line was constructed by the East Lincolnshire Railway Co (ELR), which leased it to the GNR when they could not raise sufficient funds to operate it. The GNR had obtained running rights over the MS&amp;L from Grimsby to New Holland Pier; in return it allowed the MS&amp;L running rights to Louth. The line south of Louth was extended as far as Boston in October 1848. The GNR ran the line with some of its famous C12 locomotives on the local services. From 1912 to 1913 Stirling single no.1 (preserved at the NRM York) was based at Louth shed (40c).

In 1923 the GNR, and with it the East Lincolnshire Railway, was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The LNER carried out some improvements on the line, including the replacement of the GNR Somersault signals with the more common upper quadrant at some locations. Box name boards were also changed from the black background with white lettering to the usual (and later BR specifications) white background with black lettering, although Louth South obtained an enamel sign, which remained on the box until its closure on 5 October 1970.

In 1948, Great Britain&#x27;s railway assets were nationalised under the Transport Act 1947; it gave the assets to British Railways so that the railway would remain open. At that time, the line&#x27;s passenger services were operated by steam railcar, but these were later replaced by diesel multiple units.

BR ran the line from 1948 until its eventual closure. BR had announced as early as 1965 that the line would close under the Beeching plan. The first attempt at closure failed after major local opposition and the Minister of Transport&#x27;s refusal to close a major route. But in 1969 the minister gave BR permission to close the line despite massive local opposition. The line from Firsby Junction to Grimsby was closed after the last passenger train departed on 5 October 1970. The line from Firsby Junction to Louth was quickly lifted, and the infrastructure left to deteriorate.

The section from Louth to Grimsby was singled (the down line lifted), and was retained for an additional 10 years for grain traffic three times a week to the ABM building at Louth. In 1978 BR announced that grain traffic would cease, and that the line would be removed and abandoned. In 1978, a group known as the Grimsby-Louth Group was set up to fight the closure of the line.

When the end became inevitable, the group was renamed the Grimsby-Louth Railway Preservation Society, with the aim of preserving the line for continued use. Despite their efforts, British Rail announced that the line would completely close on 20 December 1980. The Grimsby-Louth rail group did run several Santa specials over the line. The last one ran on 20 December 1980. BR closed the line and quickly removed the rails, sleepers and ballast, making it harder for preservationists to restore the line.

==Preservation==
In 1984 preservation efforts started rebuilding Ludborough Station to its former glory. The site had been virtually flattened by British Rail. All the buildings had been demolished, the railings and platform edges had been removed, as well as the track and ballast. The removal of the latter resulted in blocking the drains, with flooding of the site during rainstorms.

On 28 September 1991, preservationists obtained a Light Railway Order to authorise the reinstatement of the East Lincolnshire Railway between Waltham and the former Keddington Road level crossing near Louth. On 30 August 2003, NER 0-4-0T LNER Class Y7 No. 68088 steamed on the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway. The section towards North Thoresby railway station was reopened in 2009, and on 26 August 2009, the first train between and ran for the first time in 47 years.

Work has now begun on track re-laying at the south end of Ludborough station towards Utterby. Included in this work will be a new entrance to the engine shed coming in from the Louth direction. The new point work will be controlled by a 4-lever ground frame, which is released by Ludborough box and features in the new signalling system. The LWR launched an appeal in Summer 2012 to fund the purchase of track and ballast needed to extend the line.

==Operations==
Ludborough station has been restored to its original condition and is a working station museum, complete with an operational signal box. A 1 running line operates northwards to North Thoresby. Trains are operated by both steam and diesel locomotives. One of the line&#x27;s diesel locomotives, no. D3167 (08102) has strong local connections. The 08 was the resident shunter at Lincoln Central for many years.

==Signalling on the LWR==

The signalling used on the LWR is very basic but still forms a vital part of the operations. There are two signal boxes in use:

*Ludborough: built on the foundations of the original box, it is a close replica of what once stood there. Commissioned in 2004 by HMRI, the box was officially opened in 2005. It contains an 18 lever McKenzie and Holland lever frame which came from Hainton Street, Grimsby. It currently has four working levers, and a few more working levers are planned for the near future. Visitors are allowed in the box with the permission of the signalman.
*North Thoresby: situated off the end of the platform. It has a seven lever Eastern Region ground frame, and all the levers are in use. Its primary function is to control the siding and the main line in the platform.

Whilst North Thoresby has the conventional Upper quadrant signals, Ludborough has the more famous GNR somersault signals.

== Future of the LWR ==
The initial goal of reopening the line from Louth to Grimsby is no longer feasible, as part of the section between Grimsby and New Waltham was designated by Humberside County Council for the construction of the A16 Peaks Parkway Road, which was completed in 1998. These roadworks have made any future extension of the LWR to impossible. However, the LWR aspires to reconstruct the entire surviving of track bed between a new site at Louth and Holton-le-Clay.

==Stations of the LWR==
* – future northern terminus of the line
* (reopened in 2009)
* (reopened in 1998)
* – future southern terminus of the line (Louth (LWR)

<doc id="997342" wikidata="Q1719460" url="?curid=997342" title="KaBlam!">
<text>KaBlam! (stylized as KaBLaM!) is an American animated sketch comedy anthology television series that ran on Nickelodeon from October 11, 1996 to January 22, 2000, with repeats until November 2, 2001. The series was created by Robert Mittenthal, Will McRobb, and Chris Viscardi. The show was developed as a fully animated showcase for alternative forms of animation that were more common in indie films and commercials.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://variety.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode thus features a collection of short films in different innovative styles of animation, bridged by the characters Henry and June, who introduce the short animations and have zany hijinks of their own in between.

Although SNICK aired many Nicktoons not part of its block, &quot;KaBlam!&quot; was the only Nicktoon created for SNICK. The show was a critical and commercial success. The show was last aired as a part of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &#x27;The Splat&#x27; programming block on October 8 and 9, 2016.

== Production ==
The segment creators include David Fain, Tim Hill, Steve Holman, Emily Hubley, Mark Marek, Mike Pearlstein, Mo Willems, and Cote Zellers. The theme song and all of the original background music on the show was provided by the Moon Ska Stompers, a band that consists of King Django, Victor Rice, and members of The Toasters and The New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble. The bulk of the soundtrack was 30-second instrumental clips of songs from The Toasters&#x27; album &quot;D.L.T.B.G.Y.D.&quot;, while the theme song itself is a shortened version of the Toasters song &quot;2-Tone Army&quot;. Tracks from the Associated Production Music library were also utilized.

&quot;KaBlam!&quot; was the first show to be spun off of &quot;All That&quot;. It was pitched to Nickelodeon in 1994 and aired two years later. The pilot episode, &quot;Your Real Best Friend&quot;, was created in 1995 and finished in 1996. One of the shorts, Mo Willems&#x27;s &quot;The Off-Beats&quot; was initially produced as standalone short films for Nickelodeon; but after it was nominated for a cable ACE award, more segments were produced for &quot;KaBlam!&quot;

The show began production in 1995 and premiered on October 11, 1996. The show ran for four seasons, totaling 48 episodes. The final episode was broadcast on January 22, 2000. &quot;Kablam!&quot; was the final series to be greenlit (along with &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;) while Geraldine Laybourne was still the president of Nickelodeon.

In 2010, Mark Marek, who created the Henry and June shorts, co-created the Warner Bros. Animation-produced cartoon, &quot;MAD&quot;. Julia McIlvaine, who voiced June, also appeared in a few episodes.

== Episodes ==

===Season 1===
The first season began with regular cartoons in their regular order. &quot;Sniz &amp; Fondue&quot;, &quot;Action League Now!&quot;, &quot;Prometheus and Bob&quot;, and &quot;Life with Loopy&quot;. &quot;The Off-Beats&quot; was also another regular cartoon that occasionally filled in for &quot;Life with Loopy&quot; or &quot;Prometheus and Bob&quot;. Other cartoons such as &quot;Surprising Shorts&quot;, &quot;Lava!&quot;, &quot;Angela Anaconda&quot;, and once, &quot;The Louie and Louie Show&quot; aired. This is the only season in which a Sniz &amp; Fondue short is included in every episode. Henry and June frequently had random short plots when the screen was shown on them and barely had one main plot, unlike future episodes. They had one whole plot in &quot;Comics for Tomorrow Today&quot; and &quot;What the Astronauts Drink&quot;. The opening animation starts out with a hawk crashing into the camera while the camera pans through a forest, dives underwater and travels to Egypt where Egyptians dance and the Great Sphinx swipes at the camera. The camera then heads to outer space showing two kids in a ride, the planets, stars, asteroids, and flying saucers. After the United States Capitol is destroyed by two saucers, it then pans to a Godzilla-like monster destroying a city. It then pans to an open street comic book store and lands on the &quot;KaBlam!&quot; comic book, featuring the Flesh, Stinky Diver, Sniz, Fondue, and Loopy on it. The book is then opened by Henry and June. After they dance, the episode starts. At the start of the theme, a voiceover of a man shouts &quot;Wake up the masses!&quot;. As soon as he finishes, another man (Bert Pence) continues by saying, &quot;Assume the crash position. Hold on tight, take a deep breath for a new kind of cartoon show. It&#x27;s &quot;KaBlam!&quot; Where cartoons and comics collide. Now to take you inside and turn the pages, here are your hosts, Henry and June.&quot; The ending theme for most of the first season is The Toasters&#x27; song &quot;Skaternity&quot; (performed by the &#x27;Moon Ska Stompers&#x27;).

===Season 2===
After seven more episodes of &quot;The Off-Beats&quot;, and one last episode of &quot;Surprising Shorts&quot;, they were officially taken out of &quot;KaBlam!&quot; One-time shorts were brought in such as &quot;Randall Flan&#x27;s Incredible Big Top&quot;, &quot;The Girl with Her Head Coming Off&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Patchhead&quot; which did return in season 3. &quot;The Brothers Tiki&quot; appeared twice in season 2. Henry and June are now drawn differently and their voices are deeper. The opening theme to the show is barely changed. When the camera pans on the &quot;KaBlam!&quot; comic book, it is clearly seen that the cover is different. In place of the original characters, Thundergirl, Stinky Diver, Prometheus, Bob, Loopy, Sniz, and Fondue are seen. Also, Henry and June dance the macarena and then arm-in-arm, whereas in season one; it was just a bunch of random dances. The ending theme to the show is dramatically changed. Instead of Skaternity, it is &quot;Everything You Said Has Been a Lie&quot; by The Toasters (also performed by the &#x27;Moon Ska Stompers&#x27;). After this season, the rating for &quot;KaBlam!&quot; went up from TV-Y to TV-Y7 for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run.

===Season 3===
This season featured the last four episodes of &quot;Sniz &amp; Fondue&quot;. &quot;JetCat&quot; and &quot;Race Rabbit&quot; are introduced and become minor shorts that appeared from time to time. &quot;The Adventures of Patchhead&quot; makes its second and final appearance. A music video for a song by James Kochalka called &quot;Hockey Monkey&quot; also appears once. Henry and June are drawn a little differently and their voices are slightly deeper. The opening theme is shortened and Henry and June have their own main plots now. In the episode &quot;You May Already Be a...KaBlammer!&quot;, Lou Rawls is featured and voiced by the actual provider. The opening theme had a number of changes. After the camera comes up out of the water, it goes directly to the White House scene. After the Godzilla scene, the camera pans toward a school rather than the comic book stand. As it enters the classroom, the camera scares off a bird that was perched on a window. The camera pans by a teacher and through a number of students. It stops as it hits a student reading a &quot;KaBlam!&quot; comic book. On the cover of the comic book, it shows a child who is ecstatic. Henry and June then open the comic book, dance, and the episode starts. The announcer&#x27;s line as he introduces the show is slightly changed. Instead of saying &quot;Hold on tight, take a deep breath for a new kind of cartoon show&quot;, he says &quot;Hold on tight, take a deep breath for a cartoon cramaganza!&quot; The ending theme is not changed. This was also intended to be the final season until Nickelodeon renewed the show.

===Season 4===
All the shorts (except &quot;Action League Now!&quot; and &quot;Angela Anaconda&quot;, which both spun off into their own shows) come to an end in the final season. &quot;Life with Loopy&quot; and &quot;Prometheus and Bob&quot; air their last seven episodes while &quot;JetCat&quot; and &quot;Race Rabbit&quot; air their last one and three episodes, respectively. Music videos by They Might Be Giants appear twice; they were &quot;Why Does the Sun Shine?&quot; and &quot;Doctor Worm&quot;. One-time cartoons still appear: &quot;Fuzzball&quot;, &quot;Garbage Boy&quot;, &quot;Emmett Freedy&quot;, &quot;Stewy the Dog Boy&quot;, &quot;The Little Freaks&quot;, and &quot;The Shizzagee&quot;. One-time shorts are included in nearly every episode, excluding &quot;A Nut in Every Bite!&quot;, &quot;The KaBlair! Witch Project&quot;, and &quot;Now With More Flava&#x27;&quot;. In every episode, Henry and June have their own main plot. In the episode &quot;Sasquatch-ercise&quot;, Richard Simmons is featured and in the episode &quot;Now With More Flava&#x27;&quot;, John Stamos and Busta Rhymes are featured; however, the stars did not voice their characters. The opening and ending themes are unchanged.

==Shorts==
=== Regular shorts ===
Some of these shorts air more frequently and consistently than others.

==== Henry and June ====

The animated hosts of &quot;KaBlam!&quot; who turn the pages of a comic book (changes with each episode) to reveal the next cartoon or alternative animation, as well as being involved in subplots of their own between the shorts. These shorts were directed by Mark Marek.

;Characters
* Henry and June are the co-hosts of &quot;KaBlam!&quot; and are depicted as comic book characters who emerge from the eponymous publication to act as the viewer&#x27;s guides. The laid-back Henry is voiced by Noah Segan and the eccentric June is voiced by Julia McIlvaine.
* Mr. B. Foot is a giant Sasquatch who works on the show. His hobbies include sleeping, injuring Henry, and unexpectedly stealing the spotlight. However, under the rage and bluster, he is not a terrible creature; he never injures June. One episode reveals his ability as an accomplished drummer. He once spoke in the episode, &quot;A Little Dab&#x27;ll Do Ya&quot;.
* Mr. Fred Stockdale is the elderly network executive in charge of &quot;KaBlam!&quot; He acts rather senile, and will do anything to get &quot;KaBlam!&quot; good ratings—including firing someone or getting Henry into many physical accidents. His granddaughter Dawn says he has never been the same since &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; was canceled.
* Henry&#x27;s mother shows her love for her son in an exaggerated way. In &quot;Cramming Cartoons Since 1627&quot;, her name is revealed to be Lois.
* Mr. Jimmy McGee appeared twice as a co-host of June on &quot;KaBlam!&quot; He gets in fights with Henry&#x27;s mom. Appears to be a parody of Ed McMahon. His catchphrase is &quot;Ahooga!&quot;. Voiced by show writer Robert Mittenthal.

==== Sniz &amp; Fondue ====
 Began: Season 1 
Ended: Season 3

A pair of ferret roommates who often get on each other&#x27;s nerves. Sniz is the younger kid ferret that is very hyperactive, and quite a troublemaker of the duo, while Fondue is the older teenage ferret, who is the nervous, yet intelligent one. There is also Snuppa and Bianca, Sniz and Fondue&#x27;s roommates. From mid-1997 (around KaBlam&#x27;s second season) until Sniz and Fondue ended production in late 1998 (around &quot;KaBlam!&quot;s third or fourth season). Due to its production company going to work on a television adaptation of &quot;Watership Down&quot; as well as creator Michael Pearlstein leaving the show out of frustration, Sniz &amp; Fondue was taken off of the &quot;KaBlam!&quot; roster after season 3, although it still appeared in the intro. The show was created by Michael Pearlstein. The pilot &quot;Psyched for Snuppa&quot; was produced in 1992 by Stretch Films and Jumbo Pictures, and was directed by John R. Dilworth, creator of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;. Unfortunately, John R. Dilworth, Jim Jinkins, and David Campbell were only involved in the pilot, but later all had no involvement with the rest of &quot;Sniz &amp; Fondue&quot; when it became a part of &quot;KaBlam!&quot;. Reasons were that &quot;Doug&quot; creator Jim Jinkins and David Campbell have officially moved their jobs to Disney when they purchased Jumbo Pictures, and John R. Dilworth would later work on other projects, such as creating &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; for Cartoon Network in 1999.

==== Action League Now!====
 Began: Season 1 
Ended: Season 4

Filmed in &quot;Chuckimation&quot;, in which the characters/props are moved by unseen hands or thrown from off-camera (interspersed with occasional stop motion animation). &quot;Action League Now!&quot; featured a group of superheroes, played by custom-made action figures, who fight crime in suburbia despite being total idiots. The four superheroes are The Flesh, Thundergirl, Stinky Diver, and Meltman. Considered to be the most successful &quot;KaBlam!&quot; short, it briefly became a spin-off series in 2001. &quot;Action League Now!&quot; is the only short to have a new episode with every showing of &quot;KaBlam!&quot; and it served as the centerpiece of &quot;KaBlam!&quot;. All of the characters on the shorts were voiced by personalities from radio station WDVE in Pittsburgh. The show was created by Robert Mittenthal, Will McRobb, and Albie Hecht.

==== Life with Loopy ====
Began: Season 1

Ended: Season 4

The life of a preteen boy Larry and his strange experiences with his imaginative and adventurous younger sister Loopy. The characters were animated with stop-motion puppet bodies, but their heads were created with metal and their features were magnetic. The show was created by British-born Stephen Holman, who previously created &quot;Joe Normal&quot; for MTV&#x27;s &quot;Liquid Television&quot;, and later created &quot;Phantom Investigators&quot; on Kids&#x27; WB.

===== Characters =====
* Lupicia &quot;Loopy&quot; Cooper is an imaginative young girl with a knack for discovering surreal things, such as a world under the sofa. While she is often discouraged by Larry whenever she goes out to adventure, she does never let that stop her. Loopy is voiced by Danielle Judovits.
* Larry Cooper is Loopy&#x27;s intelligent brother. Much like Lassie, Larry knows every detail of Loopy&#x27;s adventures and narrates all of them, although he is not always there.
* Mrs. Cooper is Loopy and Larry&#x27;s mother. She is more intelligent, but one episode reveals that she was a secret agent.
* Mr. Cooper is Loopy and Larry&#x27;s father. He is more of the &quot;laid-back&quot; kind of guy, but one episode reveals he loses his temper when he receives bills.

==== Prometheus and Bob ====
Began: Season 1

Ended: Season 4

Also known as The Prometheus and Bob Tapes. A stop motion segment featuring the camera-recorded mission logs of Prometheus, an alien who comes to Earth attempting to teach a caveman, Bob, everyday things. From the use of fire to the act of ice skating, the result is usually a failure by the mischievous third cast member, who was a simple monkey. The show was created by Cote Zellers.

The introduction, done in a mock government format, describes the events as having occurred &quot;900,000 years ago&quot;.

===== Characters =====
* Prometheus is a gaunt purple alien of advanced intelligence who speaks with a hollow sounding voice. He attempts to educate Bob, a caveman, as an experiment recorded on his remote-controlled camera. Prometheus is often injured in slapstick ways due to Bob&#x27;s low intelligence.
* Bob is a babbling caveman. He once was completely covered in hair, but now has none because of a laser incident in the first clip. He also has a tendency to panic when frightened.
* The Monkey is a mischievous monkey who usually interferes with Prometheus&#x27; attempts to educate Bob, intentionally or otherwise. However, he has, on occasion, attempted to assist him.
* The Narrator recites the opening to the short, and the introduction to the short&#x27;s &quot;tape&quot;: &quot;Tape [insert number here]&quot;, and finally, &quot;End&quot;.

==== The Off-Beats ====
 Began: Season 1

Ended: Season 2

A series that centers on a group of unpopular friends and their main rivals, a popular clique known as &quot;The Populars&quot;. It originally aired during Nick&#x27;s commercial breaks as stand-alone shorts to promote the premiere of &quot;KaBlam!&quot;, and it was also released on a 1996 &quot;Rugrats&quot; videotape, &quot;Tommy Troubles&quot;. The show was created by Mo Willems, who later created &quot;Sheep in the Big City&quot; for Cartoon Network. The show was taken off the &quot;KaBlam!&quot; roster after season 2 because Mo Willems wanted to move over to Cartoon Network. However, The Off-Beats officially ended as a whole with a half-hour Valentine&#x27;s Day special premiering in 1999, which was the last episode of the Off-Beats produced, as Mo Willems finally left Nickelodeon in 1999, and moved to Cartoon Network to create &quot;Sheep in the Big City&quot; in 2000.

=== Other shorts ===
* Surprising Shorts – The only short segment not to have recurring characters, these shorts usually had nothing to do with any previous shorts included on the show. This segment was exclusive to season 1, and was usually introduced by June pulling down Henry&#x27;s pants, revealing his unflattering and garishly colored boxer shorts, hence the name.
** Lava! – Originally titled in France as &quot;Guano!&quot;, these shorts typically featured animals partaking in cartoonish situations. These were edited out of international airings and future reruns for copyright issues by Vivendi, as they own Canal+, which co-produced the shorts, although the credits for the short may still be intact. Some of the original &quot;Guano!&quot; shorts contained more inappropriate elements than what was featured on the show. This segment appeared 4 times throughout season 1, and once in season 2, without the Surprising Shorts introduction.
** Anemia and Iodine – One-time short. A cartoon displaying the misadventures of a Goth girl cat and her skateboarding, hyperactive best friend. It was created by alternative comics artist Krystine Kryttre and was directed by Robert Scull, most noted for his earlier work on Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life, and shares visual similarities to that show as a result.
** Angela Anaconda – A cutout-photo short that was later spun off into a stand-alone Canadian-animated series on the Fox Family Channel and was briefly rerun on Nickelodeon as well as Starz Kids and Family in the United States. This series is about a girl named Angela, who is a social outcast. She finds herself unpopular in school and always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Nanette, a faux-French girl who everyone loves and wants to be, always mocks Angela. During each episode, a poem-like story is narrated by Angela. She often gets her revenge on the antagonist of that particular episode, and more often &quot;imagines&quot; her revenge on the said antagonist in a highly exaggerated manner. Due to copyrights being held with Fox, the repeated &quot;KaBlam!&quot; shorts were banned airing on Nicktoons. Some people believe this is the reason why any season/series DVD release can&#x27;t become a reality. It appeared twice in season 1, with only the first appearance being introduced as a Surprising Short. Nanette, Johnny, and Mrs. Brinks had different voice actors in the original short.
* JetCat – A segment about a girl who has an identity as a cat superhero and flies around and saves her city. She says she &quot;flies like a jet and fights like a cat.&quot; This is the only short that takes place outside of the comic book. It was featured as a comic in &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot; for a short time. The music was composed by &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; composer Pat Irwin. Created by Jay Stephens of &quot;Tutenstein&quot; fame.
* Race Rabbit – A live-action show about a romantic rabbit racer with a British accent who competes in races, but there is trouble along the way caused by the Boolies (Zit and Winston), his human enemies. Race Rabbit always wins the race, foiling the Boolies&#x27; plans. The only &quot;KaBlam!&quot; short was created in the United Kingdom and produced by Scott Fellows, who also created the later show &quot;Johnny Test&quot;.
* The Adventures of PatchHead – A live-action/animated segment about a barefoot kid with a watermelon for a hat and has a Southern Accent, stopping cheaters from winning competitions. This short is notable for featuring an early appearance by Nick Offerman.
* The Brothers Tiki – A puppetry/stop-motion/live-action segment about two extraterrestrials resembling mini tiki statues (equivalent to lawn gnomes), who land on Earth in a ship bearing a striking resemblance to a barbecue grill.
* Fuzzball – A non-recurring cartoon about a tomboy who tries to win back her father&#x27;s trophy, which she broke. Created by Kevin Dougherty.
* The Louie and Louie Show – A short that appears only once on the show. Two neglected pets (a hamster and a chameleon), both named Louie, try to get some attention from their owners, who are all too busy playing with the family dog. This short was animated by Gary Baseman and directed by Tom McGrath. An early version, produced by Curious Pictures, also aired on Nickelodeon once by itself before &quot;KaBlam!&quot; premiered. The only &quot;KaBlam!&quot; short to have a &quot;Nickelodeon presents&quot; logo at the beginning. Louie the chameleon is voiced by James Belushi, and Louie the hamster is voiced by Billy West.
* Little Freaks – Another one-time cartoon. Three freaky superheroes try to stop a villain from controlling the world&#x27;s fashion trends. When it aired on Nicktoons by itself, the &quot;KaBlam! Presents&quot; at the beginning was absent.
* The Shizzagee – One-off short about the only existing creature of its kind who resembles a coyote and lives with his owner named Brutus. It is the only computer-animated short to air on &quot;KaBlam!&quot;.
* The Girl With Her Head Coming Off – one time short created by Emily Hubley.
* Randall Flan&#x27;s Incredible Big Top – one time short about a traveling circus ringmaster who must prevent his blue lion from performing in a town who hates blue lions.
* Untalkative Bunny – a one-time short that finally got a series in the early 2000s that, like Angela Anaconda, was produced by Canada&#x27;s Teletoon. This short had previously aired on an episode of &quot;Cartoon Sushi&quot;.
* Garbage Boy – one-off short animated in a collage-based art style about a kid who can make items out of garbage.
* Emmett Freedy – one-off short animated in stop-motion where a kid gets a piece of cereal stuck in his hair that is mistaken for lice.
* Stewy the Dog Boy – one-off short about a dog who acts like a boy, similar to &quot;Disney&#x27;s Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;.
* Dave, Son of Hercules – a one-off short about a preteen boy who is the son of the Roman god Hercules and is embarrassed by him. This was animated by the same people who did the Henry &amp; June segments.

There were also various They Might Be Giants music videos for the songs &quot;Why Does the Sun Shine?&quot; and &quot;Doctor Worm&quot;. In addition, there was a music video of &quot;Hockey Monkey&quot;, created by James Kochalka and performed by The Zambonis. These were a mixture of live-action by Jesse Gordon and different animation styles, all produced and directed at The Ink Tank.

== Cancelled spin-off film ==
In 1998, a live-action &quot;Prometheus and Bob&quot; film was announced, with Harald Zwart to direct, Amy Heckerling and Twink Caplan producing and Joe Stillman as screenwriter. However, it was ultimately scrapped due to lack of interest. According to Cote Zellers, Chris Farley and David Spade were both considered until the former&#x27;s death, and much of the script was reused for the 2010 film &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;.

==&quot;The Henry &amp; June Show&quot;==
A television special called &quot;The Henry &amp; June Show&quot; was produced and aired on Nickelodeon in 1999. The first segment, &quot;A Show of Their Own&quot; aired, featured Henry and June with a studio audience and musical guests. The next segment was &quot;Be True to Your School&quot;, where Henry and June attend school, and try their best to tackle hard subjects like &quot;How to Look Your Best&quot;. It was never shown again after it premiered.

==Blocks==
A number of blocks were hosted by Henry and June for various Nicktoons including:
* Henry and June&#x27;s Nicktoon Summer Jam – Aired from July 5, 1999 until the end of August 1999.
* 101% Whizbang! With Henry and June (AKA 101% Spooky Whizbang for Halloween 1999) – A block showing Nicktoons of a certain theme from September to October 1999.
* UPICK Friday/Monday - Aired from November 1999 until the summer of 2000
* Nicktoon World News with Henry and June – Aired in mid-2001 during &quot;SpongeBob&#x27;s Nicktoon Summer Splash&quot;

During the promos, Henry&#x27;s hair looked slightly different in some shots, along with it being a different shade of green. June&#x27;s cardigan was cherry-red instead of light red/dark orange, and the dots weren&#x27;t visible. Also, their eyes were blue and green in every shot, instead of being black or blue (or green) and black.

==Broadcast==
KaBlam! first premiered on October 11, 1996 and ran for four seasons, totaling 48 episodes. The final episode was broadcast on May 27, 2000. Reruns continued to air on Nickelodeon until 2001.

In 2002, Nicktoons was launched, and the channel began airing reruns of the program, though not all episodes were aired. During commercial breaks, various shorts from the show would play, not including any shorts involving Henry and June or music videos. In September 2005, Nicktoons revamped its branding and schedule, and removed several older series in the process, including &quot;KaBlam!&quot;. The &quot;KaBlam! Presents:&quot; shorts would continue to air until 2008 when the channel removed all of their intersitial programming for more commercial space. The program would only be seen one more time in December 2007 for Nicktoons Network&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Nicktoon Episodes&quot; marathon, although it was not shown when Nick had a marathon of the first episodes of each Nicktoon on Thanksgiving Day 2007, despite having Henry and June on the cover of the now-defunct &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot;.

KaBlam! was not seen on American television again until October 8–9, 2016, when Nickelodeon&#x27;s 1990s-oriented block on TeenNick spotlighted the show and other classic Nicktoons for the brand&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

Internationally, a French-language dub has been broadcast in France on television channel Game One (see Télévision Par Satellite), and other dubs of the show are on other Nickelodeon channels around Europe. It also was shown in the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2000 where the first episode was criticised for using the word &quot;spastic&quot; as by 1997 this word was considered grossly offensive in the UK and Ireland. In Poland, it aired from 1999 to 2001 on Fantastic. The show was aired in Estonia as well. The show is aired on YTV in Canada.

== Reception ==
&quot;KaBlam!&quot; mainly received positive reviews from television critics and audiences. Rotten Tomatoes review aggregator has an approval rating of 100% in season 1 based on five reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10.

Emily Ashby of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; rated this show four stars out of five, saying that it &quot;deserves bonus points for creativity with its inclusive animation style that makes it a lot of fun to watch.&quot; She highlighted the show&#x27;s &quot;Action League Now!&quot; segment as &quot;one of the show&#x27;s most memorable segments.&quot; Ray Richmond of &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;the idea of a kids&#x27; show using cel, paper-cut, clay, computer, pixilated live-action, and stop-motion animation to fill a half-hour is in itself revolutionary. If the quality of &quot;&#x27;Kablam!&quot;&#x27; is initially inconsistent, it&#x27;s easy to forgive an enterprise that aims its arrows in so many ambitious directions.&quot;

In 2016, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked at 25th of the &quot;Nickelodeon&#x27;s 25 Best TV Shows Ever&quot; in the list.

==Home media and streaming==
The show has only one episode &quot;Won&#x27;t Crack or Peel&quot; (3D broadcast version) that was ever released on VHS, as part of a promotion with Tombstone Pizza. There are no other home video releases. Nickelodeon insiders have stated that this is due to licensing issues regarding individual segments. Additionally, the show would not be included on a streaming service until VRV added &quot;KaBlam!&quot; on August 28, 2018. In June 2021, select episodes of &quot;KaBlam!&quot; have been made available to stream on Paramount+. and on Amazon Prime Video through a Paramount+ subscription. As of 2024, the series is missing 11 episodes (5 of season 1, 2 of season 2, and 4 of season 4) on the service due to these restrictions.

<text>Matthew Gregory Besser (born September 22, 1967) is an American actor, comedian, director, producer, writer, and one of the four founding members of the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch comedy troupe, who had their own show on Comedy Central from 1998 to 2000. He hosts the improvisation-based podcast &quot;Improv4humans&quot;, previously on the Earwolf network, but now solely operated by himself and Brett Morris.

==Early life==
Besser was born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, to parents Diane and Sandy Besser. His father was Jewish, whereas his mother was Christian. Besser is an atheist. He is a quarter German and a quarter French from his mother&#x27;s side. Besser&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s cousin was Joe Besser of The Three Stooges.

He was recruited to play soccer after starting on his high school team, but instead attended Amherst College with a major in American Studies. There, he started doing stand-up comedy and competed in a contest at UMass that was judged by Judd Apatow. After graduating, he briefly moved to Denver in an attempt to pursue stand-up, but quickly moved to Chicago. He worked various odd jobs, including stints as a substitute teacher, a host at Carnegie Deli and as a host at Dick&#x27;s Last Resort.

==Career==
After seeing an improvisational comedy show at Second City iO Theater featuring Dave Koechner, Tim Meadows and Chris Farley, Besser began taking classes there. His improv group Victim&#x27;s Family (alongside Rick Roman, Adam McKay, Miles Stroth, and Ian Roberts), later renamed The Family (minus Roman, plus Neil Flynn, and Ali Farahnakian), was directed by Del Close, the first long-form group Del focused on.

Besser is a founding member of Upright Citizens Brigade, which began as a sketch comedy group in Chicago in 1990. Original members included Ian Roberts, Ali Farahnakian, Adam McKay, Rick Roman, and Horatio Sanz.

In 1993, UCB were regular guests on stage at the New Variety produced and hosted by R. O&#x27;Donnell at the Chicago Improv comedy club.

While performing at the New Variety, Besser was cast and directed by O&#x27;Donnell in the New Year&#x27;s Eve special &quot;Twisted&quot;, which aired on WFLD Fox 32 TV, Chicago. &quot;Twisted&quot; also featured Besser (and comedian Michelle Garb) in a series of improvised commercials directed by O&#x27;Donnell for McDonald&#x27;s, Toyota, and Ameritech.

In 1996, the UCB relocated to New York City. Their sketch-comedy series &quot;Upright Citizens Brigade&quot; aired for three seasons on Comedy Central from 1998 to 2000. The cast consisted of Besser, Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts, and Matt Walsh. It originally included a voice-over by Del Close. After its cancellation, Comedy Central released all three seasons on DVD.

Besser and the UCB moved on to other projects and opened comedy theaters in New York City and Los Angeles. Besser went on to be the creator and co-star of the Redman &amp; Method Man MTV hidden camera prank show &quot;Stung&quot;. In 2004, he created and starred in his second Comedy Central show, &quot;Crossballs&quot;, which mocked news debate shows by pitting fake experts (played by Besser and other comedians) against real people.

Besser has appeared in films such as &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot;, &quot;Martin &amp; Orloff,&quot; &quot;Year One&quot;, &quot;Undead or Alive&quot;, &quot;Drillbit Taylor&quot;, and &quot;Junebug&quot;, in addition to a number of sitcoms including &quot;Reno 911!&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;New Girl&quot; and alongside his wife Danielle Schneider in &quot;Community&quot;. In 2003, the UCB filmed their first full-length improvised movie, &quot;Wild Girls Gone&quot;. In early 2010 the film was screened at several indie theaters in the Los Angeles area and is sold for digital download on iTunes and on DVD at the official &quot;UCB Theater&quot; website. The troupe had also performed their signature brand of longform improv (ASSSSCAT) in a special for the Bravo channel in 2005. In 2008, they released a DVD entitled &quot;ASSSSCAT!: Renegade Improv Comedy&quot; through Shout! Factory, which features an uncensored improv performance by the troupe and special guests. The DVD also includes deleted scenes and along with other bonus features.

In 2008, Besser played the part of &quot;Courtney Frenchip&quot;, the hippie roommate of David Cross in &quot;David&#x27;s Situation&quot;, a pilot made for HBO written by Cross and Bob Odenkirk. The pilot was filmed live on May 9, 2008, but was not picked by HBO as a series. In 2013, he portrayed Edwin Stanton in the &quot;Chicago&quot; episode of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Drunk History&quot;. Between 2011 and 2014, he appeared on &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; as the morning DJ Crazy Ira.

Besser and the UCB continue to run a Los Angeles comedy theater in Franklin Village. Besser and the UCB perform several times a week at the Los Angeles theater, in their show &quot;ASSSSCAT 3000&quot; every Sunday night.

==Other work==
Besser makes frequent appearances on many podcasts on the Earwolf podcasting network, including &quot;Comedy Bang Bang&quot;, as well as hosting &quot;The Earwolf Challenge&quot;, a reality-competition series where several podcasters compete against each other.

Besser&#x27;s Comedy Central pilot &quot;This Show Will Get You High&quot; aired as a sketch comedy special on October 27, 2010. The show featured video shorts and sketches from Besser and Upright Citizens Brigade Theater comedians John Gemberling, Brett Gelman, Paul Rust, and Betsy Sodaro, and Nathan Barnett.

In 2011, Besser began hosting the &quot;Improv4humans&quot; podcast, where he and guest improvisers perform scenes based on suggestions sent in via Twitter. The podcast releases an episode each week and has differing guests.

Besser wrote and directed his first film, &quot;Freak Dance&quot;, based on his long-running UCB stage show. The film premiered at the Austin Film Festival on October 21, 2011, and had a limited theatrical and video on-demand release in May 2012. The film was made available on DVD and iTunes on July 10, 2012.

In 2014, Besser and comedian Rich Fulcher had an Adult Swim special air as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;4AM Infomercial Parody&quot; series, called &quot;In Search Of Miracle Man&quot;. Besser and Fulcher hosted the show as two men claiming the second coming of a savior they call &quot;Miracle Man&quot;.

Besser co-starred in both seasons of the Hulu comedy series &quot;The Hotwives&quot;, which stars his wife Danielle Schneider, who also co-created the series. Besser plays the husband of Schneider&#x27;s character. In 2015, Besser and Schneider played another married couple (&quot;Blake and Karen&quot;) in the epilogue of a 2015 episode of the comedy series &quot;Community&quot;.

==Personal life==
Besser married actress-comedian Danielle Schneider in 2008. Their daughter was born on July 29, 2013.

<text>The Raw and the Cooked (1964) is the first volume from &quot;Mythologiques&quot;, a structural study of Amerindian mythology written by French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. It was originally published in French as &quot;&quot;. Although the book is part of a larger volume, Lévi-Strauss writes that it may be appreciated on its own merits, stating that he does not consider this first volume a beginning &quot;since it would have developed along similar lines if it had had a different starting point&quot;.

In the introduction, Lévi-Strauss writes of his confidence that &quot;certain categorical opposites drawn from everyday experience with the most basic sorts of things—e.g. &#x27;raw&#x27; and &#x27;cooked,&#x27; &#x27;fresh&#x27; and &#x27;rotten,&#x27; &#x27;moist&#x27; and &#x27;parched,&#x27; and others—can serve a people as conceptual tools for the formation of abstract notions and for combining these into propositions.&quot; Beginning with a Bororo myth, Lévi-Strauss analyses 187 myths, reconstructing sociocultural formations using binary oppositions based on sensory qualities. The work thus presents an adaptation of Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s theories of structural linguistics applied to a different field.

<doc id="997363" wikidata="Q4573248" url="?curid=997363" title="Bartholomew Burghersh the elder">
<text>Bartholomew Burghersh, 1st Baron Burghersh (died 3 August 1355, Dover), called &quot;the elder&quot;, was an English nobleman and soldier, a younger son of Robert Burghersh, 1st Baron Burghersh and Maud Badlesmere, sister of Bartholomew Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere. He was the father of Bartholomew Burghersh the younger.

==Life==
He was the second (or perhaps the third) son of Robert Burghersh, 1st Baron Burghersh, and succeeded to his father&#x27;s title and estates on the death of his elder brother Stephen. 
He was the nephew on his mother&#x27;s side and namesake of Bartholomew, lord Badlesmere, one of the most powerful of the barons. He married Elizabeth, one of the three co-heiresses of Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdun and his first wife Maud Mortimer (c.1289-18 September 1312), an alliance by which Burghersh increased his wealth and power.

Lord Badlesmere was a bitter enemy of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. Burghersh took an active role (1316) in the unhappy contests of parties in Edward II&#x27;s reign as an adherent of his uncle, whom in 1317 he accompanied in an expedition to Scotland. In October 1321, when Leeds Castle, Kent—the gates of which had been shut against Queen Isabella by Lady Badlesmere – surrendered to Edward, who had with unwonted spirit raised a force of thirty thousand men to avenge the insult offered to his wife. Burghersh, who was one of the garrison, was taken prisoner and incarcerated in the Tower of London. This imprisonment was probably the means of saving him from the fate of his uncle after the disastrous battle of Boroughbridge.

He was spared to aid in the overthrow of his unfortunate sovereign. 
On the landing of Isabella, on 24 September 1326, his brother Henry Burghersh, the bishop of Lincoln, hastened to join her, and with Orlton, bishop of Hereford, took the initiative in the measures which speedily led to Edward&#x27;s deposition and murder.

The important posts of constable of Dover Castle and warden of the Cinque Ports, which had been held by his father, were given to Burghersh, and he held both offices, with but slight intermission, to his death. 
In the unsettled relations between England and France, which lasted through the greater part of Edward IlI&#x27;s reign, the responsibility devolving on the holder of these offices, which implied the command of the chief channel of communication between the two countries, was of the highest moment, and it evidences the confidence reposed in Burghersh that he should have held them almost continuously during so important an epoch.

The commission, even originally in the name of Edward II, out really proceeding from the party conspiring only too successfully against him, was renewed by his son in the first year of his reign. 
The first royal missive to him in this capacity, contained in Rymer, is an order to have sixty does taken from the king&#x27;s park of Braboume, and salted for the use of the parliament about to meet at Westminster. 
This is followed by an order to use his authority to put a stop to predatory incursions on the French coast. 
Burghersh evidently very speedily obtained the complete confidence of the young king, which he retained uninterruptedly to the end of his life.

His services were rewarded by large grants of land and manorial privileges, escheated to the crown, or in some other way falling to the sovereign to dispose of. 
The King despatched him repeatedly on diplomatic errands. 
In 1329, he was sent to Philip of France to explain the reasons for the delay in the rendering of his homage, and in the same year as an ambassador to the pope, to plead for pecuniary aid from the revenues of the English church, a tenth of which was granted to the king for four years. 
Rymer contains a series of royal orders issued to him in his capacity of constable of Dover relating to prohibitions or licenses to cross the sea when the peace of the country was threatened, and to make arrangements for the passage of the king and other distinguished persons.

He was entrusted with other offices calling for vigour of action and practical wisdom. 
In 1337, on the assumption by Edward of the title of king of France, he was made admiral of the fleet from the mouth of the Thames westward. 
He was also appointed Seneschal of Ponthieu, Constable of the Tower of London, and Lord Chamberlain of the Household, in which capacity his presence is often recorded at delivery the great seal. 
In one of Edward&#x27;s grievous straits for money, he was entrusted with the pawning of the crown and other jewels. 
As Keeper of the king&#x27;s forest to the south of the Trent in 1341 he was commissioned to provide timber for the construction of engines of war and &quot; or wooden stages for the defenders of castle walls. As a good and experienced soldier he was continually in attendance on the king in his Scotch and French wars, taking part in the Battle of Crécy, 26 August 1346.

The confidence reposed in Burghersh as a diplomatic agent was equally great. 
He was frequently sent as may be seen in Rymer – often in company with Bishop William Bateman of Norwich – to treat with the pope at Avignon, with Philip of Valois with the counts of Brahant and Flanders, and other leading powers, on the traces and armistices so repeatedly made and broken, and to arrange the often promised but long deferred final peace between the two contending nations. 
As characteristic of the age, it is curious to find that under an excess of religious zeal, Burghersh, before the breaking out of the war with France when the return was comparatively quiet, had laid aside his arms and assumed the cross. 
Edward, unable to dispense with the services of so valuable a helper, when starting for Gascony in 1377, petitioned the pope to release him from his vow. 
Two years after Crecy we find him again taking part in the French wars, and despatched to Avignon to treat with the pope for a firm and lasting peace between the two countries. 
The next year (1349) he accompanied the earl of Lancaster to Gascony, to suppress the rebellion there. 
In 1355, when Edward was leaving England for a fresh invasion of France, Burghersh was appointed one of the guardians of the realm, but died at the beginning of August of that year.
He was buried in the chantry of St. Catherine, which he had founded in Lincoln minster for the soul of his brother Henry, bishop of Lincoln, and their father, Robert Burghersh. Monuments to all three, with effigies of the two brothers, are still to be seen.

== Family ==
He had the following children by his wife Elizabeth de Verdun, 2nd daughter of Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdun:

* Henry de Burghersh (died November 1348), married Isabel St John, daughter of Hugh St John, 2nd Baron St John of Basing but left no issue
* Bartholomew Burghersh the younger (died 1369), married Cecily de Weyland
* Thomas de Burghersh
* Joan de Burghersh, married John Mohun, 2nd Baron Mohun
* Margaret de Burghersh
* Maud de Burghersh, married Sir John Grey, 2nd Baron Grey of Rotherfield in Oxfordshire, son of John de Grey, 1st Baron Grey de Rotherfield, by his first wife Katherine Fitzalan. Their heir was their grandson Bartholomew Grey (4th Baron Grey of Rotherfield), named after his Burghersh great grandfather. Bartholomew Grey was the son of his parents&#x27; eldest son John Grey and his wife Elizabeth, dau. of Sir Richard de Poynings.
* Elizabeth Burghersh, who married Maurice FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Kildare, and was the mother of four sons, including Gerald FitzGerald, 5th Earl of Kildare, and John FitzGerald, the 6th Earl.

Bartholomew de Burghersh the elder was succeeded as Baron Burghersh by his son Bartholomew.

<text>Rita Rudner (born September 17, 1953) is an American comedian. Beginning her career as a Broadway dancer, Rudner noticed the lack of female comedians in New York City and turned to stand-up comedy, where she has performed for over three decades. Her performance on a variety of HBO specials and numerous appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot;, helped establish Rudner as one of the premier comics to emerge from the comedy boom of the 1980s.

==Early life==
Rudner was born in Miami, Florida, the daughter of Frances, an Orthodox Jewish homemaker from Brooklyn, and Abe Rudner, a lawyer from the Catskills. Rudner grew up in a Jewish family in Coconut Grove. She began taking ballet lessons at age four. Her mother died of breast cancer when she was 13 and her father remarried. She struggled to get along with her stepmother and felt a desire to become independent. After graduating from high school at 15, Rudner left Miami and went to New York City to embark on a career as a dancer. Beginning with a small role in &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; (joining the production in 1970), she appeared in several Broadway shows, including the now-legendary original productions of &quot;Follies&quot; (1971) and &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; (1974). She took over the role of Lily St. Regis in the long-running musical &quot;Annie&quot; circa 1980, and stayed with the company for over a year, leaving in 1981.

==Career==
After starting her standup career in the late 1970s, Rudner made her network television debut on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in 1982. She appeared frequently on television shows both in the US and the UK (recording a six-part series on BBC2 in 1990 in the latter), and she appeared often on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; as well as the HBO special &quot;Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s Young Comedians Special&quot;. She has recorded several award-winning comedy specials, most notably &quot;Rita Rudner: Born to Be Mild&quot; and &quot;Rita Rudner: Married Without Children&quot; for HBO and &quot;Rita Rudner: Live From Las Vegas&quot; for PBS in 2008.

Rudner and her husband wrote the screenplay of the 1992 film &quot;Peter&#x27;s Friends&quot;, in which she also acted. Rudner also has a role as the character Bunny in her husband&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Thanks&quot;, which had its world premiere at the 2011 Palm Springs Film Festival.

Rudner is the author of the books &quot;I Still Have It; I Just Can&#x27;t Remember Where I Put It&quot;, &quot;Naked Beneath My Clothes&quot; and the novels &quot;Tickled Pink&quot; and &quot;Turning The Tables&quot;. She has written several screenplays and plays with her husband. In January 2016, she appeared in a new play titled &quot;Act 3...&quot; alongside Charles Shaughnessy at the Laguna Playhouse, directed by Martin Bergman.

Since 2001, Rudner has performed almost exclusively in Las Vegas, selling almost two million tickets and becoming the longest-running solo comedy show in Las Vegas. She moved to a larger theater at The Venetian in January 2011. She also created and hosted the syndicated improvisational comedy show &quot;Ask Rita&quot;, which mimicked the format of a talk/advice show. For this she received a Gracie Allen Award from the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation (AWM). In May 2009 she performed for Senator Harry Reid and President Barack Obama at Caesars Palace alongside Bette Midler and Sheryl Crow.

==Personal life==
Rudner is married to Martin Bergman, a British producer. They have an adopted daughter.

<text>The narrow leaf-toed gecko (Phyllodactylus angustidigitus) is a medium-sized gecko with a maximum snout-vent length of 57 mm.

This species is endemic from the Ica Region in southern Peru, and its known geographical distribution is restricted to the Paracas National Reservation, including two islands (La Vieja in the Bahia Independencia and Sangayan west of the Paracas Peninsula). This gecko most closely resembles &quot;Phyllodactylus gerrhopygus&quot; (a species that also occurs in southern Peru), from which it can be distinguished by smaller and more numerous terminal lamellae on the fourth toe.

&quot;Phyllodactylus angustidigitus&quot; inhabits sand dunes, rocky outcrops, and small hills throughout the desert in Paracas, though it is usually more abundant near shore. These geckos abound along shelly and gravel beaches, and seem to avoid sandy beaches. This gecko feeds on small invertebrates, including insects, crustaceans and spiders. Females appear to lay only one egg.

<text>.pr is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Puerto Rico.

A .pr.us second-level domain has been reserved for Puerto Rico under the .us locality namespace, but it is unused. Agencies of the government of Puerto Rico use either .gov.pr or, more recently, subdomains of pr.gov, where the main government portal is located.

In March 2010, National Public Radio launched a URL shortener using the domain hack &quot;n.pr&quot;.

The domain is occasionally used by public relations firms.

==Domains and sub domains==
* .pr – for businesses, professionals, individuals, companies, etc.
* .biz.pr – for businesses
* .com.pr – for, but not restricted to, companies
* .edu.pr – for educational institutions with presence in Puerto Rico

<doc id="997380" wikidata="Q42032" url="?curid=997380" title="Country code top-level domain">
<text>A country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is an Internet top-level domain generally used or reserved for a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory identified with a country code. All ASCII ccTLD identifiers are two letters long, and all two-letter top-level domains are ccTLDs.

In 2018, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) began implementing internationalized country code top-level domains, consisting of language-native characters when displayed in an end-user application. Creation and delegation of ccTLDs is described in RFC 1591, corresponding to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. While gTLDs have to obey international regulations, ccTLDs are subjected to requirements that are determined by each country&#x27;s domain name regulation corporation. With over 150 million domain name registrations as of 2022, ccTLDs make up about 40% of the total domain name industry.

Country code extension applications began in 1985. The registered country code extensions in that year included .us (United States), .uk (United Kingdom) and .il (Israel). The registered country code extensions in 1986 included .au (Australia), .de (Germany), .fi (Finland), .fr (France), .is (Iceland), .jp (Japan), .kr (South Korea), .nl (Netherlands) and .se (Sweden). The registered country code extensions in 1987 included .nz (New Zealand), .ch (Switzerland) and .ca (Canada). The registered country code extensions in 1988 included .ie (Ireland) .it (Italy), .es (Spain) and .pt (Portugal). The registered country code extensions in 1989 included .in (India) and .yu (Yugoslavia). In the 1990s, .cn (People&#x27;s Republic of China) and .ru (Russian Federation) were first registered.

There are 308 delegated ccTLDs. The .cn, .tk, .de, .uk, .nl and .ru ccTLDs contain the highest number of domains. The top ten ccTLDs account for more than five-eighths of registered ccTLD domains. There were about 153 million ccTLD domains registered at the end of March 2022.

==Delegation and management==
IANA is responsible for determining an appropriate trustee for each ccTLD. Administration and control are then delegated to that trustee, which is responsible for the policies and operation of the domain. The current delegation can be determined from IANA&#x27;s list of ccTLDs. Individual ccTLDs may have varying requirements and fees for registering subdomains. There may be a local-presence requirement (for instance, citizenship or other connection to the ccTLD), as, for example, the American (us), Japanese (jp), Canadian (ca), French (fr) and German (de) domains, or registration may be open.

==History==
The first registered ccTLD was .us, which was registered in 1985. Later ccTLDs registered in that year included .uk and .il. Then, .au, .de, .fi, .fr, .is, .jp, .kr, .nl and .se were also registered in 1986. In 1987, .nz, .ch, .my and .ca were registered. Later on, in 1988, .ie, .it, .es and .pt were also registered.

==Lists==
As of 20 May 2017, there were 255 country-code top-level domains, purely in the Latin alphabet, using two-character codes. The number was 316 , with the addition of internationalized domains.

==Relation to ISO 3166-1==
===Unused ISO 3166-1 codes===
Almost all current ISO 3166-1 codes have been assigned and do exist in DNS.
However, some of these are effectively unused. In particular, the ccTLDs for the Norwegian dependency Bouvet Island (codice_1) and the designation Svalbard and Jan Mayen (codice_2) do exist in DNS, but no subdomains have been assigned, and it is Norid policy to not assign any at present. Two French territories—codice_3 (Saint Barthélemy) and codice_4 (Saint Martin)— await local assignment by France&#x27;s government.

The code codice_5, although eligible as ccTLD for Western Sahara, has never been assigned and does not exist in DNS. Only one subdomain is still registered in codice_6 (ISO 3166-1 for the United Kingdom), and no new registrations are being accepted for it. Sites in the United Kingdom generally usecodice_7 (see below).

The former .um ccTLD for the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands was removed in April 2008. Under RFC 1591 rules, .um is eligible as a ccTLD on request by the relevant governmental agency and local Internet user community.

===ASCII ccTLDs not in ISO 3166-1===
Several ASCII ccTLDs are in use that are not ISO 3166-1 two-letter codes. Some of these codes were specified in older versions of the ISO list.
* codice_7 (United Kingdom): The ISO 3166-1 code for the United Kingdom is GB (Great Britain). However, the JANET network had already selected codice_9 as a top-level identifier for its pre-existing Name Registration Scheme, and this was incorporated into the DNS root. codice_6 was assigned with the intention of a transition, but this never occurred and the use of codice_9 is now entrenched.
* codice_12 This obsolete ISO 3166 code for the Soviet Union was assigned when the Soviet Union still existed; moreover, new codice_13 registrations are accepted.
* codice_14 (Ascension Island): This code is a vestige of IANA&#x27;s decision in 1996 to allow the use of codes reserved in the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 reserve list for use by the Universal Postal Union. The decision was later reversed, with Ascension Island now the sole outlier. (Three other ccTLDs, codice_15 (Guernsey), codice_16 (Isle of Man) and codice_17 (Jersey) also fell under this category from 1996 until they received corresponding ISO 3166 codes in March 2006.)
* codice_18 (European Union): On September 25, 2000, ICANN decided to allow the use of any two-letter code in the ISO 3166-1 reserve list that is reserved for all purposes. Only EU currently meets this criterion. Following a decision by the EU&#x27;s Council of Telecommunications Ministers in March 2002, progress was slow, but a registry (named EURid) was chosen by the European Commission, and criteria for allocation set: ICANN approved codice_18 as a ccTLD, and it opened for registration on 7 December 2005 for the holders of prior rights. Since 7 April 2006, registration is open to all in the European Economic Area.

===Historical ccTLDs===
ccTLDs may be removed if that country ceases to exist. There are three ccTLDs that have been deleted after the corresponding 2-letter code was withdrawn from ISO 3166-1: codice_20 (for Czechoslovakia), codice_21 (for Zaire) and codice_22 (for East Timor). There may be a significant delay between withdrawal from ISO 3166-1 and deletion from the DNS; for example, ZR ceased to be an ISO 3166-1 code in 1997, but the codice_23 ccTLD was not deleted until 2001. Other ccTLDs corresponding to obsolete ISO 3166-1 codes have not yet been deleted. In some cases they may never be deleted due to the amount of disruption this would cause for a heavily used ccTLD. In particular, the Soviet Union&#x27;s ccTLD codice_12 remains in use more than twenty years after SU was removed from ISO 3166-1.

The historical country codes codice_25 for the German Democratic Republic and codice_26 for South Yemen were eligible for a ccTLD, but not allocated; see also codice_27 and codice_28.

The temporary reassignment of country code codice_29 (Serbia and Montenegro) until its split into codice_30 and codice_31 (Serbia and Montenegro, respectively) led to some controversies about the stability of ISO 3166-1 country codes, resulting in a second edition of ISO 3166-1 in 2007 with a guarantee that retired codes will not be reassigned for at least 50 years, and the replacement of RFC 3066 by RFC 4646 for country codes used in language tags in 2006.

The previous ISO 3166-1 code for Yugoslavia, YU, was removed by ISO on 23 July 2003, but the codice_32 ccTLD remained in operation. Finally, after a two-year transition to Serbian codice_30 and Montenegrin codice_31, the .yu domain was phased out in March 2010.

Australia was originally assigned the codice_35 country code, which was later changed to codice_36 with the codice_37 domains moved to codice_38.

==Internationalized ccTLDs==

An internationalized country code top-level domain (IDN ccTLD) is a top-level domain with a specially encoded domain name that is displayed in an end user application, such as a web browser, in its native language script or a non-alphabetic writing system, such as Latin script (.us, .uk and .br), Indic script (.) and Korean script (.), etc. IDN ccTLDs are an application of the internationalized domain name (IDN) system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, including the United Kingdom, or independent geographic regions.

ICANN started to accept applications for IDN ccTLDs in November 2009, and installed the first set into the Domain Names System in May 2010. The first set was a group of Arabic names for the countries of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. By May 2010, 21 countries had submitted applications to ICANN, representing 11 languages.

ICANN requires all potential international TLDs to use at least one letter that does not resemble a Latin letter, or have at least three letters, in an effort to avoid IDN homograph attacks. Nor shall the international domain name look like another domain name, even if they have different alphabets. Between Cyrillic and Greek alphabets, for example, this could happen.

==Generic ccTLDs==
Generic Country Code Top-Level Domain or gccTLD refers to those TLDs which are technically &quot;non-restricted ccTLDs&quot; but used like traditional generic TLDs (gTLDs) rather than &quot;country&quot;-targeted ones. Most of the gccTLDs are primarily used as domain hacks:

==Unconventional usage==
Lenient registration restrictions on certain ccTLDs have resulted in various domain hacks. Domain names such as codice_39, codice_40, codice_41 and codice_42 form well-known English phrases, whereas others combine the second-level domain and ccTLD to form one word or one title, creating domains such as codice_43 of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (codice_44), codice_45 of Belgium (codice_46), codice_47 of the United States (codice_48), and codice_49 of Tonga (codice_50). The codice_51 domain of Colombia has been cited since 2010 as a potential competitor to generic TLDs for commercial use, because it may be an abbreviation for &quot;company&quot;.

Several ccTLDs allow the creation of emoji domains.

Some ccTLDs may also be used for typosquatting. The domain &quot;cm&quot; of Cameroon has generated interest due to the possibility that people might miss typing the letter &quot;o&quot; for sites in the &quot;com&quot;.

===Commercial use===
Some of the world&#x27;s smallest countries and non-sovereign or colonial entities with their own country codes have opened their TLDs for worldwide commercial use, some of them free like .tk.

<text>The Raichur Doab is a Doab, in this case the triangular region of land in the southern Indian states of Telangana and Karnataka lying between the Krishna River and its tributary, the Tungabhadra River. The doab is named for the town of Raichur in the Raichur District. The Raichur Doab is considered to be very fertile because of the sediments carried by Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers.
The doab includes Raichur district and Koppal district in Karnataka, and Gadwal district in Telangana.
Some areas of Raichur doab also called as Nadigadda region became a part of Telangana during Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act in 2014.Those areas are Gadwal, Alampur and Maganoor. Gadwal is one of the 31 districts of Telangana State.

==Resources==

Hatti Gold Mines: Situated in Hatti of Lingasugur taluk, is currently the only working gold mine in India.
Evidently, it is one of the oldest mines dating back to Pre Ashokan times. During late 19th century, the gold mines were rediscovered.

Raichur Thermal Power Station at Deosugur, commissioned in 1986 was the first coal fired thermal electric power station to be established in the state. It accounts for 40% of electricity, generated in Karnataka.

==Agriculture==

Raichur Doab has the fertile tracts of deposits from Krishna River and its tributary Tungabhadra.

Sindhanur and Gangavati along with Siruguppa produces largest amount of paddies in Karnataka.

Raichur district ranks first in Mosambi /Sweet Lime production in the state.

==Geography==
The doab, named after Raichur is formed by Krishna River in the North and Tungabhadra river in the South. It lies within the Deccan Plateau region of Bayalu Seeme.

==History==
Raichur Doab is inhabited since the Prehistoric cultures. The early village settlements during the Neolithic and Iron age are base for sedentary lifestyles in Raichur Doab, and they exhibit rich faunal ecology of the region through rock art. During ancient period, the region was part of Maurya Empire as its southern capital was Kanakagiri. 

An edict of emperor Ashoka discovered in the town of Maski, was an important discovery as it solved the mystery of the title &#x27;devanampriya&#x27; which was found in many inscriptions scattered throughout the subcontinent. The Maski edict had the name of Ashoka written along &#x27;devanampriya&#x27; (Beloved of the Gods).

After Mauryan empire, the doab came under the control of Shatavahana dynasty which ruled over central and eastern Deccan. Later in the early medieval period, Chalukyas of Badami, Rashtrakutas and Kalyani Chalukyas ruled over the Raichur doab region.In the subsequent centuries, the region was ruled by Kakatiyas of Warangal and Hoysalas before being conquered and annexed by the Delhi Sultanate.

As Bahmani Sultanate was established at Gulbarga in 1347 AD, the region of Raichur doab was fiercely contested and bloody battles were fought over the forts of Mudgal and Raichur between the Bahmanis and Vijayanagar empire. 
Forces of Vijayanagar empire under Krishnadevaraya won the decisive Battle of Raichur in 1520 CE against Sultanate of Bijapur, and pushed across the Krishna river. But these short-term gains were decisively reversed when a confederate alliance of Deccan Sultanates defeated the Vijayanagar empire at Battle of Talikota in 1565 CE.

During late 17th century, the region came under the Mughal Empire and then passed into the rule of their successors under Nizam of Hyderabad. It remained under the Hyderabad State until 1948 when the princely state was annexed by the Indian Union.

During reorganisation of states on linguistic basis in 1956, the eastern part of the doab, Gadwal was incorporated in the state of Andhra Pradesh (currently in Telangana). The remaining part of the doab that formed Raichur district was incorporated in Mysore State (Renamed as Karnataka in 1973).
In 1998, a new district of four talukas was formed with Koppal as administrative headquarter.
