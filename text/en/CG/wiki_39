<text>First Hill is a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is named for the hill on which it is located, which in turn is so named for being the first hill encountered while traveling east from downtown Seattle toward Lake Washington.
First Hill is bounded on the west by Interstate 5, beyond which is Downtown, on the north by E. Pike and E. Madison Streets, beyond which is Capitol Hill, and on the south by Yesler Way, beyond which is the International District. The City of Seattle provides conflicting information about its eastern limit, beyond which are Cherry Hill and the Central District. Some describe it as being bounded by Broadway and Boren Avenues, while others describe it as being bounded by 12th Avenue.

First Hill has been home to Seattle University, a private Jesuit university, since 1891. Also located on the hill are Northwest School, Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Catholic O&#x27;Dea High School, and Frye Art Museum, as well as several churches that have become city landmarks: Trinity Parish Church, St. James Cathedral, and Seattle First Baptist Church.

==History==
First Hill became increasingly attractive in the 1890s as a location close enough to downtown for convenience, but removed enough to offer a sense of retreat for the wealthier residents of Seattle. Among the elite to live in the area at that time were Indian fighter turned businessman Granville O. Haller, local judge Cornelius H. Hanford, successful meatpacker Charles Frye (whose private art collection is now visible to the public at First Hill&#x27;s Frye Art Museum), contractor Morgan Carkeek (for whom Carkeek Park is named), William Boeing, founder of the Boeing Company and Judge Hiram Bond. The photographer Imogen Cunningham and her husband Roi Partridge lived in a boarding house on First Hill during the 1910s, until the residents of the house were evicted and the property converted into a hospital. More recently, local philanthropist and businesswoman Patsy Bullitt Collins resided in a First Hill condominium.

===First King County Courthouse===
The first official King County Courthouse was built on First Hill in 1889–1890. The steep climb to the courthouse from downtown legal offices caused such frequent and vociferous complaints that Seattle lawyers nicknamed the area &quot;Profanity Hill&quot;. The courthouse, constructed on the corner of 7th Avenue and Alder Street, was quickly outgrown, which, along with the loud dissatisfaction of local attorneys, led the county to move the courthouse off First Hill in 1916.

==Pill Hill==
The hill is also known as &quot;Pill Hill&quot; due to its many medical buildings. In addition to being the current home of three major health care facilities (Harborview Medical Center, Swedish Medical Center/First Hill, and Virginia Mason Medical Center or four if Swedish Medical Center/Cherry Hill, located on 16th Avenue, is included in the neighborhood), and the Puget Sound Blood Center, it was also once the location of the Maynard, Seattle General, and Doctors Hospitals (all of which merged into Swedish) as well as Cabrini Hospital.

==Transportation==
First Hill&#x27;s major thoroughfares, assuming its greatest possible extent, include Madison, James, Cherry, and Spring Streets and Yesler Way (east- and west-bound) and 9th and Boren Avenues and Broadway (north- and south-bound).

===Public Transportation===
A Link light rail station was originally planned for First Hill, but was cancelled due to geotechnical risks prior to the construction of University Link. Instead, the First Hill Streetcar was built on Broadway and Jackson Street to connect First Hill with the International District / Chinatown and Capitol Hill stations, beginning service in January 2016.

<text>Klazina Judith Wasylycia-Leis (; born 1951) is a Canadian politician. She was a Manitoba cabinet minister in the government of Howard Pawley from 1986 to 1988, and was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from September 22, 1997, to April 30, 2010. In 2010 and 2014 she was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of Winnipeg.

==Early life==
She was born Klazina Judith Wasylycia, the daughter of Harry Wasylycia and Klazina Nielson, in Winterbourne, Ontario, a small town near Kitchener, on August 10, 1951. She graduated from Elmira District Secondary School in 1970. Wasylycia-Leis was educated at the University of Waterloo, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in political science and French in 1974, and Carleton University, where she received a Master of Arts in political science in 1976. She worked as a policy planning consultant for the New Democratic Party following her graduation, and served as an executive assistant to party leader Ed Broadbent. She also served as women&#x27;s organizer for the federal NDP during this period.

In 1972, she married Ronald Wayne Leis.

Wasylycia-Leis ran for office three times while living in Ontario, though she was not elected on any of these occasions. In 1977, she ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for the provincial NDP in the riding of Carleton, and received 6,837 votes for a third-place finish. She ran for the seat again in a 1980 by-election and the 1981 general election, and again placed third on each occasion.

==Manitoba legislature==
Wasylycia-Leis moved to Manitoba during the 1980s, where she worked as an executive assistant to Premier Howard Pawley and coordinated the Women&#x27;s Directorate in the Manitoba government.

In the mid 1980s, she decided to challenge longtime incumbent NDP MLA Donald Malinowski for the nomination in the North End Winnipeg riding of St. Johns, which was generally considered a safe seat for the party. &quot;Everyone said it was impossible to beat Father Malinowski,&quot; she said. Wasylycia-Leis&#x27; campaign for the nomination gained so much momentum that it led Malinowski to drop out of the race. In the end, she won the 1986 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative John Baluta by almost two thousand votes.

On April 17, 1986, Wasylycia-Leis was appointed to the Manitoba cabinet as Minister of Culture, Heritage and Recreation with responsibility for Status of Women and the administration of the Manitoba Lotteries Foundation Act. She was relieved of the Status of Women responsibility on September 21, 1987, but retained the other two positions until the Pawley government was defeated in the 1988 provincial election.

Wasylycia-Leis was re-elected in 1988, although by a narrower margin; she defeated Liberal Ruth Oberman, 3,092 votes to 2,480. In the 1990 provincial election, she was re-elected again by a wider margin, defeating Mark Minenko, the incumbent from Seven Oaks, which was eliminated due to redistribution.

==Federal politics==
Wasylycia-Leis resigned her seat on August 12, 1993, to seek (and win) the federal NDP nomination in the riding of Winnipeg North. The NDP fared poorly in the 1993 election, however, and Wasylycia-Leis lost to Liberal Rey Pagtakhan by almost 10,000 votes. She subsequently became a co-chair of Cho!ces, a Manitoba social-justice coalition. In the 1997 federal election, Wasylycia-Leis ran in the riding of Winnipeg North Centre, and defeated Liberal Judith Optiz Silver, 13,663 votes to 7,801. She was re-elected by a wider margin in the 2000 election. In 2003, she supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the federal NDP. Redistribution placed Wasylycia-Leis against Pagtakhan again for the 2004 federal election, in the altered riding of Winnipeg North. On this occasion, Wasylycia-Leis defeated Pagtakhan 12,507 votes to 9,491.

In Parliament, Wasylycia-Leis has focused primarily on issues relating to women (including women&#x27;s health concerns) and general human rights. She has served as her party&#x27;s health critic, and was made critic for women&#x27;s and senior&#x27;s issues in 2001. She is also an advocate for Israel, and in recent years has been critical of some of her party&#x27;s foreign policy positions as regards Israel and the Middle East.

Wasylycia-Leis was named Deputy Caucus Chair of the parliamentary NDP on January 30, 2003. On August 2, 2004, she was promoted to caucus chair. In 2003 Wasylycia-Leis was also named the finance critic. In November 2004, Wasylycia-Leis traveled to Ukraine to monitor developments in that country&#x27;s disputed presidential election.

===Finance critic===
She became the centre of a national controversy during the 2006 election campaign. She had contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) requesting an investigation into whether or not Liberal Finance Minister Ralph Goodale had illegally leaked information regarding a government announcement on income trusts, so as to benefit certain insiders. Following her request, RCMP Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli wrote to Wasylycia-Leis to inform her that the RCMP had commenced a criminal probe into the matter. The letter was delivered to her offices, which were closed for the holidays. When she did not respond to the letter, Zaccardelli called her personally to ask whether or not she had read his letter. Wasylycia-Leis then proceeded to call a press conference to announce that the Liberals were the subject of an RCMP investigation. The effects of this announcement were an almost immediate drop in Liberal popularity and surge in Conservative momentum, as indicated by public-opinion polls. The letter from Zaccardelli to Wasylycia-Leis remains controversial, as it went against standard RCMP policy by publicly announcing that a criminal investigation is being conducted. The controversy is deepened by the timing of the announcement to coincide with a federal election campaign. On February 15, 2007, the RCMP announced the conclusion of the income trust investigation and laid a charge of &#x27;Breach of Trust&#x27; against Serge Nadeau, an official in the Department of Finance. Goodale was cleared of any wrongdoing. Nevertheless, Wasylycia-Leis called for an apology from Goodale.

Wasylycia-Leis also played a central role in the debate surrounding the introduction of additional tax on Income Trusts in the &#x27;Tax Fairness Plan&#x27; introduced by Finance Minister Jim Flaherty on October 31, 2006.

On September 27, 2007, Jack Layton replaced Wasylycia-Leis with Thomas Mulcair as the NDP finance critic. Wasylycia-Leis became caucus chair, and her critic portfolios included health and persons with disabilities. She was re-elected again in the 2008 federal election.

==Race for mayor of Winnipeg==

On April 27, 2010, Wasylycia-Leis announced her retirement from federal politics, effective May 1, without announcing her future plans. On May 3, she filed papers to run as Mayor of Winnipeg in the October 2010 municipal elections. Sharon Carstairs, a Liberal Senator and the former leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party was announced to be her campaign co-chair and Nicole Campbell, a national representative of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, was enlisted as her campaign manager.

Even before she announced her candidacy, she pledged that if she won, she would donate her MP&#x27;s pension to charity; she would have preferred to simply return it, but this is not possible. During her term as a federal MP, she similarly declined her pension as a provincial MLA.

Wasylycia-Leis lost to the incumbent, Sam Katz, by 25,395 votes.

In 2014, Wasylycia-Leis came second in the mayoral race, losing to Brian Bowman.

<doc id="986155" wikidata="Q2957547" url="?curid=986155" title="Four Chaplains' Medal">
<text>The Four Chaplains&#x27; Medal was a decoration approved by an Act of Congress on July 14, 1960 (P.L. 86-656, 74 Stat. 521). The decoration recognizes the heroic actions of four Army Chaplains during World War II.

The statute awarding the medal is listed as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the President is authorized to award posthumously appropriate medals and certificates to Chaplain George L. Fox of Gilman, Vermont; Chaplain Alexander D. Goode of Washington, District of Columbia; Chaplain Clark V. Poling of Schenectady, New York; and Chaplain John P. Washington of Arlington, New Jersey, in recognition of the extraordinary heroism displayed by them when they sacrificed their lives in the sinking of the troop transport in the North Atlantic in 1943 by giving up their life preservers to other men aboard such transport. The medals and certificates authorized by this Act shall be in such form and of such design as shall be prescribed by the President, and shall be awarded to such representatives of the aforementioned chaplains as the President may designate.

Also known as the Chaplain&#x27;s Medal of Honor and the Chaplain&#x27;s Medal for Heroism, its design commemorates the actions of the Four Chaplains who gave their lives in the line of duty on February 3, 1943. The medal was designed by Thomas Hudson Jones (1892–1969) of the United States Army Institute of Heraldry. It was presented posthumously to their next of kin by Secretary of the Army Wilber M. Brucker at Fort Myer, Virginia, on January 18, 1961.

==The Four Chaplains==

The four chaplains were lieutenants in the United States Army: the Rev. George L. Fox (Methodist), Rabbi Alexander D. Goode (Jewish), the Rev. Clark V. Poling (Reformed Church in America) and Fr. John P. Washington (Roman Catholic). In late 1942, the chaplains were transferred to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts, and attended Chaplains School at Harvard University. In January 1943, the chaplains embarked on board the SS &quot;Dorchester&quot;, which was transporting over 900 soldiers to the United Kingdom via Greenland.

On February 2, 1943, the German submarine &quot;U-223&quot; spotted the convoy on the move and closed with the ships, firing a torpedo which struck the &quot;Dorchester&quot; shortly after midnight. Hundreds of men packed the decks of the rapidly sinking ship and scrambled for the lifeboats. Several of the lifeboats had been damaged and the four chaplains began to organize frightened soldiers. They distributed life jackets from a locker; when the supply of life jackets ran out, each of the chaplains gave theirs to other soldiers. When the last lifeboats were away, the chaplains prayed with those unable to escape the sinking ship. Twenty-seven minutes after the torpedo struck, the &quot;Dorchester&quot; disappeared below the waves with 672 men still aboard. The last anyone saw of the four chaplains, they were standing on the deck, arms linked and praying together.

As to official military decorations, each of the four chaplains was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Purple Heart.

==Award creation==
In 1957, The American Legion, at their 39th National Convention in Atlantic City, passed a resolution asking Congress to award the Medal of Honor to the Four Chaplains; however, criteria for the Medal of Honor included &quot;combat with the enemy.&quot; The special medal — intended to have the same weight and importance as the Medal of Honor — was approved by the Senate in 1958, and by the House in 1960. In 2006, The American Legion, at their 88th National Convention in Salt Lake City, passed a new resolution in support of awarding the Medal of Honor to the Four Chaplains.

<text>The Semichi Islands (Samiyan in Aleut; ) are a cluster of small islands in the Near Islands group of the Aleutian Islands, Alaska. They are located southeast of Attu Island and northeast of Agattu Island, near . Named islands in the group include Alaid Island, Hammerhead Island, Lotus Island, Nizki Island, and Shemya.

The Semichi Islands are an important nesting area for red-faced cormorants and glaucous-winged gulls. They also provides important habitat for waterfowl: The Aleutian subspecies of cackling goose nests on the islands in significant numbers, and common eider and emperor goose winter in the area. Black oystercatchers are also found in significant numbers.

<doc id="986182" wikidata="Q94489" url="?curid=986182" title="N-gram">
<text>An &quot;n&quot;-gram is a sequence of &quot;n&quot; adjacent symbols in particular order. The symbols may be &quot;n&quot; adjacent letters (including punctuation marks and blanks), syllables, or rarely whole words found in a language dataset; or adjacent phonemes extracted from a speech-recording dataset, or adjacent base pairs extracted from a genome. They are collected from a text corpus or speech corpus. 

N-gram is actually the &quot;parent of a family of names&quot; term, where &quot;family members&quot; can be (depending on &quot;n&quot; numeral) 1-gram, 2-gram etc., or the same using spoken numeral prefixes. 

If Latin numerical prefixes are used, then &quot;n&quot;-gram of size 1 is called a &quot;unigram&quot;, size 2 a &quot;bigram&quot; (or, less commonly, a &quot;digram&quot;) etc. If, instead of the Latin ones, the English cardinal numbers are furtherly used, then they are called &quot;four-gram&quot;, &quot;five-gram&quot;, etc. Similarly, using Greek numerical prefixes such as &quot;monomer&quot;, &quot;dimer&quot;, &quot;trimer&quot;, &quot;tetramer&quot;, &quot;pentamer&quot;, etc., or English cardinal numbers, &quot;one-mer&quot;, &quot;two-mer&quot;, &quot;three-mer&quot;, etc. are used in computational biology, for polymers or oligomers of a known size, called &quot;k&quot;-mers. When the items are words, -grams may also be called &quot;shingles&quot;.

In the context of Natural language processing (NLP), the use of &quot;n&quot;-grams allows bag-of-words models to capture information such as word order, which would not be possible in the traditional bag of words setting.

== Examples ==
(Shannon 1951) discussed &quot;n&quot;-gram models of English. For example:

* 3-gram character model (random draw based on the probabilities of each trigram): &quot;in no ist lat whey cratict froure birs grocid pondenome of demonstures of the retagin is regiactiona of cre&quot;
* 2-gram word model (random draw of words taking into account their transition probabilities): &quot;the head and in frontal attack on an english writer that the character of this point is therefore another method for the letters that the time of who ever told the problem for an unexpected&quot;

Figure 1 shows several example sequences and the corresponding 1-gram, 2-gram and 3-gram sequences.

Here are further examples; these are word-level 3-grams and 4-grams (and counts of the number of times they appeared) from the Google &quot;n&quot;-gram corpus.

3-grams
* ceramics collectables collectibles (55)
* ceramics collectables fine (130)
* ceramics collected by (52)
* ceramics collectible pottery (50)
* ceramics collectibles cooking (45)

4-grams
* serve as the incoming (92)
* serve as the incubator (99)
* serve as the independent (794)
* serve as the index (223)
* serve as the indication (72)
* serve as the indicator (120)

<text>Havaldar Lalak Jan () (1 April 1967 – 7 July 1999) was a Pakistani military officer and posthumous recipient of Pakistan&#x27;s highest military award, Nishan-e-Haider. Belonging to the Northern Light Infantry regiment of the Pakistan Army, he was the 10th and most recent recipient of the Nishan-e-Haider and was awarded for his bravery and gallant actions during the Kargil War, where he was killed in action.

== Early life ==
Lalak Jan was born on 1 April 1967 in Yasin, in the Gupis-Yasin District of Gilgit-Baltistan. After completing his education, he joined the Pakistan Army on 10 December 1984 and eventually rose to the rank of Havaldar.

== Death ==
Lalak Jan was serving in the Northern Light Infantry (NLI) when the Kargil War began. He volunteered for deployment on the front lines in May 1999. Later that year, his post came under numerous attacks from the Indian Army, which he successfully repelled. He was killed on 7 July 1999 after succumbing to serious injuries from heavy shelling on his position by Indian forces.

According to the official statement:

He was serving in Northern Light Infantry Regiment when skirmishes broke out in Kargil in 1999. Havildar Lalak Jan of the Northern Light Infantry Regiment fought from the forefront to thwart heavy Indian attacks. He volunteered himself to be deployed on the front positions located at the jagged peak in May 1999. Havildar Lalak Jan repulsed back many aggressive ventures by the enemy and imposed colossal losses on them. On 7 July 1999, Havildar Lalak Jan sustained serious injuries as enemies pounded the area with heavy mortar shells. But despite being injured, he retained his position and frustrated the Indian assault. Due to severe injuries, he embraced martyrdom and was graciously awarded the Nishan-e-Haider for his bravery and his will to attack and defeat the enemy at all costs.

==Burial==

Lalak Jan was buried in his hometown, Hundur, in the Yasin Valley, Gupis-Yasin District, Gilgit-Baltistan. Each year, officials from the Government of Pakistan, Pakistan Armed Forces, and local residents visit his tomb to offer prayers and lay wreaths.

==Awards and decorations==
The Government of Pakistan awarded him the Nishan-e-Haider, the country&#x27;s highest honour for extraordinary gallantry.

<text>Jean Daetwyler (24 January 1907, Basel – 4 June 1994, Sierre) was a Swiss composer and musician. He is barely remembered, mostly for his largely forgotten works for alphorn inspired by Jozsef Molnar beginning in 1970. Also inspired by trombonist and other aspects of Swiss culture.

Daetwyler was a pupil of Vincent d&#x27;Indy at the Paris Conservatoire. He returned to Switzerland in 1933 to teach for over four decades. His work was also part of the music event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

<text>Shemya or Simiya () is a small island in the Semichi Islands group of the Near Islands chain in the Aleutian Islands archipelago southwest of Alaska, at . It has a land area of , and is about southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. It is wide and long.

==History==

The Russian vessel &quot;Saint Peter and Paul&quot; wrecked at Shemya in 1762. Most of the crew survived.

In 1943, a United States Air Force radar surveillance, weather station, aircraft refueling station, and a runway opened on Shemya and are still in operation. At its peak in the 1960s, the station, originally Shemya Air Force Base or Shemya Station, had 1,500 workers. In 1956, Northwest Airlines leased Shemya Island from the U.S. government to use as a refueling station on their North Pacific route. According to Northwest&#x27;s website, that made them &quot;the first airline to operate its own airport.&quot; Northwest was operating Lockheed Constellation L-1049G model propliners on its &quot;Orient Express&quot; service between the U.S. and Asia in 1956.

During the height of the Cold War, the United States Air Force airborne intelligence platforms &quot;Cobra Ball&quot;, &quot;Rivet Amber,&quot; and &quot;Rivet Ball&quot; flew intercontinental ballistic missile tracking flights from this island near the Soviet Union, especially the Kamchatka Peninsula. Observations from Shemya were normally the first radar reports of new Soviet satellite launches from Tyuratam (Baikonur) in the early days of satellite tracking; see Project Space Track.

In 1993, the station was renamed the Eareckson Air Station to honor USAF Colonel William O. Eareckson, who had commanded bomber operations during the Aleutian Campaign of World War II.
The station still operates as a radar station and aircraft refueling station with a staff of about 180 people. The 2000 census reported an official resident population of 27 persons on the island.

One of the most recognizable features of the island is the COBRA DANE radar system. This radar was built in 1976 and brought on-line in 1977 for the primary mission of intelligence gathering in support of verification of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) II agreement.

Shemya was an important outpost during the Cold War. As part of Project Bluegrass, the White Alice Communications System provided a vital tropospheric scatter communications link to the mainland during the early-1960s to late-1970s. Its two parabolic reflectors and 50 kW transmitter output bridged the nearly gap to Adak, Alaska.

=== Former airline service ===
Reeve Aleutian Airways (RAA) operated scheduled passenger service into Shemya for many years. During the 1970s and 1980s, Reeve operated nonstop flights to Anchorage (ANC) with Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop aircraft. By 1989, the airline was operating nonstop jet service to Anchorage with Boeing 727-100 combi aircraft which were capable of transporting passengers and freight on the main deck of the aircraft. Reeve&#x27;s 727 service from Anchorage continued during the 1990s as did 727 flights from Adak Island, AK and Cold Bay, AK. Reeve Aleutian ceased all flight operations in 2000.

== Climate ==
The weather on Shemya is very drastic, though the temperatures only vary between single digits to the mid fifties. The climate is perhaps the most equatorward low-altitude occurrence of a polar climate (&quot;ET&quot;) in the world, though it is extremely close to a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;), or a subarctic climate if the 0 degree Celsius isotherm is used. The island weather is most likely to be cloudy with a mist. The wind ranges from . 

The Japanese current in the Pacific to the south of the island regulates the temperature and gives it the pronounced temperature lag. August and September are the warmest months. The island&#x27;s record low occurred in April. Despite it being a tundra climate, it is spared the vicious cold of places like Utqiagvik, Alaska where temperatures in winter can rival those of interior Alaska in winter.

<text>East Ardsley is a village in the City of Leeds metropolitan borough, in West Yorkshire, England. East Ardsley forms part of the Heavy Woollen District and sits within the Rhubarb Triangle.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ardsley&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Erdeslau&quot; and &quot;Eadeslauue&quot;, apparently primarily with reference to what is now East Ardsley as opposed to West Ardsley.

The first element of the name comes from the Old English personal name &quot;Eard&quot;, a nickname form of longer names like &quot;Eardwulf&quot;, in the genitive form &quot;Eardes&quot; (&#x27;Eard&#x27;s&#x27;). The second element comes from Old English &quot;hlǣw&quot; (&#x27;hill, mound&#x27;). Thus the name once meant &#x27;Eard&#x27;s hill&#x27; or &#x27;Eard&#x27;s mound&#x27;. The name first appears with the element &quot;east&quot; in 1459, in the forms &quot;Est Ardeslaw&quot; and &quot;East Ardeslawe&quot;.

== Location ==
Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is south of Leeds city centre and north of the City of Wakefield. Being between several towns, East Ardsley has become a dormitory village. The village is about above sea level and is more widely known than its neighbour West Ardsley.

Although it is in the City of Leeds metropolitan district, the village is in Wakefield&#x27;s WF3 postcode district and its telephone numbers have both the 0113 Leeds and 01924 Wakefield dialling code. In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 4961. On 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished and merged with Morley and Stanley. East Ardsley was part of Ardsley Urban district 1894–1937, which also included Tingley and West Ardsley, and was then part of Morley Municipal borough 1937–1974. The village is still classed as part of Morley in the census, but it is not governed by Morley Town Council.

East Ardsley sits in the Ardsley and Robin Hood ward of Leeds City Council – which elects three city councillors – and the Leeds South West and Morley parliamentary constituency.

==History==
East Ardsley once had a diverse economy, including agriculture, textiles, railways and coal-mining. Its coal mine closed in 1968 – the same year that the nearby Middleton pit closed. On the site of the old pit head now stands the headquarters of Sharp Business Systems, the UK arm of Sharp Corporation, which supplies and services photocopiers. The village had many co-op departments all of which are now closed. The old coop on Thorpe Road changed hands to become Moorknoll Upholstery and after that, Restyle fitness. More recently the property is now occupied by The Mulberry House Beauty Salon.

Amblers Mill is at the crossroads of the A650 Bradford Road, Westerton Road and Common Lane. The building has ceased textile production and now houses Country Baskets. In 2007 the former railway sidings site started to be redeveloped for housing. The owners of the Country Baskets wholesaler were both killed in a helicopter accident on Saturday 26 January 2008.

The M62 and M1 motorways intersect near here. The main A650 road from Wakefield to Bradford also goes through the village. The Bay Horse Pub, a long-standing and historical part of East Ardsley can be found on Bradford Road.

The village was also formerly served by Ardsley railway station.

The entertainer Ernie Wise was brought up in East Ardsley.

==Notable people==
*Ernie Wise (born 1925), comedian
*Eric Fisk (born 1931), first-class cricketer
*Terry Durham (born 1936), artist and poet

<text>Prekmurska gibanica (Prekmurje layer pastry) is a type of Slovenian &quot;gibanica&quot; or layered pastry. It contains poppy seeds, walnuts, apples, raisins and quark fillings. Although native to Prekmurje, it has achieved the status of a national specialty of Slovenia. The unique sweetmeat shows the variety of agriculture in this region. The name &quot;gibanica&quot; comes from the dialect expression &quot;güba&quot; and in this case refers to a fold.

==History==
For centuries, &quot;prekmurska gibanica&quot; was served as a festive and ritual dish in Prekmurje. The exact origin of the recipe is not clear. Early sources suggest that it evolved over centuries. The oldest extant document (1828) by József Kossics described a wedding (Prekmurje Slovene: &quot;gostüvanje&quot;) as never being held without &quot;gibanica&quot;, which is done as follows: &quot;The dough is rolled until thin, sprinkled with grated cabbage, turnips, or quark. All is covered by second layer of dough. It is sprinkled as previously. 10 or 11 such layers are thus composed and form a conspicuous cake [sic].&quot;

&quot;Prekmurska gibanica&quot; was chosen to represent Slovenia in the Café Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006. Since March 2010, &quot;prekmurska gibanica&quot; is protected in the EU as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed.

<text>Adolf Born (12 June 1930 – 22 May 2016) was a Czech painter, illustrator, filmmaker and caricaturist, &quot;known for his murkily-tinted pictures of bizarre fauna, and Victorian gentlemen in top hats and top coats&quot;. In recognition of his lasting contribution as a children&#x27;s illustrator, Born was a finalist for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 2008. His various international rewards and honors also include the Grand Prix at the International Salon of Cartoons in Montreal and the Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters in France.

==Biography==
Born was born in the town of České Velenice on the Bohemian side of the southern border with Austria, moving to Prague with his family in 1935. He received his visual arts education between 1949 and 1955 at the School of Applied Arts in Prague, in the Department of Caricature and Newspaper Drawing. Since the 1960s Born&#x27;s works have been exhibited throughout the world. In 1966, in collaboration with Gene Deitch, Born animated the first ever screen adaptation of a work by J. R. R. Tolkien, &quot;The Hobbit!&quot; Initially better known to the public as a cartoonist published in magazines, censorship prompted him, from 1973 onwards, to focus more on animation and book illustrations. In 1974 Born was declared cartoonist of the year in Montreal, and he won the Palma d&#x27;Oro at the International Festival of the Humor of Bordighera, Italy.

One of the forms he specialised in was the bookplate (the &quot;ex libris&quot;), usually using colour lithography. He held over 100 exhibitions, illustrated hundreds of books, and designed many theatre sets and costumes.

He was married and had one daughter.

The asteroid 17806 Adolfborn, discovered by Petr Pravec at the Ondřejov Observatory, is named after him.

Born died on 22 May 2016, at the age of 85.

<doc id="986268" wikidata="Q5147645" url="?curid=986268" title="Collège des Grands-Lacs">
<text>Collège des Grands-Lacs ( &quot;Great Lakes College&quot;) was a francophone College of Applied Arts and Technology in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was established in 1995 as Ontario&#x27;s third college specifically serving the Franco-Ontarian population, after La Cité collégiale in Ottawa and Collège Boréal in Sudbury.

==Launch and operations==
It began as a &quot;virtual college&quot; which had no central campus, and instead offered instruction through student access centres in Toronto, Hamilton, Penetanguishene, Welland and Windsor. Instructors located in any of the access centres delivered course lectures to all five locations simultaneously through videoconferencing technology, and students outside of those areas could also access the college&#x27;s courses through partnerships with other educational institutions or through distance education.

In 1999, a permanent campus was opened in Toronto, in the Stewart Building at 149 College Street which had recently been vacated by the Ontario College of Art and Design. By this time the access centres in Welland and Windsor were considered full satellite campuses, although the ones in Hamilton and Penetanguishene were still classified as access centres.

In 2000, the college was reported by the media as the subject of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation into a fraud allegation around misuse of government funds, which briefly caused the delay of a federal government announcement of new funding to all three of Ontario&#x27;s francophone colleges. Within days, however, the RCMP confirmed that the college was not under investigation.

Soon thereafter, the college began exploring a proposal to move its Welland campus to the then-proposed new Welland Civic Centre.

==Shutdown==
In 2001, the college&#x27;s board of governors decided to close the college, due to declining enrolment. Some supporters of the college tried to obtain a court injunction against the shutdown, but were not successful. Second-year students were allowed to complete their programs with Collège des Grands-Lacs as it wound down, while first-year students were offered transfers to the equivalent programs at Collège Boréal. The Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities begin negotiations with College Boréal to offer programs in Central and Southwestern Ontario.

The college ceased operations in 2002. Its programs and services were taken over by Collège Boréal, although that college did not take over the Grands-Lacs campus on College Street: initially offering its classes at the Carlaw Avenue campus of Centennial College in Toronto, Boréal moved to its own new campus at One Yonge Street in 2012.

Some community members and the Ontario Public Service Employees Union continued to fight for the college to be reopened under the constitutional principle of respect for and protection of minority rights; the case, &quot;Gigliotti v Conseil d&#x27;administration du Collège des Grands Lacs&quot;, was heard by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2005. The court dismissed the case, ruling that minority language rights had not been violated since Collège Boréal had stepped in to continue offering French-language college education programs in the regions formerly served by Grands-Lacs.

A 2012 report by the provincial Commissioner of French Language Services into French language education in Southwestern Ontario identified both the school&#x27;s original &quot;virtual college&quot; model, which left it unable to truly build a profile as a French-language cultural institution or community hub in the cities it served, and the financial challenges resulting from its subsequent conversion to a more conventional campus-based model, as factors in the school&#x27;s eventual failure. It also found that despite the technological innovation represented by the &quot;virtual college&quot; model, students still valued aspects of the educational experience that can only be provided by a physical campus, such as centralized student services and the ability to collaborate, interact and socialize with other fellow students.

<text>Alaska Commercial Company (ACC) is a grocery and retail company which operates stores in rural Alaska, beginning in the early period of Alaska&#x27;s ownership by the United States into the present. From 1901 to 1992, it was known as the Northern Commercial Company (NCC), and in 1992 it resumed business as the Alaska Commercial Company under the ownership of The North West Company.

==History==
After the 1867 purchase of Alaska by the United States, the firm of Hutchison, Kohl &amp; Company, including Hayward Hutchison, William Kohl, and Louis Sloss, bought the Russian-American Company. In 1868, Sloss, Lewis Gerstle, and August Wassermann bought this company, although Hutchison, Kohl &amp; Company was in simultaneous existence and under the same ownership until 1872, when the new company paid off the purchase. This new company, formed in 1868, was called the Alaska Commercial Company, and did business under this name until 1901. In that year, because of increasing competition in the sealskin trade, the Alaska Commercial Company merged with the International Mercantile Marine Company and Alaska Goldfields, Ltd., to form two new companies, the Northern Navigation Company and the Northern Commercial Company. The original owners of the Alaska Commercial Company, Louis Sloss, Gerstle, etc. carried on the business under the name of the Northern Commercial Company. Shortly afterwards, W.J. Erskine bought some of the old Alaska Commercial Company boats and set up a small successor to the Company in certain areas of Alaska.

The Northern Commercial Company operated village stores in Alaska from 1868 to 1922, including during the Klondike Gold Rush (1897–1899). The stores often served as the village courthouse and post office as well. Much trade in the stores was bartered, as few people had cash. The stores accepted such items as gold, fish and furs in exchange for merchandise. The stores were often the nucleus of small communities and communities often grew because of the stores.

In 1922, the Northern Commercial Company was sold to a group of employees, who moved the headquarters to Seattle. It opened department stores, auto dealerships, and tire stores in Alaska&#x27;s cities, and became a major supplier of heavy equipment and machinery in Alaska. By 1975 the Northern Commercial Company sold its department stores to Nordstrom. The Goodyear tire stores were sold to Bandag. In 1977 the old name, the Alaska Commercial Company (ACC) was reintroduced to the stores and the remaining eleven rural stores were sold to the Community Enterprise Development Corporation (CEDC) of Alaska . In November 1992, the CEDC sold the stores in turn to The North West Company, a Canadian retailer mainly serving northern communities. ACC now has 33 stores in 30 remote Alaska Villages. Northern Commercial retained the heavy equipment division, which continues to operate under the name NC Machinery.

<text>Network SouthEast (NSE) was one of the three passenger sectors of British Rail created in 1982. NSE mainly operated commuter rail trains within Greater London and inter-urban services in densely populated South East England, although the network went as far west as Exeter and also covered the inner East of England. Before 1986, the sector was originally known as &quot;London &amp; South Eastern&quot;.

During the privatisation of British Rail, it was gradually divided into a number of franchises.

==History==

Before the sectorisation of British Rail (BR) in 1982 the system was split into largely autonomous regional operations: those operating around London were the London Midland Region, Southern Region, Western Region, and Eastern Region. Sectorisation of BR changed this setup by organising by the traffic type: commuter services in the south-east of England, long-distance intercity services, local services in the UK regions, parcels and freight. The aim was to introduce greater budgetary efficiency and managerial accountability by building a more market-focused and responsive business, rather than privatising BR completely. It was expected that the London and South East sector would cover most of its operating costs from revenues, in contrast to heavily subsidised rural services.

Upon sectorisation, the London &amp; South Eastern sector took over responsibility for passenger services in the south-east of England, working with the existing BR business units of Regions and Functions to deliver the overall service. Day-to-day operation, staffing and timetabling continued to be delivered by the Regions – and the sector came into existence with barely thirty staff based at Waterloo.

On 10 June 1986, L&amp;SE was relaunched as Network SouthEast, along with a new red, white and blue livery. The relaunch was intended to be more than a superficial rebranding and was underpinned by considerable investment in the presentation of stations and trains, as well as efforts to improve service standards. This approach was largely brought about by a new director, Chris Green, who had presided over similar transformation and rebranding of ScotRail.

The relaunch was marked by the first &#x27;Network Day&#x27;, on 21 June 1986. For £3 passengers could travel anywhere within the Network. 200 extra services were provided and over 200,000 passengers took advantage of the offer. There was a second Network Day on 13 September, and others in subsequent years, though passengers for these required a Network Card to qualify.

Although NSE did not originally own or maintain infrastructure, it exercised control over almost all carrier core functions. NSE set its own goals and service standards in consultation with BR, and created its own management structure and oversight. BR allowed NSE to decide about scheduling, marketing, infrastructure enhancements, and rolling stock specifications on NSE-assigned lines and services.

In April 1990, British Rail Chairman Bob Reid announced that sectorisation would be made complete, with regions disbanded by 199192 and the individual sectors becoming directly responsible for all operations other than a few core long-term planning and standards functions. Network SouthEast thus went from a business unit of around 300staff to a major business operation with 38,000staff and a £4.7billion asset value – large enough to be ranked as the 15th-biggest business in the UK.

Network SouthEast, like each other sector, was given primary responsibility for various assets (rolling stock, tracks, stations), and control resided with the primary user. Other sectors could negotiate access rights and rent facilities, using their own resources. NSE was able to exert much greater control and accountability over both its operating budget and service quality than BR could under its Regions. Relations were generally good between NSE and other sectors, although operating pressures sometimes forced staff to use equipment and assets belonging to other sectors to meet immediate needs.

On 1 April 1994, Network SouthEast was disbanded with its operations transferred to train operating units ready for privatisation.

==Network Railcard==
Although NSE ceased to exist in 1994, the grouping of services that it defined before privatisation remain grouped by the Network Railcard, which can be bought for £30 and which offers a 34% discount for adults and 60% discount for accompanying children after 10:00 on weekdays and all day at weekends (subject to a minimum weekday fare of £13). Holders of annual season tickets for journeys within the Network area, including on London Underground, are issued with a &quot;Gold Card&quot; which gives them similar privileges to the Network Railcard.

==Rolling stock==
==Subdivisions==
NSE was broken down into various sub-divisions.
==Modernisation==

Soon after conception, Network SouthEast started to modernise parts of the network, which had become run down after years of under-investment. The most extreme example was the Chiltern Lines.

===Chiltern Lines===
The Chiltern Line ran on two railway lines (Chiltern Main Line and London to Aylesbury Line) from London Marylebone to Aylesbury and Banbury. These lines were former GWR and GCR intercity lines to Wolverhampton and Nottingham respectively. After the Beeching Axe in the 1960s, these lines became seriously run down with a lack of investment and a reduction of services.

By the late 1980s, the 25-year-old Class 115s needed replacement; the lines had low speed limits and were still controlled by semaphore signalling from the early 1900s; and Marylebone was served only by infrequent local trains to and from High Wycombe and Aylesbury.

Numerous plans for the lines were proposed. One serious plan was to close the line between Marylebone and South Ruislip/Harrow-on-the-Hill, and convert Marylebone into a coach station. Metropolitan line trains would be extended to Aylesbury and BR services from Aylesbury would be routed to London Paddington via High Wycombe. Also the line north of Princes Risborough would close. However, this did not happen as Baker Street and London Paddington would not have been able to cope with the extra trains and passengers.

What did happen was total route modernisation. This was an ambitious plan to bring the lines into the modern era of rail travel. Class 115s were replaced by new Class 165s. Semaphore signals were replaced by standard colour light signals and ATP was fitted on the line and trains. Speed limits were increased to 75 mph (only 75 due to running on London Underground track between Harrow and Amersham), all remaining fast loops at stations were removed and the line between and Aynho Junction was singled. Stations were refurbished and even reconstructed (£10 million spent on stations alone), and signal boxes and the freight depots/sidings were demolished. Regular services to Banbury, and a few specials to Birmingham were introduced and a new maintenance depot was built at Aylesbury. This was a massive undertaking and work began in 1988 and by 1992, the route had been completely modernised, demand for the service had grown considerably and the route had become profitable.

Since modernisation the route has seen further improvements (see Chiltern Main Line).

Electrification was considered but was deemed to be too expensive as the Thames Line sector would then have to be electrified as well. Another reason electrification did not take place was that some part of the line ran on London Underground tracks, which were electrified as 4-rail 660 V DC, while British Rail preferred 25 kV AC overhead traction for lines north of London.

Success of the modernisation implemented by NSE has made it possible for the Chiltern Main Line to compete with the West Coast Main Line between London and Birmingham, and there are now plans to increase speeds and quadruple sections of the line, returning the line to the state it was before the Beeching Axe.

===New trains===
Network SouthEast started a programme of replacing old rolling stock up to privatisation.
* Chiltern 165
* Great Eastern 321
* Great Northern 365
* Island Line 483 (ex London Underground 1938 Stock)
* Kent Link 465, 466
* North Downs 165, 166
* Northampton Line 321
* Solent and Wessex 442
* South London Lines 456
* Thames 165, 166
* Thameslink 319
* Waterloo &amp; City 482 (now London Underground 1992 Stock)
* West Anglia 315, 317, 322
* West of England 159

==Privatisation==
On 1 April 1994, as part of the privatisation of British Rail, Network SouthEast was divided up into train operating units which would later become passenger franchises:

One element of NSE that remained in public ownership was the Waterloo &amp; City Line; too small to be operated as a self-contained franchise, it was not incorporated with the rest of NSE services from Waterloo into the South West Trains operation, and was instead transferred to London Underground.

==Legacy==


Although NSE ceased to exist in 1994, its logos, livery and signage would linger well into the following decades. Southeastern, Southern and First Capital Connect trains continued to run in NSE livery until as late as 2007.

Underground stations on the Moorgate branch of the Great Northern route (Highbury &amp; Islington, Essex Road, Old Street and Moorgate) used to have the NSE era colour schemes after going through 3 privatised operators (WAGN, First Capital Connect and Great Northern) until late-2018.

NSE signage and logos can be found across the Island Line, Isle of Wight, with particularly well-maintained examples existing at the Ryde Pier Head and Shanklin ticket offices. Kew Gardens station in London still has the NSE logo on a plaque in the booking hall marking the station&#x27;s reopening by Michael Portillo in 1989. Marylebone station, also in London, was refurbished by NSE in the 1980s and still has the company&#x27;s logo in the form of three parallelograms in relief over the main entrance.

The last train still in NSE livery was withdrawn on 15 September 2007 when 465193, was sent for revinyling.

In 2002, the Network SouthEast Railway Society was formed to keep the memories of NSE alive by re-promoting through merchandise that they make to raise money for their 4-CIG EMU No.1753 which was named &#x27;Chris Green&#x27; at the NSE 30 event at Finmere, Oxfordshire by the ex-NSE boss himself. On 28 August 2015, the Network SouthEast Railway Society obtained the trademark of Network SouthEast&#x27;s brandname, logo and typeface. The group wanted to obtain the trademark to help Network SouthEast&#x27;s name and legacy live on following its demise and educate about NSE.

In 2017, the Railway Heritage Trust collaborated with train operator Govia Thameslink Railway to recreate the Network SouthEast image at Downham Market station as a commemorative measure. The station has been equipped with paintwork and signage that mimic the Network SouthEast branding of the late 1980s.

Remnants of NSE can also still be seen within the fare system. So-called &quot;boundary zone&quot; fares for example, which allow for cheaper tickets in conjunction with a London area travelcard, are generally only available to destinations within the former NSE area.

In 2025, as part of the Railway 200 event taking part across the whole of UK rail to celebrate 200 years of railways in Britain, unit 465908 was repainted in a Network SouthEast inspired livery (with PRM compliance) to promote the heritage of the former company. The unit is named after Chris Green, the former manager of Network SouthEast.

===Final A (August 21)===
The defining moment of the regatta was Briton Matthew Pinsent winning his fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal, this time without legendary partner Steve Redgrave. The British men&#x27;s coxless four, narrowly saw off the challenge of the World Champion Canadian. The final was stroke-for-stroke, with the lead changing hands and Great Britain won with a time of 6:06.98, 8 hundredths of a second faster than the Canadians. Pinsent later wept at the medal ceremony.

<doc id="986326" wikidata="Q751903" url="?curid=986326" title="British Rail Class 312">
<text>The British Rail Class 312 alternating current (AC) electric multiple units (EMUs) were built between 1975 and 1978 for use on outer-suburban passenger services. It was the last class of multiple unit to be constructed with the British Rail Mark 2 bodyshell, as well as the last class of multiple unit to be built with slam doors in Britain. These features contributed to their relatively early withdrawal at 25–28 years old, compared with a typical EMU life expectancy of 30–40 years.

==Description==
The design of these units was based on the Class 310 used on the suburban services out of London Euston, but were rated for a higher top speed of and they had flat windscreens from the outset. The only significant difference between sub-classes was that the 312/1 units were also equipped to work on the 6.25 kV AC overhead electrification system used on parts of the Great Eastern Main Line and London, Tilbury and Southend line networks.

==British Rail==
As built, the 312/0 fleet were used on the newly electrified Great Northern outer suburban services from London King&#x27;s Cross to Royston. The 312/1s were built for Great Eastern line services from London Liverpool Street. The four 312/2 units were mainly used to enhance local services between Birmingham New Street and Birmingham International, but were also used on other services in the West Midlands.

During the late 1980s, the class received an interior refurbishment that saw the wooden panel interiors covered with fascia panels, the removal of window blinds and other alterations. At the same time units lost their blue/grey livery (312/0) or all-over blue livery (312/1 and 312/2 as introduced) in favour of Network SouthEast (NSE) livery (312/0-1), whilst of the four 312/2 units, 312204 carried West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive yellow and blue livery and the others were dressed in the standard blue and grey, before their transfer to NSE.

At the same time, or soon after, units were reallocated. The Class 312/0 units moved to the Great Eastern Main Line following the arrival of a more modern Class 317 fleet. The 312/1 subfleet consequently moved to the London, Tilbury and Southend line, displacing older Class 302 and 305 units. The section of 6.25 kV on the GEML had been converted to the now standard 25 kV, meaning the exclusive dual-voltage capability of this subfleet would continue to be useful, the line still being dual-voltage at the time.

The 312/2 units would also go to the Great Eastern, replaced by modified 310 units released by the delivery of Class 321/4 units in the West Midlands. These moves were complete by the end of the 1980s, and allocations remained broadly stable until privatisation and the period until withdrawal in 2003–04.

==Post-privatisation==
Upon privatisation, the fleet was divided between three franchises:

===Central Trains===
Central Trains inherited four units, 312725–728. These were used primarily on fast Birmingham New Street to Liverpool Lime Street services and were painted in Regional Railways livery. Their stay with Central Trains did not last long and they were transferred to LTS Rail (since rebranded c2c) in 1996.

===First Great Eastern===
First Great Eastern inherited 24 units, 312701–724. These were used mainly on Colchester to Walton-on-the-Naze and Manningtree to Harwich services and London Liverpool Street to Ipswich and Clacton peak trains. In later years, two former LTS units, 312728/784, were acquired to replace accident-damaged units such as 312707, written off by an arson attack whilst stabled at Colchester station on 11 March 2003.

In 2003, First Great Eastern acquired new Class 360 units to replace these trains. Units were gradually removed from traffic and, by March 2004, only three sets, 312718/721/723, remained in service. A farewell charter train operated on their previous routes using two of these units. The final sets were used on peak trains and were withdrawn on 25 June 2004 after the return of the five Class 322 units, which had been on hire to ScotRail.

With all sets on the London Liverpool Street to Southend service having been replaced by Class 321 units, the last service to survive east of Shenfield was the early morning 12-car service from Southminster to London, where 321 units could only operate in 8-car configuration.

===LTS Rail (c2c rail)===
c2c (operating the London, Tilbury and Southend franchise) inherited 21 units, 312729/730/781–799, which were supplemented later by the four former Central Trains units, 312725–728. These latter units were repainted in Network SouthEast livery, which were some of the last vehicles to be so treated.

The final units were withdrawn from service in 2003, having been replaced by new Class 357/2 &quot;Electrostar&quot; units. Two units were transferred later to First Great Eastern to supplement their fleet, as detailed earlier.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 20 December 1990, unit 312 714 was derailed at whilst working a to service.

== Preservation ==
Vehicles 78037 and 71205 from unit 312792 have been preserved and were at Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire.

Following the closure of the ERM, both vehicles moved to the Colne Valley Railway, Essex in March 2018, taking them back to their native operating area.

<doc id="986329" wikidata="Q1100322" url="?curid=986329" title="Hurricane Jeanne">
<text>Hurricane Jeanne was the deadliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin since Mitch in 1998, and the deadliest tropical cyclone worldwide in 2004. It was the tenth named storm, the seventh hurricane, and the fifth major hurricane of the season, as well as the third hurricane and fourth named storm of the season to make landfall in Florida. After wreaking havoc on Hispaniola, Jeanne struggled to reorganize, eventually strengthening and performing a complete loop over the open Atlantic. It headed westwards, strengthening into a Category 3 hurricane and passing over the islands of Great Abaco and Grand Bahama in the Bahamas on September 25. Jeanne made landfall later in the day in Florida just two miles (three kilometers) from where Hurricane Frances had struck a mere three weeks earlier.

Building on the rainfall of Frances and Hurricane Ivan, Jeanne brought near-record flood levels as far north as West Virginia and New Jersey before its remnants turned east into the open Atlantic. Jeanne is blamed for at least 3,006 deaths in Haiti with about 2,800 in Gonaïves alone, which was nearly washed away by floods and mudslides. The storm also caused 18 in the Dominican Republic, 8 deaths in Puerto Rico, and 5 in the rest of the United States, bringing the total number of deaths to at least 3,037, making Hurricane Jeanne one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded. Final property damage in the continental United States was $7.5 billion, plus an additional $270 million in the Dominican Republic and $169.5 million in Puerto Rico.

== Meteorological history ==
Tropical Depression Eleven formed from a tropical wave 70 miles (110 km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe in the evening of September 13, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Jeanne the next day. Jeanne passed south of the U.S. Virgin Islands on September 15, making landfall near Yabucoa, Puerto Rico later the same day. After crossing Puerto Rico, Jeanne reached hurricane strength on September 16 near the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola, but fell back to tropical storm strength later that day as it moved across the mountainous island. Jeanne moved offshore the Dominican Republic late in the afternoon of September 17. By that time, Jeanne had weakened to tropical depression strength. Even though Jeanne did not strike Haiti directly, the storm was large enough to cause flooding and mudslides, particularly in the northwestern part of the country.

On September 18, while the system was being tracked near Great Inagua and Haiti, a new center formed well to the northeast and the previous circulation dissipated. The system restrengthened, becoming a hurricane on September 20. Jeanne continued to meander for several days (making a complete loop in the process) before beginning a steady westward motion toward the Bahamas and Florida.

Jeanne continued strengthening as it headed west, passing over Great Abaco in the Bahamas on the morning of September 25. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane reached Category 3 strength. Jeanne maintained this intensity as it passed Grand Bahama Island. At 11:50 p.m. EDT on September 25 (0350 UTC September 26), Jeanne made landfall on Hutchinson Island, just east of Sewall&#x27;s Point, Florida; Stuart, Florida; and Port Saint Lucie, Florida, at Category 3 strength. This is the same place Hurricane Frances struck Florida three weeks earlier.

Jeanne&#x27;s track continued to follow within of that of Frances until it reached Pasco County. The cyclone then swung more rapidly to the north, and the center remained over land all the way to the Georgia state line, unlike Frances which exited into the Gulf of Mexico. Jeanne became an extratropical cyclone over Virginia on September 28 and the system moved back into the Atlantic offshore the New Jersey coast the next day.

== Preparations ==

=== Puerto Rico ===
Hurricane Jeanne originated as a tropical depression on September 13 from a tropical wave, just east of the Lesser Antilles. At that time, the United States government issued a tropical storm warning for the entirety of Puerto Rico, about 43 hours prior to Jeanne making landfall on the island. As it moved through the northeastern Caribbean Sea the storm steadily intensified and by late on September 14 Jeanne was forecast to move across the island as a minimal hurricane. As a result, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Ultimately, Jeanne made landfall at 1600 UTC on September 15 as a tropical storm, about east of Guayama.

Prior to hitting, 3,629 people evacuated to 159 schools converted into emergency shelters. Governor Sila María Calderón forbade the sale of alcohol during the storm. All ports around the island were closed, and most flights were canceled. Due to the threat for downed wires, the governor ordered for the entire island&#x27;s power grid to be turned off during the storm. During Hurricane Hugo in 1989, six people were electrocuted to death, which influenced the decision. In addition, ferry trips from the main island to Vieques and Culebra stopped during the storm.

In Vega Baja, an elderly man fell from a roof to his death while installing storm shutters. As Jeanne moved ashore, an eye was in the process of developing, indicating winds near hurricane status, although hurricane-force winds still affected higher elevations. Jeanne quickly crossed Puerto Rico and eventually attained hurricane status in the Mona Passage between the island and Dominican Republic.

=== Leeward Islands ===
On the morning of September 14, tropical storm warnings were issued for St. Kitts and Nevis, while tropical storm watches were issued for Anguilla. During the afternoon, tropical storm warnings were lowered for Saba, St. Eustatius, and St. Maarten, while hurricane warnings were issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Late on the morning of September 15, a hurricane watch was issued for the British Virgin Islands. That afternoon, tropical storm warnings were dropped for St. Kitts and Nevis, while hurricane warnings were lowered to tropical storm warnings for the U.S. Virgin Islands. On the evening of September 15, tropical storm warnings were dropped Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, while hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings for Puerto Rico, and all watches and warnings were dropped for the British Virgin Islands. The entire power grid of Puerto Rico was shut down by the government of Sila María Calderón as the storm approached to prevent electrocutions and infrastructure damage.

=== Hispaniola ===
Tropical storm watches were issued from Cabrera to Isla Saona early in the afternoon on September 14. Later that afternoon, hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were raised from Cabrera to Santo Domingo. Late in the morning of September 15, hurricane warnings were issued from Cabrera to Isla Saona, while hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were raised from Cabrera to Puerto Plata. That evening, hurricane warnings were extended westward from Cabrera to Puerto Plata while hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings were issued from Puerto Plata to Monte Cristi. Late in the morning of September 16, tropical storm warnings were issued from Môle-Saint-Nicolas to Puerto Plata. That afternoon, hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings from Puerto Plata to Isla Saona while all hurricane watches were dropped. Late on the afternoon of September 17, tropical storm warnings were dropped for the remainder of Hispaniola.

=== Bahamas ===
In the Bahamas, the first hurricane watch was issued at 2100 UTC on September 15 and included Acklins and Crooked Islands, Inagua, Mayaguana, Ragged Island, and Turks and Caicos Islands. By 1500 UTC the next day, that hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Simultaneously, another hurricane watch became in effect for Cat Island, Exuma, Long Island, Rum Cay, and San Salvador. The hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning at 2100 UTC on September 17, while the hurricane watch was lowered to a tropical storm watch. Both the tropical storm warning and tropical storm watch were discontinued at 1000 UTC on September 19.

Although Jeanne then tracked away from the Bahamas, the storm was threatening the archipelago again by September 23. As a result, the tropical storm watch for Cat Island, Exumas, Long Island, Rum Cay and San Salvador was resulted at 0900 UTC. A hurricane watch was then issued for the northwestern Bahamas by 1730 UTC on September 23. Around 0900 UTC the next day, a hurricane warning was posted for Abaco Islands, Andros Islands, Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama Island, and New Providence, while a tropical storm watch was simultaneously issued for Cat Island, Exumas, Long Island, Rum Cay, and San Salvador. Late on September 25, the tropical storm warning was canceled. Early on the following day, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning for Abaco Islands, Berry Islands, Bimini and Grand Bahama Island, while the remaining portion – Andros Islands, Eleuthera and New Providence – was discontinued. All tropical cyclone warnings and watches were canceled by 0900 UTC on September 26.
Because Hurricane Frances struck only about two week prior, numerous houses were still patched with plastic sheeting on their roofs, while other residents were still living with neighbors or relatives. Officials urged residents in low-lying homes to evacuate. Shelters were set up at the churches and schools on Abaco Islands, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama. At least 700 people went to a shelter in Abaco Islands alone.

=== Florida ===
Preparations in Central Florida were rushed and sudden, as it did not become apparent that the storm would make a direct hit until the morning of the 23rd. Indeed, it had appeared the storm would pass safely offshore just the night before. Voluntary evacuations were advised on Thursday and Friday, plans for opening shelters on Saturday were distributed to the public, and Florida Power and Light warned that power could be out &quot;for an extended period of time&quot;. Canals were also drained on the same day.

On Friday, the Palm Beach Zoo prepared for the storm by moving small animals and birds into buildings such as restrooms and restaurants. Evacuations began in earnest, with many residents leaving for the Keys, noting that the islands were the only location definitely out of harm&#x27;s way. For once, evacuation to the Keys made sense.

The center of Jeanne&#x27;s eye achieved landfall near Stuart, at virtually the identical spot that Frances had come ashore three weeks earlier, the first time in record keeping that a hurricane made landfall in the same place as a previous storm of the same season. Maximum winds at the time of landfall were estimated to be near 120 mph (193km/h).

== Impact ==
=== Guadeloupe ===
In its early states, Jeanne dropped heavy rainfall in Guadeloupe, peaking at . The communes of Bouillante, Deshaies, and Pointe-Noire were the hardest hit. In Bouillante, 60 homes were damaged. The storm ruptured water pipes in the city of Bois Malher, isolating about 1,000 people. Damage to businesses resulted in 30 employees being laid-off. Crops also suffered impact, especially bananas. At the Malendure resort, which is located along the coast, the pier, restaurants, and dive base were rendered unusable. In Deshaies, 110 homes were severely damaged, including 60 in the city of Ferry. About a dozen boats were beached or capsized. Many roads and bridges were inflicted with damage.

In Point-Noire, nearly 300 single-family homes were damaged or demolished. Three bridges were destroyed, while numerous roads were also affected. Further south in Vieux-Habitants, roads also suffered damage, particularly in the Beaugendre area, leaving a dozen households isolated. A primary school was impacted beyond repairs. In Saint-François, a trench was dug along a major highway to prevent a residential subdivision from flooding.

=== Puerto Rico ===

Upon making landfall near Maunabo midday on September 15, Jeanne produced tropical storm force winds in portions of the island. A NWS employee reported sustained winds of , with gusts to in Salinas along the southern coast. In Cayey, located in the center of the island, a gust was reported, just shy of hurricane force. Additionally, the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan reported sustained winds of . In Yabucoa, the winds killed one woman after she was flung into a wall.

Most of Jeanne&#x27;s impact came from its rainfall. The heaviest precipitation fell on the island Vieques with a total of in three days. There, a 24‑hour total of was reported, a 1 in 100 year event. On the Puerto Rican mainland, the rainfall averaged from , peaking at at Aibonito in the center of the island. At that station, the rainfall reached in a 24‑hour period, surpassing a 1 in 100 year event. Heavy rainfall also fell on the offshore island of Culebra. The heavy rainfall caused severe flooding along many rivers of Puerto Rico, forcing 3,629 people to evacuate their houses in flood zones. The one and only flood-related death occurred when a person drowned in the Culebrinas River in Moca. Across the island, Jeanne produced mudslides and landslides and left $8 million in damage (2004 USD) to the water system; about 600,000 people were left without running water.

Throughout Puerto Rico, Jeanne heavily damaged schools, houses, businesses. Strong wind gusts left 70% of the island without power, and damage to the electrical grid totaled $60 million (2004 USD). The combination of fallen trees, landslides, and debris closed 302 roads and left many bridges damaged. 400 people had to evacuate near the Río Grande de Añasco. The storm left heavy crop damage in the southern and eastern portion of the island, particularly to coffee, plantain, banana, and wheat crops. In Jayuya, the storm destroyed 30% of the coffee crop. Of the $101.5 million crop damage total, more than half was from the banana crop. Overall, more than of croplands were affected.

Overall, Jeanne killed four people directly and another four indirectly in Puerto Rico; damage totaled $169.5 million (2004 USD), making it the most damaging tropical cyclone since Hurricane Georges in 1998.

=== Haiti ===
By September 17, heavy rains totaling about in the northern mountains of Haiti caused severe flooding and mudslides in the department of Artibonite, causing particular damage in the coastal city of Gonaïves, where it affected about 80,000 of the city&#x27;s 100,000 residents. As of October 6, 2004 the official report counted 3,006 people dead, with 2,826 of those in Gonaïves alone. Another 2,601 people were injured.

Decades of deforestation left surrounding valleys unable to hold the 30 hours of rain from Hurricane Jeanne, causing massive landslides. Aid trucks were forced to ford floodwaters and mudslides on National Route 1. In addition, the flooding destroyed all of the rice and fruit harvest in the Artibonite which has been regarded as &quot;Haiti&#x27;s breadbasket&quot;. Some residents had buried unclaimed corpses in their backyards. There were also mass burials of bodies tipped into a massive pit from dump trucks, despite objections to their ceremonious nature and discouragement from the World Health Organization, due to the popular but incorrect belief that dead bodies would lead to catastrophic outbreaks of exotic diseases.

=== Dominican Republic ===

In the Dominican Republic, the storm dumped torrential flooding rains and killing over two dozen. Damage totaled $270 million (2004 USD).

=== United States ===
Millions in Florida were left without electricity, some for the third time in a month. There were five direct deaths in the mainland United States, three in Florida, one in South Carolina and one in Virginia. The final US damage was determined to be around $7.5 billion. It was difficult to isolate this from damage caused by Hurricane Frances (and, around Polk County and Highlands County, from Hurricane Charley as well).

As the storm moved northward east of the Appalachian Mountains, it continued producing heavy rains and flash flooding. Rainfall exceeded 6.00 inches (150 mm) as far north as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, resulting in severe flash flooding in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and its Pennsylvania and New Jersey suburbs on September 28. Tornadoes also touched down in Wilmington, Delaware and Cherry Hill, New Jersey.
==== Delaware and Maryland ====
Throughout Delaware, the remnants of Jeanne produced between of rain, peaking at at the University of Delaware. This led to widespread street flooding and several rivers overflowed their banks. Forty people had to be rescued from a bus along the White Clay Creek after the creek crested at above flood-stage. A strong F2 tornado touched down in the state, injuring five people and leaving $1 million in damages. The tornado touched down in northern New Castle County and tracked for and generated winds up to . The county airport sustained significant damage, five C-130 cargo planes were damaged, thousands of pounds of jet fuel spilled, and damaged hangars. At a nearby industrial park, metal siding was torn off buildings, windows were shattered and power lines were downed. A self-storage facility sustained substantial damage.

In Maryland, Jeanne produced up to of rain, triggering flash flooding throughout the state. Numerous roads were flooded, including parts of Maryland Route 17. Several rivers rose above their flood-stage, with the Big Elk Creek cresting at , above food-stage. A total of 50 roads were closed due to high water throughout the state. Numerous reports of stranded vehicles were sent to the Emergency Operations Center. In Carroll County, a group of inmates required rescue after the jail they were in flooded. One brief F0 tornado touched down in the state near Solomons, causing minor damage.

==== Florida ====

Two tornadoes were spawned by Hurricane Jeanne in Brevard County, both of which tracked through Micco and were of F1 intensity on the Fujita scale. The first tornado moved through a mobile home community, though damage was mainly to trees which were knocked over. In contrast, the second destroyed several mobile homes, resulting in $350,000 (2004 USD) in damage. High winds were reported in the county, with wind gusts of recorded at the National Weather Service Office in Melbourne. Furthermore, it is estimated that wind gusts in excess of occurred in the southern portions of the county. Throughout the county, rainfall was mostly between , which flooded streets and roads in the Palm Bay area. In addition, a man in Palm Bay drowned after driving his car into a flooded ditch. Damage in Brevard County was estimated at $320 million (2004 USD).

High winds also significantly affected Lake County. The highest wind sustained wind speed reported was in Leesburg, though gusts to hurricane force intensity were observed in the southern portion of the county. At least 2,800 homes were damaged, 111 of which were destroyed. One fatality occurred after a 91-year-old woman died in a fire, which was started by a candle lit in her home. Damage in Lake County totaled to $8 million (2004 USD), while an additional $8.2 million in loses occurred to the citrus and nursery industry.
In Orange County, high winds were also reported, with a gust to recorded at the Orlando International Airport. Throughout the county, extensive damage occurred to houses, businesses, and public buildings. Overall, damage was estimated at $40 million (2004 USD).

In Osceola County, hurricane-force wind gusts damaged or destroyed several homes, resulting in $11 million (2004 USD) in damage. Precipitation in the county peaked at in Kenansville, which was the highest rainfall total associated with Hurricane Jeanne. Due to heavy rainfall, flash flooding was reported, especially in the northern portions of the county. Streets and roads along U.S. Route 192 were inundated in the vicinity of St. Cloud. Damage to agriculture was also significant, totaling to an $8 million (2004 USD).
Although the storm made landfall well to the south, Indian River County was severely affected due to the right eyewall passing through. One F1 tornado was spawned by the Jeanne in Vero Beach. It moved near the intersection of Florida State Road 60 and Interstate 95, where it felled numerous trees, resulting in approximately $20,000 (2004 USD) in damage. Rainfall in the county was mostly between , which flooded streets and roads, especially in Vero Beach. The highest wind gusts in Indian River County were at Vero Beach and in Sebastian. As a result of strong winds, more than 49,300 houses were either damaged or destroyed. An elderly woman was injured while evacuating her home; she died from her injuries a few days later. Damage was severest in Indian River County, with estimates of losses in excess of $2 billion (2004 USD).

To the south in St. Lucie County, Jeanne produced tides at an estimated height of above normal. As a result of high tides, marinas were damaged at the Fort Pierce Inlet, which, in turn, destroyed numerous boats. A private residence near the Fort Pierce Inlet recorded a wind gust of . Throughout the county, high winds damage or destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, as well as several mobile home communities. One man was injured when he ran his truck over a downed power line. In St. Lucie County, damage was extensive, albeit less than Indian River County, with estimates totaling to $1.2 billion (2004 USD).

Although the storm made landfall in Martin County, affects were less severe in comparison to the counties immediately north. Along the coast of Martin County, tides were estimated to be up to . High winds also affected the county, with a wind gust of reported in Jensen Beach. Overall, more than 4,180 homes were either damaged or destroyed. No fatalities occurred in Martin County, and no damage figures exist.

In northern Palm Beach County, storm surge was mainly between . 591,300 customers in Palm Beach County were left without electricity. Damage in Palm Beach County totaled to $260 million (2004 USD).

Hurricane Jeanne also affected areas Miami-Dade County, albeit less severely. At Fowey Rocks Light, the C-Man station recorded maximum sustained winds of and gusts to . Winds were much lighter inland, with sustained winds reaching and gusts as high as at Miami International Airport. Rainfall was considerably lighter in Miami-Dade County in comparison to the counties north, with precipitation amounts average between . Overall, 25,100 power outages were reported and damage totaled to $10 million (2004 USD). A National Football League game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami Dolphins was delayed by 7 hours and 30 minutes because of the storm.

Effects from Hurricane Jeanne were reported as far south as Monroe County. The highest winds gusts in the county were at the Sombrero Key Light C-Man Station and at the Molasses Reef C-Man Station. Storm tides were above normal on Vaca Key; it is estimated that tides reaching above average occurred near North Key Largo. The surge of water inundated a parking lot at the Jewfish Creek Bridge. Due to spring tides and elevated waters in Florida Bay, minor tidal flooding occurred at the Key West International Airport. Property damage was minor, totaling to only $5,000 (2004 USD).

== Aftermath ==
=== Puerto Rico ===
Following the passage of the storm, two people died due to carbon monoxide poisoning after running a generator in closed space without proper ventilation. Two others died and another was injured when a tree damaged by winds fell onto their car near Yauco. Due to contaminated water supplies, authorities advised people to boil water before consumption. In the day after the storm&#x27;s passage, electric companies restored power to all but 870,000 people. Most of the western portion of the island was repaired first, as were hospitals and the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport.

On September 17, two days after Jeanne struck, United States President George W. Bush declared Puerto Rico a disaster area, which provided for the cost of debris removal and emergency services. In the immediate aftermath, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funded crisis counseling services for storm victims, set up by the Puerto Rico Department of Health/ Mental Health and Anti-Addiction Services Administration. After the storm&#x27;s passage, FEMA established six disaster recovery centers. Ultimately, more than 206,000 people applied for disaster assistance, including grants for essential repairs and temporary housing. FEMA approved the request for 155,933 people, providing $401.1 million in aid. In March 2005, the US Government provided $14.6 million in aid for reconstruction projects, including repairs to the power grid, as well as general road and bridge restoration.

Due to its damage along its path, Hurricane Jeanne was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in Spring 2005, meaning the name will never be used again for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced by Julia which was used during the 2010 season.

=== Retirement ===

As a result of the hurricane&#x27;s impact, the name &quot;Jeanne&quot; was retired from the rotating lists of tropical cyclone names in the spring of 2005 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never again be used for an Atlantic basin tropical cyclone. It was replaced with the name &quot;Julia&quot; for the 2010 season.

<text>The British Rail Class 357 Electrostar is a class of alternating current (AC) electric multiple unit (EMU) passenger train built by Adtranz until 2001, later Bombardier, at Derby Litchurch Lane Works between 1999 and 2002. They were delivered in two batches at a cost of approximately £292million.

They are the first member of the Electrostar family, which also includes Classes 375, 376, 377, 378, 379 and 387, and are the most numerous type of EMU built in the post-privatisation period of Britain&#x27;s railways. They have the same basic design, bodyshell and core structure as the Turbostar diesel multiple unit (DMU), which is in turn the most common post-privatisation diesel multiple unit family, and both evolved from the Class 168 &quot;Clubman&quot; design by Adtranz. The Class 357 fleet is operated by c2c on the London, Tilbury and Southend line.

== Description ==
The Clubman/Turbostar/Electrostar platform is a modular design, optimised for speedy manufacture and easy maintenance. It consists of an underframe, which is created by seam-welding a number of aluminium alloy extrusions, upon which bodyside panels are mounted followed by a single piece roof, again made from extruded sections. The car ends (cabs) are made from fibreglass and steel, and are Huck-bolted onto the main car bodies. Underframe components are collected in &#x27;rafts&#x27;, which are bolted into slots on the underframe extrusion. The mostly aluminium alloy body gives light weight to help acceleration and energy efficiency. Electrostar units have a shorter version of the Turbostar&#x27;s body.

Class 357 units were built with capability, although the maximum line speed on the London, Tilbury and Southend line (the &quot;Essex Thameside&quot; franchise) is at present only . They all have air conditioning, air suspension, CCTV, standard class 3+2 Chapman seating throughout, 28 computers, sliding plug doors, and rheostatic and air disc brakes, and now have regenerative capacity. As with all &quot;Electrostar&quot; units, they use insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) AC motor drives. They have Tightlock fully automatic couplers but are only interoperable within their own class with other Class 357 units. There are orange LED dot matrix displays at the front of each unit which show the time due at the destination and the name of the destination, e.g. &quot;17.10 Shoeburyness&quot;, or &quot;Not in Service&quot; or &quot;Empty to Depot&quot; as necessary. The time due at the destination updates to the new time due if the train is delayed. There are also LED displays inside, at the end of each carriage above the gangway which give route and customer service information.

=== Class 357/0 ===
The first batch of 44 Class 357/0 units were ordered at a cost of £200million by Prism Rail in March 1997 to replace the slam-door units, and allow the return of 18 hired sliding-door units to their other franchise West Anglia Great Northern. Construction started in 1999, and they are currently leased by c2c from Porterbrook. They were built in the green &quot;LTS Rail&quot; colour scheme, painted with a white livery with dark green doors and underskirt (bottom body panels). Their interior consists of dark green seat moquette with alternating rows of large flecks of light blue and light green, light green plastic seat tops with slots in the side for reservation tickets (which are not used) with dark green insets, a stone pattern linoleum floor, purple plastic interior, light green handrails and metal luggage racks with large circular perforations and light green edges, and dark green stickers on the inter-carriage gangway doors. The &quot;door out of order&quot; display is in between the interior door buttons, with the door close button above and the door open button below, unlike in the 357/2 units. These units were fitted with the voice of Julie Berry.

All 44 units were due to enter service by 1 November 1999, but were marred by late deliveries due to safety certification problems and reliability problems, resulting in the delivery of the units during 2000, and leading to their temporary withdrawal in October 2001. As a result, Bombardier built two further units free of charge, bringing the total to 46 units.

Units are formed of four vehicles, and are numbered in the range 357001–357046. Each unit is formed of two outer driving motors (each powered by two Adtranz asynchronous traction motors), an intermediate motor (powered by two Adtranz asynchronous traction motors) and an intermediate trailer. The technical description of the formation is Driving Motor Open Standard A (DMOS-A)+Motor Standard Open (MSO)+Pantograph Trailer Open Standard Lavatory (PTOSL)+Driving Motor Open Standard B (DMOS-B).

=== Class 357/2 ===

Prism Rail was purchased by National Express in September 2000, and the franchise was rebranded as c2c once the Class 357/0 units were in service. The second batch of 28 Class 357/2 units were ordered at a cost of £92million by c2c in 2000 primarily to replace the remaining units. Construction started in 2001, and they were delivered between September 2001 and May 2002. They are owned by Angel Trains and leased by c2c, at an initial cost of £900 a day (including rental and maintenance). Due to the rebranding, they have a white livery with grey doors, and are internally branded to the c2c purple colour scheme with magenta handrails, magenta stickers on the inter-carriage gangway doors with c2c branding: &quot;culture2club2commuters2culture2club2&quot;, and a light grey linoleum floor with white, dark grey and light purple flecks. The &quot;door out of order&quot; display is above the door close button, which is above the door open button, unlike in the 357/0 units. These units were fitted with DVA with the voice of Julie Berry.

The last slam-door units were withdrawn on 31 March 2003, resulting in c2c being the first train operating company (TOC) to replace its entire fleet with new trains.

The 357/2, have started to receive a refurbishment. This is almost identical to the 357/3, however there has been no seats removed and no grab handles fitted. A similar refurbishment will be placed onto the 357/0.

Units are currently numbered in the range 357201–357211. The formation of each four-car unit is identical to that of the Class 357/0 units. 357212-357228 have been converted to 357/3.

=== Class 357/3 ===

On 27 July 2015, unit 357323 was debuted by c2c in a revised configuration, with wider aisle from 2+2 seating, instead of the common 3+2 arrangement. It also featured the &#x27;refreshed&#x27; internal livery with pink back handles, and grab handles in the gangway. They now feature pink &quot;metro&quot; stickers on the doors and windows adjacent to the doors.
== Livery, problems and maintenance ==
In June 2001, units 357025 and 357027 had vinyl stickers applied with two prototype variants of the proposed purplish blue and magenta c2c livery at Bombardier&#x27;s Derby Litchurch Lane Works. They were delivered to East Ham EMU Depot for evaluation. Each set of vinyl stickers cost about £40,000. Rollout of the new livery on the whole fleet began by mid-2002, and was completed over the next three months. Hence, although the underlying paintwork and interiors of the two sub-classes were different when delivered, their exterior appearance is identical, and the only way to distinguish them externally is by their numbering. When the Quiet Zone car was introduced in each set, this was marked on the exterior of the doors by a magenta and white sticker.

On 19 April 2004, the unusually large rate of increase in atmospheric pressure led to an airlock and failure of hydraulic pressure on eight of the Class 357 trains which caused their computer&#x27;s software to lower their pantographs and so be unable to collect power from the overhead lines, causing service disruption. After their technical problems were sorted out, they have since been the most reliable fleet of EMUs in the United Kingdom, winning Best Modern Era EMU at the Golden Spanners Awards from 2005 to 2007, for an average annual miles per casualty (MPC) figure of 43,180 in 2005, 37,391 in 2006, and 45,459 in 2007 (defined as the number of miles a train runs before a defect develops causing 5minutes or longer delay).

The Class 357 units are all normally maintained by Alstom service technicians at c2c&#x27;s East Ham Depot, which won the Golden Spanner Award for Maintenance Team of the Year (Rolling Stock) at the Annual National Rail Awards in 2005 and 2006 and their Shoeburyness depot.

In December 2005, c2c&#x27;s East Ham depot began putting advertising vinyl wraps on some carriages, starting with branding the MSO intermediate trailer car 74716 in set 357216 as a &#x27;Cough-Free Zone&#x27; by the cough syrup makers Benylin for the winter.

In June 2009, c2c and Bombardier began a repainting programme on the Class 357 units beginning with 357203. When the vinyl wraps were taken off the Class 357 units, slight corrosion caused by water getting trapped behind the vinyl was found in the aluminium around the doors, so a bodywork maintenance and repair programme was carried out. The corrosion was treated by rubbing the aluminium down and repainting it with two-pack paint. More serious corrosion caused by water seeping in through a poorly-sealed join between panels was found behind several panels on the lower part of the vehicle bodysides, which had spread to the outside. A thick, tight mastic seal was introduced between the panels to prevent this issue from re-occurring. To save money during construction, stainless steel bolts were used to secure the external aluminium panels in place; however, this resulted in galvanic corrosion of the more reactive aluminium, so the bolts have been replaced by aluminium ones. Salts in water catalyse corrosion, a problem for the c2c fleet as they run beside the sea.

After repair at Derby Litchurch Lane Works, 357203 was repainted and re-entered service on 30 July 2009. Similar work was carried out on the rest of the fleet over the next 21 months at Bombardier&#x27;s Ilford Depot, where the units were repainted into their original white colour, but with dark blue doors, and branded with both &quot;national express&quot; and &quot;c2c&quot; logos in lower-case. The &quot;Quiet Zone&quot; stickers are now white with sky-blue lettering instead of magenta with white lettering. c2c ran a special &quot;Farewell to the Blue Train&quot; railtour service to commemorate the last day of running in passenger service of the blue livery on Saturday 5 March 2011.

Special liveries include unit 357318 which has a Pride livery for Southend Pride 2022, unit 357008 &quot;going gold&quot; for a Leigh-On-Sea based charity Gold Geese. The gold livery was unveiled on 1 September 2022 raising awareness for Childhood Cancer across the UK and Essex. In March 2023, unit 357016 was unveiled in a special livery for a partnership with the British Transport Police, to publicise their new App &quot;Railway Guardian&quot;. The blue livery features QR codes leading customers to download the new app in order to help improve the safety for passengers travelling on the railway.

=== Regenerative braking ===
On 9 November 2006, unit 357028 was sent to the Velim railway test circuit in the Czech Republic for safety testing to obtain certification for a regenerative braking system which had been trialled for many months on the Class 357 fleet. In March 2007, 357028 returned from the Czech Republic, having gained safety certification, and c2c began fitting the regenerative braking systems to the rest of its Class 357 fleet, becoming the first UK train operator to do so. On 3 June 2007, the eve of World Environment Day, unit 357010 was given an all-over green vinyl sticker livery with magenta doors and the tagline:
&quot;All c2c trains are greener now – find out more at – www.c2c-online.co.uk – c2c – the greener way to go&quot; to highlight the completion of the scheme, which has given energy savings of up to 21%. 357010 lost its green livery in March 2011 as part of the fleet&#x27;s corrosion repair and repainting project.

===Refresh===

On 15 May 2024 it was announced that Alstom would be painting and repairing c2c&#x27;s class 357s over a 24-month period at their depot in Ilford. 

The work includes the repair of huck bolt covers, body end corrosion, side vent corrosion, sole bar corrosion, roof corrosion and the repaint of all the units.

The first refreshed unit, 357207, entered into service on 10 December 2024. The programme is expected to take 24 months to complete with each unit taking 20 days to complete. 

== Operations ==
The two fleets of units are used interchangeably on all c2c services on the London, Tilbury and Southend line. Trains are generally formed of a single unit (4 cars) or two units (8 cars) working in multiple during off-peak times, and strengthened to two or three units (12 cars) during the morning and evening peak times. 71 of the 74 units are required to run the current normal timetable.

Five units were loaned to sister National Express operator National Express East Anglia (then branded &#x27;one&#x27; Railway) for a period ending in 2006 to accommodate the transfer of three Class 321/3 units to Silverlink (themselves to cover for Class 321/4 units hired to Central Trains). The units were generally used on London Liverpool Street to Southend Victoria services on the Great Eastern Main Line (GEML).

=== On-board television trials and Wi-Fi ===
In January 2005, it was announced that an on-train television service would be trialled on unit 357014. The system consisted of six television screens and ten speakers in each carriage, and was also intended to be used to deliver real-time travel information. In June 2006 the &#x27;360 On-Board Television&#x27; service ran into financial difficulties when c2c&#x27;s partners in the project, TNCI (UK), ceased trading, and the equipment was removed. c2c has indicated it will recommence the roll-out should a suitable partner be found for the scheme. The same unit, 357014, had Wi-Fi installed using equipment from Nomad Digital and T-Mobile, and tested for a little-publicised 6-month trial from 14 May 2007. The service was free to use during the trial. c2c have now fitted free Wi-Fi and an on-board streaming service to all of its fleet.

=== Quiet Zone ===
In October 2007, c2c announced that the country-end carriage of each unit (i.e. Shoeburyness end of the trains) would be made into a &quot;Quiet Zone&quot;, where the use of mobile phones and personal audio players is prohibited. The &quot;Quiet Zone&quot; was introduced in early 2008 and is indicated by magenta and white stickers on the outside of the carriage doors and within the carriage. A trial was carried out to install special film onto the windows of the Quiet Zone carriages to block all mobile phone and Wi-Fi signals. The trial was not successful and the project was not continued.

== Accidents ==
On 5 November 2006 at about 00:30, 357043 hit a red Ford Escort which had come off the road and crashed through a boundary fence onto the railway line. The driver of the car had lost control off New Road near the junction with Laurel Close in Leigh-on-Sea. The driver of the car and its passengers left the car before it was hit a few minutes later by the train. A police officer at the site tried to flag the train down before it reached the car but, although the train had slowed before hitting the car, it pushed the car about 100 yards along the line. The train driver and the four passengers on the train were uninjured. The left front valance of 357043 was damaged. There are varying reports on the age of the driver and the number of passengers in the car.

Accidents as well as units 357028 and 357045 being out of service at the same time led to two spare Class 321/4 units, 321408 and 321428, being leased from sister National Express train operator Silverlink for three months for use on weekday peak time services between Fenchurch Street and Pitsea via Rainham, and Fenchurch Street and Laindon to cover for the unavailable Class 357 units. The Class 321 units were used with guards as they are incompatible with the positioning of c2c&#x27;s face-on Driver Only Operation (D.O.O.) mirrors.

Units 357031 and 357320 were involved in a collision in East Ham depot in October 2017. There were regular short-formations between these dates while the trains were sent off to Wolverton for repairs. They later re-entered service in early April 2018.

<text>Emil Holub (7 October 1847 – 21 February 1902) was a Czech physician, explorer, cartographer, and ethnographer in Africa.

==Early life==
Holub was born in Holice in eastern Bohemia (then within the Austrian Empire, now the Czech Republic), to the family of a municipal doctor. After studying at a German-language grammar school in Žatec (Saaz), he was admitted at Prague University where he obtained a degree as a doctor of medicine (1872).

==Expeditions in Africa==
Inspired to visit Africa by the diaries of David Livingstone, Holub travelled to Cape Town, South Africa, shortly after graduation and eventually settled in Dutoitspan near Kimberley to practise medicine. After eight months, Holub set out in a convoy of local hunters on a two-month experimental expedition, or &quot;scientific safari&quot;, where he began to assemble a large natural history collection.

In 1873, Holub set out on his second scientific safari, devoting his attention to the collection of ethnographic material. On his third expedition in 1875, he ventured all the way to the Zambezi river and made the first detailed map of the region surrounding Victoria Falls. Holub also wrote and published the first book account of the Victoria Falls published in English in Grahamstown in 1879.

After returning to Prague for several years, Holub made plans for a bold African expedition. In 1883, Holub, along with his new wife Rosa (1865–1958) and six European guides, set out to do what no one had done before: explore the entire length of Africa from Cape Town all the way to Egypt. However, the expedition was troubled by illness, poisoning of draugh oxen by plant &quot;Dichapetalum cymosum&quot; and, eventually, the uncooperative or even rebelling Ila tribesmen and Holub&#x27;s team was forced to turn back in 1886.

Holub mounted two exhibitions, highly attended but ending up in financial loss, in 1891 in Vienna and in 1892 in Prague. Frustrated that he was unable to find a permanent home for his large collection of artefacts, he gradually sold or gave away parts of it to museums, scientific institutions and schools.

Later Holub published a series of documents, contributing to papers and magazines, and delivering lectures. His early death came in Vienna on 21 February 1902, from lingering complications of malaria and other diseases he had acquired while in Africa.

==Commemorations of Holub&#x27;s legacy==
* In 1884, Daniel Oliver published and described in Hooker&#x27;s book Icones Plantarum (Hooker&#x27;s Icon. Pl.) Vol.15 in table 1475, the plant &quot;Holubia saccata&quot;, a monotypic genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Pedaliaceae. It was named in Holub&#x27;s honour.
* In 1949, a monument to Holub by Jindřich Soukup was unveiled in his hometown of Holice.
* In 1952, Czech movie &quot;Velké dobrodružství&quot; (&quot;Great Adventure&quot;) was filmed about Holub&#x27;s expeditions.
* In 1970, the town of Holice opened a museum dedicated to Emil Holub near the main post office with an associated monument nearby. Since 1999 the gymnasium in the town bears explorer&#x27;s name.
* On 20 February 2002 the Czech National Bank issued a CZK 200 silver coin commemorating the 100th anniversary of Dr. Emil Holub&#x27;s death
* Between 2002 and 2006, the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Harare organized several events to commemorate Emil Holub.
*In a 2005 poll, he was voted #90 of the &quot;100 greatest Czechs&quot;.
* In September 2005, exactly 130 years since Holub&#x27;s first visit to the Victoria Falls, a bust of Holub by the Zimbabwean sculptor Last Mahwahwa was unveiled by the Ambassador of the Czech Republic, Jaroslav Olša, Jr., and the Ambassador of the Republic of Austria, Michael Brunner, in front of the National Museum of Zambia in Livingstone, the city adjacent to the Victoria Falls.

<doc id="986353" wikidata="Q2775060" url="?curid=986353" title="Information leakage">
<text>Information leakage happens whenever a system that is designed to be closed to an eavesdropper reveals some information to unauthorized parties nonetheless. In other words: Information leakage occurs when secret information correlates with, or can be correlated with, observable information. For example, when designing an encrypted instant messaging network, a network engineer without the capacity to crack encryption codes could see when messages are transmitted, even if he could not read them.

== Risk vectors ==
A modern example of information leakage is the leakage of secret information via data compression, by using variations in data compression ratio to reveal correlations between known (or deliberately injected) plaintext and secret data combined in a single compressed stream. Another example is the key leakage that can occur when using some public-key systems when cryptographic nonce values used in signing operations are insufficiently random. Bad randomness cannot protect proper functioning of a cryptographic system, even in a benign circumstance, it can easily produce crackable keys that cause key leakage.

Information leakage can sometimes be deliberate: for example, an algorithmic converter may be shipped that intentionally leaks small amounts of information, in order to provide its creator with the ability to intercept the users&#x27; messages, while still allowing the user to maintain an illusion that the system is secure. This sort of deliberate leakage is sometimes known as a subliminal channel.

Generally, only very advanced systems employ defenses against information leakage.

Following are the commonly implemented countermeasures :

* Use steganography to hide the fact that a message is transmitted at all.
* Use chaffing to make it unclear to whom messages are transmitted (but this does not hide from others the fact that messages are transmitted).
* For busy re-transmitting proxies, such as a Mixmaster node: randomly delay and shuffle the order of outbound packets - this will assist in disguising a given message&#x27;s path, especially if there are multiple, popular forwarding nodes, such as are employed with Mixmaster mail forwarding.
* When a data value is no longer going to be used, erase it from the memory.

<doc id="986366" wikidata="Q956563" url="?curid=986366" title="Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent">
<text>Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent (5 August 130119 March 1330), whose seat was Arundel Castle in Sussex, was the sixth and youngest son of King Edward I of England, and the second son of his second wife Margaret of France, and was a younger half-brother of King Edward II. Edward I had intended to make substantial grants of land to Edmund, but when the king died in 1307, Edward II refused to respect his father&#x27;s intentions, mainly due to his favouritism towards Piers Gaveston. Edmund remained loyal to his brother, and in 1321 he was created Earl of Kent. He played an important part in Edward&#x27;s administration as diplomat and military commander and in 1321–22 helped suppress a rebellion.

Discontent against the King grew and eventually affected Edmund. The discontent was largely caused by Edward&#x27;s preference for his new favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father. In 1326, Edmund joined a rebellion led by Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, whereby King Edward II was deposed. Edmund failed to get along with the new administration, and in 1330 he was caught planning a new rebellion and executed.

Once the new king, Edward III, came of age and assumed personal control of the government, he posthumously annulled the charges against his uncle. The title and estates of the Earl of Kent descended on Edmund&#x27;s son, also called Edmund. When this Edmund died, in 1331, his brother John became earl. Though he was officially exonerated, Edmund did not enjoy a great reputation during his life and afterwards, due to his unreliable political dealings.

==Family background and early years==
Edward I of England had a great number of children with his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, but only one son who survived into adulthood – the future Edward II (born 1284). After Eleanor died, the king married Margaret of France, with whom he had two children who survived to adulthood: Thomas (born 1300) and, when the king was sixty-two, Edmund. Edmund was born at Woodstock in Oxfordshire on 5 August 1301, and was therefore referred to as Edmund of Woodstock. Son of the English king, he was also, through his mother, grandson of Philip III of France. On 7 July 1307, before Edmund had turned six, King Edward I died, leaving Edmund&#x27;s half-brother Edward to succeed as King Edward II.

Though not resident in the two boys&#x27; household, Edward I had taken great interest in the princes&#x27; upbringing and well-being. Before he died, the king had promised to provide Edmund with substantial grants of land. In August 1306, Edward I signed a charter promising Edmund land worth 7000 marks a year, and in May 1307, 1000 marks were added to this. He probably intended to give the earldom of Norfolk to Thomas, while Edmund would receive the earldom of Cornwall, which had been left vacant after Edward I&#x27;s cousin Edmund died without children in 1300. 

When Edward II came to the throne, however, he went against his father&#x27;s wishes by granting the earldom of Cornwall to his favourite Piers Gaveston. According to the chronicle &quot;Vita Edwardi Secundi&quot;, this act was a grave insult to the king&#x27;s younger brothers. Edward II, nevertheless, took steps to provide his half-brother with an income; grants made in 1315 and 1319 secured Edmund 2000 marks a year. In May 1321, Edmund received the strategically important Gloucester Castle, and further grants followed his creation as Earl of Kent on 28 July 1321.

Edward II&#x27;s close relationship with Gaveston had been a source of conflict at court, and Gaveston&#x27;s execution by a group of rebellious barons in 1312 had brought the country to the brink of civil war. As Edmund came of age, he became an important member of the circle around his brother. In 1318, the Treaty of Leake was drafted as an effort to reconcile the opposing parties, and Edmund – as his first public act – was among the witnesses to sign this treaty. 

Further official appointments followed. In the spring of 1320 he took part in an embassy to Pope John XXII in Avignon, where the mission was to absolve the king of his oath to uphold the Ordinances, a set of restrictions imposed on royal authority by the baronage. Later that year, he joined his brother the king in Amiens, where Edward was paying homage to the French king. In October 1320, Edmund attended his first parliament.

==Civil war==
As the political conflict escalated into full-scale rebellion in 1321–22, Edmund played an important role in its suppression. The opposition stemmed from resentment against the king&#x27;s new favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and Hugh Despenser the Elder. When Bartholomew Badlesmere, steward of the royal household, defected to the opposition, Edward made his youngest brother Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in place of Badlesmere on 16 June. In the parliament of July 1321, Edmund briefly sided with the opposition when he agreed to exile the Despensers, but later claimed this had been done under duress, and in November sat on the council that annulled the exile.

In October, Edmund was once more employed in a move against Badlesmere, when he took part in a siege on Leeds Castle in Kent, which was held by Badlesmere. After Badlesmere was forced to surrender, hostilities moved to the Welsh Marches, where Roger Mortimer and others were in open revolt. Once confronted with the royal army, Mortimer surrendered without a fight, and attention turned to the leader of the baronial opposition, Thomas of Lancaster. Edmund, who had taken part in the Marcher campaign, was now ordered, with the Earl of Surrey, to take Lancaster&#x27;s castle of Pontefract. On 17 March 1322, Lancaster was captured after his defeat at the Battle of Boroughbridge and brought to Pontefract. Here, Edmund was on the jury that condemned him to death for treason.

Even with Lancaster defeated, the battle against the rebels was not over. Edmund was charged with overtaking Wallingford Castle from Maurice de Berkeley in January 1323, a task which he fulfilled with great success. For his loyalty, Edmund was rewarded with substantial holdings in Wales, primarily land forfeited by Roger Mortimer. The greater part of the spoils of war, however, went to the Despensers, who both benefited greatly from the forfeiture of the rebels. By 1326, the Despensers, father and son respectively, enjoyed incomes of £3,800 and £7,000, while Edmund&#x27;s annual income was at only 2,355 marks (£1,570).

==Scotland and France==
With domestic opposition largely neutralised, the king turned his attention to Scotland. A major campaign was organised in August, but the effort ended in total failure when the English were routed by the Scots, led by Robert the Bruce, at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322. Edward II himself had to flee the battlefield to avoid capture, and Edmund was with him as the royal army retreated to York. The king&#x27;s inability to handle the Scottish situation was becoming apparent. Andrew Harclay, who had defeated Lancaster at Boroughbridge, and for this had been created Earl of Carlisle and appointed Warden of the Marches to Scotland, signed a peace treaty with the Scots without royal sanction in January 1323. When the king found out, he ordered Harclay&#x27;s arrest. Edmund was one of the judges who passed judgement on Harclay, who was hanged, drawn and quartered for treason. With Harclay gone, Edmund was given responsibilities for the defence of the northern border, but the situation remained untenable. On 30 May 1323, Edmund was on the council that agreed to a thirteen-year truce with Scotland.

Meanwhile, the English king&#x27;s possessions in France were coming under threat from the French king. Charles IV of France demanded that Edward again pay homage for his Duchy of Aquitaine, while at the same time threatening to confiscate the duchy under the pretext of a local dispute involving the priory at Saint-Sardos. In April 1324, Edmund and Alexander de Bicknor, Archbishop of Dublin, were sent to France on a diplomatic mission. While some historians have criticised Edmund for his failure to reach a diplomatic settlement, others have pointed to the difficult circumstances he faced, and how others had fared little better. When diplomacy failed, Edmund was appointed Edward&#x27;s lieutenant in Aquitaine on 20 July 1324. Though there was a desperate need for reinforcements from England, these never arrived. In the short war that followed, the English lands were quickly overrun by the French, and Edmund was besieged at La Réole. Here he held out until 22 September, at which point he was forced to surrender and agree to a six-month truce.

==Deposition of Edward II==
Edward II&#x27;s refusal to pay homage to the French king was based on concern for his royal sovereignty, but also on fear of a potential resurgence of domestic resistance. For this reason, he sent his wife Isabella to negotiate with King Charles, who was her brother. The Queen departed for France on 9 March 1325, and in September she was joined by her son, the heir to the throne, Prince Edward. Isabella&#x27;s negotiations were successful, and it was agreed that the young Prince Edward would perform homage in the king&#x27;s place, which he did on 24 September. Not long after this, Edmund joined the queen and prince in Paris. A circle of opposition was emerging around the queen, including the exiled Roger Mortimer. Edmund, who had previously been steadfast in his support for his half-brother, now joined the plot against the king. Though he still distrusted Mortimer, his hatred for the Despensers seems to have been even greater at this point. When Edmund, along with the others, ignored the king&#x27;s order to return to England, his lands were confiscated in March 1326.
In September, Isabella and Mortimer invaded England with mercenary soldiers, and Edmund took part in the invasion. The invasion won the support of a great part of the English nobility, including Edmund&#x27;s brother Thomas, and Henry, Earl of Lancaster, Thomas of Lancaster&#x27;s brother. Edmund took part in the trials of the two Despensers, and in the council transferring power to Prince Edward, who was crowned King Edward III. For his participation in the coup, Edmund received a reward of land belonging to the Despensers, and the Earl of Arundel, who was also executed as a supporter of Edward II. As the Northern situation was still difficult, Edmund was given joint command of the Scottish Border with Lancaster, but the two fell out, and Lancaster was soon after given sole command. It did not take long for Edmund to grow disenchanted with the new regime; one source of contention was the dominant position at the court of Mortimer, who has been described as Isabella&#x27;s lover. In the autumn of 1328, Edmund and his brother Thomas joined Henry of Lancaster in a conspiracy against Isabella and Mortimer. The conspiracy was a product of shared interest, however, rather than strong personal ties. Once it became clear that it would fail, the two brothers abandoned the venture.

==Death and aftermath==
After participating in the planned rebellion, Edmund became less popular at court. He was still allowed to accompany the king&#x27;s wife Philippa to her coronation in February 1330, but his appearances at court became less frequent. At this point he became involved in another plot against the court, when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive. It later emerged that Roger Mortimer himself was responsible for leading Edmund into this belief, in a form of entrapment. The plot was revealed, and in the parliament of March 1330 Edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor. Upon hearing that the verdict was death, the condemned earl pleaded with Edward III for his life, offering to walk from Winchester to London with a rope around his neck as a sign of atonement, but leniency was blocked by Mortimer and the queen. It was almost impossible to find anyone willing to perform the execution of a man of royal blood, until a convicted murderer (who was said to be responsible &quot;for cleaning the latrines&quot;) eventually beheaded Edmund in exchange for a pardon. Edmund&#x27;s body was initially buried in a Franciscan church in Winchester, but it was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1331.

The execution of a royal prince was a great provocation to the seventeen-year-old Edward III, who had not been involved in the decision, and it probably contributed to the king&#x27;s decision to rise up against his protector. In October 1330, Edward III carried out a coup installing himself in personal control of the government, and Mortimer was executed. Among the charges against Mortimer was that of procuring Edmund&#x27;s death, and the charges against the late Earl of Kent were annulled. In late 1325, Edmund had married Margaret Wake, sister of Thomas Wake, Baron Wake of Liddell, and the couple had several children. His lands and titles descended on his oldest son by the same name, but this Edmund himself died in October 1331. The earldom then passed to the younger son John.

Edmund was not particularly popular while he was alive, nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this. His household was also said to behave in a way that caused popular resentment, taking provisions as they passed through the countryside while offering little compensation. At the same time, it has been pointed out that Edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.

<doc id="986368" wikidata="Q633690" url="?curid=986368" title="Greg Proops">
<text>Gregory Everett Proops (born October 3, 1959) is an American actor, stand-up comedian and television host. He is widely known for his work on the UK and US versions of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;. He has also voiced the titular character on the US version of &quot;Bob the Builder: Project: Build It&quot; in series 10 to 14.

==Early life==
Proops was born in Phoenix, Arizona, and raised in San Carlos, California, a suburb south of San Francisco, attending San Carlos High School. He attended the College of San Mateo and spearheaded the comedy duo &quot;Proops &amp; Brakeman&quot;. Later, he took courses in improvisation and acting at San Francisco State University, though he never finished college.

==Career==

===Improv comedy===
After college, he joined an improv group with Mike McShane. Both Proops and McShane impressed producers Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson, who put them on their show, &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;. He frequently instigated jokes concerning various idiosyncrasies and differences between British English and American English, and would frequently banter with Clive Anderson on these matters (among others). He lived in London for four years when he was doing the show and lists McShane, Richard Vranch and Colin Mochrie among his best friends. After the show ended, he was recalled for the American version and has been a frequent &quot;fourth contestant&quot;. Through 2020, he has appeared in 74 U.S. &quot;Whose Line&quot; episodes, more than any other non-regular cast member.
Proops also appeared in every episode of the short-lived &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Green Screen Show&quot;, where the performers would play improv games (some of which were taken from the show&#x27;s main influence &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;) in front of a massive green screen. Later, animators would draw on the background and other props. In April 2011, &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Improv-A-Ganza&quot; premiered on GSN featuring Proops along with other frequent guests from &quot;Whose Line is it Anyway?&quot; In July 2012, Proops appeared in ABC&#x27;s improvisation show, &quot;Trust Us with Your Life&quot;.

In November 2011, Proops did a week on Royal Caribbean&#x27;s &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot; with the Lewis Black Comedy Cruise Tour. He performed the entire week of stand-up with other artists, which included a live, one-hour podcast in front of his entire audience.

===Film and television===
Proops has performed his stand-up act across Britain, mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand. His other credits include hosting &quot;Space Cadets&quot;, a mid-1990s science-fiction comedy game show on Channel 4 in the UK, which also featured Craig Charles (Dave Lister from &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;) and Bill Bailey, and appearances on BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Mock the Week&quot;. He appeared as a panelist on the 2000 revival of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. Proops has also hosted game shows, including &quot;VS.&quot; in 1999, &quot;Rendez-View&quot; in 2001, and &quot;Head Games&quot;, a Science Channel game show which ran for one season in 2009. Proops also competed on the November 8th, 1984 episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, losing to eventual five day champion John Genova. He would later record video clues for two &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; episodes in 2000 and 2001.

In addition to his stand-up and improv acts, Proops has done voice work in various films and TV shows, including Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, and the miniseries &quot;Stripperella&quot; with Pamela Anderson. Proops provided the voice of Bob in the US version of the TV series &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; for the five seasons of &quot;Project Build It&quot;. He has also featured in 2003 film &quot;Brother Bear&quot; as the voice of one of the Love Bears and provided the voice as Cryptograf in 2006 film &quot;Asterix and the Vikings&quot;.

Proops has been involved with Turner Classic Movies since 2013, appearing on several of the network&#x27;s podcasts and in person at public events. In 2016, he appeared as a television presenter for TCM, introducing comedy films by the Marx Brothers and Wheeler &amp; Woolsey.

Proops has been involved with the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise as well. He played the role of Fode in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. He would later work with the Expanded Universe, reprising his role as Fode in the video game &quot;Star Wars Episode I: Racer&quot; and the video game adaptation of &quot;Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot;, and he guest-starred on two episodes of the animated series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; (&quot;The Mandalore Plot&quot; and &quot;Voyage of Temptation&quot;) as Tal Merrick. In 2018, Proops voiced Jak Sivrak in &quot;Star Wars Resistance&quot;.

Proops appeared as a guest on &quot;The George Lucas Talk Show&quot; during their &quot;May the AR Be LI$$ You&quot; Arli$$ marathon fundraiser.

===Radio and podcast===

Since 2010, Proops has hosted a podcast called &quot;The Smartest Man In The World&quot;, often together with his wife Jennifer Canaga, in which he talks about current events, celebrity culture, and his personal life, usually in front of a live audience. Before &quot;Smartest Man&quot;, Proops hosted a podcast called &quot;The Greg Proops Experiment&quot;.

In 2010, Proops hosted Odd News on yahoo!.com for several years. It was a weekly program where he told weird and funny stories from around the world. Sadly, they all appear to have been removed from yahoo! completely, even direct links from other sites bring you to a page stating that the page you&#x27;re looking for no longer exists. The series seems to have continued in text format and on Twitter for several years after Proops was no longer a part of it.

From 1995 to 1996, Proops presented &quot;Bits from Last Week&#x27;s Radio&quot; on BBC Radio 1. He did voice work for the BBC Radio 2 series &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot;, first broadcast in September 2005. Proops also played the title role in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s sci-fi comedy series &quot;Seymour the Fractal Cat&quot;.

Proops provided the voices for the Harlequin Demon, the Devil, and the Sax Player in &quot;Tim Burton&#x27;s The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; soundtrack and movie.

===Video games===
Proops provides voice-over work as Howard &quot;Buckshot&quot; Holmes, a game show announcer along with John DiMaggio for the Nintendo Wii game &quot;MadWorld&quot;. DiMaggio and Proops play as comical announcers on a brutal game show set in the future.

Proops provided the voice of Matthew Black, a reporter in the forgotten Psygnosis game, &quot;ZombieVille (1997)&quot;.

Proops also provided the voice of Fargus, a pyromantic court jester for the PlayStation &quot;Pandemonium&quot; game series.

He later worked as a voice actor in &quot;&quot;, where he voiced a Brain that was freed by Kaos in order to help perfect his Doomlanders project.

The book is based in part on Proops&#x27;s weekly podcast &quot;The Smartest Man in the World&quot;, detailing the author&#x27;s movie and poetry recommendations, baseball facts, powerful women, and misconstrued history. The paperback version of the book was released from Touchstone on February 21, 2017.

<doc id="986369" wikidata="Q4970873" url="?curid=986369" title="British Rail Class 97">
<text>British Rail reserved the TOPS Class 97 designation for departmental locomotives, which were used for special or engineering duties. They were therefore of several different classes, lumped together for numbering purposes. Some locomotives were converted from redundant engines, whilst others were purpose built. In 2008, Network Rail once again used Class 97 for signalling test locomotives (Class 97/3).

==Allocation of numbers==
Class 97 numbers were allocated in one of three ways:
* Application of 97 prefix to pre-TOPS number – e.g. Western Region shunters PWM 650–654 became 97650–97654.
* TOPS class number replaced by 97 prefix – e.g. Former Class 47 locomotive 47472 became 97472.
* Allocation of number in a series commencing from 97x01, where x represented the engine power Type (1 to 5), &#x27;7&#x27; for ex-multiple unit conversions and &#x27;8&#x27; for diesel shunters.

==Locomotive descriptions==

===97020===
Built by Ruston &amp; Hornsby in January 1957 with the serial number 408493, this 4wDM shunter was ordered specifically for departmental use by the Signalling &amp; Telecommunications department of the Western region at Reading Signal Works. The transmission was diesel mechanical, although the wheels were chain driven from the gearbox and the loco was rated at for a weight of only 17 tons. Tractive effort was a maximum of . Delivered to the WR with the number 20 it was renumbered to 97020 in May 1980. However withdrawal came in April 1981 and it was scrapped on site in August 1982 by Cartwrights of Tipton. For refuelling, it had to go via the main line to the depot at Reading.

===97201===

This locomotive was a former Class 24 locomotive No.24061, which was taken over by the Railway Technical Centre, based at Derby, in 1975. It was initially numbered RDB 968007, and was given its Class 97 number in 1979. It was employed hauling various test-trains until retirement in 1988. It was painted in RTC&#x27;s distinctive red/blue livery, and named &quot;Experiment&quot;. After withdrawal it was preserved on the Midland Railway Centre having been to Vic Berrys at Leicester for Asbestos Removal then later the East Lancs Railway before a spell at the North Tyneside Steam Railway before later moving to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.

===97202===
This was former Class 25 locomotive 25131 used for training purposes at Toton depot. It had been withdrawn on 6 December 1982 and was reinstated as 97202 on 1 October 1983. It only lasted in Departmental service until January 1984 when it was again withdrawn, eventually being scrapped by Vic Berry.

Subsequently, other training locomotives were numbered in the ADB 968xxx series.

===97203–97204===

These locomotives were converted from Class 31 locomotives. The first, no. 97203, was operated by the Railway Technical Centre, based at Derby. It was used to haul various test-trains operated by the centre. However, in 1987, the locomotive was written off after having sustained fire damage. Therefore, a replacement in the form of 97204 was converted. This later returned to normal traffic, as no. 31970. Both locomotives were painted in RTC&#x27;s red/cream livery with a black bodyside band.

===97205===
This was former Class 31 locomotive 31163, currently based at Chinnor &amp; Princes Risborough Railway in Derby RTC livery.

===97250–97252===
Three former Class 25 locomotives were converted for use as mobile generators to provide electric heating on trains where the hauling locomotive could not supply this, including the Caledonian Sleeper. They were referred to as ETHEL units (Electric Train Heating Ex-Locomotives), and unofficially named Ethel 1, Ethel 2 and Ethel 3. They were painted in a blue/grey livery in an effort to match the coaching stock livery of the day, but this was not too successful. All three have since been scrapped.

===97301–97304===

These locomotives have been refurbished from Class 37 locomotives at Barrow Hill Roundhouse by Network Rail and have been fitted with ERTMS signalling equipment. They are intended for use primarily on the Cambrian lines from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth and Pwllheli, which requires an ERTMS-capable fleet. The locomotives were formerly 37100, 37170, 37178 and 37217 respectively. A new inspection shed was built in 2008 at Coleham (Sutton Bridge Junction) in Shrewsbury for these locos.

On 2 September 2009, one of the locomotives (97303) hit a car on an unmanned level crossing near Penrhyndeudraeth, killing the car&#x27;s driver.

On 15 May 2024, 97304 was named &quot;Rheilffordd Talyllyn Railway&quot; at by Peter Hendy, chairman of Network Rail. This was to commemorate 73 years of preservation of the Talyllyn Railway, and the close relationship between the commercial and preserved railways.

===97401–97402===
97401 was a Class 46 &#x27;Peak&#x27; locomotive, bought by the Derby-based Railway Technical Centre straight from British Rail service in 1984. This locomotive did not receive its allocated departmental number and retained its original number of 46009. It was used in a high-publicity test, to prove the safety of rail transported nuclear flasks. The locomotive was deliberately crashed into a container at . Whilst the locomotive was written off, the flask was undamaged.

A second locomotive, no. 46023, was allocated the departmental number 97402. It was cannibalised for spare parts, to allow no. 46009 to reach the required , since Class 46 locomotives are usually restricted to .

===97403–97404===

These two locomotives were converted from Class 46 locomotives (97403 was 46035 and 97404 was 46045). They were operated by the Railway Technical Centre at Derby. 97403 was named &quot;&quot;Ixion&quot;, and was used to evaluate wheelslip. It was painted in RTC&#x27;s red/blue livery. 97404 was used as a source of spare parts. Both locomotives have been preserved.

===97405–97408===

These four locomotives were renumbered from Class 40 locomotives, which had all recently been withdrawn from normal traffic. In 1985, they were returned to use and employed on engineering trains around Crewe, and restricted to a maximum speed of . A major scheme was in progress to remodel the railways around Crewe railway station. After these duties finished, the four Class 40s continued in departmental service working ballast, freight and occasional parcels trains until finally being withdrawn in 1986/87. However, three of the four were later preserved.
*97405 – Formerly 40060, the final Class 40 in departmental service and withdrawn in March 1987, unofficially named &quot;Ancient Mariner&quot;, this locomotive was cut up at Vic Berry in March 1988. 
*97406 – Formerly 40135, later preserved at the East Lancashire Railway.
*97407 – Formerly 40012 &quot;Aureol&quot;, later preserved at the Midland Railway – Butterley.
*97408 – Formerly 40118, later preserved at Battlefield Railway.

===97409–97413===
These five locomotives were renumbered from Class 45 &#x27;Peak&#x27; locomotives. They were used on infrastructure trains in association with major engineering works. All five locomotives were withdrawn by 1988, and have all since been scrapped.

===97472, 97480, 97545 and 97561===

These four locomotives were converted from Class 47 locomotives in 1989, and were used to haul test-trains throughout the country. Number 97561 was repainted in maroon livery and named &quot;Midland Counties Railway&quot;&quot; to commemorate the railway&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

Three of the four locomotives were later renumbered into the range 47971–973, but continued to be employed hauling test-trains. They were later joined by 47974–976 and 47981. The fourth locomotive, no. 97472, was renumbered back to number 47472, and shortly after was withdrawn from traffic due to fire damage.

===97650–97654===

These shunting locomotives were purpose-built by Ruston &amp; Hornsby at Lincoln in 1953 (97650) or 1959 (rest).

===97701–97710===
These battery locomotives were converted from the driving motor cars from former Class 501 electric multiple units, and usually worked in pairs. They were modified by the removal of the seats, sealing of the doors and windows, and flattening of the roof. The locomotives were able to work on third rail and by battery. They were powered by large batteries containing 160 cells, to work four traction motors. Two were based at Birkenhead North TMD and were employed around Birkenhead on the Merseyrail system (97701-702). Others worked around North London and Glasgow.

===97800–97807===
This number range was reserved for shunting locomotives converted from capital stock. Individual locomotives are described below.
* 97800 – This locomotive was converted from a Class 08 locomotive 08600 in 1979 for use as a shunter at Slade Green Depot. It was named &quot;Ivor&quot;, and was later painted in Network SouthEast livery. In 1990, this locomotive was returned to capital stock with its original number.
* 97801 – This locomotive was converted from a Class 08 locomotive in 1978 for use by the Research Department at Derby. It was originally numbered RDB 968020, but was given a Class 97 number in 1979. It was named &#x27;Pluto&#x27;, used to evaluate a remote control system and withdrawn in 1981.
* 97802 – This locomotive was converted from a Class 08 locomotive in 1979 for use at Polmadie depot. It was used for only a year in this role before withdrawal.
* 97803 – This locomotive was converted from British Rail&#x27;s last remaining Class 05 locomotive, no. 05001. It was used on the Isle of Wight railway system, based at Ryde, and was rebuilt with a lower cab to allow it to be used through the restricted-height Ryde Tunnel. It was withdrawn as non-standard, and was replaced by no. 97805.
* 97804 – This locomotive was used at Reading Signal Works following the withdrawal of 97020, and was converted from a Class 06 locomotive, no. 06003. It was made redundant when the works closed in 1984, and was later preserved. It is now the sole-surviving Class 06 locomotive.
* 97805 – This locomotive was converted from a Class 03 locomotive to replace the non-standard 97803. It was later renumbered back to its original number of 03079, and remained in use on the Isle of Wight until 1996.
* 97806 – This locomotive was a former Class 09 locomotive, which was allocated to Sudbrook for exclusive use on the Severn Tunnel emergency train. The train has been replaced by former Class 121 diesel units, and 97806 returned to capital stock with its original number, 09017.
* 97807 – This locomotive was converted from a Class 03 to assist 97805 on the Isle of Wight. It was later renumbered back to its original number of 03179, and remained in use on the Isle of Wight until 1996.

===97901–97903===
This number range was reserved for Battery-Electric shunters on the Tyne and Wear Metro system.

<text>The term blues ballad is used to refer to a specific form of popular music which fused Anglo-American and Afro-American styles from the late 19th century onward. Early versions combined elements of the European influenced &quot;native American ballad&quot; with the forms of African American music. From the 20th century on it was also used to refer to a slow tempo, often sentimental song in a blues style.

== Structure and variations ==
The blues ballad often uses the Thirty-two-bar form of verse-verse-bridge-verse, in contrast to the 12-bar or 8-bar blues forms.

===Popular blues ballads===
The first blues ballads tended to deal with active protagonists, often anti-heroes, resisting adversity and authority, often in the context of industrialisation. They usually lacked the strong narrative common in European ballads, and emphasised instead individual character. They were often accompanied by banjo and guitar and often followed a standard 12-bar the blues format, with a repeated refrain in the last line of every verse. Blues ballads are usually anonymously authored and were performed by both black and white musicians in the early 20th century. Ballads about anti-heroes include &quot;Wild Bill Jones&quot;, &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; and &quot;John Hardy&quot;. The most famous blues ballads that deal with heroes in the context of industrialisation include those about John Henry and Casey Jones.

===Blues ballads in other genres===
From the late 19th century the term ballad began to be used for sentimental songs with their origins in the early ‘Tin Pan Alley’ music industry. As new genres of music, including the blues, began to emerge in the early 20th century the popularity of the genre faded, but the association with sentimentality meant led to this being used as the term for a slow love song from the 1950s onward.

Today the term is used to describe a song that uses a blues format with a slow tempo, often dealing with themes of love and affection. Examples include songs such as B. B. King&#x27;s &quot;Blues on the Bayou&quot;, Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Every Night About This Time&quot;, The blues ballad format is also popular in rock, jazz, and country music, such as Janis Joplin&#x27;s version of &quot;Cry Baby&quot; and country singer Crystal Gayle&#x27;s &quot; Don&#x27;t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue&quot;.

<text>CamCutter is a digital video camera technology developed by Ikegami and Avid Technology for recording broadcast quality video to hard disk, dubbed a Digital Disk Recorder. First revealed in 1995 at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas, it used a camera mechanism by Ikegami and a special FieldPack unit instead of a tape transport unit. The CamCutter outpaced subsequent tapeless camcorders introduced by Sony and Panasonic by years. In October 2010, the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences (NATAS) announced the recipients of the 62nd Annual Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy® Awards. Ikegami and Avid Technology were announced as a winner for the Development and Production of Portable Tapeless Acquisition. Today&#x27;s CamCutter technology can be found in Ikegami&#x27;s Editcam products.

==Features==
Some of the features of being hard disk based was in-camera editing, faster than real time transfer of footage and the RetroLoop, which used a circular buffer to constantly record footage, and allowed saving a &quot;take&quot; after the action happened. This camera technology provides time lapse capture and animation modes (1 frame per trigger).

==Cost==
The price of the initial unit was between US$40,000 to $60,000. Ikegami and Avid developed a follow on tapeless acquisition camera, the DNS201 which shipped in the late 1990s. This unit sold for below US$30,000. In 2000, NL Technology spun out of Avid and continued developing two more generations of this technology. The DNS33 priced below US$30,000 and the hi definition Avid DNxHD camera, the HDN-X10, priced in between US$30,000 and $40,000.

==Advantages==
==Disadvantages==
Due to its huge cost and prototype look and feel, many photographers did not use the initial hardware. Ikegami and NL Technology developed lower cost and more ergonomic versions that sold much better in the late 1990s and through 2010.

<doc id="986381" wikidata="Q1420344" url="?curid=986381" title="The O.C. Supertones">
<text>The Orange County Supertones (a.k.a. The O.C. Supertones, or simply The Supertones) were a Christian ska band from Orange County, California. The band was signed to Tooth &amp; Nail Records and its imprint, BEC Recordings, before becoming an independent band. The band temporarily disbanded in 2005, reunited in 2010 to resume touring and recording, and permanently disbanding in 2017. The OC Supertones were one of the first widely successful Christian ska bands.

==History==
The band began in the early 1990s as Saved. Originally formed by Matt Morginsky, Jason Carson and Tony Terusa while in junior high school, the band played a mix of many styles including punk, rap, metal, disco, and funk. In 1995 they formed as The Orange County Supertones and settled on a ska based sound, similar to Operation Ivy or Mike Park&#x27;s Skankin&#x27; Pickle. Although drummer Jason Carson had known Tooth &amp; Nail founder Brandon Ebel for years, the label was reluctant to sign them. As characterized by Ebel: &quot;The Supertones were good, but Saved was not good. I had years of Saved in my head.&quot;

The Supertones&#x27; debut release, &quot;Adventures of the O.C. Supertones&quot;, received a 1997 Dove nomination for the &quot;Alternate / Modern Rock&quot; category. Their second album, 1997&#x27;s release &quot;Supertones Strike Back&quot;, was a surprise smash hit, peaking on both Billboard&#x27;s Heatseekers and Top Christian Albums charts at No. 3 and No. 2 respectively. In the fall of 1997 the Supertones headlined a tour with Ghoti Hook and Stavesacre, and the next spring opened for Audio Adrenaline, with whom they recorded &quot;Blitz&quot; with on the Audio Adrenaline album &quot;Some Kind of Zombie&quot;, also in 1997.

In late 1998 they embarked on the all-Christian-ska &quot;Skamania 98&quot; tour with The Insyderz and Five Iron Frenzy.
In 1999 the Supertones played for the papal visit to St. Louis by Pope John Paul II.

Beginning with a more traditional ska sound, The Supertones moved next to a harder rock sound, which eventually changed again with more of a pop-rock influence. The band explained the musical evolution to &quot;CCM&quot;: &quot;pop culture has the attention span of a flea... ska&#x27;s time in the white-hot spotlight has come and gone.&quot; When saxophonist Dave Chevalier joined The Dingees in 1998, the band made the decision not to replace his position. Rap and R&amp;B influences also became more prevalent in their sound, which remained &quot;about 40 percent reminiscent of the older stuff.&quot; Their next two albums, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Chase the Sun&quot; and 2000&#x27;s &quot;Loud and Clear&quot;, each charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

Lyrically, they were known as having a straightforward approach to songwriting, with a minimal use of metaphor. Even so, their songs were cited as being thought-provoking and containing deep theology. One of the major focuses for the band was evangelism; they included segments of preaching in each performance. Originally these were fronted by drummer Jason Carson, who had been active in youth ministry before the Supertones found their break. In 2000 when he went back into ministry full-time the band split the responsibilities among remaining members. Adam Ferry, formerly of Plankeye, took Carson&#x27;s spot on drums.

They continued to release albums until 2005, when they announced plans to break up. The band released &quot;Unite&quot;, a greatest hits compilation, and played their last show at Biola University in La Mirada, California on October 7, 2005. Former members Jason Carson, Darren Mettler and Tony Terusa re-joined the band on stage for three songs. Kevin &quot;Slim&quot; Chen was on hand but did not play with the band. The Supertones played for 2 hours at their final show, playing close to 30 songs.

===Hiatus===
On March 11, 2008 BEC Recordings, Inc. released &quot;The Ultimate Collection,&quot; a sort of greatest hits album with select songs from each of the band&#x27;s studio albums, with the exception of &quot;Revenge of the O.C. Supertones,&quot; which has no tracks represented.

On February 12, 2008, former Supertones guitarist Ethan Luck became the newest member playing drums for the Christian pop-punk band, Relient K.

Former front man Matt Morginsky released his debut solo album, &quot;Doctorate in Cold Rockin&#x27; It&quot; under the moniker Mojo &amp; the Info via iTunes and MySpace on April 20, 2008. He also released a CD entitled &quot;Everything Will Be Made Right&quot; with the band October Light, as Mojo and October Light.

Former guitarist Kevin &quot;Slim&quot; Chen now plays in the rock/pop punk band New Liars Club with former members of Gameface and the rock band Follow Your Failure.

Original drummer Jason Carson is founder and senior pastor of Encounter Church in Orange County, California.

===Reunion and second disbandment===
In 2010, The Supertones announced that most of the original members would be reuniting for a handful of dates that year and then going back into retirement. The ensuing tour had fifteen shows, including Joshua Fest in Quincy, CA, Soulfest in New Hampshire and Spirit West Coast in Del Mar, CA. &quot;Reunite&quot;, another greatest hits album, was released during this time as well. At the end of 2010, the band announced that they would continue to play ten or so shows a year going forward.

On March 3, 2012, original members Matt Morginsky, Tony Terusa, Jason Carson and Darren Mettler along with new band members announced progress on the full-length album, &quot;For the Glory&quot; funded via Kickstarter. &quot;On the Downbeat&quot; was released in advance of the album on March 9, 2012, as a teaser. The album released on November 6, 2012.

On March 11, 2017, the band announced plans for a concert on Facebook Live in which they would be performing &quot;Supertones Strike Back&quot; in its entirety recognizing the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, as well as serving as their final performance as a band. Held at Shoreline Church in San Clemente, California, the show was recorded for a live album and DVD release.

<text>The Cash Brothers are a Canadian alternative country/folk rock duo, based in Toronto, Ontario, consisting of brothers Andrew and Peter Cash. Their alt-country/alt-folk music includes ballads which blend acoustic and electric guitar work with vocal harmonies.

==History==
Prior to the creation of &quot;The Cash Brothers&quot;, Andrew and Peter Cash both had established careers as songwriters and musicians. Andrew was a member of the bands L&#x27;Étranger and Ursula, and a solo artist, and Peter was a member of Skydiggers. Although their careers were closely connected (Skydiggers, in fact, often played as Andrew&#x27;s backing band at the Spadina Hotel), they had never written or performed as a duo.

In 1996, however, Peter left his band, and Ursula disbanded. The brothers started writing songs and performing as a duo. Their debut album as The Cash Brothers, &quot;Raceway&quot;, was recorded over time at Chemical Sound and released independently in 1999. It was re-released in the US and in Europe by Rounder Records in 2001 under the name &quot;How was Tomorrow&quot;. The pair toured with a backup band in the UK, Netherlands and the US in support of the album.

Their second album, &quot;Phonebooth Tornado&quot;, came out in 2000.

By the time their album &quot;A Brand New Night&quot; was released in 2003, the pair had toured extensively, and were developing a more electric and pop-oriented sound. They toured in support of the album in the US.

==Touring band==
While on tour, the brothers travel with a backup band. Musicians who have toured with the Cash Brothers include Gord Tough, Randy Curnew, Paul Taylor and Todd Lumley.

<text>Adventures of the O.C. Supertones is the first album released by The O.C. Supertones. Its lyrical content is mostly simple and spiritual, similar to worship music. &quot;Cornerstone&quot; reviewer Don Hill stated that its simplicity was similar to that of the song &quot;Father Abraham&quot;, designed to &quot;draw you out of yourself and into the presence of God like a small child.&quot; Some exceptions are &quot;Blood Washed Pilgrim&quot; which contains direct theology, and &quot;Found&quot; which references Saul&#x27;s conversion to explain the purpose of the band. In the words of the band this is &quot;Preach the Gospel, reach your heart, and ska, ska, ska, ska!&quot; &quot;OC Supertones&quot; continues the explanations, stating their stance on the church and some of the band&#x27;s background. Musically the album contains simple guitar supported by horns, with splashes of reggae, alternative rock, and rap. The latter elements would become more prevalent later in the band&#x27;s later releases. The album&#x27;s first track, in its intro, features a distinct similarity to Metallica&#x27;s version of the Diamond Head (band) track Am I Evil? released on their 1980 debut album Lightning to the Nations

The dialogue introduction for &quot;Found&quot; is from &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, when Doc Brown realizes the Libyans have found him.

Production of the album took about ten days in the studio.

<doc id="986403" wikidata="Q2245247" url="?curid=986403" title="Liz Sherman">
<text>Elizabeth Anne &quot;Liz&quot; Sherman is a fictional character appearing in the &quot;Hellboy&quot; comic book series created by Mike Mignola. A firestarter, she becomes a ward of the B.P.R.D. at age 11 after burning her family to death in a traumatic accident. Sherman later hones her abilities and becomes a longtime field agent for the Bureau alongside Hellboy and Abe Sapien.

In the live-action films by Guillermo del Toro, Sherman is played by Selma Blair and is portrayed as a love interest for Hellboy. Blair reprised the role for the &quot;Hellboy Animated&quot; films.

==Fictional character history==
Born in Kansas City, Kansas, on April 15, 1962, Liz has a normal childhood until her pyrokinetic abilities begin to manifest at age ten. Raised Catholic, Liz feels that the fires are a result of her sins, and for a short time manages to keep them under control by a combination of prayer and force of will. However, in July 1973, at age eleven, she loses control. The resulting eruption destroys a city block and takes the lives of her parents, brother, and pet dog. Liz&#x27;s last uncontrolled manifestation takes place on July 4, 1984.

After being juggled between extended family members following the death of her parents, Liz is taken in by the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense in May 1974, where she learns to control her power to some degree. In 1980, she becomes a full agent. She is often teamed with Hellboy and Abe Sapien. Her childhood trauma leaves her bitter and she comes and goes from the Bureau. During the events of the story arc &quot;Wake the Devil&quot;, while searching for Giurescu&#x27;s body, Liz leads a group composed of herself, Bud Waller, and Leach to the Ruins of Czege Castle. By accident, Liz&#x27;s group comes across a chamber containing the homunculus that is later named &quot;Roger&quot;. Upon inspecting Roger, Liz inadvertently transfers her pyrokinesis into the homunculus. He comes to life and kills Bud before running off. Liz enters a coma as she is taken to Wauer Institute in Tirgoviste. The loss of her powers is causing her body to fail. She is saved when Hellboy finds Roger, who, plagued by guilt concerning the accident, returns her powers.

To learn how to better control her pyrokinesis, Liz lives with a society of monks in the Agartha Temple in the Ural Mountains before resuming active duty in the Bureau after Hellboy quits. As a result of her time amongst the monks, Liz now has complete control over fire: she can produce small flames to light her way, erupt in a furious explosion of fire to destroy anything around her, and manipulate fire into shapes and designs. Her powers are magnified by an ancient object revealed to her in a dream by the mysterious Memnan Saa. This dramatic increase in her powers allows her to burn the towering Katha-Hem entity to dust.

Even after defeating Katha-Hem, Liz continues to be plagued by horrible visions and mysterious dreams featuring Memnan Saa; as a result, Liz loses sleep and becomes more irritable and less reliable. The dreams come to a height during the Killing Ground story arc, where Saa takes advantage of Ben Daimio&#x27;s transformation to fully possess Liz and drive her into a coma until the ghost of Lobster Johnson appears and freed her.

Liz is kidnapped by Memnan Saa and the rest of her team tracks her down. Saa is killed but claims that using Liz&#x27;s pyrokinetic power, he&#x27;d be able to prevent the upcoming apocalypse. Following this, in a mission to the underworld, Saa&#x27;s ghost intercepts Liz and shows her a vision of the future: the apocalypse successful. Under the guidance of a mysterious aged man, she unleashes her full pyrokinetic powers, incinerating the Hollow Earth - and wipes out a combined frog/Hyperborean army gathered by the Black Flame. This ends the threat of these menaces for good but causes devastation across Earth. At first, it seemed as if her powers were completely gone, and she leaves the Bureau as Ogdru Hem awakens across the world and ushers in the apocalypse.

Eventually, her powers returned, more powerful than ever. She soon returned to active duty with the B.P.R.D. and was sent along with a number of other specialized agents into the &quot;dead zone&quot; surrounding the mutant-infested ruins of New York City. The mission ended when Liz managed to engage the Black Flame, now resurrected as a veritable demigod and revealed to be the ruler of the ruins. After a period of furious fighting, Liz was ultimately defeated but managed to escape and her actions enabled the Bureau&#x27;s agents to also escape the various mutants and armed mercenaries in service to the Black Flame and his human followers.

The apocalyptic events plaguing the world came to a climax when the Black Flame, embittered and empowered by personal loss, managed to reach into the void and release one of the Ogdru Jahad, summoning it to Earth and binding it into his service. Liz and Johann Kraus, recently empowered by a connection to an ancient source of cosmic power, were sent to deal with the Ogdru Jahad, with no tangible results. In response, the two were sent back to New York City with the help of a Naval deployment to kill the Black Flame in the hopes of weakening the creature, only to find that the Black Flame&#x27;s influence was the only thing keeping the titanic beast&#x27;s power in check. Ultimately, it was only an act of self-sacrifice from Johann that led to its defeat.

Following the destruction of the Ogdru Jahad, Liz played an active role in the cleanup of the remaining threats wreaking havoc on the world and entered a romantic relationship with agent Ted Howards of the Bureau. The apocalypse resumed however after the destruction of a powerful demon when Rasputin was brought back to the physical world, revealed to have become host to the power of the destroyed Ogdru Jahad&#x27;s power. He was confronted by Liz and the recently resurrected Hellboy in the streets of New York and only defeated at the cost of Hellboy&#x27;s own life. Liz wandered the ruined Earth for some time until called upon by the spirits of Hellboy and Hecate to cleanse the damaged Earth of the Ogdru Jahad&#x27;s corruption. She released her full power, reducing the surface of the Earth to a smoking cinder so that it might begin anew. She was shown to have survived, however, encasing herself in a Hyperborean crystal prison and eventually being found by the descendants of Abraham Sapien that had come to inhabit the restored Earth in humankind&#x27;s absence.

==Relationship with Hellboy==
In the &quot;Hellboy&quot; film series Liz has a romantic relationship with Hellboy. She was taken in as a child so she grows up knowing Hellboy, they eventually become more and both films touch on them working out feeling for each other as well as how their relationship would work with who they both are. The second film has Liz dealing with being pregnant with Hellboy&#x27;s twin children and how that will change their relationship going forward as their lives change due to other plot points. However, in the comic books, Liz and Hellboy are only friends.

<text>Supertones Strike Back is the second studio album released by the O.C. Supertones. One reviewer described the album as a &quot;no-hold-barred modern day revival meeting&quot;.

Compared to the bands&#x27; debut, this release features a refined sound. Attributed to experience and having spent almost three months on production, vocalist Matt Morginsky joked that &quot;we play in tempo and in tune on this one!&quot; The music contains harder guitars and begins to show diverse influences, like surf and R&amp;B.

==Reception==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the album as passionate, saying that &quot;what they offer, in song after ska-punk song, is complete, full-hearted conviction&quot;. Going on to say that the album stood as an example and reproach to the trendy but superficial Orange County ska movement. John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout described the album as more aggressive than their previous album, with louder and harder guitar and moody vocals; praising it as one of the best ska albums available.

<doc id="986413" wikidata="Q15004" url="?curid=986413" title="Hair dryer">
<text>A hair dryer (the handheld type also referred to as a blow dryer) is an electromechanical device that blows ambient air in hot or warm settings for styling or drying hair. Hair dryers enable better control over the shape and style of hair, by accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary hydrogen bonds within each strand. These bonds are powerful, but are temporary and extremely vulnerable to humidity. They disappear with a single washing of the hair.

Hairstyles using hair dryers usually have volume and discipline, which can be further improved with styling products, hairbrushes, and combs during drying to add tension, hold and lift. Hair dryers were invented in the late 19th century. The first model was created in 1911 by Gabriel Ghazanchyan. Handheld, household hair dryers first appeared in 1920. Hair dryers are used in beauty salons by professional stylists, as well as by consumers at home.

== History ==
In 1888 the first hair dryer was invented by French stylist . His invention was a large, seated version that consisted of a bonnet that attached to the chimney pipe of a gas stove. Godefroy invented it for use in his hair salon in France, and it was not portable or handheld. It could only be used by having the person sit underneath it.

Armenian American inventor Gabriel Kazanjian was the first to patent a hair dryer in the United States, in 1911. Around 1920, hair dryers began to go on the market in handheld form. This was due to innovations by National Stamping and Electricworks under the white cross brand, and later U.S. Racine Universal Motor Company and the Hamilton Beach Co., which allowed the dryer to be small enough to be held by hand. Even in the 1920s, the new dryers were often heavy, weighing in at approximately , and were difficult to use. They also had many instances of overheating and electrocution. Hair dryers were only capable of using 100 watts, which increased the amount of time needed to dry hair (the average dryer today can use up to 2000 watts of heat).

Since the 1920s, development of the hair dryer has mainly focused on improving the wattage and superficial exterior and material changes. In fact, the mechanism of the dryer has not had any significant changes since its inception. One of the more important changes for the hair dryer is to be made of plastic, so that it is more lightweight. This really caught on in the 1960s with the introduction of better electrical motors and the improvement of plastics. Another important change happened in 1954 when GEC changed the design of the dryer to move the motor inside the casing.

The bonnet dryer was introduced to consumers in 1951. This type worked by having the dryer, usually in a small portable box, connected to a tube that went into a bonnet with holes in it that could be placed on top of a person&#x27;s head. This worked by giving an even amount of heat to the whole head at once.

The 1950s also saw the introduction of the rigid-hood hair dryer which is the type most frequently seen in salons. It had a hard plastic helmet that wraps around the person&#x27;s head. This dryer works similarly to the bonnet dryer of the 1950s but at a much higher wattage.

In the 1970s, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission set up guidelines that hair dryers had to meet to be considered safe to manufacture. Since 1991 the CPSC has mandated that all dryers must use a ground fault circuit interrupter so that it cannot electrocute a person if it gets wet. By 2000, deaths by blowdryers had dropped to fewer than four people a year, a stark difference to the hundreds of cases of electrocution accidents during the mid-20th century.

== Function ==
Most hair dryers consist of electric heating coils and a fan that blows the air (usually powered by a universal motor). The heating element in most dryers is a bare, coiled nichrome wire that is wrapped around mica insulators. Nichrome is used due to its high resistivity, and low tendency to corrode when heated.

A survey of stores in 2007 showed that most hair dryers had ceramic heating elements (like ceramic heaters) because of their &quot;instant heat&quot; capability. This means that it takes less time for the dryers to heat up and for the hair to dry.

Many of these dryers have &quot;cool shot&quot; buttons that turn off the heater and blow room-temperature air while the button is pressed. This function helps to maintain the hairstyle by setting it. The colder air reduces frizz and can help to promote shine in the hair.

Many feature &quot;ionic&quot; operation, to reduce the build-up of static electricity in the hair, though the efficacy of ionic technology is of some debate. Manufacturers claim this makes the hair &quot;smoother&quot;.

Hair dryers are available with attachments, such as diffusers, airflow concentrators, and comb nozzles. 
* A diffuser is an attachment that is used on hair that is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly. It diffuses the jet of air, so that the hair is not blown around while it dries. The hair dries more slowly, at a cooler temperature, and with less physical disturbance. This makes it so that the hair is less likely to frizz and it gives the hair more volume.
* An airflow concentrator does the opposite of a diffuser. It makes the end of the hair dryer narrower and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot to make it dry rapidly.
* The comb nozzle attachment is the same as the airflow concentrator, but it ends with comb-like teeth so that the user can dry the hair using the dryer without a brush or comb.

Hair dryers have been cited as an effective treatment for head lice.

== Types ==

Today there are two major types of hair dryers: the handheld and the rigid-hood dryer.

A hood dryer has a hard plastic dome that fits over a person&#x27;s head to dry their hair. Hot air is blown out through tiny openings around the inside of the dome so the hair is dried evenly. Hood dryers are mainly found in hair salons.

=== Hair dryer brush ===
A hair dryer brush (also called &quot;hot air brush&quot; and &quot;round brush hair dryer&quot; and &quot;hair styler&quot;) has the shape of a brush and it is used as a volumizer too.

There are two types of round brush hair dryers – rotating and static. Rotating round brush hair dryers have barrels that rotate automatically while static round brush hair dryers don&#x27;t.

== Cultural references ==
The British historical drama television series Downton Abbey made note of the invention of the portable hair dryer when a character purchased one in Series 6 Episode 9, set in the year 1925.

<text>Bradley Sherwood (born November 24, 1964) is an American actor, singer, comedian, game show host and writer. He is best known for his work on the British and American versions of comedy improvisation show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;.

==Career==
His first acting job was a recurring role on &quot;L.A. Law&quot; as Ned Barron, which lasted for six episodes from 1991 to 1992.

Sherwood was introduced to improv after being encouraged to attend a comedy class in Los Angeles, and he joined the cast of the syndicated sketch-comedy series &quot;The Newz&quot; in 1994.

In 1992, Sherwood appeared in two episodes of the fourth season of the British improvisational comedy television show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;. He was the only actor from that year&#x27;s Los Angeles auditions to make it to the cast. In 1997 he returned to the show, becoming a regular performer during the last two seasons. He then joined the American version of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; which began after the British version ended and originally aired on the American broadcaster ABC. The American version was hosted by comedian Drew Carey. Sherwood later made a guest appearance in three episodes of Carey&#x27;s sitcom &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. He was also a producer and performer on &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Green Screen Show&quot; (2005) and a performer on &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Improv-A-Ganza&quot; (2011).

In 2013, the American broadcast network The CW revived &quot;Whose Line?&quot;, on which Sherwood has made occasional appearances.

Sherwood hosted &quot;The Dating Game&quot; from 1996 to 1997 and &quot;The Big Moment&quot; in 1999, and was a guest host on &quot;Talk Soup&quot;. He has also been a regular panelist on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;Jury Duty&quot;, and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;.

He regularly appears on numerous VH-1 series, including &quot;I Love the 70s&quot;, &quot;I Love the 80s&quot;, &quot;I Love the 90s&quot;, &quot;100 One-Hit Wonders of The 80s&quot;, &quot;100 Greatest Rock Ballads&quot;, &quot;I Love Toys&quot;, and &quot;Greatest Game Show Moments&quot;. He was a guest on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and a regular panelist on &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot;.

===Other work===
In 2003, Sherwood teamed up with fellow &quot;Whose Line?&quot; performer Colin Mochrie for a two-man improv show titled &quot;An Evening With Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood&quot;. On March 28, 2007, Sherwood and Mochrie performed at the Congressional Radio and Television Correspondents&#x27; Association Dinner in Washington, D.C.

In 2010–11, Sherwood was one of a rotating group of guest announcers on American TV show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; before George Gray was chosen as the next permanent announcer.

<doc id="986434" wikidata="Q431626" url="?curid=986434" title="Krang">
<text>Krang (also spelled Kraang) is a supervillain appearing in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;-related media, most frequently in the 1987 animated series and its associated merchandise, such as the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures&quot; comic book and many &quot;TMNT&quot; video games. The character has endured as one of the franchise&#x27;s most prominent antagonists and a major foe of the Ninja Turtles.

Krang&#x27;s first comics appearance was in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures&quot; vol. 1, #1, published by Archie Comics in August 1988. In the 1987 TV series, Krang was voiced by Pat Fraley. He also appeared as General Krang in the 2012 IDW comic publication. Krang made his first live action appearance in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;, which was a sequel to the 2014 film, with his voice provided by Brad Garrett.

Krang was created by David Wise, with inspirations from the Utroms, to supply the Shredder with extraterrestrial technology.

In the 2012 series, Krang is referred to as Kraang Prime, and is a deranged Utrom who had mind-controlled most of the Utrom populace into becoming a subservient, rogue hive mind faction known as &quot;the Kraang&quot;.

In &quot;Rise of the TMNT: The Movie&quot;, Krang is referred to as Krang Leader (credited as Krang One), who leads his siblings, Krang Sister (credited as Krang Two) and Krang Brother (credited as Krang Three).

== Abilities ==
In the final season of the 1987 animated series, Krang showed signs of psychic powers when he hypnotized one of Lord Dregg&#x27;s soldiers into obeying his and Shredder&#x27;s commands, saying it would only work on weak-willed people.

Throughout the rest of the show, as well as most other appearances, Krang&#x27;s most notable combat ability is weaponry which he can switch his android bodies hands out for - his most commonly seen weapons are swords, maces, and blasters.

== Relating to the Utroms ==
Krang&#x27;s physical appearance was inspired by the Utroms from the original &quot;TMNT&quot; comic book. In several subsequent series, such as the 2012 IDW comic series, he is himself a member of the Utrom species.

== 1987 series ==

Prior to the start of the 1987 cartoon, Krang was a reptilian creature in command of an army of Rock Soldiers under the leadership of General Traag, and took the completed station called the Technodrome, a powerful mobile battle fortress, and banished Von Drakus, who helped Krang build it, to Earth. When he was banished from Dimension X, Krang was stripped of his body and reduced to a brain-like form forced to use small android walkers and/or small platforms to move.

While on Earth, Krang allied himself with the Shredder, who, along with his robotic Foot Soldier army, moved into the Technodrome. In exchange, the Shredder had to design and build a new body for Krang, a human-shaped exo-suit referred to as his &quot;android body&quot;, which he eventually turns giant and uses to attack the turtles. Shredder lived up to his part of the bargain in the season 1 episode &quot;Shredder &amp; Splintered&quot;, in no small part because he was unable to deal with the Turtles and needed Krang&#x27;s help. In the season 3 episode &quot;Shredderville&quot;, the Turtles have a dream of a parallel world in which they never lived, and Shredder had no problem taking over the world; in that world, Shredder abandoned Krang after his conquest was complete, leaving him with no body and a heavily-damaged Technodrome.

Krang&#x27;s ultimate goal is to take over the Earth; it probably only became his objective after he was exiled on the Earth, but this point is never made clear. Every plan Krang conceives is either aimed at that goal, or towards the short-term objective of powering-up the Technodrome. He does not share Shredder&#x27;s obsession with the Turtles and Splinter; while Shredder sees them as mortal enemies, Krang seems to regard them more like annoyances to be destroyed when they interfere in his plans. He does have his own &quot;version&quot; of the turtles, however—a rebellious group of teens from Dimension X named the Neutrinos, who seem to have a very similar relationship to Krang as Shredder has to the TMNT.

Counting from the first meeting between the Turtles and Shredder and Krang, Krang spent seven seasons in the Technodrome, either somewhere on Earth or in Dimension X, scheming to power up his battle fortress and take over the Earth. Eventually the Turtles managed to banish the Technodrome back to Dimension X without Krang and Shredder. At that point they began operating out of an old science building. Krang and Shredder eventually returned to the Technodrome in the season 8 episode &quot;Turtle Trek&quot;, but the Turtles destroy the engines of the Technodrome, trapping it and its inhabitants in Dimension X and putting an end to Krang&#x27;s plans.

Krang spent the next two years in Dimension X, until he was contacted by Dregg. Dregg arranged for him and Shredder to come back to Earth, to help him fight the Turtles. However, Dregg betrays them, and drains Krang&#x27;s intelligence. Shredder escapes and restores Krang, but Dregg captures them again. Finally, the Turtles spoil his plan and transport Shredder and Krang back to Dimension X.

In the series finale, &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot;, the Turtles return to the Technodrome to take Krang&#x27;s android body, which they need to fight Dregg. Krang is nowhere to be seen, but it is assumed that he is still somewhere in Dimension X.

==IDW Comics==
In the IDW Comics, Krang is both an Utrom and a denizen of Dimension X. He is the heir of Quanin, the former Prime Minister of the Utroms&#x27; ruling council who appointed himself Emperor and aggressively expanded the Utrom domain into an empire. However, his megalomanic expansion drive both deprived his home planet of its most essential natural resource, the Ooze, and incited rebellion among the subjugated people of Dimension X, eventually leading to the destruction of Utrominon. Krang, who was as brutal as his father but opposed his uncautious politics, fled with a few survivors of his people through an interdimensional portal to Burnow Island on Earth, where he established a base from which he intended to terraform this world into a new home for his people, which he calls &quot;new Utrominon&quot;.

In order to augment his troops, Krang, initially disguised as a despotic human warlord, forms a business relationship with Baxter Stockman, head of the genetics research institute Stock Gen, and supplies him with Ooze, which could be used as a natural mutagen on Earth&#x27;s organisms. Krang seeks this mutagen to use in healing the surviving utroms he took with him from Utrominon. It is through Stockman&#x27;s experiments that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Splinter evolve into intelligent, humanoid mutants. When the Turtles learn of Krang&#x27;s genocidal plans thanks to their human friend April O&#x27;Neil, a former intern at Stock Gen, they, together with their ally, the Fugitoid (a former Neutrino scientist whose mind is trapped in a robot body and who was forcibly conscripted by Krang to complete his terraforming machine, the Technodrome), and the Foot Clan stop Krang from destroying the Earth, and the Utrom warlord is surrendered to the Neutrinos for trial for his numerous war crimes.

While imprisoned on Neutrino, Kraang hires the bounty hunter Hakk-R to eliminate several material witnesses in order to get the trial cancelled, but Hakk-R fails thanks to the efforts of the Turtles. Eventually, Krang is found guilty and sentenced to permanent exile from Dimension X on Earth. However, Leatherhead, one of his former victims and a key witness in the trial, refuses to accept the mild verdict and kills Krang by devouring him. However, as the Fugitoid belatedly realizes, the Utroms possess a natural parasitic physiology, enabling Krang to regenerate himself and take possession of Leatherhead&#x27;s body. He later joins Baxter Stockman and Madame Null in their alliance with the Rat King to bring about the demigod&#x27;s &quot;Armageddon Game&quot;, and receives a restored Metalhead as a new exobody. He stil continues to work on his own schemes, but his leadership of the Utroms is usurped by his former subordinate Ch&#x27;rell, and he is executed by King Zenter before he can destroy the Earth out of spite.

==2003 series==
Krang makes a small cameo appearance in the episode &quot;Secret Origins Part 3&quot; of the 2003 series. As the Utroms are all walking to the transmat to go back home, one of them complains, &quot;I hate walking on my tentacles,&quot; to which another Utrom replies, &quot;Oh, shut up, Krang!&quot;. This Krang was voiced by Wayne Grayson. Ch&#x27;rell the evil Utrom serves as a sole heartless version of Krang and Oroku Saki.

Krang also appears in the 2009 crossover film, &quot;Turtles Forever&quot;, in which he, Shredder and the Turtles from the 1987 show end up in the 2003 universe. Although Shredder was able to find his 2003 counterpart, he was unable to find Krang&#x27;s, even though he exists in this universe (albeit as a regular, non-evil Utrom). Krang is voiced here by Bradford Cameron.

==2012 series==
An alien species based on both Krang and the Utroms appear in the 2012 Nickelodeon show, named The Kraang. Kraang Prime is the leader of the hive mind and was a normal Utrom scientist until he made the mutagen, which he used to mutate himself into Kraang Prime. He then used his powers to enslave most of the Utroms into becoming hive-mind slaves. In the 40th Anniversary Comics Celebration, it is revealed that after his final defeat, Kraang prime&#x27;s cells survived and began to absorb every living being it came across, eventually developing a consciousness and taking a humanoid form, renaming itself Kraang Primordius with the intent to consume everything.

Given the series introduces the 1987 show as an alternate universe, the original Krang makes an appearance, still voiced by Pat Fraley, being said to be a cousin of Kraang Sub-Prime who wound up exiled to that dimension because he was a screw-up. He attempted to destroy the Mirage, 1987, and 2012 universes, the latter of which the Kraang had especially been trying to conquer, using Sub-Prime&#x27;s desire to &quot;wipe out the Turtles at any cost&quot; as leverage. Sub-Prime banishes him back to the 1987-universe once this is revealed, as this incompetence was why Krang was banished in the first place (the fact about the 1987 Krang being a cousin and his exile is non-canon to the 1987 series).

The Kraang are voiced by Nolan North, who had previously voiced Raphael in the 2007 TMNT film, and Kraang Prime was initially voiced by Roseanne Barr and later by Rachael Butera. Kraang Sub-Prime is voiced by Gilbert Gottfried and Patrick Fraley reprises his role of Krang from the 1987 series.

==2018 series==

In the series &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and its Netflix film sequel &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie&quot;, the Krang is an alien species that landed on ancient Earth bringing with them a mutagen known as Empyrean, which created the Yōkai race. During feudal times in Japan, the Krang gifted Oroku Saki, leader of the Foot Clan, with the dark armor Kuroi Yōroi, which allowed Saki to defeat the Foot&#x27;s enemies, but ended up possessing and transforming him into the evil Shredder and leading the Foot clan into worshiping them. Eventually a group of warriors who created the mystic weapon key and used it to banish them into another realm for a thousand years. During the series finale, Shredder unearths the remains of a Krang inside a buried ship while looking for Empyrean to fulfill his goals. By the time the Foot opens the portal to set them free, only three of them have survived their exile, they then possess the members of the Foot Clan and turn them into monstrous minions (with the same fate later befalling Raph, until Leo snaps him out of it) and proceed to take over the highest building of the city in order to open a portal big enough for their ship Technodrome to crossover.

Unlike the previous versions of the Krang who mostly relied on their intellect, this version is more powerful and deadly and is capable of fighting without the use of any kind of tech and are virtually unstoppable in their suits. Their method of mutation also greatly differs from prior incarnations in that they utilise a form of bio-growth that usually takes over or otherwise transmutates anything it touches, to the point that it can puppeteer inorganic matter. Their members include the mastermind behind their plan who leads the other two, a female Krang who leads the possessed slaves into battle and has a temper, and a silent one who is in charge of spreading the bio-growth, creating the portal and piloting the Technodrome (Which in this series is techno-organic). The female one lost her right eye at the hands of April and was defeated by her, Splinter and Casey Jones and later captured by humans, the silent one was restrained by Donatello when he seized control of Technodrome and presumably destroyed with the ship and the leader was exiled again at the hands of Leonardo.

Krang Leader is voiced by Jim Pirri and Krang Two is voiced by Toks Olagundoye.

==Film==
Brad Garrett voices Krang in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;, where it was the first official live-action appearance of the character. This version looks accurate to his comics version in terms of him being a large brain with facial features, though his robot is more gray and robotic. It also has thin strips of plating that look like skin, a reference to the extremely humanoid design employed by the comics version. Fred Armisen was originally going to voice the character, but scheduling conflicts made him unavailable.

==Video games==
In &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up&quot;, one of the players is a Utrominator drone, a Utrom enslaved by Shredder in the 2003 series, despite not actually being Krang, he acts as a stand-in for him.

The Kraang are one of the enemies in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;, where the Turtles infiltrate the TCRI building in search for the Shredder, who has been stealing their technology for Baxter Stockman to invent him a telepathic helmet as a way to defeat the Turtles.

General Krang is the secondary antagonist in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan&quot;, where he teams up with Shredder to distract the Turtles so his Foot Soldiers and mutant allies can collect alien parts to construct a giant portal to Dimension X, to which Krang will initiate a invasion against Earth.

In &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, Krang&#x27;s android body parts are scattered for the villains try to repair, however this was actually a distraction to where he is actually turning the Statue of Liberty into a new body called the &quot;Statue of Tyranny&quot;.

<doc id="986438" wikidata="Q6685927" url="?curid=986438" title="Loud and Clear (The O.C. Supertones album)">
<text>Loud and Clear is the fourth studio album released by The O.C. Supertones and features Toby Mac on the song &quot;What It Comes To&quot;. This is also the band&#x27;s first album to include guitarist Ethan Luck. Although Luck was not pictured, he is listed under &quot;additional musicians&quot; in the credits; he did not officially join the band until after the album was finished. Drummer Jason Carson left the band after the release of the album to take a position in youth ministry. However, he returned with the band in 2010 after their hiatus.

Musically the album integrates scratching and hip-hop vocal delivery with their brand of ska. The songwriting was handled primarily by Morginsky and Terusa, and was considered more advanced than on previous albums. Themes range from apologetics to doubting God, but still contain elements of praise and worship and pop culture.

<doc id="986451" wikidata="Q595121" url="?curid=986451" title="Gonarezhou National Park">
<text>Gonarezhou National Park is a national park located in southeastern Zimbabwe. It is situated in a relatively remote corner of Masvingo Province, south of Chimanimani along the Mozambique border. Owing to its vast size, rugged terrain and its location away from main tourist routes, large tracts of Gonarezhou remain pristine wilderness.

At 5,053 km2, Gonarezhou is the country&#x27;s second-largest national park, after Hwange National Park. The name &quot;Gonarezhou&quot; is translated from the Shona meaning &quot;The Place of Elephants&quot;.

Gonarezhou National Park forms part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a peace park that links Gonarezhou with the Kruger National Park in South Africa and the Limpopo National Park in Mozambique. Animals can move freely between the three sanctuaries. The northeastern end of Gonarezhou is located within the Zambezian and mopane woodlands, while the southwestern end is located within the Southern Africa bushveld ecoregion.

==History==

The Gonarezhou National Park was first established as a protected area in 1936 as a Game Reserve, eventually being proclaimed a National Park in 1975. The park has had a turbulent history and was closed to the public during the Rhodesian War and again during much of the Mozambique civil war but was re-opened in 1994. Between 1994 and 2007, the Gonarezhou National Park was wholly managed by the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, however the economic challenges in Zimbabwe up to 2007 meant that there was little reinvestment in infrastructure and protection of the Park. In 2007, the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority entered into a financial and technical assistance model for the Gonarezhou National Park with the Frankfurt Zoological Society. This model lasted up until 2017 and focused on investing in infrastructure and the protection of the Park&#x27;s resources. In March 2017, management of the Gonarezhou was handed over to the Gonarezhou Conservation Trust, a co-management partnership between the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority and the Frankfurt Zoological Society. This co-management model, overseen by a board of trustees represented equally by both partners, was created to establish a platform to enhance investment into the long-term sustainability of the Park - a key feature of which being the retention of tourism funds at a Park level for direct reinvestment into the Gonarezhou.

==Features==
The Gonarezhou National Park is one of the iconic wilderness areas of Africa, with relatively few tourists but boasting an amazing diversity of landscapes, features, and growing wildlife populations. By far, the most well known and prominent feature of the Park is the Chilojo Cliffs, sandstone cliffs towering 180 meters high and running for some 20 kilometers along the south bank of the Runde River. Other key features in the north of the Park are the two large natural pans, Tembwahata and Machanu, formed at the junction of the Save River and Runde River. In the central and southern areas of the Park are the Naymtongwe Plateau, a remnant of the Chilojo Cliffs, the Ntambambomvu Red Hills, densely wooded hill slopes standing above the Malvernia sand beds and the Mwenezi River Valley, and the Samalema Gorge, where the Mwenezi River carves through solid igneous rock-forming a braided river gorge.

===Fauna===
Historically the park has been a habitat for the endangered Cape wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;); and in 2010 there were several sightings of wild dogs in the park. It is thought that the cross-border link to national parks in Mozambique would be the best opportunity to restore or preserve the viability of this species in adjacent national parks in South Africa and Mozambique. Other mammals that inhabit the park are elephant, giraffe, hippopotamus, Cape buffalo, zebra, wildebeest, black and white rhinoceros, lion, leopard, cheetah, and hyena.

==Accommodation and camping==

<text>A hoedown is a type of American folk dance or square dance in duple meter, and also the musical form associated with it.

==Overview==
The most popular sense of the term is associated with Americans in rural or southeastern parts of the country, particularly Appalachia. It is a dance in quick movement most likely related to the jig, reel or clog dance. In contest fiddling, a hoedown is a tune in fast 2/4 time. In many contests, fiddlers are required to play a waltz, a hoedown, and a &quot;tune of choice,&quot; which must not be a waltz or a hoedown (typically it is a jig or a schottische).

In modern western square dance, a hoedown is a piece of music used for a patter call (a call that is spoken or chanted, rather than sung to the tune of a popular song), or the recording that contains this piece of music. In the early days of the Western square dance revival (the 1940s and early 1950s), most hoedowns were traditional fiddle tunes; since the late 1950s, recordings of simple chord progressions, with no discernible melody, have also been sold to callers under the name &quot;hoedown.&quot; In the 1940s and early 1950s, the term &quot;hoedown&quot; was sometimes used to mean a call made up of parts of other calls. &quot;Hoedown&quot; was, and occasionally still is, also used to mean a dance party jointly sponsored by several dance clubs or by a federation of clubs.

==References in modern culture==
The most famous hoedown in classical music is the section entitled &quot;Hoe-Down&quot; from the &quot;Rodeo&quot; ballet by Aaron Copland (1942). The most frequently heard version is from the &quot;Four Dance Episodes from Rodeo&quot;, which Copland extracted from the ballet shortly after its premiere; the dance episodes were first performed in 1943 by the Boston Pops conducted by Arthur Fiedler. Copland&#x27;s &quot;Hoe-Down&quot; became even more famous through television advertisements by America&#x27;s Beef Producers with the slogan &quot;Beef. It&#x27;s What&#x27;s For Dinner&quot;. 

&quot;Hoe-Down&quot; has been covered by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer on their album &quot;Trilogy&quot;, by Béla Fleck and the Flecktones on their albums &quot;Outbound&quot; and &quot;Live at the Quick&quot;, and by Jordan Rudess on his album &quot;Prime Cuts&quot;. Additionally, the jazz musician Oliver Nelson performed a jazz-infused variation written by himself entitled &quot;Hoe-Down&quot; on his album &quot;The Blues and the Abstract Truth&quot;.

The Beatles’ song &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; mentions a &quot;hoe-down&quot;.

Many episodes of the improvisational comedy show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; featured an impromptu hoedown singing competition.

In spring of 2024, pop singer Beyoncé released the song “Texas Hold ‘Em” which references a hoedown in its chorus.

<text>John Andrew Young (November 10, 1916 – January 22, 2002) was a Democratic politician from Texas who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1957 to 1979.

Born in Corpus Christi, Texas, Young attended Incarnate Word Academy and Corpus Christi College-Academy. He earned his B.A. at St. Edward&#x27;s University in 1937 and his L.L.B from the University of Texas School of Law in 1940. After starting his career as a lawyer, he served in the United States Navy from 1941 to 1945.

Young served as a lawyer for Nueces County, Texas in various positions, as assistant county attorney in 1946, assistant district attorney from 1947 to 1950, county attorney from 1951 to 1952 and county judge from 1953 to 1956. He ran successfully as a Democrat for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1956, defeating incumbent John J. Bell in the primary election and winning the general election. He took seat in 1957 and was reelected ten times. Young voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, but voted in favor the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

Young came under fire in 1976 when a former female member of his staff, Colleen Gardner, accused him of requiring her to have sex with him in order to keep her job. Young, who was married with five children at the time, denied the accusation and an investigation produced no evidence. His wife, Jane, committed suicide on July 13, 1977, by a gunshot to the head.

The scandal caused his defeat to Joseph P. Wyatt, Jr. in the primary election in 1978 and he left office in 1979.
Afterwards, he worked as a consultant until his death on January 22, 2002. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

<doc id="986463" wikidata="Q1571380" url="?curid=986463" title="Hwange National Park">
<text>Hwange National Park (formerly Wankie Game Reserve) is the largest natural reserve in Zimbabwe. It is around 14,600 sq km in area. It lies in the northwest of the country, just off the main road between Bulawayo and Victoria Falls. The nearest town is Dete. Histories of the region&#x27;s pre-colonial days and its development as a game reserve and National Park are available online 

==History ==
Hwange National Park was founded in 1928.
It is considered for inclusion in the five-nation Kavango - Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area.

===Poaching incidents===
In 2011, nine elephants, five lions and two buffaloes were killed by poachers.

In October 2013 it was discovered that poachers killed a large number of African elephants with cyanide after poisoning their waterhole. Conservationists have claimed the incident to be the largest illegal killing of animals in Southern Africa in 25 years. Two aerial surveys were carried to determine the extent of the deaths, and 19 carcasses were identified in the first survey and a further 84 carcasses in the second survey. Three of the poachers were caught, arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced. All royal game and elephant poaching offences now have a mandatory 9-year sentence and the supply chain is also targeted.

===Cecil and Xanda hunting incidents===
On or about 1 July 2015, Cecil, a lion who had lived on Hwange National Park for 13 years, was killed. This action spurred widespread social media coverage and a petition calling for Zimbabwe&#x27;s president Robert Mugabe to outlaw big game hunting permits. Walter Palmer, the admitted killer of Cecil, had a permit and was not charged with any crime, as all his papers were in order. Authorities in Zimbabwe have said he is free to visit the country. Charges were initially laid against Theo Bronkhorst, Palmer&#x27;s guide, for &quot;failing to stop an illegal hunt&quot; but these were later thrown out of court.

Two years after Cecil&#x27;s killing, his son Xanda met a similar fate. Unlike that of his father, Xanda&#x27;s killing was not termed illegal, though it did provoke outrage.

==Biodiversity==
===Flora===

The park is close to the edge of the Kalahari desert, a region with little water and very sparse, xerophile vegetation. The Kalahari woodland is dominated by Zambezi Teak, Sand Camwood (Baphia) and Kalahari bauhinia. Seasonal wetlands form grasslands in this area.

The north and north-west of the park are dominated by mopane woodland.

Although it has been argued that elephant populations cause change in vegetation structure, some recent studies suggest that this is not the case, even with the large increases in elephant population recorded in the late 1980s.

===Fauna===

The Park hosts over 100 mammal and 400 bird species, including 19 large herbivores and eight large carnivores. All Zimbabwe&#x27;s specially protected animals are to be found in Hwange and it is the only protected area where gemsbok and brown hyena occur in small numbers.

Grazing herbivores are more common in the Main Camp Wild Area and Linkwasha Concession Area, with mixed feeders more common in the Robins and Sinamatella Wild Areas, which are more heavily wooded. Distribution fluctuates seasonally, with large herbivores concentrating in areas where intensive water pumping is maintained during the dry season.

The population of the Cape wild dogs to be found in Hwange is thought to be of one of the larger surviving groups in Africa today, along with that of Kruger National Park and Selous Game Reserve.

Other major predators include the lion, whose distribution and hunting in Hwange is strongly related to the pans and waterholes.
Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit together with the Okavango Delta.

African leopard, spotted hyena and cheetah are also present in the protected area.
Elephants have been enormously successful in Hwange and the population has increased to far above that naturally supported by such an area. This population of elephants has put a lot of strain on the resources of the park. There has been a lot of debate on how to deal with this, with parks authorities implementing culling to reduce populations, especially during 1967 to 1986. The elephant population doubled in the five years following the end of culling in 1986.

National Parks Scientific Services co-ordinates two major conservation and research projects in the park:
*National Leopard Project, which is surveying numbers of leopard to obtain base-line data for later comparative analysis with status of leopard in consumptive (hunting) areas and Communal Land bordering the National Park. This is carried out at Hwange in conjunction with the Wildlife Conservation and Research Unit of Oxford University and the Dete Animal Rescue Trust, a registered wildlife conservation Trust
*Painted Dog Project: The project aims to protect and increase the range and numbers of African wild dog both in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in Africa, and operates through the Painted Dog Conservation organisation in Dete.

===Geography and geology===
Most of the park is underlain by Kalahari Sands. In the north-west there are basalt lava flows of the Batoka Formation, stretching from south of Bumbusi to the Botswana border. In the north-central area, from Sinamatella going eastwards, there are granites and gneisses of the Kamativi-Dete Inlier and smaller inliers of these rocks are found within the basalts in the north-west.

The north and north-west of the park are drained by the Deka and Lukosi rivers and their tributaries, and the far south of the park is drained by the Gwabadzabuya River, a tributary of the Nata River. There are no rivers in the rest of the park, although there are fossil drainage channels in the main camp and Linkwasha areas, which form seasonal wetlands. In these areas without rivers, grassy pan depressions and pans have formed. Some of these pans, such as many of the pans in the Shumba area, fill with rainwater, while others, such as Ngweshla, Shakwanki and Nehimba, are fed by natural groundwater seeps. Many of the pans are additionally supplied by water pumped from underground by park authorities.

===Archaeological, historical and cultural sites===
People have lived in the region for tens of thousands of years, as attested by numerous archaeological sites ranging from early Stone Age to the historic era. Stone age foragers hunted and gathered in the region, leaving numerous sites with stone tools throughout today&#x27;s park. They made engravings of animal hoofprints on sandstone rockshelter walls with some small rock paintings in the park&#x27;s northwest. Iron-age people built large and small stone-walling sites in the park, such Mtoa and the Bumbusi National Monument. Information about the people who once lived in today&#x27;s park is available online.

<doc id="986465" wikidata="Q3128789" url="?curid=986465" title="Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis">
<text>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the development of a bacterial infection in the peritoneum, despite the absence of an obvious source for the infection. It is specifically an infection of the ascitic fluid – an increased volume of peritoneal fluid. Ascites is most commonly a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. It can also occur in patients with nephrotic syndrome. SBP has a high mortality rate.

The diagnosis of SBP requires paracentesis, a sampling of the peritoneal fluid taken from the peritoneal cavity. If the fluid contains large numbers of white blood cells known as neutrophils (&gt;250 cells/μL), infection is confirmed and antibiotics will be given, without waiting for culture results. In addition to antibiotics, infusions of albumin are usually administered.

Other life-threatening complications such as kidney malfunction and increased liver insufficiency can be triggered by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 30% of SBP patients develop kidney malfunction, one of the strongest predictors for mortality. Where there are signs of this development albumin infusion will also be given.

Spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) can also occur and this can sometimes accompany a bacterial infection.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) include fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, general malaise, altered mental status, and worsening ascites. Thirteen percent of patients have no signs or symptoms. In cases of acute or chronic liver failure SBP is one of the main triggers for hepatic encephalopathy, and where there is no other clear causal indication for this, SBP may be suspected.

These symptoms can also be the same for a spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) and therefore make a differentiation difficult. Delay of diagnosis can delay antifungal treatment and lead to a higher mortality rate.

==Causes==
SBP is most commonly caused by Gram-negative &quot;E. coli&quot;, followed by &quot;Klebsiella&quot;. Common Gram-positive bacteria identified include species of &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, and &quot;Enterococcus&quot;. The percentage of gram-positive bacteria responsible has been increasing.

A spontaneous fungal infection can often follow a spontaneous bacterial infection that has been treated with antibiotics. The use of antibiotics can result in an excessive growth of fungi in the gut flora which can then into the peritoneal cavity. Although fungi are much larger than bacteria, the increased intestinal permeability resulting from advanced cirrhosis makes their translocation easier. SFP is mostly caused by species of &quot;Candida&quot; and most commonly by &quot;Candida albicans&quot;.

== Pathophysiology ==

H2 antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors are medications that decrease or suppress the secretion of acid by the stomach. Their use in treating cirrhosis is associated with the development of SBP. Bacterial translocation is thought to be the key mechanism for the development of SBP. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth which may be implicated in this translocation, is found in a large percentage of those with cirrhosis.
With respect to compromised host defenses, patients with severe acute or chronic liver disease are often deficient in complement and may also have malfunctioning of the neutrophilic and reticuloendothelial systems.

As for the significance of ascitic fluid proteins, it was demonstrated that cirrhotic patients with ascitic protein concentrations below 1 g/dL were 10 times more likely to develop SBP than individuals with higher concentrations. It is thought that the antibacterial, or opsonic, activity of ascitic fluid is closely correlated with the protein concentration. Additional studies have confirmed the validity of the ascitic fluid protein concentration as the best predictor of the first episode of SBP.

In nephrotic syndrome, SBP can frequently affect children but only very rarely can it affect adults.

==Diagnosis==
Infection of the peritoneum causes an inflammatory reaction with a subsequent increase in the number of neutrophils in the fluid. Diagnosis is made by paracentesis (needle aspiration of the ascitic fluid); SBP is diagnosed if the fluid contains neutrophils at greater than 250 cells per mm3 (equals a cell count of 250 x106/L) fluid in the absence of another reason for this (such as inflammation of one of the internal organs or a perforation).

The fluid is also cultured to identify bacteria. If the sample is sent in a plain sterile container, 40% of samples will identify an organism, while if the sample is sent in a bottle with culture medium, the sensitivity increases to 72–90%.

==Prevention==
All people with cirrhosis might benefit from antibiotics (oral fluoroquinolone norfloxacin) if:
* Ascitic fluid protein &lt;1.0 g/dL. Patients with fluid protein &lt;15 g/L and either Child–Pugh score of at least 9 or impaired renal function may also benefit.
* Previous SBP

People with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital should receive prophylactic antibiotics if:
* They have bleeding esophageal varices

Studies on the use of rifaximin in cirrhotic patients, have suggested that its use may be effective in preventing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

==Treatment==

===Antibiotics===
Although there is no high-quality evidence, the third-generation cephalosporins are considered the standard empirical treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with cirrhosis.

Other resources mentioned that empiric third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for suspected SBP with a Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) count over 250 cells/µL. The exception was that if in cases of prior beta-lactam use or hospital-acquired infections, the treatment should be guided by susceptibility testing. Patients with a PMN count above 500 cells/µL require hospitalization and antibiotics, with follow-up ascitic fluid analysis. Lack of improvement within 48 hours may indicate secondary bacterial peritonitis, potentially requiring surgery. A PMN reduction of at least 25% suggests an adequate response to treatment.

In practice, cefotaxime is the agent of choice for treatment of SBP. After confirmation of SBP, hospital admission is usually advised for observation and intravenous antibiotic therapy.

Where there is a risk of kidney malfunction developing in a syndrome called hepatorenal syndrome, intravenous albumin is usually administered too. Paracentesis may be repeated after 48 hours to ensure control of infection. After recovery from a single episode of SBP, indefinite prophylactic antibiotics are recommended.

===Prokinetics===
The addition of a prokinetic drug to an antibiotic regimen reduces the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis possibly via decreasing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

===Intravenous albumin===
A randomized controlled trial found that intravenous albumin on the day of admission and on hospital day 3 can reduce kidney impairment.

== Prognosis ==
With proper treatment, infection-related mortality in SBP is low, but outcomes worsen if sepsis develops. In hospitals, non-infection-related mortality can reach 20–40%, while one- and two-year mortality rates are approximately 70% and 80%, respectively.

== Complications ==
There are complications associated with SBP such as:

* Renal failure 
* Sepsis
* Liver failure/insufficiency
* Tense ascites
* Bleeding after paracentesis 
* Bowel perforation after paracentesis 
* Spontaneous fungal peritonitis.

== Epidemiology ==
Patients with ascites underwent routine paracentesis; the incidence of active SBP ranged from 10% to 27% at the time of hospital admission.

==History==
SBP was first described in 1964 by Harold O. Conn.

<text>The Bimini Road, sometimes called the Bimini Wall, is an underwater rock formation near the island of North Bimini in the Bimini chain of islands. The Road consists of a -long northeast-southwest linear feature composed of roughly rectangular limestone blocks. Various claims have been made for this feature being either a wall, road, pier, breakwater, or other man-made structure. However, credible evidence or arguments are lacking for such an origin.

== Physical characteristics ==
On September 2, 1968, while diving in 5.5 meters (18 feet) of water off the northwest coast of North Bimini, Joseph Manson Valentine, Jacques Mayol and Robert Angove encountered what they called a &quot;pavement&quot; of what later was found to be noticeably rounded stones of varying size and thickness. These stones form a northeast-southwest linear feature, which is now commonly known as either the &quot;Bimini Road&quot; or &quot;Bimini Wall&quot;. Two similar linear features lie parallel to and shoreward of the Bimini Wall.

The Bimini Wall and two linear features lying shoreward of it are composed of flat-lying, tabular, and roughly rectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks. Descriptions of the Bimini Road found in various books and articles greatly exaggerate the regularity and rectangularity of the blocks composing these features. The Bimini Road, the largest of three linear features, is long, a northeast/southwest-trending feature with a pronounced hook at its southwest end. It consists of stone blocks measuring as much as in horizontal dimensions, with the average size being . The larger blocks show complementary edges, which are lacking in the smaller blocks. The two narrower and shorter, approximately -long linear features lying shoreward of the Bimini Road consist of smaller tabular stone blocks that are only in maximum horizontal breadth. Having rounded corners, the blocks composing these pavements resemble giant loaves of bread. The blocks consist of limestone composed of carbonate-cemented shell hash that is called &quot;beachrock&quot;. Beachrock is native to the Bahamas. The highly rounded nature of the blocks forming the Bimini Road indicates that a significant thickness of their original surface has been removed by biological, physical, and chemical processes. Given the degree to which these blocks have been eroded, it is highly implausible that any original surface features, including any tool marks and inscriptions, would have survived this degree of erosion.

After a very detailed examination of the Bimini Road and the other linear features, Gifford and Ball made the following observations:

As noted below, these observations are disputed by other investigators. For example, some investigators claim that where sand had washed away between the seams, another course of blocks can be seen along with small blocks underlying these blocks. However, detailed evidence that clearly documents the alleged presence of a continuous second layer (course) of stones beneath the stones forming the currently exposed &quot;pavement&quot; has not been published in a reputable, scientific venue with the detail that is needed for critical evaluation. Pictures posted on various Web pages of stones alleged to be artificial &quot;wedge stones&quot; and &quot;prop stones&quot; fail as convincing evidence for a second course of stones because they are typically smaller in size, do not form a continuous course, and too infrequently lie directly beneath the blocks that form the surface of the Bimini Road. This is not what would be expected of an actual underlying course of man-made masonry.

David Zink states:

This led him to conclude:

In addition, early studies of the Bimini Road, i.e. Gifford and Ball and David Zink, report taking numerous samples and cores for examination. It is also safe to presume that a certain number of the innumerable visitors to the Bimini Road have chipped off pieces of it. Scientific sampling and souvenir hunting would have left behind modern &quot;tool marks&quot; on the various blocks composing the Bimini Road for later investigators to find.

== Age ==
Attempts have been made to determine the age of this feature using different techniques. These include direct radiocarbon dating of the stones composing the Bimini Road and uranium-thorium dating of the marine limestone on which the Bimini Road lies.

In 1978, the radiocarbon laboratory operated by the Department of Geology at the University of Miami dated samples from a core collected by E. A. Shinn in 1977 from the Bimini Road. In 1979, Calvert and others reported dates of 2780±70 yr BP (UM-1359), 3500±80 yr BP (UM-1360), and 3350±90 yr BP (UM-1361) from whole-rock samples; a date of 3510±70 yr BP (UM-1362), from shells extracted from the beachrock core; and dates of 2770±80 yr BP (UM-1364) and 2840±70 yr BP (UM-1365) from carbonate cementing the beachrock core. These dates are temporally consistent in that the shells composing the beachrock core from the Bimini Road dated older than the cement holding them together as beachrock. These dates can be interpreted as indicating that the shells composing the Bimini Road are, uncorrected for temporal and environmental variations in radiocarbon, about 3,500 years old. Because of time-averaging and other taphonomic factors, a random collection of shells likely would yield a radiocarbon date that is a few hundred years earlier than when the final accumulation of shells, which were cemented to form beachrock, actually occurred. The radiocarbon dates from the cement demonstrate that the beachrock composing the Bimini Road formed about 2,800 radiocarbon years ago by the cementation of pre-existing sediments that accumulated about 1,300 years earlier. Compared to the dates from the shells and the cement, it appears that the whole-rock dates reflect samples containing varying proportions of shell and cement without any significant contamination by younger radiocarbon. Both these dates and interpretation are consistent with the detailed research by Davaud and Strasser that concluded that the layer of beachrock composing the Bimini Road formed beneath the surface of the island and was exposed by coastal erosion only about 1,900 to 2,000 years ago.

Proponents of the Bimini Road being a manmade feature argue that these radiocarbon dates are invalid because they were obtained entirely from whole-rock samples and subject to contamination from younger carbon. The background data reported by Calvert and others concerning the radiocarbon dates from the Bimini Road demonstrate that not all of these dates come entirely from whole-rock samples. That the dates from the shells and the clearly younger cement holding them together as beachrock are temporally consistent argues against any significant alteration of their radiocarbon content. In addition, other studies using radiocarbon dating to study sea level and the age of sediment and beachrock within the Bahamas have not reported any significant problems with contamination by younger radiocarbon. In their detailed research, Davaud and Strasser accepted the radiocarbon dates obtained from the beachrock composing the Bimini Road from the radiocarbon laboratory at the University of Miami as valid indicators of its age.

Gifford and Ball attempted to establish a minimum age using uranium-thorium dating for the Bimini Road by dating a whole-rock sample of the marine limestone (biopelsparite) that underlies the beachrock that composes the Bimini Road. They described this sample as being &quot;Whole rock marine limestone under beachrock off Paradise Point, North Bimini; some recrystallisation.&quot; This sample yielded a uranium-thorium date of 14,992±258 BP (7132-19/2). Supporters of the idea that the Bimini Road is a man-made structure frequently cite this date in support of its being artificial.

The uranium-thorium date published by Gifford and Ball is regarded as an invalid and meaningless date for two reasons. First, the sample being partially recrystallised means that this limestone was not a closed system as required for a meaningful uranium-thorium date. As a result, this specific date is only an apparent date that completely lacks any scientific value for interpreting the age of marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road. Currently, specific species of corals and mollusks that can be demonstrated to lack any recrystallisation using petrographic and X-ray diffraction techniques are the preferred samples for dating. Any limestone sample that shows the least amount of recrystallisation is now regarded as incapable of yielding a scientifically valid date and not even worth an attempt at dating. Finally, it is well documented that about 15,000 calendar years ago, sea level in this region was between below present sea level. As a result, the location from where Gifford and Ball collected the sample of limestone was between above sea level at the time indicated by the uranium-thorium date of 14,992±258 BP (7132-19/2). Therefore, it is physically impossible for the marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road to have accumulated around 15,000 BP. Thus, this uranium-thorium date is a meaningless, invalid date lacking any scientific significance. Because this date lacks any scientific meaning, geologists and archaeologists rarely mention it in their discussions of the Bimini Road. The marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road dates to the Sangamonian Stage, the last interglacial, when sea level was last high enough for the marine sediments, now lithified into limestone, to have accumulated.

== Geological formation ==
The consensus among geologists and archaeologists is that the Bimini Road is a natural feature composed of beachrock that orthogonal and other joints have broken up into roughly rectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks. The geologists and anthropologists who have personally studied the Bimini Road include Eugene Shinn of the U.S. Geological Survey; Marshall McKusick, an Associate Professor of Anthropology at University of Iowa; W. Harrison of Environmental Research Associates, Virginia Beach, Virginia; Mahlon M. Ball and J. A. Gifford of the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science at the University of Miami; and Eric Davaud and A. Strasser of the Department of Geology and Paleontology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. After either inspecting or studying the Bimini Road, they all concluded that it consists of naturally jointed beachrock. John A. Gifford, a professional geologist, spent a significant time studying the geology of the Bimini Islands for his University of Miami Master&#x27;s thesis about the geology of the Bimini Islands. Calvert and others identified the samples that they dated from the Bimini Wall as being natural beachrock.

Detailed studies by E. Davaud and A. Strasser of Holocene limestones currently exposed on North Bimini and Joulter Cays (Bahamas) reveal the sequence of events likely responsible for creating beachrock pavements like the Bimini Road. First, a complete beach sequence of shallow subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal carbonate sediments accumulated as the shoreline of North Bimini built seaward during part of the Holocene. Once the deposition of these sediments built the North Bimini&#x27;s shoreline seaward, freshwater cementation of the carbonate occurred at some depth, possibly even a metre or so below sea level, beneath the island&#x27;s surface. This cementation created a band consisting of a thick primary layer of semilithified sediments and thinner discontinuous lenses and layers of similar semilithified sediments beneath it. Later, when erosion of the island&#x27;s shoreline occurred, the band of semilithifed sediment was exposed within the intertidal zone and the semilithified sediments were cemented into beachrock. As the sediments underlying the eroding shoreline were eroded down to Pleistocene limestone, the beachrock broke into flat-lying, tabular, and roughly rectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks as observed for modern beaches within the Bahamas by E. Davaud and A. Strasser. Thinner layers of beachrock underlying the primary bed of beachrock were also broken up as the loose sediments enclosing them and the thicker primary bed were eroded. As the loose sediment was scoured out from under the blocks and other pieces of beachrock by so-called &quot;scour and settling processes&quot;, they dropped downward for several metres until they rested directly on the erosion-resistant Pleistocene limestone as an erosional lag. Eugene Shinn discusses a similar, but not identical, process by which the Bimini Road could have been created.

The downward movement of large, solid objects by scour and settling processes has been documented by Jesse E. McNinch, John T. Wells, and other researchers. They concluded that large, heavy objects could sink into the sea bottom by several metres without significant lateral movement as the result of scour and settling processes if an erosion-resistant layer of sediment were not encountered. In case of the beachrock blocks composing the Bimini Road and other pieces underlying it, the erosion-resistant layer that limited how far they were dropped downward by scour and settling processes is the Pleistocene limestone on which they now rest.

Finally, pieces of thinner layers or lenses of beachrock underlying the primary bed that was broken up and dropped downward to create the Bimini Road would be trapped beneath the blocks as they also were broken up and dropped by erosion. The trapping of these fragments of beachrock beneath the blocks composing the Bimini Road, as erosion removed loose sediments and dropped them onto the surface of the Pleistocene limestone, would have created the so-called &quot;prop&quot; and &quot;wedge&quot; rocks and blocks alleged to be a &quot;second course&quot; of &quot;masonry&quot;. Presuming that the blocks of beachrock forming the Bimini Road originally formed at some unknown depth below sea level and have been dropped by erosion by several metres, dating the age of the Bimini Road by its relation to past sea level would be a useless technique that would produce misleading results.

Natural pavements composed of stone blocks, which often are far more rectangular and consistent in size than the blocks composing the Bimini Road, created by orthogonal and other jointing within sedimentary rocks, including beachrock, are quite common and found throughout the world. They include a popular tourist attraction, the Tessellated pavement of Eaglehawk Neck, Tasmania; jointed bedrock that has been completely misidentified as a man-made &quot;Phoenician Fortress and Furnace&quot; in Oklahoma; a &quot;tiled pavement&quot; reported from Battlement Mesa in western Colorado; the tessellated pavement of the Bouddi Peninsula near Sydney, Australia; and Arches National Park in Utah. Natural beachrock pavements that are identical to the Bimini Road have been found eroding out of the east shore of Loggerhead Key of Dry Tortugas and submerged beneath of water at Pulley Ridge off the southwest coast of Florida.

== Claims of a human origin ==
Although it is generally considered to be a naturally occurring geological feature, as a result of the unusual arrangement and shape of the stones, some believe that the formation is the remains of an ancient road, wall, or some other deliberately constructed feature. For example, articles published in &quot;Argosy&quot; (an American pulp magazine) and either authored or coauthored by Robert F. Marx, a professional diver and visitor to the Bimini Road, argued that the Bimini Road is an artificial structure. In a 1971 &quot;Argosy&quot; article, Marx reported that Carl H. Holm, who was President (not &quot;head geologist&quot; as reported by Marx) of Global Oceanic, once a manager for North American Rockwell, a ship designer; and retired naval officer, stated that there was &quot;little doubt&quot; that the massive stone blocks were cut by people. The same article noted that he was part of an expedition sponsored by North American Rockwell that included Edgar Mitchell, the astronaut, as leader; Dimitri Rebikoff; and &quot;a number of psychics from the Edgar Cayce Foundation.&quot;

Others who consider the Bimini undersea formation to be man-made, as opposed to natural beachrock, are Joseph Manson Valentine, zoologist; Graham Hancock, pseudoscientific writer; Charles Berlitz, linguist; Greg Little, psychologist; R. Cedric Leonard, anthropologist; and Dimitri Rebikoff, French marine engineer. All claim to have investigated the formations in person, and claim to have observed more than one horizontal layer of blocks, at least in places. However, multiple layers of block can result naturally from systematic fracturing of sedimentary rock where multiple layers of sedimentary rock lie on top of each, as can be observed in the case of the tessellated pavement of Tasmania exposed at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula.

In his debunked pseudohistorical book &quot;1421: The Year China Discovered America&quot;, amateur historian Gavin Menzies falsely claimed that when Chinese admiral Zheng He&#x27;s fleet was in the process of circumnavigating the globe in 1421–3, it stopped at Bimini. According to Menzies, half of the fleet, under the command of admiral Zhou Wen, was caught in a hurricane near Bimini and built the Bimini Road from beach rock and the ships&#x27; ballast as a slipway to haul damaged junks ashore for refitting and repairs of damage caused by the hurricane. There is no evidence for these claims.

<doc id="986472" wikidata="Q2427653" url="?curid=986472" title="Georgia State Route 10 Loop (Athens)">
<text>State Route 10 Loop (SR 10 Loop, also known as Loop 10, Paul Broun, Sr. Parkway, or the Athens Perimeter) is a state highway in the form of a beltway around downtown Athens in the U.S. state of Georgia built to freeway standards. Much of SR 10 Loop is concurrent with other highways (including U.S. Route 29 (US 29), US 78, US 129, US 441, SR 8, and SR 15). It also carries the unsigned SR 422. The only numbered routes to travel through downtown Athens are US 78 Bus., SR 10, and SR 15 Alt. Inner/outer directions are used to sign the loop.

Between exits 4 and 8, there is an eight-route concurrency, consisting of US 29, US 78, US 129, US 441, SR 8, SR 10 Loop, SR 15, and the unsigned SR 422. This concurrency contains the most highways in a single United States concurrency, tied with a section of the I-465 beltway circling Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Route description==

SR 10 Loop begins at an interchange with US 29, US 78, SR 8 and SR 316 to the south, and Epps Bridge Parkway to the north in Oconee County south of Athens. It heads east as a four-lane freeway, concurrent with US 29, US 78, and SR 8, and crosses McNutt Creek to enter Clarke County and Athens as it meets a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 129, US 441 and SR 15, which includes a connection to Timothy Road to the north. Those three routes join SR 10 Loop as it continues east and crosses the Middle Oconee River. The freeway then curves to the northeast and intersects Milledge Avenue, where SR 15 Alternate begins, heading north from the interchange.

After this intersection, SR 10 Loop crosses a Georgia shortline railroad and turns to the northeast, where it meets College Station Road at a diamond interchange. At this point the highway right-of-way abuts the University of Georgia campus; immediately north of the College Station Road interchange is an on-ramp to a campus parking lot that is normally closed, but is used on home football game days to allow departing spectators access onto inner 10 Loop directly from campus. Northeast of here, the highway crosses the North Oconee River and meets a folded diamond interchange with SR 10, which is Oconee Street west of the interchange and Lexington Road east of it. At this interchange, US 78 splits from the highway and turns east, and its business route (US 78 Bus.) begins and heads west toward the center of the city.

North of this interchange, SR 10 Loop curves to the northwest and intersects with Peter Street and Olympic Drive at a partial cloverleaf interchange, then crosses Trail Creek and a CSX railroad, then meets an interchange with Old Hull Road. This interchange does not provide complete access between the two roads; there is only an exit going northbound and only an entrance from Old Hull Road going southbound. Just north of here, the highway meets an interchange at which US 29 and SR 8 continue north towards Hartwell and Greenville, South Carolina while SR 10 Loop, US 129, US 441, and SR 15 exit and turn due west. This interchange also completes access to Old Hull Road by providing the movements missing from the aforementioned interchange: an exit from the inner loop and an entrance to the outer loop.

West of this interchange, the freeway passes over the western fork of Trail Creek, then meets a partial cloverleaf interchange with North Avenue and Danielsville Road. Farther west, it intersects Dr Martin Luther King Jr Parkway and Commerce Road at a diamond interchange. Here, US 441 and SR 15 leave the freeway and turn north along Commerce Road. SR 10 Loop then curves in a southwesterly direction and crosses the North Oconee River again before coming to another diamond interchange, this one with Chase Street.

SR 10 Loop continues southwest and crosses the CSX railroad again, then dips to the north and intersects SR 15 Alternate, which is Prince Avenue south of the interchange and Jefferson Road north of it. At this interchange, US 129 leaves SR 10 Loop and joins SR 15 Alternate heading north towards Jefferson. The freeway&#x27;s next exit to the southwest is a diamond interchange with Tallassee Road and Oglethorpe Avenue. Farther southwest, SR 10 Loop crosses the Middle Oconee River again, then intersects SR 10 and US 78 Bus at a partial cloverleaf interchange with Atlanta Highway.

Then, SR 10 Loop curves back to the southeast, crosses McNutt&#x27;s Creek, leaving Athens and crossing back into Oconee County. The freeway has one final exit with the Oconee Connector, access to which is incomplete; the outer loop has only an exit, and the inner loop has only an entrance. Finally, the highway curves back to the east and meets the interchange with US 29, US 78, SR 8, and SR 316, where the exit numbers reset and the loop begins again.

The entire length of SR 10 Loop is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation&#x27;s economy, mobility, and defense.

==History==
===1960s===
The highway that would eventually become SR 10 Loop was established as SR 350 between June 1960 and June 1963. It extended from US 129/SR 15 in the northwestern part of the city to US 29/SR 8 in the northeastern part. The entire divided highway was paved. By the end of 1965, US 29 was designated on SR 350 from the US 129/SR 15 interchange, which also had US 29 Temp. and US 441 Temp., to the US 29/SR 8 interchange. US 441 Temp. was designated on it from the US 129/SR 15 interchange to the US 441/SR 15 Alt. interchange. A western extension of SR 350, ending at US 29/US 78/SR 8/SR 10, was under construction. Also, SR 350 was under construction east-southeast just slightly from the US 29/SR 8 interchange. In 1966, SR 350 was decommissioned. US 29 was designated on the freeway from the western terminus to where it, as well as SR 8, depart the freeway. This interchange also had SR 8 Bus. and SR 106. SR 8 was designated on the entire length of the freeway. Its former path through the city was redesignated as SR 8 Bus., still concurrent with US 78/SR 10. In 1967, US 29 was extended on the freeway one interchange to the east. At this interchange, SR 72 was extended southeast to end here, concurrent with US 29/SR 8.

===1970s and 1980s===
In 1976, SR 72 was indicated to be &quot;projected mileage&quot; from this point south to US 78/SR 10, then southwest and west to end at US 441/SR 15. In 1980, the freeway was completed along this path, with US 129/US 441/SR 15 designated on it. The next year, the portion of the freeway between US 29/SR 8/SR 72 and US 78/SR 10 on the northeastern part was downgraded to a divided highway. In 1983, the final piece of the freeway on the southwestern part was indicated to be designated as SR 732 as projected mileage. US 129/US 441/SR 15 Alt. was designated on the freeway from the southern end to their current respective interchanges. In 1985, US 441 Temp. was no longer shown on maps. SR 72&#x27;s western terminus was truncated to the far northeastern part of the city, at its current location. In 1987, the freeway was completed in the southwestern part of the city. SR 10 was designated on it from the original western terminus to the eastern US 78/SR 10 Bus. interchange. Its old path through downtown, still concurrent with US 78, was redesignated as SR 10 Bus. At this time, SR 72 was re-extended to the northeastern interchange. The next year, SR 10 was shifted back to downtown, with SR 10 Loop designated on the freeway. US 78 was shifted to the southern side of the freeway, with its former path redesignated as US 78 Bus.

===1990s and 2000s===
In 1991, SR 15 and SR 15 Alt. in the area were swapped to their current paths. In 1995, US 29/SR 8 was also shifted to the southern side of the freeway, concurrent with US 78/SR 316. SR 72&#x27;s western terminus was once again truncated to its current location. In 2001, US 129/US 441/SR 15 was placed on a southern concurrency with the freeway for less than . This brief concurrency ended at Macon Highway. The next year, US 129/US 441/SR 15 was shifted off of Macon Highway and onto the freeway. In 2004, the unsigned SR 422 designation was applied to the freeway.

New exit numbers were assigned on August 2, 2004.
===2010s===
In 2011, the half-diamond interchange at Oconee Parkway was added, with access limited from the parkway to the inner loop, and from the outer loop to the parkway. In 2015, the entirety of Loop 10 was made a freeway with the upgrade of the at-grade junction at Peter Street and Olympic Drive to a partial cloverleaf interchange.

==Future==
The folded diamond interchange at SR 10 (Lexington Road/Oconee Street; Exit 8) is planned to be upgraded in 2025. A new ramp will be built from SR 10 and Barnett Shoals Road to access the outer loop alongside a project that will widen SR 10. It is undecided whether the existing loop ramp from SR 10 to the outer loop should be removed or not.

The interchange with SR 8/US 29 at the northeastern most point on the loop is planned to upgrade the two bridges over SR 10 Loop heading east and west-bound, with two lanes over each bridge. Construction is planned to start in 2021. The two bridges were completed in 2024 and are now operational.

<doc id="986486" wikidata="Q7287898" url="?curid=986486" title="Ralph Nader 2004 presidential campaign">
<text>The 2004 presidential campaign of [[Ralph Nader]], political activist, author, lecturer and attorney began on February 23, 2004. This was Nader&#x27;s third presidential campaign, having run in 1996 and 2000 campaign as the candidate for the Green Party; in 2004 he ran as an independent candidate. Nader won the 2002 endorsement of the Reform Party USA, and thus appeared on the ballot as the Reform Party candidate in several states. In some states, Nader was on the ballot as an independent candidate, while in other states, Nader was deemed not to have met the requirements for ballot access.

==Background==
In April 2003, &quot;Salon&quot; reported that Ralph Nader was weighing whether to run for president in 2004, and that he was leaning towards doing so; he also met with several Green Party officials to discuss the possibility. In December 2003, he announced that he would not seek the Green Party&#x27;s presidential nomination the following year.

==Announcement==
Nader announced his intention to run for president during a February 22, 2004, appearance on the NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. He stated, in part, that &quot;After careful thought and my desire to retire our supremely elected president, I&#x27;ve decided to run as an independent candidate for president.&quot; During the appearance, he also expressed his support for impeaching George W. Bush, deemed the Democratic Party a &quot;captive of corporate interests&quot;, criticized the &quot;two-party duopoly&quot;, and called Washington, DC, &quot;corporate occupied territory&quot;. During his appearance on the show, there were more than one dozen protestors outside the NBC studio, objecting to his decision to run, in addition to another dozen supporting his candidacy.

Later that morning, Democratic National Committee chair Terry McAuliffe appeared on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and was asked for his reaction to Nader&#x27;s announcement; McAuliffe deemed it &quot;very unfortunate&quot; but also predicted that Nader&#x27;s disassociation from the Green Party would hinder him and that the national Green Party would recognize that &quot;the stakes are so big this time&quot; compared to 2000. New Mexico governor Bill Richardson claimed that Nader&#x27;s campaign was &quot;about him. It&#x27;s about his ego. It&#x27;s about his vanity and not about a movement.&quot; Candidates running in the Democratic primary were generally dismissive of Nader&#x27;s announcement as well, with John Kerry announcing that he planned to &quot;appeal to everybody in this race, and we&#x27;ll make it unnecessary in the end for an alternative&quot; and John Edwards responding that his goal was to unite voters across the ideological spectrum and that Nader &quot;will not impact my campaign.&quot;

==Campaign==
===Party lines===
====Populist Party====
In states where ballot access is more readily available by forming a new political party than by filing as an independent candidate, the Ralph Nader campaign chose to create the Populist Party. Nader appeared on the 2004 general election ballot under the designation &quot;A Better Life&quot; in the State of Minnesota and &quot;The Better Life&quot; in the State of Louisiana.

This Populist Party had no connection either to the much earlier American political party of that name or to the late-twentieth century Populist Party, which ran candidates such as David Duke and Bo Gritz and was widely regarded as a racist, white supremacist organization.

The Nader campaign expected that the new Populist Party organization would exist only for the limited purpose of achieving ballot access for Ralph Nader in 2004. However, an effort was made by the Populist Party of Maryland to field candidates for governor, other statewide seats, and at the local level for the State Assembly, county, and municipal positions in the 2005 and 2006 elections.

====Other parties====
In Delaware, Nader accepted the endorsement of the Independent Party of Delaware on August 15. In New York Nader was nominated by the Independence Party at their party convention, and also appeared on the ballot under the Peace and Justice Party ballot lines.

=== Ballot access ===
As of October 26, 2004, Nader was slated to appear on the ballot in 34 states and Washington, D.C., and was off the ballot in eight states: California, Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia.

The Nader campaign failed to gain a spot on a number of state ballots, and faced legal challenges to its efforts in a number of states. In some cases, state officials found large numbers of submitted voter petitions invalid. While Nader campaign officials blamed legal challenges by the Democratic Party for their difficulties in getting Nader&#x27;s name on the ballot, the difficulties faced by petition-gatherers were also a significant factor – there were far fewer people in 2004 eager to sign petitions for Ralph Nader, and petition-gatherers complained that they often received verbal abuse from people they solicited. One of Nader&#x27;s California organizers observed that &quot;paid signature gatherers did not work for more than a week or two. They all quit. They said it was too abusive.&quot;

On April 5, 2004, Nader failed in an attempt to get on the Oregon ballot. &quot;Unwritten rules&quot; disqualified over 700 valid voter signatures, all of which had already been verified by county elections officers, who themselves signed and dated every sheet with an affidavit of authenticity (often with a county seal as well). This subtraction left Nader 218 short of the 15,306 needed. He vowed to gather the necessary signatures in a petition drive. Secretary of State Bill Bradbury disqualified many of his signatures as fraudulent; the Marion County Circuit Court ruled that this action was unconstitutional as the criteria for Bradbury&#x27;s disqualifications were based upon &quot;unwritten rules&quot; not found in electoral code, but the state Supreme Court ultimately reversed this ruling. Nader appealed this decision to the US Supreme Court, but a decision did not arrive before the 2004 election. 
In a majority of states where Nader&#x27;s name was not printed on the ballot, write-in votes for the Nader/Camejo ticket were still permitted and counted.

In Alabama and New York, a ballot line appeared in which running mate Peter Camejo was replaced with Jan D. Pierce, a Vice President of the Communications Workers of America and in 2000 was head of &quot;Labor for Nader.&quot; Pierce had also been filed as his running mate in Ohio, where they failed to get on the ballot. In Montana Camejo was replaced with Karen Sanchirico, an Ada County, Idaho Green Party activist and founder of the Idaho Patriots.

===Meeting with Congressional Black Caucus===
Nader attended a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. The session soon turned into a shouting exchange and several CBC members stormed out. Nader argued that he would draw enough independents and Republicans away to weaken President George W. Bush. The caucus urged Nader to give up his presidential run, fearing that vote splitting would hurt John Kerry, the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) called the upcoming election &quot;a life or death matter&quot; for the Caucus members&#x27; constituents. Nader accused Congressman Mel Watt of twice uttering an &quot;obscene racial epithet&quot; towards him. Nader wrote the caucus chairman, Elijah Cummings, demanding an apology, but none was given.

==Criticism==
A number of liberal political figures, including some who had supported Nader&#x27;s 2000 campaign, asked him not to run in 2004. A Democrat started a website called RalphDontRun.net to ask Nader not to run, and then to ask Nader&#x27;s supporters to instead support Democratic nominee John Kerry. Former president Jimmy Carter was also critical of Nader&#x27;s 2004 candidacy; at a March 2004 Democratic fundraiser, Carter said &quot;Ralph, go back to umpiring softball games or examining the rear end of automobiles, and don&#x27;t risk costing the Democrats the White House this year as you did four years ago&quot;. An April 2004 article in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, which had endorsed Nader in 2000, also criticized Nader for his campaign, and for his past decisions to spend time campaigning in swing states instead of &quot;safe states&quot;.

Nader countered these criticisms by arguing that they were evidence that his detractors couldn’t fault him on policy-related grounds, and pointed to the estimated 45 million Americans who at the time lacked health insurance.

==Results==

Nader received 465,642 votes, for 0.38% of the total vote while finishing 3rd place once again, though with far fewer votes compared to four years prior.

==Endorsements==
* Reform Party USA
* Independent Party of Delaware
* Independence Party of New York

<text>The Swedish Assembly of Finland (, , although often referred to as &quot;Folktinget&quot; even in Finnish) is an official consultative parliament representing the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. 

Folktinget was originally founded in 1919 but dissolved the following year. It was re-established in 1941 when the relocation of Karelian evacuees threatened to shift the balance between Finnish and Swedish speakers in Swedish-speaking municipalities, and has functioned continuously since its re-establishment. Since 2003, its operations have been governed by law.

==Elections==
Elections are held every four years, and candidates are nominated by the political parties which are either bilingual or Swedish-speaking. The assembly has 75 seats, where 70 are filled on the basis of municipal election results, and five are appointed by the Parliament of Åland (). 

==Purpose==
The assembly is a forum for political discussion on issues concerning Swedish speakers, and it also functions as an interest group for the Swedish-speaking population. It also engages in research on demographic issues and publishes information to the public about the situation of the Swedish-speaking Finns. 

==Leadership==
Astrid Thors was chairperson of the Swedish Assembly of Finland from 2005 to 2007. She was succeeded by Ulla-Maj Wideroos in 2007, by Anna-Maja Henriksson in 2009, by Christina Gestrin in 2011, by Thomas Blomqvist in 2015 and by Sandra Bergqvist in 2019.

<text>Allan Turner Howe (September 6, 1927 – December 14, 2000) was a U.S. Representative from Utah.

Born in South Cottonwood near Murray, Utah, Howe attended public schools before receiving a B.S. from the University of Utah in 1952 and a J.D.L. from the same university in 1954. He served in the United States Coast Guard from 1946 to 1947.

He held a number of legal and governmental jobs, including as deputy Salt Lake County attorney, South Salt Lake city attorney, administrative assistant and field representative to U.S. Senator Frank E. Moss from 1959 to 1964, assistant attorney general of Utah from 1965 to 1966, administrative assistant to Governor Cal Rampton from 1966 to 1968, and executive director of the Four Corners Regional Development Commission from 1968 to 1972. He also practiced law in Salt Lake City, served as a delegate to Utah State Democratic conventions from 1954 to 1960 and was an alternate delegate to the 1960 Democratic National Convention.

Howe was elected as a Democrat to the Ninety-fourth Congress in 1974.

==Arrest==
On June 13, 1976, Howe was arrested in Salt Lake City on misdemeanor charges of soliciting sex for hire after propositioning a police officer posing undercover as a prostitute. As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints representing a district where most voters were members of the church, and amidst a rash of other congressional scandals in the summer of 1976, Howe had maintained that politicians&#x27; private moral behavior was relevant to their public service. Howe claimed that he was innocent, a victim of a politically motivated &quot;set-up.&quot;

He retained the endorsement of local Democratic officials as he&#x27;d already been nominated at the party convention. Despite the party&#x27;s efforts, he refused to step down, and the state Democratic Party executive committee then voted to co-endorse Daryl J. McCarty as a write-in candidate. Howe ultimately lost reelection to Republican Dan Marriott in November 1976.

== Later career ==

He was convicted of solicitation, and the conviction was upheld on appeal. Following his electoral defeat, Howe stayed in Washington, D.C., and worked as a lobbyist, including, at the end of his career, for the National Park and Hospitality Association.

== Death ==
He died in Arlington, Virginia, on December 14, 2000, at the age of 73.

<doc id="986527" wikidata="Q1073093" url="?curid=986527" title="Chimanimani District">
<text>Chimanimani, originally known as Melsetter, is a mountainous district in Manicaland Province of eastern Zimbabwe. The district headquarters is the town of Chimanimani.

==Geography==
The district has an area of 3,450.14 km2. It is bounded to the east by Mozambique, to the north and northwest by Mutare District, to the west by Buhera District, and to the south by Chipinge District.

The Chimanimani Mountains extend through the eastern part of the district, stretching for some 50 km (31 mi) and forming the border with Mozambique. The mountains are distinguished by large peaks, carved from a rifted quartzite massif. The highest peak is Monte Binga at 2,436 m (8,005 ft). Chimanimani National Park (171.1 km2) protects the Zimbabwean portion of the range.

The Haroni River runs from north to south in a steep-sided valley west of the Chimanimani massif. It joins the Rusitu River in the southwest corner of the district, which then flows east into Mozambique to join the Buzi River. The village of Chimanimani lies west of the Haroni.

Lower mountains run north and south through the center of the district. The western portion of the district lies in the valley of the Save River and its tributary the Odzi, which form the district&#x27;s western boundary.

==People==
The population of the district was 134,939 in the 2012 census. The district&#x27;s population is 94% rural.

==Administration==
The district is divided into 23 administrative wards. The administrative headquarters are in the town of Chimanimani.

The district is divided into two Assembly parliamentary constituencies, Chimanimani East and Chimanimani West. Chimanimani Senate constituency includes the entire district together with Mutare South and Mutare West.

==Transport==
The district has three tarred roads. The main road between Mutare and Masvingo (P4, formerly A9) passes through the western edge of the district. The A10 road branches off the P4 in Wengezi in the district&#x27;s northwestern corner, and runs north and south through the center of the district. A branch road connects Chimanimani town to the A10.

A road branches eastwards from the northern portion of the A10, extending through Cashel to border post with Mozambique.

==History==
Cyclone Idai struck the district on 15 March 2019, bringing high winds and torrential rains that caused extensive flooding. The cyclone caused at least 169 deaths in the district, and extensive damage to crops, houses, and roads.

==Chimanimani Mountains==

Much of the range is composed of quartzite ridges, with Monte Binga (2,436m) the highest peak in the range and second-highest peak in Zimbabwe. The mountains are home to montane woodlands and grasslands, highland tropical forests, and high-elevation grasslands and heathlands.

The Chimanimani Mountains are protected by Chimanimani National Park, and are one of Zimbabwe&#x27;s finest mountain wilderness areas and a popular hiking destination. Scenic Bridal Veil Falls are within the national park, close to the town of Chimanimani.

During the Zimbabwe independence war, mountain passes in the Chimanimani area were frequently used by guerilla fighters between Zimbabwe and their camps in Mozambique, who laid mines along local roads to disrupt the local economy. Because of this, the passes were heavily mined by Rhodesian government forces. Land mines have continued to be a real hazard in the area, particularly after heavy rain.

==Chimanimani town==
The town of Chimanimani was founded by Thomas Moodie in 1892 and in 1895 it was moved to its current site and was officially called Melsetter after Moodie&#x27;s family home in Scotland. The name was changed in 1982, after Zimbabwean independence (1980). The name initially was made Mandidzudzure, but after consultation with local residents, this was changed again to the current one. According to the 1982 Population Census, the town has a population of 1,370. The town had a tourist office, a bank, grocery, curio shops and the faded colonial Chimanimani Arms Hotel. In 1995 it also had a travellers&#x27; hostel called Heaven, with a permaculture smallholding which was a popular source of employment in the village. Frog &amp; Fern Cottages on the way to Bridal Veil Falls provide self-catering cottages within walking distance of the town.

The Chimanimani Arts Festival was a free music festival that began in 1998, and was held in August of each year. It was discontinued during Zimbabwe&#x27;s post-2013 political crisis.

<doc id="986530" wikidata="Q5608731" url="?curid=986530" title="Grievous Angels">
<text>Grievous Angels are a Canadian alternative country band, active since 1986. The band&#x27;s name is a reference to the Gram Parsons album &quot;Grievous Angel&quot;. Their primary leader is singer-songwriter Charlie Angus, who entered electoral politics in 2004 as the New Democratic Party Member of Parliament for Timmins-James Bay.

==Early years==
The group was originally formed in Toronto in 1986 by Angus, vocalist Michelle Rumball and fiddler Peter Jellard after Angus left the punk rock band L&#x27;Étranger. They began as a collective of street buskers, and eventually began playing Toronto-area bars, specifically the old Cabana Room of the Spadina Hotel. Tim Hadley and drummer Peter Duffin joined the band in 1987. The band quickly became a popular draw at folk festivals across Canada, and released their debut album, &quot;Toute la Gang&quot;, in 1989.

They followed up with &quot;One Job Town&quot; in 1990, garnering national radio airplay for the singles &quot;Gordie and My Old Man&quot; and &quot;Crossing the Causeway&quot;. Reviewers lauded the album, with Richard Wagamese of the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; calling it the Canadian equivalent of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Nebraska&quot;. However, Rumball was suffering from voice problems at this time and did not participate in the tour to support the album, with vocals instead being performed by Lynn Simmons and Kirsti MacLeod. The album was nominated for Best Roots or Traditional Album at the Juno Awards of 1991, and the band was nominated for Best Country Group or Duo at the Juno Awards of 1992.

==Return to Northern Ontario==
Around this time, Rumball left the band and Angus moved to Cobalt, Ontario. The band scaled back for a time, performing only in the Northern Ontario region as they prepared their third album, &quot;Watershed&quot;; the album was marked by Angus taking over lead vocals, and addressed the changes in his life in songs such as &quot;Starting Over at Thirty&quot; and &quot;North of the Watershed&quot;. They were named one of the hottest up-and-coming bands in Canada by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in 1994.

In 1995, Angus launched &quot;HighGrader&quot;, a magazine about Northern Ontario life and culture, and joined CBC Radio One as a correspondent and commentator for its Sudbury station CBCS.

In 1996, Grievous Angels released &quot;Waiting for the Cage&quot;, a concept album about life in Northern Ontario mining towns which also included an interactive CD-ROM feature. The CD-ROM feature won an award from the New York Expo of Short Film and Video.

In 1999, Angus was presented the Jackie Washington Award, for his contributions to Northern Ontario&#x27;s cultural life, by Sudbury&#x27;s Northern Lights Festival Boréal. The band also released &quot;22 Trailer Park&quot; that year.

In the summer of 2000, Duffin retired from the band, and Hadley accepted a gig touring with Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors. Duffin was replaced by Dave Patterson. Drummer Al Lamore also joined the band. During this era, Angus became involved in political activism in the campaign against the proposal to ship Toronto&#x27;s garbage to the abandoned Adams Mine in Kirkland Lake.

The band released &quot;Hanging Songs&quot; in 2003. The album included a song about the Adams Mine campaign.

==Hiatus==
The following year, Angus ran for the New Democratic Party nomination in Timmins-James Bay; he won the nomination and used his musical background as part of his campaign, most notably performing Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors&#x27; &quot;The Hockey Song&quot; and Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; as duets with Jack Layton when Layton made a visit to Timmins. He won the seat in the 2004 election. He kept a previously-booked engagement at the Northern Lights Festival Boréal the following week before the band went on hiatus; however, Angus continued to use music as part of his political career, sometimes performing songs at political rallies and meetings.

The band returned to recording in 2011 with a single, &quot;Diamonds in the Snow&quot;, recorded with Angus&#x27; former L&#x27;Étranger bandmate Andrew Cash. Cash was by this time also a Member of Parliament, and he and Angus jointly led a number of NDP caucus singalongs, including &quot;Bud the Spud&quot; upon the death of Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors, and &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; upon the Alberta New Democratic Party&#x27;s victory in the 2015 Alberta general election.

In 2013, the band released the album &quot;Great Divide&quot;. The song &quot;Four Horses&quot; was influenced by the book &quot;Clearing the Plains&quot;, and was made into a video with the University of Regina Press.

The band have also returned to playing select folk festival dates.

In 2021, the band released the album &quot;Summer Before the Storm&quot;, their first new album in eight years. The lineup saw Angus, Jellard, and Hadley joined by new members Janet Mercier on vocals, Ian McKendry on guitar, and Nathan Mahaffy on drums. Skydiggers vocalist Andy Maize contributes guest vocals on several tracks.

In 2024 they released &quot;Last Call for Cinderella&quot;, their eighth album.

<doc id="986545" wikidata="Q5609429" url="?curid=986545" title="Joseph S. Clark Jr.">
<text>Joseph Sill Clark Jr. (October 21, 1901January 12, 1990) was an American writer, lawyer and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 90th Mayor of Philadelphia from 1952 to 1956 and as a United States senator from Pennsylvania from 1957 to 1969. Clark was the only Unitarian Universalist elected to a major office in Pennsylvania in the modern era.

The son of attorney and tennis player Joseph Sill Clark Sr., Clark pursued a legal career in Philadelphia after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He became involved in a reform movement that sought to break the power of the city&#x27;s Republican political machine. After serving in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, Clark won election as city controller in 1949. In this capacity, he investigated and publicized scandals in the city government. In 1951, Clark won election as Mayor of Philadelphia, becoming the first Democrat to do so since 1884. As mayor, he sought to reduce corruption in city government and created low-income housing projects.

After one term as mayor, Clark narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Senator James H. Duff in the 1956 Senate election. Clark earned a reputation as a strong supporter of civil rights and worked to appoint liberal committee members from his perch on the Democratic Steering Committee. Clark narrowly won re-election in 1962 but was defeated in 1968 by Congressman Richard Schweiker. His defeat is generally credited to his support of gun control and opposition to the Vietnam War. After leaving office, Clark became a professor at Temple University.

==Early life and education==
One of two children, Joseph Clark was born in Philadelphia to Joseph Sill Clark Sr. and Kate Richardson Avery. His father, a longtime lawyer in the Germantown section of the city, was also a national tennis champion who won the 1885 U.S. National Championship in doubles with Dick Sears. His mother, whose family owned Avery Island in Louisiana, was the niece of Edmund McIlhenny, the inventor of Tabasco sauce. Clark was raised in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, and received his early education at Chestnut Hill Academy. He then attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he played on the school&#x27;s baseball and football teams. He graduated from Middlesex in 1919 as class valedictorian.

Clark studied at Harvard University, where he was a member of the baseball and track teams. He won several prizes, including the John Harvard scholarship for high academic distinction. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1923 with a Bachelor of Science degree in government, history and economics. Clark, who had spent time at the Bar B C Dude Ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, became a partner in the nearby Double Diamond Dude Ranch in 1924. He later returned to Philadelphia and enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he was a member of St. Anthony Hall and editor of the &quot;Law Review&quot;. He earned his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1926.

==Early career==
In December 1926, Clark was admitted to the bar and became an associate with his father&#x27;s law firm of Clark, Clark, McCarthy and Wagner. That same year, he made his first entry into politics when he unsuccessfully ran as a progressive candidate for Republican committeeman. In 1928, he left the Republican Party and became a Democrat, supporting Al Smith in that year&#x27;s presidential election.

During the 1928 election, Clark founded the Democratic Warriors Club with Richardson Dilworth, beginning a long political partnership between the two. Both men became active in the reform movement to end corruption in city government, which was long controlled by a Republican machine. Clark was an unsuccessful candidate for the Philadelphia City Council in 1933, with Dilworth serving as his campaign manager. The following year, he joined the firm of Dechert, Bok, Smith and Clark, and continued to practice law for seven years. He managed Dilworth&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1934. From 1934 to 1935, he served as Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania. In this capacity, he engaged in trial work related to the closing of banks.

In August 1941, Clark enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces (AAF) and was assigned as a captain in the Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps Headquarters at Washington, D.C. He later became director of the Organizational Planning Headquarters with the AAF. Following the entry of the United States into World War II, he was transferred to the China Burma India Theater as deputy chief of staff to General George E. Stratemeyer. He briefly served as acting chief of staff to General Stratemeyer, and attained the rank of colonel on October 15, 1943. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Legion of Merit, and Military Order of the British Empire. Returning to the United States in September 1945, he accompanied General Stratemeyer to Washington, D.C., where he helped design plans to defend the nation against air raids.

Following his return to Philadelphia, Clark resumed his political activity and his partnership with Dilworth. He was manager of Dilworth&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for Mayor of Philadelphia against Republican incumbent Bernard Samuel in 1947. He then served as chairman of the citizens&#x27; committee for President Harry S. Truman in the 1948 election, and as chairman of the Philadelphia chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action from 1948 to 1949. Running as a reform Democrat, Clark was elected city controller in 1949, winning by more than 100,000 votes. Meanwhile, Dilworth was elected city treasurer by a similar margin. Serving from 1950 to 1952, Clark investigated and publicized scandals within the Republican-controlled city government, including the embezzlement of tax money and court funds, imprisonment of the fire marshal, falsification of records, and corruption in the water bureau. Many officials were impeached or indicted as a result, and nine even committed suicide.

==Mayor of Philadelphia==
Clark announced his candidacy for mayor of Philadelphia in May 1951. Democratic leaders had wanted Dilworth to run, but Clark released a press statement declaring his &quot;irrevocable decision to run for mayor.&quot; Instead, Dilworth successfully ran for District Attorney of Philadelphia. Running on his record as city controller, Clark often used a broom while campaigning as a symbol of his pledge to &quot;sweep out&quot; corruption. His Republican challenger was Daniel A. Poling, a Baptist clergyman and editor of the &quot;Christian Herald&quot;. Clark was endorsed by several labor unions, Americans for Democratic Action, and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. On November 6, 1951, he defeated Poling by 124,700 votes. With his victory, Clark became the first Democrat to be elected mayor of Philadelphia since 1884; as of 2021, no member of another party has since held the office.

Clark was inaugurated as the 90th Mayor of Philadelphia on January 7, 1952. He was the first mayor to serve under Philadelphia&#x27;s Home Rule Charter, which had reorganized city government by merging Philadelphia&#x27;s city and county offices, establishing a limit of two successive terms for mayor, replacing patronage with a merit system for civil servants, and giving the mayor increased administrative, legislative, and investigative powers. During his administration, he reduced corruption within the Police Department and appointed several African Americans to city jobs. He adopted a $20 million tax increase and established a pay-as-you-go system. He created low-income housing projects, also establishing the position of housing coordinator. He also refused to accept personal gifts. His tenure also saw the transformation of the Penn Center and the Philadelphia waterfront.

In 1952, Clark launched a television series &quot;Tell It To the Mayor&quot; in which he and other city officials answered questions about his administration. He endorsed Senator Estes Kefauver for the Democratic nomination in the 1952 presidential election. In 1955, he chartered the Food Distribution Center Corporation to create a new food market, and established the Urban Traffic and Transportation Board to design a mass transit system.

In 1956, Clark became the first politician to receive the Philadelphia Award for promoting good governance in the city.

Clark, who had promised to serve as mayor for only one term, did not run for reelection. As of 2021, only one other person has since served just one term as mayor: William J. Green III, who was elected in 1979.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Clark as the twenty-second-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

==U.S. Senate==
Clark announced his candidacy for the United States Senate in 1956. After winning the Democratic nomination over the opposition of Philadelphia&#x27;s party leaders, he faced first-term Republican incumbent James H. Duff, a popular former governor, in the general election. During the campaign, Clark ran on a liberal platform which included support for increasing the minimum wage, expanding Social Security, and repealing the Taft–Hartley Act. He also criticized President Dwight D. Eisenhower on international and domestic matters, and attacked Senator Duff&#x27;s poor attendance record. On November 6, 1956, Clark narrowly defeated Duff by a margin of 50.1%-49.7%, winning by less than 18,000 out of 4.5 million votes cast. At the same time in the presidential election, President Eisenhower, who by this time claimed his farm in Gettysburg as his permanent address, carried Pennsylvania by well over 600,000 votes.

During his early tenure in the Senate, Clark earned a reputation as a strong supporter of civil rights and congressional reform. He sponsored the Manpower Development and Training Act and the Area Redevelopment Act. He often clashed with Lyndon B. Johnson while the latter was Senate Majority Leader. In 1962, Clark was re-elected to a second term after narrowly defeating Congressman James E. Van Zandt by a 51%-49% margin.

Clark was appointed to the Democratic Steering Committee in 1963, but conservative Southern Democrats thwarted his efforts to appoint more liberal Senators to committees. He was a critic of the Senate itself, which he called a &quot;self-perpetuating oligarchy&quot; in a 1963 address on the Senate floor. He challenged the seniority system and the filibuster. In 1964, he endorsed Genevieve Blatt, the state Secretary of Internal Affairs, over Judge Michael Musmanno in the Democratic senatorial primary. Clark&#x27;s opposition to Musmanno was not well received by the Italian American community, who largely voted against Clark in 1968. A member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he voted for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964 but soon became an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War, condemning the war&#x27;s escalation in 1965.

In 1968, Clark was defeated for re-election to a third term by Congressman Richard Schweiker, losing 52% to 46%. His defeat is generally ascribed to his support of gun control, especially the 1968 Gun Control Act, and opposition to the Vietnam War. His campaign chairman in 1968 was Bucks County author James A. Michener.

==Later life and death==
Following his departure from the Senate, Clark served as a professor at Temple University in 1969. He was president of World Federalists U.S.A., an organization promoting the creation of a world government, from 1969 to 1971. He also served as chairman of the Coalition on National Priorities and Military Policy, and continued to attend meetings of Members of Congress for Peace Through Law. A strong opponent of Mayor Frank Rizzo, he supported Bill Green III in the 1971 Democratic primary and then Republican W. Thacher Longstreth in the general election. He was chairman of independent candidate Charles Bowser&#x27;s campaign in 1975. He was an elected member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

Clark died at his home in Chestnut Hill, at age 88. His remains were cremated and interred at St. Thomas&#x27; Church Cemetery in Whitemarsh Township, Pennsylvania.

==Personal life and family==
Joseph Clark was descended from a prominent financial family in Philadelphia. His great-grandfather, Enoch White Clark, was the founder of E. W. Clark &amp; Co. Enoch&#x27;s son Edward was Clark&#x27;s paternal grandfather and brother of Clarence Howard Clark Sr. Clarence Sr.&#x27;s son Clarence Jr. served as president of the Centennial National Bank. Clark was the nephew of Edward Walter Clark Jr., commodore of the Philadelphia Corinthian Yacht Club and father of Edward III; Clarence Munroe Clark, a noted tennis player like his brother; and Percy Clark, a lawyer and noted cricketer. Percy&#x27;s daughter Mary was married to Nelson Rockefeller from 1930 to 1962, before he served as Vice President of the United States.

Clark&#x27;s paternal grandmother was the daughter of Joseph and Jane (née Todhunter) Sill, who were social reformers and leaders in antebellum Philadelphia&#x27;s benevolence movement. Joseph Sill served as secretary, vice president, and president of the St. George Society of Philadelphia, an aid organization for English immigrants.

Clark was married three times and had two children. He and his first wife, Elizabeth Story Jenks, had one son, Joseph S. Clark III. He was married to his second wife, Noel Hall, from April 1935 until their divorce in September 1967. He and Noel had one daughter, Noel Clairborne Clark. Two weeks after his divorce, Clark married Iris Cole Richey, a former editor of the &quot;Pennsylvania Manual&quot;, to whom he remained married until his death.

<text>M. Georges Valensi (1889–1980) was a French telecommunications engineer who, in 1938, invented and patented a method of transmitting color images via luma and chrominance so that they could be received on both color and black &amp; white television sets. Rival color television methods, which had been in development since the 1920s, were incompatible with monochrome televisions.

Valensi was an official of CCIF serving first as Secretary-General (1923–1948) and then as Director (1949–1956).

All current widely deployed color television broadcast standards – NTSC, SECAM, PAL and today&#x27;s digital standards, and importantly digital image data compression – implement some form of his idea of reducing a signal to a separate luminance with chrominance encoded separately. The original patents expired in 1962.

<doc id="986563" wikidata="Q7153216" url="?curid=986563" title="Paul Richards (baseball)">
<text>Paul Rapier Richards (November 21, 1908 – May 4, 1986) was an American professional baseball player, manager, scout and executive in Major League Baseball. During his playing career, he was a catcher and right-handed batter with the Brooklyn Dodgers (1932), New York Giants (1933–1935), Philadelphia Athletics (1935) and Detroit Tigers (1943–1946). After retiring, he became the manager of the Chicago White Sox (1951–1954, 1976) and Baltimore Orioles (1955–1961). He also served as the general manager for the Orioles, the Houston Colt .45s / Astros and the Atlanta Braves.

==Baseball playing career==

Born in Waxahachie, Texas, Richards began his professional baseball career in the minor leagues as an infielder in 1926 at the age of 17. In a baseball oddity, Richards pitched with both hands in a minor-league game on July 23, 1928, for the Muskogee Chiefs of the Class C Western Association against the Topeka Jayhawks. Called to the pitcher&#x27;s mound from his shortstop position, he pitched both right-handed and left-handed in a brief appearance, including facing a switch hitter, which briefly resulted in both pitcher and batter switching hands and batter&#x27;s boxes, respectively, until Richards broke the stalemate by alternating hands with each pitch, regardless of where the batter positioned himself. Later in his minor league career, he became a catcher.

After playing for seven years in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut at the age of 23 with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 17, 1932. Richards&#x27; contract was then purchased by the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association in June 1932. In 78 games with Minneapolis, he posted a .361 batting average and, he was subsequently purchased by John McGraw&#x27;s New York Giants in September 1932.

With the Giants, Richards served as a reserve catcher working behind Gus Mancuso for the 1933 season. Richards&#x27; future managing style was influenced by his time spent playing for Giants manager Bill Terry. Terry&#x27;s no-nonsense style of managing that concentrated on pitching and defense, made an impact on Richards. The Giants went on to win the 1933 World Series however, Richards did not get to play in the post-season. After Richards batted just .160 in 1934, he was traded in May 1935 to Connie Mack&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics. He caught the majority of the Athletics&#x27; games in 1935 before being traded to the Atlanta Crackers for pitcher Al Williams in November.

Richards was already showing a keen baseball mind as Atlanta&#x27;s catcher in 1936 when he helped turn around pitcher Dutch Leonard&#x27;s career. After three seasons in the major leagues with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Leonard had been sent back to the minor leagues where he played with Richards in Atlanta. Richards encouraged him to throw a knuckleball and, within two years, Leonard was back in the major leagues with the Washington Senators, where he became a 20-game winner in 1939. Richards played for the Crackers from 1936 to 1942. From 1938 to 1942, he served as a player-manager for the Crackers. Richards led the Crackers to the pennant in 1938 and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named him as minor league manager of the year.

When professional baseball experienced a shortage of players during World War II, Richards returned to the major leagues in 1943 with the Detroit Tigers at the age of 34. While his batting average was a relatively low .220 in 100 games played, he led the American League catchers in fielding percentage, range factor, baserunners caught stealing and putouts and, finished second in assists. Richards also served as an unofficial pitching coach for manager Steve O&#x27;Neill. His strong defensive play continued in 1944, leading the league&#x27;s catchers in fielding percentage, range factor and baserunners caught stealing percentage, and finished second in putouts and baserunners caught stealing as, the Tigers lost the pennant on the last day of the season.

In 1945, Richards&#x27; batting average improved to career-high .256 and he once again led the league&#x27;s catchers in fielding percentage and in range factor, as the Tigers won the American League championship, then, defeated the Chicago Cubs in the 1945 World Series. In the deciding Game 7 of the series, he hit 2 doubles and had 4 runs batted in. Richards was the Tigers&#x27; starting catcher in six games of the seven-game series and, contributed 6 runs batted in, second only to the 7 produced by Hank Greenberg. Despite his low batting average, he ended the season ranked in 10th place in the 1945 American League Most Valuable Player Award voting, due in part to his handling of the Tigers&#x27; pitching staff which led the league in winning percentage, strikeouts, shutouts and finished second in earned run average. Richards was one of the annual &quot;The Sporting News&quot; All-Stars for 1945.

After hitting only .201 in 1946, he returned to the minor leagues, playing three more seasons as a player-manager with the Buffalo Bisons. He led Buffalo to the International League pennant in 1949 before, retiring as a player at the age of 40.

==Career statistics==
In an eight-year major league career, Richards played in 523 games, accumulating 321 hits in 1,417 at bats for a .227 career batting average along with 15 home runs and 155 runs batted in. In 17 minor league seasons, he posted a career .295 batting average with 171 home runs. While he was a light-hitting player, he excelled as a defensive catcher, ending his career with a .987 fielding percentage. He led American League catchers three times in range factor, twice in fielding percentage and once each in baserunners caught stealing and in caught stealing percentage. Richard&#x27;s 50.34% career caught stealing percentage ranks 12th all-time among major league catchers.

==Managing and executive career==

Richards became a successful manager with the Chicago White Sox in 1951. In a baseball era when many teams relied on home runs for much of their offensive production, Richards went against the perceived common wisdom by relying on pitching, good defense, speed and stolen bases to manufacture runs with a strategy now known as small ball. It was during that stint that he once had starting pitcher Billy Pierce play first base for one batter, bringing in a right handed pitcher to face a right handed hitter, taking out the starting first baseman, and then replacing him when Pierce went back to pitch one hitter later. The White Sox led the American League in stolen bases for 11 consecutive years from to 1961. He managed the White Sox to four winning-record seasons, but his club finished behind the New York Yankees (1951, 1952, 1953), and the Cleveland Indians in 1954. It was during his tenure as the White Sox manager that he was given the nickname, &quot;The Wizard of Waxahachie.&quot;

In September 1954, Richards was hired by the Baltimore Orioles, where he served as both field manager and general manager through 1958, becoming the first man since John McGraw to hold both positions simultaneously. As general manager, he was involved in a 17-player trade with the New York Yankees that remains the biggest trade in baseball history. Richards concentrated on signing good defensive players (such as Brooks Robinson) and hard-throwing young pitchers (such as Steve Barber, Milt Pappas and Chuck Estrada). After Lee MacPhail was hired as the general manager in 1959, Richards served strictly as the Orioles&#x27; field manager. The Orioles finally blossomed in 1960 with a second-place finish after five disappointing seasons. The Orioles&#x27; second-place finish was Richards&#x27; best as a manager. Both the Associated Press and United Press International named him the American League Manager of the Year.

Richards led American League managers in ejections for 11 consecutive seasons from 1951 to 1961, setting an all-time managerial record. In September 1961, Richards resigned as manager of the Orioles to become general manager of the new Houston Colt .45s National League club. Richards stocked the Houston club (soon renamed the Astros) with young players – including Joe Morgan, Jimmy Wynn, Mike Cuellar, Don Wilson and Rusty Staub – but he was fired after the 1965 season when the on-field results did not match owner Roy Hofheinz&#x27; expectations.

The following year, Richards was hired as director of player personnel by the Atlanta Braves – returning to the city where he excelled as a minor league catcher and player-manager for the Southern Association&#x27;s Atlanta Crackers from 1938 to 1942. By the end of the season, Richards was given the title of general manager of the Braves. Richards&#x27; six years at the helm of the Atlanta organization were in some ways his most successful in baseball. He inherited a strong core of players including Henry Aaron, Joe Torre, Felipe Alou, and Rico Carty. He added several young pitchers and position players to the mix and converted knuckleballing reliever Phil Niekro into a successful starter. His 1969 Braves, skippered by his longtime protege Luman Harris, won the National League Western Division title, but that team was swept by the eventual world champion &quot;Miracle Mets&quot; in the first National League Championship Series ever played. The Braves failed to contend in 1970 and 1971 and, Richards was fired in the middle of the 1972 season, replaced by Eddie Robinson.

In 1976, after three and a half years out of the game, Richards was hired by Bill Veeck to return to Chicago as manager of the White Sox. After a losing record, he retired from the field at the end of the season, but stayed in the game as a player personnel advisor with the White Sox, and the Texas Rangers. As a manager, he compiled a 923–901 record in 11 seasons (406-362 with Chicago, 517–539 with Baltimore).

Richards was credited in helping Sherm Lollar become one of the best catchers in the major leagues and, he also helped Gus Triandos become a respectable catcher. He is known for designing the oversized catcher&#x27;s mitt first used by Triandos to catch Hall of Fame knuckleball pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm. Despite his skills as a motivator, mentor and strategist of the game, Richards never was able to lead a team to a pennant. Sixteen of his players became major league managers.

Richards died of a heart attack in Waxahachie, Texas at the age of 77. In 1996, Richards was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame. Paul Richards Park in Waxahachie has been named a Texas Historical Landmark.

===Waxahachie swap===
Beginning in 1951, Richards reintroduced and was erroneously credited with inventing a tactic which had not been used in the major leagues since 1909. Four or five times in his career, Richards shifted a pitcher to the outfield and inserted a new pitcher in order to gain a platoon advantage before putting the original pitcher back on the mound. Rob Neyer, writing for ESPN.com in 2009, endorsed a reader&#x27;s suggestion and introduced a name for the gambit, &quot;the Waxahachie Swap.&quot;

<doc id="986580" wikidata="Q1971625" url="?curid=986580" title="Tar paper">
<text>Tar paper, roofing paper, felt paper, underlayment, or roofing tar paper is a heavy-duty paper used in construction. Tar paper is made by impregnating paper with tar, producing a waterproof material useful for roof construction. Tar paper is similar to roofing felt, historically a felt-like fabric made from recycled rags impregnated with melted asphalt, and today evolving into a more complex underlayment of synthetic mesh or fiberglass strands waterproofed by synthetically enhanced asphalt.

==Description==
Tar paper has been in use for centuries. It is defined as a Grade D building paper—a designation derived from a federal specification in the United States. Sometimes anachronistically referred to as &quot;building paper&quot;, tar paper is manufactured from virgin kraft paper (as opposed to the fabric-based or synthetic mesh substrates of roofing felt) impregnated with asphalt. The result is a lighter-weight but less durable product with similar properties to felt.

Grade papers are rated in minutes: the amount of time it takes for a moisture-sensitive chemical indicator to change color when a small boat-like sample is floated on water. Common grades include 10-, 20-, 30-, and 60-minute. The higher the rating, the heavier and more moisture-resistant the paper. A typical 20-minute paper will weigh about per square, a 30-minute paper per square, and a 60-minute paper about per square. The smaller volume of material, however, does tend to make these papers less resistant to moisture than heavier felts.

==Uses==
Tar paper is used as a roofing underlayment with asphalt, wood, shake, and other roof shingles as a form of intermediate bituminous waterproofing. It is sold in rolls of various widths, lengths, and thicknesses – rolls, long and &quot;15 lb&quot; () and &quot;30 lb&quot; () weights are common in the U.S. – often marked with chalk lines at certain intervals to aid in laying it out straight on roofs with the proper overlap (more overlap for flatter roofs).

It is typically stapled in place, or held with roofing nails, and is sometimes applied in several layers with hot asphalt, cold asphalt (adhesive), or non-asphaltic adhesives.

Older construction typically used a lighter-weight tar paper, stapled up with some overlap, as a water- and wind-proofing material on walls, largely displaced in recent decades by breathable plastic housewrap, commonly in widths.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, shacks of wooden frames covered with tar paper were a common form of temporary structure or very low-cost permanent housing in the rural United States and Canada, particularly in the temperate American South.

<text>The extended file system, or ext, was implemented in April 1992 as the first file system created specifically for the Linux kernel. Although ext is not a specific file system name, it has been succeeded by ext2, ext3, and ext4. It has metadata structure inspired by traditional Unix filesystem principles, and was designed by Rémy Card to overcome certain limitations of the MINIX file system. It was the first implementation that used the virtual file system (VFS), for which support was added in the Linux kernel in version 0.96c, and it could handle file systems up to 2 gigabytes (GB) in size.

ext was the first in the series of extended file systems. In 1993, it was superseded by both ext2 and Xiafs, which competed for a time, but ext2 won because of its long-term viability: ext2 remedied issues with ext, such as the immutability of inodes and fragmentation.

== Other extended file systems ==
There are other members in the extended file system family:
* ext2, the second extended file system.
* ext3, the third extended file system.
* ext4, the fourth extended file system.

<doc id="986592" wikidata="Q7548990" url="?curid=986592" title="SoDo, Seattle">
<text>SoDo (alternatively SODO) is a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, that makes up part of the city&#x27;s Industrial District. It is bounded on the north by South King Street, beyond which is Pioneer Square; on the south by South Spokane Street, beyond which is more of the Industrial District; on the west by the Duwamish River, across which is West Seattle; and on the east by Metro Transit&#x27;s Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and SoDo Busway, beyond which is the International District and the rest of the Industrial District.

SoDo was originally named for being located &quot;&quot;So&quot;uth of the &quot;Do&quot;me&quot;, but since the Kingdome&#x27;s demolition in 2000 the name has been taken to mean &quot;&quot;So&quot;uth of &quot;Do&quot;wntown&quot;. The moniker was adopted in the 1990s after the renaming of the Sears building to the SODO Center (later Starbucks Center, the world headquarters of Starbucks at First Avenue S. and S. Lander Street). It includes Seattle&#x27;s downtown stadium district of T-Mobile Park (where Major League Baseball&#x27;s Seattle Mariners play their home baseball games) and Lumen Field (built on the former Kingdome site; where the NFL&#x27;s Seattle Seahawks play their home football games and where Major League Soccer&#x27;s Seattle Sounders FC along with the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League&#x27;s Seattle Reign FC play their home soccer matches). The Mariners&#x27; popular marketing campaign in the early 2000s used the SoDo moniker in the catchphrase &quot;SoDo Mojo&quot;.

SoDo deliberately echoes SoHo in New York City, where, during the 1970s, cheap spaces vacated by departing factories were converted by artists into lofts and studios.

SoDo has undergone a similar process but has not experienced much of the gentrification experienced by its putative model. Some of SoDo&#x27;s warehouse buildings remain in their original use; others have been carved up for artists&#x27; lofts, art galleries, and an assortment of other businesses. As one travels farther south along First Avenue S., these conversions peter out, and light manufacturing, warehouses, and warehouse-style retail stores predominate.

==Demographics==

As of the 2000 United States census, SoDo had a population of 2,602, with a median age of 41.2, in 458 owner-occupied residences and 536 rentals. The average annual household income was $42,208. The racial breakdown was 41% White, 28% Asian, 14% Black, 9% Hispanic/Latino, 3% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 5% other.

==Transportation==

SoDo main thoroughfares are First and Fourth Avenues S. and Alaskan Way S. (north- and south-bound) and S. Lander and Holgate Streets, Edgar Martínez Drive S., and S. Royal Brougham Way (east- and west-bound). The western terminus of Interstate 90, which travels east towards Boston, Massachusetts, is in SoDo.

The neighborhood is also served by public transit service. Sound Transit operates the 1 Line light rail service through the neighborhood, stopping at two stations: SODO at Lander Street, and Stadium at Royal Brougham Way. The SODO Busway runs along 5th Avenue South and carries bus routes from King County Metro and Sound Transit Express.

<doc id="986593" wikidata="Q1607137" url="?curid=986593" title="Point forward">
<text>Point forward is a nontraditional position in basketball, with a small forward—or sometimes a power forward or combo forward—adding the responsibilities of point guard to their play.

== Characteristics ==
Generally, teams employ a point forward when their best playmaker is a forward rather than a guard. A point forward is typically responsible for bringing the ball up the court and being the primary facilitator on offense to generate assists, but they may merely direct play once a guard brings the ball up-court.

Assuming the role of point forward may cut down on that player&#x27;s scoring, as distributing the ball to others decreases shot attempts. Basketball Hall of Fame small forward Larry Bird, a prolific scorer with exceptional passing skills, quipped &quot;I&#x27;m a point forward now&quot; after his coaches sought him to score less and pass more.

Don Nelson, a coach often associated with the point forward in his Nellie Ball system, used the role when his guards were not strong ball-handlers. Other coaches have used point forwards to free their guards to score more, a strategy of increasing importance as the three-point shot has become the sport&#x27;s primary offensive weapon.

ESPN analyst Dave Telep maintained a point forward needed to be more than merely an adept passer but also had to facilitate the offense for teammates at least half of the time.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term &quot;point forward&quot; is cloudy. Two former members of the NBA&#x27;s Milwaukee Bucks claim to have coined it: Bucks small forward Marques Johnson maintains he created it during the 1984 playoffs when the team became short on point guards after Nate Archibald was sidelined with a hamstring injury. When coach Don Nelson instructed Johnson to run the offense he says he responded, &quot;OK, so instead of a point guard, I&#x27;m a point forward&quot;. Then-Bucks assistant coach Del Harris claims he first mentioned the term to Nelson while discussing how to best use Paul Pressey. Harris says he came up with the term while coaching Robert Reid with the Houston Rockets. Harris credits his predecessor as Rockets coach Tom Nissalke&#x27;s use of small forward Rick Barry as originating the point forward position.
== History ==

Historically, one of the first to fill the role was John Johnson, who played it for the 1970s Seattle SuperSonics alongside two scoring-minded guards, Gus Williams and Dennis Johnson. Also, starting with the 1973-74 season, the Golden State Warriors used 6&#x27;8&quot; Rick Barry quite often to facilitate the offense alongside such guards as Butch Beard, Jeff Mullins and Phil Smith. During the 1980s Milwaukee Bucks Marques Johnson and Paul Pressey played point forward under coach Don Nelson. Larry Bird, a 6&#x27;9&quot; small forward who excelled at both scoring and rebounding in that position was also an exceptional passer and facilitator of others on offense. In the flow of games, he often played a point forward role for the great Boston Celtics teams of the 1980s; the 6&#x27;9&quot; Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson, who orchestrated the Los Angeles Lakers&#x27; offense in the 1980s as the team&#x27;s point guard, moved to a point forward role upon returning heavier after his HIV announcement.

Scottie Pippen who played with Michael Jordan on the Chicago Bulls is one further example of a modern point-forward. He was the team&#x27;s small forward, but he played point-guard in high school and brought the ball up the floor against the press in college. On the day he was drafted, Pippen can be quoted during his interview &quot;Going in, I&#x27;m looking to play probably the 3 position but some day I&#x27;m looking to work my way in to the point guard position&quot;. Bulls teammate Dennis Rodman noted &quot;Pippen is most probably the innovator of the power/point forward position.&quot; Pippen could also defend point guards.

The radio broadcast &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; began in 2004 and was syndicated by the now defunct Air America Radio until January 2010. Papantonio was also involved at Air America as a member of the Board of Directors, and as a co-contributor to the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, &quot;Air America, the Playbook&quot;, a collection of essays, transcripts, and interviews by network personalities released in the run-up to the 2006 congressional elections. Papantonio has appeared regularly as a contributor on Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN.

His role on &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; was featured in the 2006 documentary &quot;Jesus Camp&quot;, in which he offers commentary on many of the scenes depicted. According to DVD commentary by the film&#x27;s directors, Papantonio was added to the film later on because they felt there wasn&#x27;t any &quot;tension&quot; in it, and they wanted another viewpoint. 

On the weekly show &quot;America&#x27;s Lawyer&quot;, Papantonio, a Methodist, often criticizes the Christian right. He has said that &quot;I come from a pretty strong spiritual center, but it doesn&#x27;t change the way I judge people. Simply put, the Sermon on the Mount makes much more sense to me than the frenzied rantings of America&#x27;s new &#x27;religious right&#x27;. They have become an element of American politics that threatens our sense of decency as well as our democracy.&quot; Papantonio has called Republican politicians &quot;an entire collection of ass clowns.&quot;

==Controversies==
In March 2024, Papantonio, who is an organizer and founder of the conference Mass Torts Made Perfect, walked back on decision to invite actor Mark Ruffalo as a speaker due to the fact that at the 96th Academy Awards Ruffalo expressed support for ceasefire after Israel&#x27;s invasion of the Gaza a few months earlier.

==Awards==
* In 2011, Papantonio was awarded the Perry Nichols Award, the highest honor given by the Florida Justice Association, a lobbying organization for plaintiff lawyers.
* In 2014, the Stephen and Sandra Sheller Center for Social Justice of Temple University Beasley School of Law honored Papantonio for his outstanding contributions to social justice.
* In 2015, Papantonio was inducted into the Trial Lawyer Hall of Fame.

<text>Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin (; – June 7, 1935) was a Russian practitioner of selection to produce new types of crop plants, Honorable Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and academician of the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agriculture.

Throughout all his life, Michurin worked to create new sorts of fruit plants. He introduced over 300 new varieties. He was awarded the Order of Lenin and Order of the Red Banner of Labour for his achievements. The town of Michurinsk is named in his honor, as was the Bulgarian town of Tsarevo between 1950 and 1991.

==Life and work==
In 1875, Michurin leased a strip of land of about 500 square metres not far from Tambov, began collecting plants, and started his research in pomology and selection. In 1899, he acquired a much bigger strip of land of about 130,000 square metres and moved all of his plants there.

In 1920, right after the end of the Russian Civil War, Vladimir Lenin ordered People&#x27;s Commissar of Agriculture Semyon Sereda to organize an analytic research project on Michurin&#x27;s works and practical achievements. On September 11, 1922, Mikhail Kalinin visited Michurin at Lenin&#x27;s personal request. On November 20, 1923, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars recognized Michurin&#x27;s &quot;fruit garden&quot; as an institution of state importance. In 1928, the Soviets established a selectionist genetic station on the basis of Michurin&#x27;s garden, which would be re-organized into the Michurin Central Genetic Laboratory in 1934.

Michurin made a major contribution in the development of genetics, especially in the field of pomology. In his cytogenetic laboratory, he researched cell structure and experimented with artificial polyploidy. Michurin studied the aspects of heredity in connection with the natural course of ontogenesis and external influence, creating a whole new concept of predominance. He proved that predominance depends on heredity, ontogenesis, and phylogenesis of the initial cell structure and also on individual features of hybrids and conditions of cultivation. In his works, Michurin assumed a possibility of changing genotype under external influence.

Michurin was one of the founding fathers of scientific agricultural selection. He worked on hybridization of plants of similar and different origins, cultivating methods in connection with the natural course of ontogenesis, directing the process of predominance, evaluation and selection of seedlings, and acceleration of the process of selection with the help of physical and chemical factors.

Michurin&#x27;s method of crossing of geographically distant plants would be widely used by other selectionists. He worked out theoretical basis and some practical means for hybridization of geographically distant plants. Michurin also proposed means for overcoming the genetic barrier of incompatibility during the process of hybridization, such as pollination of the young hybrids during their first florescence, preliminary vegetative crossing, and use of a “mediator”, pollination with the mix of different kinds of pollen.

The Soviets began to cultivate Michurin&#x27;s hybrids of apple, pear, cherry, rowan and others. The variety Antonovka is the most famous apple he developed. It is so popular in Russia that it was given the name The People&#x27;s Apple. It is widely used in Russia and Poland for fresh eating and culinary purposes. In other parts of Europe and North America, it is principally used as a hardy rootstock. Michurin also cultivated hybrids of grape, apricot, sweet cherry and other southern plants in the northern climates.

<doc id="986618" wikidata="Q2318277" url="?curid=986618" title="Homer the Great">
<text>&quot;Homer the Great&quot; is the twelfth episode of the sixth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on January 8, 1995. In the episode, Homer joins an ancient secret society known as the Stonecutters.

The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jim Reardon. Patrick Stewart guest-stars as &quot;Number One&quot;, the leader of the Springfield chapter of the Stonecutters. It features cultural references to Freemasonry and the films &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;.

The episode has received universal acclaim from fans and television critics and has been called one of the best episodes of the series by Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood in their book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;.

The song &quot;We Do&quot; was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics.

==Plot==
After Homer notices that his coworkers Lenny and Carl enjoy special privileges at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, such as better chairs and better parking, he learns they are part of an ancient secret society known as the Stonecutters. To join, one must either be the son of a Stonecutter or save the life of a Stonecutter. While extolling the secret society at the dinner table, Homer discovers that his father is a member and is admitted.

After his initiation, Homer takes great pleasure in the society&#x27;s secret privileges, such as better service, better chairs and a secret road that helps to avoid traffic. He still does not receive better parking, but is given rollerskates to get to work faster. During a celebratory dinner with his fellow Stonecutters, he unwittingly destroys their Hallowed Sacred Parchment. He is stripped of his Stonecutter robes and sentenced to walk home naked. Before he leaves, the Stonecutters see that Homer has a birthmark in the shape of their emblem, signifying he is the Chosen One who will lead them to greatness, as prophesied by the Hallowed Sacred Parchment.

Homer is crowned the new leader of the Stonecutters. While initially enjoying the power he receives, he soon feels isolated by his power when the other members treat him differently because he is their leader. When Homer asks Lisa for advice, she suggests that he have the Stonecutters perform volunteer work for the community. The Stonecutters mistake this for going mad with power and form a new society; the Ancient Mystic Society of No Homers.

Homer becomes despondent about losing his secret club. Marge consoles him by telling him he is a member of a very selective club: the Simpson family. To initiate Homer, Bart and Lisa paddle his butt.

==Production==

Although &quot;Homer the Great&quot; was written by John Swartzwelder, the story was suggested by executive producer David Mirkin. Mirkin did not have enough time to write the episode and asked Swartzwelder to do it. Mirkin came up with the idea while driving home from a rewrite early in the morning and listened to a religious radio station where they were talking about Freemasonry. Mirkin decided it would make a great episode, where many people in Springfield were members of a Masonic society and Homer was left on the outside and felt neglected.

The song &quot;We Do&quot; was not included in the original script and was suggested by Matt Groening. It was written by the writers&#x27; room, who threw in as many things that annoyed them as they possibly could. It was described as &quot;one of the series&#x27; best musical numbers&quot; by Colin Jacobson at &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot;, and was later included in the clip show &quot;All Singing, All Dancing&quot;.

The episode guest stars Patrick Stewart as Number One. He later said, &quot;I think my appearance in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and an appearance that I did on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;—in praise of the letter B—were perhaps the two most distinguished bits of work that I&#x27;ve done in the US.&quot; Mirkin stated that Stewart&#x27;s appearance is &quot;one of the best guest performances&quot; because &quot;he was so committed to [the] character&quot;.

==Cultural references==
The term &quot;Stonecutters&quot; and the organization&#x27;s symbol are references to Freemasonry. The Stonecutters are in possession of the Ark of the Covenant and when they burn Homer&#x27;s underwear in it, spirits escape, a reference to &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). When crowned &quot;The Chosen One&quot;, Homer, dressed in finery, enters through some curtains, a reference to &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987).

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;Homer the Great&quot; finished 1st in the ratings for the week of January 2 to January 8, 1995. The episode was the highest rated show on the Fox network that week.

Since airing, the episode has received universal acclaim from fans and television critics and is often cited as one of the best episodes of the show.

The authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it &quot;a brilliant crack at freemasonry, with all the secret signs, one-upmanship, rituals and unusual membership rules. Add to this Patrick Stewart&#x27;s amazing voice and you have one of the better episodes of the series.&quot;

TV Squad&#x27;s Adam Finley said the episode &quot;does a great job of satirizing Freemasons&quot;. Colin Jacobson at &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; said in a review of the sixth season DVD: &quot;I think it peters out a bit as it progresses; the best moments show the influence of the Stonecutters, and the show drags a little toward the end. Nonetheless, it still offers a solid piece of work.&quot;

Patrick Enwright of &quot;Today&quot; listed &quot;Homer the Great&quot; as his third favorite episode, saying, &quot;as a whole [it] is (almost) unsurpassable&quot;. Dave Petruska of the &quot;Tucson Citizen&quot; named it his favorite episode &quot;because it is such a wonderful satire on fraternal organizations and because of Patrick Stewart&#x27;s hilarious guest-starring role as &#x27;Number One&#x27;.&quot; In 2010, Michael Moran of &quot;The Times&quot; ranked it the fifth best in the show&#x27;s history.

&quot;Total Film&quot;″s Nathan Ditum ranked Stewart&#x27;s performance as the ninth best guest appearance in the show&#x27;s history.

John Swartzwelder and Alf Clausen were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for the song &quot;We Do&quot;. It was featured on the album &quot;Songs in the Key of Springfield&quot;.

<text>Joy Ann Smith (born February 20, 1947) is a Canadian politician. She served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba between 1999 and 2003, and was in the House of Commons of Canada from 2004 to 2015.

==Education and business career==
Smith was born in Deloraine, Manitoba, Canada. She holds a Master&#x27;s Degree in Education from the University of Manitoba (majoring in Math and Science), and a music diploma from the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Ontario. She worked as a teacher for twenty-three years before entering political life, and in 1986 received the &quot;Hedley Award for Excellence in Research&quot;. During the 1990s, she served as a liaison for private and home-schooling groups.

Smith is also an entrepreneur. She published a book entitled &quot;Lies My Kid&#x27;s Teacher Told Me&quot; in 1996, and a follow-up entitled, &quot;Tools of the Trade&quot; a few years later. She was also the owner of Gem Records for a time. In 1996, she was nominated for Manitoba&#x27;s &quot;Woman Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; award.

==Career in provincial politics==
Smith was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1999 provincial election, as a Progressive Conservative (PC) candidate in the south-central Winnipeg constituency of Fort Garry. She was nominated after the incumbent member of the assembly, cabinet minister Rosemary Vodrey, chose not to run again. In one of the closest constituency races of the campaign, Smith narrowly defeated New Democrat Lawrie Cherniack by thirty votes. The New Democratic Party replaced the Conservatives&#x27; majority government with one of their own at the election, and Smith served as the Progressive Conservative critic for education and justice.

In 2002, as justice critic for the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives, she spoke against a bill which provided adoption rights to same-sex couples in that province. Smith argued that her party did not oppose same-sex adoption rights as such, but that the proposed legislation was flawed.

Fort Garry was a top NDP target in the 2003 election, and Smith lost the constituency to New Democrat Kerri Irvin-Ross by eighty-seven votes.

==Career in federal politics==
In a June 2005 parliamentary debate on same-sex marriage, she stated that, &quot;If (her daughter) decides to get married, she will know that the meaning of marriage is the union of a man and a woman. If she chooses otherwise, it will be her choice.&quot; The result of the bill, she said, would be to &quot;cause marriage to just go away with the stroke of a pen.&quot; She also claimed the bill was discriminatory against married couples. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that Smith broke down in tears during the debate.

She was also a member of the Status of Women Group, Ukrainian-Canadian Parliamentary Group, Canada-Israel Parliamentary Group and Canada-USA Relations Parliamentary Group. In 2004, Smith was selected to be part of the Canadian delegation assigned to travel to Ukraine and observe a court-ordered repeat of the second round of voting the presidential election.

In the 2004 federal election, Smith campaigned as a Conservative candidate in the north Winnipeg riding of Kildonan—St. Paul. She had previously been nominated as a candidate of the Canadian Alliance, where she was the Manitoba organizer for Stockwell Day&#x27;s bid for leadership, before that party merged with the Progressive Conservatives in 2003–04. Smith narrowly defeated Liberal candidate Terry Duguid, 13,582 votes to 13,304. Smith was named Manitoba caucus chair, giving her a seat on the Conservative Party&#x27;s Planning and Priorities Committee.

Smith defeated Duguid again by a significantly larger plurality in the 2006 federal election, as the Conservatives won a national minority government, replacing the Liberals as such. Smith along with the Conservative government were re-elected in the October 2008 federal election to another minority government. In 2006, Smith introduced a private member&#x27;s bill, asking parliamentarians to condemn human trafficking and come up with a comprehensive plan to combat the problem.

In February 2007, Smith put forward motion C-153 to put a national action plan in place to combat human trafficking, and the House of Commons passed the motion unanimously. Smith began developing the plan in 2008 and continued to work on it for several years. She sought to have the plan developed and established in order &quot;to rescue and restore the victims and prosecute the offenders&quot; of human trafficking. The plan was established by the Government of Canada on June 6, 2012 as the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking.

Also in 2007, Smith introduced a private member&#x27;s bill called the &quot;Clean Internet Act&quot; (Bill C-427). The bill was passed unanimously, and set in place a strategy to combat human trafficking globally by opposing such trafficking across international borders, specifically in the case of women and children being trafficked for sexual purposes. In her words, the bill would &quot;... prevent the use of the Internet to distribute child pornography, material that advocates, promotes or incites racial hatred, and material that portrays or promotes violence against women.&quot; Part of the bill proposes a &quot;know your subscriber&quot; requirement for ISPs and would mandate them to deny Internet access to offenders. It also proposes to give special searching powers to the Ministry of Industry. The above features have led it to be criticized as something that &quot;... would not look out-of-place in countries that aggressively censor the Internet.&quot;

In her column, &quot;Sex traders, keep your hands off our children!&quot; (&quot;The Province&quot;, July 29), Smith asserted that &quot;the average age of entry into prostitution in Canada is between 12 and 14 years of age.&quot; In October 2010, Smith conducted the inaugural Honouring Heroes Award Ceremony at Eastview Community Church, an annual event recognizing people who have fought to support victims of sexual trafficking.

In 2012, Smith presented human-trafficking-related Bill C-10 to the Senate of Canada. The bill was eventually passed as the Safe Streets and Communities Act, a policy of the Canadian government. While Smith was in Ottawa to present Bill C-10, she was also scheduled to speak on the talkback panel in conjunction with the human-trafficking-related play &quot;She Has a Name&quot;.

Smith proposed and claimed to be working on, in July 2013, a bill that disallows access to pornography online for all Canadians by default unless they choose to opt in, similar to earlier legislation put forward in the U.K. by British Prime Minister David Cameron. Details of what content specifically would be deemed &quot;pornographic&quot; and blocked were not provided.

She did not run for re-election in 2015.

==Out of politics==
In 2012, while in political office, Joy founded The Joy Smith Foundation Inc., a registered charity that works to suppress human trafficking in Canada. After retiring from politics, Joy began working full-time for her organization.

<text>George &quot;Professor&quot; Burchett (23 August 1872 – 3 April 1953) was an English tattoo artist known as the &quot;King of Tattooists&quot;.

==Profile==
Burchett was born George Burchett-Davis on 23 August 1872 in the English seaside town of Brighton, East Sussex. He was expelled from school at age 12 for tattooing his classmates. He joined the Royal Navy at age 13 (see boy seaman). He developed his tattooing skills while travelling overseas as a deckhand on . After absconding from the Navy, he returned to England.

In 1900, Burchett became a full-time tattoo artist. With studios on Mile End Road and at 72 Waterloo Road, London, Burchett became the first star tattooist and a favourite among the wealthy upper class and European royalty. Among his customers were King Alfonso XIII of Spain, King Frederik IX of Denmark, and performer Horace &quot;The Great Omi&quot; Ridler. Though it was reputed that he tattooed the &quot;Sailor King&quot; George V of the United Kingdom, there is no reliable evidence to attest to this actually being the case.

He constantly designed new tattoos from his worldwide travel, incorporating African, Japanese and Southeast Asian motifs into his work. In the 1930s, he developed cosmetic tattooing with such techniques as permanently darkening eyebrows.

He continued tattooing until his sudden death on Good Friday in 1953 at the age of 80. A purported autobiography, &quot;Memoirs of a Tattooist&quot;, edited by Peter Leighton (a pseudonym of writer Edward Spiro, also known as EH Cookridge), was published in 1958 by Oldbourne Book Company, five years after Burchett&#x27;s death. This work included photographs illustrating some of Burchett&#x27;s tattoo designs. Recent research has revealed that, despite the claims made in the foreword, the text was not actually compiled and edited from Burchett&#x27;s own notes, but cribbed quickly from newspaper articles made shortly after Burchett&#x27;s death.

<doc id="986625" wikidata="Q422172" url="?curid=986625" title="Total shareholder return">
<text>Total shareholder return (TSR) (or simply total return) is a measure of the performance of different companies&#x27; stocks and shares over time. It combines share price appreciation and dividends paid to show the total return to the shareholder expressed as an annualized percentage. It is calculated by the growth in capital from purchasing a share in the company assuming that the dividends are reinvested each time they are paid. This growth is expressed as a percentage as the compound annual growth rate.

The main benefit of TSR is that it allows the performance of shares to be compared even though some of the shares may have a high growth and low dividends and others may have low growth and high dividends.

Most stock market indices only use the growth of the prices of the companies making up the index. However, when they use TSR for the companies it is called a total return index or accumulation index. For example, corresponding to the S&amp;P 500 index calculated by Standard and Poor&#x27;s, there is the S&amp;P 500 TR index.

In the technology sector, a study has found that regardless of a company&#x27;s size, the more diverse the portfolio, the more difficult it is to generate high TSR.

In practice TSR is difficult to calculate since it involves knowing the price of the shares at the time the dividends are paid. However, as an approximation over one year it can be calculated as follows with:
formula_1 = share price at beginning of year,
formula_2 = share price at end of year,
&quot;Dividends&quot; = dividends paid over year and

&quot;TSR&quot; = total shareholder return, TSR is computed as

formula_3

<doc id="986627" wikidata="Q7452460" url="?curid=986627" title="Sequence breaking">
<text>In computer and video games, sequence breaking is the act of performing actions or obtaining items out of the intended linear order or of skipping &quot;required&quot; actions or items entirely. Sequence breaking is often used to beat a game unusually quickly (see speedrunning), to beat it while only completing a few objectives or obtaining a few items, to obtain useful items early in the game, to make the game more difficult, or to help push a game as far as possible in some other way.

==History of the term==
Though sequence breaking as a concept has existed almost since the inception of computer games complex enough to have sequential storylines, the first documented action in a video game to be &quot;called&quot; a sequence break occurred in the Nintendo GameCube game &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, in a thread called &quot;Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus&quot;. In the game, the rock monster Thardus was designed to be a required boss before the Gravity Suit and the Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items and thus saving time if the goal is to complete the game as quickly as possible. When Steven Banks achieved this feat on January 18, 2003, he posted his discovery on the &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; message board on GameFAQs. The thread attracted a number of interested gamers, and the term sequence breaking was incidentally coined. The term has since grown in popularity and is now sometimes applied to unintended shortcuts in any game.

The term has become so pervasive that it has begun appearing in video games itself, and, inspired by games such as &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, game designers may create their games with sequence breaking in mind.

<doc id="986647" wikidata="Q183146" url="?curid=986647" title="Sukhoi Su-17">
<text>The Sukhoi Su-17 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; S-32; NATO reporting name: Fitter) is a variable-sweep wing fighter-bomber developed for the Soviet military. Developed from the Sukhoi Su-7, the Su-17 was the first variable-sweep wing aircraft to enter Soviet service and featured updated avionics. The aircraft also has variants which were designed to be exported to non-Soviet states such as the Sukhoi Su-22 and the less popular Su-20.

It was produced from 1967 to 1990. The Su-17/20/22 series had a long career and has been operated by many air forces, including those of the Russian Federation, former Soviet republics, former Warsaw Pact, countries in the Arab world, Angola, and Peru. The Russian Federation retired its fleet in 1998.

Although the Su-17 was capable of carrying nuclear weapons, it was used in roles ranging from close-air support to ground attack.

==Development==
Shortly after the Su-7 fighter-bomber was put into service, the Sukhoi Design Bureau was ordered to develop a modernization program. The program would be aimed primarily at updating on-board avionics and takeoff/landing characteristics. The concept of variable-geometry wings - something gaining wider attention at that time - was adopted. The program was to be led by Sukhoi&#x27;s head designer, Nikolay Zyrin.

In 1963, the Sukhoi OKB with input from TsAGI created a variable-sweep wing technology demonstrator. The S-22I (also known as the Su-7IG, NATO designation &quot;Fitter-B&quot;), converted from a production Su-7BM, had fixed inner portions of the wing with movable outer segments that could be swept to 28°, 45°, or 62°. The S-22I first took off (with Vladimir Ilyushin at the controls) on 2 August 1966. It was later demonstrated at the air parade in Domodedovo in July 1967.

Flight testing revealed that the configuration improved both take-off/landing characteristics, range and endurance. Handling was generally better than the fixed wing Su-7, with the exception that buffeting at high angles of attack to warn of imminent stall no longer occurred.

The aircraft was sent into serial production in 1969 by a joint resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers. The design of the Su-7IG was modified further, eventually with enough difference to justify the S-32 internal designation. The S-32 first took off on July 1, 1969, with Yevgeny Kukushev at the controls.

Serial production started at Yuri Gagarin Aviation Factory (now KnAAPO) in 1969. The 523rd Aviation Regiment, of the Far East Military Okrug, was the first to receive the Su-17. The Su-17 was produced until 1990, producing 2867 units.

The Su-17 resembles its predecessor, the Su-7, with weight-saving measures added at the cost of combat survivability, an example of which is the removal of pilot protection armor.

The prototype S-22I differed little from the Su-7 except for the wing, essentially a technology demonstrator for the variable-geometry wing. It was later lost in an accident.

Following the S-22I, two pre-production prototypes were constructed, designated S32-1 and the S32-2. The two aircraft mounted updated avionics, and replaced the older AP-28I-2 autopilot with the newer SAU-22 automatic control system.

The next series of prototypes were the Su-7-85, with 85 indicating the batch number. The batch of ten aircraft incorporated a redesigned fuselage, a streamlined cockpit (similar to the Su-7U), extra, more accessible maintenance hatches, and an upward-opening canopy. The front of the cockpit was protected with a windshield and two electrically heated side windows. The first three aircraft of the 86th batch incorporated clear windshields with warm air blown at them, taken from the 9th stage of the engine compressor. However, this windshield was dropped in favor of the more traditional glazed windshield following tests by the 4th Combat Use and Retraining of Air Force Personnel Center in Lipetsk.

The Su-7-85 was equipped with a modified KS4-S32 ejection seat, capable of safely ejecting the pilot at speeds above 140–170 km/h.

The fuel system was modified from the Su-7, as well; fuel was stored in three lightweight tanks, with provisions for up to four disposable auxiliary tanks each with 600 litres of capacity (itself used on the Su-7B), or two PTB-1150 tanks with 1150 litres each, mounted on &quot;wet&quot; pylons under the fuselage.

The wing was largely unmodified from the S-22I. The stationary part of the wing was half as long as the rotating part. With wings at maximum sweep, the Su-17 would look virtually identical to the Su-7. A slide-out flap was installed on the stationary part of the wing, while a slat, a rotating flap and aileron were mounted on the rotating part. The sweep angle could be configured between 30° and 63°. The horizontal and vertical tails were swept at 55°.

Flight control was assisted by non-reversing hydraulic boosters, the BU-220DL2 and -220DP2 for the left and right ailerons, the BU-250L and -250P for the stabilizers and the BU-250DRP for the rudder. The flight control systems were spring-loaded to provide feedback on the stick and the rudder pedals.

Three independent hydraulic systems are installed on the Su-17—an actuating system and two booster systems, each with a hydraulic pump. The actuating hydraulic system was responsible for adjusting the sweep angle of the wing, deploying/retracting the landing gear, the flaps and slats, adjusting the intake ramps, the flight control mechanisms used by the SAU-22 autopilot, and the steering front wheel. The booster systems control the flight surfaces. The systems operate in parallel to ensure safe operation in the event of a failure. The remaining operational system would provide power to the flight surfaces, albeit at half the power. The Nr 1 booster system feeds the GM-40 hydraulic motor driving the rotary parts of the wing. All hydraulic systems are fed with the AMG-10 hydraulic fluid, with a standard operating pressure of 215 kgf/cm2 for the booster systems and 210 for the actuating system.

A pneumatic system with a 150kgf/cm2 pressure operates the normal and emergency brakes on the landing gear as well as the emergency landing gear/flaps deployment system, and was responsible for charging the two NR-30 cannons mounted on the aircraft, pressurizing the cockpit, opening/closing the canopy and pressurizing the hydraulic fluid tanks.

The Su-17 was powered by a modified Lyulka AL-7F1-250 with a slightly uprated thrust of 9600 kgf on afterburners. It was equipped with a compressor actuator with redundancy, and a system for intake adjustment. The aircraft would need to be disassembled into two halves to replace its engine. Jettisonable SPRD-110 RATO boosters are available to facilitate take-off on short runways, providing a momentary thrust of up to 3000 kgf.

On-board electronics are fed by a 28V DC circuit and a 115V, 400 Hz single-phase AC circuit, fed by two GS-12T DC generators, an SGO-8TF AC generator and a 20NKBN25 nickel–cadmium battery.

The Su-17 has the ability to carry free-fall nuclear bombs with a BDZ-56FNM bomb rack. A special code device would be installed in the cockpit, mandating a correct code input before the bomb could be armed and released, to prevent unauthorized uses of nuclear weaponry. The aircraft also has a toss bombing capability for nuclear weapon delivery, with which it could approach the target, initiate a steep climb and release the bomb when pointing almost upright, and then activate afterburners to escape the blast radius. A special IAB-500 bomb was made specifically for practicing such a bombing technique.

==Operational history==

===Soviet Union/Russia===

The Su-17 was used during the Soviet-Afghan war during Operation South and launched air strikes a mujahideen base at Robat Jaali near the Iranian Afghan border.

The Su-17M3/4 were used during the First Chechen War alongside Sukhoi Su-24s and Sukhoi Su-25s in ground attack and reconnaissance missions.

In a move to eliminate single-engine strike aircraft from its inventory, the Russian Air Force retired its last Su-17M4 along with its fleet of MiG-23/27s in 1998.

===Angola===
The Soviets supplied the communist government of Angola with 12 Su-20Ms in 1982 or 1983, which formed the basis of the 15th FS. The squadron suffered a swift loss of at least six aircraft – most in mishaps – by 1985, and three more by 1988, and had only two aircraft left when it was reinforced with batch of 14 Su-22M-4Ks and two Su-22UM-3Ks in 1989–90 (incorporated into the 26th Air Regiment, based in Moçâmedes).

===Iraq===

From 22 September 1980 to 20 August 1988, during the Iran–Iraq War, Iraq used Su-17 export versions (Su-20 and Su-22) alongside older Su-7s. They were mostly used in ground-attack and close air support roles. Iranian Grumman F-14 Tomcats shot down 21 Su-20/-22s, that have been confirmed by western sources. Eighteen Su-20/-22s were also shot down by Iranian McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs. and three by Iranian Northrop F-5s. On 20 October 1980 an Iraqi Su-20 shot down an Iranian F-4E with its 30 mm cannons.

Official Iraqi accounts show no loss of Su-20 aircraft throughout the war against the Kurds and Iran. Twenty Su-22M2s, two Su-22M3s and seven Su-22M4s were lost during the war with Iran, the majority to anti-aircraft fire sustained during low-level bombing raids against Iranian front lines.

In 1991, during the Gulf War, Iraqi Su-22s saw limited active service because the Iraqi regime distrusted the Iraqi Air Force (IQAF). On 7 February 1991, two Su-20/22s and one Su-7 were shot down by United States Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles using AIM-7 air-to-air missiles when the IQAF was moving its aircraft to Iran.

On 20 and 22 March 1991, two other Su-22s were downed by USAF F-15s in an attempt to protect Kurdish civilians before the start of Operation Provide Comfort to provide humanitarian aid and the establishment of a no-fly zone north of 36th parallel.

===Libya===

Two Libyan Su-22s were shot down in the Gulf of Sidra incident by United States Navy Grumman F-14 Tomcats on 19 August 1981. One Su-22 launched a K-13 missile head-on at one of the F-14s from an estimated 300-meter (984-foot) closing distance, however the missile was evaded. Both were then downed by AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles.

On 8 October 1987, in the aftermath of the Chadian–Libyan conflict, an Su-22 was shot down by a FIM-92A Stinger launched by Chadian forces. The pilot, Capt. Diya al-Din, ejected and was captured. He was later granted political asylum by the French government. During the recovery operation, a Libyan Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23MS was shot down by a Stinger.

A Libyan Su-22 crashed near Benghazi on 23 February 2011. The crew members, Captain Attia Abdel Salem al Abdali and his copilot, Ali Omar Gaddafi, were ordered to bomb the city in response to the Libyan Civil War. They refused, bailing out of the aircraft. Su-22s were heavily used by Libyan loyalist forces against insurgent forces from mid-February to mid-March 2011, when the international mission started and the no fly zone was imposed. Among other missions, Su-22s attacked Anti-Gaddafi positions in Bin Jawad in early March 2011 as government forces retook the town.

One Libyan Air Force Su-22 was destroyed on the ground by a Belgian Air Force F-16AM on 27 March.

===Peru===

Peru was the only export customer of the type in the Americas.

On 24 April 1992, in a context of diplomatic and political tensions between Peru and the US after the autocoup orchestrated by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori 19 days before, Peruvian Su-22s attacked a Lockheed C-130H Hercules of the United States Air Force&#x27;s 310th Airlift Squadron which was intercepted at sea, northwest of Lima, injuring six of the 14 crew members. Master Sergeant Joseph C. Beard Jr. was killed when he was sucked from the cabin at 18,500 feet, and crew member Ronald Hetzel sustained severe injuries.

The Hercules&#x27; pilot barely managed to land the crippled plane, with one engine damaged and three blown landing tires, at a Peruvian Air Force base near the city of Talara, where the crew was detained, and the bullet-ridden plane impounded, before being freed after US government pressure. The incident caused an almost year-long interruption to the US anti-drug Air Bridge Denial Program and the establishment of a Joint Air Operation Center at Howard Air Force Base in Panama, from where the C-130 had been operating.

During the brief 1995 Cenepa War between Peru and Ecuador, two Peruvian Sukhoi Su-22s were lost, on 10 February when two Ecuadorian Air Force Mirage F1JAs, piloted by Maj. R. Banderas and Capt. C. Uzcátegui, were directed over five targets approaching the disputed Cenepa valley. After making visual contact, the Mirages launched their missiles, however the Ecuadorian Air Force never showed the HUD videos of the fighters confirming the shootdowns, claiming two Peruvian Su-22As shot down, while a Kfir claimed a further Cessna A-37 Dragonfly. Peru, however, denied that the two Su-22As were shot down by Mirages, stating that one was struck by Ecuadorian anti-aircraft artillery during a low flying ground-attack mission and the second crashed because of an engine fire.

The Su-22s flew 45 sorties into the combat zone. A 20-strong force of Su-22s was established at El Pato as a retaliatory force should Ecuador decide to attack the coastal port.

===Poland===

On 19 August 2003, a Polish Air Force Su-22M4K was accidentally shot down by friendly fire during an exercise by a Polish 2K12 Kub missile battery. The aircraft was flying 21 km from the coast over the Baltic Sea near Ustka. The pilot ejected and was rescued after two hours in the water. In 2012, Poland was investigating the replacement of its Su-22s with three squadrons of unmanned aerial vehicles.

As of 2014 the Polish Air Force was planning to retain the Su-22s in service. The decision was hoped to have a positive impact on Polish industry, as the WZL nr 2 repair facility in Bydgoszcz would maintain the remaining aircraft under contract to the Air Force. The decision would also allow the Air Force to retain the well-trained ground crews and pilots operating the aircraft. The Poles consider the Su-22 easier to maintain and repair than the other main combat aircraft types currently in Polish service (mainly the MiG-29 and the F-16). They suffer from fewer malfunctions and other problems (high, 70–75% non-error index). It is the only aircraft in Polish inventory equipped for electronic intelligence, warfare, and support of ground systems. The Polish Air Force retained a large stockpile of air-to-ground weapons for use with the Su-22. By some estimates, the cost of destroying these resources would be higher than the projected cost of continuing Su-22 operations.

It was decided that starting from 2015, only 12 Su-22M4s and 4-6 Su-22UM3Ks out of 32 remaining would undergo a refit, extending their lifespan by ten years. For economic reasons the aircraft are not modernized, apart from fitting an additional RS-6113-2 C2M radio with a blade antenna on the top, but they received a grey multishade camouflage, similar to other Polish aircraft. Several Polish Su-20s and Su-22s were donated to various museums, including the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw, the Armament Museum in Poznań, the Museum of Polish Arms in Kołobrzeg and the Polish Aviation Museum in Kraków. Other were placed on monuments or donated to schools as technical aids.

Following the acquisition of 48 KAI T-50 Golden Eagle aircraft from South Korea in 2022, the Su-22 fleet was to be retired.

===Syria===

The Syrian Air Force (SyAAF) used Su-20/-22s to attack Israeli forces in the Yom Kippur War and 1982 Lebanon War. Several Su-20/-22s were shot down by the Israeli Air Force. From mid-2012, in the Syrian Civil War, Syrian Air Force Su-22s were involved in combat operations against Syrian insurgents. Videos showed Su-22s using unguided munitions like other SyAAF fixed-wing aircraft; mostly general-purpose bombs, cluster bombs and incendiary bombs and unguided rockets. Attack tactics were low to medium-altitude flat bombing runs with pull up after rocketing or bombing, deploying decoy flares for self-defense. As of the end of 2015, the SyAAF Su-22s suffered fewer losses compared to the SyAAF MiG-21 and MiG-23. The first confirmed loss of an SyAAF Su-22 was recorded on 14 February 2013, when rebel forces shot it down using MANPAD. On 18 June 2017, a US F/A-18E Super Hornet engaged and shot down an SyAAF Su-22 for dropping munitions on US-backed forces. According to the wingman of the Super Hornet that made the kill, the Syrian pilot was able to eject and was later returned to the Syrian government. On 24 July 2018, an SyAAF Su-22 that entered Israeli airspace was shot down by two Israeli Patriot missiles. Other Syrian Su-22 jets were downed during the ongoing civil war.

===Yemen===
On 11 August 2009, Yemeni armed forces started Operation Scorched Earth in northern Yemen to fight Houthi rebels. The Yemeni Air Force backed the army with air raids on rebel positions. On 5 October 2009, a Yemeni Su-22 crashed, with the rebels claiming to have shot it down. Earlier on 2 October, the Yemeni revolutionaries said they shot down a &quot;MiG-21&quot; while the military insisted technical problems caused the crash.
On 8 November, a third Yemeni fighter aircraft, reported to be a Sukhoi, was destroyed. Again the military alleged technical problems, while the Yemeni rebels claimed they shot it down. The pilot ejected and was recovered by friendly forces. The Yemeni Air force used Sukhoi aircraft during the Arab Spring uprising. On 28 September 2011, a Yemeni Air Force Su-22 was shot down by tribesmen opposed to the rule of President Saleh. The government confirmed that rebels were responsible for the shoot-down, and that the pilot had been captured. On February 19, 2013, a Yemeni Su-22 on a training mission crashed for unknown reasons into Sana&#x27;a, killing 12 civilians. On May 13, 2013, another Yemen Su-22 on a training mission crashed in Sana&#x27;a, killing the pilot.

==Variants==

Multiple Su-17 variants were examined.

=== Su-7IG (S-22I, &quot;Fitter-B&quot;) ===
Su-7BM variable geometry wing demonstrator.

=== Su-17 (S-32, &quot;Fitter-C&quot;) ===
Fitter-C was the initial production version, with a dorsal spine similar to that of the Su-7U (carrying wiring and equipment). It was powered by the same Lyulka AL-7F-1 engine as the Su-7. It was manufactured between 1969 and 1973, with a total of 224 built.

=== Su-17M (S-32M, &quot;Fitter-C&quot;) ===
This version used the Lyulka AL-21F-3 engine, and an updated navigation and attack computer. The Su-7BMK&#x27;s SRD-5M ranging radar was retained. Twin pitot tubes, angle of attack vane, single brake parachute. The variable-position intake centerbody provided maximum speed of Mach 2.1. This version was first flown on 28 December 1971 by V. S. Soloviev. The export version was designated Su-20, and was first flown on 15 December 1972 by A. N. Isakov. The Su-17M was manufactured between 1972 and 1975, and entered service in 1973. The Su-20 was exported to Egypt, Poland, and Syria.
The Su-17M was fitted with a modified fuselage and wing-sweep mechanism (without driveshafts). The fuel system consisted of a central tank, three interconnected, pressurized follower tanks feeding the central tank, and two additional follower tanks in the fixed part of the wing. The Su-17M was fitted with the SPO-10 Sirena-ZM radar warning receiver and the ARK-15 Tobol radio compass.
:The combat payload for the Su-17M was increased to four tons with the addition of two extra fuselage hardpoints, providing a total of eight BDZ-57M or MT hardpoints for carrying free-fall bombs. MBDZ-U6-68 hardpoints are available for KMGU submunition containers, S-8 or S-25 rockets. The Su-17M could carry the Kh-28 anti-radiation missile, which, used in concert with the Metel-A ELINT pod enables the aircraft to engage radar-guided air defence systems.

=== Su-17M-28 ===
Testbed for Kh-28 (AS-9 Kyle) anti-radiation missile

=== Su-17MKG ===
Testbed for Kh-25 and Kh-29 missiles

=== Su-17R ===
Small number of Su-17M aircraft equipped to carry reconnaissance pods. Equivalent export version designated Su-20R.

=== Su-17M2 (S-32M2, &quot;Fitter-D&quot;) ===
The nose extended , with removed ranging radar and &#x27;drooping&#x27; to improve pilot visibility. It was equipped with the Fon-1400 laser rangefinder/marked-target seeker (LRMTS), ASP-17 and PBK-3-17s aiming avionics, RSBN-6S short-range navigation and instrument landing system. It featured an undernose fairing for a DISS-7 Doppler navigation radar. The Su-17M2 first flew on 20 December 1973 with V. S. Ilyushin at the controls. It was manufactured between 1974 and 1977, and it entered service in 1975.
GMRThe design of the Su-17M was further modified into what would become the Su-17M2, with three pre-production aircraft used as prototypes. The KN-23 navigation system taken from the MiG-23 was installed, with an IKV inertial attitude indicator, a DISS-7 Doppler velocity sensor, air signal systems, and a V-144 analog computer with its own input panel. With the RSBN-6S Romb-K navigation system and the SAU-22M autopilot, the KN-23 provided the capability of automatically navigating along a route defined by three turning points before heading for the target location. The V-144 stored four sets of coordinates for landing airfields, and made it possible for the aircraft to automatically approach the airfield for landing and descend to an altitude of 50–60 meters prior to manual landing. The SOD-57M transponder was replaced with the newer SO-69. During its service, the SRO-2M transponder was replaced with the newer Parol (Russian for &quot;Password&quot;) system. A Fon-1400 laser rangefinder was installed under the inlet cone. The Delta NG missile control system, designed to send command signals to the Kh-23 Grom missile, was integrated into a pod under the wing. The Su-17M2 was fitted with the ASP-17S gunsight and a PBK-3-17S bombsight. The fuel system received a nitrogen pressurizer with a 200 kg capacity increase. Starting from aircraft Nr 03909 a central fuel feed system was introduced with the installation of the ETsN-45 fuel pump. The Su-17M2 was capable of carrying the Kh-25 air-to-ground missile, fitted with the 24N1 laser seeker. This was first tested by retrofitted Su-7BMs and Su-17Ms, designated Su-17MKG. The Su-17M2 could carry two such missiles, one each under the wing, mounted on an APU-68U or UM rack. The missiles were guided using a Prozhektor-1 laser-designator pod. The Su-17M2 had an unofficial nickname, s borodoy, which means &quot;with a beard&quot; in Russian.

=== Su-17M2D ===
This model was a test-fit of the Tumansky/Khatchaturov R-29BS-300 engine (shared with some MiG-23s), with 112.7 kN (25,335 lbf) afterburning thrust, in a bulged rear fuselage. Due to lack of performance advantage and decreased range due to higher fuel consumption, this engine was for export only. This version first flew on 31 January 1975 with A. N. Isakov at the controls. The export variant was designated Su-22 (factory code S-32M2K, NATO &quot;Fitter-F&quot;). It was manufactured between 1977 and 1978.

=== Su-17UM (S-52U, &quot;Fitter-E&quot;) ===
This was the first two-seat trainer version, based on the Su-17M2. It featured a deeper fuselage with a windscreen moved forward. It was the same length as the Su-17M. The internal fuel capacity was reduced and the port cannon deleted, but the aircraft retained full avionics and armament. The Su-17UM first flew on 15 August 1975 with V. A. Krechetov at the controls. Test flights revealed longitudinal instability at high angles of attack which was remedied by enlarging the tail fin. The export version with the R-29 engine was designated Su-22U. The Su-17UM was manufactured between 1976 and 1978, and entered service in 1976.

=== Su-17M3 (S-52, &quot;Fitter-H&quot;) ===
The Su-17M3 and its export versions represented the most numerous variant, with almost 1,000 built. The M3 was based on the revised airframe of the Su-17UM, adding an avionics bay and an additional fuel tank in place of the rear cockpit. The internal fuel capacity grew to 4850 L (1,280 U.S. gal). The Doppler radar was moved internally, and the fairing was removed. The M3 was equipped with the Klen-P laser rangefinder/target designator. A launch rail for Vympel K-13 or Molniya R-60 air-to-air missiles was added between the two pylons on each wing. 
GMRThe Su-17M3 first flew on 30 June 1976 with V. A. Krechetov at the controls. Its export version with the R-29 engine and downgraded avionics (equivalent to those of the Su-17M2) was designated Su-22M (factory designation S-52K, NATO &quot;Fitter-J&quot;) and first flew on 24 May 1977 with E. S. Soloviev at the controls. An export version with Su-17M3 avionics was designated Su-22M3 (factory S-52MK). The Su-17 was manufactured from 1976 to 1981, and the Su-22M from 1978 to 1984. 
The Su-17M3 was planned at the same time as the UM trainer. Fuel capacity was increased by 260 kg. Starting from the 38th batch the tailfin was raised with a radiotransparent guide and a fin was added on the underside of the tail to improve high-speed stability. A new KN-23-1 navigation system, the SAU-22M1 autopilot and the RV-15 (A-031) radio altimeter were added. Some aircraft later received an RSDN-10 Skip-2 (A-720) long-range radio navigation system, with its antenna installed on the tailfin&#x27;s leading edge. The SARPP-12GM flight recorder was replaced with the Tester-UZ recorder, and the SPO-10 radar warning receiver was replaced with the SPO-15A (izdeliye L006L) Beryoza. A Klyon-PS combined laser rangefinder/designator was installed, alongside the ASP-17BTs sight. The Su-17M3 could carry an SPS-141 (or the 142–143) Siren or an SPS-141MVG &quot;Gvozdika&quot; ECM pod. Infrared countermeasures could be deployed via KDS-23 launchers. The BSPPU fire-control system was used, which would control SPPU-22-01 gun pods suspended on the wings to automatically stay on target up to a depression angle of 30°. Two additional hardpoints were placed under the fuselage, with S-52-8812-300 pylons, on which BDZ-57MT or MTA racks could hold APU-68UMs, which in turn could carry Kh-23M or Kh-25 missiles. These hardpoints would be capable of carrying the Kh-25ML or MR missiles, as well as the Kh-29L, mounted on an AKU-58 ejector rack. Some of the Su-17M3s were modified to the Su-17M3P standard, which would enable them to carry up to four Kh-27PS, two on the wings and two under the fuselage, or two Kh-58 anti-radiation missiles, which could be carried only on the fuselage pylons. A Vyuga-17 (L-086) target designator pod could be installed under the fuselage, with its receiver integrated into the nose. The BDZ-57MT racks could also hold ordinary ordnance, such as the UB-16, -32 or the B-13L rocket pods, free-fall bombs, KMGU submunition containers, and the SPPU-22-01 gun pods. In a somewhat unconventional manner, the S-52-8307-200 pylons could be mounted on the aircraft, on which the gun pods would be installed in a rearwards-facing manner, pointed downwards at 23°, and fired as the aircraft flew away from ground targets. The first Su-17M3s were unpainted with the silver color from the anodized duralumin. Later Su-17M3s, as well as all variants that followed, were painted with a green camouflage pattern on the top, and blue on the bottom. This camouflage pattern eventually found its way to all Su-17s in service, and the paint jobs were done at repair plants. The camouflage pattern - the locations of the paint dots - was not standardized, thus each aircraft had its own &quot;unique&quot; camouflage. The Su-17M3 would also have a trainer variant designated the Su-17UM3.

=== Su-17UM (S-52UM) ===
The initial trainer version with the same avionics suite as the Su-17M. The export version was designated Su-22UM3 with R-29 engine, and Su-22UM3K with the AL-21 engine. It was manufactured from 1978 to 1982.

=== Su-17UM3 (S-52UM3, &quot;Fitter-G&quot;) ===
This was a revised trainer with the same avionics suite as the Su-17M3. The Su-17UM3 first flew on 21 September 1978 with Yu. A. Yegorov at the controls. The export version was designated Su-22UM3 with R-29 engine, and Su-22UM3K with the AL-21 engine. It was manufactured between 1978 and 1982.
=== Su-17M4 (S-54, &quot;Fitter-K&quot;) ===
This was the final production version, with upgraded avionics, including RSDN navigation (similar to LORAN), beacon navigation, inertial navigation, radio compass, and SPO-15LE radar warning receiver. It featured additional fuselage inlets (including a ram-air inlet at the base of the fin) to improve engine cooling airflow, and a fixed air intake shock cone. Many aircraft were equipped for the use of video-guided missiles and BA-58 Vjuga pod for anti-radiation missiles. The Su-17M4 was equipped with the AL-21F-3 engine, and its export version was designated Su-22M4 (factory S-54K). The Su-17M4 first flew on 19 June 1980 with Yu. A. Yegorov at the controls. The Su-17M4 was manufactured from 1981 to 1988, and the Su-22M4 from 1983 to 1990.
GMRThe Su-17M4 differed from the Su-17M3 in the removal of the inlet cone control system, which restricted the maximum allowable flight speed to Mach 1.75. The inlet cone housed the more powerful Klyon-54 laser rangefinder. The avionics differed significantly from its predecessors - a new A-312 Radikal NP close- and A-720 Skip-2 long-range navigation systems, an ARK-22 radio compass, an MRP-66 radio beacon receiver, an RV-21 Impuls (A-035) radio altimeter, and the DISS-7 Doppler velocity sensor, air signal systems, the IKV-8 inertial attitude indicator inherited from the Su-17M2. The Vyuga target designator pod could be carried in a BA-58 pod under the fuselage, which would enable the use of the Kh-27PS and Kh-58U or E missiles. Some Su-17M4s were fitted with the IT-23M indicator, which would transmit video from the Tubus-2 seeker on the Kh-29T missile to facilitate target acquisition.

=== Su-17M5 (S-56) ===
This was a proposed upgraded variant with a new fixed wing based on the swing wing at 45 degrees sweep, new avionics, and an AL-31F turbofan. It was not built.

=== Su-20 ===

This was the initial export version of the Su-17M (S-32MK).

=== Su-22M5 ===
This was a Russian-French upgrade package offered for existing aircraft with modernized cockpit, HOTAS, improved avionic systems, and laser rangefinder replaced by Phazotron/Thomson-CSF radar.

=== Su-22U ===
The S-52U two-seat combat-trainer, export version of the Su-17UM, with a completely re-designed nose housing the tandem cockpits for student and instructor.
Gun pods such as the GSh-23 based UPK-23 and SPPU-22 were utilized by the Su-17, Su-20, and Su-22. The SPPU-22 ground attack variant featured 30 degrees of traverse.

An experimental version of the Su-20 was built with fixed wings attached to an Su-17M fuselage, in an effort to increase Payload/range performance by eliminating the weight of the wing sweep system. Good results were obtained in flight tests in 1973, but further development was cancelled.

Tactical Reconnaissance versions of all variants could be made by fitting the KKR (Kombinirovannyi Konteiner Razvedky – combined reconnaissance pod) on the centre-line hardpoint.

<text>Repeatability or test–retest reliability is the closeness of the agreement between the results of successive measurements of the same measure, when carried out under the same conditions of measurement. In other words, the measurements are taken by a single person or instrument on the same item, under the same conditions, and in a short period of time. A less-than-perfect test–retest reliability causes test–retest variability. Such variability can be caused by, for example, intra-individual variability and inter-observer variability. A measurement may be said to be &quot;repeatable&quot; when this variation is smaller than a predetermined acceptance criterion.

Test–retest variability is practically used, for example, in medical monitoring of conditions. In these situations, there is often a predetermined &quot;critical difference&quot;, and for differences in monitored values that are smaller than this critical difference, the possibility of variability as a sole cause of the difference may be considered in addition to, for example, changes in diseases or treatments.

==Conditions==
The following conditions need to be fulfilled in the establishment of repeatability: 

*the same experimental tools
*the same observer
*the same measuring instrument, used under the same conditions
*the same location
*repetition over a short period of time.
*same objectives
Repeatability methods were developed by Bland and Altman (1986).

If the correlation between separate administrations of the test is high (e.g. 0.7 or higher as in this Cronbach&#x27;s alpha-internal consistency-table), then it has good test–retest reliability.

The repeatability coefficient is a precision measure which represents the value below which the absolute difference between two repeated test results may be expected to lie with a probability of 95%.

The standard deviation under repeatability conditions is part of precision and accuracy.

==Attribute agreement analysis for defect databases==
An attribute agreement analysis is designed to simultaneously evaluate the impact of repeatability and reproducibility on accuracy. It allows the analyst to examine the responses from multiple reviewers as they look at several scenarios multiple times. It produces statistics that evaluate the ability of the appraisers to agree with themselves (repeatability), with each other (reproducibility), and with a known master or correct value (overall accuracy) for each characteristic – over and over again.

==Psychological testing==

Because the same test is administered twice and every test is parallel with itself, differences between scores on the test and scores on the retest should be due solely to measurement error. This sort of argument is quite probably true for many physical measurements. However, this argument is often inappropriate for psychological measurement, because it is often impossible to consider the second administration of a test a parallel measure to the first.

The second administration of a psychological test might yield systematically different scores than the first administration due to the following reasons:

# The attribute that is being measured may change between the first test and the retest. For example, a reading test that is administered in September to a third grade class may yield different results when retaken in June. One would expect some change in children&#x27;s reading ability over that span of time, a low test–retest correlation might reflect real changes in the attribute itself.
# The experience of taking the test itself can change a person&#x27;s true score. For example, completing an anxiety inventory could serve to increase a person&#x27;s level of anxiety.
# Carryover effect, particularly if the interval between test and retest is short. When retested, people may remember their original answer, which could affect answers on the second administration.

<doc id="986669" wikidata="Q7704329" url="?curid=986669" title="Terry Duguid">
<text>Terry Duguid (born 1954 or 1955) is a Canadian politician who is serving as the minister of Sport and minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada since 2024 and member of Parliament (MP) for Winnipeg South since 2015. He has campaigned for elected office at the municipal, provincial and federal levels, and served as a city councillor in Winnipeg from 1989 to 1995.

== Background ==
Duguid is the son of professional curling athlete Don Duguid. Duguid holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and a Master&#x27;s Degree in Environmental Science. He has been involved a variety of eco-business pursuits in the Winnipeg area, including being president of &quot;Sustainable Development International&quot;, and serving as chairman of the Manitoba Clean Environment Commission. He was president and CEO of the Gateway North Marketing Agency, which is responsible for ensuring the survival of the Port of Churchill and the Hudson Bay Rail Line. He is also the founding president of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases, a not-for-profit organization created after the outbreak of SARS to support and enhance the mandate of the Public Health Agency of Canada.

==Career==
Prior to his entry to politics Duguid was a long-time environmental activist. He was executive director of the Manitoba Liberal Party in the 1980s.

He served as a member of Winnipeg City Council from 1989 to 1995 for the wards of Miles MacDonell (20,000 constituents) and North Kildonan (40,000 constituents). He was chairman of the Public Works Committee. In that position he helped create Winnipeg&#x27;s blue box recycling program. He stepped down as councillor to run for mayor of Winnipeg in 1995, but the incumbent mayor, Susan Thompson, was re-elected.

===Post-city council===
After municipal politics, Duguid had a successful career as a leader and executive in the not-for-profit sector. From 1995 to 1997, he was president and CEO of Gateway North International, working to secure a future for the rail line that leads to the Port of Churchill. He oversaw the transfer of both the rail line and the port, together worth $100 million, to a new owner.

From 1997 to 2000, he was president of Sustainable Development International, a consulting firm specializing in conservation and international management. From 2000 to 2004, Duguid was chairman of Manitoba&#x27;s Clean Environment Commission, which is responsible for carrying out public hearings for major development projects, including forestry and hydro-electric development.

Duguid was the founding president of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases in Winnipeg, beginning as such in 2004 and serving until 2009. Duguid had been part of the original task force that set out to make recommendations to improve Canada&#x27;s response to infectious disease outbreaks in the wake of the SARS epidemic of 2003, especially in Toronto. The task force recommended the establishment of ICID and the Public Health Agency of Canada, with both to be located in Winnipeg.

===Federal politics===

In the 2004 Canadian federal election, Duguid was the Liberal candidate in the north Winnipeg riding of Kildonan—St. Paul, a riding previously held by Liberal MP Rey Pagtakhan, who chose to run in a different riding. Duguid narrowly lost (13582 votes to 13304) to Conservative candidate Joy Smith. He ran against Smith again in 2006, but Smith was re-elected in an election that saw the Conservatives win a minority government.

Duguid ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Winnipeg South in the 2011 Canadian federal election. He finished second behind the incumbent Conservative, Rod Bruinooge.

====Winnipeg South Member of Parliament====
The 2015 federal election again saw Duguid running as the Liberal candidate in Winnipeg South; this time he was elected as the Liberals replaced the Conservative majority government with one of their own, which also included winning six of Winnipeg&#x27;s other seven House seats. After the election Duguid was appointed as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Families, Children, and Social Development, Jean-Yves Duclos. Duguid was then named Parliamentary Secretary for the Status of Women on 28 January 2017, serving under Maryam Monsef. He was a member of the Canada-China Legislative Association and served as vice-chair of the group. He traveled together with multi-party colleagues of the association for a two-week tour through China in August 2017. Duguid was also a member and vice-chair of the Canada-Africa Parliamentary Association.

Duguid was appointed the government lead for the efforts to clean-up Lake Winnipeg by Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, in November 2017. He would direct $25.7 million in federal spending which flow through the Lake Winnipeg Basin Program to address toxic algae blooms. Duguid has served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change since 3 December 2021.

A longtime advocate on clean water issues, Duguid was successful in advocating for the creation of the Canada Water Agency as well as successfully advocating for its headquarters to be established in Winnipeg.

==== Cabinet Minister ====
Duguid is expected to be appointed as the minister of sport and the minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada on December 20, 2024.

<doc id="986670" wikidata="Q845239" url="?curid=986670" title="Soufrière Hills">
<text>The Soufrière Hills () is an active, complex stratovolcano with many lava domes forming its summit on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. After a long period of dormancy, the Soufrière Hills volcano became active in 1995 and continued to erupt through 2010. Its last eruption was in 2013. Its eruptions have rendered more than half of Montserrat uninhabitable, destroying the capital city, Plymouth, and causing widespread evacuations: about two-thirds of the population have left the island. Chances Peak in the Soufrière Hills was the highest summit on Montserrat until the mid-1990s, but it has since been eclipsed by various rising and falling volcanic domes during the recent volcanic activity.

The volcano is andesitic in nature, and the current pattern of activity includes periods of lava dome growth, punctuated by brief episodes of dome collapse which result in pyroclastic flows, ash venting, and explosive eruption. The volcano is monitored by the Montserrat Volcano Observatory. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a multi-component gas analyzer system, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.

The Centre Hills in the central part of the island and the Silver Hills in the north are older volcanic massifs related to the subduction zone. There are three main parts of the island: the central zone, subduction and exclusion.

==Name==
Many volcanoes in the Caribbean are named Soufrière (French: &quot;sulphur outlet&quot;). These include La Soufrière or Soufrière Saint Vincent on the island of Saint Vincent, and La Grande Soufrière on Guadeloupe.

==Early history==
* 2460 BC (± 70 years): An explosive eruption formed the crater at the top of the volcano.
* 1550 AD (± 50 years): Between 25 and 65 million cubic metres of lava erupted at Castle Peak.

== 1995–1999 eruption ==

Seismic activity had occurred in 1897–1898, 1933–1937, and again in 1966–1967, but the eruption that began on 18 July 1995 was the first since the turn of the 20th century. The first phreatic explosion in this new period of activity occurred on 21 August 1995, and such activity lasted for 18 weeks until it caused an andesitic lava dome formation. This was initially confined by a sector-collapse scar, first identified in the 1930&#x27;s and called English&#x27;s Crater. This period of activity lasted for another 60 weeks, after which there were major dome collapses and two periods of explosive volcanic eruptions and fountain-collapse pyroclastic flows. The explosion blanketed Plymouth, away, in a thick layer of ash and darkened the sky almost completely.

Pyroclastic flows were first observed on 27 March 1996. Although these pyroclastic flows and mudflows were initially confined to unpopulated areas, a major pyroclastic flow on 17 September 1996 caused severe damage to the village of Long Ground, near the volcano. By August 1997, much of the southern part of the island, including most of Plymouth, had been buried by pyroclastic flows.

During this period, the southern portion of the island, including the capital Plymouth, was evacuated three times. The first evacuation lasted from 21 August 1995 – 3 September 1995, after the first phreatic eruption. The second evacuation began on 1 December 1995, due to growth of the lava dome. Residents were allowed back to most areas, including Plymouth, on 1 January 1996, but residents of some areas on the eastern flank of the volcano were not allowed back until 15 January 1996. On 3 April 1996, after pyroclastic flows and mudflows began occurring regularly, southern Montserrat, including the capital, Plymouth, was permanently evacuated.

Earthquakes continued to occur in three epicentre zones: beneath the Soufrière Hills volcano, in the ridge running to the northeast, and beneath St George&#x27;s Hill, about to the northwest. A large eruption on 25 June 1997 resulted in the deaths of nineteen people. The island&#x27;s airport was directly in the path of the main pyroclastic flow and was completely destroyed. Montserrat&#x27;s tourist industry also collapsed, although it began partially to recover within fifteen years.

The governments of the United Kingdom and Montserrat led the aid effort, including a £41 million package provided to the Montserrat population; however, riots followed as the people protested that the British Government was not doing enough for aid relief. The riots followed a £10 million aid offer by International Development Secretary Clare Short, prompting the resignation of Bertrand Osborne, then Chief Minister of Montserrat, after allegations that he was too pro-British and had not demanded a better offer.

The British destroyer took a major role in evacuating Montserrat&#x27;s population to other islands, including Antigua and Barbuda who warned they would not be able to cope with many more refugees. About 7,000 people, or two-thirds of the population, left Montserrat; 4,000 went to the United Kingdom.

==Activity since 1999==

On 24 December 2006, streaks of red from the pyroclastic flows became visible. On 8 January 2007, an evacuation order was issued for areas in the Lower Belham Valley, affecting an additional 100 people.

At 11:27 pm local time on Monday 28 July 2008, an eruption began without any precursory activity. Pyroclastic flow lobes reached Plymouth. These involved juvenile material originating in the collapse of the eruption column. In addition, a small part of the eastern side of the lava dome collapsed, generating a pyroclastic flow in Tar River Valley. Several large explosions were registered, with the largest at approximately 11:38 pm. The height of the ash column was estimated at 12,000 m (40,000 ft) above sea level.

The volcano has become one of the most closely monitored volcanoes in the world since its eruption began, with the Montserrat Volcano Observatory taking detailed measurements and reporting on its activity to the government and population of Montserrat. The observatory is operated by the British Geological Survey, under contract to the government of Montserrat.

The 9 October 2008 issue of the journal &quot;Science&quot; suggested that two interconnected magma chambers lie beneath the surface of the volcano on Montserrat – one six kilometres below the surface and the other below the surface. The journal also showed a link between surface behaviour and the size of the deeper magma chamber.

On 5 February 2010, a vulcanian explosion simultaneously propelled pyroclastic flows down several sides of the mountain, and on 11 February 2010, a partial collapse of the lava dome sent large ash clouds over sections of several nearby islands, including Guadeloupe and Antigua. Inhabited areas of Montserrat itself received very little ash accumulation during either event.

On 12 February 2010, at 1200 UTC/GMT, Meteosat SEVIRI Channel 7 shows the ash plume from the eruption was caught up within the warm sector of a frontal system heading towards western Europe exacerbating two East Atlantic winter storms. [reference] Violent storms accompanied by torrential rain and high wind passed over Madeira on 20 February and western Europe on 26–28 February. In Madeira there was at least 48 fatalities and damage to infrastructure at a total estimated cost of 4 billion Euros. The storm landfalling in western France (named &#x27;Cyclone Xynthia&#x27;) resulted in at least 63 fatalities and estimated damage within the range of 1.3-3 billion Euros.

==In popular culture==
* Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s song Volcano and album of the same title are named for Soufrière Hills, and the album&#x27;s cover artwork features a drawing of smoke spewing from the volcano&#x27;s summit. Buffett recorded the album at AIR Studios in the town of Salem on the island in 1979 and drew inspiration for the song from relaxing at a hot spring at the volcano&#x27;s base. The studio was damaged by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and never reopened.
* Season 3, episode 13 of the National Geographic television documentary programme &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; talks about the events surrounding the eruption.

<doc id="986673" wikidata="Q384459" url="?curid=986673" title="Doorbell">
<text>A doorbell is a signaling device typically placed near a door to a building&#x27;s entrance. When a visitor presses a button, the bell rings inside the building, alerting the occupant to the presence of the visitor. Although the first doorbells were mechanical, activated by pulling a cord connected to a bell, modern doorbells are electric, operated by a pushbutton switch. Modern doorbells often incorporate intercoms and miniature video cameras to increase security.

==History==
William Murdoch, a Scottish inventor, installed a number of his own innovations in his house, built in Birmingham in 1817; one of these was a loud doorbell, that worked using a piped system of compressed air. A precursor to the electric doorbell, specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an electric wire, was invented by Joseph Henry around 1831. By the early 1900s, electric doorbells had become commonplace.

==Wired doorbells==
In most wired systems, a button on the outside next to the door, located around the height of the doorknob, activates a signaling device (usually a chime, bell, or buzzer) inside the building. Pressing the doorbell button, a single-pole, single-throw (SPST) pushbutton switch momentarily closes the doorbell circuit. One terminal of this button is wired to a terminal on a transformer. A doorbell transformer steps down the 120 or 240-volt AC electrical power to a lower voltage, typically 6 to 24 volts. The transformer&#x27;s other terminal connects to one of three terminals on the signaling device. Another terminal is connected to a wire that travels to the other terminal on the button. Some signaling devices have a third terminal, which produces a different sound. If there is another doorbell button (typically near a back door), it is connected between the transformer and the third terminal. The transformer primary winding, being energized continuously, does consume a small amount (about 1 to 2 watts) of standby power constantly; systems with lighted pushbutton switches may consume a similar amount of power per switch. The tradeoff is that the wiring to the button carries only safe, low-voltage power isolated from earth ground.

A common signaling device is a chime unit consisting of two flat metal bar resonators, which are struck by a plunger operated by a solenoid. The flat bars are tuned to two pleasing notes. When the doorbell button is pressed, the solenoid&#x27;s plunger strikes one bar, and when the button is released, a spring on the plunger pushes the plunger back, causing it to strike the other bar, creating a two-tone sound (&quot;&quot;ding-dong&quot;). If a second doorbell button is used, it might be wired to a second solenoid, which strikes only one of the bars, to create a single-tone sound (&quot;ding&quot;&quot;). Alternatively, the second button might feed the single solenoid via an oscillating switch (often a mercury tilt switch), to give a &quot;warbling&quot; sound (&quot;ding-dong-ding-dong-ding-dong&quot;). The Edwards Sylvan C-26 had both additional features, suiting three doors. Some chimes have tubular bells instead of bars.

More elaborate doorbell chimes play a short musical tune, such as the Westminster Quarters.

Doorbells for hearing-impaired people use visual signaling devices — typically light bulbs — rather than audible signaling devices.

Fully battery-powered wired models are also common, either using a two-bar design or an electric bell. These do not consume standby power, but require the user to change the batteries, which are usually large primary cells located in the bell box.

==Wireless doorbells==

In recent decades, wireless doorbells have become popular, to avoid the expense of running wires through the building walls. The doorbell button contains a built-in radio transmitter powered by a battery. When the button is pushed, the transmitter sends a radio signal to the receiver unit, which is plugged into a wall outlet inside the building. When the radio signal is detected by the receiver, it activates a sound chip that plays the sound of gongs through a loudspeaker—either a two-note &quot;ding-dong&quot; sound, or a longer chime sequence such as the &quot;Westminster Quarters&quot;. Frequencies in the 2.4 GHz ISM band are usually used. To avoid interference by nearby wireless doorbells on the same radio frequency, the units can usually be set by the owner to different radio channels.

In larger metropolitan cities, a trend has developed over the past decade that uses telephone technology to wirelessly signal doorbells, as well as to answer the doors and remotely release electric strikes. In many cities throughout the world, this is the predominant form of doorbell signalling.

==Musical and continuous power doorbells==
As with wireless doorbells, musical doorbells have also become more common. Musical and continuous power doorbells serve as an attempt to bridge the gap between newer digital circuitry and older doorbell wiring schemes. A major difference between the standard setup of a wired doorbell and a musical doorbell is that the musical doorbell must maintain power after the doorbell button is released, to continue playing the doorbell song. This can be achieved in one of two ways.

For simple single-pole, single-throw doorbell buttons, the chime device employs a rectifier diode and ballast capacitor at the voltage input stage of the circuit. Upon pressing the doorbell button, power is connected through the rectifier diode or series of rectifier diodes called a full wave rectifier, which allows the current to flow in only one direction, into the ballast capacitor. The ballast capacitor charges at a rate far greater than the rest of the circuit needs to complete a given song. Once the button is released, the capacitor retains the charge and maintains power for a short duration to the rest of the circuit.

For mixed wireless and wired input doorbells, a special doorbell button is needed to maintain power continuously to the doorbell chime. The circuit is similar to the one above, except that the rectifier diode is now moved into the doorbell button housing. Pressing the doorbell button allows both negative and positive sides of the AC power signal to flow into the circuit, while releasing the button only allows either the positive or negative side to flow into the circuit. By differentiating the full and half wave signals, the doorbell is able to function as it does in the previous wired case, while also providing continuous power to the doorbell for other purposes, such as receiving wireless doorbell button input.

==Smart doorbells==
With the rise of the Internet of Things in the 2010s, a number of internet-connected bell systems, known as smart doorbells have appeared on the market.

Popular systems include the Ring doorbell, Vivint Home Security doorbell, and the Nest Hello. These consist of a single unit which is located in place of the traditional push-button, and in addition to a physical button, contains a high-definition camera, passive infrared sensor and Wi-Fi capability. The device is connected to the home Wi-Fi network, and notifications of a button-press or detected movement are pushed to a paired smartphone or other electronic device such as a tablet. When a notification is received, the user will typically see a live video stream from the smart doorbell, showing who is at the door and potentially allowing a 2-way audio conversation.

The devices can be powered by an internal battery, or they may use the existing bell wiring for continuous power.

The video is typically recorded via Wi-Fi to a cloud internet service, meaning that if the unit is tampered with, damaged or stolen, then this recording will still be captured and can be analyzed to determine the identity of the responsible party.

<text>James Charles Sholto Burchett Queen&#x27;s Counsel, born in Goodooga, New South Wales, on 11 October 1930, died 30 September 2012, was Justice of the Federal Court of Australia between June 1985 and October 2000 and was president of the Australian Copyright Tribunal.

In 1996 he handed a series of judgements which delayed the start of the Super League rugby league breakaway competition.

He conducted the 2001 Inquiry into Military Justice in the Australian Defence Force, which concluded that there was not a culture of widespread or systemic avoidance of due disciplinary processes, nor the use of violence to maintain discipline, in the ADF.

Burchett was appointed as the independent code reviewer for the Australian copyright collecting societies&#x27; voluntary code of conduct, to monitor and report on compliance with the code. He was Chairperson of the Australian Electoral Commission between 2003 and 2009.

Burchett also served as a judge on the Court of Appeal of Tonga.

<doc id="986684" wikidata="Q3420050" url="?curid=986684" title="Rate limiting">
<text>In computer networks, rate limiting is used to control the rate of requests sent or received by a network interface controller. It can be used to prevent DoS attacks and limit web scraping.

Research indicates flooding rates for one zombie machine are in excess of 20 HTTP GET requests per second, legitimate rates much less.

Rate limiting should be used along with throttling pattern to minimize the number of throttling errors. 

== Hardware appliances ==
Hardware appliances can limit the rate of requests on layer 4 or 5 of the OSI model. 

Rate limiting can be induced by the network protocol stack of the sender due to a received ECN-marked packet and also by the network scheduler of any router along the way. 

While a hardware appliance can limit the rate for a given range of IP-addresses on layer 4, it risks blocking a network with many users which are masked by NAT with a single IP address of an ISP. 

Deep packet inspection can be used to filter on the session layer but will effectively disarm encryption protocols like TLS and SSL between the appliance and the protocol server (i.e. web server).

== Protocol servers ==

Protocol servers using a request / response model, such as FTP servers or typically Web servers may use a central in-memory key-value database, like Redis or Aerospike, for session management. A rate limiting algorithm is used to check if the user session (or IP address) has to be limited based on the information in the session cache. 

In case a client made too many requests within a given time frame, HTTP servers can respond with status code 429: Too Many Requests.

However, in some cases (i.e. web servers) the session management and rate limiting algorithm should be built into the application (used for dynamic content) running on the web server, rather than the web server itself.

When a protocol server or a network device notice that the configured request limit is reached, then it will offload new requests and not respond to them. Sometimes they may be added to a queue to be processed once the input rate reaches an acceptable level, but at peak times the request rate can even exceed the capacities of such queues and requests have to be thrown away.

== Data centers ==
Data centers widely use rate limiting to control the share of resources given to different tenants and applications according to their service level agreement. A variety of rate limiting techniques are applied in data centers using software and hardware. Virtualized data centers may also apply rate limiting at the hypervisor layer. Two important performance metrics of rate limiters in data centers are resource footprint (memory and CPU usage) which determines scalability, and precision. There usually exists a trade-off, that is, higher precision can be achieved by dedicating more resources to the rate limiters. A considerable body of research with focus on improving performance of rate limiting in data centers.

<text>Alexander Woodruff Buel (December 13, 1813 – April 19, 1868) was an American lawyer and politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. A Democrat, he was most notable for his service as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1849 to 1851 and his multiple terms as a member of the Michigan House of Representatives.

==Early life==
Buel was born in Castleton, Vermont, and exhibited precocious intellectual abilities. He attended the public schools in Poultney, Vermont, until the age of eight, at which time he began an accelerated course of studies preparing for college under the private tutelage of Henry Howe, the former principal of the Canandaiga Academy in Canandaigua, New York. In 1824, at the age of 10, he passed the admission exams for Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont, and was admitted to the college. However, concerned about the difference in age between Buel and the other college students, his teacher and family persuaded him to continue his independent studies for three years. In 1827, at the age of 13, Buel accompanied one of his teachers and was enrolled as a sophomore at the University of Vermont in Burlington, where he stayed for one year. In 1828, he decided to attend Middlebury College, which was his original intent. He was enrolled there as a junior and also taught at the common schools in Clarendon.

==Career==
In August 1830, at the age of 16, Buel graduated from Middlebury College ranked first in his class. In September 1830, he became superintendent of a classical academy in West Rutland. In November 1831, he was invited to become principal of a classical academy at Fort Covington in northern New York, where he also began to study law. In December, 1832, he returned to his father&#x27;s residence in Castleton and continued his study of law while also teaching at the Castleton Academy.

In October 1834, Buell moved to Detroit, Michigan, and within two months became Deputy Register of the Court of Probate. Because of his language skills, he was able to converse with the many French speakers native to Detroit at the time, as well as the increasing number of German immigrants. He admitted to the bar in the spring of 1835 and commenced practice in Detroit.

Buel was city attorney in 1837 and a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1838 and again in 1848, serving as speaker the latter year. He was the prosecuting attorney for Wayne County 1843–1846.

Buel first ran for the United States House of Representatives in Michigan&#x27;s 1st congressional district in 1846, but lost in a close election. In 1848, Buel was elected as a Democrat from Michigan&#x27;s 1st district to the United States Congress for the Thirty-first Congress, succeeding fellow Democrat Robert McClelland who did not run. Buel served from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1851. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1850 to the Thirty-second Congress and resumed the practice of law. He was again a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1859 and 1860. He was appointed postmaster of Detroit on September 28, 1860, and served until March 18, 1861.

==Death==
Buel died at his home in Detroit on April 19, 1868 (age 54 years, 128 days). He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery, Detroit.

==Family life==
Buel was the son of Ezekial and Sally Thompson Buel. He married Mary Ann Ackley of West Rutland, Vermont, in October 1836, and they raised four daughters, one of whom was Julia Maria Buel Trowbridge. On April 8, 1862, she married Gen. Luther Stephen Trowbridge (Buel&#x27;s law partner). The others were: Mary B., wife of Charles H. Wetmore; Clara B., wife of Col. James Mercur; and Delia W., wife of Gen. Garrett J. Lydecker.

<doc id="986695" wikidata="Q391566" url="?curid=986695" title="Qu'Appelle River">
<text>The Qu&#x27;Appelle River is a river in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba that flows east from Lake Diefenbaker in south-western Saskatchewan to join the Assiniboine River in Manitoba, just south of Lake of the Prairies, near the village of St. Lazare. It is in a region called the Prairie Pothole Region of North America, which extends throughout three Canadian provinces and five U.S. states. It is also within Palliser&#x27;s Triangle and the Great Plains ecoregion.

With the construction of the Qu&#x27;Appelle River Dam and Gardiner Dam upstream, water flow was significantly increased and regulated. Most of the Qu&#x27;Appelle&#x27;s present flow is actually water diverted from the South Saskatchewan River.

== Upper and lower watersheds ==

According to the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency, the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley is made up of two watersheds with the dividing point being Craven Dam on the east side of Craven:

=== Lower Qu&#x27;Appelle Watershed ===
The Lower Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley is in the south-eastern part of Saskatchewan and covers an area of . The Lower Qu&#x27;Appelle Watershed begins at the Craven Dam east of the village of Craven and extends to the Manitoba border. In the Lower Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley, the river flows through six major lakes. From west to east are the Pasqua, Echo, Mission, Katepwa, Crooked, and Round Lakes. Major tributaries in this watershed are Loon, Jumping Deer, Pheasant, and Kapsovar Creeks. Lesser tributaries include the Pearl, Indianhead, Redfox, Ekapo, Cutarm, and Scissor Creeks.

=== The Wascana &amp; Upper Qu’Appelle Watersheds ===
The Wascana &amp; Upper Qu’Appelle Watersheds are made up of four sub-basins and the Moose Jaw River Watershed. The four sub-basins total about and the Moose Jaw River Watershed adds a further . The total combined drainage basin for the Upper Qu&#x27;Appelle Watershed is .

The four sub-basins include the Lanigan-Manitou Sub-basin, Wascana Creek Sub-basin, Last Mountain Lake Sub-basin, and the Upper Qu&#x27;Appelle Sub-basin. The Upper Qu&#x27;Appelle Sub-basin includes all of the remaining land not included in the other basins all the way up to Qu&#x27;Appelle River Dam.

The Upper Qu&#x27;Appelle River is fed by several rivers and creeks which include Ridge Creek, Iskwao Creek, High Hill Creek, Deer Run Creek, Wascana Creek, Boggy, and Flying Creeks, Last Mountain Creek, and Moose Jaw River. There are two major lakes along the course of the river in the Upper Qu&#x27;Appelle Sub-basin: Buffalo Pound Lake and Eyebrow Lake. Another major lake, Last Mountain Lake, flows into the Upper Qu&#x27;Appelle River through Last Mountain Creek at Craven.

== Description ==
The river flows into several lakes in south-east Saskatchewan, including:
*Eyebrow Lake, Buffalo Pound Lake to the north of Moose Jaw, which supplies water to Moose Jaw, Regina, and the Mosaic Potash Mine at Belle Plaine;
*The Fishing Lakes (Pasqua, Echo, Mission, and Katepwa lakes) to the north-east of Regina; and,
*farther downstream, to the north of Grenfell and Broadview: Crooked Lake and Round Lake.

Assorted tributary coulees drain into the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley at various junctures along its course, notably Echo Creek immediately upriver from Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle, and Last Oak Creek, north of Grenfell and Broadview, in the past the locus of an extremely successful aboriginal-managed ski resort. The other tributaries include the Moose Jaw River, Wascana Creek, Loon Creek, Jumping Deer Creek, Pheasant Creek, Kaposvar Creek, and Last Mountain Creek.

93% of the land in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Rivershed is used for agriculture purposes.

Last Mountain Lake, also known as Long Lake, the largest natural lake in southern Saskatchewan (Lake Diefenbaker is larger but is a reservoir behind the Gardiner and Qu&#x27;Appelle River Dams), drains into the Qu&#x27;Appelle near the town of Craven, through Last Mountain Creek.

== History ==

In 1787, the North West Company established a fur trading post at Fort Espérance on the lower river. After it was abandoned in 1819, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established a post at Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle in 1852 immediately adjacent to the site of what became the town of the same name.

The Qu&#x27;Appelle River and Valley derive their name from a Cree legend of a spirit that travels up and down it. The aboriginal people told the North West Company trader Daniel Harmon in 1804 that they often heard the voice of a human calling, &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;What is calling?&quot; (&quot;&quot; in French). They would respond, and the call would echo back (there is a strong echo phenomenon at Lebret).

Pauline Johnson, a half-Mohawk poet, learned of the legend and elaborated upon it with Victorian sentiment. In her version, a young Cree swain heard his name while crossing one of the lakes and replied, &quot;Who calls?&quot; Only his echo could be heard (hence Echo Lake), and he realized it had been his bride-to-be calling out his name at the instant of her death. There has been local civic-booster advocacy to rename the Fishing Lakes as the Calling Lakes, so as further to emphasize Pauline Johnson&#x27;s &quot;legend of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley&quot;.

The name of the river in the Cree language is .

In June 2021, hundreds of unmarked graves were found at the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley&#x27;s former Marieval Indian residential school on the Cowessess 73 reserve in Marieval, part of the Canadian Indian residential school system, the most found in Canada to date.

== Communities ==
While there are no large population centres along the course of the river, only small towns, Indian reserves, villages, and resort villages, within the river&#x27;s watershed is the province&#x27;s second largest city and capital, Regina. St. Lazare is the only community on the river in Manitoba and it sits at the confluence of the Assiniboine and Qu&#x27;Appelle Rivers.

=== Reserve lands ===
The Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley is in Treaty 4 territory and is home to the Cree, Saulteaux, Dakota, and Nakota peoples who have inhabited the last 11,000 years. However, due to acts such as the Indian Act of 1876, Indigenous peoples were forced to live on reserves. The Indian reserves located within the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley include Piapot, Pasqua, Muscowpetung, Standing Buffalo, Cowessess, Kahkewistahaw, Sakimay, and Ochapowace.

=== Towns and villages ===
There are two towns and two villages in the valley along the course of the river. The first town within the valley is Lumsden with a total population of 1,824. The second town in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley is Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle with a total population of 2,027. Located approximately north-east of Regina, the town of Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle is located between Echo Lake and Mission Lake. This town is of historical significance as it acted as a confluence between major trails that were positioned across the North-West Territories and as it was the place of signing for Treaty 4. The first village within the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley is Craven which is located north-east of Regina at the junction of Highways 20 and 99. This village is home to the Country Thunder Music Festival—previously known as the Craven Country Jamboree. Although the population of Craven year-round is 214, when the Craven Country Jamboree is on, it becomes as populated as the biggest cities in Saskatchewan. The second village within the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley is Tantallon, which has a total population of 91. This village is located off of Highway 8, and is known for its large statue of a whitetail deer.

=== Buffalo Pound Lake ===
The residential areas of Buffalo Pound Lake consist of multiple communities made up of both seasonal and year-round houses and cabins. Resort villages consist of North Grove, Sun Valley, and South Lake. Hamlets on Buffalo Pound Lake consist of Parkview and Sand Point Beach.

=== Fishing Lakes ===
The residential areas of the four Fishing Lakes consist of multiple communities made up of both seasonal and year-round houses and cabins. These communities consist of both resort villages and hamlets and are spread out among the four lakes. The resort villages are Fort San, and B-Say-Tah, and multiple communities representing the District of Katepwa. In addition to the resort villages, the organized hamlets consist of Pasqua Lake and Taylor Beach.

=== Crooked and Round Lakes ===
The residential areas of Crooked Lake are Sunset Beach, Moose Bay, Exner Twins Bay, Lakeside Beach, Melville Beach, Grenfell Beach, and Greenspot. East of Crooked Lake is Round Lake. The residential areas of Round Lake consist of two resort villages: Birds Point and West End.

==Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley ecology==

=== Ecosystems in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley ===
The Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley is made up of two ecosystems: grasslands and wetlands. The temperate grassland ecosystem is one of the world&#x27;s most endangered ecosystems as it is often converted into farmland or developed for human expansion. Grasslands are dominated mostly by grass species and various herbs. Few tree types grow in grasslands and if they do they are stunted due to the variability of moisture and temperature. Plants must have high tolerance to drought due to the low and varying precipitation. Roots of these plants grow deep into the ground in order to connect to the groundwater in the soil and reduce erosion. Wetlands in the valley ecosystem provide food and habitat for animals and also enhance water quality by filtering out toxins, water pollutants, and over accumulation of nutrients. Wetlands store rain water and overflows from rivers in order to reduce flooding, while the groundwater supply is fed through the watershed.

=== Flora ===
Forests of trembling aspen and green ash grow on the slopes of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley while grasslands grow on the south facing slope of the valley. There are rich wetlands and riparian vegetation, as well as hayfields and cultivated land on the valley floor. Bur oak mainly take up the eastern section of the valley appearing on the southern facing slopes.

=== Fauna ===

==== Aquatic species ====
There are 30 small- and large-bodied fish species that live in the water system in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley and make up 45% of the fish biodiversity in Saskatchewan. The bigmouth buffalo, a fish species restricted only to the Qu&#x27;Appelle River watershed, is under federal protection as it is at risk of becoming extinct due to habitat loss. The Water Security Agency speculates that dams and structures that control water have caused the degradation of spawning habitats for bigmouth buffalo due to the alteration of the natural flow of lakes and river systems. The Water Security Agency states that the highest threat to the bigmouth buffalo population is demand of water used for agricultural, commercial, and domestic purposes. The brown bullhead, channel catfish, chestnut lamprey, and rock bass, are some other uncommon fish that are found in the valley. The rock bass are Saskatchewan&#x27;s only native bass. Other fish species found in the river&#x27;s and lakes of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Watershed include walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike, lake whitefish, cisco, mooneye, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, common carp, black bullhead, burbot, and chub.

==== Terrestrial species ====
Bird species in the valley include the wood duck, eastern wood-pewee, lazuli bunting, and indigo bunting. Painted and snapping turtles can be found in the river and drainage systems that enter it. Some eastern animals found in the valley include the eastern grey squirrel, red belly snake, and smooth green snake. This area is also home to around 30 endangered animal species including loggerhead shrike, and the northern leopard frog.

=== Air and atmospheric conditions ===
Climatic characteristics that are common to the grasslands ecosystems are: high evaporation rates, droughts, low precipitation, and high summer temperatures. This moist-mixed grassland biome has a sub-humid continental climate. As such, it is generally dry, sunny, and has extreme temperatures in summer and winter. The mean annual precipitation is . Between 1981 and 2010, the mean temperature for January was and the mean temperature for July was .

=== Soil and terrain ===
The soil surface texture varies from loamy sand to loam and is low to moderately sensitive to compaction. The more compaction, the less the soil is capable of supporting plant growth. Because of the short warm season and long, cold winters, vegetation routinely dies and decomposers do not have adequate time to breakdown all the material. As a result, the groundcover of litter is built up. A large quantity of nutrients is stored in this litter as opposed to in the soil as it takes three to four years to be broken down in the grasslands. Because of the accumulation of plant litter on the top soil horizon, the soil is chernozemic and has a colour that varies from light brown to black. The soil is neutral to slightly alkaline, and it has a texture that is medium to moderately fine. Where the plants have been removed or replaced by invasive species, there is more erosion. As a result of the seasonal variability, there is significant erosion that occurs from the snowmelt each spring. The effects are intensified where there is little ground cover present. There is also more sediment deposited where agriculture has taken place because the disruption of the land has accelerated the erosion of the soil. 14,000 years ago the last ice age retreated, forming the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley and leaving many glacial deposits and evidence in the soil. The municipality of Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle sits on alluvial deposits that consists of silt, sand, clay, gravel, and other organic material deposited by the glacier. In some parts of the valley, the deposits are thick.

== Water management within the Qu&#x27;Appelle ==

=== Watershed plans ===
Each watershed has its own water resources protection plan. The lower Qu&#x27;Appelle watershed plan is available here and the upper Qu&#x27;Appelle plan here. In the spring of 2009, planning staff from the Water Security Agency (WSA) invited stakeholders in the Lower Qu&#x27;Appelle River Watershed to participate in watershed planning. These stakeholders, representing various organizations within the watershed, formed two watershed advisory committees (WAC): the Eastern and Western Lower Qu&#x27;Appelle River WACs. The committees discuss aquifer protection, lake and river water management, and governance and legislative requirements.

=== Water supply and demand in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley ===
93% of the land in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Watershed is used for agricultural purposes. Five potash mines are in the basin and an increase in irrigation development is expected. Water demand is anticipated to increase by 126% from 2010 to 2060. On low flow years, Lake Diefenbaker supplies roughly 90% of the flow of the Qu&#x27;Appelle River. This water mainly originates from mountain snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains of Alberta. The South Saskatchewan River, which flows into Lake Diefenbaker, has seen flow rates drop by 12% in the last century. With only 2% increase from runoff, water scarcity could be a problem in the near future. On the other hand, severe flooding of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley could also occur. Studies suggest that due to climate change, 31% to 46% of glacier volume of the eastern Rockies could melt by 2100.

=== Water demand under the baseline scenario ===
In 2010, demand for water in the Qu&#x27;Appelle River Basin was estimated at with direct anthropogenic demands accounting for 22.6% of the total demand. By 2060, estimates suggest that irrigation and expansion of the potash sector will account for 44.1% of water demand. Furthermore, there will be an increase of 162% in total direct anthropogenic water demand by 2060. The water demand per sector, according to the scenario analysis, is depicted below. As can be seen, agriculture demands the majority of the water in the Qu&#x27;Appelle basin.

a) Agriculture: 2020 estimated amount of water demand is . 2060 estimated amount of water demand is .

b) Industry and mining: 2010 amount of water demand was . 2020 estimated amount of water demand is . 2060 estimated amount of water demand is .

=== Water demand estimates under climate change scenario ===
Water demand is affected by changes in climate and occurrence of extreme weather related events. In the Qu&#x27;Appelle River Basin, climate change will produce higher temperatures and longer growing seasons which will have significant impacts on demand for water in the agricultural sector since crops and livestock will require more water. Industry and mining are not expected to increase their water demand under the referenced climate change scenario. Municipal and domestic sectors are expected to increase their demand minimally. 

=== Water demand estimates under water conservation scenario ===
Under the water conservation scenario, a 14% reduction in demand could be achieved by reductions in agriculture, industrial, and mining water demands.

=== Impacts on water quality ===
The water quality of freshwater sources in Southern Saskatchewan is poor. This is a result of eutrophication and the high mineral content of the groundwater. According to the Water Security Agency and the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, algae blooms occur during calm, hot weather in lakes with shallow, slow moving, or still water that have acquired high levels of nutrients that promote the blooms. The nutrients come from: crop and livestock production, surface runoff containing fertilizers, pesticides, and manure, waste from waterfront properties, and waste from upstream communities. The Saskatchewan Government&#x27;s 2013 &quot;State of the Watershed&quot; report assessed the overall condition of the Wascana Watershed as &quot;impacted&quot; and the impact of its stressors as being of &quot;high intensity.&quot;

In the Lower Qu&#x27;Appelle River Basin, shoreline properties result in water degradation because many disturb riparian areas and their septic infrastructure is aging and leaking. There is also a lack of policy to regulate and enforce septic infrastructure on shoreline properties. Short-term goals should focus on better education for citizens and cottage goers on how they can mitigate their environmental impact. Some solutions include using phosphate free shampoo, installing low flush toilets, and stopping illegal drainage.

=== Saskwater-Buffalo Pound Lake regional non-potable water supply system ===
Located northeast of Moose Jaw, Buffalo Pound Lake is the first major lake along the path of the Qu&#x27;Appelle river after being released from the Qu&#x27;Appelle River Dam at Lake Diefenbaker. At levels of full supply, Buffalo Pound Lake holds of water that is used for recreation, industrial operations and to supply water to roughly one quarter of the province. This non-potable water supply system is intended to service the needs of multiple industrial customers and meet the ever-growing demands of the Belle Plaine area, particularly with respect to potash mining operations. The proposed project consists of three main parts: an intake and pumping station, a pipeline to carry water to an area south of Kronau, Saskatchewan, and a booster station along the route of the pipeline. A number of potential environmental impacts have been identified. Firstly, the proposed water pipeline would cause ground disturbance and would cross over two major tributaries of the Qu&#x27;Appelle River: the Moose Jaw River and Wascana Creek. Included in the Environmental Impact Statement was the acknowledgement that Buffalo Pound contains at least two species of concern: bigmouth buffalo and the chestnut lamprey. There is concern that development may further threaten these and other fish species. There would be the reduction of habitat for several rare plant and animal species that are known to exist in the area. These include: big bluestem, few flowered aster, low milkvetch, lesser navarretia, Kelsey&#x27;s cryptanthe, the burrowing owl, the piping plover, and the northern leopard frog. This project could also contribute to the loss or alteration of heritage resources used by First Nations and Metis peoples. Increased volume of traffic from vehicles is a concern as well as the ongoing maintenance of the river channels, pipelines, and pumping stations for years to come.

=== Dams in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley ===
In the 1930s, water in the Qu&#x27;Appelle basin became critical due to persistent drought in the prairie and the global economic depression. These incidents prompted the Federal Government to establish the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA). The PFRA was tasked with restoring drought and soil drift zones in the three prairie provinces and assisting in the protection of surface water supplies for household use, livestock and irrigation. Water in the river system was necessary to support human life as well as fisheries, livestock, and irrigation.

In May 1941, the PFRA requested the construction of a dam at the eastern end of Pasqua Lake—which would cause persistent floods in the Maskopetung and Pasqua reserves—and would require approval from the Ministry of Indian Affairs. This dam, known as the Echo Lake Project, was completed in 1942. At first, Indian Affairs believed that the dam project would cause damage to the environment and estimated that a total of $8,050 should be paid to the Muscowpetung and Pasqua Bands. Although both the PFRA and Indian Affairs agreed on the amount, it was never paid to the Bands. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the Muscowpetung and Pasqua Bands actually approved the dam project. Neither band received compensation until 1973 when negotiations began between the Bands and the PFRA. On 16 November 1976, the Bands accepted a one-time payment of $265,000 from the PFRA.

Also in 1941, the Crooked Lake and Round Lake Projects were launched. The PFRA began construction without the consent of the Bands in the dam area, but in 1943 paid $3,300 to the Sakimay, Cowessess and Ochapowace Bands.

== Historical land uses ==

=== Historical Indigenous use of natural resources ===
The Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley corridor has a rich history of trade and natural resource use that dates back prior to written records. Utilizing the local plants and animals, many Indigenous people of the corridor participated in trade and other economic activities. Women picked berries and Seneca root to sell to settlers in addition to use at home, while men cut and sold firewood. Some living Indigenous elders from the Pasqua First Nation recall the days when they would pack up and head to what is now Regina&#x27;s exhibition grounds to sell roots, berries, herbs and crafts.

Regulations such as the Indian Act and prevented Indigenous people from participating in the settler economy and subsequently few Indigenous people of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley corridor were able to financially prosper from such activity. Without permission from the Indian agent, the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley Indigenous people could not leave their reserve to sell their wares nor could they sell or butcher their own cattle. Some Indigenous communities in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley corridor had a complete outfit for grain farming and owned tractors and combines. They became so efficient at farming that they were &quot;shut down&quot; for fear of outcompeting non-native farming operations.

The Indigenous people of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley hunted numerous animal species. Deer, the most common big game which was targeted in the years after Treaty 4 and depletion of wild bison herds, provided food and leather. Other animal species that were hunted in the area included elk, moose, antelope and occasionally black bear. Small game and waterfowl were also targeted due to their abundance near the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley lakes. Ducks (canvasbacks, blue bills, mallards and teals), geese, prairie chickens, partridges and pheasants were among the bird species that were hunted for food. Trapping for furs was also a profitable economic activity to the Indigenous people of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley corridor in the early part of the 20th century. Locals would trap rabbit, beaver, mink, muskrat, coyote, gopher, weasel and skunk and when possible and legal, sell the furs to settlers.

Fishing for food and trade was practiced quite extensively. Targeted species within the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley included walleye, perch, whitefish, northern pike and more. Before the days of treaties and reserve life First Nations people, including those in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley, constructed weirs at the narrow sections of rivers and streams in order to catch fish. Fish were either cooked soon after catch or split and smoked over fire in order to preserve for eating later.

According to testimony from Elders of the Pasqua First Nation, berries are not as numerous as they once were. The berries that were picked in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley included chokecherries, saskatoon berries, cranberries, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and others.

== Contemporary land uses ==
The valley has a number of contemporary uses including hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, and scientific study. Indigenous peoples have a connection to Indigenous knowledge and traditions that is evident in their contemporary use of the land.

=== Hunting ===
Big game and birds are the main focus for hunting in the valley. The primary big game animals include mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, moose, pronghorn, and black bear. These animals are hunted mostly in the fall season because the young are grown and the game tend to be fatter. The birds that are hunted include migratory game birds (geese, ducks, cranes, coots, and snipes), and upland game birds (grouse, partridge, and pheasants). Although hunting is open to everyone, the regulations of hunting for non-Indigenous peoples requires that hunters have a tag for the big game animal they are harvesting. These tags, besides resident whitetail deer, are all handed out through a draw system. Licenses are also required for the hunting of birds. Status First Nation hunters can exercise their right to hunt for the purpose of food without having to obtain a license. Indigenous hunters often demonstrate respect for the animals by leaving tobacco when an animal is taken. This is a way to honor the animal for the life it has given in order to provide food. It is also common for Indigenous hunters to share the meat with elders and people who are not able to hunt themselves.

=== Fishing ===
Those fishing in the valley catch northern pike, walleye, whitefish, tullibee, burbot, yellow perch, carp, bigmouth buffalo, white sucker, and channel catfish. The primary method to fish is by rod and reel throughout all seasons. Some Indigenous fishermen rely on snares to harvest fish. However, non-Indigenous people are required to have a license to fish and are bound to regulations such as fishing seasons and catch limits. The valley is also home to the Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle Fish Culture Station near Echo Lake that produces 20 million walleye a year to be distributed around the province.

=== Trapping ===
People continue to trap rabbit, beaver, coyote, mink, muskrat, lynx, and weasel. Here, the trapping zone is called the Southern Fur Conservation Area (SFCA). The area used by most Indigenous trappers is near the Pasqua First Nation in the fall and winter seasons.

=== Gathering ===
People gather fruits and vegetables along with medicinal plants. The berries that are gathered are chokecherries, saskatoon berries, high-bush cranberries, gooseberries, pincherries, and raspberries. Modern day gatherers still pick medicinal plants, including berries, herbs, and sweetgrass; however, the Pasqua Nation is concerned that knowledge about medicinal plants is being lost.

=== Scientific inquiry ===
Scientific inquiry within the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley is also a significant contemporary use. Studies from the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Regina, among other institutions, look at different features of the valley and how they operate, and have changed. Main fields of study in the valley include limnology, geology, and geography.

== Parks and recreation ==
The Qu&#x27;appelle Valley contains a number of parks and recreational sites including those of Echo Valley, Crooked Lake, Katepwa Point, Regina Beach, Buffalo Pound, Mission Ridge, and Beaver Creek. Echo Lake and the Calling Lakes chain are especially popular and attract many travellers from the city of Regina. Activities occur year-round in the valley despite the cold winters. In the spring and summer, people enjoy canoeing, kayaking, camping, and swimming, while in the fall hiking becomes quite popular. During the winter, activities include skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and sleigh rides.

In addition to the popularity of its lakes as summer recreational locales, the valley also contains popular venues for winter sports including the following:
*White Track ski resort on Buffalo Pound Lake
*Mission Ridge Winter Park, a popular skiing and snowboarding destination on the south shore of Mission Lake immediately adjacent to Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle
*Last Oak Golf Course to the north of Broadview, some east of Regina
*Hang gliding (and, less often, paragliding) from the valley slopes, especially in the Crooked Lake and Round Lake regions. In this area the valley is up to deep and a mile wide, allowing for strong, smooth airflow up the side of the valley and ample landing areas on top and down in the valley, and providing a strong upward component of wind as it flows over the (in some places) optimally rounded valley edge, allowing pilots to soar in the &quot;ridge lift&quot; for many hours at a time. Pilots commonly travel from Manitoba and Alberta and of course other locations in Saskatchewan to fly this natural wonder of the prairies.
*The river valley contains relatively undisturbed grassland and coulees which provide habitat for native plant and animal species, such as the loggerhead shrike and the coyote (locally ). The easternmost slopes contain bur oaks, the only natural occurrence of oak trees in Saskatchewan.

== Industrial land uses ==

=== Moose Jaw-Regina industrial corridor ===
The Moose Jaw-Regina Industrial Corridor holds about 24% of Saskatchewan&#x27;s population and also 20% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the province. The corridor interlinks the cities of Regina and Moose Jaw, crossing six more municipalities in between—the villages of Pense, Grand Coulee, and Belle Plaine, and the Rural Municipalities of Moose Jaw No. 161, Pense No. 160 and Sherwood No. 159. It is adjacent to the four-lane TransCanada Highway and two railways—Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway, providing access to the east and west markets and also to the United States.

=== Suitability of the corridor for industry use ===
The corridor is a well-established area for development; many international corporations have located their subsidiaries there for a number of reasons. Firstly, its location on the TransCanada Highway, with Canadian Pacific Rail and Canadian National Rail allows direct access to markets across Canada and to the United States. The close proximity to the Global Transportation Hub, one of Canada&#x27;s inland ports, feeds material to and from the U.S. border. Furthermore, the Belle Plaine area is considered one of the top four heavy industrial sites in North America. The flatness of the land, with easy access to water, natural gas and electrical power is beneficial for industry. It is also near two of the fastest-growing urban centres in Saskatchewan—Regina and Moose Jaw, which provides easy access to airports for business. Lastly, the area is ideal because of the presence of vast high-quality reserves of potash.

=== Industries in the corridor ===
The Regina-Moose Jaw Industrial Corridor mostly relies on agriculture and agri-value processing, fertilizer production and mining, and energy. This area has experienced massive industrial construction over the last few years. Some of the industrial projects in the corridor include mining, pipelines, railway, and agriculture as well as fertilizer, ethanol, and salt plants.

• Fertilizer: Yara Fertilizer is one of the largest producers of granular urea in North America. The company is in the industrial park of Belle Plaine. Alpine Plant Foods, the leader in liquid fertilizer production in Canada is also in this industrial park.

• Ethanol: Terra Grain Fuels produces ethanol in the corridor. The company&#x27;s ethanol plant has a capacity of approximately of ethanol annually and 163,800 tonnes of dried distillers&#x27; grains annually.

• Salt: K+S Windsor Salt LTD operates a plant at Belle Plaine. This company produces and distributes salt-based products for multiple uses, such as agricultural, industrial, and household uses.

=== Mining production in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley corridor and impacts ===
Saskatchewan&#x27;s potash production is heavily concentrated in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley corridor. As of 2013 there are six mines operating and eight mines in the proposal stage in the Qu&#x27;Appelle River Watershed. Mines in this area access the water necessary for production from three different source points—the Qu&#x27;Appelle River system itself, groundwater, and Lake Diefenbaker (which comes from the Saskatoon South East Water Supply System—SSEWS). Because potash operations are reliant on water sources, this area of Saskatchewan is very attractive for potash production.
=== Pipelines in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley ===
There are two major pipelines that run through the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley Corridor. The first is the TransCanada Mainline system that runs from the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan, straight through to Manitoba, Ontario and part of Quebec. This pipeline is owned by TransCanada Pipelines Limited. The second is the Enbridge Mainline System. Owned by Enbridge Pipelines Inc., this system is used to transport petroleum products as well as natural gas liquids from Western Canada across to Manitoba and down into the United States. An initiative in 2015 by the Nature Conservancy of Canada worked to create safe and ecosystem friendly hiking trails that follow the pipeline routes in order to bring awareness to the fragile ecosystem of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley.

=== Railway in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley ===
Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) provides transportation for oil, grain, consumer products, fertilizers, etc. through the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley and all of Saskatchewan. The CP Belle Plaine Railway Spur was developed to transport potash from the Belle Plaine mine to market, which was done by adding of rail from the mine site to the Kalium Spur near Belle Plaine. This construction was intensive and caused many million cubic metres (tens of million cubic feet) of excavation in order to build the rail beds into farmland and surrounding valley walls. Excavation occurred in areas of the valley that affected aquifers and the Qu&#x27;Appelle River, as well as the addition of a steel tunnel to allow for traffic to travel over the spur. Another addition to the landscape was of culvert to mitigate flooding and manage drainage around the track structure.

==== Railway impacts ====

===== CP Railway Belle Plaine Spur =====
The Belle Plaine Spur was created to facilitate the transportation of potash from the K+S Bethune Legacy mine to various markets across the country. This was done by connecting the new railway from the mine near Findlater to the existing railway, known as the Kalium Spur, near the community of Belle Plaine. While the construction of the spur did promise to create greater economic opportunities in terms of marketing potash, there were major environmental impacts on this section of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley. During construction, there were enormous amounts of dirt and earth moved to facilitate the rail bed. The rail bed was built by KPCL Dirt Movers who estimate that during the construction phase, of earth was excavated and there was of embankment construction.

===== CP Railway Belle Plaine Spur impacts =====
CP Railway chose the shortest and most direct route to the Legacy Mine in order to limit the potential impacts on local watersheds and archeological sites, as well as the smallest amount of communities, residents and sensitive environmental areas. In the project application, CP Rail points to the fact that half of the corridor is already being used as intensive cropland, which means that the native terrain and ecosystems of that area have already been disturbed. By choosing this route, environmental impacts are arguably limited because they are developing in an area that is not considered sensitive. Both the South and North valley walls were cut into, including cuts over deep on the South wall, and up to deep on the North wall. Not only was vegetation and earth disturbed in this process, but a number of aquifers were cut through in the South valley wall. Cuts through aquifers within the valley posed issues of drainage and erosion, and the creation of steeper embankments caused by excavation and rail grade construction created slope instability in the valley. The natural state of the valley has been altered significantly, and with this came the need for infrastructure implementation in order to accommodate drainage and crossings during the construction phase and into the future. This included concrete box culverts that were installed on the bottom of the river valley in order to allow excess floodwaters to continue to flow uninhibited. A report was made in February 2015 that acknowledged 23 landowners that relied on the aquifers—5 of whom were listed as potentially affected by the cuts on the South slope of the Valley. In order to ensure that existing cultural sites which have not been already disturbed by agriculture and other industry were not affected, a Heritage Resources Impact Assessment (HRIA) was conducted. Upon assessment, experts determined that this site had low potential for the discovery of cultural sites due to the agricultural disruption that occurred prior. Two historically significant sites were found within the footprint of the spur, and under direction from the Saskatchewan Heritage Conservation Branch there has been additional archeological work performed which resulted in controlled excavation and recovery of historical material.

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture has contributed to the increase of metal contamination in the Qu&#x27;Appelle watershed due to &quot;agricultural tilling, irrigation, and use of chemicals.&quot; This metal then accumulates in lake sediment, which will then impact the aquatic food webs within the lake. Peter Leavitt from the University of Regina states that this accumulation of metal toxins has occurred in the eggs of small aquatic invertebrates for 100 years.

<doc id="986718" wikidata="Q6481831" url="?curid=986718" title="Lamia (poem)">
<text>&quot;Lamia&quot; is a narrative poem written by the English poet John Keats, which first appeared in the volume &quot;Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St Agnes and Other Poems&quot;, published in July 1820. The poem was written in 1819, during the famously productive period that produced his 1819 odes. It was composed soon after his &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot; and his odes on Melancholy, on Indolence, on a Grecian Urn and to a Nightingale and just before &quot;To Autumn&quot;.
==Plot==
The poem tells how the god Hermes hears of a nymph who is more beautiful than all. Hermes, searching for the nymph, instead comes across Lamia, trapped in the form of a serpent. She reveals the previously invisible nymph to him and in return he restores her human form. She goes to seek a youth of Corinth, Lycius, while Hermes and his nymph depart together into the woods. The relationship between Lycius and Lamia, however, is destroyed when the sage Apollonius reveals Lamia&#x27;s true identity at their wedding feast, whereupon she seemingly disappears and Lycius dies of grief.
==Analysis==
According to Michael O&#x27;Neill, Lamia in the poem &quot;is treated ambivalently but with considerable sympathy&quot;, making &quot;a sharp contrast with the more leisurely and seemingly uncritical use of romance in [the] two narrative poems that follow ... the hapless Lycius is caught between the reductive rationalism of Apollonius and the bewitching illusoriness of Lamia.&quot;

==Influence==
At the &quot;immortal dinner party&quot; held by Benjamin Haydon on 28 December 1817, Keats agreed with Charles Lamb that Newton &quot;had destroyed all the poetry of the rainbow, by reducing it to the prismatic colours&quot;.

Keats&#x27;s poem had a deep influence on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s sonnet &quot;To Science&quot;, specifically this passage&#x27;s discussion of the baleful effects of &quot;cold philosophy&quot;:
Poe&#x27;s closing lines also echo several lines near the middle of &quot;Lamia&quot;. The book &quot;Unweaving the Rainbow&quot; by Richard Dawkins takes its title from the above-quoted passage: it is an explicit attempt to demonstrate that this view of &quot;cold philosophy&quot; is incorrect and that science reveals, rather than destroys, the true beauty of the natural world. The &quot;cold philosopher&quot; Apollonius kills both Lycius and Lamia.

The poem also inspired symphonic poems by Edward MacDowell (1888) and Dorothy Howell (1918).

==Productions==
The poem was dramatised on BBC Radio 4 on 1 January 2010 on the &quot;Afternoon Play&quot; series (later re-broadcast on 5 January 2012). The production was directed by Susan Roberts with original music composed and performed by John Harle. The cast included:
* Paterson Joseph ... Narrator
* Charlotte Emmerson ... Lamia
* Tom Ferguson ... Lycius
* Jonathan Keeble ... Hermes/Apollonius
* Sarah Leonard ... Singer

<doc id="986731" wikidata="Q5565678" url="?curid=986731" title="Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death">
<text>Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death is a comedy album by the Firesign Theatre that was released in 1998 on Rhino Records. Its main theme satirizes 1990s radio formats and public hysteria over the Y2K programming bug. &quot;Give Me Immortality...&quot; is the first of the Firesign Theatre&#x27;s Millennium CD trilogy &quot;We&#x27;re Doomed&quot;, which includes &quot;Boom Dot Bust&quot; and &quot;Bride of Firesign&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The album takes the form of a fictional radio broadcast on the night of December 31, 1999. Radio Now is a FunFunTown (apparently modeled after Los Angeles, California) radio station whose format changes approximately every hour at the slightest whims of overzealous market researchers and focus groups. The album chronicles Radio Now&#x27;s attempt to operate normally on the final day before the year 2000, a day riddled with apocalyptic omens, rampant computer errors, and dangerous doomsayers. The station is populated by DJ Bebop Loco (also known as Bebop Lobo) (Phil Austin), his producer Dwayne (Peter Bergman), news anchors Harold Hiphugger (David Ossman) and Ray Hamberger (Philip Proctor), sports commentator Chump Threads (Bergman), and self-help guru O&#x27;Nann Winquedinque (Austin). Also reporting from outside the station are celebrity stalker Danny Vanilla (Ossman) and helicopter-bound traffic reporter Col. Happy Panditt (Proctor).

==Themes==
The album, made in 1998, lampoons the various world-threatening results which were being predicted from the Y2K bug. It also satirizes the media exploitation of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the Joe Camel controversy, and Art Bell&#x27;s radio show &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;.

A running gag involves eyeballs, which at one moment represent binary digits (the digit 1 resembles the letter I, a homophone of &quot;eye&quot;, while the digit 0 is in the shape of a &quot;ball&quot;) and at other times seem to be an allusion to The Residents (&quot;Guyz in Eyeball Hats&quot;). Another is &quot;U.S. Plus&quot;, an apparent multi-national conglomerate with intentionally vague commercials that hint at their all-encompassing presence (&quot;We&#x27;re U.S. Plus. We own the &quot;idea&quot;...of America!&quot;). The urbane, sophisticated Goddess Airways commercials promise &quot;no bloody babies&quot; on their flights.

==References to earlier Firesign Theatre albums==
This is the second album by the Firesign Theatre to be set on December 31, 1999. The first was &quot;How Time Flys&quot; written by Ossman but featuring all four members of The Firesign Theatre in the cast.

Used car dealer Ralph Spoilsport (Proctor), last heard in &quot;How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You&#x27;re Not Anywhere at All&quot;, appears selling used body parts in a &quot;going out of body&quot; sale.

Newscasters Harold Hiphugger (Ossman) and Ray Hamberger (Proctor), introduced in &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot;, work at the &quot;Radio Now&quot; station.

Caroline Presskey (Proctor), a gameshow contestant on &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers&quot;, is heard in a telephone conversation.

<text>Perkins Bass (October 6, 1912 – October 25, 2011) was an American elected official from the state of New Hampshire, including four terms as a U.S. representative from 1955 to 1963.

==Biography==
Bass was born on October 6, 1912, in East Walpole, Massachusetts. He was the eldest son of former New Hampshire Governor Robert P. Bass and First Lady Edith B. Bass. Bass attended Milton Academy, graduated from Dartmouth College in 1934, and from Harvard Law School. He practiced as a lawyer and served in the United States Army Air Forces in Asia during World War II. He was elected state representative in 1939, 1941, 1947, and 1951, and as state senator in 1949, all to two-year terms. Bass voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, but voted present on the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

After serving four terms in the U.S. Congress, he ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in a 1962 special election. After defeating interim Senator Maurice J. Murphy Jr., Doloris Bridges, and Congressman Chester Merrow in the Republican primary, he was defeated in the general election by Democrat Thomas J. McIntyre. From 1972 to 1976, he served as a selectman of Peterborough, New Hampshire, where he lived until his death in 2011, aged 99.
